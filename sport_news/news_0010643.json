The championship will see the participation of 260 boxers, and provide Olympic qualification quotas to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. Based on the agreement signed between Aspetar and the championship’s local organising committee, the hospital will provide a number of medical services during the championship as part of National Sport Medicine Programme which will include an on-site team of doctors and experts who will be able to provide immediate care to the athletes, in addition to ambulances and a comprehensive mobile clinic. In conjunction with the championship, Aspetar will also organise a specialised medical conference on orofacial injuries in boxing on October 15 in the hospital’s auditorium, which will be attended by some of the field’s most renowned experts in Qatar and from around the world. The conference will discuss many topics, which will include facial and dental injuries in boxing, oral health and sports performance, surgical management of mandibular fractures, oral injury prevention, and more. In this regard, Aspetar’s sports dentistry department has created the Middle East’s first dental emergency kit that can help treat any in-competition injuries where oral trauma may occur, and assist in keeping athletes safe from further injury. Furthermore, as part of the National Sport Medicine Programme, Aspetar collaborates with clubs, federations and the Qatar Olympic Committee, in which it provides medical services to athletes participating in major sport events held in Qatar.
