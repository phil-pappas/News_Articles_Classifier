USC visits No. 14 Notre Dame (5-1) on Saturday. \nHaden wasn't specific about the reasons for Sarkisian's absence, only saying that \"it was very clear to me\" that the second-year USC coach was unwell. Haden asked Sarkisian to take a leave during a phone conversation. \nSarkisian publicly apologized before the season after he appeared to be intoxicated while making an unsteady public statement at the Salute to Troy pep rally. He announced he would be getting unspecified treatment but didn't believe he had a drinking problem, blaming his appearance on combining alcohol and medication. \nSarkisian is 12-6 with the Trojans, who were dropped from The Associated Press Top 25 after losing 17-12 to unranked Washington last Thursday. Sarkisian had been on the road recruiting during the long weekend but apparently wasn't in condition to lead practice Sunday, according to Haden. \nHaden informed the players of the change in a team meeting. Advertisement \nHelton begins his second stint as USC's interim coach. He led the Trojans to a Las Vegas Bowl victory in 2013, a calendar year in which the Trojans had four head coaches. Georgia: Running back Nick Chubb is expected to miss the rest of the season after injuring his left knee Saturday in the Bulldogs' loss at Tennessee. \"I think it's pretty safe to say he's out,\" coach Mark Richt said Sunday. \nThe star back was injured on the first play from scrimmage in the 38-31 loss. \nGeorgia's director of sports medicine said in a release Sunday that Chubb damaged several ligaments and cartilage but did not have an ACL tear. \nChubb came into the game with 13 consecutive 100-yard rushing games. \nThis marks the third consecutive season Georgia has seen its top running back go down to injury, following Keith Marshall in 2013 and Todd Gurley last year. Maryland: Randy Edsall was fired as Terrapins coach, less than 24 hours after the team's third straight lopsided defeat. The dismissal comes in the middle of Edsall's fifth season with Maryland. He is 22-34 since taking over in 2011. Rumors of Edsall's dismissal began last week, shortly before Maryland (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) lost 49-28 to No. 1 Ohio State. The defeat followed a 45-6 loss at West Virginia and a 28-0 embarrassment at home against Michigan. \nOffensive coordinator Mike Locksley will take over on an interim basis. \nIn June, Edsall received a contract extension that was to begin in January 2017 and was worth up to $7.5 million -- though only $500,000 was guaranteed. San Diego State 28, Hawaii 14: Donnel Pumphrey rushed for three touchdowns -- two in the first six minutes of the game -- and the Aztecs beat the Warriors 28-14 on Saturday night in Honolulu. San Diego State (3-3, 2-0 Mountain West) is San Jose State's homecoming opponent this Saturday. AP poll: Baylor is No. 2 and Utah is up to fourth behind No. 1 Ohio State in The Associated Press poll. The Bears have their best ranking ever. They reached No. 3 three times previously, including once last season. \nStanford moved up one spot to No. 15 despite not playing, and Cal remained 23rd after a 30-24 loss at Utah. \nVoters spread first-place votes around to six teams in the Top 25. The Buckeyes received 27, down 11 (38) from last week. Baylor has 13 and Utah has 16. No. 3 TCU received three first-place votes, and No. 5 Clemson and No. 9 Texas A&M each received one. \nGeorgia is out of the rankings for the first time since the end of 2013. North Texas: Offensive coordinator Mike Canales was chosen interim coach for the rest of the season, a day after coach Dan McCarney was fired following a 66-7 homecoming loss to FCS team Portland State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:17:01.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
