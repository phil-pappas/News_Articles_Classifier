We had no sales.\"\nOver the course of two years, from 2005 and 2006, the pair took out thousands of dollars in business loans from local banks and blew much of it on high-end electronics, a flashy BMW 3-series sedan, and elaborate parties catered by high-end restaurants, Amato told jurors. In Fattah's mind, he said, you had to look successful to be successful.\nMore coverage Friend: Fattah Jr. watched TV, rarely worked But Fattah - who has maintained that all of his businesses were legitimate, if not entirely thriving - brushed off those unflattering descriptions in an interview Tuesday.\n\"No, he's not being truthful,\" Fattah said of Amato's testimony. \"He's talking for the government up there.\"\nAmato could prove to be a key witness in the case against Fattah, the 32-year-old son of U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah (D., Pa.). Like his former roommate, Amato was charged with bank fraud in support of their fledgling businesses, which included a management consulting firm and a personal concierge service for high-end clientele.\nAmato agreed to plead guilty last year and wear a wire for the feds in an effort to get Fattah to incriminate himself.\nRecordings of several conversations the two had between 2011 and 2012 were played for jurors Tuesday. In hours recorded over Fattah's drink of choice - Belvedere vodka and cranberry juice - at R2L restaurant, Fattah proved to be enamored with his own ability at making deals and the trappings of a celebrity life.\n\"You know we got to ball, man,\" he said, according to a transcript of a May 2011 conversation. \"We have to live. This is how we do.\"\nHe reminisced about their old business failings and his new ventures - which included, at the time, a consulting job working as the chief operating officer of Delaware Valley High School, a for-profit education firm. He dropped names of the millionaires he knew - including rappers Beanie Sigel, Jay Z, and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs - and boasted of the tens of thousands of dollars he won and lost nightly at blackjack tables at the Borgata, SugarHouse, and Harrah's casinos.\nWhen it came to his father, Fattah had no qualms about crediting some of his success to sharing the congressman's name.\n\"He's had the power for my entire life,\" he said in another conversation.\nStill, he claimed to Amato that he often had to financially support his father because \"he only makes $170,000 a year.\"\nAnd while the congressman's wife, NBC10 news anchor Renee Chenault-Fattah, \"makes a . . . fortune,\" Fattah Jr. said, the congressman \"don't ask her for money.\"\n\"Think about it like you're out at dinner with eight people . . . and the bill is $800 or $600,\" he said. \"And you pay for it, because you don't want your wife to pull out her credit card - but in reality she can afford it.\"\nDescribing his own involvement in Fattah's business ventures, Amato's most colorful testimony Tuesday came in describing American Royalty, the duo's concierge service, which Amato depicted as little more than a boondoggle.\nFattah pitched the idea to his roommate soon after Amato graduated in 2005 with a business degree. Amato was intrigued.\n\"He got me excited because he said he had all these connections,\" Amato said. \"He had a name. His dad's a congressman. Everybody knew who he was and he had exclusive access to things.\"\nFor a year, the two worked together drawing up a business plan that boasted past experience representing more than 50 clients including celebrities. On Tuesday, Amato testified that those claims were mostly false.\nThey met with executives, including Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, in unsuccessful attempts to drum up business, but did most of their sales pitches to people they met while out at restaurants, bars, and nightclubs, he said.\nAmato told jurors they reached agreements with companies such as Cingular Wireless and Marquis Jet - a private plane service - to provide priority access for America Royalty's members, despite not having any clients at all.\nAll the while, he said, Fattah continued to think big. He once scheduled a tour for himself and Amato at the Beaumont condominiums in Old City, posing as buyers looking for units that started at $1 million.\n\"We thought we'd eventually be in a position to buy something like that,\" Amato said. \"We were thinking far ahead - silly far ahead.\"\nFattah - who is acting as his own lawyer - maintained that American Royalty had at least one client: Mikel Jones, a lawyer and longtime ally of Fattah's father who was sentenced to 31/2 years in prison in 2012 for fraud. The business once helped Jones get courtside seats for a 76ers game, Fattah noted while questioning his former roommate.\nIn his cross-examination, Fattah sought to portray what prosecutors have described as lies as just \"overly optimistic\" projections and to suggest that he was legitimately earning money to bankroll his expensive tastes.\nAt times, however, those questions appeared to border on boasting.\nReferencing a time he sneaked Amato and some friends into the Philadelphia Auto Show using a city-issued press credential, Fattah asked: \"We got some special treatment, right?\"\nLater he asked: \"Do you remember me having an Armani suit? A Trussini suit or anything from Boyds?\"\nAmato shrugged off what his former business partner was trying to imply with his questions.\n\"I was 22. We were trying to dream big and do big things,\" he said. \"I didn't think it was wrong at the time.\"\nThe cross-examination of Amato is expected to resume Wednesday.\njroebuck@phillynews.com\n215-854-2608 @jeremyrroebuck", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:39:06.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
