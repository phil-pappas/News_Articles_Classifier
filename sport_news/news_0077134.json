He also ran 15 times for 79 yards. \nAnd in his first game as the primary ballcarrier, freshman Raekwon James carried 20 times for 85 yards and caught eight passes for 56 yards. \nAnother freshman, Shane Hynes, kicked a pair of field goals. \nThe KSU defense shut down UMass QB Blake Frohnapfel, recording seven sacks including a safety, and next will get to test itself against the high-powered Bowling Green offense on Saturday. \nGetting his kicks: Kent State senior punter Anthony Melchiori (Aurora) had four straight impressive punts during the fourth quarter of Kent State's win. With his back foot just inside the back line of his end zone, Melchiori booted a 55-yard punt early in the fourth quarter. His next three punts were downed on the UMass 1-, 9- and 2-yard lines, respectively. In the first three quarters, Melchiori's punts included a 54-yarder and a pair of fair catches inside the 20. \nOn the rise: Toledo climbed to No. 19 in this week's Associated Press Top 25 poll, the highest the Rockets have been ranked since 1997 when they reached No. 18 for a week. The best ever for Toledo was No. 12 in the final poll of 1970. \nThe Rockets pounded Eastern Michigan on Saturday, 63-20, despite being kept off the board in the first quarter. It was a season-high point total for Toledo, as QB Phillip Ely threw for 327 yards and four touchdowns. \nToledo (6-0, 3-0) plays at UMass (1-5, 0-2) on Saturday. \nDefense rests: It was a long day for the Ohio Bobcats defensive unit in Saturday's 49-14 loss to Western Michigan. \nOU allowed a season-high 567 yards of total offense, including 430 on the ground. Two Broncos topped 100 yards rushing â€“ LeVante Bellamy had 149 on nine carries and Jamauri Bogan had 135 on nine carries -- and Jarvion Franklin finished with 95 yards on 13 carries. WMU averaged 9.8 yards per carry. Ohio had allowed just one 100-yard game this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:13:58.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
