And while Newton was serviceable Sunday night against the Eagles (he finished 14 of 24 for 197 yards with a touchdown and three interceptions -- though one of them was neither his fault nor an interception), the Panthers (6-0) didn't lack for MVP performances, starting with that stifling defense.\nLinebackers Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis , defensive lineman Kawann Short and cornerback Josh Norman all dominated . Kuechely, who missed three games earlier this season with a concussion, had eight tackles, Davis added 11, Norman had a fantastic pass breakup in the end zone to deny an Eagles touchdown (and only had one pass thrown his way all night for a whopping 3 yards), and Short had three sacks and a forced fumble.\nIf nothing else, it points to how coach Ron Rivera, in an era where the forward pass rules, has built a 6-0 team that thrives by running the ball and playing lights-out defense. \nAs long as we're passing out made-up awards, running back Jonathan Stewart deserves a nod; with Newton at less than his best, Stewart kept the chains moving, rushing 24 times for 125 yards. That running game, which ranks fourth in the league, according to Football Outsiders, also means that the Panthers can't be taken out of their offense if their biggest receiving threat -- tight end Greg Olsen -- is shut down. He had three receptions for 65 yards against the Eagles (3-4) but it didn't matter; Carolina controlled the game from start to finish.\nWith the win, the Panthers maintain their half-game lead over the Falcons (6-1) in the NFC South, though through a scheduling quirk, Carolina won't face Atlanta until Week 14 -- and then see them again two weeks later. For now, they're one of five unbeaten teams remaining. Cam Newton and the Panthers are 6-0. (USATSI) 1. The Eagles remain an enigma. Good news: Sam Bradford didn't look completely out of sorts, and, in fact, he made some pretty good throws against the Panthers. The problem: His receivers didn't show up; wideout Jordan Matthews continued his sophomore slump, and tight end Zach Ertz and wideout Miles Austin dropped back-to-back eminently catchable passes on Philly's penultimate drive to officially seal their fate.\n\"Kelly's Castoffs\" #SNF #PHIvsCAR pic.twitter.com/JKtAcQCvEN \n— SNF on NBC (@SNFonNBC) October 26, 2015 It's easy to wave your hands and say, \"That's what Chip Kelly gets for running off all that talent!\" but the reality is that DeSean Jackson has been injured for six weeks in Washington and nobody in their right mind is paying Jeremy Maclin $11 million a year. Also: Matthews, Ertz and Austin have to catch passes thrown right to them. That's not on Bradford or Kelly.\n2. Ryan Mathews is the Eagles' best running back. DeMarco Murray got paid this offseason, but it's Matthews, the former Chargers' first-round pick, who has looked like the Eagles' workhorse back. He rushed six times for 97 yards against the Panthers, including a 63-yard touchdown run. Murray, meanwhile, was slightly less productive.\nRyan Mathews: 6 carries for 97 yards, TD. DeMarco Murray, 18 carries for 65 yards, no TDs. #Eagles \n— Jeff McLane (@Jeff_McLane) October 26, 2015 We can put to rest who is the better athlete/runner between Murray and Mathews right here/right now. It is not even CLOSE.\n— Louis Riddick (@LRiddickESPN) October 26, 2015 In case there's any confusion, Riddick, who works for ESPN, is talking about Matthews.\n3. Eagles lost LT Jason Peters . This is a huge deal because Peters, 33, is arguably the team's best player. He's a seven-time Pro Bowler and when he went down with a back injury , Philly had to shuffle its offensive line to compensate. Matt Tobin did an admirable job for much of the night as Peters' replacement, but Jared Allen got the best of him on the next-to-last drive, twice sacking Bradford.\nWelcome to Carolina, @JaredAllen69 . #KeepPounding pic.twitter.com/Wjc4Ypd7Ba \n— Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) October 26, 2015 The Eagles' already-precarious situation gets worse if Peters is out for any length of time.\n4. No one knows what an interception is either. Not a week goes by where the NFL isn't trying to explain why a call defies all common sense and logic. Sunday was no different. On the first play of the Panthers' second drive, Newton connected with Ted Ginn , who appeared to go to the ground with the ball, only to have it ripped from his hands by Nolan Carroll .\nCommon sense and logic suggested Ginn was down by contact. But after review, it was determined that Newton had been intercepted by Carroll.\nCall stands. Eagles and Panthers swap picks. pic.twitter.com/ADfjet1WPp \n— NFL Network (@nflnetwork) October 26, 2015 Don't worry though, the NFL's VP of Officials can explain.\nOn the Ginn play he has to maintain control all the way to ground. It comes out as he lands so no catch, and interception stands\n— Dean Blandino (@DeanBlandino) October 26, 2015 To recap: No one knows what a catch is .\n5. Newton still had a record-setting night. It may not have been an MVP performance, but Newton scored a rushing touchdown, which brings his career total to 37 , one better than Michael Vick.\nSuperCam keeps it. SuperCam stretches. SuperCam gets 6. #PHIvsCAR https://t.co/bdraPd8pYd \n— NFL (@NFL) October 26, 2015 For some perspective, Newton did it in 68 games; Vick has 36 scores in 143 games.\n6. Mike Tolbert cannot be stopped. Partially because he's built like a brick outhouse, but also because the Eagles displayed some pretty terrible tackling on this otherwise amazing touchdown run .\nOne. Two. Three. Four... Just counting the Eagles that tried to stop Mike Tolbert. #touchdown #PHIvsCAR https://t.co/2ctW4owxAX \n— NFL (@NFL) October 26, 2015 7.

Colts' general manager Ryan Grigson, who gave up a first-round pick for Richardson.\n9. Next up. The 6-0 Panthers face the hapless Colts on Monday Night Football while the 3-4 Eagles, who are one game behind the Giants in the division, travel to Dallas to square off against Matt Cassel and the 2-4 Cowboys.\nTopics: Cam Newton , DeMarco Murray , DeSean Jackson , Greg Olsen , Jared Allen , Jason Peters , Jeremy Maclin , Jonathan Stewart , Jordan Matthews , Josh Norman , Kawann Short , Luke Kuechly , Matt Cassel , Matt Tobin , Mike Tolbert , Miles Austin , Nolan Carroll , Ryan Mathews , Sam Bradford , Ted Ginn , Thomas Davis , Zach Ertz , Ryan Wilson , Carolina Panthers , Philadelphia Eagles , NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:08:28.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
