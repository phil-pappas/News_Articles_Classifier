(AP) - The bust of a Confederate general at Vicksburg National Military Park is being moved.\nThe Vicksburg Post reports ( http://bit.ly/1G81lx4 ) severe erosion has forced the park to remove the bust of Confederate Maj. Gen. William Henry Talbot Walker from its location on Clay Street near Melborn Place.\nPark Superintendent Bill Justice says the statue will be relocated at a later date to another site near the location it occupied. Justice says rain runoff flows into a ravine behind the statue where soil is eroding.\nSupervisory Park Ranger Raymond Hamell says Walker was a member of the relief force commanded by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston that attempted to reinforce Gen. John C. Pemberton during the Siege of Vicksburg in 1863. Walker died during the battle of Atlanta in July 1864.\nInformation from: The Vicksburg Post, http://www.vicksburgpost.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
