Smith. \nTop reserves: Matthew Dellavedova, Tristan Thompson, Anderson Varejao, Mo Williams , Iman Shumpert. \nThe self-proclaimed best player in the world won't have to do it alone this time, assuming the rash of injuries that hit the Cavaliers in the playoffs finally subsides. Love and Irving are both expected back to help James try to fulfill his dream of bringing a title to his home state. Thompson will come along as well now that he has agreed to a new contract. \n2. Toronto \nProjected starters: Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, DeMarre Carroll , Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Patterson. \nTop reserves: Terrence Ross, Luis Scola , Cory Joseph , Bismack Biyombo . \nThe Raptors filled a dual role last season as one of the biggest surprises (a 37-17 start) and disappointments (a 12-16 finish followed by a first-round playoff sweep by Washington). They hope to undergo a stylistic change after being one of the worst ball-movement teams in the NBA. It should help that Lowry appeared in playoff form in the preseason and newcomer Joseph spent four seasons in pass-heavy San Antonio. \n3. Atlanta \nProjected starters: Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver, Kent Bazemore. \nTop reserves: Tiago Splitter , Tim Hardaway Jr. , Thabo Sefalosha, Dennis Schroder. \nAs if he needed help imparting The Spurs' Way, Coach Mike Budenholzer imported someone intimately familiar with the system in Splitter. Of course, the Hawks have become an enviable brand themselves after finishing with the best record in the East last season and Atlanta made the conference finals for the first time. Is that the ceiling for a team with talent but no stars? \n4. Chicago \nProjected starters: Pau Gasol, Nikola Mirotic, Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose, Tony Snell. \nTop reserves: Taj Gibson, Joakim Noah, Doug McDermott, Kirk Hinrich, Bobby Portis . \nHmm … Iowa State prodigy replaces widely beloved Bulls coach. What could go wrong? A lot, if Fred Hoiberg's time in Chicago is anything like that of Tim Floyd, who took over for Phil Jackson and went 49-190. Good thing for Hoiberg that his starters don't include Floyd's crew of Dickey Simpkins, Mark Bryant and Randy Brown. These Bulls should be just fine if Rose's body cooperates. \n5. Milwaukee \nProjected starters: Jabari Parker, Michael Carter-Williams, Greg Monroe , Khris Middleton, Rashad Vaughn . \nTop reserves: Giannis Antetokounmpo, O.J. Mayo, John Henson, Greivis Vasquez . \nThe Bucks are essentially adding two major pieces in newcomer Monroe and Parker, who returns after a torn knee ligament ended his rookie season after only 25 games. If Middleton can sustain his impressive all-around play from after the All-Star break last season, Milwaukee should contend for home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. \n6. Washington \nProjected starters: John Wall, Bradley Beal, Marcin Gortat, Otto Porter, Kris Humphries. \nTop reserves: Gary Neal , Ramon Sessions, Nene, Kelly Oubre , Jared Dudley . \nThe small-ball approach that worked so well in the playoffs is back, with one exception: Paul Pierce is no longer around to play power forward and make game-winning shots. But that shouldn't derail a team that largely relies on its backcourt of Wall and Beal. Gortat should be one of the primary beneficiaries of an offensive system that provides better spacing than its predecessor. \n7. Charlotte \nProjected starters: Al Jefferson, Kemba Walker, Nicolas Batum , Marvin Williams, Jeremy Lamb . \nTop reserves: Jeremy Lin , Spencer Hawes , Cody Zeller, P.J. Hairston, Frank Kaminsky . \nThese Hornets could produce a playoff buzz thanks to an infusion of complementary players intended to take pressure off Jefferson and Walker. Batum should be an adequate replacement — and an upgrade offensively — for Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, lost for the season after shoulder surgery. Leaving Los Angeles should be a good thing for Lin and Hawes, who seek bounce-back seasons. \n8. Miami \nProjected starters: Chris Bosh, Goran Dragic, Dwyane Wade, Hassan Whiteside, Luol Deng. \nTop reserves: Gerald Green , Justise Winslow , Josh McRoberts, Mario Chalmers, Amare Stoudemire . \nThe Heat finally has the starting lineup it has wanted since February, when the team acquired Dragic but Bosh's blood clots sidelined him for the rest of the season. The big question is how often Wade will be in it after missing 20 games last season and needing a maintenance plan to remain fresh for a playoff push. Green should both thrill and baffle off the bench with his high-volume shooting. \nEARLY OFF-SEASON:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:07:30.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
