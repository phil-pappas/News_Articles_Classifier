Buy this photo MITSU YASUKAWA/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Kennedy’s Jaron Jordan finishes first in the Big North Liberty race Tuesday during the Big North Liberty and Independence Championships at Garret Mountain in Woodland Park. \nThe Bulldogs ended the Mustangs’ championship run, which stretched back to 1999. \n“We’ve had some issues with getting all our kids to the line in the same race,” said Passaic Tech boys coach Dean Campiglia. \n“But we found Jackson, who left soccer early in the season to come run and this was a nice win for our kids.” \nKennedy’s Jeron Jordan won the race in 16:48, and continues his quest to become the first freshman to win the Passaic County title, which will be run here Oct. 23. \nWayne Hills won its second straight boys Big North Independence title, 20-51, over Wayne Valley, as George Galkin led the Patriots to a 1-2-4-6-7 finish. Galkin wasn’t pleased with his race, finishing in 17:00, about 60 meters ahead of teammate Joe Zisa. \n“I just didn’t feel 100 percent [Tuesday],” said Galkin. “I should be ready for [the county meet] next week, though.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:36:19.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
