(Photo by John Kelley) UGA women's basketball embracing under-the-radar status: 'We're absolutely underdogs' By Chris Starrs sports@onlineathens.com – published Wednesday, October 21, 2015 The Georgia women’s basketball team enters the 2015-16 season in an unfamiliar position — as the underdog. That’s not surprising, given the season most of these Lady Bulldogs — including four returning starters — endured a year ago. After opening with 12 consecutive wins and getting off to a 4-1 start in Southeastern Conference play, Georgia was beset with injury and illness and floundered. The Lady Bulldogs finished 19-12 overall, 6-10 in conference play (which included an eight-game losing streak) and missed out on the NCAA tournament for the first time in decades. So it could be argued that the underdog role is duly appropriate, and perhaps even welcomed. “We’re absolutely underdogs,” Joni Crenshaw, who succeeded Andy Landers as head coach earlier this year, said. “I feel that way and I think our girls feel that way, too. I’m going to make sure they get that. People might overlook us or might even not know what to expect from us. “We’ve worked really hard in talking about that message and making sure they understand they have a chance to do something really special. …There are no excuses. This is a very experienced team and I’m new as head coach but I’m not new to them, so I’m trying to take away any excuse that might creep into their minds.” Senior center Merritt Hempe characterized last season as an educational experience. \"We’ve learned a lot from last season. We started out well and then we had injuries and sickness and in a snap it was gone from us,” the 6-foot-2 Hempe, who missed five games due to illness, said. “It was really hard but we learned how to fight when we were down and maybe we didn’t always come back and win, but there were a lot of games when we kept fighting. “There were definitely takeaways from the season, like learning how to deal with adversity. It will help us this year.” “We had such a poor season,” sophomore forward Mackenzie Engram added. “But coming off that season is just motivation going into the new year. We don’t want to have a repeat of last year, so I think people will come out every day more determined.” Key to Georgia’s success will be the performance of four seniors who have logged plenty of minutes and have known both good times and bad as Lady Bulldogs. Hempe, forward Shacobia Barbee and guards Tiaria Griffin and Marjorie Butler are all coming up on their final seasons, so there’s certainly a sense of urgency abounding. “For myself, it’s something I wake up and think about every day,” Hempe said. “Every day when I wake up, I think, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m a senior — this is it.’ And every day before workouts I think, ‘I can’t get today back.’ The season hasn’t started and I already have that mentality. It’s very anxious for me.” The best news in the Georgia camp is that Barbee, a two-time All-SEC selection, will be back at full strength after suffering a foot injury 21 games into the season (at which time the Lady Bulldogs were 17-4). “The first time Cobi touched the basketball since her injury in January was our summer workout in June and I was unbelievably impressed with how sharp she was,” Taylor said. “Most players that take off that much time are going to be a little rusty in terms of shooting the basketball or handling it. She didn’t miss a beat. She had a little bit of pain that is subsiding every day but from a skill standpoint, she didn’t miss a beat at all.” \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
