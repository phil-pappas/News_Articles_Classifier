(Tribune News Service) — Johnie and Madgeline Hamilton served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 20 years, which is why they're excited to be attending Military Appreciation Day on Saturday at Beaver Stadium where Penn State will take on Army West Point. They'll get to see their son, Nittany Lions wide receiver DaeSean Hamilton, compete in the game. Being the son of military people, Hamilton might have thought about attending a service academy, but he said his parents were against it. \"They wanted me to stay away from that route because of what they had to go through,\" said Hamilton, who was born in Okinawa. \"My parents grew up in Chicago, a poor family, poor upbringing, so they thought the military was their only way out. With all the things they went through like boot camps, the endless hours, all the travel, the sleepless nights, the sleepless days, working nonstop to bring in income for their families, they felt like they didn't want me to have that same type of life. \"They taught me to go to school, and if football doesn't work out, just make sure I have my grades right and get my degree.\" He said his parents are so excited by Saturday's game that \"they circled this game on their calendar early this season.\" \"They love everything about the Marine Corps, love everything about the military. They've always preached to me about their time in the military and things like that. I've learned to appreciate [the military] and be humble.\" Another Penn State player with military connections is quarterback Christian Hackenberg, a graduate of Fork Union (Va.) Military Academy. His uncle, Justin Hackenberg, played defensive tackle at Army from 1992 through 1995 and then served 12 years in the military before retiring with the rank of major. \"I have a ton of respect for that program [Army] specifically and the things that are asked of those guys following their playing years there,\" he said. \"It's something that means a lot to me and my family.\" Nittany Lions coach James Franklin said Penn State supporters donated upward of 10,000 tickets to service members for Saturday. The game is officially a sellout although a forecast of rainy, windy weather could keep fans away. The Lions (3-1), who come in with a three-game winning streak, are playing the Black Knights (1-3) for the first time since 1979 when Matt Suhey rushed for 223 yards in a 24-3 win at Beaver Stadium. Army lost its first three games of the season by a total of 10 points before breaking through last week in a 58-36 win at Eastern Michigan, a victory that snapped a 21-game regular-season road losing streak. A question entering the game is whether sophomore quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw will play. Bradshaw, Army's top rusher with 341 yards, suffered an ankle injury last week and his status is unknown. Senior A.J. Schurr scored two touchdowns in relief of Bradshaw. \"He kept the game going and made some great plays himself, both running the ball and throwing the ball,\" second-year Army head coach Jeff Monken said of Schurr. \"I hope we'll have Bradshaw ready to go and have both of those guys available to play.\" ——— Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
