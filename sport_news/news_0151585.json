Rewatch Kentucky’s four wins this season Photo by UK Athletics \nIf you just can’t go without a UK football fix, why not do your own midseason review and watch UK’s four wins this season? There have been a lot of highlights, and, yes, a few lowlights. In fact, you have our permission to skip the second half of the Louisiana Lafayette game and the first half of the Eastern game. Instead, focus on Towles’ growing rapport with his receivers, the balanced rushing attack, and a defense that proved us all wrong. 6. Try to actually learn the words to “Grove Street Party” \nLike many of you, I can only decipher “I GOT A WHOLE LOTTA MONEY” and “It’s a party, it’s a party, it’s a party.” With another big game coming up and plenty of opportunities to play the song, why don’t we learn the actual wor—YEAAAAH, just kidding. I googled the lyrics. No need to learn them. Let’s just stick with the parts we know, okay? Especially you kiddos out there. “Grove Street Party” on iTunes: $1.29 7. Catch up on other college football \nThe slate of games is kind of meh this week, but I’ll be watching Tennessee vs. Georgia on CBS at 3:30 p.m. to get my first good look at the imploding Volunteers. Other interesting games on the docket: #10 Oklahoma vs. Texas , ABC, Noon: This will be a massacre, but I can’t turn away from watching Charlie Strong’s train wreck at Texas #13 Northwestern vs. #18 Michigan , BTN, 3:30 p.m.: LOL, just kidding. Go Wildcats though. #7 LSU vs. South Carolina , 3:30 p.m.: It was nice of LSU to host the game since Columbia’s under water, but before we praise the magnanimous Tigers too much, people do realize they get a home game out of it, right? Leonard Fournette will roll. Arkansas at #8 Alabama , 7 p.m., ESPN: I refuse to believe Arkansas is as terrible as they’ve looked and that Alabama is as good as they looked against Georgia. Regardless, Tide will roll. #11 Florida at Missouri , 7:30 p.m., SEC Network: No way Florida keeps this up, right? \nIf you’re watching at home: More of that Shipyard Pumpkinhead Ale: $9.99/6-pack Pizza and/or wings from local chain: $15-$20 Watching games without putting on real pants: Priceless \nIf you’re watching at the bar: Pitcher of beer: $12-$18 Chance to laugh at sad Tennessee fans: Priceless 8. Watch the NBA Cats ball in exhibition games \nIf you’re really desperate for some UK sports and have NBATV, you’re in luck. The network will be airing preseason NBA games throughout the weekend and because former Kentucky players are all over the league, there are ample opportunities to check them out. Here’s a schedule of games on NBATV: Friday, 7 p.m.: New York Knicks @ Washington Wizards ( John Wall, Josh Harrellson ) Saturday, 8 p.m.: Chicago Bulls @ Minnesota Timberwolves ( Karl Towns ) Sunday, 1:30 a.m.: LA Clippers ( Chuck Hayes ) @ Charlotte Hornets (MKG–injured, Aaron Harrison ) Sunday, 9:20 p.m.: Haifa @ Los Angeles Lakers ( Julius Randle ) \nCost? NBATV is part of the premiere sports package on most cable/satellite plans, but really, if you look at it reasonably, it’ll practically pay for itself considering the number of former Cats you’ll watch this season. 9. Clean the house \nIt’s never fun, but think of the brownie points you’ll earn with your spouse or significant other! Windex: $3.99 409 cleaner: $4.49 Your spouse or significant other being cool with you tailgating early Thursday instead of picking up the kids from school: Priceless 10. Watch UK’s practice Sunday night on ESPNU \nThe weekend isn’t totally devoid of UK sports. On Sunday night from 7-9 p.m., ESPNU will air UK’s basketball practice, giving you your first glance of the 2015-2016 Kentucky Wildcats, most notably the newcomers. According to UK, the practice will include drills, 3-on-3, and 5-on-5 scrimmaging, so, plenty of opportunities to see what Skal, Jamal Murray, Isaiah Briscoe, Isaac Humphries, Charles Matthews, and Mychal Mulder can do. Cal claims his team stinks right now, but for at least two hours on Sunday night, we’ll be the judge of that. ESPNU: Part of most cable/satellite sports packages or FREE with a friend’s cable sign-in Sunday evening beverage: Whatever you’ve got in the house Kentucky basketball on national television in October: Priceless UPDATE: 11. Keeneland, duh \nSee what happens when you live outside of Kentucky long enough? The best pastimes slip your mind. How could I forget Keeneland?! You should definitely do that. Save some whiskey sours for me, I’ll be there next Saturday. Admission: $5 Keeneland beer (it’s different there!): $4 Whiskey sour: $6.25", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:46:34.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
