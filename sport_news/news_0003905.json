According to Chris Haynes of the Cleveland Plain Dealer , the Cavs and Thompson's agent, Rich Paul, have stopped communicating as both sides are playing a game of chicken to see who will yield first. \nThere's no communication ongoing between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Thompson's agents, Rich Paul and Mark Termini, Northeast Ohio Media Group has learned.\nIn fact, there doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency from either side in reaching an agreement.\nThis doesn't sound ideal.\nThe Cavs may not need Thompson at the start of the season, especially since Kevin Love appears to be ready to play but the longer this drags out, the longer it will take for Cleveland to be a cohesive unit. This is why LeBron James has called Thompson's holdout a distraction and has advocated for both sides to work things out .\nBesides these two instances, James has not inserted himself into the negotiations. He wants Thompson's agent and the Cavs to come to an agreement on their own. James is, however, concentrating on how Thompson is holding up throughout the whole situation. \nFrom Haynes:\nJames has been in constant contact with Thompson throughout the negotiations. He has made it clear the importance of ending the impasse as soon as possible.\n\"I try not to get involved in that, as far as what the team is speaking on or talking about,\" James said about the stalled negotiations. \"It's basically more on a personal level, asking him how he's doing and if his mind is right and things of that nature. There's a lot of things that's much bigger than basketball, even though I know he would love to be here right now and we would love to have him here, but I kind of stray away from that.\"\nAs Thompson's friend, this is a solid move by James. Instead of being treated like he's not part of the team, James seems to be going out of his way to check in and make sure Thompson knows everyone is still thinking about him.\nYet as the leader of the Cavs, whose opinion carries a lot of weight, James may need to take a more active role in pushing both sides to come to an agreement. Especially since there doesn't seem to be an end in near sight for this standoff. Teammates and friends.
