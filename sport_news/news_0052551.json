Mike has been working Sundays since he learned how to ride a bike and would wake up before 5 a.m., even in the winter, even if there was one of those thick and heavy Boston snowstorms, to bike his paper route in Abington.\n“He liked the money,” Norm Hazen said. “And he was willing to work. He earned it.”\nMike Hazen has to work, and work harder than anyone else, he thinks. That’s the only way. Maybe high school came easy to him, when he pulled the grades at Abington High to help him get him into Princeton, but who knows if he would have gotten into the Ivy League school without his baseball accolades.\n“I don’t know how I got into Princeton,” he said. “My parents are teachers from a small town in Massachusetts. I mean, it could’ve been anybody. I don’t know how they picked me over someone else. I don’t know.”\nLike everything he’s accomplished in his 39 years, the always-humble Hazen shrugs it off.\nTalk to him for an hour and it almost seems as if he believes anybody could be the general manager of the Red Sox.\nHere’s what you’d need to do:\nWork\nHazen grew up outdoors, playing soccer, basketball and baseball, and tagging along to Fenway Park with his dad. But he couldn’t leave the house until his homework was done.\nHe learned from his parents. Norm Hazen went to Central Connecticut and Lois Hazen went to Northeastern, paying for tuition with money from her co-op jobs. They both became teachers. When they had children, Lois stopped working to take care of the kids, Norm picked up two more jobs as a landscaper and painter; he worked seven days a week.\n“I learned it from my parents,” Mike said.\nEvaluate\nThe hardest baseball decision Mike Hazen ever had to make was about a 6-foot-1, 195-pound outfielder who hit .307 with a .919 OPS as a 23-year-old in rookie league in 1998. The next year, riddled by shoulder problems, he hit just .203 with a .608 OPS in Single A and was released by the San Diego Padres.\nThat player was Mike Hazen.\nHis college coach at Princeton, Scott Bradley, called and said there might be a chance to catch on with another team, but reaching the majors seemed like a longshot. Hazen pulled the plug and retired at 24.\n“Look, I feel like having some self-evaluation skills is an important piece to any job,” he said. “And I felt like I had them. I wasn’t very good.”\nBradley called sportswriter Peter Gammons, who found baseball-minded youngsters to scout the Cape Cod Baseball League during the summer. Eager and willing, Hazen shacked up with his grandmother, who had a house down there, and scouted three games a day. He filed his reports at the end of the year.\nGammons read them, then called Mark Shapiro, who became the general manager of the Cleveland Indians in 2001.\n“Peter was over the top just passionate about the quality of work, knowledge of the game and the passion Mike had,” Shapiro, the soon-to-be president of the Toronto Blue Jays, said. “He’s smart and he knows the game, but he also has that ability to connect with people, which is not a given. To me, that’s a separator.”\nListen\nWorking in player development isn’t exactly a redeeming job. Unlike a scout, you don’t attach your name to a prospect and shine in their glory. The job requires relationship building, talking to young players, hiring coaches, talking to coaches and facilitating communication from field level to the front office.\nIt’s a very political job, which is fitting, since Hazen majored in political science at Princeton, following in the footsteps of Woodrow Wilson, Donald Rumsfeld and Michelle Obama, among others.\n“I was surprised he picked that, but he could’ve been a politician,” Norm Hazen said. “He could run a government office. That’s the quality we saw in him all the way through. He was always everybody’s friend. He was always excited for other people to be successful. That’s one of his strong suits.”\nChris Antonetti, now the president of the Indians, saw those same qualities in Hazen until he left Cleveland for the Red Sox organization in 2006.\n“He’s a dynamic personality and a guy that is a perfect teammate, a guy you want to spend time around,” Antonetti said. “He has all of those attributes to be a very successful leader, regardless of the industry. It just so happens his passion is baseball and that’s what he chose to pursue.”\nDo anything\nHazen isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty.\nHe’s done it before, when he was still with the Indians as an intern and was on copy-boy duty during his first winter meetings, coincidentally held in Boston. Among his primary responsibilities as copy boy was the all-important job of handling the printer. Before smart phones, the printer provided baseball decision-makers with everything they needed at events like the winter meetings, and it was no small task to oversee.\nWell, the printer ran out of ink and Hazen hadn’t the foresight to bring an extra cartridge. He was told there was a Best Buy in the Cambridge Galleria, so he grabbed the empty cartridge to use as a reference, hailed a cab from Copley Place and made his way into Best Buy to purchase a matching replacement.\nThis riveting story of printer maintenance takes quite the turn as Hazen made his way back to Indians headquarters and the cartridge wouldn’t fit. There was a piece missing. A piece, Hazen recalled, that was attached to the old cartridge that he deposited in a garbage can outside Best Buy. Hazen exited the room again, took a cab back to Best Buy, found the grimy receptacle and clawed his way through. There it was, the very piece the Indians couldn’t live without, covered in filth. He returned more than an hour after he had originally left — stinking of garbage, probably.\nIf that isn’t dedication and loyalty, what is?\n“I’ve been very fortunate,” he said. “I’ve worked hard. I might not be as smart as someone else or as talented, but I’m a big believer in hard work and being authentic and forming relationships. The rest will take care of itself.”\nMike Hazen, new general manager of the Red Sox, will climb into a Boston area garbage can for this team if he has to.\nIn his eyes, it’s an everyman’s job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:54:42.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
