(AP) - Jay Cutler led Chicago to a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns, including an alert toss to running back Matt Forte with 18 seconds left, giving the Bears a stunning 18-17 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.\nThe Bears (2-3) trailed 17-3 early in the third quarter when Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles went down with a potentially serious knee injury. Kansas City's offense quickly dropped off, and that allowed Chicago to mount a comeback for its second straight last-minute win.\nCutler threw for 252 yards and two touchdowns, the first a 22-yard strike to Marquess Wilson with 3:05 left in the game. After the Bears forced a quick three-and-out, Cutler drove them inside the 10-yard line. He took a snap in the shotgun, dropped it, then spotted Forte in the end zone.\nThe Chiefs (1-4) tried a 66-yard field goal that came up short as time expired.\nFBN-RAMS-PACKERS \nPackers' defense backs Rodgers in 24-10 win over Rams\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - Aaron Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and 241 yards, and the Green Bay Packers held off the St. Louis Rams for a 24-10 win on Sunday in spite of three turnovers by their normally mistake-free quarterback.\nRodgers connected with receivers Ty Montgomery and James Jones for long scoring strikes.\nBut NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis' diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3).\nRodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third.\nRelentless pressure on quarterback Nick Foles helped keep the Packers (5-0) unbeaten. Foles threw a career-worst four interceptions, two in the fourth quarter inside the Packers 10.\nBBA-ALDS-ROYALS-ASTROS \nAstros take 2-1 series lead over Royals with 4-2 win\nHOUSTON (AP) - Dallas Keuchel remained perfect at home with seven gutsy innings and Chris Carter homered Sunday, leading the Houston Astros to a 4-2 win over the Kansas City Royals to take a 2-1 lead in the American League Division Series.\nThe Astros could wrap up the best-of-five series with a win over the defending AL champions in Game 4 on Monday.\nKeuchel (2-0) worked out of jam after jam, allowing five hits and one run with seven strikeouts after going 15-0 at home this season, a modern major league record.\nLuke Gregerson gave up a leadoff homer in the ninth to Alex Gordon before finishing off the Astros first playoff game in Houston in 10 years with a four-out save. It was save of more than three outs in three years.\nJason Castro drove in two runs with a single in the fifth that made it 2-1. Carlos Gomez, who has a rib muscle strain, started for the first time in the series and had an RBI single in the sixth.\nBBN-NLDS-CARDINALS-CUBS \nCardinals bracing for Game 3 of NLDS against Arrieta, Cubs\nCHICAGO (AP) - St. Louis manager Mike Matheny says the Cardinals are preparing for Game 3 of the NL Division Series in \"the same boring way\" they have all season long.\nThe Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs are tied at one game apiece heading into the first playoff game at Wrigley Field in seven years. Oh, the Cubs also will have Jake Arrieta on the mound on Monday night for his first start since he shut out Pittsburgh in the wild-card game.\nMatheny says the Cardinals have been counted out before against ace pitchers in the postseason, and then had success. But the NL Central champions are heading for quite a challenge in Arrieta, who hasn't lost at home since July 25.\nArrieta says the Cubs are \"in a great spot.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
