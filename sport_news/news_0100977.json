This game could have gone either way. It was your typical old school power struggle. You could tell that the rain had a strong effect on game planning and ball security throughout. White County scored early in the first quarter to put them up 7-0 but it probably shouldn’t have counted. The Warriors clearly jumped prior to the snap. I feel like the Jets did a good job moving the ball through the air early. Quarterback Tyler Howard managed to put seven points on the board after a short pass to Michael Miller and the Jets went to the locker room tied with White County 7-7. The second half was a wild one. It had appeared the contest was going to be a barn burner but a late error against White County was the turning point of the game. The Jets were not able to take advantage of good field position after an interception had flipped the field. However, White County’s long snapper skipped a ball past his punter and the Jets retained possession on the Warrior’s one-yard line. From there, Jets running back Jake Kerley punched it in to make it a 14-7 game. Moments later the White County long snapper committed yet another error by snapping the ball over his punter's head, resulting in a safety and a 16-7 Jets lead. Cumberland County almost had a similar incident happen a series later but punter Jeremiah Baird remained composed, located the ball and was able to send the ball out of harm's way. At this point, it seemed as though Cumberland County was going to walk away with the game but a streaker stormed the field and it felt like the incident stole some of the Jets momentum. The incident seemed to lull the Jet defense to sleep because White County moved right down the field, scored a touchdown and a two-point conversion to make it 16-15. Cornerback Nathan Blaylock sealed the Warrior’s fate with a late interception that allowed the Jet's offense to take the victory formation and put the game away. Coach Ken Johnson and his staff have now moved Cumberland County to 3-2 on the season. The Jets play Hixion on Oct. 2 for homecoming.
