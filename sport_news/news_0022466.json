Geelong’s Steve Johnson joins AFL club GWS \nFormer Geelong star Steve Johnson will continue his AFL career at Greater Western Sydney after signing a one-year deal with the club on Monday. \nGeelong received a future fifth-round draft selection in exchange, having decided not to offer the three-time premiership player a new contract after 253 games. \nGWS coach Leon Cameron was tightlipped on reports that Johnson will start his coaching career at the expansion club. \n“Steve has agreed to a one-year playing contract and at the end of next season we’ll sit down with him and assess what opportunities are available at the club beyond 2016,” Cameron said. \n“Steve obviously brings a wealth of experience to our playing group and will be a huge asset in terms of developing our younger players. \n“But first and foremost he is an intense competitor and is extremely hungry for on-field success. \n“He continues to have the highest of expectations when it comes to his on-field performance.” \nMeanwhile, Geelong continued their recruiting spree on Monday by signing up Gold Coast ruckman Zac Smith. \nThe Cats shipped off a pair of third-round draft picks in exchange for Smith, while the Suns then offloaded selection No.53 to acquire North Melbourne ruckman Daniel Currie. \nAdelaide superstar Patrick Dangerfield, West Coast’s Scott Selwood and Carlton forward Lachie Henderson joined the Cats last week. \nBrisbane were the other active club on Monday morning, picking up Carlton utility Tom Bell plus Geelong’s Josh Walker and Jarrad Jansen. \nThe Lions are understandably keen to sign AFL-ready talent after last week’s departure of ruckman Matthew Leuenberger and on-baller Jack Redden. \nJames Aish has also voiced his desire to leave and join Collingwood, but Lions list manager Peter Schwab suggested the Magpies were yet to talk turkey. \n“They’re the club that he’s indicating he wants to go to, so Collingwood need to satisfy Brisbane before a deal can be done,” Schwab told AFL Trade Radio. \n“We’ve had a lot of discussions but nothing really put on the table. \n“What we don’t want to come out with is James Aish for a second-round pick. That won’t do it. He will go through (to the draft) if that is the case.” \nThe league’s trade period ends on Thursday.
