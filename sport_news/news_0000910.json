The senior leadership is one thing. She's rock solid as a defender and she comes forward well. She shoots the ball well. Hals does a lot of things well. And last year, the whole season we were without her. So I'm thrilled for her that she's had the opportunity to come back from the minor injury of this season and of course come away with the winning goal.\" \nTigers freshman midfielder Maggie Motolese delivered the corner kick, which was gathered by Hebelka, who then deposited it into the back of the net. Haley Hebelka (Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com) \n\"A beautiful cross from the corner,\" Hebelka said. \"I just went for it and crashed the net.\" \nFinding the back of the net isn't something Hebelka is used to. \n\"My second goal of my career. I don't score too often,\" Hebelka said. \nSaucon Valley, which didn't lose a league game all season and hasn't lost since its first game on Sept. 4, was without leading scorer Lauren Binn and key defender Ashleigh Nagy. They both tore ACLs last week. \nThe Tigers took advantage of the the short-handed Panthers, controlling possession much of the game, especially in the first half. \n\"Saucon Valley is like the best team in the Colonial League right now and to get a win over them is like the best feeling in the world,\" Hebelka said. \n\"We really focused on defending and defending as a team,\" Hebelka added. \"We wanted to just keep them from shooting and using their strengths.\" \nSophomore goalkeeper McKenna Amey made three saves to preserve the Tigers' shutout. \n\"That was such an amazing win,\" Amey said. \"We have been practicing so hard, working on everything. We just did everything perfectly tonight. And we came out and we wanted to dominate and we did. We did amazing.\" \nAlong with Hebelka, Motolese returned from injury on Tuesday night, giving the Tigers a needed boost after they saw their struggles towards the end of the regular season. \n\"It definitely helps to have almost our whole team back and healthy again and able to participate,\" Bleam said. \"I think that having everybody healthy for the most part tonight really contributed to the heart and emotion of the team.\" \nThe Tigers will go for their third straight league title on Thursday night against Southern Lehigh, a team they beat 4-1 on Oct. 5. \n\"It feels amazing. I'm so grateful for my team and my coaches,\" Hebelka said. \"We're just going to keep working on defending and trying to get our shots off and working as a team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:02:56.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
