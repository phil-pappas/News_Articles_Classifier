The reason for his proposal though won't likely lead to officials in Austin returning his phone call.\nThe Austin American Statesman reported on a post on Buzbee's Facebook page on Wednesday addressing the issue, though it was out of public view in the afternoon. In it, Buzbee noted that he hasn't talked with anyone associated with Texas A&M's board of regents or football people about this, but he feels it's time the Aggies schedules the Longhorns.\n\"I am going to advocate that the Aggies play Texas again in the near future. Because of our brutal SEC West schedule, where we play the likes of Alabama, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, LSU, etc., the Aggies need some cupcake games to rest and heal. In my view, Texas is just as weak if not weaker than the non-conference games we play, so we may as well play them.\"\nTexas A&M is enjoying a 4-0 start, including an overtime win over Arkansas on Saturday for a share of the SEC lead. Texas is 1-3 following a loss to Oklahoma State, giving the Longhorns their worst start since 1956.\nThe teams last played in 2011, when Texas defeated Texas A&M, 27-25.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://www.hookem.com/2015/09/30/texas-am-regent-tony-buzbee-wants-to-schedule-texas-aggies-need-some-cupcake-games/"], "published": "2015-09-30T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:31:18.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
