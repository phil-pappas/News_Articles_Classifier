The 25th-ranked Tigers take on the 15th-ranked Ole Miss Rebels at 11 a.m. Saturday morning in front of the ABC audience. \nThe past few ABC 11 a.m. games have ranged in audience from roughly 2.5 to 4.5 million people, per sportsmediawatch.com. This is the third consecutive national TV game for the Tigers, and the first time a Memphis vs. Ole Miss game has been on a national telecast since 2003, when Eli Manning quarterbacked the Rebels. Coincidentally enough, the last Tiger football game to show up in a national non-cable game, the Tigers took on the other Manning - Peyton, in Memphis' historic win over the 6th ranked Tennessee Volunteers in 1996. \nWhile Tiger fans are excited to see their team on the national airwaves, coach Justin Fuente recognizes how important this game could be. \n\"Obviously that's another great platform to play against a fantastic football team in Ole Miss on a national stage,\" said Fuente. \"I think it's a great opportunity for us to display our university and our community.\" \nThe Memphis Tigers are 5-0 and on a school-record 12-game winning streak. The Rebels are coming off a 38-10 loss to Florida. \nCopyright 2015 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.
