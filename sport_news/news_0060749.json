Show Caption Previous Next \nTennessee senior cross country runner Chelsea Blaase finished third at the Pre-Nationals Women's 6K Red Race in Lexington, Ky., on Saturday. \nBlaase, in her final race before the SEC Championships later this month, finished the course at E.P. Tom Sawyer Park in 20 minutes, 2.6 seconds. She led briefly toward the end of the race, but Erin Clark of Colorado closed strong to win with a time of 20:00.5. \nBlaase's race started the day's action and featured many of the nation's top runners competing as individuals. \n\"Chelsea had an excellent performance,\" director of cross country Beth Alford-Sullivan said in a school release. \"She raced a perfect race strategy, she had some great moves in there and she stayed patient early on. \n\"This is a great confidence-builder, to come in here and run it right at 20 minutes and almost win the race. I'm very proud of her and excited for her future as we go.\" \nTennessee men's team took 10th place in the 8K Black Race and the women were 26th in the 6K Black Race. \nKyle Walter (24:29.4) led the way for the Vols' men with an 18th place performance, followed by Zach Long (24:49.4) in 37th. \nFor the women, freshman twins Julia and Jessica Rizor were the top two Tennessee runners. Julia (22:04.4) was 75th, and Jessica (22:06.4) finished 77th. \n\"For both the men and the women, I thought we did some things really well,\" Sullivan said. \n\"We had a great race out of Kyle Walter and a nice race out of Julia Rizor and her sister Jessica as well. ... Today we looked a little flat in my opinion, but that's okay. They got a lot from the race. I think the men ran a lot faster than they did two weeks ago and I think there's a lot of things we can build off of for the conference meet.\" \nThe SEC meet will take place Oct. 30 in College Station, Texas. \nWomen's Tennis: Three Vols advanced to the round of 16 at the USTA/ITA Ohio Valley Regional Championships in West Lafayette, Ind., but only made it to the quarterfinals. \nFreshman Sadie Hammond opened with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Nelli Ponomareva of Miami (Ohio), then defeated Aldila Sutjiadi of Kentucky 6-1, 6-3 to advance to the quarterfinals. \n\"I'm really happy about the wins I've had this tournament, and I'm even more excited to compete tomorrow for a spot in the semifinals,\" Hammond said. \nTennessee's Ashley Bongart defeated Marta Morga of Memphis 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, but fell to Kentucky's Nadia Ravita 6-3, 6-1. Eve Repic started with a 6-1, 7-6 (2), win over Krisztina Kapitany of Purdue before losing 6-2, 6-0 to Sydney Campbell of Vanderbilt. \nMen's Tennis: Tennessee duo Jack Schipanski and Igor Smelyanski advanced to the doubles semifinals at USTA/ITA Ohio Valley Regional Championships in Knoxville. \nThe Vols' new doubles pairing defeated Rogerio Ribeiro and David Biosca of East Tennessee State, 8-6, and will face Ball State's Lucas Andersen and Andrew Stutz on Sunday at 10 a.m. at Goodfriend Tennis Center. \nTennessee sophomore Luis Valero beat fifth-seeded William Bushamuka of Kentucky 6-4, 6-2 to advance to the quarterfinals, where he lost to Alex Gornet of Louisville, 6-4, 6-0.
