You don't know really how you stand, or if you're going to make it or not. After a couple of skates, though, you get some confidence out there.\"\nRookies have a short time to impress Knoxville coach Mike Craigen.\nThe Ice Bears practiced twice Wednesday, have two-a-days Thursday and Friday, and play exhibition games at home Saturday against Fayetteville and on the road Sunday against Mississippi.\nThe season opener is Oct. 23 at Macon.\nKnoxville has 28 players in camp and must trim the roster to 22 by Monday.\n\"I think what you take away from that first practice is everybody realizes what kind of opportunity is here,\" Craigen said. \"The rookies are excited to be here and have a chance to play for such a good franchise. The returning guys are excited to be part of a growing group. I think those guys are going to embrace a leadership role within that room.\"\nRookie defenseman Jake Flegel of Whitby, Ontario, sees the opportunity and challenge ahead.\nFlegel played two years at NCAA Division III power Adrian College (Mich.) and was a teammate there in 2013-14 with Cousineau.\nFlegel is one of five rookies in main camp who made the cut from last weekend's free-agent camp.\n\"It's a pro tryout, and obviously they're looking for guys to fill roster spots,\" Flegel said. \"You've got to turn that nervous energy into excitement and confidence and go from there and play well.\"\nKnoxville has had four players from Adrian College on its roster in recent years: Mike Towns, Jeremy Klaver, Andrew Dovey, and Cousineau.\nRight wing Shawn Skelly, who also played for Adrian College, signed with the Ice Bears in the offseason. Skelly started his pro career in 2011-12 and has played in the SPHL and East Coast Hockey League for four seasons.\nFlegel was aware of the pipeline from Adrian College to Knoxville.\n\"I obviously knew (Cousineau) was coming down here,\" Flegel said. \"He was a great leader on my team. He's kind of a legend at Adrian College just because of the kind of guy he is and the leader he is in the dressing room, and really a likeable guy. Obviously him coming here and Skelly is here as well, I knew I was coming into a great organization.\"\nCousineau had 19 points (nine goals, 10 assists) in 41 regular-season games last season and two points (one goal, one assist) in seven playoff games.\nHis role should expand this year.\n\"It was hard to jump right up in the top two lines here last year because we had such a deep team,\" Cousineau said. \"This year I'm looking forward to logging some more minutes and maybe a bit more power-play time, and hopefully put a few more in the net.\"\nDave Link is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:13:26.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
