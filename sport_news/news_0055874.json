Content ranged from a salary cap case study of the 2014-15 Los Angeles Kings to diving into the deep end of on-the-fly shift start data.\nA panel discussion featuring Thomas, Montreal Canadiens analyst Matt Pfeffer, Pittsburgh Penguins analyst Sam Ventura, and Hockey Prospectus’ Timo Seppa, focused on the state of hockey analytics.\nThe conversation naturally turned to the juicy stuff, specifically how analysts interact with NHL decision makers.\n“Michael Therrien doesn’t want to see statistics,” Pfeffer, 21, said of his coach. “He wants to hear my opinion based on the statistics.”\n“You have to be flexible with what you’re willing to do, and the way in which you deliver that information,” explained Pfeffer, who also works for Hockey Canada.\nLater in the day, respected analytics blogger Jennifer Lute Costella unveiled a player classification system she has been working on since February.\nAt the top of the heap is the All-Around contributor, the complete package who creates opportunities for his teammates, generates shots and suppresses opposing shots while being a pillar of the team’s structure.\nLute Costella determined the other two classifications — DIY’ers (do it yourself) and Finishers — are still valuable player types, but they don’t possess the same value as the All-Around.\nLike most of what was discussed Saturday, her research and conclusions were borne out from curiosity.\n“Is there a way that these players have value, or have skills, that don’t measure well with good shot metrics?” Lute Costella asked rhetorically during her presentation.\nGOALIE WITCHCRAFT?\n“Goalies are voodoo,” read Nick Mercadente’s introductory slide for a lecture on goaltending analytics.\nThe tongue-in-cheek phrase has been tossed around countless times over the past decade.\nAnd for good reason: Goalie is the one position analytics thinkers can’t seem to tackle.\n“They’re really frustrating to try to analyze, to even try to track,” Mercadente, who hails from Connecticut, said of netminders. “We have this huge knowledge gap.\n“Goals-against average makes no sense, whatsoever. It’s impacted by everything else going on around the ice.”\nWhile traditional save percentage is a step up from GAA, it’s not perfect.\nThat’s part of the reason why Mercadente has created a new metric — named Adjusted Goals Saved Above Average Per 60 Minutes — which he hopes can help bridge the aforementioned “knowledge gap.”\nA lawyer, former goalie and youth hockey coach, Mercadente considered three variables when developing the formula for the admittedly longwinded stat.\nFirst of all, save percentages should include data recorded only in even-strength situations. Why? Power play and penalty kill action is slanted and therefore not indicative of a goalie’s performance.\nAdjusting for shot quality is another factor. Every shot should be treated differently, and are thus divided into categories — high danger, medium danger and low danger.\nLastly, using a goalie’s games played count is an out-of-date mindset. Many modern statistics sub in hourly rates (e.g. per 60 minutes) in order to even the playing field for those who play less.\nIn practice, Mercadente’s metric calculates how much better or worse the goalie in question is in comparison to a league-average puckstopper.\n“Look at a goalie like Steve Mason,” he said. “He’s on Philly and nobody notices. Meanwhile, he had an absolutely astronomically great season. He gets no credit. He didn’t even get a vote for the Vezina (Trophy).”\nThe 2014-15 season saw Mason finish with 0.577 Adjusted Goals Saved Above Average Per 60 Minutes. He led the entire NHL in that category, according to Mercadente’s formula.\n“He’s saving over a half-goal than an average goalie would be saving in his place,” Mercadente concluded.\nVoodoo no more?\nGIVE AND GO\nAccording to information relayed in a presentation called Hockey Analytics and Performance Data, hockey players generally sustain injuries in practice at a higher rate than soccer players. For every time a hockey player gets injured in practice, a hockey player gets hurt 15-16 times in-game. With soccer players, it’s 25:1 … Bought-out contracts referenced with disdain throughout the day: Ville Leino’s six-year, $27-million deal with Buffalo; Alex Semin’s five-year, $35-million pact with Carolina … Sat beside a Division III assistant coach from Vermont. Start to his weekend: Friday night recruiting in Buffalo, Saturday analytics conference in Rochester, Saturday night recruiting in Toronto.
