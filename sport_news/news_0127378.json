Refresh often for updates once the press conference begins. Newest updates will be at the top. \n-- That's a wrap. Stay tuned for full coverage. \n-- With the guys not showing effort, Caldwell said, \"some of them weren't out there very long in the game.\" The coach says those issues are addressed immediately. \n-- Kyle Van Noy's game status was determined by DeAndre Levy's availability. The decision was based on special teams, but Caldwell still believes the young linebacker is \"still on track.\" \n-- On Josh Bynes' post-game speech, Caldwell said \"good ideas have no rank.\" He said other leaders speak constantly. \n-- Abdullah showed improvement with ball security in college and Caldwell expects to similar improvement at the professional level. \n-- Caldwell has spoken to Martha Ford since the game, but won't share details. \n-- The Ford family is unhappy. They are upset as anybody. \n-- Caldwell still believes Ameer Abdullah is going to be a good back in this league. He'll have to earn his playing time going forward, prove he can be more secure with the ball. \n-- Caldwell said he feels team gave good effort last night, but it wasn't 100 percent. He said team didn't fight through bad sequence against Arizona. \n-- No update on DeAndre Levy. The doctors will make a determination on how long he sits. \n-- Caldwell implies Stafford is pressing, which is causing his turnover issues. \n-- Caldwell said those turning it over consistently will have the ball taken out of their hands. \n-- Caldwell said team doesn't need overhaul on offense. The problem is still turnovers and penalties. If you trim those, it's much different. \n-- When a team is playing that badly, it warrants changes. Caldwell doubles down on benching Stafford. His leash in the game remains the same, \"there is no leash.\" \n-- Caldwell said Stafford is mentally tough. \n-- On Matthew Stafford, it's just one game. He's capable of straightening things out. There's time and no one is closing the door on him. \n-- The team evaluates everything, but still not making any changes with the coaching staff. \n-- Film didn't look any different than live. It was ugly. We didn't play well as capable, Caldwell says. Not very many bright spots. Overall, it was disappointing and embarrassing. Our charge is to play better. \n-- We're at five minutes past start time, still no Caldwell. \nALLEN PARK -- Join MLive.com at 12:30 p.m. for live updates from Detroit Lions coach Jim Caldwell's Monday press conference wrapping up his team's 42-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. \nIt only took five weeks and the Lions' season is over. At 0-5, the hopes of returning to the playoffs are gone. All that's left is pride and battling for future employment. Buckle up folks because we're going to be at this for three more months. \nUp next, Detroit hosts the Chicago Bears, another bad football team, but one that's managed to win two games in a row. If you think the Lions are at rock bottom now, just know it gets worse if the team falls to this Bears squad at Ford Field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:27:24.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
