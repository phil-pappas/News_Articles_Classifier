Tom Cruze for The Signal. A A A \nIt’d be fascinating, wouldn’t it, for the Grizzlies to end their 45-game Foothill League losing streak against the program that beat them 90-0 way back in 2006? \nObviously, a Canyon squad that’s looked much improved its last two times out wants nothing to do with that as these teams take the field for a 7 p.m. kickoff today at Canyon High School. \nAnd the Grizzlies (4-2 overall, 0-1 in Foothill) don’t seem to care as much about the “who” as the “when” in terms of getting that first-ever league win. \n“I want to win every game,” said Golden Valley head coach Dan Kelley. “... You want that (first league victory) every week, no matter who you’re playing.” \nGolden Valley’s first shot last Friday didn’t pan out. \nThe Grizzlies’ defense played well — holding Valencia to 13 points before halftime — but the offense managed just 38 total yards against a Vikings squad that recorded nine sacks. \nStill, Golden Valley’s versatility presents a challenge for the Cowboys (1-5, 0-1). \n“They pose a lot of difficulties as far as how many weapons they have,” said Canyon head coach Rich Gutierrez, specifically mentioning Grizzlies running back Jesse Camacho, wide receiver Julian Torres and quarterback Victor Corona. \nKelley praised Canyon’s QB, too. \nCowboys quarterback Miles Fallin had his best game, statistically speaking, last Friday. \nThe junior threw touchdown passes of 80, 13 and 72 yards to finish with 306 yards against Hart. \n“I think Miles is making strides,” Gutierrez said. “We’re a young squad — just getting in the rhythm of things is the goal.” \nCanyon has, however, gotten a little more experienced recently. Junior right tackle Timothy Huss, a 2014 All-SCV second-team selection, made his first start of 2015 against Hart after a summer shoulder injury. \nHe’s set to start again tonight. \nHart (5-1, 1-0) vs. West Ranch (3-3, 0-1) at Valencia High, 7 p.m. today \nThe trajectory was the same — at least early on. \nHart and West Ranch football both started the season red hot, with a lot of offense and two comfortable wins each. \nThe Indians’ stock has continued to trend up, punctuated by a 52-28 rout of Canyon High last week in their Foothill League opener. \nThe Wildcats’ road has been a little bumpier. \nAfter outscoring their first two opponents 95-20, the Cats have lost three of their last four, including a Foothill-opening 42-7 loss to Saugus last Friday. \nWest Ranch quarterback Jackson Clark exited that game after a first-quarter sack. He’ll miss Friday’s game due to “concussion protocol,” according to Cats head coach Jan Miller, so Wyatt Eget will make his first varsity start. \nThe junior completed 10-of-27 passes for 206 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions against Saugus in relief of Clark, who may return on Oct. 23 against Valencia, Miller said. \nWest Ranch fell behind Saugus 21-0 early and gave up 153 yards rushing to Cents QB Louis Eusebi in the game. Hart, too, has a nimble QB. \nThat quarterback, Nick Moore, ranks fourth in league with 341 yards rushing on 75 carries. \nHe did the most damage with his arm against Canyon, however, throwing for a career-high 319 yards on 24-of-36 passing. He threw two touchdowns and one interception. \nThe Cats will also have to deal with running back Nelson James, who’s coming off a career high of his own.James ran for 255 yards on 20 carries against the Cowboys — giving him a league-leading 655 yards for the year. An emerging threat for West Ranch has been jack-of-all-trades Jordan Hunt. \nThe senior returner, running back and receiving target caught a 76-yard TD from Eget against Saugus. That was his fourth touchdown reception of the year to go along with a punt return score and a kickoff return touchdown earlier in the year. \nValencia (3-3, 1-0) vs. Saugus (3-3, 1-0) at College of the Canyons, 7:30 p.m. today \nThere’s a sense in which the Vikings and Centurions have put up-and-down preleague slates behind them — completely behind them. \nThat at least appeared to be the case last Friday when the Vikings defense dominated Golden Valley in a 37-0 league-opening win, and Saugus did much the same in a 42-7 rout of West Ranch. \n“I think our kids did a great job of (focusing on) second season,” said Valencia head coach Larry Muir. “The non-league is behind you, hopefully you learned a lot of lessons from it.” \nBoth teams improved to .500 on the season last week after preleague’s that included Valencia being upset by Palmdale and a Saugus three-game losing streak. \nQuarterback play against two tough defenses may factor heavily in which team continues its turnaround. \nValencia quarterback Cole Parkinson is coming off three exceptionally efficient outings, completing more than 69 percentof his passes in each. \nHe threw for 159 yards and two touchdowns on 18 attempts against Golden Valley. \nCents QB Louis Eusebi threw for only 119 yards on 7-of-17 passing against West Ranch, but he ran for 153 yards and one touchdown, showing athleticism that Valencia is well-aware of. \n“He’s athletic. He’s smart,” Muir said of Eusebi. “He probably knows their system really well and all those things. We definitely have a big challenge ahead of us in terms of (stopping him).” \nTrinity Classical Academy (3-2) at Sherman Indian of Riverside (0-5), 7 p.m. today \nA game against an 0-5 opponent isn’t a bad way to get over a tough loss to crosstown rival SCCS. \nThe Knights are on the road tonight to face a Sherman Indian team that’s been outscored by 170 points on the season. \nThis after Trinity lost 42-18 to the Cardinals last Saturday. \nThe Knights were carried by their defense against SCCS, returning three interceptions for touchdowns. \nTheir offense, on the other hand, struggled outside of 133 combined yards rushing from Ian Caddow and Caden Kulp. \nAs a result, the Knights couldn’t build on an 18-14 halftime lead. \nThat lack of scoring may be, in part, because the Knights have still been playing without wide receiver Ryan DeMarois, who was expected to contribute in the passing game. \nDeMarois has only played half of one game due to an injury. \nSherman Indian’s defense, though, has given up an average of 44 points a game this season. So there’s reason to believe Trinity’s offense will look more like the unit that scored 50, 44 and 68 points in respective games earlier this year. \nKulp leads the Knights with 509 yards rushing on 74 carries. \nSanta Clarita Christian (5-1, 1-0 in San Joaquin) vs. The Webb Schools of Claremont (5-1, 1-0) at Canyon High, 7 p.m. Saturday \nThis may come as a surprise: The Cardinals hurt Webb most through the air last season.OK, so that could be said for nearly every game SCCS plays. It did, after all, throw the ball 57 times in a 42-18 win over \nTrinity Classical Academy last week. \nAnd it’s safe to say the Cards will stick to the script as they return to San Joaquin League play on Saturday. \nSCCS lost 55-28 to Webb last season, but SCCS’s then-senior quarterback Jonathan Saavedra threw for 436 yards on, yes, 57 attempts. \nSaavedra’s replacement, junior Tristan Miller, has put up gaudy numbers to this point. \nHis 2,085 yards passing are fifth best in the state, according to Max Preps. And his 29 touchdowns are fourth most — as are his 12 interceptions. \nHe’ll lead SCCS against a Gauls defense that’s given up more than 14 points in a game just twice this season. \n“This is one of those game that can really set the tone for making the playoffs,” said SCCS head coach Garrick Moss.Webb sits in a tie for the eighth spot in the CIF-Southern Section East Valley Division’s latest poll. \nSCCS is listed under “others” in the poll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:35:00.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
