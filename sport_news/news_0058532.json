The Washington Post has also mounted a project that monitors fatal police shootings. Both came after a number of online initiatives by researchers and citizen journalists.\nIn the past seven days, a series of comments and announcements have pushed the issue of counting police deaths back to the fore.\nUS attorney general Loretta Lynch clarified remarks on the importance of such data; FBI director James Comey conceded it was “unacceptable” that newspapers including the Guardian were becoming the “lead source” of information on such deaths; and a major new government initiative to collect records was announced.\nHere is a recap of who has said what, how the new project may be rolled out, and why it might be different from flawed official efforts in the past.\nWhat did Loretta Lynch say? Last week the US attorney general said that although the Justice Department “encouraged” local law enforcement to track police killings, improving the relationship between police and communities was more important than the federal government dictating the “minutiae of record keeping”.\n“The statistics are important but the real issues are, what steps are we all taking to connect communities ... with police and back with government?” Lynch told journalist Chuck Todd.\nOn Monday she clarified her remarks: “Let me be clear,” she said, “police shootings are not minutiae at all, and the department’s position and the administration’s position has consistently been that we need to have national, consistent data.”\nWhat did James Comey say? The FBI chief followed Lynch’s remarks on Wednesday , stating that the lack of federal data on police killings was “embarrassing and ridiculous”.\n“It is unacceptable that the Washington Post and the Guardian newspaper from the UK are becoming the lead source of information about violent encounters between police and civilians,” Comey said at a summit on violent crime, attended by the Washington Post . “That is not good for anybody.”\nThese remarks follow Comey’s continued frustration over the FBI’s inability to mandate that local law enforcement agencies report civilian deaths to federal authorities. On 28 September , he said the bureau would try to collect more data, but that it would not require it.\n“I don’t have the power to require people to supply us with data,” Comey told reporters last week .\n“So my plan is, I’m just talking about it constantly to state and local law enforcement, saying this is in everyone’s interest who cares about sound policing, sound public policy, and to use the bully pulpit of this office to say ‘You’ve got to give it to us, you’ve got to give it to us’. Those are the tools I have.”\nWhat is the Bureau of Justice Statistics doing? On Monday, Lynch announced that the Department of Justice’s data collection arm, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), would pilot a new program to collect data on law enforcement homicides. The pilot program, which the Guardian understands will be rolled out in full at the start of 2016, marks the most comprehensive official effort to date to count the number of officer-involved deaths in the US.\nLynch did not give many details on how the program would operate, but said it would use open-source records, such as news reports documenting homicides, as a starting point before BJS officials contact local law enforcement agencies for official records.\nBefore Lynch’s announcement, the Guardian was given a detailed briefing on how this system will operate. A BJS official said the agency will aim to establish reporting coordinators in each state, potentially based in the offices of state law enforcement.\nThese coordinators will aim to contact local agencies, including police, medical examiners and other criminal justice departments, on a quarterly basis for official records of cases identified by open sourcing.\nThe BJS will also consider approaching a sample of police departments around the country, where deaths have not already been identified, to ensure no case goes unrecorded.\nThis methodology is near-identical to the one employed by The Counted .\nHow will this be different from the past? This is not the first time a federal agency has endeavored to track the number of police killings in the US. The FBI has long kept track of “justifiable homicides”, but it has relied on law enforcement agencies to voluntarily report such incidents, leaving them dramatically undercounted – possibly by more than 50% .\nThese numbers exclude any person who was not considered a felon at the time of their death, as well as any unjustifiable homicides.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also keeps data on law enforcement-related deaths , via the National Violent Death Reporting System. But fewer than two-thirds of US states contribute data to this database.\nLastly, the BJS had a program to count “arrest-related deaths”. It was quietly suspended in March 2014, when it became clear it was greatly undercounting such deaths.\nUnlike all of these efforts, the new BJS program will utilize a verified open-source methodology and local news reports to populate its database, rather than depend on voluntary or incomplete reporting from law enforcement agencies.\n“It may take some time to get it out to all 50 states in 2015, but once we do that, we think we will have a standardised system in play,” the BJS official said.", "external_links": ["http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=82", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/", "http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nvdrs/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-police-shooting-data-james-comey_560d7252e4b0af3706dfd8c3", "http://killedbypolice.net/", "http://www.fatalencounters.org/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fbi-director-calls-lack-of-data-on-police-shootings-ridiculous-embarrassing/2015/10/07/c0ebaf7a-6d16-11e5-b31c-d80d62b53e28_story.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:28:27.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
