PICTURE: JUSTIN BRIERTY Source: News Limited Shredding the Cairns World Cup \nEVAN Winton will enjoy another Gravitate Mountain Bike Festival this weekend but will keep a bit in the tank for what lies ahead for the sport in the Far North. \nThe annual celebration of off-road cycling and all it entails starts tonight and will offer the perfect appetiser ahead of next weekend’s ­inaugural MTBA Enduro Championships series opener at Smithfield. \nThe famous Crocodile ­Trophy will also launch from the Smithfield trails before heading bush next Saturday to cap the mountain biking smorgasbord. \nWhile racing is competitive, Gravitate also panders to the social side of riding, suits all levels of rider and covers the entire region’s trails. EXTREME: Mountain bike rider Evan Winton gets some practice in at Smithfield mountain bike park. PICTURE: JUSTIN BRIERTY Source: News Limited \nFormer motocross rider Winton will do his best to be as involved as possible before taking home-ground advantage into the newest series on the Australian mountain biking calendar. \n“I’m not sure what I’ll ride in but I know it’s going to be a fun weekend no matter what,” the 27-year-old said. \n“I’ll be keeping one eye on the Enduro though, saving some energy for that because that’s going to be awesome.” \nCairns Mountain Bike Club president Frank Falappi said it was a good time to refocus their energy ahead of a big two years for the sport in the Far North. \n“Cairns has always been great at running events but with the (UCI MTB) World Cup back next and the World Championships, which will be twice the size, the year after, the focus of the mountain bike world will be on us for two years and we need to grab that,” he said. \n“I don’t think local councils are doing enough right now and I would love to see them meet with clubs in Atherton, Mareeba and Cairns and see what can be done to capitalise on this. \n“It’s all about getting together with your mates, riding and showcasing the region, which is what Gravitate is all about,” Mr Falappi said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:27:21.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
