Since losing their opening 34-32 defeat to the Japanese the Springboks have beaten Samoa, Scotland and the U.S.A., conceding just one try in the three games, to win Group B and set up a meeting with the Warren Gatland's Welsh side. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday (October 13) assistant coach Ricardo Loubscher said South Africa will be looking to maintain the form they have shown since the Japan match. \"It's massive for us. You look at Wales, a physical direct team, so it's vital for us to keep continuity, keep momentum.
