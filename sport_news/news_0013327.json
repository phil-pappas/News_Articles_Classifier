And he says that the university may have to lay people off if too few employees choose to leave.\nPresident Mike Fitts says in a message distributed to Tulane employees on Tuesday that details will be released Oct. 21 on the \"voluntary separation program\" for those wishing to retire or seek other jobs.\nThe move comes as the university works to trim an annual budget deficit of $15 million to $20 million.\nOther cost-cutting measures mentioned in Fitts' message include renegotiation of a university energy contract and changes in travel and health care management.\nAlso, changes in overtime, sick leave and vacation policies will take effect next July.\nFitts is entering his second year as Tulane's president.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
