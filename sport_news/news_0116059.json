His next assignment is the Pune Challenger, starting October 26 after he pulled out of the Bangalore event due to some niggles. His Davis Cup teammate Rohan Bopanna congratulated him on twitter.\n\"Congrats to @yukibhambri on getting into the singles top100. Well done yuks,\" Bopanna wrote. Not only Yuki but Saketh Myneni is also making a steady progress on the tour. He won the Vietnam Open yesterday and is now ranked 166. Somdev Devvarman though has dropped further to 181.\nIndia now have three singles players in top-200 in a rare feat for country's tennis players.\nRohan Bopanna is country's highest ranked player in doubles at number 15, followed by Leander Paes (36) and Purav Raja (96).
