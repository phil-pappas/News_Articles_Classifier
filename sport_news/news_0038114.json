The wait had been even longer for Wales, and both teams were celebrating on the pitch in Bosnia when news came through that Israel had lost. \nBosnia kept its hopes alive of reaching a playoff with the win. Milan Djuric sent a looping header over Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey in the 71st minute and the host doubled its lead in the last minute through Vedad Ibisevic. \nFor Belgium, Radja Nainggolan, Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Laurent Depoitre all scored.
