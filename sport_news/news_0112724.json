You look at the list of champions -- the list of champions is as good a list as maybe there is in golf. \n\n\"The teams that have partnered up from the Jack (Nicklaus) and Arnies (Arnold Palmer) to the Davis Love and Fred Couples -- might have a Tiger (Woods) and David Duval on there. \n\n\"It's quite impressive that list of champions. \n\n\"I think great players enjoy playing that different format, fo a team format, getting to have a partner, to have some fun with a partner and challenge some good golf courses. \n\n\"I've played the team format, I've played the individual format, I think the team format is much more fun and more alluring to the top players. \n\n\"The top players play enough stroke-play events.\" \n\nThe 2016 tournament will return to Melbourne where there will be no individual event, only two-man teams from each country playing four rounds of 'best ball' and 'alternate shot' -- the modes used in the Presidents Cup. \n\nThe highest-ranked player from each participating country has the chance to select a partner. \n\nA huge fan of Melbourne's sand-belt courses, Kuchar has toured them a number of times and was a member of the United States' victorious Presidents Cup team at Royal Melbourne in 2011. \n\nOrganisers have yet to pick a venue for the 2016 World Cup, but 37-year-old Kuchar left them in little doubt where his sympathies lay. \n\n\"I think Royal Melbourne's a fantastic golf course and it would be a great draw for the tournament,\" he said.
