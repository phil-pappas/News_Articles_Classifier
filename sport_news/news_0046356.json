It won in 5A in 2014.\nThe Wildcats, who finished with a team score of 311, seven strokes better than runner-up Monacan, qualified three golfers for the 4A state tournament.\n\"This is two in a row for us, so that's a good accomplishment,\" said Great Bridge's E.J. Whiten, who shot an even-par 72 to win the individual championship.\n\"I'm looking forward to competing in states with my teammates.\"\nWhiten beat out Monacan's Addie Parker and Billy Troiano, who both shot 76 to tie for second.\nGreat Bridge's Carter Old shot a 77 to tie for fourth with Jamestown's Triston Buckley.\nThe Wildcats' Conference 17 regular-season champion, Kendall Turner, shot a 78 to share sixth place alongside Jamestown's William Bell.\nFive golfers shot 79 to tie for eighth and qualify for the state tournament.\nWhitten birdied the par-5 seventh and par-4 10th to go 2 under par.\nA double bogey on the par-3 16th and a bogey on the par-5 17th dropped him to 1 over.\nWhiten responded with a birdie on the par-4 18th.\n\"The greens are small here - this is a tough course,\" Whiten said. \"I'm glad I was able to rebound. Overall, it was a good round.\"\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image. Buy Pilot photos here.\nLoading...
