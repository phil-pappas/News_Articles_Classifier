Ah, not your goal, Jimmy, a win. \"Sorry,\" Hayes quickly responded, \"(I) feel selfish or something.\" Hardly the case. Hayes had his first goal of the season and three assists to help the Boston Bruins beat the Colorado Avalanche 6-2 on Wednesday night in Denver and avoid their worst start in 50 years. After opening the season with three losses — all at home — the Bruins went on the road and raced out to a 5-0 lead by the second period, cruising to the victory from there. \"That's huge for our team,\" Hayes said. \"Carry the momentum.\" Hayes, a Boston native and former Boston College star, is in his first season with the Bruins after being acquired in a trade with the Florida Panthers. Kevan Miller and Hayes scored 2:22 apart in the first period, with Tyler Randell, Chris Kelly and Ryan Spooner scoring in the second. Spooner's goal with 4:28 remaining in the second ended a rough evening for Colorado goalie Semyon Varlamov, who stopped 14 of 19 shots before being relieved by Reto Berra. Miller got Boston off to a fast start when he sent a slap shot over the right shoulder of a screened Varlamov. Moments later, Hayes grabbed a rebound and pushed it in for his first goal. David Krejci added an empty-net goal for Boston with 1:29 left. For Randell, it was the first goal in the first game of his NHL career. He plans to give the puck to his parents. \"I never expected this to happen in the first game, but I'm pretty excited,\" Randell said. Bruins defenseman Tommy Cross also played in his first NHL game. He was called up from Providence of the American Hockey League on Tuesday after Joe Morrow was placed on injured reserve with the flu and played a solid game on the blue line. It was that sort of night for the Bruins. “The focus and the determination of our group was really good,” said Bruins coach Claude Julien. “We've seemed to have good starts in every game this year and that couldn't change. But what had to change was we had to extend the 20-minute game to a 60-minute game, and for the most part I was pretty happy with that.” Jonas Gustavsson started in goals for Tuukka Rask and stymied a high-powered Avalanche team that had 10 goals in two games. Gabriel Landeskog had a power-play goal and John Mitchell added another for Colorado. Rask has gotten off to a rocky start this season. He has a 4.72 goals-against average and an .846 save percentage. Those aren't very Rask-like numbers, considering he's currently third in career GAA (2.18) and tied for second in save percentage (.925) among active goaltenders with at least 50 appearances. Gustavsson attended training camp with the Bruins on a professional tryout and was signed earlier this month. The 30-year-old was limited by injuries last season with Detroit, going 3-3-1 with one shutout. His best save of the night was when he turned back Avalanche rookie Mikko Rantanen on a breakaway late in the first period. In the third period, Gustavsson turned back Landeskog twice on a play — once by using his left leg and again with his chest. \"My goal is to try to stay healthy, so I can really work on my game and try to be there for the guys when they need me,\" said Gustavsson, who finished with 20 saves. Boston was without forward Brad Marchand (concussion) and defenseman Joe Morrow, who has the flu. The team spread out the scoring with 10 different players picking up a point, including two assists by captain Zdeno Chara. With the win, the Bruins avoided some dubious history. They hadn't started 0-4 in a season since 1964-65. Now they’ll move on to Arizona for a game Saturday night and hope to build on the positive momentum.
