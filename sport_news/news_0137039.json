Edmonton snapped an eight-game losing streak against Detroit with the win.\n\"It was a good win,\" said Oilers coach Todd McLellan. \"It is one that we will bank and be proud of, but there are still areas of our game where we have to get better. We're going to be saying that in February. We need to keep plugging away.\"\nEdmonton's streak includes wins over Detroit, the Calgary Flames and the Vancouver Canucks -- teams they lost all 12 combined games to last season.\n\"Game by game we are getting better as a team,\" said Oilers goaltender Cam Talbot, who made 28 saves. \"To come up with some timely goals and Anders (Nilsson) and I have been able to come up with some big saves, it is all coming together pretty quick here like we were hoping. Hopefully we can keep it going.\"\nTomas Tatar found the back of the net for Detroit (3-3-0), which lost its third in a row.\n\"It was better than the last game, I think we battled harder and won some more battles,\" said Red Wings forward Henrik Zetterberg. \"We created a little more offense. Obviously those two quick goals hurt us. They're pretty deadly when they get the chances.\"\n\"We had two huge blowups and you can't win with big blowups,\" added Detroit head coach Jeff Blashill.\nEdmonton went up 2-0 at 6:34 of the second period as Benoit Pouliot sent McDavid in on a breakaway and he beat Mrazek with a highlight-reel deke to score his fourth goal of the season.\nThe Oilers extended the lead just 30 seconds later as the rebound from a Purcell shot went off Detroit defenseman Kyle Quincey and into the Red Wings' net.\nLetestu helped the Oilers get on the board with a power-play goal with 7:28 left in the first period. Yakupov made a perfect feed in front of the net and Letestu was able to direct the puck past Red Wings goaltender Petr Mrazek. It was Letestu's first goal with Edmonton.\nThe Oilers had 11 first period shots to Detroit's five on Talbot, who made a couple of huge glove saves on Detroit's late power play.\nDetroit cut the lead seven minutes into the third as Tatar scored on a backhand shot off a rebound.\nBoth teams return to action on Friday as the Oilers play the second game of a three-game homestand against the Washington Capitals. The Red Wings travel to Calgary to face the Flames.\nNotes: Detroit was 15-0-2 against the Oilers dating back to 2009 prior to the game. ...
