But they won't be gazing; they'll be working. \nThis fall, over one-hundred student-athletes meet daily on the Potomac for crew practice. The only public high school rowing program in D.C. has provided kids with another unique option when it comes in the world of sports. \n\"I've met some of my best friends on this team and knowing that they're gonna be there at 5:15 in the morning...it's what gets me out of bed. When I look back at my pillow and the alarm's going off, I just know they're gonna be there and ready to pull hard,\" said senior captain Sam Snedden. Woodrow Wilson rowers cruise the Potomac with an extra sense of pride this season as they celebrate three rich decades of history. \nThough Gabrial Elliott, one of Sam's younger teammates, did not necessarily envision himself in a boat as he entered high school, rowing has become an adventure he's taken by the horns. Not only has he learned how to row, the older athletes inspired other skills and habits as well. \n\"The juniors now were freshmen back in my novice year and since I was a year younger than them, they were kinda like my role models. I learned a lot of studying and homework tips from them. I saw how they worked together and focused together and it was really inspirational for me,\" said Elliott, as he brushed curly hair from his eyes. \nThe soft-spoken sophomore learned from the upperclassmen when he first entered the program. Now, he's leading them as the coxswain. That means sitting in the stern of the boat, directing his fellow rowers through a microphone headset. \n\"The coxswain's role in the boat is really a motivator, a leader...somebody who is gonna call everybody out on there technique,\" said mens assistant varsity coach, Catherine Gellatley. \"Generally, they're the smallest person in the boat so we call it the 'Napoleon Complex,\" she added, chuckling. \"Getting big guys to do what they want to do is a cool experience to see them grow and really become leaders on their team, especially when they might not be able to thrive in some other type of sport. So if they play soccer, they may be the kid that gets kicked around but here, they're this really powerful leader.\" \nThough Gabrial goes about his leadership role with a calm, cool and collected demeanor, perhaps one of the people most proud of his involvement is a Tiger who also rowed the Potomac years ago. \n\"My mom rowed for Wilson crew I think for her entire high school years. She told me just to go to the informational and sew what it was like and so I did and I really thought it was cool and from then on, I fell in love with it...I thought it was really awesome.\" \nWoodrow Wilson crew team in the 1980s.

Head Coach Matt Grau says the program is only growing. \n\"The program is quickly becoming really competitive. We're really stepping up the size, the equipment, and in our thirtieth year, we're hoping that we're kind of rounding into one of our better years.\" \nWoodrow Wilson crew team of 1980s gathers for a group huddle.
