One fellow in Cubs cap and jacket, a regular reader from far off Kankakee, recognized me and struck up some pleasant conversation. To get home, he had to take two trains and arrive sometime around 2 a.m., and think sad thoughts all the way.\n\"You're a Sox fan,\" he said. \"Are you going to gloat?\"\nGloat? Who, me?\nNo, I said. And I meant it.\nThat loss Tuesday left the Cubs a game away from elimination, and Wednesday's result closed up Wrigley for the winter.\nI won't gloat about the Cubs, who are a great young team, or their fans.\nThere are many true baseball fans among the Cubs faithful, like the fellow from Kankakee, and that's why I hadn't planned on any unprovoked gloating.\nThere is of course, provoked gloating, which is far different.\nSome of the Cubs fans who went psycho on sports talk radio were provocative indeed, and deserve a couple plates of gloat stew. They provoke the Sox fan in me.\nMets sweep Cubs with 8-3 Game 4 victory Colleen Kane The Cubs’ bid for their first World Series berth since 1945 sputtered to an end Wednesday night with an 8-3 loss to the Mets in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series at Wrigley Field.

The Mets swept the Cubs to advance to the World Series to play the winner of the American League Championship... (Colleen Kane) Another unnecessary provoker, sad to say, is esteemed Tribune baseball writer Paul Sullivan, who must consider himself some kind of Witch Hunter of Wrigley. Because, before Wednesday night's game, Sully tweeted:\n\"My sole assignment tonight is to keep @John_Kass out of Wrigley Field. Wish me luck.\"\nReally, Dr. Van Helsing? If that's not a gratuitous gloat-provoking tweet, what is? Sullivan's tweet guaranteed I'd be at the Friendly Confines, so you can blame Paul.\nUntil then, my plan was to make up tiny signs that said \"No Gloating Zone,\" and pass them out to all five or six Sox fans at Wrigley, so we might stick them to our big fat foreheads and try to shore up our Cubs fan friends.\nMy brothers Pete and Nick are Cubs fans. I have other friends who are Cubs fans. And at Wrigley this week, I've met many nice, warm Cubs fans who said hello and love their team. They don't deserve any gloating.\nOnly a few shouted \"Get the (bleep) out of here Kass!!\" and \"Shut up Sox fan! (Bleeper)!\" but I closed my eyes and believed that they were smiling.\nNuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune Fans try to rally the Cubs before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Fans try to rally the Cubs before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. (Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) They're right of course, Sullivan too. I shouldn't have been there, and wouldn't have been, if I weren't working. I am a Sox fan and I won't change. So I won't clap or warble \"Go Cubs Go\" in the voice of a folk singer. But I've publicly wished the Cubs well and tried to convince the organization how to remove the Mati, or evil eye upon them.\nDid the Cubs listen or even ask me how to make tasty baby goat-broth soup?\nNo.\nBut temptation abounds in the gloating world, and you can find it, win or lose, on sports talk radio. If you're a Cubs fan you shouldn't listen. If you're a Sox fan, love thy neighbor and try to resist the urge.\nIt can be difficult to resist, with some Cubs fans whining, shouting conspiracy theories, and the pouting, the crying, the defensiveness and paranoia, it sounds exactly like Hillary Clinton and her media meat puppets before a Benghazi hearing.\nSports talk was full of such unhinged folk, seeking therapy, as if they were calling the Dr. Ruth on the Cubs Erectile Bat Dysfunction Show. One caller, typical of many, said something like:\n\"Rizzo isn't hitting and Schwarber made that error in left field, so next year, we've got to put Schwarber at first and trade Rizzo!!!\"\nStunned Host: Trade Rizzo, the leader of the team?\n\"Yeah, trade Rizzo!! We've got to do something! Anything!!!!\"\nHere's what you do. Watch baseball and trust in the Chicago sports media, who, in their role as the Cubs Ministry of Thought, offer wisdom:\nThey tell us that this young team is a year ahead of schedule, that this year's playoff pressure will help forge them into a ballclub that will be a force in the league for the next five or six years at least. And I believe them.\nAlso, the Cubs have a manager who likes magicians and makes references to pounding sides of beef a la \"Rocky.\"\nWho among Cubs fans wouldn't want to hit some beef right about now? Years ago, when Sylvester Stallone hit the beef, my brothers and I would do the same in our meat cooler at our South Side supermarket.\nOne day my father opened the door.\n\"Don't punch the beef!\" he said. \"We sell the beef. Don't hit it, dammit!\"\nBut in his accent, it sounded more like, \"Don heet eeet! Dammit-eh!\" And our beef punching days were done.\nSo unless you're a wealthy Cubs fan with a fridge big enough to hold a side of beef — and ample foot room to work it like a heavy bag — I'd recommend leaving the beef hitting to professionals.\nInstead, watch some baseball. If you're a true fan, Cubs or Sox, you'll keep watching.\njskass@tribpub.com\nTwitter @John_Kass\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs Chicago White Sox Wrigley Field Commentary Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56285b17/turbine/ct-cubs-no-gloating-kass-met-1022-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627eaa6/turbine/ct-cubs-mets-wrigley-field-nlcs-live-blog", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56285b3c/turbine/ct-ct-cubs-fans-believe-2-jpg-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:08:15.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
