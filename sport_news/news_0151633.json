He felt his two-way play was pretty decent, too, despite his minus-2 plus-minus rating. \nOn Monday morning, Gagner was floored being told in a meeting with head coach Dave Hakstol that he'll be a healthy scratch for Thursday night's season opener at Tampa Bay. \nA few days earlier, Hakstol had a similar conversation with veteran forward Vinny Lecavalier, who is back in the same position that he frequently was last season under former Flyers coach Craig Berube. \nLecavalier falling out of favor with Hakstol was expected given his role last season, but Gagner being benched was the second shocker of the news, veteran defenseman Andrew MacDonald being waived as the final cut the other. \n\"I'm surprised,\" said Gagner, who was traded from Arizona to the Flyers last June for defenseman Nicklas Grossmann, Chris Pronger's contract and a conditional draft pick. \"I felt like I played solid in the preseason and got better as it went on. I thought I did enough in camp to warrant a spot in the lineup, but those decisions aren't up to me.\" \nALSO: Flyers pull shocker, waive Andrew MacDonald for final cut \nLecavalier seemed more disgusted than disappointed during his post-practice interview. After being scratched for the first 17 times of his storied career last season, he felt like he played well in the preseason despite scoring one goal, no assists and being a minus-2 in six games. \n\"Honestly, it really doesn't matter what I think,\" Lecavalier said. \"It is what it is, so I'm still going to work hard and be there for my teammates just like I did last year.\" \nGagner frequently played on the Flyers' second line in the preseason, but 21-year-old center Scott Laughton making the season-opener roster led to his opening-night benching. \nThe Flyers plan to open with Sean Couturier centering Wayne Simmonds and Brayden Schenn on their second line with Laughton centering R.J. Umberger and Matt Read on the third line. \nThe Flyers' other two lines are carryovers from last season — Claude Giroux centering Jakub Voracek and Michael Raffl on the first, Pierre-Edouard Bellemare centering Ryan White and Chris VandeVelde on the fourth. \n\"We've really looked at it and tried to build four lines that we think make sense,\" Hakstol said. \"That's not a negative to those two guys and their efforts. Nothing is written in stone.\" \nGagner, who scored 15 goals and 41 points in 81 games for Arizona last season, will be benched for just the third time in his seven-year NHL career. \n\"I'm going to stay confident and stay ready,\" he said. \nLecavalier vows to do the same, but he could be sitting a lot this season and beyond, as he's still only beginning year three of an untradeable five-year, $22.5 million contract that carries a $4.5 million cap hit. \nAsked if he wants out, Lecavalier said, \"I don't want to comment on that. Obviously, I want to play, so I don't really know if I need to say anything.\" \nRandy Miller may be reached at rmiller@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @RandyJMiller .
