(Photo: Jordan Kartholl/The Star Press, Jordan Kartholl/The Star Press) Buy Photo \nMUNCIE — Grant Zgunda had a simple message for his Delta Eagles after running into the well-oiled machine that is the top-ranked New Palestine Dragons. \n\"We're going to put that one in the trash can,\" the Delta coach said. \nThat's probably for the best with the postseason starting next week, though there was plenty to like for the Eagles a 66-29 loss in Hoosier Heritage Conference play, snapping their five-game winning streak. \nDelta running back Zach Mills unofficially broke the Eagles' single-season rushing record as he ran for 167 yards on 22 carries, including a 63-yard touchdown on his final carry of the evening. And with New Palestine — which won its 24th straight game overall and wrapped up its third consecutive unbeaten regular season — stacking the box with eight or even nine defenders, wide receiver Mitchell Hahn went crazy on the outside, hauling in six passes for 222 yards and two touchdowns. \nGreenfield-Central, which is also Delta's sectional opponent next week, had been the only team to score 20 on the Dragons. \n\"Offensively, that's the best anyone has played them,\" Zgunda said, We actually moved the ball on them. You watched the game, and it didn't look very good, but that tells you how good they are. We moved the ball like no one has against them. We had some opportunities, especially early in the game.\" \nDelta fell behind 21-0 and trailed 49-14 at halftime. \nRiley Pease was 7 of 25 passing for 165 yards and a touchdown while Tanner Lambert was 2 of 4 for 108 yards, each utilizing the 6-foot-6 Hahn's size advantage. Fullback Logan Clawson added a 7-yard scoring run for the Eagles. Pease was injured while serving as the lead blocker on a two-point conversion try in the third quarter and did not return. He was helped off the field with a leg injury though Zgunda was optimistic about his availability for next week. \nThe Eagles enter the postseason a confident bunch — lopsided loss Friday aside — after winning five straight games following two one-point losses early in the season. \n\"We could be 8-1 real easily right now, which is insane because we didn't have many people back from last year. I'm proud of them, but we're going to keep them going in the direction we need to go.\" \nContact sports features writer Ryan O’Gara at (765) 213-5829. Follow him on Twitter @RyanOGaraTSP .
