He became just the second rookie since 2000 to record that triple.\nThe 49ers intercepted Wilson twice. He completed 18 of his 24 attempts.\nSEAHAWKS DOMINATE\nRunning back Lynch, who vomited on the sidelines late in the first quarter and sat out about 11 minutes, had a game- and season-high 122 rushing yards on 27 carries.\nHis touchdown came on a one-yard dive at the end of Seattle's first possession of the game.\nHauschka's field goals came in the second quarter, a 49-yarder, and the fourth quarter, a 46-yarder.\nThe Seahawks outgained the 49ers 411-148 yards in the game.\nPhil Dawson provided the 49ers' scoring with a 35-yard field goal late in the third quarter.\nKaepernick was able to get off just 24 passes, completing 13 for 124 yards. He was not intercepted.\nRunning back Carlos Hyde had 40 yards on 11 carries for the 49ers, who have lost five of their last six games.\nTight end Vernon Davis caught four passes for 61 yards to lead 49ers receivers.\nWilson's bomb to Lockett that increased the Seahawks' lead to 17-0 with 2:44 left in the second quarter.\nWilson earlier connected with wide receiver Jermaine Kearse for 21 yards to ignite the five-play, 90-yard drive that took just 2:57.\n(Compiled by Peter Rutherford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:41:00.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
