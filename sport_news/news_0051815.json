The first-year head coach watched as his Mark Twain High School football Tigers defeated South Callaway, 18-7, on the road Friday, pushing their undefeated record to 8-0 and their Eastern Missouri Conference mark to 6-0. The victory gave the Tigers their first EMC title in just their second season in the league. It was also MTHS' first outright conference championship since being co-champions in 1969. “I'm very proud of all the work that they've put in,” Asbury said of his team. “They've put forth all the effort to achieve this and it's something they should be proud of.” The Tigers were fueled by healthy senior running back Tyler Elledge, who erupted for 299 yards and three touchdowns after being limited with side effects of a dislocated shoulder in recent weeks. Asbury said he was happy to see Elledge return to his dominant self on the field. “Tyler is a tough runner, and he really gutted through some things even though he may have been hurting a little bit,” Asbury said. “I didn't realize he had so many yards until I got the stats. We were physical, they were physical … it was a grind.” Mark Twain totaled 346 total rushing yards. Ryan Bailey had nine tackles to lead the Tigers, Walker Sharp had eight, and Bradyn Hooley had an interception. Palmyra drops second straight in shutout loss: Palmyra suffered its first shutout and first losing streak of the season on Friday, falling to Brookfield 20-0 in Palmyra. The Panthers (6-2, 4-2) sputtered on offense for the second straight week after being stalled in a 7-6 loss to Centralia in week seven. Against Brookfield, Palmyra managed just 160 yards of total offense. Senior running back Travis Harvey, the Panthers' top rusher, missed the contest with a sprained ankle suffered against Centralia. With Harvey out, PHS head coach Kevin Miles opted to change up his offense, shifting from its usual run-heavy attack to a pass-heavy offense. Panthers senior quarterback Ben Cheffey threw the ball a season-high 32 times, but completed just nine of those attempts for 83 yards. Brookfield totaled 318 yards of offense. A pair of touchdown runs had the Bulldogs ahead 13-0 before Cheffey threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown with zeroes on the game clock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:13:08.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
