(AP) - New York state environmental officials are urging cave explorers to steer clear of bat hibernation sites this winter.\nThey are concerned about white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that sickens and kills little brown bats. The state Department of Environmental Conservation says white-nose syndrome has killed more than 90 percent of bats at most hibernation sites in New York.\nHumans can potentially spread the fungus if it attaches to clothing and caving gear. State officials add that white-nose syndrome makes bats highly susceptible to disturbances that can imperil their health.\nOfficials are asking explorers to respect notices restricting the use of caves and mines. And they say cavers who come across hibernating bats should leave the area as quickly and quietly as possible.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:10:35.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
