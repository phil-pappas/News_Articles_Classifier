Buy Now Tyler Dahlgren \nFort Calhoun's Skylar Wear scores her team a point with a precision spike in the Pioneers' win on Monday night. Buy Now Tyler Dahlgren \nSarah Johnson and her Pioneer teammates gave Brownell-Talbot trouble at the net in a sweep on Monday night. \nFort Calhoun had Brownell-Talbot reeling before the first serve on Monday night in the Dundee district of midtown Omaha. \nThe Raiders, who came into the game 4-15, stood wide-eyed minutes before the opening set as the Pioneers' tall and athletic front line hammered down warmup kill after warmup kill. \nTheir precision accuracy and sharpness in pregame was a precursor to what the Pioneers' had in store for Brownell-Talbot, as they proceeded to dominate every facet of the game in a convincing sweep that took about 50 minutes to carry out. \n“We were very consistent with our passing and everybody was disciplined and in the right spot,” Slie said of his team's 25-14, 25-11, 25-7 sweep. “Big day out of Rylee Marshall in the middle and Ashlyn Dipple was consistent with her setting. My libero, Dacie Boudle, did a great job too.” \nThe Pioneers are talented. They've been talented since the beginning of the season, but now they're figuring out a new style of play under Slie and starting to grasp court spacing and positioning, which in turn has made them dangerous. \n“We've worked really hard this year on learning to be in the right spot,” Slie said. “They are finally figuring that out and when we pass the ball effectively we are tough to stop.” \nBoth Marshall and senior Grace Whitlaw finished the match with 10 kills apiece, often in powerful fashion as the Pioneers owned the air above the net. Skylar Wear led the way with four service aces while Sarah Johnson added three, all in the decisive third set. \n“We were very disciplined at the net and they were hitting the ball down like they're supposed to,” Slie said. \nFort Calhoun has now won five matches in a row and sits at 11-12. They've well eclipsed last season's win total, but don't want to rest on those laurels. Slie said his team is putting their best volleyball on the court at the right time, just as the postseason approaches. \n“I told them tonight was a big win for them so they can go into the conference tournament strong.” \nFort Calhoun 3 Brownell-Talbot 0 \nFort Calhoun (11-12) 25 25 25 3 \nBrownell Talbot (4-16) 14 11 7 0 ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:59:17.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
