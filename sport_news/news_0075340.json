He had 13 tackles, including two sacks and three tackles for loss, and forced a fumble in the fourth quarter that Jordan Evans returned 41 yards for a touchdown.\n\"I thought we had a good week of practice and I thought you could see it in everybody's eyes,\" Striker said. \"We really wanted to do good, and everybody wanted a piece of them (the Mountaineers).\"\nJordan Thomas intercepted two passes and Evans had nine tackles for the Sooners (4-0, 1-0 Big 12).\nOklahoma had forced just two turnovers before Saturday's game.\n\"We needed to come out today and be tough, be more physical and be the better team, especially on defense to get turnovers,\" Striker said. \"That was one thing we were emphasizing in practice all week.\"\nSkyler Howard threw three interceptions and lost two fumbles for the Mountaineers (3-1, 0-1), who had committed just two turnovers in their first three games.\nBaker Mayfield passed for 320 yards and three touchdowns, Dede Westbrook caught five passes for 107 yards and Durron Neal added 87 yards receiving for the Sooners.\nThe chippy contest featured a combined 245 yards in penalties. During pregame warmups, players from both teams were seen jawing at each other. It did not sit well with the home team.\n\"They came in, and it was really disrespectful and I really didn't approve of it,\" Westbrook said. \"You don't come into someone's house and disrespect us the way that they did. And we pretty much showed them with our game.\"\nThe Mountaineers came in with the nation's top-ranked scoring defense, surrendering just 7.7 points per game. Mark Andrews' touchdown in the first quarter were the first points WVU allowed in the first half of a game this season.\nOklahoma 44, West Virginia 24: Complete coverage\nBox score\nDiscuss this and the Big 12 with Chuck Carlton on Thursday; ask questions now.\nClick here to visit the Oklahoma Sooners page\nFive thoughts: Sooners' defense comes up big; where was running game?\nPhotos: Undefeated Oklahoma tunes up for Texas by leaving West Virginia in wake\nOklahoma forces five turnovers in win over West Virginia\nCarlton: Unbeaten Oklahoma rolls into Cotton Bowl, as Texas staggers along\nOklahoma quotable: Bob Stoops on Sooners creating turnovers, facing Longhorns", "external_links": ["http://d-news.co/SYNiW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/oklahoma-sooners", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/10/03/photos-undefeated-oklahoma-tunes-texas-leaving-west-virginia-wake", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/texas-rangers/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/carlton-unbeaten-oklahoma-rolls-cotton-bowl-astexas-staggers-along", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/oklahoma-forces-five-turnovers-win-west-virginia", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-oklahoma-sooners-defense-comes-big-win-west-virginia-running-game", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/oklahoma-quotable-bob-stoops-sooners-creating-turnovers-facing-texas-longhorns-next-week", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030024&home=24&vis=17&final=true"], "published": "2015-10-04T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:48:58.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
