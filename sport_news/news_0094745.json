By JOHN ZENORAP Sports Writer \nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) - Derrick Henry and Alabama only dominated the last few minutes, when their national championship hopes were hanging by a thread. \nIt was just enough. Henry scored on a 14-yard run with 2:24 left and the eighth-ranked Crimson Tide held on for a 19-14 victory over Tennessee on Saturday with an overpowering finish in a game that was surprisingly close most of the way. \nIt sets up a showdown with No. 5 LSU in two weeks at Bryant-Denny Stadium, where Alabama (7-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) has been at its most vulnerable. \nHenry was barely touched on his second touchdown of the game. Then it was the defense's turn. \nAlabama recorded two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Joshua Dobbs to preserve the win. \nThe Tide got plenty of help, with Tennessee (3-4, 1-3) missing three long field goal attempts. \nThe Volunteers took the lead on Jalen Hurd's 12-yard scoring run with 5:49 left. Alabama overwhelmed the 15-point underdogs from there. \nQuarterback Jake Coker moved Alabama downfield thanks to athletic catches by ArDarius Stewart and Calvin Ridley. Ridley made a leaping grab for a 15-yarder on third and 6 from the Vols' 40. \nThen Coker turned it over to Henry, who continued a hot streak with 28 carries for 143 yards. \nDobbs and Tennessee managed a first down before the sacks. Anderson jarred the ball loose and A'Shawn Robinson recovered it one-handed on the second one and rambled a few yards toward the end zone before getting toppled. \nCoker finished 21 of 27 for 247 yards with an interception. Stewart had six catches for 114 yards. \nDobbs was 13 of 22 for 171 yards and a touchdown. Hurd gained 92 yards on 18 carries. \nBoth quarterbacks were sacked five times. \nAlabama has won the last nine meetings, and the Vols have dropped 24 straight against Top 10 teams. \nThis one was anything but a mismatch in the long-running rivalry. \nTennessee kicker Aaron Medley missed a 43-yard attempt and two 51-yarders, one on the final play of the first half and the other early in the fourth quarter. \nWith the game tied 7-all, the Tide opened the second half with a 12-play drive but Tennessee's Cameron Sutton broke up a third-down pass in the end zone, forcing a 19-yard Adam Griffith field goal. Griffith also made a 28-yarder with 7:08 left. \nIt was the latest slow start at Bryant-Denny. Alabama has trailed at the half against Arkansas and Mississippi in its other SEC home games while looking dominant on the road. \nThe Vols wound up with their fourth loss by a touchdown or less. \nTennessee started two freshmen on the offensive line, right guard Jack Jones and right tackle Chance Hall. \nAlabama wore No. 28 stickers on their helmets honoring former teammate Altee Tenpenny, who died in a car accident on Tuesday. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:48:20.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
