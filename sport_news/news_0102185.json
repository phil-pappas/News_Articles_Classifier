Unlocking the value of these assets can have a transformative impact on productivity,” he said.\n“The Opposition’s focus on the sharing economy reinforces the view that access to assets, not ownership, is the priority.\n“The majority of companies operating in the sharing economy are Australian companies and pay their tax in Australia. We look forward to a level playing field that no longer favours multinationals with sophisticated tax shifting structures.\n“What’s missing from the Opposition’s policy is how they will bring sharing economy principles to government owned assets. As a large owner of assets, government can unlock enormous savings and efficiencies.”\nStart-up Airtasker’s co-founder and CEO Tim Fung said Airtasker was keen to hear how the Coalition replies to Labor’s principles.\n“We haven’t yet heard the Liberal Party address the sharing economy - which is making headlines in Australia and is even a campaign issue in the US election,” he said.\n“Beyond a policy framework, the next step for this trend is to accurately gauge sharing economy growth in Australia.”\nLabor’s plan for the sharing economy\n1. Rules and regulations must apply\n2. Wages and working conditions must be at least equivalent to the prevailing industry standard\n3. Everyone must pay their fair share of tax\n4. Proper protection must exist through insurance and consumer law\n5. Access for all including Australians with disabilities\n6.
