They're a great team. You've got tip your hat to them.\" \n\"It's a fantastic experience,\" Northwestern junior goalkeeper Kyle Bellhorn said. \"You've got to give credit to Moravian. They played absolutely fantastic tonight. They are one of the best opponents, if not the best opponent we will play this season. For us to come out here and show what we have both offensively and defensively as a team is absolutely fantastic.\" \nThe Tigers jumped out in the lead 10 minutes into the game, getting a goal from junior defender Jonathan Blaine off a corner kick delivered by senior midfielder Brett Scott . \n\"Credit to Moravian, they are a great team,\" Blaine said. \"Defending state champs and they always play us tough. We got them earlier in the season and to get another win against them is amazing.\" \nNorthwestern also posted a 3-0 road win over Moravian Academy on Oct. 5. \nThe Tigers' last Colonial League crown also was won against the Lions in another hard-fought game. \n\"We won two years ago, coincidentally also against Moravian. One-goal game in overtime,\" Hunsicker said. \"We had a fantastic finish in that game as well. Always just seems to be one for the ages every time we meet up in the championship game. It's a little extra special.\" \nBellhorn finished with 10 saves and was able stave off plenty of Lions chances throughout the night. \n\"I just feel that we have a bigger presence defensively,\" Bellhorn said about how the Tigers match up against Moravian Academy. \"Don't get me wrong, Tanner (Shane) in the back is absolutely fantastic, one of the best center backs in the league. And Peyton (Joseph) in net is fantastic. But it's just one of those things where we play and we have the better desire. We play well as a team. And that extra adrenaline and desire as a team is what I think gets us over the hurdle because we are equal in skill.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:08:52.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
