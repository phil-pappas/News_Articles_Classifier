(Photo: CRAIG RUBADOUX) \nDaniela Iacobelli is heading back to the LPGA Tour and admits this time feels different. \nThe Melbourne resident finished fourth in the Symetra Tour standings, qualifying her for her Tour card and a return to the top of the sport. \n“This one feels a little bit sweeter because it was the main goal and it has been accomplished,” said Iacobelli. “I think this one has a little better feeling with me.” \nIn 2012 Iacobelli earned her LPGA Tour card when she won the Daytona Beach Invitational to move into the top 10. \n“The first time was more of a surprise. You always go into a tournament wanting to win and thinking you can win. The first time my only chance of getting a card was to win and when I did that I think I was kind of ill prepared … the shock of winning your first professional event and then all of a sudden you are on the LPGA Tour,” Iacobelli said. “This year I have been playing so consistently that it was an attainable goal all year. So I was more prepared for it to happen whereas the last time it snuck up on me.” \nIacobelli made 15 starts on the LPGA Tour in 2013 with her best finish coming at the RR Donnelley Founds Cup, a tie for 29th. She did not finish the season well enough to keep her card but gets a second chance now. \n“It’s a good feeling,” Iacobelli said. “I feel like it was a good year’s work of grinding it out and accomplishing a goal I set at the beginning of the year. It feels good to have it pay off.” \nAnd she is rewarding herself with a couple days of relaxation poolside down in South Florida before getting right back to work. \nThe Florida Tech Hall of Famer plans to spend the offseason at home, working on her game at both Baytree National and Suntree Country Club. \nAnd she is going to break everything down. \n“I will start from square one, with the basics - grip, alignment and stance. Then start zeroing in on targets, distance control, chipping, putting,” Iacobelli said. “You can look at the top 100 on the money list and they are all within two shots of each other on the scoring list. The numbers speak for themselves and I think I have a better understanding of what I need to do, what I need to focus on so I am looking forward to breaking everything down and trying to fine tune every aspect of my game.” \nAnd that is one of the biggest differences in Iacobelli this time. \n“This year I took things a lot more seriously and I have an accumulation of all my stats and have looked at numbers, compared them to LPGA and PGA stats and there are quite a few things I want to get better at and more consistent with,” Iacobelli said. \nThe 27-year-old also now knows what it takes to play on the LPGA Tour and feels more comfortable this time. \n“I am just excited to get back out there. I have a decent understanding of scheduling and how that tour functions. The first time you go in a little blind and you don’t know how to schedule yourself and exhaustion happens quickly,” Iacobelli said. “So I know that time management is going to be a huge part of 2016 for myself, but I am actually looking forward to going and seeing everybody again all those friends that I made and haven’t really seen everybody in a couple of years.” \nThis time she goes into it feeling a lot more prepared for the task ahead.
