The caffeine comes from green-coffee extract that is mixed into the household-staple, he said.\nOn that fateful day when peanut butter and caffeine were combined, Pettazzoni and his business partners, Keith Barnofski and Andrew Brach, were actually brainstorming hangover cures.\n“The unsaturated fats actually create bonds with the caffeine so the digestion process is slower and results in a steady release of energy,” Pettazzoni said.\nThe company has been in business only since the spring of last year, but is already being sold at 13 locations across New England, and online for $4.99 a jar. Steem’s next tasting event will be at the Boston Veg Food Fest on October 24 and 25 .\n“It’s exciting because you have this thing that no one else has created before,” Pettazzoni said. “But when you first go out there people don't know what to make of it until they try it. Then they realize it doesn't taste strange, and then we have a fan for life.”", "external_links": ["http://steempb.com/", "http://www.bostonveg.org/foodfest/index.html"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:23:11.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
