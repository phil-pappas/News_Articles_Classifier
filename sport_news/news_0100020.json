The joy of victory can be overrun by loss before anybody really knows the celebration has ended.\nI’m not saying the 2015 Cubs are toast just because they’re down 2-0 to the Mets in the National League Championship Series. But according to a math expert Quote: d Monday in the New York Times, the Mets’ chances of winning the series are 63 percent. That means the Cubs’ chances are 37 percent, slightly more than a third.\nIn other words, say that you have three pigs in a pen and that two are pink and one is spotted. What are the chances the spotted one — all things being equal, such as wanderlust, hunger, snout size, etc. — will be the first one out of the pen if you leave the gate open? And how much would you bet on that possibility?\nYes, the Cubs are back at Wrigley Field for what they hope will be three consecutive games in this best-of-seven series, and that means a lot. And, no, a sporting event isn’t as dumb as a pig (except when owners are at the trough).\nBut this moment as an underdog clearly isn’t the high point for the Cubs in what has been a magical season that already has brought fans 101 victories.\nThe baseball peak for our Cubbies most likely has been hit. But before we get to when that that speculative moment hit — I see it as being similar to explorers on K2, looking out at the universe, never realizing Mount Everest is a tad taller — let’s talk about what has gone wrong here at the end.\nMaybe this team was built for summertime.\nThat’s a weird thing to say, but Cubs pitchers don’t seem to be aces when it’s cold and Cubs bats are nearly petrified (three runs in two NLCS games) in mid-October. Yes, it was frigid for Games 1 and 2 at Citi Field, but did Cubs players (and a few Mets) really have to come out in gear that made it look like the Ice Bowl in Green Bay on Dec. 31, 1967?\nJorge Soler apparently is so cold that, should he venture onto the field, shivering with hypothermia, he ought to be outfitted in a hazmat suit, with multiple sheepskins underneath and an astronaut helmet on his ice-cube noggin. Soler says he hates the cold. We believe him. Because his batting average when the temperature is below 50 degrees stinks.\nDoes that mean president Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer should be leery of Cuban-born players if the World Series is on their minds, which it should be? No. Cuban-born guys such as Tony Perez, Mike Cuellar and Luis Tiant did OK up in the northern latitudes and even won a few World Series.\nThe problems are really that baseball is a precise game that can turn on so many random events that prediction — for single games, anyway — is silly.\nIn that New York Times piece, Dr. Bruce G. Bukiet, a baseball devotee and professor of mathematical sciences at the New Jersey Institute of Technology — a dude who did postdoctoral fellowship work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, a serious place where the Manhattan Project was concocted — stated: ‘‘Anything can happen in one game.’’\nThere you have it. And Cubs manager Joe Maddon says all he looks for are ‘‘one-game winning streaks.’’\nBut if there was a peak already, I’m suggesting it was 22-year-old Kyle Schwarber’s home run in the seventh inning of the Cubs’ 6-4 victory against the Cardinals that clinched the NL Division Series last Tuesday at Wrigley.\nThat ball landed atop the video board in right field and promptly was encased in plexiglass by Cubs management, an icon rivaling an arrow shot by Robin Hood through the heart of some bad guy in Nottingham Forest.\nThe celebration after that blast was something to behold. The joy was manifest. For not only was it a mighty blast, but young Schwarber actually told teammate Dexter Fowler he was going to hit a home run right then. A called shot! Under glass! The Schwar-board!\nIt’s not like a black cat, a goat or even a missed foul ball in Cubs lore. It was a beautiful thing. But it might have been a marker, a high point, a peak.\nAnd we never even knew it.\nFollow me on Twitter @ricktelander.\nEmail: rtelander@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:07:53.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
