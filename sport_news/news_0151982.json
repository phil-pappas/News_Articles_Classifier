(AP Photo/Bob Leverone, File) Comments \nDrew Brees is expected to start at quarterback for the New Orleans Saints Sunday night against the Dallas Cowboys, head coach Sean Payton said Friday. \nBrees missed last week's game — a 27-22 loss at Carolina — due to a bruised rotator cuff in his throwing shoulder. However, he has been throwing in practice without difficulty all week, and has been cleared for Sunday. \n\"I think he's planning on it, and I think we're planning on starting him based on the workweek and the reps,\" Payton said, via ESPN . \"He's thrown well. I thought he looked sharp today.\" \nLast week marked the first time Brees had missed a game due to injury in his 10 seasons with the Saints. In fact, he said he had not sat out a game for health reasons since his junior year of high school 20 years ago. \nVeteran Luke McCown started in Brees' place last week, completing 31 of 38 passes for 310 yards. He was the first player other than Brees to start at quarterback for the Saints since Mark Brunell started the final game of the 2009 regular season, when Brees was a healthy scratch after New Orleans had clinched homefield advantage in the playoffs. \nBrees was officially listed as \"probable\" on the Saints' injury report released Friday afternoon. Payton said Brees has been throwing all week and \"looks good.\" \n\"Each day you just pay attention to how he's functioning,\" Payton said. \"He looked crisp today. So I think he's gonna end up starting. Based on the way the week unfolded, each day I felt like he has made the progress we were looking for. Deep balls and all that stuff. So it was good.\" \nThe Saints are 0-3 and have lost six straight home games dating back to last season. Starting quarterback Tony Romo remains out for Dallas (2-1) with a broken collarbone, with Brandon Weeden again expected to start. \nAlso listed as \"probable\" Friday were Saints cornerback Keenan Lewis (hip) and safety Jairus Byrd (knee), both of whom had missed all three games this season. Guard Jahri Evans (knee) remains out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:01:02.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
