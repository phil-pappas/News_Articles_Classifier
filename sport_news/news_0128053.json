The ball bounded into the end zone and went over the back line for a touchback and Seattle's ball at the 20. \nRussell Wilson was sacked six times and pulled numerous escape acts, but threw a TD pass to Doug Baldwin in the first half and Steven Hauschka hit a pair of field goals from 50-plus yards as Seattle evened its record at 2-2. \nCopyright Associated Press 2015.
