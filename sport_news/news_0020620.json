The show is also available via live steam .\nBelow is a quick recap\n---\n** Weekly schedule is aligned differently with Thursday night. Monday equals normal Wednesday.\n** Last Thursday was used as an \"extra head start\" for Kentucky\n** On opening competition at all positions: \"I think competition brings out the best in everybody.\"\n** Malzahn says team got healthier, specifically older guys\n** When will Auburn name a starting QB? \"We're going to make a decision after (Tuesday)'s practice, more than likely.\" Says Sean White has done a good job, Jeremy Johnson has also done well in practice since being benched.\n** Fan question: Tanner asks do you think sitting out two games has helped Jeremy Johnson?\n\"It probably did. He got a chance to look at things from a different standpoint. Got a chance to go back to the basics in practice.\"\n** John asks about emphasis on explosive plays: \"There's no doubt.\" Says there's been \"little to none\"\n** Malzahn says cites Tony Stevens, Ricardo Louis and Jason Smith among wide receivers to step up since dismissal of D'haquille Williams\n** Reiterates Devonte Danzey and Avery Young are leaders as backup center with loss of Xavier Dampeer\n** Fan question: Brandon asks about TE/HBs in passing game:\n\"The H-backs are guys that are definitely good. ... In the past we've done a solid job with that.\"\n** AL.com question of the week: How do you tune out outside noise to make best decisions?\n\"I just think that's part of the job. ... You always think what's best for the team, that's what I try to do.\"\nMalzahn goes on to say Tom Osbourne, Tom Landry were coaches he emulated early in his career\n** On close call with JSU helping AU, as UK might benefit from OT win over EKU: \"It goes to show you got to play good football every Saturday.\"\n** On possibly going under center in goal-to-go: \"We'll mix it up\"\n** \"Offensively we've got to get some pace going, some tempo going, and we've got to have explosive plays.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.auburntigers.com/multimedia/aub-10-radio.html#tiger_talk", "http://www.auburntigers.com/collegesportslive/index.html#live"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:29:23.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
