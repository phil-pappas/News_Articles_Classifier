After losses in the first two games of the four-game series and with the chance to wrap up a wild-card berth, the Yankees rallied from a 3-0 deficit. Alex Rodriguez's first homer in two weeks gave them a 5-4 lead in the sixth. But on a night when Masahiro Tanaka struggled early in his return from a hamstring injury, the Yankees stumbled again. Still, they need just one win in their final four games to earn the playoff spot. Mookie Betts tied it with a seventh-inning homer off Betances — who has allowed six homers this season, all from July 4 on. Betts connected again in 11th to cap Boston's season-high sixth straight victory and again deny the Yankees their 10,000th win. Bailey (0-1) gave up an RBI single to Deven Marrero with one out in the 11th. Chasen Shreve yielded a run-scoring sacrifice to Jackie Bradley Jr. and a two-run homer to Betts. capecodtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:58:14.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
