Belgrade (1-5), meanwhile, could not parlay a 35-6 rout of Fergus into another all-important league win with just two contests remaining. \nThe Panthers fumbled on the game’s first offensive snap, and Havre responded with a 53-yard march capped by a 1-yard scoring plunge from Parker Filius. \nBelgrade rebounded with touchdown runs of 69 and 45 yards from quarterback Evan Luhrsen and Hayden Van Winkle, respectively, before Warp’s long toss to Rismon. Tanner Campbell picked off the 6-foot-4 signal caller soon after, returning it 24 yards to put the hosts on top by six 8:41 before intermission. \nWarp and Filius hooked up for 23 yards to square things at the break, however, and then the Blue Ponies seized control. Filius punched another one in from the 1, and Rismon burst up field and across the goal line on fourth and 8 from the Belgrade 15 with 6:49 remaining in the fourth, extending the advantage to 20. \nThat rendered Luhrsen’s 38-yard touchdown to Derek Marks in the waning moments inconsequential. \nPARK 28, BROWNING 24: Rangers quarterback Rydel Floyd hit Brock Peterson on a 5-yard toss late in the fourth, handing the hosts their first win of the season. \nFloyd finished with three touchdowns, including a 95-yarder to Austin Peterson in the second and connection of 45 with Daulton Walker in the third. David Knerr added a 10-yard touchdown run on the ground, which kicked off the scoring in this battle of winless Central A squads. \nMANHATTAN 35, CUT BANK 0: The Tigers compiled a 21-0 halftime lead with stingy defense and efficient offense and coasted against the Wolves despite maintaining possession for less than 12 minutes. \nAlec Nehring was 10 of 19 for 224 yards — Manhattan had just 299 total — and three touchdowns. Two of those came in the first half on 37- and 31-yard tosses to Caleb Neth. Those followed Michael Nehring’s 14-yard interception return with less than four minutes remaining in the opening quarter. \nShondel Connerton scored from 6 yards out, and Nehring finished off his big night with a 64-yard toss to Cole Visser in the third. Visser caught two balls for 97. \nThe Tigers defense surrendered just 19 passing yards, 208 total and allowed just two Harlowton third-down conversions in 14 attempts. \nWHITEHALL 61, THREE FORKS 0: Braden Larsen and Max Feight combined to throw eight touchdowns in a Trojans runaway. \nLarsen scored on a 22-yard run and connected with Andrew Larsen on 7-, 25- and 30-yard tosses in the first quarter alone. Larsen caught a fourth touchdown, this one from 9 yards out, in the second as Whitehall amassed a 40-point halftime lead. \nFeight hit three receivers on second-half touchdowns that covered 9, 40 and 51 yards. \nENNIS 62, HARLOWTON 12: The Mustangs continued their march toward perfection with another dominant effort, racing out to a 28-0 lead after one quarter and dismantling the Engineers. \nJake Knack (2-yard run) and Cleet Wrezinski (44-yard punt return) scored in the first four-plus minutes. Quarterback Tanner Wood connected with Gavin McKitrick for 23, and then scored on a 26-yard scamper with 23 seconds remaining in the opening frame. \nMcKitrick caught a 19-yard touchdown and intercepted Harlowton quarterback Dalton Taber, racing the opposite way to extend the advantage to 44-6 at intermission. \nThe Mustangs (7-0) finished with 256 yards of offense, more than 22 per pass and nearly 10 per rush. They have outscored opponents 406-70 with one game remaining in the regular season, an Oct. 23 visit to Twin Bridges. \nSoccer \nBOYS \nBOZEMAN 5, CMR 1: The mistakes piled up for the Hawks in an eye-opening, 7-0 loss to Billings Senior on Oct. 1. \nIn two matches since, a determined Bozeman side has piled up goals. It dispatched Skyview, 9-1, last weekend, and Friday kicked off a road trip to Great Falls with a dominant effort against the Rustlers. Chris Linkenbach led the way with three goals for the Hawks, who improved to 9-2 overall and 8-2 in Eastern AA play. \n“We realized we had a lot of work to do (after the loss to the Broncs),” Terry said. “There were a lot of mistakes that happened in that game that we can’t allow. … We’re working on it.” \nHis defense went to work early against CMR. Terry challenged his squad to deny forward passes and not allow the Rustlers to string together more than four at a time. \n“They only got three passes twice,” he said. “They spent very little time with the ball.” \nBozeman, meanwhile, made good use of their possessions. The Hawks finally found a way to navigate a packed box in the 20th minute, when Fritz Arnold crossed to Linkenbach, who fronted his defender and tapped the ball into the net. \nFive minutes, later, Wes Robbins converted a penalty kick. \nLinkenbach tucked another pass from Arnold away in the 46th minute, and then the senior found himself on a breakaway after a nice feed from Noah Metzger to complete the hat trick. \nRyan Vanderwall finished off the Rustlers in the 62nd minute, when he beat an onrushing keeper to a ball sent forward by Blake Palmquist and drilled a shot down the middle. \n“They started to press a little bit in the second half, so it opened us up to get more chances,” said Terry, whose group takes on Great Falls today. \nGIRLS \nBozeman 2, CMR 0: The Hawks produced two dominant efforts, but no wins against Senior and Skyview a week ago. \nThey were not about to drop a third straight Friday. Bozeman battled gusts and the Rustlers, broke through in the 30th minute and added another down the stretch. \n“It was really windy, but we were playing really well and creating a lot of chances,” remarked head coach Erika Cannon, whose squad improved to 9-2-1. “This was a really big win. … It was nice to get back on top and see our hard work and good play finally produce a win.” \nSydney Rollison broke the deadlock in the 30th minute, burying a pass from Sarah Budeski. \nIn the 50th minute, after a few promising chances from both sides didn’t fully materialize, Alexa Coyle bolstered the advantage. Julia Kaiser played a through ball to the junior on the outside, and Coyle sped to the edge, turned toward the goal and clipped the far corner. \n“We were still creating really dangerous opportunities like last week, but we finally just got some to go in,” Cannon said. “Some of it is just the luck of the game. … Today was a good rebound.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:48:34.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
