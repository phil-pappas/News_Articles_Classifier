This proved difficult.\n“He didn’t say anything,” said Samuel, who joined the Spartans in February of 2011 before Martin’s senior year. “He was just a quiet guy.”\nMartin’s demeanor didn’t exactly fit in with what Samuel expected of his players. Not only did Samuel want to better learn how to communicate with his charges, but sometimes the quiet players are shy, a trait that doesn’t always carry over on the football field.\n“He always had the skill-set, the ball skills,” Samuel said of Martin, who came to the Patriots in a mid-September trade with the Texans. “(But) he was so quiet, you didn’t know if there was a lack of confidence.”\nMartin knows no other way, really.\n“I mean, that’s just how I am,” he said Thursday as he prepared for practice for tonight’s game against the Colts.\nThe Michigan native didn’t have to tell Samuel when he understood something. He knew, and eventually Samuel just learned to trust that the 5-foot-11, 194-pounder knew what he was doing before being told what to do at times.\nAnd the confidence? No problem.\n“Yeah, a very quiet confidence,” Samuel said “There’s nothing that he thinks is beyond him.”\nOr as Spartans coach Mark Dantonio told Samuel: “He doesn’t talk much, but he’s electric.”\nFast to accelerate, adapt\nWhen it came to physical first impressions, Martin stood out right away upon arriving in East Lansing, Mich.\n“You’re dealing with so many guys that are just straight-line speed, track speed,” Samuel said. “The guy that can change direction with speed is very special. That’s the key. To find somebody that can see someone out of the corner of their eyes, change direction, but still accelerate fast.\n“He’s a Percy Harvin-type with great speed and then his acceleration is like 0-to-60.”\nMartin would not toot his own horn to that extent, his quiet confidence apparent when he described what he could do on the field.\n“I mean, that (confidence) is something that I’ve had and I continue to work to get better,” Martin said. “Anything I can get better at, that’s where I want to go. That’s something that I want to do.”\nMichigan State’s offense, which has produced NFL quarterbacks Kirk Cousins and Brian Hoyer under Dantonio, runs a pro-style system that took advantage of Martin’s intelligence and ability to think on the fly.\n“His skill-set during that time, he was still developing,” Samuel said of Martin, who fell under the radar a bit during the recruiting process because he played quarterback in high school. “(The Spartans) were using him . . . he was still more of a reverse guy, gimmick guy. Then once I got there and I said, ‘Look, we’re going to put you in here the whole, entire time and do what you do.’ And it just kind of freed him up, and he kept growing.”\nBut for as much as he developed, he wasn’t starting from scratch, either.\n“That’s something since I was little,” Martin said of his all-around ability. “I was always comfortable with it, and then at State is when I really did a lot of that stuff. So I’ve been comfortable with it for a long time.”\nPredisposed to the pros\nIt was no surprise, then, that when Martin was drafted by the Texans in the fourth round of the 2012 draft, he adapted quickly to pro concepts. Although he did not put up eye-popping numbers in his first three seasons (two starts, 38 receptions), Martin appeared in all 16 games each year.\n“It helped a lot,” Martin said of the preparation at Michigan State. “Just going from that system, the Houston system, I’m not going to say (it was) easy for me because as a rookie, it’s not easy at all, but it made me a little more comfortable.”\nSaid Samuel: “I told people he’s going to be able to fit in. He’s got the quickness, catches everything around. I just knew being in this offense it was going to be a very easy transition for him. It was always about getting him to the right team. And he got with the Texans and he played right off.”\nIt also didn’t hurt his chances to get on the field quickly in Foxboro after playing for former Pats offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien his last two years in Houston.\n“It’s similar,” Martin said. “Stuff is similar, but I’ve just got to continue to get better every week and continue to learn.”\nHe learned quickly. In his first appearance in a Pats uniform, he caught three passes for 33 yards and a touchdown against Jacksonville, then caught two more against Dallas last Sunday, giving him one fewer reception than he had in all of 2014.\n“I think he’s in a really good situation right now,” Samuel said.\nIn Martin’s case, that goes without saying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:36:04.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
