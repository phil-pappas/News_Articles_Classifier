(AP Photo) Comments \nEntering the Buffalo Bills' previous game, offensive tackle Cyrus Kouandjio's NFL experience in 21 games in the league consisted of 24 snaps with the offense and 24 on special teams. \nIn London on Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the former Alabama standout will make his first NFL start. \nIn Buffalo's 14-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, right offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson suffered a concussion. He didn't make the trip with the Bills to London, where Buffalo will play the Jaguars at 8:30 a.m. CDT Sunday. \nRELATED: HOW TO SEE SUNDAY'S BILLS-JAGUARS GAME \nOn Friday, Buffalo coach Rex Ryan said Kouandjio would start in Henderson's place. Kouandjio played 56 snaps with the Bills' offense against Tennessee after Henderson left the game. \n\"I'm coming here to do anything I can for this team,\" Kouandjio said . \"They want me to play, and that's what I'm going to do.\" \nKouandjio joined the Bills as a second-round selection in the 2014 NFL Draft. But he played in only one game, getting on the field for three special-teams plays as a rookie. \n\"There's a lot of ups and downs in the NFL,\" Kouandjio said . \"The biggest thing I learned about myself is resilience, playing through all types of situations with my mind, with my body. Sucking it up and going. The best thing to do is to keep pushing â€“ 'til your bones collapse, keep pushing it.\" \nKouandjio lost the competition for the right offensive tackle spot to Henderson, a seventh-round draft pick in 2014, in training camp last year and couldn't unseat him when a new coaching staff came in with Ryan this year. \n\"You need to go through struggles in your life,\" Kouandjio said . \"Actually my dad used to tell me growing up: 'The only way you purify gold is by putting it through the fire.' So you'll come out stronger.\" \nKouandjio said he understood why his playing time had been limited. \n\"I had to really improve on my pass protection,\" Kouandjio said . \"Just sharpen my tools, basically, and get better at it.\" \nThe Bills might be playing to Kouandjio's strength, though, against Jacksonville, because quarterback Tyrod Taylor will miss the game with a knee injury. \n\"I just love run blocking,\" Kouandjio said . \"I love taking on a man against his will and driving him back. I love it.\" \nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE \nTaylor won't be the only Buffalo regular who'll miss Sunday's game. Right guard John Miller left the team in London to fly back to the United States because of a death in his family. Kraig Urbik will step in, giving the Bills two backups in the right side of their offensive line for Sunday's game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:47:11.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
