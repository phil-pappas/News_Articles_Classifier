Actually, it first broke in Boston Magazine, but it was the topic of conversation on Tom Brady's weekly radio appearance Monday on the \"Dennis & Callahan Morning Show\" on WEEI. It was about Alex Guerrero, who is Brady's fitness guru, business partner, close friend, and godfather to Brady's son, Ben. The gist of the article is that Guerrero once pedaled an untested product called Supreme Greens that he claimed could cure diseases including cancer, AIDS, diabetes, and obesity. The article points out that the Federal Trade Commission rebuked Guerrero for falsely claiming to be a doctor and prohibited him from ever again promoting Supreme Greens or \"any substantially similar product\" as an effective treatment for a disease. The overall message of the article is that Guerrero is a slick quack. He also has been deeply linked to the Patriots for a while now. He first worked closely with Willie McGinest, and players ranging from former backup quarterback Brian Hoyer to current wide receivers Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman have testified to his remarkable ability to help players heal from injuries. Brady has been close to Guerrero since 2008, when he suffered a season-ending ACL tear. The two are now business partners at TB12, a sports-therapy center at Patriot Place, where they are marketing a revolutionary training regimen. Boston Magazine reported that their partnership has already run into trouble with the FTC, which protested claims Guerrero made in 2011 for NeuroSafe, a \"seatbelt for your brain\" whose label said it was \"powered by TB12.\" The product is no longer made. During his radio interview, Brady clearly wanted nothing to do with any criticism of Guerrero. No big surprise. We all know about Brady's obsession and routine. We all know his absolute single-mindedness, his incredible resolve. Isn't that, in many ways, the back story of his incredible success? Hasn't that always been the fuel that's taken a sixth-round draft choice to the very top of the football world? So are we really surprised that he would give his allegiance to someone he believes has helped make his dreams come true? We also know that he is obsessed with hanging on to the life he has for as long as he possibly can. He has made no secret of the fact that he wants to keep playing well into his 40s. \"In the 10 or 11 years we've been working together he's never been wrong,\" Brady said on the radio show. It was not Brady's only defense of Guerrero, not even close. \"When you say, 'This sounds like quackery,' there's a lot of things I see on a daily basis in Western medicine that I think, 'Wow, why would we ever do that. That is crazy. That doesn't work,'\" Brady said. Guerrero has been cited in many articles about Brady, including one in The New York Times that referred to him as the quarterback's \"spiritual guide, counselor, pal, nutrition dealer, trainer, massage therapist, and family member.\" So what is going on here? One thing is certain. For the most part athletes will believe in someone if they think that someone can help them. So the fact Brady swears by Guerrero should come as little surprise, no matter what swirls around Guerrero. For Brady is now 38, playing as well as he's ever played, and he gives Guerrero a lot of credit for that. So why wouldn't he support him, even if Guerrero seems somewhat tainted to others? The surprising thing would be if he didn't. Brady, by all accounts, lives inside the bubble he's created for himself. The way he eats. The way he works out. The way he takes cares care of himself. The way he does everything. In his mind these are the reasons he is where he is today, someone who long surpassed everyone's expectations, someone who has seen all his dreams come true by following his own heart. Does anyone really expect him to question the people who helped him get there? If we've come to know anything about Brady in this amazing football journey of his, it's that he is going to do things his way. Even if the bullets are now flying all around Guerrero, you can rest assured Brady's going to continue to believe in him. Everything else is just noise. All the noise Brady long ago learned to tune out. The reason he is where he is today.Brady southcoasttoday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:47:14.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
