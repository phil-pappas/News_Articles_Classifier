(AP Photo/Mary Ann Chastain) Comments \nNo offense to Nick Chubb, but if Georgia beats Alabama, he's probably not going to be the primary reason. \nNo pressure on Greyson Lambert, but if the Dogs are going to have their day, he's probably going to have to lead the way. \nHe'll likely need his own Stephen Garcia moment. \nRemember Garcia? Alabama fans do, and not fondly. He was the solid but unspectacular South Carolina quarterback who raised his game to another level in 2010 to hand the Crimson Tide its first regular-season defeat in three years. He almost couldn't miss, finishing 17 of 20 for 201 yards and three touchdowns. \nThat game may have been an exception for Garcia, but a quarterback having a big day has been the rule for teams that take down the Crimson Tide. Study the 18 games Alabama has lost during Saban's tenure, and a river of similar numbers runs through them. \nYou beat the Crimson Tide by throwing the ball, not running it. \nYou know how many backs have run for more than 100 yards in a victory over Saban and the Crimson Tide? Two. Auburn's Tre Mason powered his way to 164 yards in the 2013 Iron Bowl. Quarterback Nick Marshall came up just short, jetting for 99 yards as the Tigers rolled up 296 yards on the ground. \nThat was an overall outlier, as was Ohio State's Ezekiel Elliott, who ran away from the Alabama defense for 230 yards in the 2015 Sugar Bowl. \nNow look at the number of quarterbacks that have thrown for 200-plus yards in a victory over Saban and Alabama. That number is 12. \nIn chronological order: Georgia's Matthew Stafford (224 yards), Florida State's Xavier Lee (224), LSU's Matt Flynn (353), Florida's Tim Tebow (216), Utah's Brian Johnson (336), Garcia (201), Auburn's Cam Newton (216), Texas A&M's Johnny Manziel (253), Oklahoma's Trevor Knight (348), Mississippi's Bo Wallace (251), Ohio State's Cardale Jones (243) and Mississippi's Chad Kelly (341). \nEven more startling, those 12 quarterbacks combined to throw 32 touchdown passes and just nine interceptions. \nRELATED: Why the numbers say Georgia will beat Alabama \nThe last team to beat Alabama without a 200-yard passer: Auburn in the 2013 Iron Bowl, with Marshall, Mason and company running wild on the read option. But even the Tigers tied that game late in the fourth quarter with a pop pass. \nScan that list of quarterbacks. There are three Heisman Trophy winners in Tebow, Newton and Manziel and another future NFL starter in Stafford, but there are also names that would fit nicely in a \"Where are they now?\" feature. \nSo you don't need a Heisman quarterback or an NFL signal caller to beat Alabama. You probably do need a quarterback having a special day. \nThe ball and the moment are in your hands, Mr. Lambert.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:03:14.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
