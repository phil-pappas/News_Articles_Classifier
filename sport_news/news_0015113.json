A A A \nThe exact number of years it’s been since Canyon High girls tennis remained in contention for a postseason berth this late in the season isn’t necessarily important — or clear. \nBut the Katrina DeGuzman-led Cowboys are certainly in the mix, and Tuesday’s 15-3 win over Golden Valley on the road was just the next step. \n“People have told me it’s been a while,” said second-year Canyon head coach Richard Bristow, whose team finished 0-10 in Foothill League play last season. “How long? I don’t know.” \nDeGuzman swept three sets Tuesday — all by 6-0 scores — to improve to 21-0 in Foothill League sets on the season. \nThe defending Foothill League singles champion sees Canyon (7-6 overall, 3-4 in Foothill) as being somewhere she hadn’t seen it before. \n“We’re doing much better this year,” DeGuzman said. “We beat Golden Valley and Saugus, and we never beat Saugus in all my four years (previously).” \nThe Cowboys see that Saugus win — a 9-9 victory decided by games on Oct. 7 — as a potential springboard. But they’ll likely have to beat the Centurions again if they’re to earn at least an at-large bid to the playoffs. \nCanyon currently sits in fourth place — one match behind Hart for third place. \nA key to a potential playoff push may be the continued improvement of Canyon’s doubles teams. \nThe No. 1 pairing of Leena Schultz and Adrienne Kashay won three sets Tuesday, and Bristow said Schultz — a former Canyon basketball player — is getting more comfortable all the time. \n“You can see her feel for the game is getting better and better and better,” Bristow said. \nCanyon singles, however, carried the day on Tuesday, sweeping all nine sets. \nCowboys Amanda Yeam and Natalie Tseng won three sets each. \nGolden Valley (1-12, 0-7) was led by the pairing of Abigail Yang and Celeste Lo, who won two sets 6-1, 6-1. \nIt was Lo’s third match on varsity, she said, after recently making the move up from junior varsity. \n“She hits a good ball,” Golden Valley head coach Josh Stimac said of Lo. “She and (Abigail) work well together.” \nWest Ranch 12, Hart 6 \nThe Wildcats went with an unusual lineup to all but wrap up second place in league Tuesday. \nOlivia Bloome and Brittany Waugh, the Foothill’s top doubles team, didn’t play together. And the normal No. 1 single, Quinterra Walter-Eze, played doubles. \nIt didn’t matter, as the second-place Wildcats (7-3, 5-2) beat the third-place Indians (7-7, 4-3) for the second time this season. \nWaugh won three doubles sets playing with Audrey Kim, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1. \nWalter-Eze and Cori Raffish won 6-3, 6-0, 6-0. \nAnd Bloome won one set 6-0. \nShe ran into trouble against Hart’s dynamic 1-2 singles duo. \nNicole Alvarez beat Bloome 6-2. Natalia Munoz topped her 6-0. \nMunoz won her other two sets 6-0, as well. Alvarez took two more sets, 6-0, 6-2. \nValencia 16, Saugus 2 \nThe Vikings’ singles swept and their No. 1 doubles team got an impressive win in a rout at Valencia High on Tuesday. \nThe pairing of Gianna Benitez and Lauren Wolf beat Saugus’ Megan Cho and Carlie Ozaki 6-3 in a matchup of two of the league’s better doubles teams. \nCho and Ozaki won their other two sets 6-3, 6-3. \nViking Kate Zeile swept three sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-1. Valencia’s Amanda Tabanera and Jennifer Shin won two sets each before being subbed out. \nValencia (13-2, 7-0) remains alone in first place and at the top of the CIF-Southern Section Division 2 poll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:28:36.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
