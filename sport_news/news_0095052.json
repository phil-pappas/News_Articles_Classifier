But still, if he has both a brain and a heart—and there is ample evidence of both—he might be facing a decision that a few weeks from now will be keeping him up at night: What to do with Daniel Murphy ?\nThis was already a dilemma last off-season, when Murphy and the Mets avoided arbitration with a one-year, $8 million deal. It was a dilemma again as the trade deadline neared this summer and New York had to decide which players to pursue and which might need to be jettisoned. Now it is a dilemma that is at once careering toward a resolution (he’ll be a free agent five days after the World Series ends) and also getting more complicated each time that Murphy—a Mets lifer like few the faithful have ever seen—steps onto the field.\nMurphy, as you (and Mr. Alderson) know by now, is the planet’s hottest hitter. He is treating the National League’s premier aces—guys like Clayton Kershaw , Zack Greinke , Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta —as if they were batting-cage pitching machines. Murphy now has five home runs in seven postseason games, all off that quartet of frontline pitchers, and he is the eighth player ever to homer in four straight postseason games. He beat the Dodgers in Game 5 of the NLDS practically by himself (home run, RBI double, savvy stolen base), and he made an atypically graceful diving play to close out Game 1 of the NLCS against the Cubs .\nChicago is terrified of him. In Game 2, its manager, Joe Maddon intentionally walked Murphy, who hit 14 home runs during the regular season, to face cleanup hitter Yoenis Cespedes , who hit 35. “I didn’t want to mess with it,” said Maddon of the Murphy mojo.\nEach time that Murphy comes up to bat at home, Citi Field rocks as if the Beatles were in town, circa 1965. People scream and call his name. And in the men’s room in the highest reaches of the stadium, bearded beery guys break into chants of “Re-sign Murphy! Re-sign Murphy!”\nMLB Video Mets jump on Jake Arrieta early to take 2–0 NLCS lead over Cubs by Jay Jaffe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:12:48.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
