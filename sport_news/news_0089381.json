Tom Brady’s life just keeps getting better.\nAdChoices There is no career twilight, no perceptible decline, no evidence that his 38-year-old body and mind are eroding. His jawline is still square, his wife is still soft on the eyes and his (surgically repaired?) hairline has not backpedaled yet.\nRELATED: Tom Brady wants to play another 10 years, but history says otherwise\nIt’s disgusting. No man should have it this good.\nBrady’s football greatness has been chronicled for 16 years. It’s easy to be jealous of someone so ridiculously great at his profession. Sure, the future Hall of Famer likely knew about the air-pressure hi-jinx that dominated the offseason headlines, but if you believe that Brady needed deflated footballs to turn into the best quarterback of this generation, it might be a good time to remove your blindfold.\n“He’s ageless,” outside linebacker Calvin Pace said Wednesday. “I’m pretty sure he’ll be out there when he’s 45 still doing the same thing…. It seems like he hasn’t had any drop-off. He’s still making the same plays. If anything, he’s gotten better with age.”\nBrady has outlasted Peyton Manning, who is fading before our eyes. Brady is sharper, smarter and somehow better now than he’s ever been. It defies logic. It’s one of the great sports mysteries of our time. How can an old player still be ascending?\n“When (Michael) Jordan was up there in age, he was still one of the best in the league,” Jets linebackers coach Mike Caldwell said. “Jordan developed a post-up game. So you can always add something. This year, (Brady’s) getting the ball out quicker. He’s scrambling just enough. He’s stepping up in the pocket. He’s 38, but his game’s evolving just like Jordan. When you can’t jump and dunk anymore, you find another way. And that way is going to be just as successful if you put the time in.”\nBrady’s game is growing out of necessity. The Patriots’ injury-marred offensive line stinks. That’s not a hyperbole. It’s horrific.\nTom Brady Career Touchdown and Interception Percentages | PointAfter\nBill Belichick knows it. Brady knows it. Gisele knows it.\nSo, how has Brady raced out to such an impressive start? (His lone interception in the first five games came off a perfect pass that bounced off a four-fingered receiver).\nWhy are the Patriots undefeated entering Sunday’s divisional showdown against the Jets?\nA transcendent quarterback can overcome widespread shortcomings. Brady, who is just off the pace of Manning’s single-season record for passing yards, has added to his already frightening repertoire to mask deficiencies along his reshuffled offensive line.\nBrady has shown more functional mobility when the pocket collapses. He shredded the Colts last week after losing his backup left tackle, who replaced his starting left tackle a week earlier, by consistently extending plays.\nThe Patriots’ scheme loaded with quick crossing routes, pick plays and wide receiver hitches certainly helps mask the offensive line’s issues, but Brady’s willingness to adjust so deep into his career is the most pivotal element to the team’s early-season success.\n“His will and drive to get better in an area of his game that he didn’t feel like was as productive as he wanted it to be is really where that stems from,” Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said. “He’s definitely improved in that area…. He’s creating a lot of big plays in his own way.”\nAt his age, Brady should be riding off into the sunset like Manning and Drew Brees. Instead, it’s always high noon for him.\nThe Jets’ top-ranked defense has history on its side against the Patriots’ top-scoring offense this weekend. Since 1970, the team with the No. 1 defense has won 11 of 16 games against opponents with the No. 1 offense in Week 7 or later. Those numbers, however, should mean nothing to Brady, who is 6-0 when facing a team with the No. 1 defense this late in the season.\nFor all the trouble that Rex Ryan supposedly gave Brady the past six seasons, the quarterback still won nine of 13 games with 23 touchdowns and seven interceptions against those Jets. Ryan stymied Brady in the Jets’ 2010 divisional playoff win thanks to a creative wrinkle to flooding the field with defensive backs, but that now looks like an aberration. Brady usually makes timely plays to beat the Jets (and most other teams).\n“You never see any panic in the guy,” Jets defensive backs coach Joe Danna said. “He seems to always make good decisions and put the ball where he needs to.”\nA couple years ago, Brady envisioned playing until he was 50. The quarterback said Wednesday that he’d like to play “maybe 10 more years.”\nCaldwell believes those predictions might be too conservative.\n“Forever,” the Jets coach said with a straight face.\nNobody has it better than Tom Brady. It’s enough to want to make you throw up.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://football-players.pointafter.com/l/2073/Tom-Brady", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/6Zw1zBkQAq9", "http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:22:45.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
