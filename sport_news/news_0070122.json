Since 1969, when it took his first wife, Grace, Hill dedicated much of his life to under- standing the disease.\nHe read voraciously, devoted endless hours to research at the University of Colorado's medical school library, probed for a weakness and constructed a theory to exploit it.\nThere was a catch: He had no formal medical training and no access to the millions of dollars that rigorous cancer research demands.\nIn March 2014, Hill learned he lacked one more vital requirement: time. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and doctors gave him only weeks to live.\nBut Hill, a Presbyterian minister whose back story includes a battle with the New York mob that inspired a Disney movie, had compelling intellect, determination and a preacher's power of persuasion on his side. He saw his own diagnosis as a final chance to advance his research through a human trial — on himself.\n\"On one hand, he was extremely accepting that he was 88 years old and he was going to die,\" recalls Cydney Peshut, one of Hill's five adult children. \"He was completely expecting that. On the other hand, he had cancer, which was a disease he thought he could cure.\"\nHis family resolved to honor his wish and help him pursue the therapy he had constructed over his lifetime, a complex regimen of glucose, insulin and potassium calibrated to kick-start the immune system into fighting cancer the way it fights infections.\nAdvertisement Efforts to secure the necessary assistance from medical providers would reprise Hill's lifelong battle for credibility: What did a minister know about treating cancer?\nHe knew he would not beat it. But in the end, what mattered was pushing back with whatever he had left — in this case, an immunology-based regimen that he envisioned as his most lasting legacy.\nTo even consider his request, doctors would want to see a precise description of his required intravenous protocol — a tricky trial of sequence and timing that, at the advanced stage of his cancer, could very possibly kill him.\nAnd so, shortly after his diagnosis, Cydney sat bedside in her father's Denver apartment while his mind strained against his energy-sapping illness. She clutched a notebook and a pen and took dictation as Hill struggled to construct the road map for his treatment.\nSoon, he drifted off to sleep and awoke a short time later.\n\"Did we get it?\" he asked.\nCydney wrestled with whether to tell him they had fallen short or pretend that the task had been completed.\nCydney Peshut, daughter of the late Albert Fay Hill, a Presbyterian minister who devoted much of his life to finding a cure for cancer, sits in her living room surrounded by folders of her father's research. ( RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post ) \"We did really good work, Dad,\" she finally said. \"I think maybe there's a little more to do, but we'll wait till you're ready.\"\n\"OK,\" he replied. \"That's good.\"\n<<<\nBy the time Hill arrived at North Avenue Presbyterian Church in the New York City suburb of New Rochelle at the dawn of the '60s, he already had earned a reputation as a man quick to take up for a righteous cause.\nHe earned a Bronze Star and Purple Heart as a paratrooper during World War II, then used the G.I. Bill to attend DePauw University and later Union Theological Seminary. Along the way, he met and married Grace Grogan and launched his work as a pastor.\nIt was an era ripe with possibility for someone looking to exercise a keen social conscience. Hill marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., fully embraced the civil rights movement and witnessed the \"I Have A Dream\" speech. He battled slumlords and McCarthyism. He advocated for the arts and persuaded musicians such as Duke Ellington and Ravi Shankar to perform at North Avenue and baseball great Jackie Robinson to preach.\n\"Everyone in the church adored him,\" says Kristin Cristiano, the older of his two daughters. \"He was just a magnet for amazing things.\"\nNone received more acclaim than his partnership with the U.S. Department of the Treasury in creating a task force to weed out organized crime from New Rochelle. With the help of women in his congregation, dubbed the \"lace pants brigade,\" he orchestrated undercover volunteers to tail crooks and report on illegal gambling activities.\nFamily photos, from an album at his daughter's home, of Albert Fay Hill working in his study ( . RJ Sangosti, The Denver Post ) Look magazine, then one of the nation's top periodicals, celebrated Hill and his efforts in a major article, then urged him to expand his tale into a book. In 1968, he published \"The North Avenue Irregulars\" — a title that played off the intelligence gathering, street-urchin characters of Sherlock Holmes stories.\nFor Hill's children, the mob intervention began as an exciting adventure. But as the kids slowly became aware of the dangers their father faced, the experience became unnerving.\nThose who were old enough to walk to school were always supplied with change to make an emergency pay phone call. They even had a code phrase in the event they were in danger but could not speak freely: \"Your cousin Amelia called.\"\nAlthough they never invoked the code, there was one night when their house suddenly teemed with police investigating a bomb threat. The mob reportedly put out a contract on the minister, and police began parking in front of the house for security. Hill started carrying a gun, although he tried — unsuccessfully — to conceal it from his children.\nKristin felt sure her father would be killed. But it was her mother who was slowly dying.\nBefore Hill took up his crusade against the mob, Grace was diagnosed with breast cancer, a condition that had been concealed for months by a pregnancy. She underwent a single, radical mastectomy and followed an exceptionally strict diet during her illness.\nThe kids remember snapshots from the menu: Dry potatoes. Greens — lots of greens. Calves liver juice, squeezed in a press, then choked down and chased with orange juice to combat the taste.\nAlthough the therapy was never officially approved to treat any disease, Grace believed that the dietary measures helped. Doctors initially gave her six months to live, but she would stretch that to several more years.\n\"For Dad, the thing was he believed that you fix things,\" recalls David, the oldest of the five kids. \"He encountered something there was no way to fix, and he had this really powerful belief that he had to find some way to do something about it.\"\nAnd although some of the dietary ideas sparked Hill's own thinking about immunology, he eventually took his research in another direction — one he would pursue for the rest of his life.\nMeanwhile, the bills associated with Grace's treatment drained the Hills' finances. Soon after publication of the book, Walt Disney Studios purchased the film rights in what proved a fortuitous windfall for the family.\nAlthough Hill had envisioned a serious film, there were undeniably comedic threads in the story, and Disney seized on those to eventually produce a 1979 box-office success, \"The North Avenue Irregulars.\"\n\"Within the limits of Disney, it's a pretty good job,\" Hill told The Denver Post at the time of the movie's release. \"They don't want too much danger or reality. I would have liked a little more reality, but I've made peace with myself about how they've handled it.\"\n<<<\nThe Rev. Albert Fay Hill was a minor celebrity when he was installed in 1968 as senior pastor at Denver's Montview Boulevard Presbyterian Church, then one of the denomination's largest congregations in the western U.S.\nBut six months after the family settled into the Park Hill neighborhood, Grace succumbed to cancer at 42. Her death devastated Hill — and on top of that, he suddenly had five children, ages 7 to 17, to care for by himself.\n\"Until the moment she died, he believed she was going to live, that they'd find a way to heal her,\" Cydney says. \"Dad wanted to save her, and he couldn't. So he continued trying to save everybody else.\"\nHis tenure at Montview ended after six years, though, when he resigned amid growing dissatisfaction among his congregation over what one fellow pastor described as conflicts over management style and personal issues.\nHe turned to writing, co-authoring science-fiction novels with his son David, and diving deeper into his cancer research. In 1974, he married Nancy Vandemoer, who would be his partner, sounding board and editor until her death, from lupus, in 2008.\nHe also moved ahead with his study and experimentation around the theory of using glucose, insulin and potassium — GIK in shorthand — to stimulate the immune system and program it to fight tumors.\nA voracious speed reader, Hill constantly had piles of material stacked by his favorite chairs at home, and he became a fixture at CU's nearby medical school library. With the advent of the Internet, he eventually would pore over material online in his home office.\n\"The thought of trying to find a cure for cancer, to self-educate on that, is a ridiculous thought to most people,\" says Geoffrey, the second-youngest son. \"He had to do it. He was obsessed with the idea.\"\nBut passion and intellect didn't quickly translate to credibility when it came to connecting with established medical experts.\n\"My father was by nature a minister,\" says Jim, the youngest son. \"He spoke in grand terms, used the language of the quest and so forth. Sometimes people in the medical field who are much more restrained would react negatively to his zeal.\"\nDavid, who spent hours discussing research with his father, tried to reinforce the simple truth that he needed to emphasize the scientific underpinnings of his theories.\n\"There are so many quack cures out there,\" David says. \"I told Dad, you've got to separate yourself from these people. You can't say you've got a magic bullet. You've got to emphasize that you did this scientifically, that you think you found something that's effective that other people missed. He was not into alternative medicine. He wanted to work with the medical community on this, not sell rose water to cure cancer.\"\nAt times, his work showed tantalizing promise.\nIn the early '90s, Hill treated a Rottweiler named Macho, the beloved companion of a wealthy California businessman who happened to be friends with Hill's younger brother.\nLes Hill, who had done well in business himself, mentioned the cancer work to his friend, who was eager to try any therapy that might address Macho's grotesque tumor diagnosed as a particularly nasty form of canine cancer.\nA veterinarian administered the protocol. The tumor liquefied within 48 hours, and the pathology report triggered a celebration at the Hill house.\nThe results prompted Les and a couple of his friends, including Macho's owner, to invest in ongoing research. A corporation was formed, patents were obtained and more formal experiments were initiated.\nA double-blind study with mice done in collaboration with Dr. Daniel Chan, then an assistant professor at the University of Colorado medical school, revealed that mice that underwent his protocol showed significantly reduced tumor growth over a control group.\nHill kept a framed printout of a graph illustrating the study's findings on the wall of his home office. And while his protocol continued to evolve, Hill knew he needed to get his research published — and that a paper authored by a layman wouldn't be taken seriously.\nAlthough he labored against his lack of credentials, Hill had a few things working in his favor.\nLes, aside from digging into his own deep pockets to help fund research, also was a benefactor of the Scripps Research Institute in California and carried enough clout to get his brother in the door for a collaboration that replicated the earlier study on mice.\nHill also had a good friend and former next-door neighbor in David Boone, a patent attorney who worked in the pharmaceutical industry and thought Hill's findings might deserve further consideration, even though he couldn't see a company becoming interested in a protocol based on existing materials.\nIt was simple economics: There was no sexy wonder drug with which to recoup massive research and development costs.\nBoone passed Hill's name to Bill Polvino, a physician who ran clinical research. They wound up collaborating with another researcher, Darcy Wilson, on a paper addressing Hill's protocol that in 2005 was published in the Journal of Immune Based Therapies and Vaccines.\n\"I can't say this one slam-dunk blew me away, absolutely positively,\" Polvino said. \"But I'm like, holy cow, he's got some real evidence here. Maybe it wasn't perfect, but frankly, there's a hurdle to make things perfect.\"\nThat hurdle was money. Hill's research stalled as Polvino helped him refine protocols for human trials that never quite materialized. His brother passed away, and funding evaporated.\nHill's ideas were very much alive. But his lab research flatlined. He continued studying and revising his protocol, hoping that perhaps one day the research might be resuscitated.\n\"There's probably a million things out there that might work, where we haven't formally given it a full shot yet,\" Polvino said. \"Of those million things, we can't do them all. The reason this one bothers me is because I saw it. And I haven't seen it formally fail.\"\n<<<\nHill never tired of being a minister.\nWhen he finally moved into a seniors residence, a friend asked if he would lead Sunday services there. He approached the task with enthusiasm.\nRather than recycle old sermons, he labored over fresh, relevant material, typed it out and practiced it. He created a bulletin to guide worshipers and invited his granddaughter, a talented vocalist, to lead the hymns.\nBut one Sunday morning in March 2014, as Cydney dropped off her daughter at her dad's apartment, he answered the door looking horrible.\n\"Cydney, something is wrong,\" he said.\nHe had awakened in the middle of the night feeling ill, and his condition grew progressively worse. The next day, he learned he had pancreatic cancer so advanced that, his doctor said, he probably would not want to be treated and had perhaps three weeks to live.\nOn a visit to see an oncologist to talk about the possibility of chemotherapy, Hill turned the tables and spent more than an hour explaining his immunology-based protocol to the doctor before asking to be used as a human trial for the therapy.\nIt was no small request. The protocol would require careful administration and oversight, with little chance to improve his health. But for Hill, survival was beside the point.\n\"Dad said flat-out he thought it would probably kill him,\" David said. \"He thought he was already too sick to be saved, that the (immune) reaction would be fatal. But he wanted to be allowed to do it, so doctors would have in their notes what had happened. That would be his final test.\"\nFor a period of three or four weeks, Hill's children and others worked feverishly on realizing his request — trying to address legal concerns and help Hill put together his specific protocol.\nEllen Winner, Hill's patent attorney, contacted state legislators who had supported Colorado's \"Right to Try Act\" that allows for use of experimental drugs by terminally ill patients in some cases. Although Hill's situation didn't fall under the law, some lawmakers made inquiries on his behalf to find doctors willing to undertake the protocol.\nThere were no takers.\nWinner filed one last patent application for Hill. His previous patents had expired, and he didn't intend to follow through on a new one. But the filing enabled Hill to update his research and detail everything he had learned in a document published in the public domain.\n\"He wanted everybody to be able to use it,\" Winner says. \"I think that was on his mind. He wanted to give it to the world, to put it out there in a publication.\"\nWith options exhausted, the family put him into hospice care. Hill's final human trial never materialized. He died May 1, 2014, a little more than six weeks after his diagnosis.\nIn boxes of binders, dozens of file folders and untold bytes of computer files, family members have kept his work in storage, hopeful that someone might consider it worthy of review at a time when immunology-based cancer research has made new advances.\nThey had talked with him at various times about spreading his research through social media, but he resisted. He always preferred to advance his ideas face to face, where his sheer rhetorical powers might win over skeptics.\nAfter his death, though, the family launched an effort to publicize his work through Facebook and Twitter.\nIn part, they simply wanted to honor their father's memory. But true to his spirit, they haven't given up hope that the work of a lifetime might somehow contribute to other advances in the field.\n\"His fear was that his work would die with him, and if there was something there, it wouldn't get pursued,\" says Jim. \"He thought he had it. He really did.\"\nTaking hill's research social\nRev. Albert Fay Hill's family created a social media presence that describes his cancer work and links to other research on immunology-based research.\nFacebook page: Albert Fay Hill Cancer Therapy\nTwitter account: @AFHCancerThpy", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1017/20151017__20151018_A1_A1-cd18fayhillp2~p1.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1017/20151017__20151018_A16_A16-cd18fayhilljp1~p1.jpg", "http://www.jibtherapies.com/content/3/1/5#", "https://www.facebook.com/HillCancerTherapy25", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079639"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:08:05.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
