(AP) - Despite Oklahoma fans' shock and disappointment following last Saturday's 24-17 loss to rival Texas, their Sooners are in virtually the same position they were in before the game.\nOklahoma (4-1, 1-1 Big 12) still has No. 2 Baylor, No. 3 TCU and unbeaten No. 16 Oklahoma State on the schedule - excellent chances to leap right back into the playoff picture. The Sooners still have big-time goals, and they are using Ohio State's example from last season as a rallying cry. The Buckeyes lost at home to Virginia Tech early and rallied to win the national title.\nTraditionally, Oklahoma bounces back well. The 19th-ranked Sooners haven't lost back-to-back regular-season games since 1999, a span of 34 games. They'll face a Kansas State squad that lost 52-45 to TCU last Saturday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
