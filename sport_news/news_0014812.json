With every break in the action, with every fiber of their being, the largest crowd ever gathered for a Mets game at Citi Field clamored for its pound of flesh. \n\"We want Utley!\" they roared Monday night, their hatred for longtime foil Chase Utley rising like a mushroom cloud over Queens. Only ancient Romans could muster such blood lust. Latest Mets stories LI's Matz ready for Game 4 \nThe Mets could have given in to temptation. They could have let Game 3 of the National League Division Series turn into Fight Night at Citi Field. The fans would have loved that, too, their thirst for eye-for-an-eye frontier justice quenched with a plunking. Stats Game 3 boxscore: Mets vs. Dodgers Vote Mets vs. Dodgers: Who has the edge?

It had been two days since Utley's takeout shattered his right leg. The Mets used their fallen teammate as a rallying point. \n\"I think everybody feels badly for Ruben, but what's done is done,\" David Wright said before the game. \"The only thing we can do now in support of Ruben is going out there and getting back the way that we know how to get back, and that's winning two games here.\" \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nNow, the Mets are halfway to that goal, thanks to an onslaught that chased starter Brett Anderson after three innings and covered for a shaky Matt Harvey. \nYoenis Cespedes crushed a three-run homer that landed in the upper deck in leftfield, 431 feet away. Travis d'Arnaud knocked in three runs, including a two-run shot. Curtis Granderson equaled a franchise postseason record with five RBIs on a pair of wall-crashing doubles. Mets NLDS Game 3: Mets vs. Dodgers \nThe Mets' 13 runs set a franchise postseason record. \nNow, the Dodgers send their ace Clayton Kershaw to the mound Tuesday night in Game 4, Kershaw will be opposed by Steven Matz, the Ward Melville product who was just a fan when the Mets last hosted a postseason game in 2006. \nDuring introductions before the first pitch, the fans erupted when Utley was shown on the video board. For good measure, the public address announcer paused for a few extra beats, opening the door for more venom to flow from the stands. \nHarvey, in his first playoff start, allowed three runs (two earned) and struck out seven, but got the victory despite falling into a 3-0 hole in the second. The Mets responded by scoring 10 unanswered runs. \nBy the time Harvey was pinch hit for in the fifth, departing after 97 pitches, the crowd of 44,276 had shifted its focus from victory to revenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:02:07.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
