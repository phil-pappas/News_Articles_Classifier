The court had before it a simple matter relating to the accelerated promotion to reserved category employees in the state. It should have been dealt in that manner. But the court chose to invoke the special status of the state and its relationship with the rest of India. This has long-term consequences in this highly volatile state, where the opinion on the special status is divided. Most of the Kashmiri Muslim parties, particularly the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, as well as the CPI-M and the Congress, view this Article as a matter of faith and a custodian of identity. However, the minorities see in this constitutional provision a trampling on their rights and existence. Article 370 was never a provision that had a universal appeal for all residents of the state. The High Court based its judgment on the plea that the Constituent Assembly of the state was dissolved in January 1957, without recommending the word “temporary”. Hence this Article, that grants special status to the state in which it enjoys distinct privileges like its legislature framing its own laws, separate Constitution and flag, cannot be undone. This was the argument of the HC bench that delivered this judgment on October 8. The division bench of the High Court was dealing with a simple matter. It was to be decided whether promotions to the reserved category employees, belonging to the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and the Residents of Backward Areas under a law passed by the state legislature in 2005 were valid or not. The judgment went back to 1947, suggesting that if this Article is to be opened, the question of accession of the state with India too would have to be re-opened. The fact that the affected sections of society have pointed out that the accelerated promotions were as per the law passed by the state legislature in 2005, when the People’s Democratic Party and the Congress were ruling the state, was not given due weightage. It has gladdened all those believing in preserving, and reverting to the original position of the state as it existed till the early 1950s, better known as the pre-1953 status, when Jammu and Kashmir had control over all the affairs barring external, defence and communications. This was akin to the Instrument of Accession signed by other princely states. The core difference in Jammu and Kashmir’s case was that this state did not merge with the Indian Union, though accession is an all-time constitutional and legal fact, which is unchallengeable. The last Dogra ruler of the state, Maharaja Hari Singh, had signed the Instrument of Accession with India. The king had sought Indian help in repulsing Pakistan-aided tribal invasion of the state, the part of which is still under the “enemy occupation.” The term enemy occupation is for Pakistan that sits on the territory of the state without any legal sanction. Even the UN resolution, that Islamabad keeps harping on all the time, asked it to vacate the territory in full. Minorities are disappointed, however, and there are multiple reasons for that. We can refer to four dimensions, that are interconnected to one another. Each one of them has an unsettling discourse in its store. First, there are shades of a class struggle between the privileged and the underprivileged sections. The underprivileged versus the rest struggle is bound to roll on. The SC/ ST / RBA are spread across the state. The privileged classes are deemed to be the upper-castes Hindus, and Muslims who don't have any caste system. The reserved category members always feel discriminated against. They accuse the state government of not giving them their due quota in services. There are more than 47 per cent of them in the services. Their fear is that if one rule could be struck down, there is no guarantee that their rights would not be harmed further. The Gujjars are already sore. They feel that despite being one-fourth of the total 12.5 million population of the state, they have not been given due political space. Article 370 doesn't offer any guarantees to the underprivileged sections, not even to the minorities in this Muslim-majority state. The state constitution doesn't even have the word secular in it. Second, there is the communal angle. The minorities and the underprivileged sections come mostly from the Buddhist-dominated Ladakh, the Gujjars from Rajouri and Poonch and the Scheduled Castes and RBA from Jammu's plains, Ladakh and Kargil. Incidentally, they form the ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities. The Gujjars are Muslims, but they have a language and ethnicity of their own. The Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs and Christians are in a minority and often complain that their share in the government services is shrinking. Thirdly, the premier political party of the state, the National Conference, the People's Democratic Party, a large section of the Congress and even the CPI-M are tilted towards their vote bank —the Muslims. The minorities never figure in their scheme of things. The BJP, in its current alliance of supplication to the PDP, has been unable either to demonstrate a counter-narrative or to make Kashmir-centric parties see merit in secularism or in accommodating the minorities on a larger canvas. A vast majority of Muslims have a great sense of accommodation with the minorities. After the 1990s, when the Kashmiri Pandits fled the Valley and Hindus got uprooted from the mountainous areas in Jammu region, the youth over the 25 years is more interested in stalling the economic competition. Their feelings are rooted in reaction to what happens in other parts of the country, like the lynching in Dadri. They have become very possessive of their religious, physical, social and economic space. Everybody is deemed as an “outsider”. With some political groups pitching for the strengthening of the semi-autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir and the BJP having taken its hands off this controversial issue for the sake of power, the minorities are reeling under the fear of losing their identity. They have seen how a judgment by Jammu bench of High Court on the implementation of the beef ban law resulted in the ghastly reaction of slaughtering of bovine animals in public. The gory pictures were uploaded on social media, which led to the torching of a truck in Udhampur. Two Kashmiri Muslim truckers were severely injured and one of them succumbed to his injuries in Delhi. This provokes a justified sense of outrage and anger. Fourth, the fringe elements among Hindu fundamentalists may get revived as a counter to the growing radicalism in the Valley. The beef controversy has already shown how fragile the state is in communal, regional and sub-regional terms. There is a way out where the reality of the special status is not blown as a victory of the Muslims and denunciation of other residents of the state, fuelling their sense of insecurity. The minorities should also become part of the political and constitutional architecture of the state. The doors for dialogue should be opened. The majority and minority should look for common ground. Wisdom demands that the rights and interests of the underprivileged are guarded with irrevocable guarantees. If certain amendments are needed to assure both the majority and minorities, those should be undertaken with a broader objective of forging a consensus based on the respect for law and not just a numerical majority. That would harmonise the relations between communities and regions and sub-regions. ajoshi57@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:26:00.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
