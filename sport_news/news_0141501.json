Cozens on October 5,   \nIn another strong performance despite being at less than full strength, the John Jay girls cross country team took first place in its division at Saturday’s Brewster Bear Classic at Brewster High School. \nThe Indians were without two of their top runners (and senior captains) in reigning section champ Gemma Nuttall and Gabby Yablonski, but still managed to dominate, with six of the top 12 finishers in the race. They placed first as a team with 35 points, followed by Briarcliff (71), Mamaroneck (104) and 10 other teams. \nThe John Jay boys were resting their top two runners, seniors Eion Nohilly (the reigning county champ) and Lucas Smallige, but still managed to finish fourth in the Varsity 1 race, out of 15 teams. \n“Overall it was a great result for us, especially because we rested some of our top runners on the boys and girls team,” said Coach Tommy Nohilly. “The (team) ran extremely well, with personal bests being set for almost everyone on the team. The hard work over the last six weeks is beginning to pay off and we are looking forward to continuing to impress into the championship portion of the season.” \nThat part of the season begins on Tuesday (Oct. 6) with the Conference I League D championships at Bowdoin Park. \nOn Saturday, freshman Pippa Nuttall was again the Indians’ top female finisher, placing second overall in the Varsity 2 race in a time of 18:30.55 for the 5K course. Junior Kathryn Nohilly was fourth in 18:55.61, followed by junior Brooke Nohilly (ninth, 19:37.06), freshman Cameron Crawford (11th, 19:48.0) and junior Danielle Femia (12th, 19:53.57) to round out the team’s top five. Freshman Kendall Degenhard was 23th (20:42.13) and senior Emily Downs was 33rd (21:25.3). \nLauren Chapey of Mamaroneck was the race winner in a time of 17:56.72. \nCoach Nohilly said he was encouraged by the effort of his daughter, Brooke, who ran a tough race after battling illness in the last few races. \n“With Gemma back and Brooke beginning feel better, the girls are going to be a force to be reckoned with leading into the championships,” he said. “Our girls are looking forward to a strong showing this week at the league meet Tuesday and Manhattan College on Saturday. Finally, for the first time this season, we will be able to line up our whole team and be at full strength.” \nThe John Jay boys’ fourth place in the Varsity 1 race was impressive considering that, with Nohilly and Smallige out, and senior Dan Neuberger still coming back from an injury, the Indians had a lineup of runners all new to varsity this season. \nSophomore newcomer Charlie Stewart led the way with a 12th-place finish in a time of 16:48.48 \n“Charlie is really beginning to show some big improvements. If he can continue his progression, he will make a huge impact for the boys team,” said Coach Nohilly. \nAnother first-year sophomore, Jack Buckley, was the team’s second finisher (25th overall) in 17:36.61, followed by eighth grader Will Kennedy (27th, 17:39.39) and juniors Ryan Jenkins (28th, 17:44.03) and Will Gaglioti (38th, 18:21.69) to round out the top five. Completing the finishers were junior Jackson Mingle (41st, 18:24.85) and sophomore Ed Soriano (65th, 19:08.59). \nJohn Jay’s depth was evident in the fact that both the boys and girls teams finished second in their JV races. \nIn the girls JV race, freshman Athena Ohnemus led the way, finishing fifth in a time of 21:04.23, with fellow ninth grader Caroline Williams close behind in fifth place (21:15.39). The next two finishers were freshman Libby Gressin was (12th, 22:16.57) and Mikaela Marcotullion (18th, 23:00.91), while sophomore Elenor Krellenstein was 35th in 25:34.86. \nIn the boys JV 2 race, Neuberger led the way as he was a close second in a time of 17:35.05, a fraction of a second behind race winner Dan Rechtorovic of Valley Central. \n“Daniel, who has been nursing an injury, showed some grit to push through and lead the JV boys,” said Coach Nohilly. \nSophomore Brendan Carroll finished eighth overall in 18:18.58, and freshman Brandon Buscema was 12th (18:44.18), while the team’s top five was rounded out by sophomore Kobe Weston (20th, 19:02.16), senior Cameron Casey (21st, 19:02.6) and freshman Colin Morefield (26th, 19:09.85). \nCompleting the top seven were junior Josh Rubin (30th, 19:22.69) and freshman Ryan Comstock (37th, 19:42.56). They were followed by sophomore Greg Newman (38th, 19:43.55), freshman Mackenzie Rukaniec (43rd, 19:49.1), sophomore Justin Gelwicks (46th, 19:53.63), junior Zachary Kaplan (53rd, 20:06.74), sophomore Mills Reed (64th, 20:27.21), senior Matt Salton (70th, 20:50.68), sophomore Samuel Murphy (76th, 20:58.23), sophomore Brendan Oates (79th, 21:00.02), junior Greg Kaplan (81st, 21:01.94), freshman Liam Elkins (89th, 21:14.09), freshman Bryce Stepaniuk (97th, 21:45.54), freshman Orion Cummings (98th, 21:46.58), freshman Ian Wiatric (109th, 22:16.85), senior Liam Kelly (114th, 22:32.42), senior Nick Van-Slyck (115th, 22:38.72) and junior Corneil Smith (133rd, 25:50.74).
