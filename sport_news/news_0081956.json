They won’t always be the top-4 in CPP value, but, promise to provide value at their relative cost. By default, our cost/point calculations are developed using Draft Kings ‘ pricing strategy, but, you can toggle between DK and Fanduel using the overall table below the picks. Week 5 DFS Plays: Quarterback \nJay Cutler – Draft Kings Salary: $5,300 – My Rank: QB10 – Salary Rank: QB19 – Cost/Point: $287 Hey, you. Pick me. Says Jay Cutler, who’ll draw a cake matchup against the Chiefs (Photo: Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images North America). \nEven with Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal looking iffy to face the Chiefs, Cutler presents a solid value this week. He played well a week ago against the Raiders and now has a road date with a KC team that hasn’t allowed either 300 passing yards or multiple scores in a game to opposing QBs this year (often both). The Chiefs have yielded a league high 11 scores along with the second most passing yards in the league. The matchup is ripe, and the price palatable. If you’re looking to save a few dollars at the QB position, he’s your man. \nPeyton Manning – Draft Kings Salary: $7,000 – My Rank: QB2 – Salary Rank: QB4 – Cost/Point: $321 \nI’ve been as hard as anyone on Manning through the first month of the season, and, he doesn’t look like the same Quarterback he was even when he first arrived in Denver. Nevertheless, he’ll draw the Raiders this week and should find the matchup easy to exploit. Oakland has given up 1,275 yards through four games, well over 300 per game and Manning has shown he still has an aptitude to exploit a soft matchup. Oakland has enough holes, including with their linebackers in coverage, that Manning can find some chunk plays in the passing game this week. Week 5 DFS Plays: Running Back \nDion Lewis – Draft Kings Salary: $4,800 – My Rank: RB5 – Salary Rank: RB19 – Cost/Point: $212 \nLewis was barely needed in the second half the last time New England took the field, and yet he’s still averaged 15 touches per game through the first month of the season. This week, he and the pats head to Dallas to take on a Cowboys team that has given up 32 receptions (that’s eight per game) and 333 yards through the air to opposing backs. With reinforcements coming on defense this week, expect them to ratchet up the pressure leaving Brady to look to get the ball out even quicker, including to his outlet back in the flat. Count on solid point per reception contributions from Lewis with a solid likelihood of running his scoring streak to three games. \nTodd Gurley – Draft Kings Salary: $4,300 – My Rank: RB6 – Salary Rank: RB30 – Cost/Point: $259 \nGetting rolling at home against a division rival is a different proposition from heading to Lambeau and putting your team on the back, but, what matters with Gurley this week is that he’s being priced as a backup but is now earning a significant workload. The rookie RB played 68% of the team’s snaps last week and stood up well to the workload, looking quick to accelerate on the edges and powerful enough to make room running through the middle. How long St. Louis will be able to commit to the run this week remains to be seen, but, when they do they’ll do it through Gurley, whose 148 yards from his first extended look would play very well at $4,300. Week 5 DFS Plays: Wide Receiver \nLeonard Hankerson – Draft Kings Salary: $4,000 – My Rank: WR26 – Salary Rank: WR44 – Cost/Point: $275 \nIf you forgot about revenge games, go watch Andre Johnson ‘s Thursday Nighter back and then get fired up for Hankerson’s hook up with Washington. Or, don’t. In any event, Hankerson has taken on a major role in a productive Falcons offense. He’s been targeted at least six times in each of the last three games and serves as a clear number two to Julio Jones , which could be a productive play against Washington’s 10th most generous WR defense. \nKamar Aiken – Draft Kings Salary: $3,800 – My Rank: WR33 – Salary Rank: WR45 – Cost/Point: $329 \nOpportunity falls in Aiken’s lap this week, with Steve Smith and Crockett Gillmore down for the count Aiken looks to be Joe Flacco ‘s primary read in Week 5. Baltimore draws an under-performing Browns secondary that will either be without Joe Haden or will see him in a limited fashion. He should see plenty of targets, leading to enough receptions to leave him with a solid floor and the potential to find the end zone this week. Week 5 DFS Plays: Tight End \nOwen Daniels – Draft Kings Salary: $2,700 – My Rank: TE4 – Salary Rank: TE21 – Cost/Point: $216 \nI’ve already made note of Oakland’s issues defending the middle of the field, and the six scores they’ve given up to the position are at least double every other team (except for the Steelers, who yielded three to Rob Gronkowski in Week 1). 32 receptions and 388 yards also lead the league. Oakland simply can’t cover the position, by virtue of both scheme and coverage talent in their linebacking corps. Count on major contributions from Daniels this week as part of a productive Denver passing game. Week 5 DFS Plays: Defense \nNew York Giants – Draft Kings Salary: $2,900 – My Rank: DST1- Salary Rank: DST11 – Cost/Point: $197 \nWith five interceptions in the last two weeks and just two touchdowns thrown on the season, Kaepernick is ripe for the picking. San Francisco has scored a combined 10 points in their last two games, while the Giants have played stronger defense through four weeks this season. They’ve had just five sacks this year, but have produced eight turnovers in their four outings.
