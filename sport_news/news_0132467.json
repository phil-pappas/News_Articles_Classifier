Each will consist of six teams, and the winner of each will qualify for Rio de Janeiro. \nGermany, Turkey and Israel have not qualified to play in the tournaments and would only gain a place if they are chosen to host. FIBA set a Nov. 11 deadline to submit details of all the bids and said evaluations would take place afterward. \nFIBA identified the player and fan experience, and chances for financial success as criteria to determine which countries will be picked. \nNine teams have already secured spots in the 12-team Olympic field.
