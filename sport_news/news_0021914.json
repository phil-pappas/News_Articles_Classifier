(Photo: File photo by Manny Crisostomo, DFP) \nMichigan State has ruined a number of Michigan football seasons. \nBut none like 1984. \nThe No. 13 Wolverines were 3-1 entering their game against the unranked Spartans, and in his first year as the starting quarterback, Jim Harbaugh’s confidence was growing weekly. \nThen, with the Wolverines facing a 13-7 deficit in the third quarter, U-M tailback Jamie Morris fumbled. As Harbaugh dove for the ball, he was hit by MSU’s Thomas Tyree, who recovered the loose ball. \nHarbaugh suffered a broken arm. His replacement, Russell Rein, threw an interception soon afterward. The Wolverines went on to lose the game, 19-7, and finish the season 6-6. It was the only time in his 21 seasons as U-M coach that Bo Schembechler did not have a winning record. \n“I remember Harbs being disappointed, the coaching staff being disappointed,” said U-M tackle John (Jumbo) Elliott, himself a first-year starter at the time. “We had a team that was just starting to come together.” \nA few days after the game, Schembechler told reporters: “We trained Jim Harbaugh for three years, and he was just at the point to take us to another step. Now we’ve got to start all over.” \nEven now, 31 years later, Elliott recalls how devastating that was. \n“(Harbaugh) was our dynamic leader on offense,” Elliott said. “He was a playmaker. It started with him, and to lose him and not have the same caliber ready to go ... \n“We had some good guys who stepped up as best they could, but we didn’t have a clone of Jimmy Harbaugh. That definitely sidetracked us and maybe even slowed us down a little bit.” \nAt least for a year. \nWith Harbaugh the next two seasons, the Wolverines went 21-3-1, including 31-0 and 27-6 victories over MSU. They finished No. 2 in the nation in 1985 and played in the Rose Bowl in 1986. \nNow, as Harbaugh prepares for his first Michigan State game as U-M’s coach, his team is again at home and again ranked highly (No. 12 this season). But he’s downplaying the rivalry and that devastating moment. \n“It’s in the past,” Harbaugh said Monday. “Sometimes it hurts, and that hurt. You can run from it or learn from it.” Harbaugh, U-M players de-emphasizing MSU rivalry \nFor Elliott, who was born in Lake Ronkonkoma, N.Y., the passion of the U-M/MSU rivalry never resonated with him. \n“Playing at Michigan, we were always somebody’s Super Bowl,” Elliott said. “Whether we were playing Michigan State, Wisconsin, Minnesota or Little Sisters of the Poor, there was some kind of trophy involved — a jug, an axe. Something was always on the line playing Michigan. We always looked at them as an in-state (rival). I played for the (New York) Giants for a lot of years and the Jets for a lot of years, and it was kind of like early in (my) Giants tenure. We kind of looked at the Jets like a little brother in-state, and it was the same thing. Not to quote (former U-M tailback) Mike Hart, but it was kind of the same thing. ‘You guys should know your place and shut up.’ ” \nWith Elliott at 6-feet-7 and a playing weight over 300 pounds — hence his nickname Jumbo — no one is likely to make a gesture like MSU coach Mark Dantonio did about Hart’s height after Hart’s 2007 comments about the rivalry. \nElliott’s playing record was 2-2 against the Spartans. When he was a fifth-year senior in 1987, U-M lost, 17-11, as quarterback Demetrius Brown threw seven interceptions. “Even with seven or eight picks, we were in the game on the final drive,” he remembered. \nBut it was a reminder of the difference in having Harbaugh at the helm. \n“He used to run the option. He could throw the ball down the field. He could throw the fast pass. He could throw it deep,” Elliott said. “He had a penchant for big plays. He could nickel and dime, but he could make the big play on a moment’s notice.” \nWhile Elliott never saw MSU as a threat, he still admits the games got testy. \n“My approach to Michigan State is they (were) just dirty,” Elliott said. “The assessment was it was going to be a physical, hard, nasty game, and even if we beat them 35-7 or whatever, it was going to be that kind of game. It was going to be chippy. It was the kind of game where you don’t want to be standing around the pile lollygagging, because someone’s going to clean the pile up. And if you’re close to the boundary, you don’t want to relax, because someone’s going to go ahead and take a shot and make sure you’re out of bounds. \n“If you’re a quarterback, it’s game on. I remember we were upset and not happy (about Harbaugh’s injury), but I don’t remember the details of it. When you play your bigger rivals, it can lead to things getting a little bit on edge or across the line a little bit.” \nSeeing Harbaugh return as a coach thrills Elliott, especially he knows him so well. They saw each other in February when Elliott visited Ann Arbor, which reminded Elliott of what has been missing for the past seven years at U-M. \nWhen Elliott and his former teammates would talk about the team over the past decade, it would drive them crazy, especially how the offensive line was manhandled by MSU in recent years. \nHe joked: “I should send Michigan a bill. I think I broke four or five big screen TVs.” \nBut watching the games was not funny as he was stunned and bothered by the minus-48 yards rushing against MSU in 2013 and the minus-21 the next week against Nebraska. \nNow, with Harbaugh, he said he’s “ecstatic” and sees the growth in the offensive line. \nDoes that mean a victory Saturday in the Big House? Not necessarily. \nBut despite his own little-brother perspective in the 1980s, he respects the Spartans now, primarily because of Dantonio. \n“Michigan State has a really terrific coach, probably an understatement by me,” Elliott said. “But he’s a chippy little guy. He makes me want to suit up and hit somebody. I might show up. That says he’s a great coach — he’s under my skin.” \nEven three decades later, these games still rile up the former players. \nSome are glad to remember, fueling their emotions. Others, like Harbaugh, have another focus. \nThis weekend’s only guarantee: Harbaugh’s arm can’t affect the outcome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:38:00.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
