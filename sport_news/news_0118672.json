It’s a tough play for him it’s very, very hard,” Lasorda told The Post. “But I don’t think he was trying to hurt him.”\nBut the former Brooklyn Dodgers hurler added: “He [Utley] seemed like he was trying to break up the double play and that’s what his intentions were but it looked like he had to go out of his way to get him.”\nLasorda managed the Dodgers from the end of 1976 through midseason in 1996.\nHe was at the helm when Los Angeles last won an NL pennant — beating the Mets — and World Series title, way back in 1988.\nRuben Tejada is upended by Chase Utley in Game 2 of the NLDS.

They give catchers protection, right?” Lasorda said. “What about those middle infielders? What kind of protection do you want to give them?”\nHe declined to question MLB’s move to suspend Utley .\n“You’re asking the wrong guy. I don’t second guess people,” he said. “They do the best they can I guess and it’s not going to impress everybody. Some may like it some may not like it.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chase utley ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb ,  new york mets ,  nlds ,  ruben tejada ,  tommy lasorda", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:32:30.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
