Fathy is yet to receive a reply.\n\"The problem isn’t with Freeman, but rather that service agencies [facilitating filming in Cairo] should have applied for a filming permit, especially given that the film includes content related to Egypt’s image, and also given that the film will be translated into 42 languages, and screened in a number of foreign countries,” Fathy explained.\n\"But unfortunately, they [service agencies] did not address the Censorship Authority regarding this matter, which they should have done according to the Egyptian law.\"\n\"Even if the State Information Service had an idea regarding the visit, it is the Censorship Authority’s role to issue filming permits.\"\n\"While the State Information Service must give its consent to the film crew’s presence in Cairo, our role is to issue a permit for the film to be shot in Egypt.\n\"We were informed that the actor filmed in El-Moez Street, that he visited El-Hussein area, in addition to a [scheduled] Luxor trip,\" Fathy continued pointing to the fact that many details related to the shooting remain to be verified.\nAs for critique directed to the Censorship Authority regarding its stance on the matter, Fathy explained that “the issue is not related to Freeman per se, for he is an actor loved by many. But rather relates to a country’s image, which [the protection of] is amongst my responsibilities, and that the issue should not spur a debate.”\nHowever according to head of the State Information Service, Salah El-Din Abd El-Sadek, everything has been cleared by the film’s crew.\nAbd El-Sadek told Al-Watan, one of Egypt’s daily papers that “National Geographic Channel [the film’s production company] has indeed applied for a permit and has received it about four months ago.”\nEl-Sadek also stressed on the fact that the State Information Service is the sole body in Egypt tasked with issuing permits for documentary films, while Egypt’s Censorship Authority is responsible for issuing permits to fiction films.\nThe 78-year old Freeman actor arrived in Cairo from Turkey on Sunday.\nLast June, National Geographic Channel announced that Freeman would host and be the executive producer of The Story of God that explores religions and religious rituals. The documentary will be released in 2016.\nFor more arts and culture news and updates, follow Ahram Online Arts and Culture on Twitter at @AhramOnlineArts and on Facebook at Ahram Online: Arts & Culture", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AhramOnlineArts", "https://www.facebook.com/ahramonlinearts"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:36:19.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
