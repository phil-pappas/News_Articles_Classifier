Besides exacting some revenge on the reigning Corn Belt Conference champion, Pontiac was able to taint U-High’s Homecoming while also winning for the sixth time to guarantee a game for Week 10. The 16-9 victory pushed the Tribe’s season mark to 6-2. PTHS also finishes 6-1 in the Corn Belt for second place. U-High dropped to 6-2 on the season and 5-2 in the conference. “We lost to these guys big the last two years and I we were sick and tired of it,” PTHS senior quarterback-defensive back Seth Cunningham said. “We came here on their Homecoming to bring it to them. “We’re really excited. Our team is pumped, now we just have to move on to Kankakee.” Cunningham directed two scoring drives in the second half that broke a 3-3 halftime tie and put the Indians in the driver’s seat. The key play of the evening came on Pontiac’s second possession. Cunningham connected with Mikey Carroll on a slant for a 33-yard gain that put the ball on the Pioneers’ 28-yard line. It was this play that seemed to stun U-High and created a loud cheer from the small group of PTHS followers. Cunningham hit Levi Ransom for an eight-yard gain and a first down to the U-High 17. Cunningham found Colton Walsberg two plays later for an 11-yard touchdown. Noah Sandoval kicked the extra point for a 10-3 PTHS lead. “We knew we needed to step up in the second half,” Cunningham said. “In the second half, we brought it to them and we played real Pontiac football.” Pontiac football in the last 25 years has been a complementary effort on both sides of the ball. The offense helps the defense and visa versa. Leading 10-3, the defense, which was already establishing a classic bend-but-don’t-break stand, was able to continue to stymie the Pioneers. It was Cunningham who came up with a big play that helped the offense produce its second touchdown. Cunningham was able to snare a deflected pass for an interception at the U-High 47 on the second play of the fourth quarter. It took the Indians 11 plays to cover those 47 yards and go up 16-3. The drive also took 4:14 off the clock. It ended when Cunningham improvised on a designed roll out. Going to his left, Cunningham was looking to throw but was about ready to tuck it and run. The U-High defense sensed a run and started to close in on the PTHS signal-caller. Page 2 of 2 - Levi Ransom was able to break behind the defense and was all alone in the end zone. Cunningham tossed the ball over the defense to Ransom for the TD. “It was a flood play and it busted up a bit,” Cunningham said of the touchdown play. “I was going to run it but they came up at me and (Ransom) was wide open. He’s always finds ways to get open.” “Seth was able to scramble and make some plays,” PTHS head coach Buck Casson said. Pontiac put together one more long drive but it only took 4:17 off the clock, giving U-High the ball at its 24 with 1:12 remaining. The Pioneers scored on a 26-yard pass play as time ran out. “We had an awesome defensive effort,” Casson said. “I didn’t want them to score … (but) if they’re running a route that’s 30 yards downfield, that’s going to take five seconds. I had no problem with that whatsoever.” Pontiac played a lot of defense in the first half, but most of it was while holding a 3-0 advantage. The Indians drove to the U-High 2-yard line before settling for a 24-yard field goal from Noah Sandoval to cap the first PTHS offensive possession. U-High then had a possession that lasted 6:15 and resulted in a missed field goal. The big play was a 14-yard pickup on a scramble by punter Austin Galindo after a bad snap and chase that nearly resulted in a loss deep in Pioneer territory. The last U-High possession of the first half ate the last 4:59 off the clock and resulted in a 36-yard field goal from Ryan Poland as time ran out. Two pass interference penalties against the Indians helped the drive continue. “I felt like we played pretty solid defense, overall,” Casson said. “We had some calls that extended some of their drives. “That’s sometimes a victory for the defense, to be in the red zone and we held them to two field goal (tries).” Pontiac ran just 15 plays in the first half and finished with 208 yards on 47 plays for the game. Vaughn Hobart rushed 18 times for 64 yards. He also had a catch for 27. Cunningham threw for 119 yards and two touchdowns on 8 of 19 passing. Carroll had 44 yards on two catches and Ransom caught four passes for 37 yards. The PTHS defense held U-High’s star back JoJo Hughes to 88 yards on 23 carries. Doug Holmes was 13 of 29 passing for 153 yards and a TD. Overall, the Pioneers had 296 yards on 64 plays. Pontiac will host Kankakee for Senior Night next week and then plan for the postseason.
