(Photo: File) \nEAST LANSING – The Michigan State hockey team is shooting for at least 100 goals this season. \nThe Spartans scored 83 last season in 35 games. Four of the top five goal-scorers return, led by senior captain Michael Ferrantino (12 goals). \n“We will defend well,” Michigan State coach Tom Anastos told reporters at media day Wednesday at Munn Ice Arena. “If our offense can come like I think it will, then I think we can win a lot of games.” \nThe Spartans ranked second in the country last season in blocked shots per game (16.71) and return All-America goaltender Jake Hildebrand (2.18 goals-against average, .930 save percentage). \nMackenzie MacEachern, a junior, and Ryan Keller, a senior, look to contribute more after each chipped in 11 goals last season. \n“Mackenzie MacEachern has really been a catalyst for our team, and he had an incredible off-season,” Anastos said. “He’s come in here in excellent condition. I think he’s taking on more leadership, and so far in the small sample we have, he’s really thriving with that. \n“He’s always worked hard, but I think he’s working smarter, and in the short practices that we’ve had so far, I can see him being attentive to details in his game that sometimes he blew over before.” \nAnastos said he thinks other returning players like Villiam Haag (five goals, 10 points), Thomas Ebbing (four goals, 11 points), Matt DeBlouw (eight goals, 13 points) and JT Stenglein (two goals, four points) can play bigger roles offensively. \nHaag, from Gothenburg, Sweden, was disappointed t he didn’t contribute more offensively last season. \n“I’m that kind of person that maybe I think too much when I play, and when it doesn’t maybe go my way, I get frustrated,” Haag. “That’s also something you need to learn if you want to take the next step. You need to be able to handle that.” \nHaag has scored 13 goals in 70 games for the Spartans over his first two seasons. He is hoping to have a breakout season as a junior like fellow countryman Viktor Stalberg had at Vermont before going on to play in the NHL. \nStalberg scored 17 goals in his first two seasons at Vermont, then scored 24 as a junior in 2008-09. \nBIG BLOW: Anastos revealed that freshman defenseman Jerad Rosburg had knee surgery on Tuesday and won’t play this season. It’s the second knee surgery for Rosburg, who spent the past two seasons in the U.S. Hockey League with Sioux City. \n““They’ve tried immobilization. They’ve tried rest. They’ve tried stem-cell injections,” Anastos said. “They’ve tried different things, and it hasn’t worked. … It was decided by all the parties involved, and Jared and his family as well, that this was the right step to take. And now is the right time to do it, so time is on our side.” \nThey were hoping to avoid surgery, but Anastos said it got to a point where “ultimately it was determined there wasn’t going to be enough progress without having surgery.” \nWith Rosburg out, that leaves seven healthy defensemen. \n“That thins us out back there in a way that we weren’t really expecting,” Anastos said. \nAnastos said the injury creates an opportunity for Chris Knudson , a junior who is coming off an ACL injury last season. Knudson played in four games last season and 13 games as a freshman. \nAPPLETON’S IMPACT: Look for forward Mason Appleton to make an impact as a freshman. Anastos said Appleton, who was drafted in the sixth round by Winnipeg this past June, has been practicing on a line with MacEachern. Anastos hasn’t yet decided whether to play Appleton at center or not. \nAppleton had 12 goals and 40 points in 54 games last season for Tri-City (USHL). \n“I think at center he’ll have the puck on his stick a little bit more, which gives him the chance to make that impact,” Anastos said. “It’s just that I don’t want to force him to bite off more than he can chew too early. We’re going to kind of find our way with that. He’s going to have a lot of opportunity to play.” \nKey dates \nSunday: Exhibition vs. Western Ontario, 4:05 p.m. \nOct. 9: Season opener vs. Maine in Ice Breaker Tournament in Portland, Maine, 8 p.m. \nOct. 22: Home opener vs. Lake Superior State, 7:05 p.m. \nDec. 29-30: Great Lakes Invitational at Joe Louis Arena. \nJan. 8: Vs.
