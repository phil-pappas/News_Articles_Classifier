And for whatever reason, he did it by telling reporters that he hopes to “come out guns blazing” on Sunday when Dallas hosts the Patriots . It was a poor choice of words, to say the least.\nHardy then proceeded to joke around about Tom Brady and his wife Gisele Bündchen . “I hope she comes to the game,” he said. “I hope her sister comes to the game.”\nHardy’s approach to being back in the lineup struck many sports fans as odd, if not downright disrespectful, and it didn’t sit well with a lot of people. One of those people was Fox Sports 1 host Katie Nolan , who scrapped a bunch of segments that she had planned for her Garbage Time show last night to address Hardy’s comments. She questioned his “guns blazing” Quote: , referred to him as “human garbage,” and called out both the NFL and the Cowboys for allowing his commentary to air on their respective websites.\n“Greg Hardy had to pretend to respect women for 12 minutes, just 12 minutes , and he couldn’t even do that,” she said. “And what’s worse is no one stopped him. They let him go on about girlfriends and guns and posted video of it on DallasCowboys.com because who fucking cares? Women won’t see it.”\nCheck out Nolan's excellent takedown in the clip above.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com .\n[ via For The Win ]", "external_links": ["http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/katie-nolan-calls-greg-hardy-a-garbage-human"], "published": "2015-10-08T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:07:52.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
