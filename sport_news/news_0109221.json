He then raced out to a 5-1 lead in the tiebreak and held on for the win.\nCilic finished with 50 winners, more than double his Chinese opponent.\nIn other matches, John Isner smashed 20 aces to defeat France's Adrian Mannarino 6-1, 6-2 in 45 minutes.\nThe 13th-seeded American lost only six points on his first serve and saved the only break point he faced in the second set.\nAustralia's Nick Kyrgios hit 13 aces and saved all five break points he faced to beat Andreas Haider-Maurer 6-3, 6-2. He will next face Japanese star Kei Nishikori, who had a first-round bye.\n\"Obviously Kei, he's one of the best players in the world right now,\" Kyrgios said. \"He's got unbelievable returns. He's a great athlete. He's playing well. So I know what I have to do.\"\nCroatia's Ivo Karlovic advanced with a 6-4, 7-6 (6) win over Jeremy Chardy and will next play Rafael Nadal, who is coming off a runner-up finish at last week's China Open in Beijing.\nJo-Wilfried Tsonga, the 16th seed, also reached the second round with a 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-2 win over Spain's Tommy Robredo 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-2, and Feliciano Lopez topped Russian qualifier Andrey Kuznetsov 6-4, 7-6 (3).\nTop-seeded Novak Djokovic will play Martin Klizan in his opening match after the Slovakian defeated China's Zhang Ze 7-6 (8), 6-2.\nDjokovic will try to win back-to-back titles at the China Open and Shanghai Masters for the third time following his triumph last week in Beijing.
