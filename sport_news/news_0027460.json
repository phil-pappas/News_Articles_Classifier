Following a United States Justice Department investigation into alleged widespread FIFA corruption, Blatter announced in June that he would step down once elections to appoint his successor, provisionally set for early 2016, had been carried out.\nPlatini had been one of the frontrunners to succeed Blatter, but Thursday's suspension leaves the Frenchman's bid in tatters.\nThe decision of FIFA's ethics committee comes in the wake of a pending criminal investigation by Switzerland's legal authorities, investigating payments made from Blatter to Platini in 2011 – for work carried out between 1998 and 2002 – totaling two million Swiss francs ($2.06 million).\nFOR THE WIN\nFIFA Ethics Committee finally suspends Sepp Blatter, but will anything really change?\nBlatter's interim replacement is Issa Hayatou, of Cameroon – who was disciplined by the International Olympic Committee in 2011 for accepting a payment as part of an alleged bribery scandal.\nThe Cameroonian, who has a serious kidney illness that requires regular dialysis sessions, is currently in Yaounde and is expected to travel to Zurich immediately.\nThe interim leader of UEFA will be Spanish federation head Angel Maria Villar, who remains at risk of being sanctioned from the FIFA ethics committee in its investigation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding contests.\nBlatter's suspension brings a sudden halt to a 40-year career that had survived waves of scandals until he was placed under criminal investigation.\nBlatter's lawyer, Richard Cullen, said the ethics committee failed to follow procedure and based its decision on a \"misunderstanding.\"\n\"The attorney general in Switzerland ... opened an investigation but brought no charge against the president,\" Cullen said in a statement. \"In fact, the prosecutors will be obliged by law to dismiss the case if their investigation, barely two weeks old, does not establish sufficient evidence.\n\"President Blatter looks forward to the opportunity to present evidence that will demonstrate that he did not engage in any misconduct, criminal or otherwise.\"\nThere was no immediate comment from Platini.\nContributing: The Associated Press\n37 CONNECT 43 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543174859001_thumbnail-for-video-4543110470001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1Rw3fJ5", "http://embed.5min.com/PlayerSeed/?sid=1789&width=100&height=auto&playList=519139934&responsive=true&ratio=1&align=1&pgType=console&pgTypeId=editVideo-overviewTab-grabCodeBtn&ver=1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/47800c1eb37096318449e2ea7743a2c2e109a3b6/r=300/https/i2.wp.com/usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/afp_545143285_76566400.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798842229857461-USATSI-8612064.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RvH9X6&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RvH9X6&text=FIFA%20suspends%20Sepp%20Blatter%20and%20Michel%20Platini%20for%2090%20days&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b53ec7d06fd004992e19713e3763bfc6442543a/c=333-41-1024-561&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798842229857461-USATSI-8612064.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543174861001_video-still-for-video-4543110470001.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543174861001_video-still-for-video-4543110470001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c326cd5b70382ee0c732c4a31f0d71e32a2a1b67/r=500x282/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798842229857461-USATSI-8612064.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543174861001_video-still-for-video-4543110470001.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:05:50.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
