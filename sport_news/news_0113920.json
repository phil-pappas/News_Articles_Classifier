Yet we want those elected members to always remember that their first responsibility is to “represent” we, the citizens. \nThe decisions that are to be made by the council and implemented by city staff need to be transparent and collaborative with the citizens. We want the same standards applied to all, regardless of whom you know at City Hall. That attitude must be the “hallmark” of how the people’s representatives govern. \nTo make this happen, I urge you to join me in voting for Tom Hornish, Christie Malchow and Ramiro Valderrama for City Council. \nMary Jo Kahler \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:33:08.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
