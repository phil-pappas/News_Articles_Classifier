We will see what kind of men we have,” said Jarin, right after the Red Lions rolled past the Mapua Cardinals, 78-65 on Tuesday. \nThe Chiefs, meanwhile, are expected to go all out for a repeat over the Red Lions, whom they beat 84-88, in the first round. \nThe Red Lions currently share first place with the Letran Knights on 12-4 records, and a victory will put them back on top. But should they lose against the Chiefs, the Red Lions will have to get past the Letran Knights on Tuesday to still earn the twice-to-beat incentive. \nThe Chiefs, who are currently tied with the Mapua Cardinals at 10-6, will have to do it the hard way to make it to the next phase by winning all their remaining game. \n“It’s still in our hands, but we have to do our part and win all our games,” said Arellano coach Jerry Codinera. \nLyceum and College of St. Benilde, meanwhile, will meet in a non-bearing contest at 2 p.m. COMMENT DISCLAIMER: Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by MST.ph.
