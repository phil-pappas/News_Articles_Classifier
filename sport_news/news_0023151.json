They all point to that game as the turning point for this franchise. \nThey might have a new turning point.\nDown 6-2 in the top of the 8th, with Astros fans screaming in anticipation, Kansas City put together an unlikely rally, scoring 5 runs for a 7-6 lead, and ultimately, a 9-6 victory. The governor of Texas even tweeted congratulations to the Astros on advancing to the American League Championship series.\nIt took good hitting, aggressive base running and some strange hops, but the Royals stunned Houston.\nThe guys in orange looked a lot like the guys in Oakland green and gold, as a dead and buried Royals team scratched out hit after hit, using a poor defensive play (last year it was a deep ball misplayed by two A's outfielders- this year a ball skipping past Houston shortstop Carlos Correa). In both games. there was a look of disbelief on the Royals opponent's faces.It said, \"Hey, we had this! What happened!\"\nWith ace Josh Lester on the mound, KC found a way to rally against Oakland, and they did the same thing against a trio of Astro pitchers in that star-crossed 8th inning.\n10 batters came to the plate. The first five men got base hits.\nThe supreme confidence Houston's players, manager and fans have exhibited all series disappeared. There was  no more celebrating in the Astro dugout. There were no more shots of act pitcher Dallas Keuchel smiling and laughing. In their place: long faces, shocked faces, just like in the Oakland dugout last year.\nIn both cases, reliever Luke Gregerson played a key role in helping push the Royals ahead.\nWho knows where this will lead. Perhaps the Astros will come back and beat the Royals in Game 5 at Kauffman Stadium Wednesday night. Maybe this dramatic rally will do nothing but postpone the Astros celebration.\nBut, whatever happens, Royals fans have another great memory to savor.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
