No, no, no. I don't know what's going on, seriously,\" Nadal insisted. \"We had the issue that we had in Hamburg, and that's it. No problems.\" \nFognini also said the Hamburg row was in the past but he indicated ill-feeling may remain against Nadal's team and in particular his coach and uncle, Toni, who was seen angrily gesticulating courtside. \n\"What happened in Hamburg is past, for sure. But I have nothing to say (to Nadal). I have all respect with him outside and inside the court,\" said the Italian. \n\"I was telling another time, the history (argument) was not against him, but against his team, especially the uncle. But is something that is really far away. \n\"If I have to do something, I do it in the moment. If I do it wrong, I say, 'Sorry'. If I'm right, I'm right, and that's it.\" — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:25:19.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
