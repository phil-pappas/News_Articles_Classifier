He guided The News’ No. 2 Large School to scores on three of their first five possessions and 310 yards in offense before halftime against the fourth-ranked large school.\nWith the win, the Quakers positioned themselves to clinch the division title and a top seed for the playoffs should they beat visiting Jamestown next Friday.\nPlayer of the game: Janca. The OP quarterback completed 11 of his first 13 passes for 156 yards. The fact that the Quakers had success running made Janca even more dangerous throwing. Through three quarters, he had 243 yards on 15-of-21 passing. He finished 20 for 31 for 306 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He rushed for touchdowns of 26 and 2 yards. He could have completed more passes but there were a few drops by OP receivers. He also rushed seven times for 48 yards.\nDrive of the game: After Lancaster took a 7-0 lead on its first possession, OP needed six plays to travel 60 yards for the tying TD. Josh Dahl scored on a 3-yard run, capping a drive in which he rushed five times for 45 yards.\nJanca had an impact on this drive too as he audibled to run plays when he saw the defense geared toward stopping the pass.\n“Dillon called some audibles,” OP coach Gene Tundo said. “He has the ability to do that. He’s a great quarterback.”\nTurning point: With OP clinging to a 14-10 lead, the Legends seemed as if they were going to turn a takeaway into points late in the second quarter. Instead, Lancaster turned it over on second down from the 9 via a bad snap. The Quakers’ Ethan Dempsey pounced on the loose ball with 2:48 left to end the threat. Ten plays later, with 17 seconds left in the quarter, OP’s Janca scored on a 2-yard run to make it 21-10. On that drive, Janca passed for 70 yards and rushed for 8.\n“That was a momentum-turner,” Lancaster coach Chris Dickson said.\nDefense, defense: Visions of a potential no-punt game danced through fans’ heads after both teams marched down the field with ease for two touchdowns before the game was even five minutes old. OP made a little tweak that made all the difference in the world in slowing down Lancaster enough so that the Quakers’ offense could build a lead. Yes, the Legends compiled yardage, but didn’t come anywhere close to the 49.75 points per game they have averaged against Western New York opponents.\n“We decided we were sending the tackles to the A gap instead of the B gap and that just destroyed their zone play,” OP middle linebacker Ronnie Shul said.\n“Our defensive line put some pressure on their quarterback,” Tundo said. “I’m very satisfied with how we played.”\nStats: Dahl rushed 13 times for 141 yards and three touchdowns, including a 53-yarder 10 seconds after Lancaster scored to pull within 35-18 with just over six minutes left. He added eight tackles on defense. OP teammate Matt Paolini rushed 15 times for 61 yards. Also on defense, Corey McPoland led the Quakers with 10 tackles, while Collin Creagan had nine.\nWe’re talking about balance: Orchard Park passed for 306 yards and rushed for 300 yards as the Quakers did their best New England Patriots impression on offense by keeping Lancaster’s defense off balance. Janca even got in on the rushing act, taking it to the house on a 26-yard scramble that broke a 7-7 tie, giving OP the lead for good with just under four minutes left in the first quarter.\nTundo on the win: “It puts us in first place. We have to take care of business next week.”\nRecords: Orchard Park 5-1, 3-0. Lancaster 4-2, 3-1.\nNext: Orchard Park returns to action at home against rival Jamestown at 7 p.m. Friday. Lancaster takes a short road trip for a 7:30 p.m. Friday clash at bitter rival Depew.\nemail: mrodriguez@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:37:08.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
