Coaches know better, however. Providence College hoop coach Ed Cooley begins his fifth season at the school when workouts begin this Saturday. He has four freshmen and six players who’ve never scored a collegiate point on his roster and while the majority of them need to have major success for the Friars to win a lot of games, Cooley knows how far they need to come before PC tips off its season Nov. 14 against Harvard. “They may think they’re ready,” Cooley said, “but the bright lights aren’t on in practice. They have to earn their time under those bright lights in practice.” PC has four true freshmen in guards Drew Edwards (Perry Hall, Md.) and Ricky Council (Durham, N.C.), wing forward Ryan Fazekas (Chesterton, Ind.) and big forward Quadree Smith (Temple Hills, Md.). Redshirt sophomore Rodney Bullock is finally healthy after recovering from an ACL tear last October and sophomore guard Tyree Chambers is ready after coping with a leg injury a year ago. Add it all up and Cooley could have a starter (or two), plus the bulk of his bench, from the above list. “All of them have to help,” said Cooley. “They’re all still growing and learning. Roles are still being identified here over the next four weeks.” While classes have been running for only a month, the freshmen already know the fastest routes back to their dorm rooms and where to find the best pizza slices on campus. The newcomers spent at least five weeks on campus over the summer taking classes and being introduced to Cooley’s coaching style. They say that indoctrination has really helped speed up their growth as players. “I think we’re ready,” Edwards said of the newcomers. “We’ve been here all summer, we’ve been working really hard and really pushing it. I think we’re going into practice really strong.” Edwards is an interesting prospect. He’s a thin 6-3 combo guard who’s added eight pounds of muscle over the summer working into strength coach Kenny White’s program. He appears a long ways away from being ready to play Big East defense but after starring in one of the nation’s most competitive high school leagues (Baltimore Catholic League) for Calvert Hall College High School, Edwards clearly knows how to compete. “They said they were worried about my strength and I know I’m stronger now,” Edwards said, “but I think the game really well. I know I’ll be able to make up for what I lack physically by being strong mentally.” Page 2 of 2 - Edwards scored over 1,500 points in his varsity career and it’s that ability to put points on the board that unites three of PC’s four frosh. Council, a 6-5 wing, shot over 45 percent from beyond the 3-point arc last season and hit for 10 threes and 53 points in a single game. Fazekas, a finalist for Indiana’s Mr. Basketball award, is a bit taller at 6-7 and also owns a deadly stroke. “Coach Cooley has confidence in us and brought us in here to play,” said Council. “Coming into practice I feel very confident. I know if I’m consistent from the three-point line I can see a lot of time,” Council said. Cooley says it’s no surprise that he’s added players who can, at least potentially, knock down jumpers. After watching his team convert just 31 percent of its 3-pointers a year ago, he ordered his coaching staff to find him some shooters. PC’s leading returning 3-point shooter is point guard Kris Dunn (35%). “That’s what we brought them in here to do,” Cooley said. “They have to buy into their roles and their time and their roles can get bigger as they expand their games. I want their games to develop off what they do best, and for those guys it’s shooting the basketball.” The Friars also have two newcomers to their thin frontcourt. Smith will play if only because at 6-8 and 280 pounds his size will be an asset. Then there’s Bullock, the 6-8 forward who has been at PC for two years and never played in a game due to a season-long suspension and a knee injury. If he can shake two years of rust off his game, he’s a potential starter. “Right now it’s still so early. They all have a lot of learn,” Cooley said. “Everything from terminology, where they’re supposed to be on offense and defense, rhythm, timing. They don’t know what they don’t know yet.” FRIAR DRIBBLES: PC is launching a \"microsite\" Thursday devoted to All-America candidate Dunn’s upcoming season. The site – Friars.com/GetItDunn – will contain information and videos focusing on Dunn…Cooley and his staff are now looking for much-needed size to compliment point guard recruit Maliek White in their Class of 2016. Cooley spent Tuesday afternoon at Worcester Academy watching recruiting target Kevin Marfo. The 6-7 power forward is also looking at Boston College and George Washington. The Friars’ top big target is Sedee Keita, a 6-10 center at Putnam (Conn.) Science Academy who is expected to visit PC in two weeks. The Friars are also a finalist for Jalen Johnson, an athletic 6-7 wing from North Carolina. providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:53:45.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
