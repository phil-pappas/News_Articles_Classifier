Dan Rogers, WFAA Sports 10:41 a.m. CDT October 6, 2015 The running game was supposed to be a strength for the Cowboys but it's been largely ineffectual thus far New Orleans Saints cornerback Brandon Browner (39) and defensive end Bobby Richardson (78) tackle Dallas Cowboys running back Christine Michael (30) (Photo: Derick E.

And the players lost aren't just your average Joe's. The Cowboys are missing the team's franchise quarterback, All-Pro wide receiver, best defensive end, and best cornerback. Plus, they even lost their best linebacker on Sunday when he missed most of the game after suffering a first quarter concussion. That's five players that are the best of their respective position groups. And since Lance Dunbar was having a career season, it only seems fitting that he got hit with a season ending injury. And that doesn't even include Randy Gregory, who was wreaking havoc in the preseason before he got hurt in week one. \nWe get it. The team is decimated with injuries. But that's out of their control so why waste another minute talking about it? Let's focus on the players that are playing. While there becomes a general understanding that the performance of these replacement guys will produce inferior results, it is still surprising to witness the poor play that has plagued this team over the last six quarters. So what is going on? \nWell, pick your poison. The defense hasn't been playing well. The team keeps having mental lapses, like forgetting how many players they are supposed to have out there. But the biggest and most glaring concern is the lack of production in the running game. The running game was supposed to be be this team's salvation. Not only does it help move the chains, but it helps keep the defense off the field. And it just hasn't been there. \nLast season, the Cowboys had a dominant ground attack averaging 143 yards per game, ranking them 2nd in the league. This season, the Cowboys have only gained 108 yards per game, ranking them 16th. The reliance on a strong running game is even more crucial now as the team needs to keep the game manageable for their backup QB and help keep their ailing defense off the field. The Cowboys haven't been able to consistently grind out the dirty yards. In both of the last two games, the Cowboys had flashed a couple great runs out of the gate but then proceeded to hit a wall the rest of the game. Why is this happening? Everyone has their own opinion about this, so I'll take a look at few theories. \nTheory #1 – The Cowboys miss DeMarco Murray \nIf you had no idea what was going on in Philadelphia, then maybe this might seem reasonable. But considering he's only rushed for 47 yards so far this season, that's not really playing very favorable towards supporting this theory. Make no mistake about it, Murray is a lot better than what his 2015 stats suggest, but it should be evident that he needs a good offensive line to be the player he was in Dallas. \nThe Cowboys trio of running backs – Joseph Randle, Darren McFadden, and Lance Dunbar have all demonstrated they can do great things when they have running lanes. But the Cowboys just haven't had them. Which brings me to… \nTheory #2 – The offensive line is struggling \nThis one is tricky. On the surface, it sure looks like they are losing the battle more times than not. The quality of play has certainly been a little shaky at times. One attributing factor could be the lack of cohesiveness as they have had to shuffle in Mackenzy Bernadeau and rookie, La'el Collins already this season as Ron Leary has missed time with an injury. But Leary was on the field on Sunday night, and yet the weak defensive front of the Saints was able to get penetration. \nWhatever the cause might be, the Cowboys haven't been able to effectively block in the running game. \nIn the passing game, however, it's a different story. The offensive line is doing exactly what we saw them do last season. Brandon Weeden is not being rushed and most of the pressure he does feel is from instances where he's trotting around too long in the backfield. The Cowboys have already had two instances this season where the offense has had to abandon the run and lead a long drive for a game tying score. And in those moments, the offensive line was outstanding. \nWhile this unit is certainly capable of playing better, there is no real deficiency here. This isn't the cause. \nTheory #3 – The Cowboys aren't winning the outside \nSo if the offensive line isn't playing bad, then why are teams getting penetration and shutting down the running game? \nThe real difference isn't what the Cowboys offensive line is doing, but rather what their opponents are doing. The opposing defenses has shown that they are committed to stopping the run by allocating a lot of players to the line of scrimmage. What Dallas has been failing to do is make plays on the outside to force them to stay back. If the offense can starting having success outside the hash marks, this will help loosen up the running game. With no Tony Romo and no Dez Bryant, defenses can target the ground game more effectively. Dallas has to find a way to make them pay for doing that. \nWatching the offense use the passing game so well in those game tying drives has to make you wonder if this team could be more successful if they changed their approach. I know it's great to establish the run, and ultimately you want to get to that point. But right now – the Cowboys don't have players that can really stretch the field so they need to find something else that works. Fans want to see what they saw last year, but this isn't your 2014 offense. This is an offense with a lot of new players counted on to move the chains. Cowboys' offensive coordinator, Scott Linehan needs to figure out how to utilize the players he has to get this done. \nTeams are going to challenge Brandon Weeden to beat them and like it or not – Dallas is going to have to find a way for him to do just that. Continuing to force the run into a loaded front is not going to cut it. Once this team demonstrates the ability to beat you in the passing game, it will force defense to play more honest and make the battle in the trenches a fair fight. And in a fair fight, the Cowboys offensive line will come out on top. \nFor more on the Cowboys, be sure to follow Dan Rogers on Twitter @DannyPhantom24 . 67 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wfaa.com/1LfXpui TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:28:58.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
