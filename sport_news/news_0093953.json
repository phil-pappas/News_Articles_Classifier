The election is coming next year, May, and before that I will probably have one fight. \n\"We are going to finalise by November or December.\" \nPacquiao, whose record stands at 57 wins, two draws and six losses, blamed a shoulder injury for his poor showing against Mayweather and is desperate to make amends before finally hanging up his gloves. \nMayweather retired last month following another easy victory against Andre Berto to extend his record to a perfect 49-0. \nHowever, having previously come out of retirement and with the chance to crack the half-century, few would be surprised if he returned for one last fight against his old rival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:59:36.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
