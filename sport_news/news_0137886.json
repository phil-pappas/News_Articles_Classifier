We feel honoured by their visit,” he was quoted as saying in the daily El Diario . \nMidfielder Rudy Cardozo said he felt inspired by the visit. \n“It was a nice experience, the soldiers gave us that message of fighting for one’s country, it’s an extra motivation,” he said. \nBolivia have not reached the World Cup finals since 1994 in the United States with Baldivieso in their midfield. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:11:22.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
