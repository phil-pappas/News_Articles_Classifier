I've never thought that made a bit of difference in this American League West race. I started changing my mind Tuesday night.\nIt wasn't just the fact that the Rangers slipped into first place with Mitch Moreland's 9th-inning sacrifice fly, setting off a celebration that looked more like the clinching of the pennant than a Tuesday night victory. The Astros are starting to look like exactly what they are -- a young, untested team that knows how to swing for the fences and not much more.\nIn an age where everyone strikes out, the Astros have taken this to new heights. They lead the majors and have 150 more strikeouts than the league average. And in losing the first two games here to fall one half game behind Texas, they seem to be squeezing those bats tighter than ever.\nIn addition, Houston opened the doors for the Rangers' victory in the ninth inning by playing Adrian Beltre almost warning-track deep, giving center fielder Colby Rasmus no chance to catch what might have been a routine fly had he played at normal depth. Act like you've been there?\nThe Astros, almost to a man, haven't been there while Beltre, Moreland, Elvis Andrus, Mike Napoli, Cole Hamels and Derek Holland have big World Series moments on their resumes.\nTexas hasn't accomplished anything yet. The Rangers send out the man who would currently have to be their No. 5 starter, Martin Perez, to face Cy Young candidate Dallas Keuchel tonight. And after Thursday's series closer, there are three big games to come in Houston at the end of next week.\nIn some ways, with the Rangers sliding in front of the Astros for the first time all season with 18 games to go, this thing is just getting started.\nThere are more raucous celebrations to come. The Rangers just want to be participants in the final one.\nOn Twitter:\n @TimCowlishaw", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TimCowlishaw"], "published": "2015-09-16T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:20:38.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
