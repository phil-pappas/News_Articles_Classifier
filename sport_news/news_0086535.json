Volleyball practice Wednesday at Vista Grande took on a different look. It wasn’t as much about the physical as the mental. Specifically, it was about playing games out regardless of how far behind the team fell. Little did coach Kiki Wilson know that 24 hours later the Spartans would be confronted with that situation. Wilson couldn’t have been happier with the ultimate outcome as host Vista Grande overcame a 13-point deficit in the third game to sweep Catalina 25-21, 21-18, 28-26 in a Division III/Section 3 match. “We talked about doing everything you can to finish the game,” Wilson said. “It showed me that the talk was worth it. The girls showed a lot of heart and dedication to come back. They don’t quit.” It would have been easy to quit the way the Spartans (3-8, 2-1 section) started the third game. With Cat Lopez serving four aces during an eight-point run, the Trojans (2-11, 1-4) bolted to a 16-4 lead. And it got worse as Catalina boosted the lead to 19-6. “We got way too comfortable in the third game,” Wilson said of VG’s lackluster start. “We played down to their level. We have a tendency to do that. But we were able to overcome it.” After a Catalina service error, Yara Vasquez served two aces as the Spartans closed to 19-12. After a hitting error, Vista Grande got four points in succession — three on aces by Ashley Morton — to close to 20-16. After another error, the Spartans scored four more points in a row (two on aces by Sarah Barker) to pull within 21-20. Vista Grande did not get its first lead until Barker had a kill to break a 26-26 tie. Ayliny Patino’s ace closed out the match. The third game followed the same pattern as the first game only the Spartans never trailed by more than five points. That came immediately as the Trojans raced to a 5-0 lead behind Kayla Bahe’s serving. Catalina maintained the advantage until a kill by Quiwania Robinson evened the score at 17-17 and an ace by Barker put Vista Grande in front for good. The game even ended the same as the third game — with an ace by Patino. Five different VG players had aces during the second game. After falling behind 2-0, the Spartans outscored the visitors 10-2 and maintained at least a four-point lead the rest of the game. Robinson and Veronica Calderon each had six kills to lead the VG hitting. Morton had five kills and 10 assists. Vista Grande had 22 aces. Barker had six aces among her 11 service points. Morton had four aces, and Patino and Jaysie Hall-Williams had three each. “I thought ‘Q’ (Robinson) gave us a spark,” Wilson said. “We talked with her about stepping up and she came out of nowhere. Our setters did well.” Mostly, however, Wilson was pleased with her “comeback kids.” “We definitely talked about that (Wednesday),” Wilson said. “What we went over (Wednesday) we were able to do. I was very happy with that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:24:06.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
