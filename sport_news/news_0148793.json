The Patriots were forced to punt, but got second life on a Central roughing the kicker penalty for an automatic first down. The very next play, Joe Young hit Jonah Gundrum for the 25-yard touchdown pass and 21-7 halftime lead. \nTop performer: Andres Santos. The senior played big on both sides of the ball. He rushed for two first-half touchdowns and went over 100 yards while recovering a pair of fumbles in the second half, taking one of them back for a 22-yard touchdown. \nWhat it means: This was an important win for Freedom, its first real test of the season, especially without running back Roberto Diez. The Patriots defense looked as advertised, making everything tough for Central. The Vikings wrapped up a brutal stretch of Parkland-Easton-Freedom going 1-2 and have Nazareth next week. \nSpecial teams rule: The Vikings got the party started when Darnell Ferrell returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, which was a taste of what was to come. The Patriots used a fake punt to gain a first down (on a Central pass interference call), blocked a punt and later drew a roughing the kicker penalty on a punt to gain another first down. \nFreedom D the real deal: The Patriots allowed just 97 yards on 26 plays in the first half and forced three fumbles overall to help keep all the momentum. The defense didn't allow a touchdown until there was 9:51 left in the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:53:16.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
