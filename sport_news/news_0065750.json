Ellis, an Alva native and former Ranger, had a big homecoming with touchdown runs of 81 and 44 yards. His playing time came after injuries to Jordan Barnes and Isaiah Mallory. “It’s great to be back,” Ellis said. “Our O-line did a great job opening things up. I had a lot of people come out. I’ve been looking forward to this game.” Reid Miller threw three touchdown passes in the second quarter, hitting Riley Hess for touchdowns of 19 and 10 yards and Arte Mura for 32 yards for a 21-0 lead. Will Hawkins gave the Rangers a 24-0 lead with a 37-yard field goal with 2:05 remaining in the half. Northwestern got the ball one more time and decided to go for more points and Devontrae Young made them pay, intercepting Reid and returning it 37 yards for a touchdown. Trey Tully added the PAT to make it 24-7 with 55 seconds left in the half. Ellis broke through the line and raced 81 yards for the first offensive touchdown by the Bison with 12:03 remaining in the third quarter. “That was a big momentum changer for us,” said head coach Chris Jensen. “To see Jacob going yard in his hometown made a big change on our sideline.” Jailen Garrett picked off Reid to set the Bison up again, with Ellis moving the ball to the one on an 18-yard carry before Dez Stegall punched it in on a sneak to make it 24-21 with5:36 remaining in the third quarter. The Bison took their first lead when Ellis scored from 44 yards to finish off a nine-play, 95-yard drive. Miller ran in from two yards out after OBU had fumbled there, giving Northwestern a 31-27 lead. Stegall scored again on a one-yard plunge to make it 34-31 after a five-play, 54-yard drive, highlighted by a 31-yard Cooper Koons to Stephan Turner pass. Brynden Pitzer put the final Bison score on the board, taking an interception 26 yards for the touchdown and a 41-31 lead with 8:18 to go. “I just enjoy football and making a play like that makes me happy – and happier for the team to be honest,” Pitzer said. “I think we had him back on his heels from so many hits in the game.” OBU had seven sacks with Pitzer and Kimes Gilbert getting credit for 1.5 each, while Jason Lee, Levi Jennings, Gage Wimer and Zack Bishop all registered one. Northwestern scored one more time but D’Ante Meeking came up with a big interception to put the game in solid hands. Page 2 of 2 - “We’re thankful for this win. A lot of prayers had to be answered today,” said Jensen. “We made just enough offensive plays to win. We have a lot to work on. We knew we had to get pressure on their quarterback and we felt like we had the speed at defensive end to make things happen.” Ellis’ 211 yards led a 265-yard rushing attack. Dez Stegall (44 yards), Blake Woodard (29) and Koons (32) combined for 125 yards passing. Turner had five catches for 47 yards. Pitzer and Gilbert had nine tackles each with the Bison getting interceptions from Pitzer, Young, Meeking, Garrett and Lane Taylor. Taylor’s pick stopped a drive at the one. Now 2-5 on the season, the Bison host Southwestern Oklahoma State at noon Saturday.
