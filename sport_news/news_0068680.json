Instead the Raiders will take a 1-4 record into Friday night's Mid-State 38 Delaware Division game. The Raiders, the defending division champs, fell 28-21 to Phillipsburg (4-1) Friday night at Noonan Field. For the third time this season, they had a chance to either tie or win a game very late. \nHillsborough had a first and 10 at the Liners' 13 with just under six minutes left in regulation, but a fumble on the first play was recovered by P'Burg to end the threat. \nP'Burg never allowed the Raiders to get the ball back as senior quarterback Zachary Ringhoff and star senior back Manny Romero converted fourth downs with short runs to sustain the drive. \nEvery losing team has a moment or two to point to as a \"if only\" moment, and for the Raiders it was the fumble and also sophomore Jackson Parham's second-half opening 95-yard kickoff return for a score called back because of a hold. \n\"I'm kinda getting tired of saying 'well, you guys were close,' '' coach Kevin Carty said. \nThe Raiders did play much better than in their 28-0 loss to Bridgewater-Raritan. Parham caught eight passes for 160 yards and two touchdowns and quarterback Joe Schultz threw for 157 yards and two scores in the first half. P'Burg was held to 79 net yards on 40 carries, but Riinghoff threw for 222 yards and three touchdowns. ​Romero had six catches for 104 yards and two touchdowns. \n\"We really sold out to stop the run,\" Carty said. \nThe Raiders were limited to 33 rushing yards on 22 carries, but the team should get a boost this week with the return of senior linemen Rob Toth and Tyler Sanfillippo, who've been out with injuries. \nCarty believes the Raiders can make the Central Group V playoffs — they were 11th last week — but a win or two in the next three weeks against Union, Elizabeth (home) and Montgomery (away) will be needed. \nVOORHEES REVIEW: Nobody seems to be able to stop Cranford quarterback Jack Schetelich — Voorhees included. Schetelich had one of those special Friday nights at the expense of the Vikings in a MS 38 Raritan Division game that ended in a 49-24 win at Diegnan Field. He ran for a touchdown in the third period to give the Cougars the lead at 28-24. He also threw two touchdowns and picked off three. \nVoorhees gave a great effort, taking a 24-21 third period lead, but Cranford scored 32 unanswered points with Schetelich's seven-yard TD giving the defending division champs the lead for good at 28-24. That was set up by a 53-yard pass to Sean Leonard. Voorhees' own standout senior quarterback Charlie Roddenberger threw for a touchdown and ran for two others — the first a 72-yarder in the first period. \nThe Vikings play at Rahway Saturday afternoon. \nDELAWARE VALLEY REVIEW: Another game, another Union County Mid-State 38 Hills Division beaten in Alexandria Township. Del Val is now 5-0 after clubbing Rahway 42-7. The Terriers rushed for 280 yards with junior Nick Perno (93 yards), senior Corey Shedlock (88 yards and two touchdowns) and senior Ryan Romaine (83 yards, two touchdowns) leading the way. \nNORTH PLAINFIELD REVIEW: If the Canucks are going to get that first win any time soon, they will have to stop making killer turnovers. After senior Ceisean Tucker's three-yard run cut Warren Hills' lead to 21-6 late in the third period in Washington. North Plainfield followed by forcing the Streaks to punt, but the ball was fumbled, recovered by WH at the NP 14. \nThe Streaks scored on the next play as Cooper Gabrich threw a touchdown pass to Carsen Johnson for a 27-6 lead. The Canucks showed resilience as they drove downfield, setting up with a first-and-goal from the Streaks' nine. But the Canucks fumbled the ball into the end zone, the Streaks recovering for a touchback. \n\"Tonight was where our season has been. At times, we have played very well, and done things very, very well, and at times, we have looked the complete opposite,'' NP coach Bobby Lake said. \"We are finding new ways each week to lose games. It's the things we talk about all the time, preparation — your success and execution comes Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday preparation for games — and we're just not preparing well enough right now. It's unfortunate we play really, really hard, our kids play really hard. We just don't play really smart at times and put ourselves in bad situations.'' \nTucker had 104 yards on 20 carries. Now the Canucks get to return to west Jersey as they play in Alexandria against unbeaten Del Val Friday night in a MS 38 Raritan Division game. The Canucks stunned the Terriers 22-21 at Krausche Field last season.
