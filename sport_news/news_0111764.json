We’re not able to forget about that game.” \nSo when the two ancient rivals meet for the 94th time Saturday (1:30 p.m.) in a Colonial League game on the hill at Pen Argyl, there will be a lot more at stake than the teams’ records – Wilson at 1-6, the Green Knights at 0-7 – would indicate. \nFor one thing, it’s Homecoming at Pen Argyl, which will insure an animated and large crowd on hand at Alumni Stadium. \n“I think it will help; we’re a small school, a tight group of kids,” Green Knights coach Paul Reduzzi said. “We’re focused on a small positive end to the season. I told the kids we have Homecoming, then Senior Day (Palisades Oct. 31) and then Bangor game. We’ll be ready. I am proud of these kids and the way they have handled themselves.” \nWilson coach Matt Senneca hopes the joint will be rocking. \n“We’re excited to go up there and play at that place,” he said. “We hear about it all the time, but none of our kids have really played up there. It’s a great atmosphere and we are looking forward to playing in it.” \nLast year’s thriller saw Wilson seeking its first win while Pen Argyl entered with one victory to its credit. This year, that is reversed, as the Warriors own a 21-20 defeat of Catasauqua while the Green Knights, having played without doubt the toughest schedule in the Colonial League, are winless and have been outscored 109-6 in the last two weeks in losses to Saucon Valley and Notre Dame. \nThere’s a difference in opinion, though, as to whether Wilson’s experience with winning helps the Warriors or not. \n“I think that will definitely help us,” Huber said. “We picked up some lessons from that game, we know the things that made us successful, things we did well, and we’re going to use them against Pen Argyl and go up there and get that game.” \nSenneca’s not so sure. \n“I think it might be a disadvantage for us,” he said. “Their kids are hungry to go out and get their first win and our kids have already gotten that.” \nReduzzi said the Green Knihts haven’t been broken with the adversity of seven straight defeats. \n“They have handled things well, kept their composure and they’ve come out and worked hard,” he said. “There’s a frustration level in all of us, coaches and players. We see a lot of good things, even last week (42-6 loss to Notre Dame) our second team did some strong things and we showed a lot of character. We have a great competitive attitude, but we have not developed the consistency needed to win games.” \nSenneca knows the feeling. \n“The biggest thing for us is that we have to play all 48 minutes,” he said. “We did that in the Catasauqua game and you saw the result. But in other games we play a tough first half and are flat in the second half. We can’t win a game with 24 minutes of football and our kids are starting to buy into that.” \nJust how the game will be won Saturday, though, there seems to be little disagreement. \n“They depend on their running and we have to stuff that,” Huber said. “And on offense, we have to run the ball right down their throat.” \nWhile Senneca said that he was pleased with his team’s improvement in the passing game over the last few weeks, neither coach disagreed with Huber’s succinct analysis. \n“We try to use packages where we can get all three of our running backs – (sophomore) Logan Sterner , and (juniors) Logan Ruppert and Austin Heisler going, though Austin has some foot issues and may not be able to go Saturday,” said Reduzzi of his three backs who have combined for 748 yards and five touchdowns this season. “They’ve done a lot of good things and we’ll use them at running back and at wide receiver. We want all three of them touching the ball.” \nWilson will try and get sophomore tailback Job Goodman (658 yards, 5.1 yards per carry, 4 TDs) going quickly. \n“If we can get some points on the board early and control the line of scrimmage, we’ll be OK, but we have had trouble doing that in a lot of games,” Senneca said. “And we better do it Saturday because if Paul gets his running game going I don’t see Pen Argyl putting the ball in the air very much.” \nReduzzi said he likes what he has seen from his senior quarterback Jake Holden lately, though, as well as another senior who, like Holden, did not play as a junior. \n“Defensive lineman Jake Sutton had his best game of the year last week and he’s really feeling strong,” Reduzzi said. Sutton will lead a line that will have a size advantage on the Warriors. \nIn the end, though, this game may well come down to character, heart, and guts moe than Xs-and-Os. Both teams, after a couple of weeks of games against the Colonial League elite, are playing a team “that looks us like us,” as Reduzzi said. And in such a game, desire may rule. \n“We’re practicing like practice is a game,” Huber said. “We know you play like you practice. We think this game will come down to how much we want it, and we’re planning on stepping up and wanting it Saturday.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:08:03.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
