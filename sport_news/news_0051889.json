Raza also ended unbeaten at the crease on 60, the score Ervine had earlier posted before being ousted. \nIreland's innings started in unconvincing fashion as they slipped to 54 for three, but a fourth-wicket partnership of 83 between Wilson and Joyce saw them gain some momentum. \nThings fizzled out somewhat thereafter, though, with John Nyumbu (two for 35) and Masakadza (two for 45) impressing to leave Zimbabwe with a thoroughly achievable-looking target. \nThe hosts subsequently made tough work of getting there as George Dockrell (two for 29) and Andy McBrine (two for 53) restricted their progress. \nBut they made it in the end, thanks chiefly to the efforts of Ervine and Raza as Ireland were left to reflect on three dropped catches. \nPrevious meetings between the two sides have tended to be closely-fought affairs and Ireland will be hoping to draw this three-match series level when they play each other again on Sunday.
