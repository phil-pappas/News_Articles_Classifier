Young Kwak AP Photo 1 of 5 Order Reprint of this Story PULLMAN, Wash. \nThe first half of Saturday's game at Washington State was a nightmare for Oregon State and new coach Gary Andersen. \nThe Beavers trailed 45-17 after two quarters, and looked dead in the water. \nThings perked up considerably in the second half, when Oregon State shut down the Cougars. But it was too little too late as Washington State posted a 52-31 victory. \n\"Everything was better in the second half; defensively, offensively, special teams,\" Andersen said. \"The second half we were able to make some aggressive calls and make things happen.\" \nThe struggling Beavers continued to have defensive woes, giving up more than 40 points for the third consecutive game. The pass attack also suffered, as freshman quarterback Seth Collins completed 17 of 30 passes for 176 yards, but was intercepted twice. \n\"Seth would like to have a few balls back,\" Andersen said. \"We need to throw the ball better.\" \nWashington State quarterback Luke Falk tied a team record with six touchdown passes, but all came in the first half. The offense did not score in the second half. \n\"We let our foot off the gas in the second half,\" said Falk, who completed 39 of 50 passes for 407 yards, and was intercepted twice. \"We need to make corrections and have a complete game.\" \nWashington State (4-2, 2-1 Pac-12), coming off an upset victory at Oregon, hadn't beaten a Pac-12 opponent in Martin Stadium since November 2013. \nThey have already eclipsed the three wins they had all of last season, and this was the 100th win of coach Mike Leach's career. Leach was doused with water by his team after the game. \n\"They dump water all over you and you have to change your shirt,\" Leach said, when asked how he felt about reaching 100 wins. \nThe Cougars scored on all seven of their first-half possessions and piled up 520 yards of offense. \nQuarterback Seth Collins ran for 124 yards for Oregon State (2-4, 0-3), which rushed for 218 yards in the game. \n\"It was a tale of two halves,\" Andersen said. \"We couldn't stop them in the first half.\" \nAndersen's sons grew up playing football with Falk in Logan, Utah, and Andersen was impressed by the WSU quarterback's play. \n\"He was on fire,\" Andersen said. \"We helped him at times, but he was on fire.\" \nFalk, who threw for 505 yards and five touchdowns at Oregon, came into the game leading the Pac-12 in passing at 396 yards per game, and has thrown 21 touchdown passes with just four picks this season. \nDom Williams caught 11 passes for 158 yards and two touchdowns for WSU. \nOregon State, produced 394 yards of total offense, but couldn't slow the Cougars in the first half. \nWashington State's Tavares Martin Jr. returned the opening kickoff 51 yards and the Cougars marched down the field, with Falk throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass to River Cracraft. \nOregon State went three-and-out, and Washington State replied with a 69-yard drive that ended with Falk's 3-yard touchdown pass to Williams. \nGarrett Owens kicked a 50-yard field goal to put Oregon State on the scoreboard near the end of the first quarter. \nGabe Marks caught a 23-yard touchdown pass from Falk in the opening seconds of the second quarter for a 21-3 lead. \nOregon State tried a fake punt from its own 20, but punter Nick Porebski was dropped for a 6-yard loss. After a touchdown pass to Marks was called back for offensive interference, the Cougars had to settle for a 30-yard field goal by Erik Powell and a 24-3 lead. \nOregon State's Victor Bolden returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards down the right sideline to cut the WSU lead to 24-10. \nThe Beavers then tried an onside kick, but the Cougars recovered on the 50. After a 28-yard reception by Williams, Falk's fourth touchdown pass was for eight yards to Jamal Morrow. \nAfter an OSU punt, Washington State drove 69 yards, with Falk throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Morrow for a 38-10 lead. \nOregon State's Collins led an 80-yard drive that ended with his 12-yard touchdown run. \nBut WSU replied with Falk's 11-yard touchdown pass to Williams in the closing seconds of the half, for a 45-17 halftime lead. \nFalk's six touchdown passes in the first half tied the school record for most touchdown passes in a full game, set by Connor Halliday last year. The Cougars had 399 yards of offense in the first half. \nNeither team scored in the third quarter. \nCollins threw a short touchdown pass to Jordan Villamin late in the fourth, to close within 45-25. The Beavers then recovered the on-side kick with 5:44 left in the game. But Collins was intercepted by Shalom Luani, who returned the ball 84 yards for a touchdown. Luani had a second interception to end Oregon State's next possession. \nThe Beavers came in with the Pac-12's top-ranked pass defense, allowing an average of 177 yards a game. \nLeach has a career record of 100-70 at Texas Tech and with the Cougars. \nThis is the 100th game in the series, which Washington State leads 50-47-3.
