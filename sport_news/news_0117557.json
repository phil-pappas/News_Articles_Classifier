Comment   By Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 7:44 PM By Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 7:44 PM ST. JAMES, Mo. It was another loss. But for more importantly for the St. James High School football team heading into district play, it was another game of adjustment after being forced to switch personnel due to numerous injuries. The Tigers closed out their regular season on Friday, dropping their Senior Night game to Pacific 28-20 in Four Rivers Conference action. It was the fifth consecutive loss for St. James which falls to 2-7 overall and ends FRC play at 1-5. The Pacific Indians improve to 3-6 and 3-3. St. James is seeded sixth for the Missouri Class 3 District 3 Tournament and will play at third-seeded Salem (4-5) at 7 p.m. on Friday in first-round district play. As far as last week’s game, a two-touchdown fourth quarter made the difference for Pacific. “We played very competitive football,” said St. James head coach Greg Harlan. “We were able to get on the scoreboard first and put pressure on them. It was a back-and-forth game.” During the current five-game losing streak the Tigers have had been hit with a slew of injuries. Harlan said he felt his squad displayed signs of adjusting against Pacific, just in time for district play. “We had some changes in personnel offensively and defensively due to injuries and (last) week we were able to get some kids back,” Harlan said. “Plus we were taking care of the football on offense more. Those were the two biggest differences.” St. James opened the scoring with a nine-yard touchdown run by sophomore running back Gunnar Seams. The PAT kick failed. Pacific came back with a three-yard TD run by senior running back Ashton Moore. Mitchell Broam added the PAT to give the Indians the lead. The Tigers regained the lead at the 2:34 mark of the second period, as junior running back Dawson Lynch scored on a five-yard run. Lynch ran in the two-point conversion. Pacific would tie the game later in the second quarter, as sophomore wideout/running back Matt Strong caught a 26-yard TD pass form senior quarterback Macke Meadows. Broam’s PAT made it 14-14 at intermission. Again St. James would grab the advantage, as sophomore quarterback Ryan Harlan capped a drive with a two-run TD run at the 5:27 mark of the third period. The conversion attempt failed. However, the fourth period belonged to Pacific, as the Indians scored two touchdowns to come from behind and get the win, scoring on a one-yard TD run by Moore and adding the PAT at the 6:55 mark to take a 21-20 lead and adding a five-yard run by Strong with 3:03 left. St. James had 301 yards of total offense compared to 290 for Pacific. Page 2 of 2 - Lynch rushed for 110 yards on 13 carries and caught three passes for 17 yards for the Tigers while Harlan hit on 7-of-18 passes for 80 yards and rushed for 60 yards on 19 attempts.
