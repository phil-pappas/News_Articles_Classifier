Two years ago he led the Grand Rapids Griffins in scoring. And despite playing in only 46 games last season, he won the goal-scoring title in the American Hockey League with 34 goals (he played 27 fewer games than the next-highest scorer). \nOn most NHL teams, Pulkkinen would be pencilled in for a top-six role. But as a fourth-round pick of the Detroit Red Wings, the 23-year-old, who has three goals and five points in three pre-season games, has been patiently counting down the days like a prisoner waiting for his eventual release. \n“If you’re coming here and you’re thinking you’re going to play in the show right away, it’s going to be hard,” said Pulkkinen, who was called up for 31 games last season. “I knew right away when I was drafted. Guys have to play in Grand Rapids first to take a step. I knew that.” \nAs training camps come to a close, the dominating story around the league is about all the players who could be jumping straight from the draft floor to the NHL. There is, of course, Edmonton’s Connor McDavid and Buffalo’s Jack Eichel. But from Carolina’s Noah Hanifin to New Jersey’s Lawson Crouse and even Pittsburgh second-round pick Daniel Sprong, top-end teenagers are getting ready to make their debuts everywhere you look. \nEverywhere, it seems, including Detroit. \nWhile the Red Wings have already returned 2015 first-round pick Evgeny Svechnikov to his junior team in Quebec, last year’s No. 15 pick Dylan Larkin (three goals and one assist in five games) is on the cusp of heading straight from college to the NHL. \nFor a team that had Tomas Tatar spend four years in the AHL, this is a bit unprecedented. The \"Detroit Way\" is to let prospects mature in the minors. Unless your name is Datsyuk or Zetterberg, the path to the NHL has been long and tiresome. In fact, you have to go back 25 years, when Keith Primeau was the No. 3 pick, to find the last draft pick who went straight to the NHL. \nBut with an aging roster and a new head coach, the way Detroit does things could be changing. \n“I don’t know about fresh blood,” said head coach Jeff Blashill. “You just want the best players that you have. The one thing about the NHL, the leading scorers in the league are younger than they were years ago. Young legs mean something. Skating is a big part of the NHL now. But in the end, we want the guys who are going to give us the best chance to win.” \nThe Red Wings, who finished with 100 points last season and made the playoffs for the 24th straight time, added defenceman Mike Green and centre Brad Richards in the offseason. So a letdown is not expected. And yet, it will be challenging for this team to sustain its production. \nThere are seven players on the roster who are 34 or older. Pavel Datsyuk will likely miss the start of the season after undergoing ankle surgery in the summer. The team is undergoing a transition. While Henrik Zetterberg and Datsyuk led Detroit in scoring, Tatar and Gustav Nyquist finished first and second in goals while 23-year-old goaltender Petr Mrazek emerged as the No. 1 goalie. \nWith a pipeline that is bursting with NHL-calibre prospects, more players are on the way. And the Red Wings have to decide whether to open up the floodgates or continue to preach patience. \n“I still think over 82 games we’re going to need 16 forwards,” said general manager Ken Holland. “The message that we’ve talked to our young people about is you build your resume and you wait for your opportunity. Fortunately we haven’t felt the pressure where we're struggling and had to dip in too early, thinking the saviour is down in the American League.” \nPrior to this year’s draft, The Hockey News ranked the Red Wings’ prospect pool ninth in the league. Anthony Mantha and Larkin were both ranked in the league’s top-10, with three others — Xavier Ouellet, Ryan Sproul and Pulkkinen — included among the top-50 prospects. No other team had more than four. \nPart of Detroit’s success is smart drafting. The franchise has not had a top-10 pick since Martin Lapointe in 1991, but has managed to unearth late-round gems like Jonathan Ericsson, who was the final pick in the final round in 2002. \nBut the bigger reason is development. Tatar spent four full seasons in the AHL — he was a top-2 scorer in three of those years — before getting a full-time role with the Red Wings. Nyquist spent two years. Ericsson spent three. \nPulkkinen, who spent two years in Grand Rapids, is the latest to go through the process. According to Holland, the 5-foot-10 winger has a “weapon” for a shot. But it was a weapon that took time to develop. \nYou can’t rush that. \n“The game’s younger and the game’s faster,” said Holland, “but at the end of the day if you’re not prepared mentally and physically and mature enough, it doesn’t matter how young or fast you are. The NHL is not a level where you build a resume of success, because the NHL is going to peck away at your confidence.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:10:21.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
