No. 13 ESU falls 27-24 at FHSU for Hornets' first loss By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nHAYS — Brent Wilson blamed himself. Garin Higgins blamed himself. \nRight or wrong, both took the brunt of No. 13 Emporia State’s 27-24 loss to Fort Hays State Saturday afternoon, which ended the Hornets’ perfect record for the season. \nWilson, ESU’s senior quarterback, was picked off three times for the first time in his career, though one came on a fourth down play and served as well as a punt. His final interception occurred with ESU on the Tigers’ 23, as Brock Long snagged the pass with one second on the clock to ice FHSU’s victory at home. \n“I just made a bad mistake throwing the ball there. He made a good play on the ball intercepting it, but I just got to be smart about it and make the right decisions,” said Wilson, who completed 27 of 41 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns. “Those three turnovers today, those are all one me. We can’t expect to win when we have those three turnovers. So I just got to go back through my reads, trust my routes that are happening and just trust the guys around me.” \n“Those three turnovers are all on me and I just got to be better,” he reiterated. \nAfter a timeout and with one still remaining, the plan was to take one shot at the end zone and kick the field goal if it didn’t work out. \nHindsight being 20/20, Higgins said simply kicking the 40-yard field goal with a solid breeze at ESU’s back might’ve been the right move, as a make would’ve sent the game to overtime. \n“Looking at it now, now that it’s over with, you can say ‘well, maybe we should’ve kicked it.’ That’s on me,” Higgins, ESU’s head coach, said. “I told them about that after the game. That’s on me. We just got greedy right there, and kicking the field goal with the wind gives us an opportunity to at least go into overtime. \n“We just didn’t execute there at the end and I didn’t make a good decision. Those two things played into (the loss).” \nPlenty of other factors played into ESU dropping its first game of the season. \nThe Hornets’ offense was limited to a season-low 376 yards of total offense. They went 2 of 7 on third down conversions in the first half and turned the ball over three times in the final two quarters. \n“They were really trying to force us to run the ball,” ESU junior receiver Mitchell Foote said. “We did a really good job of running the ball at first, and then all of a sudden they kind of slowed that down and our passing just slowed down with it. When you can’t get either one of them going, it’s hard to win ball games.” \nFoote was a bright spot in the Hornets’ otherwise off performance. The receiver pulled in 12 passes for a career-high 137 yards that included two touchdowns. \n“He comes ready to play. He brings a lot of energy to the field. What he does on the field is just outstanding,” Wilson said. “He makes some plays that not many people can do. I’m just proud of the guy and all the hard work he’s put in to this season. He’s just a great football player and I’m glad he’s on my team.” \nFoote also took a punt return 66 yards to the house, his second punt return score of the season, to put ESU up 24-20 with 2:42 to play. \n“Again, my teammates did a great job of blocking out there,” said Foote, who fielded the punt off a bounce. “We had scouted it all week, set up the right return and there was a hole so I just hit it.” \nFort Hays State spoiled Foote’s score by driving 75 yards in eight plays and finding the end zone on a 20-yard pass from Treveon Albert to Evan Jennings with 52 seconds left on the clock. \n“They have some weapons over there on offense, and we kept them bottled up really for the most part,” Higgins said. “It just got away right there at the end.” \nFort Hays totaled 375 yards on the ground, the most rushing yards allowed by ESU since a 2012 loss to Minnesota Duluth in the playoffs. The Tigers were paced by Shaquille Cooper’s 216 yards on 21 carries, boosted by an 89-yard score early in the fourth quarter to put his team up 20-17. Albert added 151 yards on the ground, highlighted by a 41-yard score in the third quarter to give the Tigers their first lead. \n“I thought we did a great job,” ESU senior linebacker Jason Tetuan said. “They had a few big plays and that’s what they live off of. I’m proud of the defense. We did a good job. I’m proud of the offense. I mean, we just needed to make a few more plays that we didn’t.” \nBoth offenses found the most success driving north with a significant south wind at their backs, neither scoring against it until the Tigers did twice in the fourth quarter. ESU outscored the Tigers 10-0 in the first quarter with the wind, while the Tigers booted two field goals in the second quarter to trail the Hornets 10-6 at halftime. \n“The wind definitely played a huge factor today. If you noticed, we didn’t take a lot of deep shots today,” Foote said. “That’s due to the fact that the wind was not on our side so we had to kind of get away from what we’re used to doing, (instead) throwing little dump passes. It kind of hurt us.” \nESU was held scoreless in the second and third quarters, both against the wind. It marked the Hornets’ first game with multiple scoreless quarters, of which they have only four on the season. \n“I just felt like offensively we didn’t click,” Higgins said. “We just could not get in a rhythm. We just didn’t play well, coach well and all of those things honestly. \n“Give (Fort Hays) credit. They’re a good football team. We just never could close the door, and when you go on the road and let them hang around, hang around, that’s what’s going to happen to you.” \nESU’s loss knocked it out of a two-way tie for first in the MIAA, but it holds sole possession of second with four games remaining. Next Saturday’s homecoming game against Missouri Western will be ESU’s first opportunity to rebound toward postseason goals still well within reach. \n“I see it as (the loss) as motivation. Just because it’s one game doesn’t mean it should define us,” Foote said. “We got four other games. We still have a great chance at making the playoffs. All we got to do is show up on Monday and be ready to go back to work.” \nESU (6-1) 10 0 0 14 – 24 \nFHSU (5-2) 0 6 7 14 – 27 \nESU — Morton 34 kick \nESU — Foote 10 pass from Wilson (Morton kick) \nFHSU — O’Brien 36 kick \nFHSU — O’Brien 39 kick \nFHSU — Albert 41 run (O’Brien kick) \nESU — Foote 16 pass from Wilson (Morton kick) \nFHSU — Cooper 89 run (O’Brien kick) \nESU — Foote 66 punt return (Morton kick) \nFHSU — Jennings 20 pass from Albert (O’Brien kick) \nGAME IN FIGURES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:56:26.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
