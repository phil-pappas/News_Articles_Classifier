It was the first time in franchise history that the Flames played a three-on-three overtime contest. In the offseason, the National Hockey League changed its rules and implemented a three-on-three overtime format rather than a four-on-four overtime format.\nJohnny Gaudreau was the overtime hero for the Flames. The native of Salem, New Jersey scored his first of the season. He also had two assists on the two previous Flames goals by Dougie Hamilton and Sean Monahan. Hamilton scored his first goal in a Flames uniform. He was the Flames biggest offseason acquisition, as the defenseman was acquired from the Boston Bruins at the time of the NHL Entry Draft.\nJiri Hudler also had a multi-point game for the Flames. The reigning Lady Byng Trophy winner from a year ago notched two assists.\nA major reason why the Flames were victorious on Saturday is because they were able to capitalize on a sloppy Canucks turnover. Brandon Sutter tried to carry the puck out of his own zone but was stopped by Dennis Wideman, who passed the puck to Gaudreau.\nThe Flames now improve to 1-1 on the season, while the Canucks drop to 1-0-1. Calgary next plays host to the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday, while the Canucks next game is in Anaheim on Monday.", "external_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/flames-canucks-ot-gaudreau-1.3266447"], "published": "2015-10-11T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:48:32.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
