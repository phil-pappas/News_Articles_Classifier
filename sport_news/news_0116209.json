The only other NCAA team with five consecutive 60-point games was Oklahoma in 2008. \nCorey Coleman had two more touchdown catches, his sixth consecutive game with multiple scores pushing his FBS-leading total to 18. He also surpassed Kendall Wright's school record for career touchdowns with his 31st. \nColeman had a 36-yard score on Baylor's opening drive, then had a downfield block that helped quarterback Seth Russell break free on a 37-yard TD run for a quick 14-0 lead. Coleman caught a 12-yarder from Jarrett Stidham in the closing minutes. \nIowa State fell to 2-5, 1-3. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:47:09.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
