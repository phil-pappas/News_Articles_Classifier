But throughout his career, Busch endured an annual tradition: Watching his Chase for the Sprint Cup hopes somehow blow up.\nAdChoices “It’s September, October, November right?” Busch said Friday at Dover International Speedway. “That’s typically the time of the season in which something seems to happen to myself.”\nIt’s true: The strangest twists of fate strike Busch during the Chase, which has resulted in him never coming close to winning the title despite 33 career Cup wins (only one of which came during the Chase).\nJust look at last week’s race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, when he had an inexplicable flat tire early in a run and crashed into the wall.\n“That just doesn’t make any sense,” Busch said of getting a flat tire after only 23 laps on it. “That has absolutely nothing to do with over-camber or over-using the brakes or melting a bead or anything like that. You can’t blow one that fast — but we can or I can.”\nThe resulting 37th-place finish left him 13th in the standings heading into an elimination race Sunday at Dover, after which only 12 drivers will advance.\nAnd it’s not like this is a new occurrence for Busch. Last year, the Joe Gibbs Racing driver was having his most consistent and solid start to the Chase yet, seemingly in prime position to advance to the third round.\nAll he had to do was stay out of trouble at Talladega Superspeedway, so the smart strategy play was to drop to the back.\nBut then a wreck happened in front of him and Austin Dillon didn’t hit the brakes in time, slamming into Busch from behind. Just like that, Busch’s Chase was done again.\n“In years past, I don’t know that it’s necessarily been a particular track or a particular moment that’s knocked us out of the Chase,” he said. “It doesn’t happen the same spot every single year. It happens all over the place.\n“It was Martinsville one year, it was Kansas one year, it was Charlotte another year, it was Talladega last year and right now it seems to be (New Hampshire) this year. It never ends.”\nSo with bad luck and misfortune looming around every turn, how does Busch approach the Chase races? It’s a matter of trying to get through those bad moments, he said, and move onto the next week with the least damage possible.\nOf course, a bad moment at Dover would likely mean there is no next week for his Chase hopes. That would be a major disappointment for Busch after he missed 11 races with a broken leg and foot, only to rally for a playoff berth and win four races in the regular season.\n“You’ve always got to fight through the Chase, and there’s been no give-up in this 18 all year long and there’s none right now,” he said. “We’re just going to power on through and do what we need to do this weekend to get to the next round.”\nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jeff_gluck", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:23:14.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
