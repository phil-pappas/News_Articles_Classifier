I have never seen so many people at a meet.” \nIf Maddison and Danley keep running they way they did Saturday, they may have to get used to attracting crowds. The Rovers (10-0) put on a dazzling display, led by senior Diana Hammerstone in first place at 20:02 and taking the top seven spots. \n“I have been doing this a long time and I don't remember an Easton team that is this talented and this deep,” Phillipsburg coach Joe Grady said. “It was impressive to watch. Obviously I wish we were on the other side of it, but I was still very much impressed.” \nSo was Easton coach Bobbi Jo Powell, especially with Maddison, who rise has been meteoric. \n“Lauren wasn’t even in our top group at all until about two weeks ago,” she said. “She is moving up every race.” \nMaddison and Danley hoped for success Saturday but were still surprised but what they accomplished. \n“I was just hoping to be in the top 10,” Danley said. \nMaddison agreed. \n“I didn’t think we’d be second and third like this,” she said. \nGrady, whose top finisher was senior Lexee Willey in eighth in 21:33, couldn’t say enough about the Rovers. \n“Easton is a remarkable team, and they should be commended for a tremendous effort today,” he said. \nPerhaps more cross country athletes should adopt the “Maddison Diet” if they want to run like the Easton freshman did Saturday. \n“Nornally I get bad cramps during a race,” she said. “But today I really ate well before the race. I had a banana, a graham bar, grapes, and water.” \nThe winning formula for Danley may have been the PAC course itself, a rolling test with a variety of terrain. \n“I love running on hills,” she said. “It’s fun to run on the hills.” \nEspecially when they are outrunning Stateliners. \n“It’s a friendly rivalry,” Maddison said. “But it’s good to have.” \nAnd to make the most of when you get the chance, as Maddison and Danley did Saturday. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
