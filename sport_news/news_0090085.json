After going 17-0 in the EPC regular season Easton stormed to the championship meet title with 52 points to runner-up Stroudsburg’s 84, and thus collected two big trophies at the meet’s award ceremonies. \nTuesday’s championship meet triumph was something the Rovers had targeted since last year at this time when Parkland edged Easton out. While the Rovers came back the next week to win the District 11 Class AAA championship, the loss to the Trojans rankled. \n“Losing to Parkland was a lot of motivation for us,” said Easton junior quad-captain Alyssa Repsher. “We remembered last year. We wanted two trophies this year.” \nThe Rovers made sure there would be no repeat by placing five runners in the top 17 Tuesday, led by Hammerstone in second place in 19:06, followed by freshman Lauren Maddison (eighth, 19:50); sophomore Katie Ellmaker (10th, 20:00; Repsher (15th, 20:14) and senior Megan Korn (17th, 20:23) \n“I think we improved ourselves mentally and physically from last year, and it showed in this meet,” Korn said. \nEaston coach Bobbi Jo Powell will have a problem when she selects her top seve for the D-11 meet on the same course Oct. 28. \n“We’re 10 deep, and the JV girls are right there too,” Powell said. “This is a good problem to have. These girls have gone two years unbeaten in the league and that’s not easy to do. I think this group just jelled together this year.” \nEaston junior quad-captain Olivia George said a close team in 2014 came even closer this fall. “We had a lot of freshmen come on this team, and I think we had bonded as a team even better than we did last year,” George said. \nWhile Hammerstone is the on-course leader, behind her could come any number of girls in any order, depending on the race, and that’s a huge strength for Easton. \n“We never worry about the order we finish with each other,” George said. “We just want to do the best we can for the team.” \n“Every girl on this team has the team mentality,” Korn said. \nAnd, the way things are going for Easton, every girl might wind up with a trophy, because all the Rovers want is everything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:57:40.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
