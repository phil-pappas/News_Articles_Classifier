Michigan State's Jalen Watts-Jackson grabbed a flubbed punt by O'Neill and lumbered 38 yards into the end zone for a touchdown on the final play of the game, giving No. 7 Michigan State a shocking 27-23 win over No. 12 Michigan. (AP Photo/Tony Ding) \nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz banned his players from Twitter once he realized the potential pratfalls of social media. \nSome of his Big Ten colleagues might start thinking that Ferentz is on to something. \nThe downside to social media again became apparent over the weekend. Michigan athletic director Jim Hackett released an open letter on Sunday urging fans to avoid “thoughtless comments” following Michigan State’s stunning 27-23 win over the Wolverines. \nMuch of negative online chatter focused on Michigan punter Blake O’Neill, whose fumble led to the game-winning touchdown for the Spartans. \nMichigan State coach Mark Dantonio says he’s disappointed with those who bashed O’Neill, adding that one play shouldn’t define a person.
