(AP) - A New Hampshire man has been arrested in connection with the overdose death of a UMass student nearly two years ago.\nEric Sinacori, of Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, was found dead in his Amherst apartment October 4, 2013.\nProsecutors say 27-year-old Derry, New Hampshire, resident Jesse Carrillo was arrested Monday and charged with involuntary manslaughter and distributing heroin. It's unclear if he has an attorney.\nAuthorities say Carrillo, a former UMass graduate student, provided Sinacori with the heroin that caused the overdose.\nSinacori was working as an informant for campus police at the time. He was under investigation on drug charges but police agreed not to press charges if he cooperated with them. The university has since ended the program.\nCarrillo is expected back to Massachusetts for arraignment later this week.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:53:44.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
