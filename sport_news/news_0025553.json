He has a definite test tomorrow,\" the Arsenal boss confirmed. \n\"(Mikel) Arteta and (Mathieu) Flamini are also (now) back in full training. We need to see how they are and how confident they are, but we can't rule it out.\" \nArsenal host the club's Annual General Meeting at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday morning. \nIt has been reported Alisher Usmanov, Arsenal's second largest shareholder, has asked for a detailed explanation of a Â£3million payment to the company of majority owner Stan Kroenke. \nShareholders are also said to be asking pre-submitted questions of the club's transfer strategy, which saw only one addition during the summer window, that of veteran goalkeeper Petr Cech from Chelsea. \nArsenal recently again reported robust financial results, which showed cash reserves of some Â£193.1m. \nWenger will, as usual, address the AGM directly in a speech, while Kroenke, who is a non-executive director, could also front questions along with chief executive Ivan Gazidis and chairman Sir Chips Keswick.
