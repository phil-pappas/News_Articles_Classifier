By Joy Sports \nCAF president Issa Hayatou has begun his reign as interim boss of world governing body FIFA with a promise to \"restore public trust\" in the crisis-rocked organisation. \nThe 69-year-old administrator made his position known after arriving FIFA's headquarters in Zurich on Thursday for the first time since he was named to run the organisation following the suspension of its president Sepp Blatter. \nBlatter, along with UEFA president Michel Platini and FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke, were suspended for 90 days by the world body's ethics committee in the face of ongoing corruption investigations. \n\"It's an unprecedented situation but we remain focused on the necessary reform process,\" said Hayatou. \nThe CAF boss promised to support the current investigations by Swiss and American investigators as well as focus on the upcoming presidential elections that will see a new substantive leader emerge to head FIFA. \nHayatou, who has made it clear he is not interested in carrying on in the role on a permanent basis, noted that it was important to stay true to the body's mission of developing the game worldwide. \n\"It is essential that FIFA carries on its mission of developing the game and staging international tournaments,\" Hayatou said. \nHe will be in Zurich until next week when he will lead the Extraordinary Executive Committee on Tuesday. \nBut can he make any change to this behemoth so steeped in its own ways? \nSlowly, slowlyThe Cameroonian football buff who on arrival addressed staff of the secretariat and got briefings from acting secretary general, Markus Kattner, stated that this is not the best of time for FIFA, but was quick to add that the body will weather the storm. \nIn Hayatou’s words: “It’s certainly an unprecedented situation for FIFA. But we remain focused on the necessary reform process, the Presidential election and on supporting the current investigations. To restore public trust is a crucial objective.” \nActing Secretary General Markus Kattner discussed the main administrational matters with Hayatou and provided an overview of FIFA’s activities over the next few months. \n“Operationally, FIFA is working well, as it should, and the best example is the FIFA U-17 World Cup, which is about to kick-off in Chile”, said Kattner. \n“On top of that, the FIFA World Cup qualifiers are taking place and over one million spectators attended matches this week in Asia. Our football development activities across the globe continue apace and our preparations for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup in Japan and the FIFA Ballon d’Or 2015 are also progressing well.” \nActing President Issa Hayatou will remain in Zurich until next week, when he will lead the Extraordinary Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday 20 October at the Home of FIFA. \nHayatou as the most senior vice president of FIFA took charge in acting capacity following the 90 day suspension of Sepp Blatter alongside UEFA president, Michel Platini. Both men have appealed their ban, insisting that they have done no wrong. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
