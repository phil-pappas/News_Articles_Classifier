For the first timers, this year you’re getting a succinct review. Essentially, we’ll talk fantasy relevant touch, target, and snap count data to help identify any trends that can improve your roster. I’ll try to avoid discussing anything overly obvious (i.e. AJ Green got a lot of targets this week) and stick to that which could provide you with actionable information to help improve your rosters. \nAnything I missed? It’s all being charted, even if it doesn’t make the article. Feel free to get at me on twitter ( @joncollinsFSLR ) or ask in the comments section. \nOne final note: this column uses Pro Football Focus’ ‘thrown at’ data which occasionally differs from a standard ‘target’ count in that it’s charting throws that were truly intended for a receiver, rather than throwaways which may have been aimed in his direction. \n… Onwards. [ Jump to the AFC ] Touches and Targets Week 5: Arizona Cardinals \nThe passing game is hard to analyze, given that Carson Palmer threw just 14 passes in a game that Arizona ran away with. The run game is more intriguing. Again, this one was in the books early but Chris Johnson led the charge with 11 carries, while Andre Ellington and David Johnson each picked up three. Ellington managed to burst for a long score on one, while two of David’s went for short TDs. Again, it was an odd week… but… if David Johnson’s goal line work holds it caps the value on the other two parties, while leaving him as a tough player to trust given the apparent CJ, Ellington, DJ pecking order. Touches and Targets Week 5: Atlanta Falcons Devonta Freeman deservedly remained in his coaches good graces this week (Photo: Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images North America). \nIt wasn’t Matt Ryan ‘s best week, so, production was down across Atlanta’s passing game… but, the most telling stat to me may be Jacob Tamme ‘s 10 targets. Those matched the ten (five receptions) given to Julio Jones , but with Jones and Leonard Hankerson limited, Tamme was a feature of the game plan from the first snap. Meanwhile, Nick Williams got into the mix with four targets, matching veteran Roddy White ‘s total in his ‘squeaky wheel’ week. Leonard Hankerson had four of his own, missing some time due to injury. His final line wasn’t all that exciting (one catch, 13 yards) but three of his four targets came in the endzone so he just missed a big game. To me, he’s still the second man in the pecking order (and that includes Tamme, after his 10/8/94). \nMeanwhile, the run game probably deserved to lead the piece… the challenge is, there isn’t all that much to say that you can’t tell from the box score. Devonta Freeman turned a tough mathcup into fantasy gold yet again, netting 27 carries and seven receptions (on eight targets) for 197 yards. In Tevin Coleman ‘s return, he was given just two carries while Terron Ward was targeted twice and didn’t make a catch. Over time, I’d expect Coleman to take away a few carries – 34 touch weeks won’t be the norm – but at this stage there is little doubt that Freeman is the #1, and, he’s matchup proof until we see otherwise. Touches and Targets Week 5: Chicago Bears \nFile Marquess Wilson ‘s game away for the next time that Eddie Royal and Alshon Jeffery are both out of the lineup – which could, of course, be this week – but otherwise I wouldn’t count on a repeat of this effort. He and Josh Bellamy drew eight targets apiece, with each making six receptions. Wilson turned in a much more effective 85 yards (and a score) on his eight looks, and will remain as the team’s number three, but, when all parties are healthy there aren’t eight looks for him as the third receiver. \nMartellus Bennett was the most targeted Bear, but, couldn’t make much of it. He drew 11 looks from Jay Cutler , but was charged with two drops on a day where there were a number of catchable balls thrown his direction and made just four catches. Of course, Bennett has been a consistent producers, so, we don’t need to read too much into this other than his team leading 11 looks. Touches and Targets Week 5: Dallas Cowboys \nWith Dallas off this week and likely to switch to Matt Cassel during the bye, there isn’t a lot of over analysis needed in the numbers here. Jason Witten and Terrance Williams led the team in targets (six each) as expected, while Cole Beasley worked underneath. \nMeanwhile, Joseph Randle crawled out of the doghouse to net 19 touches (4/4 receiving, with 15 carries for 60 yards). The story of the day, though, was that Darren McFadden ate up all of Lance Dunbar ‘s targets in the wake of Dunbar’s injury. He drew 10, catching nine balls, and delivering a PPR healthy 73 total yards. Christine Michael was given just one carry. Again, a swap to Cassel may change that but it looks like McFadden is slated to make waves in the passing game. Touches and Targets Week 5: Detroit Lions \nAmeer Abdullah had trouble holding onto the ball this week. Its hard to know whether that fact, or, the fact that Detroit let the game get away from them led to Zach Zenner ‘s 10 carries (for 30 yards) and two targets vs. his own six and two. It certainly is a situation to monitor, and, leaves the door open for Joique Bell to hang onto a role when he returns to the lineup. \nMeanwhile, in the passing game Golden Tate made eight catches on 15 targets, Corey Fuller factored into the mix (three targets, two catches) and Lance Moore went 8/5/55/TD while Calvin Johnson drew just six PFF targets and made five catches. Again, they were out of the game early and Matthew Stafford was ineffective, but, owners won’t like seeing Johnson as the third man in the pecking order – fourth when you account for a 13 target, 10 catch, very DFS friendly day from Theo Riddick . Detroit’s schedule softens a bit over the next month, but it may be now or never for Johnson (and Stafford…). Touches and Targets Week 5: Green Bay Packers \nTy Mongtomery drew five targets with Davante Adams out of the lineup again – more than James Jones ‘ three, and just one fewer than Randall Cobb – making four catches for 59 yards and scoring a virtually uncontested 31 yard TD. Still, with eight targets going to Richard Rodgers this week, and with Adams due back, I won’t get overly excited. In fact, I’ve already recommended you checking out Flea Market Montgomery this week. Still, the emergence of Rodgers and Montgomery, and the non-stop-TD-machineness of Jones is impacting Randall Cobb’s value. 39 targets through five games is nothing to shake a stick at, but, it’s not the volume that was projected for Cobb when owners made him an early round pick. style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" data-ad-slot=\"1507870491\"> Touches and Targets Week 5: New Orleans Saints \nWith Marques Colston a near-sure bet to miss the coming week, and perhaps more, Willie Snead ‘s role takes on added relevance. While it was Brandin Cooks (9/5/107/TD) that scored the garbage time TD, Snead was engaged all day. He finished with a team-leading 11 targets for six receptions and 141 yards. That gives him 20 over the past two weeks as he has become a significant part of the passing game. \nMeanwhile, after CJ Spiller made some noise to close out Week 4 he drew the start in Week 5 but really didn’t see a lot of the field. In fact, he totaled just four targets and three carries (one touch fewer than Khiry Robinson who picked up five carries) with Mark Ingram firmly in control of the work as expected. Four targets for Spiller meant less work for Ingram in the passing game (12 carries, three targets, two receptions) but we knew that was coming anyway. In a game where New Orleans doesn’t fall behind so badly in the second half, he’ll get an even greater share of the work. Touches and Targets Week 5: New York Giants \nNew York’s receiving group was hit with a rash of injuries on Sunday night, though, Odell Beckham Jr. still managed a big-time bounce back game and finished with seven catches on 11 targets. Rueben Randle (six targets) joined him on the sideline at one point, and the next man up was Dwayne Harris . In truth, we don’t need to go too much deeper than that ( Geremy Davis had a catch…), but, with eight targets, six receptions and 72 yards Harris was the biggest beneficiary – something worth noting if either starter is forced to miss time – assuming Victor Cruz doesn’t return. \nLarry Donnell (7/6/35 and the game winning TD) and Shane Vereen also benefited. Vereen played on 49% of the snaps, his second highest total of the season, and caught all eight of his pass targets for an impressive 86 yards, adding 24 on the ground. That easily topped Rashad Jennings in terms of production, though the starter had 15 combined touches (11 carries, 4/4 as a receiver). Andre Williams netted 0 yards on three catches. Williams, of course, is the only member you can’t really expect much involvement from on a regular basis, and even he’ll sneak in with some work from time to time as his 40 carries will attest. Still, while Vereen was written out of the game plan a week ago with New York up big, he was very much involved given the back and forth nature of this contest. Game flow is tough to predict – if we knew which games New York we’d be running out the clock in, we’d all be rich – but you can make an educated guess, and, the games where they trail are the games where you’ll be most interested in Vereen. Touches and Targets Week 5: Philadelphia Eagles \nThere’s nothing like a date with the Saints to cure what ails you offensively, and the Eagles took full advantage this week. The big story line is DeMarco Murray , who hadn’t been productive and had grieved about his workload heading into the week. He finished with 27 touches and 120 yards (with a score) on 20 carries and seven receptions from eight targets. Those numbers are excellent, and, are what we grew accustomed to from Murray last year. \nI’d be remiss in not mentioning that Ryan Mathews , who made three receptions and picked up eight carries also found the endzone and fell just 24 yards behind Murray… and further so if I didn’t note that the offense looked much more fluid with Mathews’ attacking running style leading the charge than when Murray was in the lineup, but, for now Murray will remain the workhorse. A date with the Giants this Monday isn’t all that intimidating, so, another 20ish touch productive outing could be in the offing for Murray. \nDarren Sproles checked in with a catch (two targets) and six carries. \nIn the passing game, Jordan Matthews drew seven targets, and caught five balls (for 44 yards) while producing a drop. Those drops, unfortunately, are becoming customary and could cost him looks in the long term. In fact, Riley Cooper led the team this week, though, he caught just three of his eight balls from Mark Sanchez which is pretty typically Cooper. He doesn’t pose a long term threat to Matthews, but, he’ll play a role in keeping Nelson Agholor very quiet this season. Josh Huff , it seems, wants to play a hand in that too. Huff was engaged throughout the game for Philly and actually felt more involved than his five targets would suggest, if that’s possible. The Oregon product has been a player of interest for two years now, and, his 5/4/78 outing (with a score) could earn him continued work. Touches and Targets Week 5: St. Louis Rams \nTodd Gurley , Todd Gurley, Todd Gurley, Tavon Austin . \nThat’s about all you need to know. Gurley didn’t see a pass target this week, but, played nearly 2/3 of the snaps (63%) for St. Louis this week and picked up 30 carries, giving him 51 over the past two weeks. You don’t need me to tell you he’s been productive, nor do you need me to tell you that it spells the end for Tre Mason , who has played four snaps the last two weeks. \nBenny Cunningham is hanging around, but, Gurley should take on an increasing share of the overall offensive play count – his blocking looks fine, just ask Clay Matthews – in coming weeks and really looks like a do it all kind of guy. Cunningham had just two targets this week. This is the Gurley show. \nMeanwhile, Tavon Austin was again used to create a few lanes for Gurley and take advantage of stacked fronts. He had three carries, and two receptions on four targets, though his TD really was a rush play. In any event, five touches isn’t a huge workload for him, but, he’s been productive in recent weeks and the team continues to find ways to get him involved. He’ll be a boom/bust candidate, but, he’s shown a lot of boom potential and looks good with Gurley in the lineup. \nElsewhere, Jared Cook drew three targets and made just one catch. Stedman Bailey went 5/3/73, making two straight weeks his finished well ahead of Kenny Britt in targets and production, after Britt’s 100 yard Week 3. Touches and Targets Week 5: Seattle Seahawks \nThomas Rawls made up for a poor effort in Week 4 with a strong one against a tough defense in Cincinnati this week. Marshawn Lynch returns for Week 6, however, so that run is over. All told, Rawls had 23 carries for 169 yards this week and finishes with 40 and 217 in his two week run in place of Lynch. He’s worth a roster spot as a handcuff, but, I’d expect Fred Jackson who played on 37% of the offensive snaps this week and picked up three catches on three targets to be the first man in behind Lynch most of the time. Rawls doesn’t have value without a Lynch injury. \nIn the passing game, it was another disappointing week for Jimmy Graham who saw just four targets and made three receptions, giving him 59 yards and six catches since his solid Week 3 outing. He’ll face the league’s least generous TE defense in Week 6. \nAt WR, Jermaine Kearse scored the TD this week after it was Doug Baldwin a week ago, and that fact is what makes the pair nearly impossible to use. They split six targets evenly, with Kearse catching two balls and the score and Baldwin catching all three for 70 yards. Meanwhile – and again, it’s tough to use anyone here – Tyler Lockett actually led the group in targets for the second straight week, with four (two catches, 29 yards). Touches and Targets Week 5: San Francisco 49ers \nWith 11 targets, eight receptions and 107 yards the 49ers kept things simple and drove their passing game through Anquan Boldin this week. He had a solid aDot of 16.7 so it wasn’t like they were all short, easy routes, but they trusted the veteran and his connection with Kaepernick. Torrey Smith had just two targets, with Quinton Patton seeing three short ones and TE Garrett Celek drawing four with Vernon Davis out. \nMoving forward, while this was San Francisco’s best game since the opener, I don’t trust the offense much. It’s Boldin then no one, for me, as it was for the ‘Niners this week. Touches and Targets Week 5: Tampa Bay Buccaneers \nTampa managed to roll up 38 points without throwing the ball (read: by hiding Jameis Winston ). That won’t always be a workable recipe, but, the offense definitely looked better with just five targets (three catches) for Mike Evans and three targets (one catch) for Vincent Jackson than it did with 22 between them in each of the past two weeks. \nAgain, that only worked because Doug Martin and Charles Sims were rolling, something made easier by a date with an opponent against whom they could keep it close. All told, Martin finished with three receptions on three targets for 35 yards, with a score in that phase, and 24 carries for 123 yards and two TDs as a rusher. Sims, who played on 39% of the snaps, pitched in a 4/4 receiving day with 85 yards and produced 66 yards on his 12 carries. 36 totes between them won’t be par for the course, but, leaning on the run game (particularly early) should be. It’s bad news for Evans/Jackson owners, but, its a reality given the shaky QB play they’ve seen so far. \nTampa is off this week, but, I’m projecting more of the same coming out of the bye. Touches and Targets Week 5: Washington \nIt was another quiet week from Alfred Morris , who had eight carries for 15 yards against the Falcons and played just 23% of the team’s snaps. Chris Thompson again led the team in that category, and racked up seven targets for six receptions and 33 yards (plus, three carries for 15). It was Matt Jones , though, who led the group in touches with 12, including 11 carries for an equally underwhelming 20 yards (with a score). \nMoving forward, all I really know out of this group is that I can’t trust Alf, and, Thompson is getting the late game/PPR value. As for Jones, there is upside and its nice to see him with work around the goalline again, but, he appears to be splitting early down work with Morris and hasn’t run all that efficiently. \nOnto the passing game, with Jordan Reed out, Derek Carrier picked up the slack, receiving three targets and catching two for an early score. We all know Reed’s issues staying on the field, so, Carrier could be a decent fill-in or DFS play when the starter misses time. \nAt WR, Jamison Crowder did his thing again. He was targeted eight times, and secured all eight for 87 yards. That brings his season total to 23 receptions on 26 targets including 21/24 in his last three games. While DeSean Jackson ‘s return could change his role, Crowder needs to be rostered in deeper formats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:18:53.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
