Troops in the first World War used it during close-quarter trench warfare to not only stab but also bludgeon enemies with the handle, according to military historians.\nThe Police Bureau tries to return evidence to its rightful owner, but police couldn't determine who owned the knife, said Ty Routley, manager of the property evidence warehouse.\nOfficers found it in a home where several people were living among many other items, including guns, tools, fishing equipment, money and drugs.\nThe person arrested in the case is a convicted felon who couldn't get the knife back even if he had owned it, Routley said.\n\"Instead of throwing it away, someone saw the date on it and suggested it be donated,'' Routley said. \"When we discovered how old it was, someone Googled and found this museum. We have donated historically significant items in the past and thought this one was a good candidate as well.''\nSometimes the bureau auctions off surplus property that no one claims and the money goes back to the bureau's general fund, Routley said.\nThe National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Mo., has worked with other police departments to preserve historical objects. Its website shows images of paintings, uniforms, gas masks, medals and other memorabilia from all nations that were involved in World War I.\nThe nonprofit museum has been collecting property since 1920. Donated items are used by researchers to better understand the conditions and impact of the war and remain part of the museum's collection, according to the museum's website.\nIn fact, the museum is looking for any of these items: a European U-boat and navy uniforms, state and county personnel rosters and American women's military uniforms.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://theworldwar.org/", "https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-21T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:37:09.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
