(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) In a move that could possibly reverse the Cubs' curse, the New York Mets prematurely predicted their own trip to the World Series one game shy of clinching the NLCS. On Wednesday afternoon, just hours before the Cubs take on the Mets in a do-or-die Game 4, the Mets' website briefly advertised World Series Mets gear. According to ESPN , the website declared the Mets \"National League Champions\" and advertised an orange and blue t-shirt emblazoned with \"The Pennant Will Rise.\" Cubs Set Game 3 Lineup vs. Mets Jay Horwitz, vice president of media relations for the Mets, told ESPN the advertisement was a \"glitch,\" and it soon disappeared from the site. The Mets are leading the Cubs 3-0 in the NLCS, but they still need one more win to get to the World Series.
