Reversal of misfortune: O shines as D dims. Ohio State bowl eligible ... so there’s that. Terps played shell of a game for 2 1/2 quarters.\nPregame buzz: Most of the talk was on the Maryland side of the ball, where rumors swirled that coach Randy Edsall was about to go Ford Edsel and be discontinued. Otherwise, would Cardale Jones finally step up? Answer: J.T. Barrett’s red-zone production may have overshadowed Jones, but 12 Gauge played his best game with 291 passing yards and no turnovers.\nThe $79 question: Maryland was not supposed to turn Ohio Stadium into not-so-Merryland, but it was 21-21 in the third quarter. Then the OSU offense decided it actually is legal to throw the ball downfield. And disaster averted.\nOne-liner: As coach Urban Meyer likes to say, “The best thing about being 6-0 is the chance to find yourself in another closer-than-it-should-be game next week.”\nJust wondering: Is Buckeye Nation worried about Michigan?\nThe view How the team sees it: Eventually, we made MD look more like a Ph.D and didn’t let them operate.\nHow the pollsters will see it: Ohio State is like a restaurant with terrible service but tasty food: You want to cross it off the list, but there’s just enough good to keep you coming back.\nHow Buckeye Nation will see it: We’re OK with Meyer turning us into Florida 2006, with J.T. playing the part of Tebow. As long as we get the same result.\nUrban dictionary What he said: “We made a strong emphasis on turnovers and execution.”\nWhat it means: “We said, ‘If you turn it over, be prepared to hang for it.’ ”\nIf this were an Aesop’s Fable The Tortoise and the hairy for a while .\nThey said it Your turn/the channel: Glen Mason of the Big Ten Network calls games like he’s watching the last 10 seconds of the Kentucky Derby. AND DOWN THE STRETCH CARDALE COMES! Mase brings energy, I’ll say that. He also brings butchered pronunciations. Viewers pointed out some of the doozies. Jason Laipply noted, “Mason at it again. ‘Carless Hyde.’ You can’t make this stuff up.” And Keith Arnold jumped in with “Glen Mason is already on fire. ‘Gotta stop Zekey Elliott from A-hi-a State.’ ”\nAs heard from stadium usher: The feel from the crowd is, “We can’t believe we’re No. 1.”\nSGM to female fan working crossword puzzle during game: What’s an eight-letter word for underachievers? Begins with a “B.”\nNumbers for dummies 4: Times that Meyer said “swing” or “swinging” during postgame comments. Must have been the word of the week at practice. Either that or he’s watching a lot of playoff baseball.\n87: Career touchdowns in which Braxton Miller has been directly involved (pass, run, catch) — an OSU record.\nOn tap The Buckeyes will wear black uniforms when Penn State visits the Horseshoe on Saturday, so the OSU marketing machine is calling the game “Dark Night at the Shoe.” Better idea? “Dark Knight at the Shoe,” because the Nittany Lions have looked like Jokers.\nTweethearts Best responses to @rollerCD on Twitter :\n@bhammy27: Welcome to #BuckeyeNation where we can be disappointed in being 6-0 and Bowl Eligible.\n@mdustmanmagic: It appears OSU’s coaching staff finally found the pages that were stuck together in the playbook and peeled them apart.\n@ylbcore: Cardale throwing it deep to keep JT off the field #noredzoneforyou\n@themostbrian: PRO: Most dangerous remaining opponents (PSU, MSU, UM) don’t have running QB.\n@cathywf: every game is like a blind date. No idea how it is going to turn out.\n@Buckmich1: If Urban says Maryland is a good team I am going to puke. No\n@Gymratt1: Better team as the hunter than the hunted!!! Just tough to watch\nHorseshoe haiku Barrett takes a knee \nA better ending for some? \nJ.T. takes the job \nroller@dispatch.com \n@rollerCD", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:21:01.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
