I give the glory to God and my faith. A lot of the ebbs and flows of being a coach in the sport of football, we’ve experienced it all. I’m so happy for my kids and for our campus, it’s just a good win.” \nThe Lobos scored 20 unanswered points during the second half to net their first win of the season. \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
