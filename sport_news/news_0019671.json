Jeff Munn has lingered in the background long enough. As a very, very, very, very huge fan of Vin Scully since 1952, I am a very huge fan of Jeff Munn. His sound (and knowledge of baseball trivia) is so reminiscent of Vinnie at a younger age. Thank you, Jeff, for your patience in waiting for the D-backs to give you an opportunity beyond pre- and post-game. Jeff was kind enough to respond to an email I sent him some years ago, asking how long he would wait. He was a company man all the way in his response. The Guv'nor, Greg Schulte, is a Phoenix institution and, happily, won his bout with cancer. He is a fixture. I wish Munny the best in his career and hope he lands a good position as a radio play-by-play voice within Major League baseball.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:23:59.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
