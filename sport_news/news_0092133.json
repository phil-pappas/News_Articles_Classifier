In doing so, it provides added protection and comfort. It also improves worker safety. The invention features a dual-function design that is convenient and easy to use so it is ideal for use by industrial workers, trades people, construction laborers, maintenance personnel, landscapers and do-it-yourselfers. Additionally, the SAFETY MUFFS is producible in design variations and a prototype is available.\nThe inventor, from Noblesville, Ind., described his inspiration for the invention. “I have to wear safety glasses and earmuffs for work but I find it inconvenient to wear them both at the same time. I thought there needed to be a more comfortable design, so I created my prototype.”\nThe original design was submitted to the Indianapolis office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
