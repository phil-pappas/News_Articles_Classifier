It's an effort to keep my pronouns straight and to remember to use \"cisgender\" instead of \"normal\" when referring to those whose gender identity has always matched the genitals with which they were born.\nMy first impulse, upon hearing of the controversy at Northwest Suburban High School District 211 involving a transgender girl who wants unrestricted access to the girls' athletic locker room, was to consider the privacy concerns of the cisgender girls who also use that locker room.\nParenting a transgender child — new fears, same love Louis Porter II Even when my child was an infant, I had a premonition that our precious baby girl was going to throw some curveballs our way.

If District 211 doesn't drop the requirement and integrate her into the locker-room setting, it risks losing more than $6 million a year in federal funding.\nMissouri students protest transgender teen's use of girl's locker room Michael E.

She was featured on the cover of Vanity Fair and received an ESPY award for courage.\nBut even as Jenner starred in a reality TV docu-series about her transition,...\n(Michael E. Miller) The requirement \"reflects a parent concern, not a kid concern,\" said American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois staff attorney John Knight, who represents the student and directs the ACLU's LGBT & HIV Project.\n\"Kids know transgender students and tend to be quite accepting of them,\" Knight said. \"They see this kind of transitioning all the time among their peers and generally don't have a problem with it. And for those (students) who do have a problem, we think the school should give them separate, private places to dress, not impose a requirement on transgender students.\"\nKnight argues that forcing transgender students into changing stalls serves to marginalize and isolate them — to suggest, in this case, \"that she isn't really a girl.\"\nAnd indeed that very suggestion — that there is something trivial, phony or even prurient about transgenderism — appears to be the animating spirit behind conservative legislative efforts around the country to prohibit people from using restrooms or changing facilities that don't align with their chromosomal or birth gender.\nBut it's that suggestion that rings false.\nMy second impulse in reacting to this story is to admire the courage of this girl in making her transition and to acknowledge that no one would ever go through such a difficult process simply in hopes of getting a peek at some private parts.\nFor all practical purposes, she really is a girl. And, ultimately, balking at that, insinuating otherwise, is not reasonable.\nSchools and other public accommodations need to transition as well by providing locker-room privacy stalls for anyone who wants them and unisex bathrooms for those somewhere in the middle of the gender spectrum.\nIt's a new era. Some of us are entering it more slowly than others, but we're getting there.\nTwitter: @ ericzorn\n Commentary Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55e9dbdc/turbine/ct-parenting-transgender-children-20150903", "http://www.twitter.com/ericzorn", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5620246b/turbine/ct-transgender-student-locker-district-211-lgbt-perspec-zorn-1016-jm-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55e74cab/turbine/ct-transgender-teen-girls-locker-room-20150902"], "published": "2015-10-16T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:38:33.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
