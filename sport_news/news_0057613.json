He has struck out 12 and walked none. \nThe Mets' only runner reached on a throwing error by third baseman Yunel Escobar on Kevin Plawecki's leadoff grounder in the sixth. \nScherzer has thrown 80 pitches on a brisk, blustery night at Citi Field in the second game of a day-night doubleheader. Washington leads 2-0. \nThis was the fifth time this season that Scherzer took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning. The 2013 AL Cy Young winner with Detroit is in his first year with the Nationals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T04:23:40.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
