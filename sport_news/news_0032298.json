He span off late in the session but avoided the wall.\nThe first half-hour of the 90-minute session was lost as track crews cleaned up a fuel spill left by a service vehicle. A large part of the circuit remained slippery, slowing cars down significantly. Light rain also fell toward the end of the session.\nRain is possible during the second practice session, which takes place later Friday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
