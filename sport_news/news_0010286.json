(AP) - A New York Air National Guard unit's annual mission to the South Pole has begun after being delayed by maintenance problems with a cargo plane.\nNational Guard officials say an LC-130 cargo plane and its crew from the 109th Airlift Wing departed early Friday afternoon from Stratton Air National Guard Base in Schenectady County.\nThe departure was originally scheduled for 9 a.m. but was delayed because of maintenance problems with the aircraft.\nThe unit is heading for McMurdo Station in Antarctica, where it will support the National Science Foundation for the 28th season of Operation Deep Freeze.\nThe 109th is the only unit in the U.S. military that flies ski-equipped LC-130s capable of landing on snow and ice. During the South Pole mission, a total of seven \"Skibirds\" and about 500 airmen are expected to be deployed, with 330-plus missions planned.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:52:58.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
