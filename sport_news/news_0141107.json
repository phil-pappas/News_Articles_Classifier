Signal photo by Katharine Lotze A A A \nThe Hart, West Ranch girls volleyball match at Hart High School on Thursday night was nothing short of a battle.But when Madi Fay terminated the final kill of the game from the right side for the Indians, she lifted her squad to a 3-2 win over the Wildcats (25-23, 25-27, 25-16, 19-25, 15-11).“I really wanted that last set,” said Fay, who had six kills and four blocks on the night. “All I thought about was my team’s reaction afterward and putting that ball away.”Hart and West Ranch traded the first four games, with the Indians nabbing the first and third games, and the Wildcats rebounded each time.Fay and Brooke Boron opened up the scoring for Hart in the final game with a block on Tasha Skabelund, who had the final three kills for West Ranch to push the match to a tie-breaking game.The Wildcats took their first lead, 10-9, of the fifth game after the Indians had two straight errors on kill attempts.But Hart head coach Mary Keen called a timeout to settle the players down.“I remember a couple people saying, ‘This is our league title. This is our game, our home court,’” Fay said. “We just put that in our minds. That kind of gave us the extra boost we needed to win that game.”The boost helped Boron hit a desperation shot on a 3-ball that dropped down for the tying score.After a Sarah Coblentz ace and a free ball from the deep end of the court, the Indians led 13-11.“I’ll give it to West Ranch,” Keen said. “They were digging and hitting well. It wasn’t a pretty, but a win is a win.”Colbentz had a match-high 14 kills, added 16 digs and four aces. Lexi Chabiniak tallied 12 kills for Hart, which moves to 9-4 overall and 6-1 in the Foothill League.Annika Bergstrom had 13 kills and five aces for the West Ranch. Skabelund and Natalie Ferrera each had 10 kills and two aces, while Kaitlin Schultz tallied six blocks.“This was the best performance we’ve had all season,” said West Ranch head coach Brandon Pank, whose team moves to 7-10-1 overall and 3-4 in league. “Even though we lost, we get to walk away feeling like we achieved something because we played such great volleyball.” \nGolden Valley 3, Canyon 2 Golden Valley was able to sneak by Canyon in a five-game set Thursday night by scores of 25-22, 20-25, 16-25, 25-20, 16-14.In the last game the Grizzlies were serving for the match at 14-13 but a service error tied it up. Golden Valley rebounded with a Sydney Overton kill and an Emiley Grose short serve to end the match at 16-14.The Grizzlies (4-12 overall, 2-5 league) were led by Nereida Meza and Kelsey Bauer, who had 11 kills and 10 kills, respectively, and Ciera McGuinness had 41 assists.Canyon (2-14, 0-7) was led by Sasha Oakley’s 14 kills. Sally Hyde added four kills and two blocks, while Rachel Lindvall 18 digs. \nValencia 3, Saugus 0 Valencia (16-7 overall, 7-0 league) swept Saugus by scores of 25-15, 25-13, 25-11 Thursday at Valencia High on Thursday.Opposite Emily Burns led the Vikings’ attack with eight kills, while Kelsey Knudsen added seven.Outside hitter Lauren Russ only had five kills on the night, but tallied seven aces and 10 digs for Valencia. Demi Dawson also had 10 digs on the night.Jessica Jimenez tallied 10 kills for the Centurions (11-12, 3-4), and Grace Ferguson notched seven kills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:32:56.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
