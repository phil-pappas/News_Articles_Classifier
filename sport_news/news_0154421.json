Courtesy Charlene Walker i Order Reprint of this Story \nA 7-year-old Kennewick boy is recovering after he was injured in a seven-car pileup over the weekend that killed his baby brother. \nAidan Cástañeda was flown to Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane following the Oct. 10 crash on Highway 221 south of Prosser. \n“Aidan has improved. He is out of critical condition,” said Charlene Walker, a family friend. “He’s talking and walking. He’s doing really good.” \nA dust storm caused the pileup, which injured seven people, including Tyler Jayce Roy, an 8-month-old Kennewick boy. Tyler was pronounced dead at PMH Medical Center in Prosser. \nThe boys and their mother, Jamie M. Haren, 26, were headed south on the highway at County Well Road when the chain-reaction crash happened. \nWalker told the Herald that Haren and her fiance, Josh Roy, are struggling with Tyler’s death, but thankful that Aidan survived. \nTyler was the Kennewick couple’s first child together. \n“They are taking it really hard,” Walker said. “It’s going to take them a long time.” \nWalker started a GoFundMe account for the family for funeral costs, to offset medical bills and to help buy the family a new vehicle. The minivan the family recently bought was totaled in the crash. \nHaren is a longtime employee of the Dairy Queen at Columbia Center mall in Kennewick and Roy works for a Richland food service company, Walker said. Haren is hoping to complete a degree in criminal justice from Washington State University. \nThe GoFundMe account had raised almost $4,000 of the $10,000 goal by Wednesday night. \n“We would just like to make sure everything is covered for them,” Walker said. \nAn account has also been set up in Jamie Haren’s name at HAPO Community Credit Union branches. \nTo donate to the GoFundMe account, go to https://www.gofundme.com/m76bbxc4 . \nTyler Richardson: 509-582-1556; trichardson@tricityherald.com ; Twitter: @Ty_richardson Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:17:19.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
