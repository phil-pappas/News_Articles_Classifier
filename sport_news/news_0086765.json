This is going to sit with us all forever – players, coaches, management,” Lancaster said. \n“I don’t think I’ll ever come to terms with it personally because it was such a big thing. \n“I’ve had some great moments coaching England and I’ve had some disappointing ones, but this pales everything else into insignificance because of what the tournament means to everyone.” \nEngland’s scrum fell to pieces on Saturday night, conceding three first-half penalties as respected French referee Romain Poite came down hard on their loosehead prop Joe Marler for boring in at an angle. \nMarler was hooked after 50 minutes following a terse exchange with Poite about coming in at an angle after he’d conceded a fourth penalty.
