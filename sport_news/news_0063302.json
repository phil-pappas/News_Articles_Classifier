(AP) — Boxer Prichard Colon was in critical condition Sunday after suffering a brain bleed from an injury during a bout in northern Virginia, an official said. \nColon underwent surgery to relieve pressure on his brain after his bout Saturday afternoon against Terrel Williams in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Fairfax, Virginia, said Lou DiBella, president of DiBella Entertainment. \nWithin moments of showing symptoms in his dressing room after the fight, Colon was under the care of emergency medical technicians and rushed to Inova Fairfax hospital, DiBella said. \n“He suffered a brain bleed as a result of an injury during the bout and underwent immediate surgery to relieve pressure on his brain,” DiBella said in a statement. “His condition remains critical.” \nColon was knocked down twice in the ninth round, the second time just before the bell by a right hand. In a bizarre sequence, he went back to his corner and the cornermen started taking off his gloves, believing it had been the 10th and final round. As Colon sat on his stool, they realized their mistake and began putting the gloves back on again, but referee Joseph Cooper disqualified him. \nColon, who was a rising star from Puerto Rico in the super welterweight division, left the ring under his own power but became dizzy and nauseous in his dressing room. \nHe was undefeated in 16 fights and favored against Williams in the semi-main event that was televised by NBC.
