(Scott Heavey/PA via AP) UNITED KINGDOM OUT - NO SALES - NO ARCHIVES \nLONDON (AP) — Second-half goals from Alexis Sanchez, Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey guided Arsenal to a 3-0 win at Watford on Saturday that kept the team in second place in the Premier League. \nSanchez’s goal came in the 62nd minute when Mesut Ozil was tackled in the penalty area, only for the ball to roll onto the Chilean’s feet for him to lift over Heurehlo Gomes and into the net off the post. \nSix minutes later, Olivier Giroud fired a cut-back from Ozil into the roof of the net before Ramsey added a third following a neat pass from Hector Bellerin. \nWatford had promising spells of possession throughout the game but its momentum was lost with three goals in 12 minutes from Arsenal.
