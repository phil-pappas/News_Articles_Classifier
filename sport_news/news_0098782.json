Abe Felix — who won the TSSAA’s Mr. Football Award in 2002 after a record-setting career at Houston — has died at the age of 30.\nHis death was announced at Houston’s game against Arlington Friday. No other details were available.\n“He was a one of a kind player,” said Tim Haney, who coached Felix at Houston. “And he was a very good person. He was never in any kind of trouble and everybody loved him.\n“He was the one that really got Houston football over the hump — he was our only Mr. Football — and he got the program to where it is today.”\nListed at just 5-6 and 172 pounds, Felix led the Shelby-Metro area in rushing in 2001, finishing with 1,788 yards during the regular season. That year, he also set the area record for carries in a season (373) as Houston finished 10-4 and advanced to the state semifinals before losing to Hendersonville.\nThe next year, Felix was named 5A Mr. Football and also won the Pepsi Best of the Preps player of the year award after gaining 1,818 yards and scoring 22 touchdowns. He remains Houston’s all-time leading rusher.\nfter graduating, he was a standout performer at Northeast Mississippi before finishing his career at West Georgia.", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/200*279/abe_felix.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/abe_felix.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:27:30.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
