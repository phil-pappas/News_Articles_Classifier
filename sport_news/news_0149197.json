But there is a lawsuit pending. I'm sure my colleagues are aware of it,\" he said.\nRamos and the city have been sued by a woman who claims he sexually harassed her following a Chamber of Commerce mixer in January.\nRELATED: Woman claiming sexual assault sues Murrieta, mayor\nFollowing the announcement of her claims, the chamber looked into the actions by Ramos at other chamber events and suspended his membership.\nThe city's investigation, which focused on potential violations of the city's Code of Conduct, resulted in an 81-page document that was released this week .\nThe report contains allegations of inappropriate interactions with staff members, including telling an employee she would be fired after he fired the city manager, and numerous mentions of him hitting on, or trying to pick up, women at official functions.\nRamos said Thursday he planned to continue serving as a council member no matter what the council decided Thursday.\n“I am looking forward, right after this meeting, to move forward,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvx71o-ramos11.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvx71o-ramos11.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:17:21.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
