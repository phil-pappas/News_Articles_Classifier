The 15-year-old was not on the team at the time. \nOrr-Mathews’ case was not listed in court records and The Associated Press was unable to determine if he has an attorney. \nHenry Ford is part of the Education Achievement Authority, Michigan’s turnaround district for low-performing public schools. \nA district spokesman says a complaint was made to another member of the team’s coaching staff who contacted school officials. Police then were notified. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:53:22.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
