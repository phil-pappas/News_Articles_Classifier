The university also argues that the plaintiffs have not provided proof of the racial discrimination they allege. \nIn the lawsuit, filed in July, the players accuse basketball coach Matt Bollant and former assistant coach Mike Divilbiss of violating their civil rights by creating a racially hostile environment. The players, five of whom are black and two of whom are white, claim that separate practices held for less-favored players were intended to segregate players. The players also claim discipline was more severe for black players, among other things. \n\"Plaintiffs have failed to plead any facts that plausibly establish race discrimination within the women's basketball program — a threshold requirement under the law to sustain any of the claims alleged,\" university attorneys argue in the motion. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
