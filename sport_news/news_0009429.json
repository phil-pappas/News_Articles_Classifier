It was cloudy and 16 C outside at first pitch — a day, like Thursday, that wasn’t the prettiest, but also was one Jays’ fans are accustomed to enjoying in open air.\nIn the post-season, however, it is Major League Baseball, not the Jays, who make the final decision on whether the roof will be open or closed. The league consults with the club, but ultimately makes the determination itself, and it would seem that MLB has a lower threshold than the Jays for what constitutes inclement weather.\nToronto city councillor Norm Kelly was among the most vocal fans calling for the dome to be opened on Friday.\n“The whole friggin’ country wants it, ‪@MLB,” he wrote from his official Twitter account. “Open the damn dome!! ‪#OpenTheDome.”\nWhere baseball fans in Toronto see the retractable roof has a necessary evil given the city’s climate, MLB — which prioritizes lucrative TV coverage and a non-overlapping playoff schedule — looks at the roof as a luxury that ensures there will be no weather-related delays or interruptions.\nSo from MLB’s point of view, if there is any doubt about the weather — such as the rain forecast for the late evening on Thursday or the clouds on Friday — it would rather just keep it closed and eliminate even the smallest potential for a delay.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:11:37.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
