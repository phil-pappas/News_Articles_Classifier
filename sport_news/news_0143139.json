Minnesota United FC owner Bill McGuire and his investors are seeking tax breaks for the stadium site, which would require legislative action next year.\nAnd even if a lease agreement is reached, the final decision on a stadium location for the Minnesota United FC team would still have to be made by Major League Soccer.\nMcGuire and the investment group have said they would foot the costs of building the 18,500-seat stadium, estimated to be about $120 million. That is the condition under which the St. Paul City Council has said it would favor exempting the site from property taxes.\nThe city would own the soccer stadium once it’s built, under the terms of the joint powers agreement to be considered next week. And the Met Council would continue to own the property, which would be developed with facilities such as kiosks, plazas, walkways and other transit-friendly amenities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:22:44.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
