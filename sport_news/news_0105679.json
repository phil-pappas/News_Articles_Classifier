This is awesome.\"\nAfter Na made a mess of the second extra hole, Grillo had the luxury of two-putting for victory, but he needed only one, ensuring he would be remembered for more than being the guy who nearly hit McIlroy.\nEarlier, Grillo (69) and Na (70) finished at 15-under-par 273, one stroke ahead of Americans Jason Bohn and Justin Thomas and South African Tyrone Van Aswegen.\nBohn held the sole lead with three holes left, but chunked a pitch shot at the par-five 16th and made bogey.\nVan Aswegen barely made his tee time after waking up dizzy and going to hospital in an ambulance.\n\"I was not in good shape,\" he told Golf Channel. \"They filled me with two bags of fluid and said I had severe dehydration and vertigo.\n\"If you go to the ER (emergency room), nothing's quick. I was trying to speed them along. I was still in the hospital bed an hour before the tee time. Thank goodness there was a slight fog delay.\"\nOvernight leader Brendan Steele plunged out of contention with five bogeys in a six-hole stretch on the back nine. He shot 76 to tie for 17th on 10-under, one stroke better than McIlroy (69).\n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:58:51.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
