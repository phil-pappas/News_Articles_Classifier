He was working as a scout for the Packers and was beginning to enjoy the scouting life. Bowles had not thought much about coaching before that, but now here was Williams, the hero of Super Bowl XXII, asking him to join him.\n“I was thinking, ‘Doug Williams, he could ask 500 other guys. Why me?’” Bowles said in a quiet moment this week. “He said he watched me every day in practice and he thought I’d be the perfect guy to run the defense. He saw me quarterback the defense and knew I could do it.\n“He believed in me before I did.”\nBefore long, others would see what Williams saw. Bowles spent one year with Williams at Morehouse and two more at Grambling State before Jets coach Al Groh called to offer him the secondary coaching job, beginning an NFL coaching career that led him to becoming the Jets head coach this winter.\nAll Bowles has done in nine months on the job is transform the culture of the team, expertly manage every crisis that has come across his desk and manage to keep expectations in check despite a 3-1 start.\nBowles handles the highs and the lows with the same poker face.\n“I watch him on the sideline at games,” Williams said. “You don’t see him screaming. You don’t see him in people’s faces. You don’t see him yelling. Not that he’s not upset, but he knows how to compose himself.”\nWilliams and Bowles struck up a friendship when the two became teammates in 1986. Bowles was a rookie out of Temple, signed as an undrafted free agent by the Redskins. Head coach Joe Gibbs had convinced Williams, a first-round pick of the Buccaneers in 1978, to sign with the team after a stint in the USFL.\nThe two players lived 2 miles from each other and clicked.\n“We were like big brother, little brother,” Williams said.\nBowles saw Williams’ charisma and his ability to rally the team around him. He treated rookies and veterans the same way and never showed any signs of arrogance. Bowles also fell in love with Williams’ mother’s sweet potato pie.\nBowles Photo: Joseph E. Amaturo “His family cooked. I made sure I was always there to eat,” Bowles said, letting out a big laugh.\nThe two battled on the practice field. Williams initially backed up Jay Schroeder in Washington and led the scout team in practice. In 1987, he replaced Schroeder and became the first African-American quarterback to win the Super Bowl. But before he made history, he tore up the Redskins’ defense and Williams took notice of the young safety across the line of scrimmage.\n“Doug would embarrass every day when he was over there when Schroeder was the quarterback. We got our butts kicked a lot,” Bowles said. “When he went in at quarterback, the team just rallied behind him.”\n“He was always in the right place and made sure everybody else was lined up,” Williams said. “He was the quarterback of the defense.”\nThat was in Williams’ mind when he got the job at Morehouse. After two or three phone calls, he convinced Bowles to join him.\n“I came in as defensive coordinator. I was the guy. You’ve got to be kidding me,” Bowles said. “That was my first job. It was a lot of teaching and I learned how to deal with people and kids of all different kinds and flavors. You learn a lot coaching in [college].”\nWilliams went 65-39 in his one year at Morehouse and nine years in two stints at Grambling. He is now a personnel executive for the Redskins.\nMost weeks, Williams checks how the Jets have done, hoping his former assistant notched another win. Not this week, though. The two friends exchange text messages or phone calls often, but it might be quiet this week with the Jets facing the Redskins at MetLife Stadium.\nWilliams will be rooting for Washington, of course, but that won’t dull his pride in the man on the other sideline.\n“I think he worked his ass off to get in that position,” Williams said. “In my estimation, he should have been a head coach sooner, but sometimes it’s not about how soon you become it, the fact of the matter is you became it.\n“It’s a good feeling to know that I possibly had a hand in where he is now.”\n new york jets , todd bowles , washington redskins", "external_links": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/bt.jpg", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/bt.jpg?w=167&#038;h=300"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:21:21.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
