He blanked the Bombers 10 days later in Toronto in another pivotal game, before capping his regular season by winning the division clincher in Baltimore.\nIt was Stroman who twice tangoed with Texas Rangers’ ace Cole Hamels in the division series, including that memorable do-or-die Game 5.\n“Yeah, he keeps coming up in those big games for us,” Jays manager John Gibbons said Sunday. “There’s a reason for that. He’s pitched so good since he came back . . . and he stepped up every time he’s gone out for us. He’s the perfect guy for it.”\nThe Jays are turning to Stroman once again in a big spot as he takes the ball in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals. It isn’t yet a must-win for the Jays, but after dropping the first two games on the road, Monday’s homecoming is pretty close.\nIn Major League Baseball history, only the 2004 Boston Red Sox have come back from a three-game deficit.\n“(Monday) is going to be a huge, huge game for us,” said Gibbons, who added that it’s just the kind of game Stroman thrives on. “He’s been known to rise to the occasion in a short career. He’s got many years ahead of him, but what he’s done and the type of games he’s pitched in a short period of time he’s been about perfect. So I would expect him to keep that up.”\nStroman himself says he prefers pitching when the lights are brightest.\n“Yeah, this is fun,” he said Sunday as the Jays worked out at the Rogers Centre.\n“This is what you dream about when you’re a young kid growing up. So I’m happy to be in this position. I want to be the one to have the ball in these games. That’s what all the preparation and all the hard work is . . . to be able to take the ball and go out in pressure situations. And I feed off the energy of the crowd and my teammates and I’m looking forward to being out there.”\nStroman said he’s able to “lock in more” when the stakes are highest.\n“The bigger the crowd, the bigger the moment,” he said. “I feel like I’m able to put myself in a position that I excel better. I don’t know if that’s the nature of how I was raised (but) I feel like pressure situations don’t necessarily faze me. They excite me more. And they make me pitch better and they bring out the best in me.”\nLike he did last series, Stroman is once again lined up against the opposing team’s trade-deadline-acquired ace, with the Royals sending Johnny Cueto to the mound in Game 3. The 29-year-old dreadlocked Dominican had a middling second half with the Royals but came up big when it counted most, throwing eight strong innings and giving up just two hits in the deciding Game 5 of the Royals’ division series against the Houston Astros.\n“They focused on him in the trade deadline as one of their prime targets and they went out and got him for these type of games,” Gibbons said. “He was tremendous his last outing against Houston, he clinched that for them down there.”\nUnlike the Rangers, who had a power-laden offence not unlike the Jays, the small-balling Royals — who had by far the lowest strikeout in the big leagues — can bleed teams to death by stringing together singles.\n“I know it’s going to be a grind,” Stroman said. “It’s going to be a battle out there, and I’ll do everything in my power to keep those runners off the base. That’s the best way to handle that team.”\nThe Jays are once again playing catch-up, but Stroman said they are undaunted by the challenge.\n“I feel this team is a great team to face adversity because of the camaraderie and the confidence in every single guy in the clubhouse,” he said. “We don’t get down. We might get down in the series, but you could never tell if you walked in our clubhouse. We keep an upbeat, very positive nature, and we know we’re capable of getting the job done.”\nMore on thestar.com\nAn in-depth look at Marcus Stroman’s deep arsenal of pitches\nCannock Chase wins Canadian International at Woodbine", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:21:31.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
