The Aggies beat Colorado State 33-18 behind new quarterback Kent Myers, while BYU snapped its two-game losing streak by beating UConn 30-13. \nIn other games last week, Navy defeated Air Force 33-11; Oklahoma State kicked a last-minute field goal to beat Kansas State 36-34; and in the surprise of the day, Iowa knocked off Wisconsin 10-6. \nWith the games in the books, how did we do? Here are the results of Week 5 of KSL's College Football Pick'em. \nKSL.com user J. Barrie (Utah State fan base) correctly picked all five games in his first week of playing KSL Pick'em, ending Week 5 with 204 points out of a possible 250. \nBarrie's best picks were Navy 33, Air Force 17 (46 points) and Utah State 33, Colorado State 24 (44 points). By finishing with the most points in Week 5, Barrie will receive a $30 Wells Fargo Visa gift card. \nConsensus picks went back to average this week with a 4-1 record (prediction, actual): BYU vs. UConn (30-17, 30-13); Oklahoma State vs. Kansas State (33-24, 36-34); Wisconsin vs. Iowa (28-21, 10-6); Utah State vs. Colorado State (22-21, 33-18); and Navy vs. Air Force (25-22, 33-11). \nThe Utah State fan base was also the most accurate in Week 5, earning an average of 24.7 points per game. BYU was second with 23.6 and Utah last with 23.1. Percentage-wise, Aggies correctly picked 67 percent of the games, with BYU picking 65 percent and Utah 64 percent. \nBYU fans were the most optimistic fan base, with 97.6 percent predicting a win over UConn, while 88.2 percent of Aggie fans picked Utah State to beat Colorado State. \nFor those following the KSL Sports group, Ben Dowsett had the best record (5-0), but Ben Schroeder finished with the most points (163). Josh Furlong continues to lead the pack with 688 points. \nHere is the schedule of games for Week 6: No. 18 Michigan vs. No. 13 Northwestern; BYU vs. East Carolina; No. 12 Florida State vs. Miami; No. 5 Utah vs. No. 23 Cal; and Fresno State vs. Utah State. \nIf you haven't signed up yet, what are you waiting for? Each weekly prize will be awarded to the highest point total for that week, so you have the same odds to win as those who participated in weeks 1-5. \nOne new feature that will be added this week is fan optimism, indicating what percentage of each fan base is predicting its team to win.
