The documentary charts 'G-Money's' journey to be granted a fight with David Steffan, who lives with cerebral palsy, which would become the world's first MMA fight between two adaptive athletes.\n125,000 people signed a petition to let Garrett fight.\nGarrett was initially granted a license to fight in his home state of Florida in 2013 before it was revoked shortly afterwards. A petition launched on behalf of Garrett's fight earned 125,000 signatories.\nGarrett's mission is to \"promote MMA within the special needs community\" and it's a fight he's clearly winning.\n[via The Guardian ]", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2015/oct/12/martial-arts-fighter-downs-syndrome-right-fight-video"], "published": "2015-10-13T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:23:51.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
