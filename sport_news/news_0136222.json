Individuals who subscribe to Dish Network or DirecTV will be able to stream the game on their televisions (Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, and/or Roku), computers, or other mobile devices. They will have to login to their cable accounts using the WatchESPN portal (espn3.com or watchespn.com go to the same landing area) and ESPN will verify the account. To find a list of all providers, please go to http://espn.go.com/watchespn/affList?subscriber=videosub . Montgomery suggests that fans test out the options earlier in the week to ensure being able to access prior to the 11 a.m. start on Saturday morning. Once individuals login on Saturday, they will need to scroll down the live event sub-categories to find \"Football\" and then click on the Peru State-William Penn game. If you see a key/lock next to the event, you will need to verify your access to watch the game. If the key/lock is not showing, you have already verified your access and you can watch the game. For more information, contact the Peru State Sports Information Office at 402-872-2380 or email tharshbarger@peru.edu.
