But as soon as he enters his car and the green flag is dropped, Fryer says the anxiety dissipates. The only thing that matters at that point is ramming a car that can reach speeds of 30 miles per hour into the competition. “You’re going out there and you have other cars that are just going to smash into each other, you kind of get a little nervous about that,” Fryer said. “ You have a 3,000-pound car that, if you don’t catch it, is going to put a good hit on you.” Fryer first began his tenure as a demolition derby driver a decade ago. Back then, he, who rode dirt bikes prior to derbying, sat in a little car against the big boys. Though Fryer says he got beat up all over the place, he grew to enjoy it. “You can actually go out there and destroy something and not get in trouble for it. It helps take some aggression out,” Fryer said. “It also helps just to have fun.” The past few years have seen little of Fryer as a demolition derby driver in Sonora however, after he became a derby promoter locally. He has since been more of a traveller, because he can’t participate in shows that he advocates for. “I just travel. I enjoy it. I like to derby,” Fryer said. “I’ve travelled to Napa, Santa Rosa, Calaveras, I’ve even went to Utah. That’s the farthest I’ve travelled.” But all of that is set to change Saturday when Moondog’s Moon Bash Fall Brawl derby comes to the Mother Lode Fairgrounds. The derby, one that Fryer will take part in, was originally scheduled for late September in Plymouth but has been relocated due to the Butte Fire. “I am excited. I get to hit my partners,” Fryer said. “It’s an opportunity to go have fun up here and try to put on a good show for the fans. That’s what they come for — a good show.” Without support from the community however, Fryer said the derby may not have happened. A few weeks ago, Guy Mullins, a friend of Fryer who puts on Moon Bash, mentioned the situation in casual conversation. From that point, Fryer, believing the event still plausible, worked to rent the fairgrounds and began asking for donations. “It has been pretty fast, within three weeks,” Fryer said. “Usually it takes us a little bit longer because we do a preparation. Guy has already had this planned for a year once the last Moon Bash was done.” The derby, which costs the public $10 to enter and is free for those 6 younger, will also double up as a fundraiser. Part of the proceeds will go to the Calaveras Community Fund for people affected by the Butte Fire. “Since it was cancelled over there due to the fire, and it’s a good thing to help the community and be part of it,” Fryer said. “It’s unfortunate about their devastation over there. If we can help out a little bit, so be it. That’s a good thing for the community.” Right now, Fryer said the derby — which costs $100 per car to enter — will feature a ballpark estimate of 30 drivers. The winner of the derby will receive $3,000 and a 1975 Impala with bumpers, while the “most aggressive” driver will earn a 1975 chevy bumper. “People were already building cars for the Moon Bash when it got cancelled or postponed. The guys still had their cars done,” Fryer said. “When Guy puts on a show like that, he gets a lot of drivers. He’s a pretty straight-up promoter.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:16:51.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
