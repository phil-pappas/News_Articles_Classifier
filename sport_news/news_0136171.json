One needs to meet, of course, talk, that is always correct and beneficial,\" Siluanov told reporters on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank semi-annual meeting.\nIt will be the first meeting between the countries' finance ministers since January, when Ukraine announced its plans to restructure its foreign debt.\nRussia has insisted that the debt Kiev owes Moscow is not commercial debt and should not be part of the debt restructuring. Ukraine has said that all of its debt holders should be treated equally.\nSiluanov said the money is already penned in for one of Russia's sovereign wealth funds for next year.\n\"We will immediately use it towards projects,\" Siluanov added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:56:11.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
