I feel like we can get things going here at the end.”\nCunningham entered the season third among a deep pool of Catholic quarterbacks, before emerging in Week 4 after injuries to Cooper Edenfield and Jack Sompayrac. He completed 18 of 27 passes for 260 yards and four touchdowns in the first half on Friday, including three to Rodgers.\nRodgers, a Southern California commitment who caught seven passes for 135 yards, broke free on a hitch-and-go en route to a 60-yard TD reception on Catholic’s second play from scrimmage. Cunningham, who also had an interception, then connected with Chase Kuerschen, who missed Catholic’s first four games this season with a broken foot, on a 7-yard TD pass with 1 minutes, 36 seconds left in the first quarter. He added TD passes of 19 and six yards to Rodgers in the final 3:12 of the half.\nCatholic (4-4, 2-2 Region 2-4A) led 35-6 at the break, pushing its lead to 42-6 on Rodgers’ shifty 55-yard punt return for a touchdown early in the third quarter before giving way to backups.\n“We had a tough stretch earlier this season, played a few state championship teams,” Cunningham said. “But getting Chase (Kuerschen) back helped us, and then Amari, he’s so good.”\nCarter quarterback DeAngelo Brooks accounted for 105 yards despite running from Catholic’s pass rush for much of the night. He threw two interceptions, and two of his three lost fumbles helped set up Hunter Kountz’s 3-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter and Cunningham’s final TD pass to Rodgers.\nThe other staged the Hornets’ only touchdown when teammate Kyler Henderson scooped up the loose ball for a 2-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.\nCarter (3-5, 1-3) can still secure the region’s fourth and final playoff spot by beating Anderson County on Oct. 30.\n“Like I told them, our season’s in front of us,” Carter coach Jeff McMillan said. “We’ve got a rivalry game next Friday, then we’re going to play Anderson County to go to the playoffs, then we’re going to play Greeneville.”\nChris Thomas covers high school sports.
