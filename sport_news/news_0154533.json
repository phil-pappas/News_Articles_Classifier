Then, the first game following that bye the Bengals played at New England the first game after it lost in embarrassing fashion at Kansas City and was basically written off as being finished. \nSome of the players think the same thing. \n\"Last year they put us on ice with it being a bye week right after that 3-0, and the Patriots had the game they had, so they came out heated,\" said defensive end Carlos Dunlap. \"Fortunately we don’t have that bye week and we’re still hot right now.\" \nSaid running back Giovani Bernard: \"The early bye might not have been the best thing. The guys are walking around with a little more swagger, a little more confidence. Confidence is a huge thing for an offense and for the team. It’s all about injuries and what team stays the healthiest, and we’re doing a really good of staying heathy. At the end the day, the teams that stay the healthiest go the farthest.\" \nSaid quarterback Andy Dalton: \"I think when everybody looks at the schedule and you have a Week 4 bye, it's not ideal. We are in a rhythm right now, we are in a good routine, and it's nice that we just get to keep going with it.” \nThe Bengals will try for just the fourth 4-0 start in franchise history on Sunday when they host the Chiefs in Paul Brown Stadium. \nIt won't be an easy game, because the Chiefs have enough talent to make the playoffs, and because it's a classic trap game as it comes after the emotional divisional win at Baltimore and with two-time defending NFC champion Seattle coming up next week in Paul Brown Stadium. \n\"We feel like we've got the right mentality, and so we've got to do whatever it takes to not let anything slip,\" said Dalton. \"I think it’s just the way that we're being coached. I think that our mindset is, we're not satisfied with where we are. It's only three games into the season; we're on our fourth game. That's the attitude you have to have.” \nThe other three times the Bengals began the season 4-0 they made the playoffs each time (1975, 1988 when they went to the Super Bowl and 2005), but just making the playoffs isn't the goal. They've done that the last four years without a 4-0 start. \nBut, it's getting harder and harder to find any weakness on this team when it's this healthy and it will likely gets it best defensive player (Burfict) back after this year's bye week when they face the Steelers in game No. 7 on Nov. 1. \nPerhaps that's why this year's 3-0 has a more optimistic feel to it than last year's 3-0. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
