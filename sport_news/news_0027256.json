The Whitman women totaled 110 points from its scoring five, trailing only meet-winner Whitworth University (30 points) and runner-up Southern Oregon University (97). Whitworth is ranked No. 18 in the latest U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association national poll. On the men’s side, Whitman was only two points behind second-place finisher, and conference foe, University of Puget Sound which ended the day in second place with 117 points. Southern Oregon captured the men’s team title with a 26-point outing, placing all five of its scoring runners within the top 10. Julia Hart paced Whitman’s women over the six-kilometer course, finishing 11th with a time of 22 minutes, 56.7 seconds. The spread between Hart and the team’s fifth scorer, Emily Williams (36th, 24:22.2) was only 85 seconds, leaving head coach Scott Shields pleased. “Our big mover within the team this weekend was Emily,” Shields said. “Her performance not only gives her some great momentum heading into conference, but it also squeezes that gap and helps our team scoring a great deal.” Ziggy Lanman (23:38.0) in 20th place was the next Whitman finisher behind Hart. Close behind Lanman was Lara Ruegg (22nd, 23:51.6) with Allie Donahue (24:07.1) closing the gap between the trio with her 31st-place finish. T.C. Heydon was 11th overall to lead the Whitman men, completing the eight-kilometer layout in 25:51.7. Alex Waheed (27:01.7) book-ended the scoring spots for Whitman with a 47th-place finish. “T.C. has been looking great in practice and is really stepping up in his final season,” Shields commented. “And like with our women, that fifth runner (Alex Waheed) was a big mover within our team ladder.” Heydon out-dueled Matt Wotipka for the Whitman lead Saturday, as Wotipka finished in 15th, 16 seconds behind Heydon. Another duel between teammates was between Caleb Moosman (28th) and Will Mullins (30th). Moosman posted a 26:26.1, clawing out a three-second advantage over Mullins. The Missionaries run in the Northwest Conference Championship meet Saturday, Oct. 31 in Tacoma, Washington. Whitman men lose soccer match to Pacific The Pacific University men scored a late goal to beat Whitman, 2-1, in a Northwest Conference soccer match Saturday.

Whitman took the one-goal advantage into the half. The Boxers tied the game in the 71st minute, and grabbed the lead at the 88th. Whitman hosts Pacific Lutheran University today at 2:30 at the Whitman Athletic Complex. Both Missionaries, Boxers unable to score FOREST GROVE, ORE — The Whitman College women’s soccer team outshot Pacific, 17-6, but their Northwest Conference match finished after two overtimes in a scoreless draw Saturday. The Missionaries (1-8-5, 1-4-5 NWC) had two chances to break the deadlock against the Boxers (3-9-2, 3-5-2), both coming late in the contest. Approaching the end of regulation, Whitman’s Clara Merlino collected a thru ball 40 yards out and raced in alone on Pacific goalkeeper Kailey Hifumi. The netminder came off her line to limit the angle, forcing a Merlino shot that skated inches wide of the left post in the 88th minute. A Pacific foul in the final minute allowed Whitman to push possession into its attacking end shortly before the horn. The pressure resulted in a corner kick, but Alissa Soo’s shot from a Merlino cross was lifted over the crossbar and preserved the tie, sending the contest into extra time. The weekend road trip continues today for the Missionaries with an outing at George Fox University. Whit volleyball suffers weekend setbacks Whitman College grabbed a one-set advantage over Pacific Lutheran, 25-22, only to drop the next three in a row, 25-22, 25-19, and 25-20, and lose the Northwest Conference volleyball match Saturday at home, their second loss over the weekend.
