Rachel Hogan wants her time in the spotlight to raise awareness. \nHogan is executive chef at Pine Shadows Day Break hunting lodge near the small community of Frederick in Brown County. She competed as a contestant on a Food Network show that aired earlier this month. \n\"It was exciting; it was challenging. It was really, it was difficult,\" Hogan said. \nHogan says she had a good time on the show. It was a new experience for her. She didn't come out on top but impressed the judges enough to cook her way into the final. \n\"I had never competed while cooking before so you kind of get to that point it's kind of like, 'oh my gosh I have to either do this or not and there's no redo, there's no trying again. It's just now or never,' so that was pretty exhilarating,\" Hogan said. \nHogan had already been featured in a national magazine. Both bouts of national exposure shared her tie to South Dakota and hunting in the state. At the Aberdeen Convention and Visitors Bureau, tourism officials are anxious for the type of results that can come when the area receives additional exposure. \n\"It just makes our job that much easier,\" Casey Weismantel with the bureau said. \nWeismantel noticed different ways Hogan represented South Dakota while on the Food Network. Hogan says others did, too. \n\"I got some, a little bit, of comments on my boots and flannel that's for sure, but I try and just stay true to what I like to do and what I'm passionate about which is clean eating when you can and incorporating wild game,\" Hogan said. \n\"To have a lodge and Rachel willing to do something like that where they will take that experience and amplify it, bringing those hunters in, it's just great exposure, national exposure that brings it right back to Aberdeen, SD,\" Weismantel said. \nThat's just one part of her life Hogan wanted to bring awareness to when given the platform. \n\"People keep telling me, 'You look fine; you look normal. You look healthy,'\" Hogan said. \"And they don't realize that some days I don't know how I'm going to get out of bed, or I hurt so badly it's hard to walk.\" \nHogan was diagnosed with Lyme disease, which has symptoms including fever, headache and fatigue, according to the CDC. Hogan says her case wasn't diagnosed early, complicating her recovery. \nShe was able to share parts of that story nationally, as well. \n\"Just to raise awareness that what you see on the outside isn't really what's going on and just to bring a little more light to that and that people really need to be aware and get tested and be proactive,\" Hogan said. \nEven though the show recently aired, she was involved in its recording earlier this year so she's been away from the studio for months. Still, as she's busy preparing food for hunters in Brown County, she enjoys thinking back to that opportunity in her life. \n\"It has to be one of the top experiences so far. It was challenging. It was exhilarating and it was kind of unexpected in all the things I learned about myself in the process of just really knowing how deep you can go and how much you can give of yourself and what happens when you really get under pressure, so it was really good,\" Hogan said.
