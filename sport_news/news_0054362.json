Charles Arthur ‘Bud’ Baldridge June 24, 1931 — Sept. 28, 2015 Our hero, Charles Arthur “Bud” Baldridge entered into “High Flight” on Sept. 28, at the age of 84. He passed peacefully in his home with his wife, Wil, at his side, with a view out his living room window of his beloved Twain Harte pine trees. All of his children were with him during his last days as were many other family and friends. Bud was born on June 24, 1931, in Modesto, to Charles and Lucy Baldridge of Ceres. Bud grew up there as an athlete and was active in the Boy Scouts of America, where he achieved Eagle Scout. He graduated from Ceres High School and went on to Modesto Junior College, then Fresno State College where he studied biology. He then began his career as a U.S. Marine Pilot. He served as a flight instructor and aircraft carrier fighter pilot from 1954 until 1966. He flew F4D Skyrays, F9-F Panthers, F-11F Tigers, AD-5 Skyraiders, DC-4 and Convair 580 in Vietnam. He then joined American Airlines in 1966 and retired as DC-10 Captain and Chief Check Pilot in 1991. Bud was a talented taxidermist and model airplane builder. In addition to flying he also loved skiing, oil painting, traveling and kayaking. Bud was an active member of the Twain Harte Rotary Club and served as a volunteer at the Twain Harte Interfaith. He is survived by Wil, his beloved wife of 41 years; his daughter, Lori Bauer, and husband, Joe, of Murphys; his step granddaughter, Sarah; his sons, Brian Baldridge and wife, Lynne, of Chico and Rick Baldridge and wife, Judy, of Campbell; and their two children, Christine and Brent. Bud was very proud of his two grandchildren. Christine recently graduated from the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD as a 1st Lieutenant in the US Marine Corps, and Brent is attending Cal Poly Pomona studying Computer Science. He adored his step-daughter Susan Hobbel and wife, Lindsay Blodgett, of Portland; his beloved sister Audrey Cox, of Sparks, Nevada; his nephew, Dave Ramsey and wife, Donna, and their three children of Paso Robles; and his niece Carol Tisza and husband, Jeff, and daughter of Sparks, Nevada; not to mention his many cousins and dear friends.
