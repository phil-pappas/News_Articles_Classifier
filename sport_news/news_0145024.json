But Saturday, it will be prime time for the Bulldogs.\nAt 2 p.m. at the Fairgrounds, Middle College — which is off to a 4-1 start — will host Triple A Academy from Dallas, the charter school founded by NFL legend Deion Sanders, who also serves as the team's defensive coordinator.\n\"This means everything to our program,\" said Bulldogs coach Kendrick Wade. \"To have a legend like that come to play us ... you just can't put it into words. They're a first-year program, too, but football in Texas is a little different. They've got some great athletes.\"\nWade said the game came about after he received a text from another local coach.\n\"I think it was coach (Jerrell) Starnes (from Fairley),\" he said. \"He said there was a team from Dallas that was looking for a game and we had an open week ... we were just laughing and saying, 'How did we put this together?'\n\"But we'd love to make it an annual event and maybe bring more teams in and get a Dallas-Memphis pipeline going.\"\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n(4) White Station (4-2, 3-0 Region 4-6A) at (1) Whitehaven (5-1, 2-1), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Counting playoffs, these two have met nine times since 2010 with the Tigers winning eight. Most of the contests have been close, though, and this one should be, too. White Station will welcome back Dillon Mitchell, who sat out last week's victory over Bartlett with a slight injury, and trying to slow him will be Whitehaven's goal.\nDANDY DOZEN GAMES\nCraigmont (1-5, 1-0 Region 8-4A) vs. (2) East (4-1, 1-0) at the Fairgrounds, 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: East won four straight after a season-opening loss at Muscle Shoals (Ala.), using a fine running game and a rock-solid defense to great effect. The Chiefs have been shut out in three of their five losses and must find a way to generate some points.\nBriarcrest (4-2, 0-0 Division 2-AA West Region) at (3) CBHS (4-1, 0-0), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: After an easy 63-0 win over Sheffield last week, the Brothers will face a much tougher challenge from the Saints, who are starting to find their groove behind freshman quarterback Jackson Walker.\n(5) Cordova (6-0, 3-0 Region 4-6A) at (11) Arlington (4-2, 1-2), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: The Wolves have climbed into the fifth spot thanks to an offense that gets plays off quickly and the area's top-ranked defense. Potent Arlington will be their toughest test to date.\n(6) MUS (4-2, 0-0 Division 2-AA West) at St. Benedict (2-3, 0-0), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: After back-to-back losses to South Panola and Ridgeway, the Owls will likely be in a sour mood as they open region play against an Eagles team coming off a 28-19 loss to Raleigh-Egypt.\nBolton (1-4, 1-1 Region 8-5A) at (7) Munford (5-0, 2-0), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Bolton's defense will be tested by the Cougars' multi-faceted ground game, which has produced 40 or more points in three of the five victories.\nHorn Lake (2-4, 0-1 MHSAA Region 1-6A) at (8) DeSoto Central (4-2, 0-1), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: The hosts lost a tough one to Columbus-Miss. last week and will be looking to rebound. Alan Lamar continues to lead the area's rushing charts with 1,192 yards (195.3 per game).\n(10) Ridgeway (4-2) at West Monroe-La. (4-0), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: The Roadrunners' defense — which has held three opponents to a touchdown or less — will be tested by one of Louisiana's top programs. Jon Randall Belton, a 6-3, 200-pound quarterback with offers from TCU, Mississippi State and Georgia Tech among others, linebacker Matthew Pihl and 6-4, 350-pound tackle Nordoriyan Boatner are the standouts.\nLausanne (3-1, 1-1 Division 2-A West Region) at (12) Northpoint (6-0, 2-0), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Pick your poison with the Trojans; if athlete Christian Saulsberry doesn't get you, then dual-threat quarterback Nelson Fabrizius will. Lausanne's defense has been very good, though, and will have to rise to the challenge if the Lynx are to end a two-game skid.\nTODAY'S OTHER GAMES\n7 p.m. — Germantown at Bartlett, Marion at Cabot-Ark., Houston at Collierville, Horn Lake at DeSoto Central, First Assembly at ECS, Manassas vs. Fairley at J.P. Freeman, St. George's at Fayette Aca., Fayette-Ware vs. Hamilton at Crump, Westwood at Harding, Central at Kirby, Lake Cormorant at Lewisburg, West Memphis Christian at Marshall Aca., Sheffield at Melrose, Northside at Middleton, Kingsbury at Millington, Center Hill at New Hope, Brighton vs. Overton at Halle, Bolivar Central at Raleigh-Egypt, West Memphis at Searcy-Ark., Olive Branch at South Panola, Hernando at Southaven, Rossville Christian at USJ, Catholic at Zion Christian.\nSATURDAY'S GAME\n2 p.m. — Triple A Academy (Dallas) vs. Middle College at the Fairgrounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:42:56.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
