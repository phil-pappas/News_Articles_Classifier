However, the Indiana Pacers should not have cared about who dressed for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Five futile games into the preseason and the Pacers need to worry more about themselves. \nSo Thursday night, Indiana continued working out the new offensive scheme against the Cavaliers, no matter who was on the floor, and won 107-85 at Quicken Loans Arena. \nMonta Ellis had his most efficient game of the preseason, making 6-of-7 shots for 14 points and center Ian Mahinmi, the only Pacer to match up against a starter, played strong for 16 points (6 of 9) and seven rebounds against Timofey Mozgov. \n“When they have so many guys out it’s easy to play down to the level of competition and I didn’t think we did that,” Pacers coach Frank Vogel said after his team improved to 4-1 in the preseason. “I thought we came in with the mindset to focus on us and build the habits of playing winning basketball.” \nBOX SCORE : Pacers 107, Cavs 85 \nWith the usual starting lineup back in tact – George Hill, Ellis, C.J. Miles, Paul George and Mahinmi – Indiana sprinted the floor and worked quickly in the shot clock to reach 22 points before the 5-minute mark. There were positive signs all around – George forced a turnover on Richard Jefferson and rewarded Mahinmi for running the floor with a bounce pass and his dunk made it 24-8 at the 4:50 mark. Also inside the sets, the Pacers found open looks, Ellis drained all three of his long jumpers as the team made 10-of-19 shots and opened the 28-16 lead after the first quarter. \n“That’s just who he is,” Vogel said of Ellis. “He’s a great scorer. He’s been working his way into game shape throughout training camp. I know come October 28, he’s going to be ready.” \nEven as the second unit rotated into the game, Indiana maintained double-digit leads. Rookies Myles Turner and Joe Young particularly stood out in their respective roles. Turner, who logged his most time of the preseason at 20 minutes, produced 11 points and six rebounds while Young scored 10 points and dished out six assists to contribute to the Pacers’ total of 21. Pacers plot return to greatness on defense \n“We pushed the tempo,” Young said. “Coach said, ‘Don’t run plays, just go up and down and play good defense’ …Everybody did a good job.” \nThe starting unit returned for the third quarter and Vogel did not begin subbing until after the midway point. All together, the Pacers starters tallied 57 points, anchored by George’s 17 points as he played over 26 minutes. \nThrough the four preseason wins, there have been glimpses of individual greatness –George scoring 20 points through the first quarter on Oct. 6 against the Detroit Pistons, then dropping 13 points in the first quarter against the same team a week later. However, the Pacers starters had not sustained a strong offensive showing as long like they did on Thursday. Again, the asterisk must be noted: Cleveland did not have LeBron James, Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love. Even so, Indiana played their random style of basketball the way they should have against the skeleton crew Cavaliers. \n“We’re seeing more benefits from the space, the early attack and the randomness,” Vogel said. “We are playing at a better pace and being more efficient offensively.” \nCall Star reporter Candace Buckner at (317) 444-6121.
