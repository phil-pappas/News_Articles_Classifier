(Travis Bell/SIDELINE CAROLINA) × COLUMBIA — He’s gone from walk-on to backup to starter, to back to the bench. Now Perry Orth is the quarterback interim head coach Shawn Elliott plans to rely on as South Carolina embarks upon the rugged back half of a turbulent season. \nNEXT GAME \nWHO: South Carolina at Texas A&M \nWHEN: Saturday, noon \nWHERE: Kyle Field, College Station, Texas \nTV: SEC Network \nRADIO: WWIK 98.9-FM \nRECORDS: USC 3-4, 1-4 SEC; Texas A&M 5-2, 2-2 Orth has started the past two contests for USC, including a 19-10 victory over Vanderbilt on Oct. 17 which snapped a four-game skid in SEC play. On his Sunday teleconference, Elliott indicated that Orth would again be behind center Saturday when the Gamecocks travel to Texas A&M — and perhaps for longer than that. “I think Perry right now is our solid starter,” Elliott said. “He played really well, we thought, against Vanderbilt. He continues to play well in practice and make good decisions, he continues to have the backing of most of our football team at this moment. The guys kind of believe in him because of how hard he works, and his preparation in practice. So I’d say he’s a pretty solid starter at this point.” Orth, a junior who was put on scholarship by former head coach Steve Spurrier prior to this season, opened the year as backup to Connor Mitch, who started the first two games. Orth played parts of two quarters in the opener against North Carolina after Mitch suffered a bruised hip, and the second half the following week against Kentucky after Mitch was knocked out by a separated shoulder. Orth started the Georgia game as Mitch recovered from injuries that sidelined him for a month. Spurrier started Lorenzo Nunez the following two games against Central Florida and Missouri, until the true freshman suffered a sprained shoulder on the Gamecocks’ final possession against the Tigers. Orth relieved him, and has taken almost every snap since. Orth’s 272 yards against the Commodores — who stunned Missouri on Saturday to snap an 11-game SEC losing streak — represented the best passing effort this season by a USC quarterback. Receiver Pharoh Cooper and tailback Brandon Wilds also compiled season-high yardage totals in the victory. “Now with Nunez coming back, and Connor Mitch getting back into the rotation, we’ll see how it all plays out,” Elliott said. “But right now, I think Perry’s the guy.” Nunez and Mitch both returned to practice in the week leading up to the Vanderbilt game, and were on the dress list against the Commodores. Asked if Nunez could play this weekend at Texas A&M, Elliott said it “certainly is possible.” Mitch, though, will clearly need more time after returning from a hip bruise which became infected, required a blood transfusion, and kept him in the hospital for three days. “I think he’s still got some time to go,” Elliott said. “He has a rusty throwing motion at times, but the more reps (he gets), he’s becoming more confident and he’s stepping in there and doing a lot more. You’re just going to have to play it by ear. He has a pretty serious situation that he went through. He lost a bunch of weight and strength. As he gets further away from that injury, he’s going to become a much better player.” The victory over Vanderbilt was just the second win in the last 10 conference games for South Carolina (3-4, 1-4 SEC), which finishes the season against four Football Bowl Subdivision opponents which have spent time in the AP Top 25, and a Citadel team which is unbeaten in the Southern Conference. The Aggies (5-2, 2-2) fell out of the rankings after back-to-back losses to Alabama and Ole Miss, the latter a 23-3 setback Saturday in Oxford, Miss. USC coaches spent the off week trying to stabilize their recruiting base in the wake of Spurrier’s departure, evaluating personnel, and perhaps adding a few wrinkles for the season’s stretch run. The Gamecocks must win three of their final five games to salvage bowl eligibility and avoid the program’s first losing season since 2003. “It was a week to kind of sit back and kind of evaluate some things,” Elliott said. “You wish you had a full offseason to do that. But for the most part, we got accomplished what was necessary.” Last week Elliott broached the idea of using more multiple-back sets, in an attempt to get more playmakers on the field. As for what those plays might look like, and who might be involved in them — Saturday’s noon game at Kyle Field will tell the tale. “We’ve got another full week of practice, and we’re going to implement some other stuff,” Elliott said. “At this point, I wouldn’t say there’s a permanent personnel change. But there are certain factors we’re looking into in trying to get some of our better players on the field at the same time, which is something we’ve got to do. You’ll see it play out before your eyes.” Get more news delivered to your inbox:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:23:31.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
