Ngata missed the past two games, but he’ll return to being a starter next to Caraun Reid with Andre Fluellen, Jermelle Cudjo and Gabe Wright as backups.\nKitchen was inactive his first game with the Lions after signing on Oct. 8. He played 15 snaps last Sunday, but did not accumulate any statistics.\nWithout Kitchen, the Lions are down to 89 players on the active roster. They could promote a practice squad player Saturday if they need depth at a certain spot for Sunday's game.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com\ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:51:14.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
