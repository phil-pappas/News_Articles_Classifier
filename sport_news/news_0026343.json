His goal is to meet all of them — both Republican and Democrat – before the 2016 election or before any more candidates drop out of the race.\n\"I have a deep love of my country, of the constitution, and I wanted to learn more about the electoral process,\" said Miller about why he embarked on the journey that's already taken him to state fairs, meet-and-greets, town halls, debates, rallies, banquets and fundraisers.\nMiller's grandfather Art Siml, 74, a retired dentist from Wheaton, is the teen's partner on the campaign trail. The duo got started after Miller went in mid-August to the Iowa State Fair where several candidates appeared.\n\"He happened to run into Hillary Clinton and had his picture taken with her,\" Siml said. \"I said, 'If you're really interested, I'll go with you, and we'll see all the candidates.'\"\nThough both grandfather and grandson lean to the conservative side of the political spectrum, they are just as happy to meet a Democrat as a Republican.\n\"The point is, if this is going to be educational, you have to meet all of them,\" Siml said.\nSiml's role is to create the signs that attract the attention of the candidates, press or their handlers. He's made a sign that features red flashing lights and another with a spinning wheel and all the candidates' names.\nTeen on quest to meet all the presidential candidates Carl Miller and Art Siml / Handout Carl Miller, 17, of Downers Grove, spent 10 minutes talking with Mike Huckabee. Carl Miller, 17, of Downers Grove, spent 10 minutes talking with Mike Huckabee. (Carl Miller and Art Siml / Handout) Besides getting attention via blinking signs, Miller said they've learned many other tricks for gaining access to the candidates, including befriending the press, security and campaign staffers, as well as learning where the candidates' cars or limousines are parked.\n\"We've been to areas where the public is generally not allowed,\" Miller said. \"We try to be in the right spot at the right time.\"\nHe met Mike Huckabee after noticing the press area where the candidates gathered after participating in a debate.\n\"We look for where the reporters go,\" Miller said. \"He (Huckabee) was just standing around, and we had about 10 minutes to talk to him.\"\nWhen he chats with candidates, he keeps the conversation focused on their stances on issues. He has been pleased to find how approachable they all have been.\n\"What surprised me the most is how personable they are and how normal they are,\" he said.\nThe pair next plans to head to Milwaukee where they will try to meet contenders at the next Republican primary debate.\nThose he still wants to shake hands with include Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, John Kasich and Rand Paul on the Republican side, and Martin O'Malley, Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb, among the Democrats.\nHe met Scott Walker the day before he dropped out of the race.\n\"He didn't seem like a man who was considering dropping out. But I guess it was about money,\" Miller said.\nAs much as he's enjoyed meeting the candidates, Miller said there's another reason he's undertaken his mission.\n\"I find there's huge apathy among the electorate, a lot of misinformation,\" Miller said. \"I want to do what I can to change that.\"\nHe said friends and classmates support his adventures.\n\"They're always happy to hear my stories and opinions on the issues at stake,\" Miller said.\nThe information he's gathered while meeting the candidates will be put to good use when he votes in his first election next year. He has already endorsed Ted Cruz.\nIn the future, Miller wants to study constitutional law in law school and serve the public. For now, he's enjoying shaking hands with the candidates and spending time with his grandfather.\n\"It's amazing that I've been able to bond with him over this common interest,\" he said. \"Not only do we love each other as family members, but we're able to share our excitement for politics and travel.\"\nSiml agrees.\n\"There's nothing more fun than spending time with my grandson,\" he said.\nThey've traveled 2,000 miles and visited four states in their quest, and they're not yet done. Who knows? Joe Biden might still enter the race.\namannion@tribune.com\n Lincoln Chafee Scott Walker John Kasich", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56255301/turbine/ct-dgr-teen-meets-candidates-tl-1022-20151019", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625499f/turbine/huckabee-jpg-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:35:49.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
