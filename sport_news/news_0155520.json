What is it, Georgia over Alabama by two?What is a big deal Saturday is who's playing quarterback for Alabama against Georgia's defense that's fast off the edge and has enough muscle to contain the Crimson Tide's running game led by Derrick Henry. \nIf you're Georgia defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt, the former Nick Saban assistant, you do whatever is necessary to contain the run and make it all about quarterback Jake Coker. Make him beat you with his arm. Make him make quick decisions. \nCoker made some key plays late in the Ole Miss game and seemed to improve last week against Louisiana-Monroe. \nPruitt, however, can't be all that impressed with what he's seen so far from Coker and the offense. \nULM couldn't been all that impressed either. Alabama produced 303 yards and was 2-of-13 on third downs. Coker? He was 17 of 31 for 158 yards with three touchdowns and one interception. Yes, he had some drops. \nIt so happens ULM and Georgia played in the opener. Comparing scores and stats don't mean a lot, especially when you're Alabama trying to purge a home loss to Ole Miss. So in the whatever it is worth department, Georgia piled up 435 yards and converted 5 of 9 third downs against the Warhawks. \nTo beat No. 8 Georgia, Coker and the offense will need their best game yet. Coker doesn't have to have a SportsCenter performance, but he'll need to be more flawless than flawed. Maybe this is where Cooper Bateman comes to the rescue because he's more a threat to move the Tide with his legs than Coker. \nBut maybe this is Coker's coming out party. Maybe he really is the answer and the Tide will go on to have another College Football Playoff year. \nThis week's picks: \nAlabama vs. Georgia If this is a shootout, and we saw something close to that the last time out in 2012, that's not in Alabama's best interest. Both teams have plenty of weapons, but Georgia has Virginia transfer Greyson Lambert running the offense. In his last two games against South Carolina and Southern, he's completed 33-of-35 passes for 476 yards and five scores without a pick. It has probably helped that defenses are more concerned about stopping running back Nick Chubb than Lambert. But 33 of 35? \nAgainst the Tide, Saban and defensive coordinator Kirby Smart know they have the defense that can handle the run. Alabama's allowed a total of 227 yards through four games. With Georgia's defense and Alabama's defense — don't look for Chubb to break Herschel Walker's record of 12 straight 100-yard games —this game shapes up as low scoring. Something like ... Georgia 23, Alabama 17 \nSan Jose State vs. Auburn Let's don't get too excited that Auburn's defense performed last week like a Will Muschamp defense is supposed to. So Mississippi State was held to 56 yards on the ground, but it really didn't run the ball much since Dak Prescott was having his way dinking the Tigers (2-2) to death with the short game. He completed 29 of 41 passes for 270 yards and two TDs. San Jose State (2-2) is likely to follow a similar script, but the Spartans have a legit runner in Tyler Ervin, who ran for a school record 300 yards in last week's 49-33 victory over Fresno State. Despite being a 20-point underdog, San Jose State should test the Tigers early but when the sun sets it'll go home with a $1.6 million paycheck and its third loss. Auburn 38, San Jose State 23 \nSouth Alabama vs. Troy USA (2-2) was overmatched last week against North Carolina State, suffering a humiliating 63-13 defeat at home. Now the Jaguars open Sun Belt play against in-state rival Troy (1-2), which is coming off an open week. The Trojans are favored by 5 1/2 points and it may have something to do with Troy losing at N.C. State 49-21 earlier in the season. Troy was in the game at the half, trailing 28-14. If USA is going to be a threat to chase a conference title it can't afford to lose to first-year coach Neal Brown's Trojans.
