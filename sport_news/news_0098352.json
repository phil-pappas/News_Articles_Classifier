You know, that whole getting-outscored-46-3 thing. \n“The third quarter has been a nightmare for us,” Coach Jay Gruden said on Sunday , after the Jets pulled away after halftime. \n“Obviously whatever we’re doing here has not been good enough,” Gruden said the next day , when Washington’s coaches held a meeting to discuss the third-quarter issues. \n“It certainly seems like the proper adjustments are not being made,” Mike Jones wrote . “Defenses seem to have figured out Washington’s offense by the third quarter, and once that happens, the coaches don’t appear to have a quality contingency plan.” \n“It’s been addressed. It’s been talked about,” defensive coordinator Joe Barry said later in the week . “I don’t think it’s one of those things that you can just go, ‘Oh, whatever,’ and dig a hole and put your head in the sand.” 3rd quarter via csn pic.twitter.com/0efjSHlSuC \n— Dan Steinberg (@dcsportsbog) October 18, 2015 \nAnd in fairness, there’s plenty that could be arbitrary about this stat. Fumbles lost, for example, is a capricious statistic. Washington’s opponents have also started with the ball in the third quarter in five of six games. \nStill, if you’re like me, you were at least curious how often NFL teams have been outscored as badly as 46-3 in the third quarter through six games. \nThe answer? Not very often. Only 11 previous times in NFL history has a team given up at least 46 points and scored three points or fewer in the third quarter through its first six games, according to Pro Football Reference . The most recent example was the 2006 Texans (outscored 48-0), who went on to finish 6-10. Before that it was the 2004 Dolphins (47-3), who finished 4-12. Before that it was the 1999 49ers (52-3) and the 1998 Bears (61-0), who both also finished 4-12. \nIn fact, of the 11 teams who have given up at least 46 in the third and scored three or fewer in the third through six games, only one has finished with a record better than 6-10: the 1986 Jets. That team started 5-1 — despite a 47-0 third-quarter margin — and finished 10-6. \nAs a group, those 11 teams finished 40-117-1. \nAs far as Redskins history goes, I found just one team that had a rougher go of the third quarter through six weeks. Norv Turner’s 1998 team was outscored 63-13 in the third quarter through its first six games, all losses. But those Redskins rallied to finish 6-10. \nOh, and I’m sure you’ve heard how Joe Gibbs teams were boss in the third quarter after amazing half-time adjustments. His 1982 squad — which would play in the Super Bowl — was outscored 40-9 in the third quarter through its first six games. Dan Steinberg writes about all things D.C. sports at the D.C.
