He crossed in second place and was in line to win around $7,000 in prize money before being disqualified. \nLooking much more energetic than the other runners, Njogu claimed second in a sprint finish inside the Nyayo National Stadium. Race officials say they then realized he’d only joined the field just outside the stadium. \nIn 2013, two athletes were disqualified from the Nairobi marathon after attempting to cheat their way to podium finishes in the women’s race.
