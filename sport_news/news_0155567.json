(Photo: Amanda Stratford/For FLORIDA TODAY) Buy Photo \nMELBOURNE – The young group on Commodore Boulevard is, all of a sudden, in control of its own postseason destiny. \nDespite a team loaded with underclassmen who lost their district opener to powerful Heritage by 39 points, Eau Gallie evened its District 15-6A record in convincing fashion on Thursday, 45-0 over Bayside. \nThe Commodores, now 3-2 overall and 1-1 in district play, have three district games remaining, but they are at least in the conversation. \n“We had a good night,” Eau Gallie coach Tim Powers said. “The passing game was better. The running game was excellent. We put a body on a body, which is what we’ve been preaching all year.” \nA variety of backs benefited, none more than Jalen Shelton. He carried 17 times for 214 yards, scoring on runs of 5, 14 and 60 yards. The first was a dive over the pylon and the last a weaving long one, avoiding tackler after tackler while waiting patiently for every block along the way. Brevard midseason high school football review \nWhat really got the Commodores rolling was the first of two interceptions by Chase Smith. One of a few seniors, he shook off a near-perfect fake by Bayside quarterback Patric McNally, stepped in front of the intended receiver and gathered the ball for a 25-yard sprint to the end zone. \nThat gave Eau Gallie a 14-0 lead midway through the second period. \n“I ran like nothing could ever catch me again,” Smith said. “I got that and it was the greatest feeling in the world.” \nNot for Bayside. The Bears dropped to 0-5 and 0-2 despite a 204-yard passing night by McNally. That included six to John Saint-Vil for 110 yards. On one drive, Saint-Vil made catches of 17 and 19 yards, but the Bears stalled on third and goal from the 4, moving backward with a delay penalty and then turning the ball over on downs. \n“We’ve been there,” Powers said. “We had a great week of practice, and I’m just really proud of our guys, especially the exectution of fundamentals.” \nTyvone Brooks also had a productive night for the home team, carrying 11 times for 71 yards. Ken McKay scored on a 24-yard run in the fourth quarter, followed by a 29-yarder from Mario Harris. \nEau Gallie 45, Bayside 0 \nBayside 0 0 0 0 — 0 \nEau Gallie 7 10 14 14 — 45 \nHOW THEY SCORED \nEG — Jalen Shelton 5 run (Matt Stephens kick), 6:28. \n2nd Quarter \nEG — Chase Smith 25 interception return (Stephens kick), 5:13. \nEG — Stephens 24 FG, 0:00. \n3rd Quarter \nEG — Shelton 14 run (Stephens kick), 10:04. \nEG — Shelton 60 run (Stephens kick), 3:44. \n4th Quarter \nEG — Ken McKay 24 run (Stephens kick), 11:55. \nEG — Mario Harris 29 run (Stephens kick), 6:30. \nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS \nRushing: B — D’Andre Edwards 9-27, Joel Dorjuste 7-23, McNally 5-16, Sheridon Archer 3-(-3); EG — Shelton 17-214, Tyvone Brooks 11-71, McKay 5-44, Matt Wilson 4-41, Harris 1-29, Jamal Wesley 3-18.
