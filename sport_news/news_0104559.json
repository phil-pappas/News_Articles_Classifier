(AP) - Louisiana voters are whittling down the list of candidates vying to follow term-limited Gov. Bobby Jindal into office.\nNine candidates for governor are on the ballot, but the race comes down to four major contenders: Republican Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, Republican Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne, Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards and Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter.\nPolls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday.\nSix other statewide races - including competitive races for lieutenant governor and attorney general - are also on the ballot, along with four constitutional amendments, state legislative seats and local elections.\nIf, as expected in the governor's race, no candidate tops 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters advance to a Nov. 21 runoff.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
