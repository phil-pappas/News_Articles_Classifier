But Dodds almost always was arrogant about Texas and its success and its wallet. Keeping up with the Joneses? Texas was the Joneses, Dodds famously proclaimed. His talk targeted Aggies or Sooners or Cornhuskers or other conferences.\nHe treated his own fan base with a folksy charm, a wink and nod. When football kept winning and winning under Mack Brown and other sports thrived too, it was all good.\nPatterson was arrogant about, well, Patterson. He gave the impression of being the smartest guy in the room, even if that wasn't the case. Patterson might have worn a nifty burnt orange sports coat, but at heart he was a green eyeshade guy.\nDuring a conference call on Tuesday, new Texas President Greg Fenves said many view athletics \"as the front door the university\" and he wanted to make it a \"welcoming front door.\"\nFor many, that front door came equipped with a toll booth, thanks to Patterson.\nYes, Texas probably needed to tighten its belt at the end of Dodds' tenure. With cost of attendance and possible name/image/likeness legal decisions, every athletic department is looking for extra revenue, including Texas.\nUnder Patterson, though, Texas went from the Joneses to the Joads from the Grapes of Wrath .\nEvery dollar was precious and had to be squeezed from fans or athletic budgets. One-hour plane flights for teams became long bus rides.\nIn a lot of ways, his time at Texas resembled the horror stories that emerged from his time running the Portland Trail Blazers.\nAs Patterson departed, Texas selected former Darrell Royal linebacker turned attorney Mike Perrin as its interim AD. By all accounts, he's smart and well-liked and knows the landscape as well as anyone.\nFenves said he was looking forward to working Perrin \"in developing and improving our relationship with Longhorn Nation.\"\nPerrin probably doesn't need any advice, especially from sportswriters. He was an academic standout during his Texas days.\nMaybe the best thing he could be is the anti-Patterson.\nThere's even a handy blueprint.\nMichigan took a gamble on former Domino's executive Dave Brandon as athletic director just as Texas did on Patterson. Brandon spent four years alienating a fan base every bit as proud and devoted as Texas' fan base. The parallels between Brandon and Patterson are striking.\nBrandon was sent packing last season, and Michigan hired a former Bo Schembechler player and former Steelcase executive named Jim Hackett.\nHe managed to land Jim Harbaugh, and Michigan fans started filling up the Big House again.\nEarlier this year, Michigan negotiated a deal with Nike through 2027 that will pay the Wolverines $169 million in equipment and apparel rights.\nTexas is facing similar negotiation right now, with that apparently on Perrin's plate.\nIt's also interesting that Hackett is now in his 11th month with the interim tag.\nFenves declined to provide a timetable for a search for a new AD, which could include anyone from NCAA executive Oliver Luck to Louisville AD Tom Jurich to countless others.\nMaybe Texas fans should get used to Perrin for the near future.\nMore on split of Texas, Steve Patterson\n(Eric Gay/AP)\nCarlton: Steve Patterson provided blueprint of what not to do as Texas athletic director\nTexas AD Steve Patterson out after two years with Longhorns\nSherrington: With AD out, no sure things at Texas for Charlie Strong, others\nPossible Texas AD candidates include Mack Brown and Big 12 competitors\nTom Hicks calls Steve Patterson's firing 'a tragedy,' but his own fault due to 'fatal flaw'\nNational reaction: Ex-Longhorns lobby for Mack Brown to replace Steve Patterson as Texas AD\nTexas president Greg Fenves sends email to Longhorn faithful, pledges support for Charlie Strong, Shaka Smart\nNational Analyst: Steve Patterson was 'too arrogant' for Texas\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/national-analyst-steve-patterson-arrogant-texas", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/tom-hicks-calls-steve-pattersons-firing-tragedy-fault-due-fatal-flaw-inability-communicate", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/carlton-steve-patterson-provided-blueprint-texas-athletic-director", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/possible-candidates-texas-ad-job-include-mack-brown-big-12-competitors", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/sherrington-pattersons-legacy-texas-one-acidic-relationships", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/texas-ad-steve-patterson-fired", "https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/texas-ad-steve-patterson-resigns-mike-perrin-serve-interim", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/longhorn-players-media-react-texas-ad-steve-pattersons-firing"], "published": "2015-09-16T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:37:26.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
