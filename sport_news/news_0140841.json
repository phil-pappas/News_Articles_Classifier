PAUL, Minn. (AP) - A Minnesota lawmaker says his state should regulate the increasingly popular fantasy sports betting industry to prevent scams. \nDemocratic Rep. Joe Atkins of Inver Grove Heights previewed legislation Monday that he says he’ll introduce in 2016. It would recognize daily fantasy sports betting as a lawful activity but require Internet site operators to be licensed in the state. \nAtkins says licensing would subject the firms, such as FanDuel and DraftKings, to background checks and other audits. \nHe says it’s about making sure “fantasy sports betting is conducted fairly and legally” and that people who use such sites don’t get ripped off. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:33:16.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
