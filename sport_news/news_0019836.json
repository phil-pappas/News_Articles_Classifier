When I got cut tonight in the sixth round it was the same thing. I caught a head butt. \n\"I was honestly disappointed in my performance tonight. I got the win and it was a great feeling to get my first one on US soil, but the fans didn't see me at my best, and a big part of that was Montiel's experience. He's a great fighter.\" \nThere was a major upset on the bill as American welterweight Devon Alexander suffered a unanimous points loss against the unheralded Mexican Aaron Martinez. \nThe St Louis fighter, who previously held two titles at super-lightweight, appeared to be outworked by Martinez and will find it hard to rebuild after his third defeat in five fights.
