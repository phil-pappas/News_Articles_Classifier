For the most part, Porter really wasn’t bad. The rest of the secondary was. \nSherrick McManis is a wonderful special teams player who clearly won the nickel cornerback job in training camp, but that has to change after Sunday. \nHe has struggled since the opener against the Packers, and left Detroit with first-degree burns courtesy of Golden Tate and Lance Moore. \nThe other player we have to question going into the bye week is Kyle Fuller. He seemed to be settling down a bit after a really rough start in the Bears’ first three losses, but he took a huge step backward Sunday. \nFuller is willing to come up and stick his nose in on the run and bubble screens, but once he has to play on the backpedal or with his back to the quarterback, he’s toast. More than anything, the Bears’ loss was a wakeup call and reminder to Bears fans about where their beloved really stand in the NFL’s current pecking order. \nThe Bears went into Detroit three-point underdogs and got beat by three points. None of the reasons for Bears fans optimism coming off the two-game winning streak changed. \nCutler was very good again, Alshon Jeffery made a really strong return from his hamstring injury, the young offensive linemen certainly weren’t the reason the Bears lost and Eddie Goldman, Christian Jones and Adrian Amos grew up a little more at Ford Field. \nOn the flip side, the Bears still need another receiver, probably two, and they still have a clear talent deficit on all three levels of the defense, most glaringly at inside linebacker and in the secondary. \nMuch of that won’t change until the offseason, but right now, this team is learning and competing, and after last year, that’s not all bad. \n• Chicago Football editor Hub Arkush can be reached at harkush@chicagofootball.com or on Twitter @Hub_Arkush.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:11:26.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
