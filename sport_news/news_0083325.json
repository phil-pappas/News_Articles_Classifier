In the fresh 12-minute audio clip, Kaushik, while giving a reference of the first leaked audio clip, is heard telling Dalip Sharma, “Maine jhuth nahin bola tha”. In the first leaked audio clip, Kaushik was heard saying that that he was aware about the wrong practices in the internal poll of the party. In the second audio clip, Kaushik is heard saying that instead of circulating the audio clip in the market, it should have been played before senior party leaders in New Delhi. “Jagah jagah audio viral karne se kya fayda hoga aapko, jahan aapko proof chahiye, sirf (party high command) vahin par use kar lo usko”. “Aap upar bade aadhikariyon (senior party officials) ko sunane ke liye kaam le lete. Jo market mein aa gaya na, wo galat ho gaya. Prove karna hai to upar karo ki chunav adhikari (election in charge) ye keh raha hai,” Kaushik is heard saying. He further says, “Jin logo ke pass fayda nahin hai, wahan kyon ja raha hai ye audio clip. Jahan se aapko fayda ho (party high command) wahan karo, mujhe koi takleef nahin hai aur mein aapke sath khada bhi hu. Maine jhuth nahin bola hai. Mein aapke sath huin, par ye jo market mein aaya hai, wo gadbad ho gayi.” In the second audio clip, Dalip Sharma is heard saying that he did not circulate the first clip and people who were with him might have circulated the audio clip. I am not a bonded labourer: Kaushik In the second audio clip, Kaushik is heard saying that he is not a bonded labourer and goes to all party leaders, including former MP Satya Pal Jain and former Union Minister Harmohan Dhawan. “Meri rajneeti ye hoti hai ki sab ke sath ghul mil ke rahuin aur mere se koi naraj na ho. Mein sabke ghar jata huin. Mein koi bandhwa majdoor (bonded labourer) nahin, mein to saare senior leaders ke ghar jaata huin.” Dhawan appears before3-member committee\nFormer Union Minister and senior BJP leader Harmohan Dhawan today appeared before a three-member grievance redressal committee formed by the BJP to look into allegations of favoritism in the internal poll of the party. Sources said Dhawan submitted that senior leaders were not taken into confidence in the internal poll. The committee members heard Dhawan’s complaint and will now decide on it according to the constitution of the party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:07:15.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
