The Wolfpack had not won there since 2001, when Rivers — now a 12-year N.F.L. veteran — was a sophomore.\nMATT JOHNSON Bowling Green’s redshirt senior quarterback passed for five touchdowns for the third consecutive game, and the visiting Falcons shut out Kent State, 48-0.\nJohnson, who also ran for a 4-yard score, was 27 of 40 for 430 yards.\nJohnson, the nation’s passing leader, has thrown for more than 400 yards in six of the Falcons’ eight games and has totaled 3,321 yards and 29 touchdowns.\nQUINTON FLOWERS The South Florida sophomore rushed for 201 yards, a team record for a quarterback, and scored three touchdowns as the Bulls trounced visiting Southern Methodist, 38-14, for their first three-game winning streak in four years.\nWith the leading rusher Marlon Mack sitting out with a hamstring injury, Flowers broke U.S.F.’s single-game rushing record for a quarterback on his first carry of the second half. Matt Grothe ran for 146 yards against Connecticut in 2007, and Flowers nearly matched that with 142 on 13 attempts while building a 17-7 halftime lead.\nLUKE FALK Washington State’s sophomore quarterback threw for 514 yards and hit Gabe Marks on four of his five touchdown passes as the Cougars edged host Arizona, 45-42.\nFalk completed 47 of 62 passes and had the most passing yards ever against the Wildcats, breaking the mark of 511 set by Arizona State’s Ryan Kealy in 1998.\nKARSON ROBERTS Air Force’s senior quarterback rushed for four touchdowns and caught another on a trick play, and the Falcons knocked off Fresno State, 42-14, at the Air Force Academy in Colorado.\nRoberts’s five total touchdowns tied for the second most in team history, one behind the record set by quarterback Dee Dowis in 1989.\nALEX COLLINS Arkansas’s junior running back finished with 105 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, topping rushing 100 yards for the fourth time in five games, to lead the host Razorbacks over Auburn, 54-46, in four overtimes.\nThe game was the longest in the Football Bowl Subdivision this season, according to Stats L.L.C.\nMIKE THOMAS Southern Mississippi’s senior wide receiver topped 100 yards for a team-best fifth straight game, leading the visiting Golden Eagles to a 44-10 victory over Charlotte in the first game involving the programs.\nThomas finished with six catches for 105 yards, including a 69-yarder.\nNews and Notes\nNECK INJURY Baylor finished its win against Iowa State without quarterback Seth Russell, who sustained a fracture in a neck bone on a 4-yard run with about five and a half minutes left in the game. The fracture was revealed on postgame X-rays and a C.T. scan. He will see a specialist next week.\n“He’s a tough guy,” Baylor Coach Art Briles said. “It’s hard to see tough guys hurt.”\nInformation from the Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:49:26.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
