But equestrian is a much smaller circle. Lantz is now the western coach at Fresno State and Southam is the English coach at Southern Methodist. \nIn Lantz’s first two weeks of competition, she has already faced her alma mater. \n“I’m happy that it was at a neutral site instead of in Bishop,” Lantz said. “If it was there, that might have been a little hard. It was hard at first but I think (my riders) are doing great. I love my girls at Fresno.” \nLantz always wanted to work in sports and compliance. Last December, she got the opportunity to come back to Georgia and serve as a volunteer western coach. The decision came just after spring break, when the team was heading into the playoffs. But it was not a choice Lantz had to contemplate for long after hearing that the person who held the position was let go. \n“She literally dropped her whole life, everything she was doing and came back to be there for us,” senior hunt seat rider Leylan Gleeson said. “She didn’t even think about everything that we were going through, she just thought about the goal at hand and that goal was to win SECs and to win nationals. As soon as she came in it was all business. She was so supportive and confident and that made us confident.” \nGeorgia won the Southeastern Conference. \nFast forward six months later and Lantz was met with inviting hugs by her former teammates and riders. \n“As soon as she walked in, it was really exciting because I haven’t seen her in a long time,” senior western rider Heather Schmidt said. “A bunch of us came over and gave her a big hug. It was weird to see her in a different element. It was weird to see her with some other girls, but I’m really excited for her and she did a great job with them.” \nLantz and Southam were a part of the national championship team in 2013. They both shared in the team’s SEC title win this past spring. They both want to implement the winning mind-set they learned at Georgia, at their new programs. Lantz said she sees a difference in her riders already. She works specifically with the western riders, as she was a western rider herself. She knows they know about her rich winning history and she uses it to motivate them. \n“They know that I’m coming in with my eye on where I’ve been and I remind them it feels good to win something like that,” Lantz said. “They will see my ring and it is motivating to them to see that it is completely possible.” \nOne characteristic that resonated with their former teammates and former head coach Meghan Boenig, was their ability to lead and communicate. Gleeson said one thing that stood out to her about Southam before she even enrolled at Georgia was her nurturing spirit. \nSoutham was the host for Gleeson’s incoming class that year. Gleeson was still in high school and was nervous about visiting Georgia, but she said Southam made the recruiting trip pleasurable because of how welcoming she was. She learned on that trip what a great leader Southam could be. \n“I think you need to be relatable and build that respect and that trust,” Southam said. “If you don’t have that relationship as a coach you won’t be as successful with (the riders). What helped me last year was being a captain on the team at Georgia and just knowing that the girls always knew I was there for them. I want to bring that (to SMU).” \nBoenig said what she thought would make them great riders is also what will make them great coaches. \n“Meghan is such an incredible encourager and motivator,” Boenig said. “For McKenzie, it was her willingness to always pick up the slack. It’s more of a visual thing that I can see her doing, like an eye roll. But it’s always because she was picking up the slack \nand saying let’s go and do this.” \nBoenig is a product of the Texas A&M equestrian program. She served as an assistant coach there while she was getting her master’s degree. Lantz and Southam are not her first players to coach for another program. Texas Christian University’s head hunt seat coach Logan Fiorentino is a product of the Georgia program. She graduated from Georgia in 2006 and served as coach for three years for Georgia following her graduation. She had a role in recruiting the hunt seat riders during her time and in bringing in new horses to herd at Georgia. \nThe Georgia equestrian program has expanded its roots farther than the Georgia border. It is an example of how the program has prepared its riders for a life in coaching. Southam traveled all the way from Vancouver to get to her new coaching job in Dallas, Texas. The trip took her four days, but she said she loves equestrian and wanted to continue to exercise that love through coaching. However, the drive was a part of the journey she could have done without. \n“It was a long drive, with complication, but it made it sweeter to get here,” Southam said. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:54:31.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
