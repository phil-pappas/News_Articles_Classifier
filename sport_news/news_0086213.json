Noah Syndergaard turned in one more outstanding outing from the Mets ' collection of outstanding young starters.\nPower, pitching, plus some dazzling defense are falling into place for New York. The Mets breezed past the Chicago Cubs 4-1 Sunday night for a 2-0 lead in a surprisingly one-sided NL Championship Series .\nJake Arrieta , baseball's most dominant pitcher since the All-Star break, had not even settled in when Murphy homered for the fourth straight game, a two-run drive just inside the right-field pole in a three-run first inning.\nMore Information \nNLCS \nMets vs. Cubs \n(N.Y. leads 2-0)\nAll games televised by TBS\nGame 1: New York, 4-2\nGame 2: New York, 4-1\nTuesday: New York (deGrom 14-8) at Chicago (Hendricks 8-7), 8:07 p.m.\nWednesday: at Chicago, 8:07 p.m.\nx-Thursday: at Chicago, 8:07 p.m.\nx-Saturday: at New York, 4:07 or 8:07 p.m.\nx-Sunday: at New York, 8:07 p.m.\nx-if necessary\n\nGiven the quick lead on a chilly night, Syndergaard kept the bats of Chicago's young sluggers on ice with shutout ball into the sixth inning.\nCurtis Granderson robbed Chris Coghlan of a likely home run with a leaping grab at the center-field wall, swiped a pair of bases and scored two runs for the Mets.\nAfter beating Clayton Kershaw , Zack Greinke , Jon Lester and Arrieta, the Mets are two wins from reaching their first World Series since 2000.\nNew York will start NL Rookie of the Year Jacob deGrom when the series resumes Tuesday night at Wrigley Field.\nChicago will go with Kyle Hendricks , part of the less-than-imposing back end of its rotation.\nIf the long-downtrodden Cubs are to reach the World Series for the first time since 1945, they must first force the best-of-seven NLCS back to Citi Field next weekend.\nAfter homering off Kershaw, Greinke and Lester, Murphy added his fifth home run of the postseason, giving him eight RBIs in seven games.\nLong, blond locks flowing out the back of his cap, Syndergaard seems to be taking on a bit of the cockiness of Game 1 winner Matt Harvey . He gained the nickname Thor — the Norse god known for his fierce storms — after he tweeted a photo of himself in costume doing squats on Halloween two years ago.\nAfter the Mets beat the Dodgers in the Division Series, the rookie tweeted, \"Our enemy has been vanquished Odin is pleased\" — a reference to Thor's father.\nAnd ahead of his start against the Cubs, Syndergaard changed the photo atop his Twitter page to a shot featuring lightning striking Chicago's famous Willis Tower.\nHaving made the first relief appearance of his big-league career in Game 5 against the Dodgers, Syndergaard came out throwing 99 mph darts until the sixth, when Dexter Fowler singled and scored on Kris Bryant 's two-out double off the left-field wall.\nJon Niese came in and struck out Anthony Rizzo , squelching Chicago's comeback hopes.\nSyndergaard allowed three hits, struck out nine and walked one. Jeurys Familia's fourth postseason save finished a five-pitcher five-hitter and sent the Cubs to consecutive losses for the first time since they dropped three in a row from Sept. 23-26.\nIt was 45 degrees at game time with an 18 mph northwest wind — some players wore balaclavas that covered their faces, including Mets outfielder Yoenis Cespedes , who played on his 30th birthday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:43:44.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
