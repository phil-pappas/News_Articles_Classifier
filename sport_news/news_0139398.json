In addition, households under $50,000 will pay no income taxes. This results in removing 75 million households from income tax that is 50% of households nationwide (Huffington Post, Dean Baker 2015).\nThe role in government accounting is to collect sufficient funds, taxes, to provide the resources the taxpayers and legislators have voted for to provide necessary services. Government accounting is intended to be transparent and simple rather than relying on risk because the taxpayers’ money is collected under mandate and often necessary for a large portion of the population to survive. It is important to consider the effects of the tax cuts in spending that Trump is promising, what programs will be cut. Many seniors, even today are almost entirely dependent on Social Security and Government Health programs. Many students only have the opportunity to attend a four year college because of Federal Financial Aid.\nRetaining corporate business; jobs, tax revenue, goods and services, and purchases, is an important part of monetary and fiscal policy. It is also important to retain wealth, people with the money to invest start business, support innovation, and fund projects. Venture capitalist and philanthropists are significant investors in the business, technology, medical, and artistic industries. Corporations and the wealthy do have the resources to relocate labor, investments, and themselves.\nTrump promises a 6% increase in economic growth. The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) is considering increasing interest rates to slow the current 2% growth rate we currently maintain (Huffington Post, Dean Baker 2015).George W. Bush and George H. Bush each made similar large cuts during their terms that resulted in much less economic growth than predicted (Washington Post, Dean Baker, 2015). That is why transparency is stressed over risk and profit. The markets are designed for risk when individuals freely agree to the consequences.\nIt is along the same lines of blank check promises that Bernie Sanders is making with free college and healthcare. These promises are not necessary and cause damage to the economy. While Sanders want to kill the economic with socialist overhauls of free market industries, Trump want to defund the programs time has shown people need to manage the swings of the markets, create fairness, and economic equality.\nLet us not forget the ridiculousness of electing a President whose businesses have had to file for bankruptcy four times (The Street.com, Donald Trump, 2015). It is making these kinds of promises and not being able to follow through with profits to investors that resulted in the eight bankruptcies. He guarantees developments that are not feasible then files for bankruptcy when he cannot pay his investors what he has promised, the promises are “too good to be true” promises. The amount a family or individual receives from $,1000 a year in income taxes far outweighs the $83.33 they save by not paying income taxes (Huffington Post, Dean Baker 2015).\nSome of his concerns are the death estate tax repeal for the 3,300 richest people in America (Political Insider, Donald Trump, 2015). Only the largest estates are assessed this tax. It is important to consider that the richest people never pay the full tax rate anyway because of available deductions the government already provides. In the last Presidential election, it was reported that both President Obama and Mitt Romney paid well under 20% in taxes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:06:23.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
