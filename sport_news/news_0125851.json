The result was the same, though. The Bruins fell to 0-2 on the 2015-16 season on Saturday night at TD Garden, where a weak second period doomed them to a 4-2 loss to the Canadiens – their seventh straight failure to beat the hated Habs at home (0-5-2). The B’s, who fell in somewhat similar fashion to Winnipeg in Thursday night’s opener, 6-2, close a three-game homestand on Monday with a matinee against defending Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay, which is 2-0-0. Saturday’s key sequence came in the first half of the second period. The Bruins, still without captain and No. 1 defenseman Zdeno Chara (upper body injury), fell behind 2-0 just 2:15 into the second, when a neutral-zone turnover by the line of Matt Beleskey, David Krejci and David Pastrnak turned into an odd-man rush and a goal for Montreal[s Lars Eller. The B’s looked like they’d halved that lead at 6:30, but Loui Eriksson’s goal was nullified — despite the first coach’s challenge of Claude Julien’s career — because of incidental contact Patrice Bergeron made with goalie Carey Price near the crease. Just 77 seconds later, at 7:47, the Canadiens increased their lead to 3-0 on Eller’s second goal of the period. “I thought otherwise, but we can’t really control that, I guess,” Bergeron said of the disallowed goal. “It’s one of those plays where it would have been nice to get that, but at the same time, there’s other areas of our game that we need to get better at.” Outshot 38-21 (18-7 in the second period), the Bruins were again plagued by turnovers and coverage issues within the defensive zone. They caught a break 5:34 before the end of the second, when Beleskey’s first goal as a Bruin — a pass he intended for Pastrnak that caromed off Montreal’s Nathan Beaulieu and through Price’s pads — brought the B’s within 3-1, but a comeback was virtually impossible because of all the penalties they took. “I don’t know if they were good penalties, or not good penalties,” said Beleskey, who was in the penalty box for an illegal check to the head of Alexei Emelin when Montreal’s David Desharnais opened the scoring on a power play just 1:25 into the game. “Either way, we can’t take that many if you want to win the game.” The Bruins were shorthanded for major segments of the third, including a 3-on-5 disadvantage that included a major penalty assessed to Ryan Spooner, who was ejected for boarding Montreal’s Brian Flynn. Brad Marchand, who left the game late in the third period after a collision with Dale Weise, took a slashing penalty with only 1:05 left in Spooner’s major. Page 2 of 2 - The teams swapped goals in the game’s final minute, with Tomas Plekanec making it 4-1 before Bergeron answered during a power play the B’s were awarded after Torrey Mitchell was assessed a match penalty with 38 seconds to play. As was the case in Thursday’s opener, the Bruins played well in the first period, but a blip on the screen was enough for them to fall behind: Beleskey had only served 11 seconds of his penalty when Desharnais slammed his second whack at an Andre Markov past Tuukka Rask (34 saves) from just off the crease. The goal came on the Bruins’ first shorthanded situation of the season, but they were able to kill two penalties before the period ended to stay within 1-0. The B’s were outshot 10-8, but hit iron behind Price twice: Torey Krug hit a post and Marchand, after knocking P.K. Subban off a puck, hit the crossbar. Not surprisingly, Julien tweaked the lineup in the wake of Thursday’s sloppy loss to the Jets. Defenseman Zach Trotman was scratched in favor of Colin Miller, who played his first NHL game, while center Joonas Kemppainen with a healthy scratch, replaced by veteran winger Max Talbot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:49:31.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
