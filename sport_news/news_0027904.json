The question was in response to Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc River harping on the fact that the Warriors didn't play anybody en route to the title. \nGreen, the Warriors' outspoken forward, said that teams questioning the title is just sour grapes, adding that you don't hear such talk coming from teams like the San Antonio Spurs. \nAnd Curry, the league MVP, issued a mock apology for the Warriors' success: \"I apologize for us being healthy, I apologize for us playing who was in front of us. I apologize for all the accolades we received as a team and individually. I'm very, truly sorry, and we'll rectify that situation this year.\" More coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:07:07.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
