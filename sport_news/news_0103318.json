Flash ahead six weeks and Ontario was in the same situation. \nWhile on a breakaway, Vermilion was whistled for a violation as CJ Koller was given a yellow card with 7.6 seconds. The Warriors allowed sophomore Andrew Male to line up for the kick with the score tied at 2. \n“Seven seconds left, you just got to put the ball in the back of the net,” Male said. “The keeper is on the other side, so put it upper left right over the wall.” \nThat’s exactly what he did Thursday to send Ontario (11-5-1) to the Division II districts at Clyde with a 3-2 sectional championship victory over Vermilion. \n“There was really not time. We didn’t have any options, so just put it in,” Male said of how quickly it had to be set up for him. “You don’t have any time. It’s just the heat of the moment and you’ve got to do it.” \nHis shot lofted over the wall of Sailors in front of him and just over the leaping stab of keeper Ryan Habermehl. Ontario coach Chris McClenathan felt comfortable with the setup, as rushed as it was, because it didn’t give Male time to dwell on the moment. \n“There is nothing going through your mind. You know what you have to do unless you want to play another 15 or 30 minutes,” McClenathan said. \nIt was a tough way to lose for the Sailors, who at 8-10 were much improved over last year’s three-win squad. \n“I told them that’s a championship effort to win this game and keep going in the tournament, but sometimes the ball doesn’t bounce your way. I told them that’s soccer and in the bigger picture that’s life. I told them you’ve got to rebound, and I think that’s what we’ll do,” Vermilion coach Kurt Innes said. \nThe Sailors very easily could have put the match away in the second half when with 15 minutes left, they had three nearly point blank shots on goal but couldn’t score. \n“You’ve got to be composed and relaxed in front of goal,” Innes said. “That’s something we’re going to work on.” \nDuring this skirmish in the Vermilion end, Ontario senior defenseman Clyle Mack saved his team. He positioned himself near sophomore keeper Noah Brokaw to cover him. \n“It ended up coming right up to me and I jumped and headed it out,” Mack said. “(It was) pretty big because it gave us a spark to eventually come down and let Andrew get the last goal.” \nVermilion scored in the first seven on a Zach Kelly breakaway to lead 1-0, but Ontario tied it nine minutes later when Jake Hairston headed in a goal off a corner kick assist by Logan Osborne, his 12th assist of the season and Hairston’s 20th goal. \nEarly in the second half, Ontario scored on a Klimczynski breakaway off an assist by Simeon Talaga. Klimczynski is the program’s all-time leading goal scorer and has 19 on the season. But Vermilion answered 45 seconds later when Demetrius Dunsun headed in a corner kick by Koller. \nOntario will play at 7:15 p.m. Monday at Clyde. \nrmccurdy@gannett.com \n419-521-7241 \nTwitter: @McMotorsport Ontario sophomore Andrew Male kicked the winning goal with 7.6 seconds left to beat Vermilion 3-2 Thursday in a Division II boys soccer sectional champinship match.
