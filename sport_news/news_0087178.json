He also ran seven times for 43 yards, giving Immaculata the victory 28-0. \nLate in the first quarter, after one of many Spartan gritty defensive stops, Phelan found fellow senior wide receiver Sam Costantino for an 18-yard touchdown to put the first points on the board at 6-0. \nOn the ensuing and potential answer of a drive by the Raiders, senior defensive back Riley O’Neil made a leaping interception on their own 2-yard line to swing the momentum back in the Spartans favor. Phelan connected with Costantino down the seam for a 55-yard gain shortly thereafter, and capitalized on the big gain with yet another touchdown to Costantino, this time from five yards out. Phelan ran the two-point conversion in, making the score 14-0. \nCostantino had three catches for 78 yards, with two of those grabs being touchdowns. Senior wide receiver Alex Hofmann also got in on the fun, as he caught seven balls for a whopping 152 receiving yards and two touchdowns. \nPhelan attributed his stellar day to the play of his offensive line. \n“It’s easy to throw when you have such big boys in front of you, they’re all so special, and I could see all of them playing at the next level,” said Phelan. “They’re all smart players, it’s like having five quarterbacks on the field with you.” \nPhelan’s 27-yard passing touchdown to Hofmann with 1:35 left in the second quarter gave the Spartans a 20-0 lead heading into halftime. \nThe Raiders dual-threat quarterback and running back Marquel Taylor tried putting the team on his back for the majority of the game, as he had 20 carries for 74 rushing yards and completed four passes for 41 yards on 10 attempts. Running lanes were tough to come by for Scotch Plains, as Immaculata rotated defensive players constantly, keeping them fresh for future downs. \n“Our defense is outstanding, I think our offense is where it is because of our defense. They work us so hard in practice, and I believe we have some of the most underrated players on defense around,” said Phelan. \nThe Spartan defense caused four total turnovers on the day, constantly putting the ball back in the hands of Phelan and their offense. Junior defensive back Stuart Cundiff had two interceptions on the day, both coming on crucial moments of the game. \nPhelan then sealed the game with a 10-yard passing touchdown to Hofmann with 8:55 left in the fourth quarter to settle the score at 28-0, giving the Spartans a 6-1 record with two games left to play in the regular season. \nThe Spartan quarterback knows how important it is to stay humble and focused the rest of the way. \n“Hopefully we can get the number-one seed for the playoffs, but we have to finish these last two games against Hunterdon Central and Franklin, both teams are great and we can’t take them lightly.” Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1N022K9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:03:28.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
