But the other, he said, was that McGinn had earned it.\n\"He played real well opening weekend at the American League level, had a good (training) camp for us and deserves the opportunity to play,\" Peters said. \"Tenacious, gritty, two-way guy. He plays the game the right way.\"\nMcGinn was called up because of an injury to forward Joakim Nordstrom, who was hurt blocking a shot Saturday in the Canes' home opener against the Wings. Nordstrom played Tuesday against the Florida Panthers, but the injury worsened and he did not practice Wednesday or Thursday, although he did some individual work Thursday at Raleigh Center Ice.\n\"It's an exciting moment for me,\" McGinn said Thursday. \"You dream of this moment growing up playing hockey and for sure it's a special moment for me and my family, just to get this opportunity. I want to come up here and play the best I can and run with it.\"\nAnd being put on Eric Staal's line? McGinn smiled.\n\"That's a pretty cool experience,\" he said. \"Not exactly what I expected. But it's pretty cool, first call-up, first practice, and you're with two high-caliber players like that.\"\nThe other lines Thursday had Victor Rask centering Jeff Skinner and Elias Lindholm, Jordan Staal with Nathan Gerbe and Andrej Nestrasil, and Jay McClement at center with Chris Terry and Brad Malone.\nThe defensive pairings were Ron Hainsey-Justin Faulk, John-Michael Liles-Michal Jordan and Noah Hanifin-Ryan Murphy. Brett Pesce, also called up Wednesday from the Checkers, is the seventh D-man.\nMcGinn, 21, comes from a hockey family. Two older brothers, Jamie and Tye McGinn, have played in the NHL and Jamie McGinn -- now with the Buffalo Sabres -- once said Brock might one day be the best of the three.\nMcGinn, a second-round draft pick by the Canes in 2012, played four seasons for the Guelph Storm of the OHL, scoring 43 goals in 58 regular-season games in 2013-14, then notching six goals and six assists in 12 playoff games as Guelph captured the OHL championship.\nMcGinn made the jump to the AHL last season, closing with 15 goals and 27 points in 73 games for the Checkers. He had two goals last weekend as Charlotte opened the 2015-16 season with a pair of victories over Iowa.\n\"I think I've gained some confidence, figuring out the pro-style game last year in Charlotte,\" McGinn said. \"I think that year down there really helped me out, figuring that out. I think this year I came into (camp) with a better understanding of the game, and I think it's helped out a lot.\"\nMcGinn competed for the Canes in the Traverse City (Mich.) prospects tournament before coming to the team's training camp, breaking his nose after taking being hit by a helmet. He wore a full cage during training camp, laughing Thursday and saying, \"I haven't worn a cage since I was 15 years old.\"\nThat's just six years ago, of course. McGinn is still a young guy and now one getting his chance to play in the NHL.\nMcGinn said his parents and grandparents could be in Detroit for Friday's game. He also said he should be getting calls Thursday night from Jamie and Tye.\n\"I'm sure they'll have a few tips,\" he said, grinning. \"Hopefully I'll just run with it. You just want to come out and help the team the best you can.\"\n(c)2015 The News & Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)\nVisit The News & Observer (Raleigh, N.C.) at www.newsobserver.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738455&h=Hurricanes%27+McGinn+on+debut%3A+%27You+dream+of+this+moment%27", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738455", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738455&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:07:48.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
