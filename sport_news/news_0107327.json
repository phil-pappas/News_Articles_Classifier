Boys shyly considered before moving in, too.\n\"We've had some of the most amazing hugs,\" said Nichols, a board member of the college's foundation.\n\"It helps release that edge of emotion,\" Williams said.\nIt's been 10 days since the campus became the backdrop for Oregon's deadliest shooting ever and one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history.\nOn Monday, as most students return to the Roseburg college for the first time, Nichols and Williams will again be there offering hugs. They'll join more than 40 volunteers working around the clock to ensure every Umpqua student and professor has support. Tissues will be in every classroom. Comfort dogs will be available.\nThe grieving process will be long, mental health workers say. And yet, college Interim President Rita Cavin wrote in a statement, they need to return.\n\"We are all so eager to return to teaching our students,\" Cavin wrote. \"Our students are eager to return to their studies.\"\nThe semester had just started Oct. 1 when a gunman stormed Snyder Hall, killing nine and injuring nine others before fatally shooting himself. School leaders immediately evacuated students. Authorities closed the campus and covered Snyder Hall in black plastic. Classes were canceled.\n\"We heard things that no one should ever have to hear. We saw things that no one should ever have to see,\" Cavin said in the statement. \"Our hearts ache.\"\nThe Umpqua Nine who died in the UCC shooting Lucero Alcaraz , of Roseburg, 19 Quinn Glen Cooper , of Roseburg, 18 Lucas Eibel of Roseburg, 18 Jason Johnson , of Winston, 33 Lawrence Levine , of Glide, 67 Sarena Dawn Moore , of Myrtle Creek, 44 Treven Anspach , of Sutherlin, 20 Rebecka Carnes , of Myrtle Creek, 18 Kim Saltmarsh Dietz , of Roseburg, 59 In the days since, some students left to visit family out of town. Many stayed, pulling in close with friends at vigils and football games with halftime ceremonies honoring those Cavin called \"our Umpqua Nine.\"\nMedia from all over the world descended on the sleepy timber town. President Barack Obama came and went. This weekend, Roseburg and the tiny towns that surrounded it mourned at five memorials.\nAnd now, they must somehow find a path back to normal. Returning will not be easy.\nFor most, the initial grieving process will take about a month, said Ebony Clark, assistant director of Multnomah County's mental health and addiction services. Those who knew the victims or were near Snyder Hall may take longer. Emotions will peak again at anniversaries and when news breaks of other mass casualties.\nThey will also likely peak again Monday, as many return for the first time since buses ferried them away that Thursday morning.\n\"They were terrified to come back to campus. That was one of the hardest things they had to do,\" said Melinda Benton, an associate professor of communication who met with 10 students on the newspaper staff last Tuesday at the campus.\nBenton said her students decided they would focus their energy on taking care of each other.\nProfessors such as Benton should work, too, to take care of themselves, Clark said. In the coming weeks, they will be the ones to lead students, to make them feel safe in a world that isn't.\nClark likened it to airplane emergency demonstrations. When the oxygen masks come out, adults should put on their own before helping children. Teachers should take frequent breaks. They should eat healthy and talk with their loved ones.\nSnyder remains enshrouded and, as of the weekend, yellow crime tape still circled the school. The building sits on the east side of campus, near a bus stop. Visual reminders such as the scene of the tragedy, yellow police tape, media reports and constant conversations of the Oct. 1 events should be taken in with caution, Clark said.\n\"It's important of being mindful of where you're at in terms of your own response,\" Clark said. \"That could mean planning ahead of time your route from your car to class to avoid the building or walk with a buddy.\"\nOn Monday morning, Gov. Kate Brown will walk through the campus with Cavin and Tony Terra, student body president. After, the three will speak to the media and officials will close the campus to reporters.\nVolunteers will direct students to new classroom sites. Though professors decided to keep their Snyder Hall offices, the building will not hold classes this year.\nAs students wind along narrow Umpqua College Road, familiar faces will light their way. Community members plan to line the streets, carrying signs of support.\nAbout 40 volunteers plan to work this week at three mental health service stations, which will be open from 7:30 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. Stations will be at the bus stop, an amphitheater memorial site and at Snyder Hall.\nThe volunteers, a mix of retired teachers, rotary and community members, will be there to talk with students or connect them with counseling services, said Sally Dunn, chairwoman of the college's budget committee.\n\"We are just starting up classes as usual, trying to get everybody back here together,\" Dunn said. \"Everybody in my neck of the woods wants to help. We need everybody to come and reconnect.\"\n-- Tony Hernandez, Casey Parks and Rebecca Woolington", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:38:01.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
