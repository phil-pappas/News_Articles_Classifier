(Yui Mok/PA) \nHis departure would mark the end of a 10-year stint at the BBC – despite public pleas from some of the corporation’s best-known names for Peston to stay. \nIn a spoof on-air appeal, presenter Jonathan Dimbleby described Peston’s potential departure as the “most serious crisis facing the BBC”, while Huw Edwards, Nicholas Parsons and Eddie Mair also took part in the stunt on BBC Radio 4′s PM programme. \nParsons quipped that Peston’s ability to talk with “clarity and smoothness” made him the perfect candidate for a slot on his show Just A Minute.
