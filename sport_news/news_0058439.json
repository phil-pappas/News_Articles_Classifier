That's not to discount 1978, I'm sure it was a great year — but we have to improve right now.\"\nWashington leads the series 58-44-5 and Helfrich, the Oregon native, noted he \"absolutely\" knows the meaning of a rivalry that, after a one-sided stretch of Huskies domination — UW won 12 of 13 against UO from 1974 to 1986 — was stoked into a more competitive series in the mid-1990s.\n\"I think you educate guys on the rivalry as we have so many guys from around the country that don't, Quote: -unQuote: , get it,\" Helfrich said. \"But on a weekly basis we don't talk about the opponent too much in that regard.\"\nHelfrich isn't alone in downplaying any long-simmering angst between the programs, the majority of whose players don't come from the states they play in: Oregon holds an 11-game winning streak in the series, a stretch of success underscored Tuesday by Huskies defensive backs coach Jimmy Lake.\nUW's Lake on Oregon rivalry: \"Hopefully we can make it a rivalry.
