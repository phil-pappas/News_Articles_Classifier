It hurt.\nA lot.\nAdChoices As it should have.\nIan Cole, then with St. Louis, was playing against the Penguins Nov. 23, 2011 at Consol Energy Center when he found himself in position to block a shot.\nSome of the finer points of the seconds that followed — who launched the puck toward him, for example — have been forgotten. Others are seared into Cole’s memory and tattooed into his flesh.\n“I took one right there, off the top of the kneecap,” he said. “It split the whole top of my kneecap open. My kneecap was hanging out. It was so swollen that I couldn’t even move.”\nThat incident prompted Cole, acquired from the Blues late in the 2014-15 season, to change his equipment — he added plastic flaps to the top of his shin guards, to provide a little protection to the area where that puck hit — but not his game.\nHe long has viewed blocking shots as an integral, if occasionally painful, part of his job description, and has been doing it more than almost anyone in the NHL through the early weeks of this season.\nCole enters the Penguins’ game at 7:08 p.m. today against the Dallas Stars at Consol Energy Center with 20 blocked shots in six games, tying him with Calgary’s Kris Russell for second most in the NHL before games Wednesday night.\n“It’s something I’ve always been good at,” Cole said. “I’m certainly not scared of it, I don’t shy away from it. In fact, I like blocking shots.”\nSacrificing one’s body to stop a puck that could be traveling 100 mph requires genuine courage, but Cole is quick to note there’s technique involved, too.\n“I’m not a guy who’s lying down, selling out completely to block shots,” he said.“I like to go down on one knee to block shots, and I tend to put my hand right in front of my face.\n”That way, I know my face is covered, so I can look right at the shot and watch it come right in to me.”\nCole clearly is not a proponent of the dramatic, sliding-block attempt, perhaps because it’s as likely to result in embarrassment as a blocked shot.\n“Time it well, so you’re not selling out and having the guy walk around you and make you look like an idiot,” he said.\nHe realizes that good form isn’t always enough.\nConsider the time Nashville defenseman Shea Weber, whose shot ranks among the NHL’s hardest, unleashed a slap shot that struck a seam on the outside of Cole’s elbow pad. And nothing else.\n“My arm went numb for like, 20 minutes,” he said. “Shea Weber making my arm go numb, that’s not ideal.”\nStill, aside from the protective flaps he added to his shin guards after the kneecap episode, Cole doesn’t rely on altered or unconventional equipment.\nNothing like, say, the shin guards once worn by longtime NHL defenseman Craig Ludwig, who appeared to have a couple of aircraft carriers strapped to his legs.\n“For the most part, I don’t have anything too crazy,” Cole said. “No phone books taped to my legs or anything.\n“If you have good timing with it and stay square to the puck, as far as keeping all of your equipment facing forward, I think it’s pretty safe.”\nMost of the time, anyway.\nDave Molinari: dmolinari@post-gazette.com and Twitter @MolinariPG.\n2015-16 NHL Season\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.post-gazette.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:20:24.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
