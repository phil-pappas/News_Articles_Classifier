They did it despite an elbow hyperextension suffered by junior outside hitter Christa Passaretti and the loss of senior middle blocker Rachel Jacobs, who is out for the season after having knee surgery. \nThe match went a thrilling three games with the Hawks prevailing, 25-16, 27-29, 25-21. \n\"That was a very big win,\" the coach said, reflecting on how well her girls stood in against a bigger school's well-established team. \nRiver Dell's girls are able to pick up the pieces continually because of their overall varsity experience. Seven of them played for last year's State Group 2 championship team. They are off to another spectacular start this season, with an 8-0 record, leading the Patriot Division standings and ranked fifth in The Record Top 20. \nAn equally impressive win came on Sept. 21, against defending Patriot Division champion Pascack Hills, which sent the Golden Hawks to the top of the standings. \n\"They had the lead [14-9],\" Furusawa said of the Cowgirls, \"but we stayed together and fought back and took the first set. And in the second set, we put pressure on Pascack Hills and took them out of their system.\" \nThe result was a 25-22, 25-11 sweep powered by 31 kills, which was an especially sweet win since River Dell had lost twice to the Cowgirls last year. \n\"We had a lot of girls returning this year,\" Furusawa said. \"We did lose a couple of key players, but we filled in well.\" \nThe early season also included a 2-0 win over talented Mahwah on Sept. 17 in another Patriot Division showdown, so it has been an awfully nice start for the Hawks. \nRiver Dell's captains, middle blocker Christine Woods and outside hitter Nicole Kim, are keys to the early-season success. \nWoods, who likely will play basketball at a yet to be determined college, is a three-sport athlete (spring track is her third sport), stands 5-foot-11 and pounds the ball back at opponents. She had six kills against Ridge. \nThe 5-4 Kim is a strong server and defensive player, but she has been dealing with a shoulder injury. She will be playing the libero position, the spot she plays for her club team, at Bryant College next year. She notched 13 digs and three kills against Ridge. \nHandling the libero assignment for River Dell is senior Lauren Messing, who shared the position last year. She is described as \"an excellent, excellent libero,\" by Furusawa. \nMessing continually thwarted Pascack Hills with 14 digs that turned away potential points, and she haunted Ridge with 22. \nPassaretti has shown a high volleyball IQ, the coach said, so she certainly is missed on the outside since she hits her spots so well. Against Ridge, she had eight digs, three aces and three kills. \nThe prime setters are both juniors and share the same first name. Meredith Currlin and Meredith Arancio have been varsity setters since their freshman year. Currlin, who totaled 28 assists against Hills, has the versatility to handle a number of assignments. That was apparent in the Ridge game when she amassed three kills, two digs, an ace and nine assists. Arancio is multi-talented as well, although she has been out with an injury. However, she was healthy for Ridge and led the Hawks with 16 assists and added a pair of digs. \n\"She was sidelined for a couple of weeks, came back, but then went back to the doctor again,\" Furusawa said. \"We're looking to have her back in the near future, hopefully.\" \nGrace Kelly, a junior and a newcomer to the lineup, has been delivering with great force as a right-side hitter. She contributed two kills and a dig versus Ridge. \nThe major find from last year is standout sophomore middle hitter Samantha Grandich, who has thrived in the early going by notching nine kills against Pascack Hills along with 10 kills against Ridge.
