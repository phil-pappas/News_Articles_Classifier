(AP Photo/Chris Szagola) \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Michal Neuvirth stopped 30 shots in his second straight shutout, leading the Philadelphia Flyers to a 3-0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday night. \nSam Gagner, Claude Giroux and Matt Read scored to lead the Flyers to their 12th straight regular-season home victory over Chicago. The Flyers have not lost to the Blackhawks in Philly during the regular season since Nov. 9, 1996. \nThe Blackhawks beat the Flyers in the 2010 Stanley Cup Final and clinched with a Game 6 win in Philly. \nFilling in for Steve Mason, Neuvirth was sensational in his ninth career shutout. Mason missed a second straight game because of unspecified family reasons and there was no word when he would return.
