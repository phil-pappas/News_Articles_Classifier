Despite two fumbles, Cox led the Jayhawks in carries, running the ball 19 times for 45 yards. By Ben Felderstein The Capital-Journal \nLAWRENCE — For the third straight week, KU’s run offense struggled in its 66-7 loss at home against Baylor. The Jayhawks finished the game with 69 rush yards, with an average of 1.8 yards per carry. \nSurprisingly, leading the team in carries was sixth-year senior Taylor Cox, who ran the ball 19 times for 45 yards. KU’s eldest statesman saw his first action of the year against Baylor as he sat out the first four games due to injury. \nCox has spent a lot of his time at KU sidelined due to injury but has always been one of the team’s leaders. Junior tight end Kent Taylor said it was a tremendous boost to have Cox back on the field. \nWhile it may have been a moral victory for Cox, his play on the field was not up to his standards. He averaged 2.4 yards, and coughed the ball up twice, while only losing a fumble once. Cox said that was a “rookie mistake” and it is something he cannot continue to do. \nCox was just happy to be back on the field again doing what he loves. While he may have been unhappy with his performance, he was thrilled to be on the field again. \n“Going into it, I didn’t have any expectations,” Cox said. “I just try to lead by showing my heart and letting my teammates know I’m there for them.” \nCox saw his playing time increase due to a couple of injured backs ahead of him in junior Ke’aun Kinner and senior De’Andre Mann. The two combined for only six carries. \n“Yeah, we’re banged up a little bit there,” coach David Beaty said. “(Kinner) got some issues with that hamstring and that thigh, so he tried. He just couldn’t go. So it gave opportunities to Taylor Cox to get in there.” \nBeaty also got a chance to give true freshman Taylor Martin some carries late. The freshman led KU with 3.4 yards per carry, racking up 24 yards on seven tries. Martin had only four carries in KU’s previous four games. \nBeaty said he planned to get Martin in from the onset. He said Martin was patting him on the back all game, urging Beaty to let him on the field. \nHe also said part of the reason for the Jayhawks’ inability to get a strong run game going was the fact they are always trailing. KU has lost its five games this season by an average of 26.4 points while averaging only 109 yards on the ground. To compare, Baylor is averaging 358 rush yards. \n“We’ve got a pretty good stable of backs there, but you need them in the Big 12,” Beaty said. “If we can get to a point where we’re in manageable situations where you don’t have to throw it down the field a little bit, it will help your running game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:39:18.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
