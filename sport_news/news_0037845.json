Birney Crum Stadium in Allentown. \nEaston (14-5), the fourth seed, had several players either out with an injury or banged up for the first meeting with Emmaus. With a healthy roster, the Red Rovers hoped to give the Green Hornets a tussle or perhaps even pull a major upset this time. \nHowever, Easton fell behind early and, despite playing very well at times, never was able to get untracked. \nRELATED : Rapid recap: Emmaus field hockey team downs Easton in EPC semis \n“I don’t think we could lose 4-0 and say I was happy with the way we played,” Easton coach Casey Eck said, “but I think we definitely improved and got a better effort from our team today. We had opportunities throughout the game, but we couldn’t finish.” \nMuch of the credit goes to a relentless Emmaus defense and the stellar play of Green Hornets senior goalkeeper Paige Garloff , who stopped all six Easton shots. \nThe play that had Eck the most upset was a goal by Emmaus’ Laura Smerker that finished the scoring with 21 seconds left in the game. \n“We held them without a goal the whole second half and then we let them score with less than 25 seconds left,” Eck said. “That’s unacceptable.” \nEmmaus finished the first half strong, too. With Easton trailing just 2-0, junior Kira Koehler scored with just 1:32 on the clock to give the Green Hornets a comfortable 3-0 lead at the break. \nVeteran Emmaus coach Sue Butz-Stavin knows a good team when she sees one, and she was impressed with Easton. \n“Easton plays with a lot of intensity, desire and aggression in going to the ball,” Butz-Stavin said. “They’re quick to the ball. That’s their style of play. In the second half we had trouble scoring because their defense collapsed.” \n“ Hailey Couch (Easton sophomore midfielder) is a tremendous player,” said Emmaus junior midfielder Meredith Sholde r, who has an astounding 53 goals and 35 assists this season. \nEmmaus immediately had Easton on its heels when Koehler scored off a corner to give the Green Hornets a 1-0 edge just 1:25 into the game. \n“That’s definitely not the way we wanted to start,” Eck said. “We talked about the last time we played when it was 6-0 and we wanted to get off to a positive start.” \nDespite the loss, Easton still has plenty to look forward to. The Red Rover host rival Phillipsburg on Saturday then will get ready for next week’s District 11 Class AAA playoffs. \n“Anytime you lose 4-0 it’s never good,” Eck said, “but there were definitely positives today, and we’ll carry them over to districts.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
