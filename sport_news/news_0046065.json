(AP Photo/John Amis) \nLee Humphrey reached out to friends and social media to contact his old friend, Al Horford, as soon as the New Orleans Pelicans and Atlanta Hawks agreed to play their preseason game at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena. \nThe former basketball players on Florida’s national championship teams in 2006 and 2007 haven’t seen each other in years. \nThat will change Friday. \n“It’s going to be good to see him,” Horford said. “It’s always good to see old friends.” \nHumphrey was a guard for the Gators, Horford was a forward. Now an all-star 6-foot-10 forward/center for the Hawks, Horford said he plans to see other classmates before Friday night’s tipoff. \nHe also will play basketball. \nThe game will be the second for both teams during the exhibition season. Both are 1-0 following Atlanta’s 98-96 win against Cleveland on Wednesday. Horford had 15 points and eight rebounds in the victory. \nThe Hawks won 60 games a year ago to earn the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, but they lost to the Cavaliers in the conference finals. Horford said the purpose of preseason is to build a stronger foundation for the next level. \n“It’s a process,” he said. “We want to get better as a team. We learned from last year, but we want to get better as a group. The big thing for us is to make sure we’re playing the right way.” \nFor the Hawks the game is a chance for guards Shelvin Mack (calf) and Kyle Korver (ankle) to work back into playing shape. Both suffered season-ending injuries a year ago and expect to play limited minutes against the Pelicans. \nForward Thabo Sefolosha, who suffered a broken leg while being arrested outside a New York nightclub earlier this year, won’t be with the Hawks. He is in a Manhattan courtroom for his criminal trial. \nWhile the Hawks are fine-tuning, the Pelicans are installing a different up-tempo offense with new coach Alvin Gentry. \nHorford has stayed in contact with other players from the national championship team, particularly forward Corey Brewer (now with Houston) and forward/center Joakim Noah (Chicago). Friday, however, will be a chance to reconnect with Humphrey and other old friends. \n“I do have other Gator friends I want to see,” he said. “We’ll get them together. But after that, we came here for a game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:45:40.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
