He's a special-teams guy, and my dad played special teams,\" Mauti, said, referring to his father, Rich, who also played for the Saints. \"To do this is a dream come true. I'm going to meet (Gleason) as soon as a I can. He's one of my heroes.\" \nGleason, now paralyzed by ALS, but world-renowned for the way he lives with his condition and his efforts to improve the lives of those similarly afflicted, was watching from his motorized, computer-equipped wheel chair. He reacted to Mauti's big play with this Twitter post: \"Hey, Falcons. #NeverPunt.\" New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees (9) works as Atlanta Falcons defensive end Adrian Clayborn (99) pursues during the first half of an NFL football game, Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015, in New Orleans.

Obviously we got to add to that tonight as well.\" \nMark Ingram scored on a pair of short runs for the Saints, and Watson added a fourth-down touchdown catch. \nThe Falcons (5-1) were left to wonder why their punt protection broke down against New Orleans (2-4) when such plays seemed routine in their five previous games.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) \n\"The mistakes were ones we executed before, so why did they come up tonight?\" said first-year Falcons coach Dan Quinn, speaking for the first time after a loss. \"For us to have those come up tonight is hard. I'm going to give a lot of credit to New Orleans, just in terms of the effort they played with. We knew it would be a battle.\" \nSome things we learned from the Saints' surprising triumph over rival Atlanta: \nBETTER BREES: There have been questions about the extent to which a Week 2 throwing shoulder injury to Brees was affecting his performance. His efficiency against the Falcons — 30 of 39 for 312 yards, one TD and no interceptions — should quiet such talk going forward, particularly with the Saints having about 10 days until their next game at Indianapolis. Brees summed up the performance of the Saints' offense as \"validation,\" adding, \"For it all to come together like that, it just gives us a glimpse of what we can be.\" Atlanta Falcons running back Devonta Freeman (24) runs toward the end zone for a touchdown against New Orleans Saints strong safety Kenny Vaccaro (32) during the second half of an NFL football game, Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015, in New Orleans.

JONES: Receiver Julio Jones continues to play through a nagging hamstring injury, and also continues to look a bit diminished relative to the torrid start he had before the injury. Falcons QB Matt Ryan threw to Jones 10 times, but four of those passes fell incomplete. He finished with a respectable six catches for 93 yards, but did not have a touchdown or any truly pivotal plays. \nRUSHING RYAN: The Saints have struggled to mount a pass rush much of this season, but with a multiple-score lead and the crowd behind them in the second half, New Orleans went after Ryan with abandon and sacked him five times. Defensive end Cameron Jordan had three sacks, including a strip and fumble recovery. \nFREEMAN'S FORM: Second-year running back Devonta Freeman once again turned in a solid performance. He gained 100 yards on the ground, highlighted by his 25-yard TD early in the fourth quarter. He also finished with a team-high eight catches for 56 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown. His performance was overshadowed by teammates' mistakes, including a lost fumble by fellow running back Tevin Coleman on the New Orleans 9, then another on a bad snap by James Stone at the New Orleans 17. \nBIG BEN: Tight end Ben Watson, now more active in the passing game since Jimmy Graham was traded away, gained a career-high 127 yards receiving while tying a career-high with 10 catches. The 12th-year veteran also had a touchdown catch on a fourth-and-goal play late in the third quarter. \"Either his number was called or he was just getting open,\" Brees said of Watson. \"He was getting some opportunities and, man, he made the most of it.\" \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:14:43.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
