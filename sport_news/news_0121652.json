Derrick Williams added 14 points and Lou Amundson 12. \nNew York sat three of its projects starters: F Carmelo Anthony, G Jose Calderon and C Robin Lopez. \nCharlotte saw Frank Kaminsky put up 11 points and grab eight rebounds. \nPlaying in just the first half for the Hornets, Al Jefferson and Kemba Walker finished with 12 and 10 points, respectively. Jeremy Lamb added 10 points and seven rebounds. \nThe Hornets’ Jeremy Lin was sidelined with an undisclosed illness. \nAccording to a Daily News report, Lin’s agent had touched base this past summer with the Knicks to see if there was any interest in signing the guard who created Linsanity in New York during the 2011-12 season. \n\"There was no conversation other than them telling me they weren’t interested,\" Lin said before the game. \nLin was signed by the Houston Rockets to a three-year, $25 million offer sheet that the Knicks refused to match when he became a restricted free agate in 2012. Since then he has also played for the Lakers before signing with Charlotte this summer. \nBut the 27-year-old told the Daily News he wouldn’t rule out returning to the Knicks. \n\"I’ve always been open to it, ever since I, you know, I don’t want to say I necessarily left, ever since [they decided they didn’t want to re-sign me],\" Lin said. \"But I’ve always been open to it. But I don’t think they’re as open to it.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:15:47.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
