Here's a look at some of the top Week 6 games. \nNo. 3 Sherwood (5-0, 3-0) at No. 2 West Linn (5-0, 3-0) \nThis could be a preview of the OSAA 6A state championship game. And will likely decide the Three Rivers League champion. \nThe Bowmen and Lions have been equally dominant through the first half of the season. Sherwood has outscored opponents 223-83 this season and West Linn has outscored opponents 230-82. \nLions quarterback and possible state Player of the Year Tim Tawa will look to have another strong performance. Meanwhile, Sherwood will rely on its traditional wing-t offense to control the line of scrimmage and time of possession. \nNo. 9 Sprague (5-0, 5-0) at No. 8 South Salem (5-0, 4-0) \nThis matchup will likely decide the Greater Valley Conference champion. \nBoth teams have already defeated 2014 state semifinalist West Salem. The Saxons will turn to veteran starting quarterback Gabe Matthews, while the Olympians will seek a stellar performance from senior running back Anthony Nunn. \nNo. 6 Clackamas (5-0, 3-0) at No. 7 Oregon City (3-2, 2-1) \nThis game pits the top two challengers to No. 5 Central Catholic for the Mt. Hood Conference title. \nClackamas has been steady, however the Pioneers will be the Cavaliers’ toughest opponent so far this season. A win would likely make its Oct. 23 matchup with the Rams a Mt. Hood Conference championship game. \nOregon City needs a win to keep its hopes of a conference title alive. The Pioneers lost a heartbreaker, 21-20 in overtime , to Central Catholic earlier this season. \nBattle Ground (4-1, 2-1) at No. 1 Camas (5-0, 2-0) \nAfter handing Skyview its only loss of the season last week, Camas can take complete control of the Greater St. Helens League with a win over Battle Ground. \nNo one has been able to stop the Papermakers’ offense, led by senior quarterback Liam Fitzgerald. Camas has scored 35 points or more in each game this season. \nBattle Ground will need to continue its strong offensive play from the past two weeks if it hopes to pull off the upset. The Tigers are averaging 55 points a game during that span. \nSunset (3-2, 2-1) at Beaverton (4-1, 3-0) \nThis game could decide who finishes second behind No. 1 Jesuit in the Metro League. \nThe Beavers appear to be the toughest league test for the Crusaders. A win over the Apollos would cement that status. \nAn Apollos win would put Sunset in the running for a share of the Metro League title, if Jesuit slips up at any point the rest of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:31:10.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
