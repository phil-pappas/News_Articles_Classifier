Five years later, Franklin's Vanderbilt team scored a touchdown in the final minute to beat Ole Miss 27-26 in Oxford.\nNow, the second-year Penn State coach gets a shot at his biggest road win as a head coach. The Nittany Lions visit top-ranked Ohio State, which hopes to intimidate with its black uniforms and \"Dark Night\" themed prime-time game.\nNot that playing in the Horseshoe isn't intimidating enough. Since joining the Big Ten, Penn State is 2-9 at the Ohio Stadium, scoring more than 14 points just once. That was in a 20-14 victory in 2011, when the Buckeyes went 6-6 under interim coach Luke Fickell.\nSince then, Ohio State hasn't lost a regular-season conference game, and head coach Urban Meyer is one victory from the fourth 20-game win streak of his career. Franklin will make his first trip to Columbus aware of what awaits. As ever, though, the coach is thinking positively.\n\"Every day we're getting closer as a team,\" Franklin said. \"We're getting a better understanding of how to work together and how to complement one another, but Saturday will obviously be a real challenge. The way we look at it is as a tremendous opportunity.\"\nSetting aside historical numbers, though, these past four weeks have been rather pedestrian for the Buckeyes. They edged Northern Illinois by 7 points, were taken to the last possession by Indiana and awoke from a 21-21 tie against Maryland (which was poised to fire its coach) to score 28 consecutive points.\nThere's a vulnerability in Ohio State that, if the Lions don't mention it publicly, at least have diagrammed in their preparation this week.\n\"Looking at their film, we understand that we can move the ball on them offensively and we can definitely stick with this team,\" offensive lineman Andrew Nelson said. \"We don't fear anybody.\"\nMeyer respects that approach. Last year, Ohio State arrived at Beaver Stadium having scored at least 50 points in four consecutive games. After a 4-0 start, the Lions had lost back-to-back games to Northwestern and Michigan and weren't expected to hang with the Buckeyes.\nBut after Ohio State took a 17-0 lead, the Lions rallied to tie the game late in the fourth quarter, ultimately falling in double overtime. Players remembered that game as a test of their resiliency. Meyer did too, calling it a turning point of his team's national-championship season.\n\"Up to that point we were good, but I never saw them fight or crawl out from underneath a bad situation,\" Meyer said this week. \"They did that time, and it was incredible. When we did go back and watch it, that was a violent, tough game. A lot of credit to Penn State and our guys. That was a well played, tough football game.\"\nMeyer said he expects another one, particularly from Penn State's defense. But even the Lions' offense has merited some mention.\nMeyer said Penn State's offense is \"coming into its own,\" particularly behind quarterback Christian Hackenberg, whose running skills in last week's game against Indiana impressed Meyer. Further, all-America defensive end Joey Bosa called Hackenberg \"a real pro-style quarterback\" who isn't afraid of pressure.\n\"I remember watching their first game this season [against Temple], and it's nowhere close to how they look now,\" Bosa said. \"They're really coming together and looking like a really good team.\"\nBeyond preparing for the Buckeyes collection of NFL talent, Franklin said the environment is just as imposing. Penn State blared music at practice all week, even researching the songs Ohio State plays at home. \"It's not a whole lot of fun,\" Franklin said.\nPenn State expects that to change Saturday.\n\"It's going to be a fight,\" linebacker Jason Cabinda said. \"It's going to be a battle of the fronts and it's going to be a physical game. I think we're ready and we're really excited about it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:09:27.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
