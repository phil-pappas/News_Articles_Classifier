It’s barely fall – and the Cubs are still playing!\n– BigChris41\nn TB IN 505, you never suggested why Geoff was an idiot in your Speak Up!, which is curious since you obviously have Superior intellect. We can only assume that you think that the LOBOs should be undisputed first place and Cullen Sucks which “both are wrong” to use your words. I am a dedicated LOBO fan but we have a lot of question marks to answer before we take our place at the top of the MW standings. There are 6 different teams in the league this year that could finish anywhere from #1-#6. And anyone who isn’t an uneducated idiot would know this. Which Geoff certainly is NOT.\n– Dale Kennedy AKA Alpha Fan\nn I SAW AFTER recruiting season all the people who took issue with the lack of New Mexico kids being given scholarships with the abundance of talent NM had to offer in the class of 2015. I joined the bandwagon. If NM kids aren’t good enough for Lobo football they’re not good enough for my ticket dollars.\n– Mike Albuquerque\nn TALK ABOUT a return to the Stone Age! As I read the excellent article in the Journal yesterday about the Lobos wanting to return to being “rushing leaders” this year, my first thought was how ridiculous! How many wins have all those rushing yards the past couple of years resulted in? Who cares if you were 4th in the nation in rushing? So many of the outstanding teams these days, both in college and the pros, have prolific and wide open passing attacks. The current approach is going no where and I’m predicting a maximum of 4 or 5 wins at the most this year and next. If you want to improve recruiting and the chances of success, how about a little innovation?\n– JC, SoCal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:49:59.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
