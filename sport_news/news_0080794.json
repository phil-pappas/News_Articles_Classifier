It's never been a problem. \n\"I don't think I can ever be accused of having anything other than the utmost faith in him.\" \nHodgson rued the fact England did not score more, but was pleased to get a win which secures top-seed status for next summer's finals. \n\"We were a bit unlucky that we didn't score a few more goals,\" Hodgson added. \n\"But the most important thing - as I said to the players at half-time - is the victory, which is everything here.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:00:19.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
