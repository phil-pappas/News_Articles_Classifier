Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium.\nHere are five thoughts from the Longhorns 23-9 win against Kansas State.\n1. Running attack\nTexas' rushing attack was key in the Longhorns' win over Kansas State.\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard said the Longhorns wanted to be a run-first offense that brought some nastiness to the team. The trio of Heard, senior running back Johnathan Gray and sophomore running back D'Onta Foreman powered the Texas offense. They combined for a combined 207 rushing yards against Kansas State.\n2. 18 Wheeler\nThe Longhorns continued to utilize their short-down package with junior quarterback Tyrone Swoopes.\nThe package, which has been nicknamed '18 wheeler' because of Swoopes' jersey number, was used multiple times against the Wildcats. Kansas State was able to contain it for the most part as it was able to hit Swoopes' behind the line of scrimmage on a couple plays.\nBut the Longhorns did have some success with it as Swoopes was able to find the endzone twice. Swoopes finished the game with 50 yards and three touchdowns.\n3. Defense sets tone.\nThe Longhorn defense set the tone with a big hit from sophomore safety Jason Hall on Kansas State junior quarterback Joe Hubener during the Wildcat's opening drive that sent him out of the game. Hubener did come back to the game.\nTexas was able to contain the Kansas State rushing attack for the most part until late in the second quarter. The Wildcats were able to drive down the field on their final possession of the first half and capped off the 10-play drive with a seven-yard touchdown pass from Hubener to freshman wide receiver Dominque Heath.\nThe Longhorns were able to hold Kansas State to 243 yards\n4. Offensive struggles\nWhile the Texas offense was able to run the ball well against Kansas State, it also had its fair share of issues.\nHeard and the Longhorns continued to have struggles in the passing game. Heard only passed for 99 yards against the Wildcats.\nTexas also had trouble establishing its hurry up offense as the Kansas State defense was able to stop the Longhorns when they tried to go up-tempo.\n5. Rain\nThe rain kept a lot of fans home and it made its impact in the game.\nThe rain fell and the wind swirled throughout the game. It kept the Longhorns from trying to pass the ball. It also caused a bad snap during an extra-point attempt by the Longhorns. Texas missed the extra-point on its second touchdown.\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:31:31.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
