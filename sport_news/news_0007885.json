By Daily Guide \nThe Manchester derby, a game filled with history and controversy involving two of the most historic teams in England goes all the way back to 1881. \nBoth sides are flying high in the Premier League, with Manchester City top and two points ahead of their fierce rivals. \nBut the all-time record between the two sides will leave United fans buoyant, having won 66 times compared to City’s 45, with both being involved in stalemates on 49 occasions. \nThe first ever match between the enemies took place on November 12 1881, when Newton Heath (formerly United) defeated West Gorton (formerly City) 3-0 despite there being no record of the goalscorers – giving the Red Devils bragging rights. \nNewton Heath is where United started and for six years the club wore a green and gold strip. And it is these colours that were the symbol of a growing resistance to the Glazers' ownership – which helped form FC United of Manchester. \nAnd just like the first ever result, United came away as winners in their last meeting back in April. \nGoals from Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling in-between two Sergio Aguero strikes sealed an emphatic 4-2 win at Old Trafford. \nBut in terms of goals, Manuel Pellegrini’s side are well out in front, netting 66 times compared to United’s 44 during this calendar year. \nAnd coming into the tenth game of the Premier League campaign, City are nine ahead of their rivals on 24 – with Aguero scoring six of them – including his five-star show against Newcastle. \nThe Red Devils, however, are dominant on social media and have nearly three times as many followers on Twitter and a massive 46,810,000 more likes on Facebook. \nBut in terms of their trophy haul, it’s a tail of two generations. \nIn the past five years, the blue side of Manchester has pipped their rivals as the most successful club, winning two Premier League titles, an FA Cup, a League Cup and the Community shield. \nBut if we’re talking about accolades throughout history, then there’s only one winner. \nUnited have clinched a phenomenal 62 trophies from the Champions League (3) to the Premier League (20). \nAnother interesting stat is that Pellegrini’s current squad have far more winners' medals in total between them (158) than United’s current squad (83). \nOn Sunday Wayne Rooney has the chance to extend his lead as the all-time top goalscorer (11) in the derby, with none of the other top five – Joe Hayes (10), Francis Lee (10), Bobby Charlton (9) and Colin Bell (8) – still playing the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:40:58.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
