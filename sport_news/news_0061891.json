Mandatory Credit: Andrew Weber-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Andrew Weber-USA TODAY Sports) Story Highlights CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. — New England Patriots offensive lineman Nate Solder was missing from practice on Wednesday, three days after he left the game against the Dallas Cowboys with an arm injury. \nPatriots spokesman Stacey James declined to comment on Solder, referring reporters to the practice report that said Solder did not practice. A spokesman for Solder’s agent, David Dunn, did not respond to an email seeking comment. \nAs the left tackle, Solder was responsible for protecting quarterback Tom Brady’s blind side. Solder was hurt on Sunday after a play late in the second quarter in which Cowboys defensive tackle Tyrone Crawford went by him for one of five sacks of Brady. \nSolder then left the field holding his right arm, and he was replaced in the second half by Marcus Cannon. \n“Nate is a big part of our team and the group in the locker room,” receiver Julian Edelman told members of the Indianapolis media on a conference call. “He’s a guy that’s a true professional. All that means is that other guys have to step up.” \nThe defending Super Bowl champions are 4-0 heading into Sunday’s game against Indianapolis. Colts defensive lineman Kendell Langford said it did not change his team’s approach. \n“Well, he’s their starting left tackle. So I’m pretty sure it’s a significant loss for them,” he said. “They’ve got Tom Brady and they’ve got him (Solder) trying to protect his blind side. But again, it’s next man up.” \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
