Bobby Puyol converted a 19-yard field goal in the second quarter. \nThe Huskies finally reached the end zone in the third quarter. Quarterback Bryant Shirreffs scored on a 36-yard run for UConn's only lead, 10-7. \nSouth Florida (3-3, 1-1) seized the lead for good on a trick play. D'Ernest Johnson's 29-yard halfback option pass to Rodney Adams handed the Bulls a 14-10 edge with eight minutes left in the third quarter. Adams, a junior wide receiver, finished with three touchdown receptions. \nThe Huskies attempted a comeback. Shirreffs threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Tyraiq Beals with 2:12 left. But they failed to recover an onside kick. \nUConn lost for the fourth time in the last five games. \nShirreffs finished with a team-high 100 yard rushing and threw for 365 yards, completing 28 of 41 passes. He also had an interception.
