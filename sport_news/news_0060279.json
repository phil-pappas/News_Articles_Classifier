Dennis Walsh said Roner of Tahoe City, California died during a skydiving accident at a Squaw Valley, California, golf course.\nWitnesses told deputies Roner was part of a group conducting a skydiving performance for a golf event, when he hit a tree while trying to land and became entangled high above ground, Walsh said.\nAuthorities were not able to remove him from the tree and Roner was pronounced dead at the scene.\nAll the other skydivers landed safely, he said.\nRoner was known for being part of the Nitro Circus, an MTV show centered around freestyle motocross rider Travis Pastrana and his crew of extreme sports athlete friends.\nRoy Tuscany, a friend of Roner, who witnessed the accident said it occurred right before a celebrity golf tournament was about to begin Monday morning.\nTuscany said that he watched as two other parachutists landed safely on the golf course's fairway for the 9th hole but then looked on in horror when Roner slammed hard into a tree about 25-30 feet above the ground.\nHe said Roner's parachute got caught in the tree and Roner dangled there while many on the ground scrambled to find ladders and other means to get to Roner. At one point, several people attempted to stand on one another's shoulder to reach Roner.\n\"There's no protocol for this kind of rescue,'' Tuscany said. \"There's no manual. It was just horrible.''\nTuscany described his friend Roner as \"always positive'' and a \"big supporter'' of the local community.\nHe said Kroner was \"hilarious and was a \"stand-up guy'' who could always be counted on to help out with benefit events like the golf tournament sponsored by the Squaw Valley Institute, a nonprofit organization that describes itself as being \"dedicated to presenting enriching and inspirational programs to the Lake Tahoe region.''\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-29T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:27:48.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
