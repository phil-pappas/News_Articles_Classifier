Brown was hit with a \"lack of coach control\" charge, and other NCAA charges against the program include academic fraud and unethical conduct.\nBrown \"failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance when he did not report violations and was not initially truthful during an interview with NCAA enforcement staff,\" the NCAA found. Brown was also hit with a two-year show-cause order, and he will be required to attend an NCAA Regional Rules seminar during each year of the show-cause period.\nThe NCAA also said SMU will also lose nine scholarships over the next three years and face recruiting restrictions.\nMost of the investigation at SMU centered on whether former assistant coach Ulric Maligi and a former basketball administrator helped former McDonald's All-American Keith Frazier with coursework to become eligible to play at SMU.\nThe school, however, will appeal some of the sanctions:\n—The duration of scholarship losses in men’s basketball and men’s golf and the duration of recruiting restrictions in men’s basketball.\n—The penalty level applied to men’s golf and resulting postseason ban both for the team and for individual competition. (The decision involving men's golf means that Bryson DeChambeau, the reigning NCAA champion, will not be able to defend his title in the NCAA Championship on May 27-June 1 in Eugene, Ore.)\n—The vacating of men’s basketball victories during the 2013-14 season due to the participation of a student deemed ineligible by the Committee.\n\"Our appeal will be based not only on expected mitigating factors, but also on what we believe is a misapplication and/or a misinterpretation of the NCAA’s new penalty structure, as well as some notable procedural errors in this case,\" the school said.\nA statement from Brown was included in the release: “The fact that NCAA violations happened on my watch is something that I regret and take very seriously. I am committed to winning with integrity and we must — and we will — do better. While the decision to not appeal our post-season ban was made in the best interests of the program, I am truly disappointed for our student-athletes who are the most impacted by the penalties and who had nothing to do with the infractions. Our young men need your support now more than ever, and I am confident that the Mustang family will respond.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.smu.edu/news/ncaa"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:06:44.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
