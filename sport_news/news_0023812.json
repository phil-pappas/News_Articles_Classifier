OGC chairman Mundhir al Barwani, vice-chairman Ahmed al Jhdhamy and NBO's head of corporate communications and CSR Leen al Atassi attended the media event, alongside Muscat Hills’ PGA Pro coach Jade Lucas. \nThe programme will be run at the Muscat Hills course and the ladies will undergo training under Jade. The programme is free for all Omani women in the age group of 15-28 years. \nPGA Pro coach Jade Lucas \nThe initiative will get started with an open registration day on October 27 at Muscat Hills, to be held from 5pm-6pm. \nBarwani said, “We are thankful to NBO for coming forward to support our women's programme, which is much needed and highly appreciated. We had plans to do it for a long time, and finally, we have succeeded in this venture. There will be a free golf clinic where the ladies can register on October 27. We hope as many ladies as possible will show up. Also, we are glad to have roped in Jade as the coach for the programme.” \nLeen said, “We are pleased to come forward and support the OGC’s effort in the development of golf in Oman. We have always been the staunchest promoter of the game. As you know, the NBO Classic, the premier European Challenge Tour event, has become the most prestigious event in Oman. We now want to see women golfers come up in Oman.” \nThe OGC and Muscat Hills are expected to reach out to young women from all walks of life in their bid to eventually build a talent pool. \nJade pointed out that much of the training for the 28-odd women already registered for the programme would involve imparting lessons on the basics of the game. “The whole idea is to ensure that they have fun while picking up the basics of the game,” she said. \nThe programme is split into three sections of six weeks each. The first section is called bronze, which is for the beginners. It will be followed by the silver and gold phases. The participants will be pooled into four groups of seven players each.
