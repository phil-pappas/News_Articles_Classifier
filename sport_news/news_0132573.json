They made the most of it. \nFor the first time in the history of the postseason, each starting pitcher logged at least 11 strikeouts. Kershaw was no picnic, striking out 11 in 62/3 innings and allowing four hits and four walks, but he was charged with all three runs. \nKershaw, who entered the game with a 5.12 ERA in 11 playoff appearances, lost his fifth straight playoff start. \nMeanwhile, deGrom dominated his first-ever postseason start. His fastball roared at 98 mph and his sliders nicked the plate at 93. The Dodgers found themselves helpless. Mets Mets vs. Dodgers: Who has the edge in the NLDS? \nJeurys Familia picked up the save, recording the final four outs after Tyler Clippard allowed the Dodgers' only run on Adrian Gonzalez's RBI single with two outs in the eighth. \nWith the victory, the Mets assured themselves of at least a split in Los Angeles, and they did so by remaining true to themselves. \nThe Mets preach a disciplined style of hitting. From the top of the organization on down, players are judged on their ability to swing only at pitches they can hit hard. The philosophy centers on getting starting pitchers to run up their pitch counts, thus making it easier to knock them out of games. \nAt Citi Field, on a bulletin board behind the clubhouse, the Mets display a quote from Zack Greinke, who will start for the Dodgers Saturday night in NLDS Game 2. After a start last season, he called the Mets' lineup one of the toughest he faced all season. \nTerry Collins uses the quote as positive reinforcement. And he harped on this point, both during Thursday's workout and before Friday night's game, reminding his players that discipline might help with the monumental challenge of facing Kershaw.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:41:32.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
