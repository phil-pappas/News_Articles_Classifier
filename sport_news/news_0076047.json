But it turns out only one of them is now expected to be in action when the two teams meet Monday night.\nBryant, who is expected to eventually emerge as a big-play target opposite Antonio Brown in Pittsburgh, finished the preseason with a 138-yard game that included a 39-yard TD reception. Fantasy owners were hoping to consider him for their lineups this week, but word arrived Friday night that Bryant is expected to remain on the reserve/suspended list for another week.\nThe Steelers still are without Ben Roethlisberger, and Bryant never has worked with Michael Vick in a regular-season game. The layoff naturally bought questions about whether or not Bryant is completely ready to get into the flow of the offense, especially as Vick continues to adjust to the challenging playbook.\nIt probably is best to reserve Bryant for at least a week once he returns, until you actually see him deliver some quality production working with Vick. It’s looking like he won’t be back until Week 6.\nIt’s hard to reserve Gates now that he is back, because the tight end position seems like it is sorrier than ever. If you don’t have Rob Gronkowski, Greg Olsen or Travis Kelce, you are likely feeling very uncomfortable about your outlook there. Last year, Gates caught 12 TD passes and showed he still can be a significant fantasy contributor.\nSome fantasy owners may be a bit wary about using a 35-year-old who has yet to step on the field this year. In most cases, though, you have to ignore the age and the layoff and simply go with Gates. The Steelers allow 11.0 fantasy points per game to the tight end, fourth-most in the league.\n\nGates’ presence was sorely missed by fantasy owners and he fills an immediate need.\nMarshawn Lynch (hamstring) is out for Sunday’s matchup with the Bengals. Cincinnati is the only team in the league that has not allowed a rushing TD. Thomas Rawls will start again, but this is not an ideal spot for him, after he was not able to bust loose against Detroit at home last week. Julio Jones (hamstring, toe) is listed as questionable, but he is expected to play against Washington. The Redskins are depleted by injuries in the secondary. This could be a huge week for Jones, who should be widely owned in daily formats. Fantasy owners of Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) likely will be without him for another week, and it’s not looking good for Eddie Royal (hip), either. Jay Cutler (hamstring) is expected to play, and he is a decent streamer against a vulnerable Chiefs pass defense. Marquess Wilson could be a top target for Cutler again and is worth consideration as a bye-week plug. The Bills will be without their two top RBs, LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and Karlos Williams (concussion) against Tennessee. Anthony Dixon likely will start, but he has been dealing with a calf problem and may cede some carries to recently signed ex-Colt Dan “Boom” Herron. Neither RB is a recommended play, but Tyrod Taylor will now have to take on a heavier load as a passer and maybe as a runner, too, and he’s a strong starting option. RB Andre Ellington is expected to return from a knee injury this week. But his workload is uncertain, and Chris Johnson may remain the lead RB for the Cardinals. Keep Ellington reserved.
