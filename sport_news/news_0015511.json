Spartans drop 34-28 heartbreaker to Kapaun By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nWICHITA — Emporia High head coach Corby Milleson trusts his senior quarterback Tanner Taylor wholeheartedly, and Friday’s 34-28 loss to Kapaun didn’t change that one bit. \nWith the Spartans trailing by six with less than four minutes to play, Taylor led his team down the field and faced a second-and-goal situation from three yards out with 24 seconds on the clock. After a Kapaun timeout, the Spartans ran a boot play that ended with Kapaun quarterback/safety Brock Monty intercepting the ball in the end zone to ice the win in both teams’ district opener. \n“He wanted that play, so we let him take it,” Milleson said of Taylor, who finished with 227 yards of total offense. “We had a couple guys open. Unfortunately Brock’s in the middle of the field and just takes one of them away. \n“It’s unfortunate for Tanner, but I’m never going to doubt the kid. I’m never going to doubt what he does for us. It’s one play.” \nThe last play wouldn’t have been possible without Taylor’s presence throughout the game, especially in the final drive. Earlier in the drive, which Emporia started with 3:32 to play, Taylor threaded the needle on a third-and-21 play to Chase Henton for 43 yards. He also completed a 12-yard pass to Austin Hibler a few plays later to put the Spartans inside Kapaun’s 10-yard line. \n“We’re not even close without Tanner Taylor,” Milleson said. “We’re not close without the game Joey Rodriguez had and the game that Bryce Crouch had and a multitude of other kids. I’m very, very proud of our boys.” \nAfter Taylor’s 99 yards rushing, Rodriguez was second for the Spartans with 37 yards on just five carries. Crouch, a junior, played a large role defensively for the Spartans, who limited a potent passing attack from Kapaun to very little. He also reeled in a 28-yard touchdown pass from Taylor to put Emporia up 21-7 in the second quarter. \nWhile the Spartans tamed Kapaun’s passing game, they couldn’t keep up with the combination of speed and power of Alexander Norris on the ground. \nNorris finished with 252 yards rushing on 21 carries that included all five of his team’s scores. The senior running back had three touchdown runs longer than 29 yards and also reeled in three passes for 81 yards. \n“The kid’s a load and he’d fall forward for two or three yards (every time),” Milleson said of Norris. “That’s the difference in the game. It’s not Brock Monty throwing the football by any stretch of the imagination. It’s No. 3 (Norris) running it.” \nMonty finished the game 7 of 16 through the air for 138 yards, including a 70-yard pass to Norris to set up Kapaun’s first score, while also accounting for 90 rushing yards. \n“I lost some sleep over them throwing the post, so I knew early they were going to go to it,” Milleson said. “They got the one post early and didn’t get it again the rest of the night.” \nEmporia’s offense punted its first two possessions and trailed 7-0 when a high punt snap from Kapaun set up the Spartans’ first score: a 2-yard run from Taylor to even the game. \nThe Spartans scored two more unanswered touchdowns for a 21-point swing, getting third down pass breakups from Brent Hastert and Crouch on Kapaun’s next two drives, which allowed Emporia’s offense time to get warmed up. \n“We started off slow, which was expected,” Milleson said. “We knew we’d have some trouble with some of their reads, but we figured it out and had a chance to win it at the end. The ball just didn’t go our way. I’m proud of the kids.” \nDown 21-7, Kapaun answered with a touchdown on its next offensive play, with Norris taking a handoff 65 yards to the house. \nThe Crusaders forced Emporia into a three-and-out on the following drive and drove inside the Spartans’ 10 with under three minutes left in the first half. Emporia, after jumping offsides when Kapaun lined up for a 31-yard field goal on fourth-and-7, held out on the following play when the Crusaders went for it to take a 21-14 lead into halftime. \nKapaun opened up the second half with a 77-yard scoring drive on nine plays, and the Crusaders accrued nearly 175 of their 326 rushing yards in the second half. \n“I think (our) effort was tremendous. Kapaun is a very good football team, and we knew that going in,” Milleson said. “We knew Brock Monty is a heck of a player. We knew that Alexander Norris was a heck of a player.” \nEmporia, now 0-1 in district play, travels back to Wichita next week to take on Wichita Heights, which beat Andover 35-14. \nEmporia (3-4, 0-1) 7 14 0 7 – 28 \nKapaun (5-2, 1-0) 7 7 14 6 – 34 \nKP — Norris 1 run (Williams kick) \nEH — Taylor 2 run (Dobbins kick) \nEH — Taylor 3 run (Dobbins kick) \nEH — Crouch 28 pass from Taylor (Dobbins kick) \nKP — Norris 65 run (Williams kick) \nKP — Norris 4 run (Williams kick no good) \nKP — Norris 29 run (Monty 2-point run) \nEH — Morehead 6 run (Dobbins kick) \nKP — Norris 37 run (Williams kick blocked) \nGAME IN FIGURES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:45:01.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
