The CDA QBs are taking turns tormenting defenses in 2015. (Photo: KREM 2) \nCoeur d'Alene quarterback Austin Lee will tell you two is certainly better than one \n\"We can definitely win a state title this year,\" Lee says. \nThe senior signal caller from experience. \nJust two seasons ago, after an injury to senior starter Gunnar Amos, the Vikings had to rely on a young sophomore QB to lead CDA to a state title. It's Lee's first and only championship thus far. \n\"It was nerve-wracking at first, but the team really built me up and kept my composure and gave me a lot of confidence.\" \nThese days the dynamic is a bit different during his senior season. \n\"We are really young. In 2013 when we won state, I was the youngest there,\" Lee said. \"I'm just doing as much as I can to be a leader and help the team out.\" \nEven if that means sharing time with rising sophomore quarterback Colson Yankoff. \n\"Our job, whether it be quarterback, linebacker, running back is get the kids on the field that can play football,\" Vikings head coach Shawn Amos said. \"Colson is one of those kids and we have to get him on the field.\" \nThe coaches have Lee start the game, and Yankoff take over in the 2nd quarter. At that point, whoever is playing better will continue to see action in the second half. \n\"It was a little heartbreaking at first,\" Lee admitted. \"Everybody gets jealous. I had to put that aside and know what's best for the team.\" \n\"It's been an interesting experience,\" Yankoff said. \"It's obviously my first year playing varsity and I have Austin in front of me and he's been awesome.\" \nAs you can imagine, fans and parents have an opinion on the subject. Austin is the senior quarterback, and he did lead this team to a state championship two seasons ago. \nOn the other hand, Colson is the better collegiate prospect. \nLee was the top-rated quarterback in Idaho last season. \nYankoff stands 6-foot-4, 190 pounds and carries an offer from Texas Tech. \nAnd so the argument goes. \nRegardless of what the parents and fans have to say in the stands, luckily the coaches and players don't worry about that. \n\"We evaluate those guys on a daily basis,\" Amos said. \"We watch hundreds of hours of film on them. \n\"We see them everyday so we are the most qualified to make that judgment. We're a better football team.\" \nA common saying in the sport is 'if you have two quarterbacks, you have no quarterbacks'. But don't tell that to this team. \n\"I don't think that's true at all,\" Yankoff said. \"When one of us is not playing so well, we always have another to come in and get the job done.\" \n\"If you have two average quarterbacks you have no quarterbacks,\" Amos added. \"We have two really good quarterbacks so we have two really good quarterbacks.\" \nIt's a symbiotic relationship. Unlike a lot of high school sophomores, Yankoff has been much more than a fly on the wall. His immense talent is what can get this team back to a state title.\" \n\"He's a stud, as I say every time,\" boasts the elder quarterback. \nAnd for Yankoff, Lee is the perfect leader to follow. \n\"Winning state as a sophomore is ridiculous,\" Yankoff said. \"It's just fantastic that I have a kid like that to look up to and model myself after.\" \nThis time next year Yankoff should be all alone on the depth chart. But for right now two is better than one. And these two will work together to for the greater goal of one. \n\"We're going to win a state title this year,\" Yankoff said. \"That's our expectation from the beginning, and will be all the way through.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.krem.com/1LiU51D TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:55:44.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
