It came with the Devils shorthanded late in the second period. He also assisted on Mike Cammalleri's third period goal, the winning OT goal from Larsson and was outstanding on face-offs.\nJordin Tootoo confronted Steve Downie after the Coyotes winger took a run at Eric Gelinas in the corner. Downie refused to drop his gloves, but Tootoo undoubtedly got his message across.\nThe Coyotes were held without a shot until 1:54 remained in the opening period.\nLOWLIGHTS\nKyle Palmieri had a first period breakaway and missed the net. Palmieri was also in the penalty box when the Coyotes tied the game with a power play goal 47 seconds into the third period.\nThe crowd was small (announced as 12,171), but that was to be expected on a Tuesday night with the Mets and Cubs on TV.\nRELATED: How long did it take these coaches to notch their first NHL win?\nFIGHTS\nTootoo and Kyle Chipchura dropped the gloves after the puck was dropped for the start of the second period. Neither player did much damage in the fight at 0:02.\nHEALTHY SCRATCHES\nDevils: LW Brian Boucher.\nCoyotes: LW John Scott, D Stefan Elliott, LW Matthias Plachta.\nNOTABLE\nPatrik Elias, sidelined with a right knee injury, has been skating on his own more frequently. Coach John Hynes was asked if he's close to practicing with the team for the first time. \"He's not close,\" Hynes said.\nThe Devils' hard hat, presented to Kyle Palmieri after the win over the Rangers, was not given out after any of the team's first four games. It is awarded by the coaching staff, not the players. No one seems to know what happened to the Devils' green jacket, once given out for the same reason as a game's top performer.\nThe Devils' plan to have the team move to the practice dressing room for games, walk past fans and enter the ice from one corner of the Prudential Center rink has seemingly hit a major snag. The NHL has apparently frowned upon allowing the club to put another entrance gate in the boards, which would make two at that end of the ice.
