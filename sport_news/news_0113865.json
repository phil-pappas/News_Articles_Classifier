(AP) — A picturesque town about 60 miles north of Los Angeles was transformed into the fictional hometown of Marty McFly from the \"Back to the Future\" franchise as part of a five-day fan event celebrating \"Back to the Future\" Day.\nThe occasion marks the date — Oct. 21, 2015 — that the movie characters journeyed from 1985 to 2015 in the trilogy's second installment in 1989.\nThe downtown streets of Fillmore, California, were blocked off from traffic. Fans dressed as characters from the beloved sci-fi film series and participated in hoverboard and DeLorean rides.\nThe event's organizers selected Fillmore for Thursday's festivities because of its proximity to Los Angeles and resemblance to the Hill Valley town square set on the Universal Studios lot.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:07:19.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
