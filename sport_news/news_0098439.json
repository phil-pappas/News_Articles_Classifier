He is expected to undergo more operations on his foot, which is at risk for further infection. \nAccording to Rapoport, citing a source with knowledge of Fells' condition, doctors also fear that the MRSA has infected his bone and could travel into his blood. \nGiants spokesman Pat Hanlon told ESPN.com that it \"is a serious situation that has been taken seriously from the beginning. We're all fighting for Daniel.\" \nFells, 32, was placed on season-ending injured reserve Monday. \nAfter Fells' diagnosis, the Giants took precautions to prevent further spread of MRSA by scrubbing their locker room, training room and meeting rooms, a source told ESPN.
