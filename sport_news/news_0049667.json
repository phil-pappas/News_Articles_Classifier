Infante died in Florida at age 75. Infante's wife Stephanie told The Associated Press that he died Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, in St. Augustine after a lengthy illness. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File) \nLindy Infante, who coached the Jacksonville Bulls during their two-year USFL tenure (1984-85) and lived in Crescent Beach after retiring from NFL coaching, passed away on Thursday at age 75. \nInfante had been in poor health and died of pneumonia at a St. Augustine hospice. \nInfante, who played halfback at the University of Florida (1960-62) and later coached there under Ray Graves and Doug Dickey, also served as head coach for the Green Bay Packers (1988-91) and the Indianapolis Colts (1996-97). He compiled an overall record of 36-60, having his most successful year with the Packers when he went 10-6 in 1989 and was named NFL Coach of the Year. \n“Lindy was a good person. Everybody that knew him liked him,” said South Carolina football coach Steve Spurrier, who played at UF after Infante graduated and also owns a home in Crescent Beach. “He was a very good coach in his day. He got out of coaching early, dabbled in some real estate in Crescent Beach. \n“Lindy loved life,’’ Spurrier told the Times-Union. “He had all the toys at the beach. He had that [paraglider], flying it up and down the beach with the parachute behind it. He thoroughly enjoyed using it.” \nInfante was hired by the USFL expansion Bulls after a two-year stint as offensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals. During Infante’s time in Jacksonville, the Bulls led the league in attendance, averaging over 46,000 fans, but couldn’t duplicate that success on the field. \nIn 1984, the Bulls went 6-12, then finished 9-9 and one game out of the playoffs the following year before the USFL folded. \n“Lindy was a great guy, very upfront, sincere and smart,” said former Bulls PR director Glenn Greenspan, who now serves in the same capacity for Tiger Woods. “He treated everybody with respect. I don’t remember any situation where he wasn’t nice or cooperative.” \nIn many ways, Infante was a victim of bad timing in his NFL coaching career. After the Packers finished 4-12 in his final season, the team overhauled its front office, and the following year acquired quarterback Brett Favre. \nIn 1997, the Colts finished 3-13 and Infante was out of a job after two seasons with a 12-20 record. The following offseason, Indianapolis drafted quarterback Peyton Manning. \nDickey, the former UF coach (1970-78) who had Infante on his staff as running backs coach in his first two years, said: “Lindy had a really great mind about the game.’’ \n“He was an excellent contributor to what happened on the field and in study rooms. He was excellent at analyzing the game and creating the right matchups. Obviously, his ability to manage the game stuck out in the pros.” \nInfante is survived by his wife of 50 years, Stephanie, two sons and six grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are pending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:45:58.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
