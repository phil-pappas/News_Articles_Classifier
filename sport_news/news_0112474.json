As it stands now, Ogunyemi must sit out a season because he transferred to Boston University this summer before changing his mind and returning to Siena.\nOgunyemi, who is able to practice, took part in Siena's 40-minute intrasquad scrimmage Tuesday. He was playing with the green team (reserves) against the white team (starters).\n\"I'm still waiting just like everybody else,\" Ogunyemi said before practice. \"I just want to know pretty much whether or not I'm going to be able to help this year. I mean, I plan on helping this year, anyway, in practice, but I just want to know whether I'll be able to play.\"\nSiena compliance coordinator Melissa Peach sent Ogunyemi an email last week letting him know that once she hears from the NCAA, he'll be the first to know, Ogunyemi said.\nSiena is appealing on Ogunyemi's behalf on the grounds that personal hardship led him to return to Loudonville. His cousin, Tyreek Prince , was fatally shot this past May 31 in Troy. That followed the death of Ogunyemi's mother, Thomasina Schultz , in August 2013.\nOgunyemi said Boston University coach Joe Jones sent a letter to the NCAA on his behalf.\n\"I appreciate it a lot,\" Ogunyemi said. \" Coach Jones knew when I was out there, and the stuff I was going through with my family, I was struggling. He knew I wasn't just out there to spend a summer there. He just knew that I was going through a lot and the letter would help me, because he wants to see me do well.\"\nSiena coach Jimmy Patsos said he's optimistic Ogunyemi will win his appeal, because the NCAA asked for more documentation recently.\n\"They came back and said, 'We need more things,'\" Patsos said. \"They didn't say, 'No.'\"\nOgunyemi averaged 9.3 points and 4.8 rebounds last season. His return would boost the depth of a frontcourt that returns junior forward Brett Bisping and senior center Imoh Silas from injury; the Saints also add freshman center Evan Fisher . Silas sat out last week with a strained back but has returned to action.\n\"(Ogunyemi) is huge,\" Patsos added. \"Big difference if we get him. We'll survive without him, but I'd much rather have him.\"\nmsingelais@timesunion.com • 518-454-5509 • @MarkSingelais", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823449/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823451/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823449/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823450/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823448/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823450/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823449/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823447/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823450/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823448/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823451/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823447/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823451/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/12/8823448/3/628x471.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:35:45.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
