Comment   By Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 9:06 PM By Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 9:06 PM ST. JAMES, Mo. To say the least, the St. James High School football team has had better homecoming celebrations than the one it endured Friday night. The host Tigers burned themselves throughout a disastrous first half, committing four turnovers before intermission as the Union Wildcats did all their scoring over the first two quarters and went on to cost to a 42-12 Four Rivers Conference victory in the STJ Homecoming Game. St. James falls to 2-6 overall and 1-4 in the conference while Union improves to 2-6 and 2-3. “It was a frustrating beginning of the game because we were doing some things right - we had 220 yards of total offense in the first half,” said St. James head coach Greg Harlan. “But we had some self-inflicted mistakes; turnovers that gave them short fields and two defensive scores. “We never gave ourselves a chance to be competitive.” Union opened the game with a sustained offensive drive, capped by a 11-yard TD run by sophomore wideout Anthony Karim at the 10:33 mark of the first period. Then the Tigers got in a giving mood. Wildcat senior linebacker Nick Kretzler scooped up a Tiger fumble and returned it 88 yards for a touchdown. Late in the first period Union got another short-field opportunity, recovering a St. James fumble at the Tiger 15 yardline, and senior Danny Arnold ended up scoring on a five-yard TD run. To open the second period the Tigers got on the scoreboard, as sophomore quarterback Ryan Harlan hit sophomore running back Gunnar Seams with a five-yard TD pass at the 11:01 mark. St. James was driving again on its next possession, completing a screen pass only to fumble again. And the Wildcats recovered again, which led to a four-yard touchdown run by junior Deric Purnell. The next Union TD came off a Tiger interception, as sophomore linebacker Jacob Fleming picked off a Harlan pass and returned it 45 yards for the score. The final Wildcat score came late in the second quarter on a nine-yard pass from senior QB Jerod Mattingly to senior Tyler Pace. When the smoke cleared Union had a 42-6 halftime bulge and started the second half with a running clock. St. James’ final score came in the fourth period on a 14-yard pass from Harlan to junior running back Dawson Lynch. The Tigers finished with five total turnovers. “Anytime you lose the turnover battle it’s hard to overcome,” Greg Harlan said. “Union was balanced all night long. We gave them short fields and they capitalized on them.” Ryan Harlan hit on 10-of-16 passes for 112 yards and two interceptions while rushing for 53 yards on 18 carries. Lynch rushed for 125 yards on 15 carries and caught four passes for 28 yards. Page 2 of 2 - Senior lineman Sam Williams made five solo tackles and three assists for the Tiger defense. “Defensively we were missing four starters due to injury,” Greg Harlan said. “That forced us to play more guys on both sides of the ball than we have been used to.” The Tigers end their conference schedule on Friday, hosting Pacific on STJ Senior Night, starting at 7 p.m. The score by periods: Union 21 21 0 0-42 St. James 0 6 0 6-12 The scoring plays: Union: Karim 11-yard run, Schumaker kick.
