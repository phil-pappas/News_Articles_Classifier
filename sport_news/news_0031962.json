CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCLARKSVILLE, Tenn. — Austin Peay State University women’s soccer team added its second Ohio Valley Conference victory of the season on Sunday by defeating UT Martin 3-1 at Morgan Brothers Soccer Field. The Lady Govs (6-5-0, 2-1 OVC) carried their offensive efficiency into the match to record 15 shots, handing the Skyhawks (4-8-0, 2-1 OVC) their first conference defeat. APSU pressed the opposition early in the first half, attempting three shots in the opening three minutes. After a feeling out process followed, sophomore Kirstin Robertson put the Lady Govs on the board first in the 31st minute. As freshman Isabel Holmes entered the contest, the midfielder played a through ball to Robertson, who made a run down the center of the pitch. The offside flag stayed down, and she capitalized with a shot which beat the keeper for her second goal of 2015. The Lady Govs out-shot UT Martin 8-3 in the first half, but the Skyhawks answered back in the 59th minute to knot the score. Amy McGivern gave a short pass to Sara Ketis just beyond the 18-yard box, and she fired it home for the equalizer. But as the clock ticked below 70 minutes, freshman McKenzie Dixon took over in her attacking midfield role. The two-time OVC Player of the Week scored the game-winning goal in the 72nd minute following a flick over the defense by Robertson which led to the score. In the 85th minute, Dixon would find the back of the net for the eighth time this season, collecting a short pass from junior Gina Fabbro in the box and powered it past the keeper’s right side. Sophomore goalkeeper Lindsey Todd improved to 2-0 on the weekend and 6-5 overall after earning the victory on Sunday. MaKenzie Crawford picked up the loss for the Skyhawks. Dixon finished with a four shots on the afternoon to lead APSU, while UTM’s Saphyrn Coombs-James led all players with six shots. Following a successful weekend, the Lady Govs will open a three-game road trip beginning at Jacksonville State at 7 p.m. Friday.
