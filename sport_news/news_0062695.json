It would appear as though his final cut will come to a defenseman, especially considering he publically said he’d rather carry seven than eight “in a perfect world.” \nHis world is far from perfect looking at the roster and the salaries that go along with it. \nThe “extra” players in Saturday’s practice were Vinny Lecavalier, Sam Gagner, Andrew MacDonald and Luke Schenn. Together, those four total $16.3 million in salary cap space while the other 20 accounted for $54.88 million. \nSalary isn’t everything in a determining factor, but it sure is important. Just look at the Edmonton Oilers, who Saturday played defenseman Nikita Nikitin and his $4.5 million cap hit on waivers. If he clears, the Oilers will send him to the American Hockey League and still have all but $950,000 of his cap hit on their books. \nThe Oilers did this because of roster space, but the Flyers might consider a move like that because they need the $950,000 of space. As it stands they have roughly $585,000, barely enough for one call-up depending on the player’s salary. \n“We’ll see when we work through things here,” Hextall said. “I’m a little bit of a deep thinker here, so I’ve got some more thinking to do and we’ll talk about it and we’ll make a move. Teams have to do what they’ve got to do whether it’s to get under the cap or on the roster. Every team is different in terms of the parts that have to move.” \nAnd if the Flyers do keep a high-priced player around as a spare part, they’re hoping it works better than it did last year when MacDonald, Schenn and Lecavalier all served time as healthy scratches, which took a toll on their confidence. \nNew coach Dave Hakstol figures that better not be a problem. \n“We want all our guys playing with confidence,” Hakstol said. “We all know there’s competition to be in the lineup. We don’t want guys in our lineup that are afraid to play. I don’t want guys in our lineup that are afraid to make a mistake. I want guys concentrating on doing the right thing and doing it confidently.” \nAside from the additions of defensemen Evgeny Medvedev and Radko Gudas, all the “regulars” in Saturday’s practice were the same as last year. \nHextall still thinks this team will be markedly different from last year’s squad that fell 14 points shy of the playoffs. \n“Why we’re going to be better, mainly is because our guys are going to be better from within,” Hextall said. “Some guys are going to bounce back. Hopefully we have some better chemistry in our lines. Hopefully we stay healthy, but to look and try to hit a home run every year and sign this guy and sign that guy to try to sign a 50-goal scorer to get better in the cap world, it doesn’t work. You’ve got to find the little ways from within.” Raffl plays a prank \nIt looks as though Scott Laughton has himself an NHL roster spot. He’s played well enough and clearly the Flyers want him to be on the final roster. His locker also moved from one end of the room, usually reserved for call-ups, to the other where established NHLers sit. \nHis new spot is between Michael Raffl and Pierre-Edouard Bellemare. \nRaffl took it a step further, removing Laughton’s magnetic nameplate and taping it to a trash can, then putting the trash can on the seat of the stall. \n“Congrats, Laughts!” a few of the players teased. \nLater they admitted it was only a prank and they didn’t know if the 2012 first-round pick actually made the team…but it’s still looking good that that stall will be his for a while. Loose pucks \nThe team loaned right wing Colin McDonald and goalie Jason LaBarbera to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. Both cleared waivers last week. … Things got a little testy during faceoff drills when wingers Pierre-Edouard Bellemare and R.J. Umberger were hacking away at one another before the puck dropped. Teammates stepped in before the two really went at it. … Sunday is a day off from practice for the team. They’ll resume things on Monday at the Voorhees Skate Zone. \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com . 5 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1LanhrF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:15:08.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
