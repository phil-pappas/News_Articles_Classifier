(Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) Stop the football whining, will you? \nLook, I understand that the 49ers and Raiders are not satisfying the souls of their tribal followers these days. The teams are on track for losing seasons and have obvious flaws that are inciting fans to scream at their televisions, their pets, their melted nacho cheese bowls and their FanDuel accounts. \n(Actually, people are screaming at all fantasy accounts and advertisements, no matter the brand. So do yourself a favor. Delete the fantasy apps and play Candy Crush, for heaven's sake.) \nBut that's all about pro football. Citizens, I have checked the U.S. Constitution. It turns out that just because an NFL team is in your geographical zone, federal law does not require you to spend hour after hour obsessing over what is wrong -- or even pay attention to the team at all on a daily basis.

(Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group) ( ANDA CHU ) \nEspecially when, around here, there are such entertaining and upbeat alternatives in the very same sport. \nHave you paused lately to gaze upon our present Northern California college football landscape? \nStanford, Cal and San Jose State have never all reached bowl games in the same season. It could realistically happen for the first time this year. The Bay Area could go three-for-three. \nSome might point to bowl inflation as the reason. And it's true that there are far more postseason games today than, say, in 1893. That was the first time all three schools fielded football teams in the same season. But I say that no matter how a 122-year streak has developed and unfolded ... well, a 122-year streak is still a 122-year streak. Advertisement \nAnd the streak must end. I decree this to be so. I also predict that it will happen. \nCal is 5-1 and needs just one more win to be bowl eligible, with home games remaining against very beatable Oregon State and very troubled USC. \nStanford is 4-1 and faces all of its toughest opponents at home the rest of the way, including UCLA on Thursday night, with the only road trips left to Washington State and Colorado. San Jose State's Tyler Ervin, middle, runs for a first down against Fresno State in the first quarter at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, Calif., on Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015. (Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group/TNS) ( Jim Gensheimer ) \nSan Jose State is 3-3 but is playing in the weaker half of the Mountain West Conference. The Spartans could easily be favored against all remaining opponents except BYU and Boise State. This distinction is important because San Jose State coach Ron Caragher implied after a September loss at Oregon State that the Spartans should never be expected to win if they are underdogs. The logical flip side, then, is that there is no possible way the Spartans should ever lose when they are favored. So I'm looking for a 7-5 finish. Look out, Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. \nSeriously, I can't remember the last time it was more pleasurable to follow the college game by the Bay. Let me list the reasons: \nCal coach Sonny Dykes, who had to devote so much time during his first two or three seasons cleaning up academic and roster issues, is finally showing he can coach football. His offense is a must-see attraction, with future first-round draft pick Jared Goff at quarterback. It was nuts last Saturday when the Bears were still in the game during the final minute despite Goff's five interceptions. But it was a good kind of nuts. The Foster Farms Bowl at Levi's Stadium is salivating about the prospect of pairing the Bears against a Big Ten team like Penn State or Iowa. \nSan Jose State running back Tyler Ervin might be an even more sure-thing NFL prospect than Goff, just because quarterbacks are still such a roll of the dice at the next level. Ervin is leading the country in all-purpose yardage. He is often the best player on the field on a given Saturday. \nErvin's counterpart at Stanford is Christian McCaffrey, the all-purpose Swiss Army Knife running back. Cardinal coach David Shaw keeps finding creative ways to utilize him. It's too early to anoint Stanford as a BCS Bowl team (or whatever we call the bowls that once were BCS Bowls), but how could you not make that call if the Cardinal does defeat UCLA? Stanford's last two regular-season conference games are at home against Oregon and Cal. Wouldn't it be something if that last one decides the Pac-12 West title? \nOf course, it's a free country. You can keep giving 100 percent of your attention to the 49ers and Raiders, if you wish. Like other parts of the nation where NFL teams share markets with college teams, the Bay Area is susceptible to a condition that I call the \"Boomer Berman Syndrome,\" in which the local population is tricked into believing that if someone is shouting loudly about teams and games being important and crucially monumental, that means it must be true. \nNot so. This autumn in the Bay Area, the college game is having more fun. But if you still can't shake your NFL codependency, here is a suggestion: \nAs part of the celebration of Super Bowl 50 at Levi's Stadium, the eight combined Lombardi trophies belonging to the two Bay Area franchises will be showcased in the tailgate area before Saturday's game at Spartan Stadium between San Jose State and San Diego State. So if you are a fan of the 49ers or Raiders, you can walk through the display and revisit past glories. \nAfter that, you can then stroll inside to visit current football splendor. Who knows? It might be another 122 years before this happens again.
