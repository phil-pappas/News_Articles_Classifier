QB Luke Shiflett throws this bomb to Will Blanchard who pulls it in for a big gain.Shiflett keeps it this time and scampers down the field and slides between tacklers and continues into the end zone. To cap off their next drive, hand it to Dominique Sistrunk who goes up the middle untouched for their second TD.After run, run, run, Ridgeland finally throws and it pays off with this pass from Ivy Boehm to Markeith Montgomery to get them on the board.Northwest answers back again with another strike from Shiflett.This time to Jon Tant who overcomes a called pass interference, still makes the reception, and then does the rest with his feet for the TD. The fun begins when the extra point snap is bobbled, but Tanner Boyd does some quick thinking, and runs it in for 2, but fumbles, and it's recovered by Northwest after some deliberating, the Refs rule, 2 points!In the end the final score was 43-29, Northwest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:37:37.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
