Week Seven of the 2015 season looks at big games for coaches like Mark Richt, who won't get fired, but has the pressure on.\nAdChoices E-mail Rich Cirminiello\nFollow me ... @RichCirminiello\n10. Bob Stoops, Oklahoma\n© David Purdy/Getty Images Head coach Bob Stoops of the Oklahoma Sooners watches from the sidelines in the second half of play against the Iowa State Cyclones on Nov. 1 in Ames, Iowa. © Andrew Weber/USA TODAY Sports Oklahoma Sooners head coach Bob Stoops on the sidelines during the second quarter against the West Virginia Mountaineers at Milan Puskar Stadium on Sept. 20, 2014 in Morgantown, W.Va.\nIs Stoops sitting on the same hot seat as, say, Virginia’s Mike London? Of course not – this is a different sort of category considering the high expectations for a program that’s shooting for the College Football Playoff. That could still happen – win out and it’s in – but after inexplicably boosting Charlie Strong’s job security last weekend, Stoops and his Sooners can ill-afford to lose to Kansas State on Saturday. The Sooners have now flopped as a double-digit favorite in each of the last five years, a troubling trend for the staff in particular. Oklahoma needs to bounce back in Manhattan or another promising is going to fall short of expectations.\n9. Mark Richt, Georgia\n© Provided by Campus Insiders Just like Bob Stoops, Richt is on a different sort of hot seat – the bar is set differently. There’s so much to like about Richt … unless your bar is set at winning championships. Yeah, Richt has averaged more than nine wins over his 15 seasons in Athens, but his last SEC title was a decade ago. Ten years between championships is unacceptable for a program with so much history in such a talent-rich state. And these latest back-to-back losses to Alabama and Tennessee reinforce in the minds’ of Richt’s detractors an inability to get over the hump. The heat will soar if the Dawgs stumble to Mizzou this week Between the Hedges.\n8. Dana Holgorsen, West Virginia\n© Getty Images FORT WORTH, TX - NOVEMBER 02: Head coach Dana Holgorsen of the West Virginia Mountaineers watches from the sidelines during the game against the TCU Horned Frogs at Amon G. Carter Stadium on November 2, 2013 in Fort Worth, Texas. (Photo by Jamie Squi Holgorsen is running out of time in Morgantown. He started so fast with the Mountaineers, capping a 10-win debut in 2011 with a record-shattering 70-33 blowout of Clemson in the Orange Bowl. But Holgo has never approached his early success, slipping below .500 since West Virginia joined the Big 12 in 2012. And a fast start this fall has been displaced by consecutive losses to Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, with trips to Baylor and TCU up next. Holgorsen needed to coach the ‘Neers to higher ground in 2015, but that’s looking increasingly unlikely.\n7. Charlie Strong, Texas\n© Cooper Neill/Getty Images Texas Longhorns head coach Charlie Strong looks on during warmups before kickoff against the North Texas Mean Green on August 30, 2014 at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas. While no one is rushing to Strong’s office with a pen and a contract extension, stunning Oklahoma takes a ton of pressure off the coach … for now. The Longhorns showcased their potential in the 24-17 win, with enough defensive pressure and offensive ingenuity to hand the Sooners their first loss. Strong definitively deserves at least a third year to continue cleaning up Mack Brown’s mess. He can take a giant step toward a 2016 return by building off the weekend and rolling against a soft second-half schedule.\n6. Frank Beamer,Virginia Tech\n© Andrew Weber/USA TODAY Sports Virginia Tech Hokies head coach Frank Beamer The Hokies snapped a two-game slide by beating NC State on Friday night, 28-13. Still, the narrative surrounding Beamer in the twilight of his career hasn’t changed. Despite returning more lettermen and starters than any other ACC program, his squad is 3-3 and unable to dodge mediocrity for a fourth year in a row. Beamer and AD Whit Babcock issued a joint statement last December, stating that the football team wasn’t meeting expectations. Almost a year later, it still isn’t.\n5. Paul Rhoads, Iowa State\n© Charlie Neibergall/AP Iowa State head coach Paul Rhoads. The Cyclones were competitive for a quarter in Lubbock. And then the Texas Tech offense took complete control with 776 yards, nine touchdowns and a lot of reps for the backups. Call it a harbinger of things to come, with TCU and Baylor in the on-deck circle, as Iowa State begins the slow descent to a sixth straight losing season. Ames is a tough place to win, but sometimes a staff shakeup is necessary to alter a program’s outlook and direction.\n4. Darrell Hazell, Purdue\n© Joe Robbins/Getty Images Head coach Darrell Hazell of the Purdue Boilermakers looks on against the Indiana Hoosiers during the game at Memorial Stadium on Nov. 29, 2014 in Bloomington, Ind. This just isn’t working. A week after putting a scare into Michigan State, the Boilermakers reverted back to old habits, getting outcoached and outplayed after halftime by Minnesota. Purdue has now dropped four in a row, beating only FCS Indiana State, and is 1-17 in Big Ten games under Hazell. Declining attendance is also doing no favors to the coach’s job security. A year after posting its lowest attendance since 1951, Purdue played in front of another half-empty Ross-Ade Stadium Saturday.\n3. Al Golden, Miami\n© Steve Helber/AP Photo Miami coach Al Golden reacts to a call during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. on Oct. 23, 2014. Golden is long past the point of moral victories. Solid effort in Tallahassee, but you have to win one of these at some point. Saturday’s 29-24 loss pushed Golden to 0-5 versus Jimbo Fisher and a game below .500 in ACC play through four-plus years. Put differently, no one from Golden’s first recruiting class can ever say he defeated rival Florida State, and that’s the kind of thing that derails a coach. Unless the Hurricanes rise up and win the Coastal Division, Golden could be jobless in two months.\n2. Kyle Flood, Rutgers\n© Mel Evans, File/AP Photo Rutgers coach Kyle Flood initially said he had not been contacted by university officials about a possible NCAA rules violation. Flood’s three-game suspension for inappropriate contact with an academic advisor to one of his players has been served. He’ll return for this week’s trip to Bloomington in a must-win game for the Scarlet Knights’ postseason hopes. After Norries Wilson struggled in an interim role, including late in Saturday’s loss to Michigan State, Rutgers needs Flood to bring leadership to the locker room and the field. The coach isn’t excelling away from the stadium, so now more than ever he has to stand out as a game day difference-maker.\n1. Mike London,Virginia\n© Don Juan Moore/Getty Images Head Coach Mike London of the Virginia Cavaliers during the game against the Florida State Seminoles at Doak Campbell Stadium on Bobby Bowden Field on Nov. 8, 2014 in Tallahassee, Fla. As the losses mount, London inches closer to the end of his Cavalier tenure. After bowing to Pitt Saturday, Virginia is winless against FBS teams and well on its way to another losing season. Barring a dramatic turnaround, London will have coached in one bowl game, a 2011 Chick-fil-A Bowl loss to Auburn, in six seasons. That’s woefully inadequate, particularly for a coach who’s done a solid job of filling the locker room with quality recruits from the Mid-Atlantic region.\nMORE: How much does it cost to replace a college football coach?\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://campusinsiders.com/news/cost-to-replace-college-football-coach-10-15-2015", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://twitter.com/RichCirminiello", "http://www.campusinsiders.com/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:49:11.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
