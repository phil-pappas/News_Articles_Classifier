Mandatory Credit: Brad Rempel-USA TODAY Sports - RTX1HZ32 Sports Xchange \nFlip Saunders will not return to coach the Minnesota Timberwolves this season while he undergoes treatment for cancer. \nSaunders sat out the preseason after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in June, but he was expected back at some point this season. However, he has been hospitalized since September after experiencing complications following the completion of chemotherapy. \nTimberwolves owner Glen Taylor confirmed the news on Friday. Asked about Saunders' return to the bench this season, Taylor said, \"Not this year. \n\"I just think his illness, I mean, it's serious. At this point, if he came back, I still think he'd have a hard time to recover all his energy and all that because he has been in the hospital for a long time.\" \nSam Mitchell has been coaching the team throughout the preseason in Saunders' absence and Milt Newton is handling the front-office responsibilities. Mitchell has experience as a head coach with the Toronto Raptors. \nThe 60-year-old Saunders is the winningest coach in franchise history.
