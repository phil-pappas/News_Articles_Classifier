The Clippers, who played most of the game with their fourth-string quarterback, performed admirably. But the Dolphins jumped out to a 14-0 first-quarter lead and held on for the victory. The Dolphins improved to 4-2 overall, 3-1 in the ACL. Falmouth dropped to 5-2, 2-2. D-Y, ranked eighth in Division 4 South, assured itself a spot in the playoffs with the victory. “I’m really proud of the way we pulled together,” D-Y coach Paul Funk said. “Falmouth is an excellent team, they’re really well-coached and it came right down to the end.” The Clippers were missing starting quarterback Nick Couhig and his backup, Collin Almeida. Hunter Scribner, returning from a broken foot that is not completely healed, lasted one possession. That left the ball in the hands of Tyler Brown, who played well, scoring their only touchdown. But a number of costly penalties and turnovers hurt the Clippers, with a fumble at the D-Y 7 with 6:56 remaining ending all hopes for a comeback. “We’re still doing some good things, but it just seems lately we make a bad play, whether it’s a penalty, a fumble, a miscommunication in the secondary,” said Falmouth coach Derek Almeida. “Whatever it is, it’s been magnified the last couple of weeks.” It was a strange first quarter. D-Y possessed the football for only 49 seconds, yet took a 14-0 lead. The Dolphins did it with a pair of explosive touchdowns. One came in the conventional fashion in the form of Andrew Jamiel’s 40-yard reception from Jacob McCarthy, while the other was a stunner. With the Clippers marching on the game’s opening possession, Scribner fumbled on a keeper and Josh Hernandez-Lacen scooped up the ball and raced 59 yards for the first score. Sam Capobianco added the kick for a 7-0 lead. “(Falmouth) is so tough with that triple option that you know time of possession is always going to be with them,” Funk said. “That fumble recovery to score was huge. They were physical up front and they pushed us around at times. It wasn’t easy tonight.” Already short-handed, the Clippers lost defensive lineman Yanni Rusko to a serious knee injury midway through the opening quarter after they recovered a D-Y fumble at their own 8. The game was delayed for nearly 30 minutes waiting for an ambulance to arrive, and the Clippers attempted to rally around their senior captain. But the elusive Jamiel, who was effectively shut down in the running game, got loose down the left sideline to give the Dolphins their second score with 2:12 left in the quarter. Both teams moved the ball in that quarter, but the Clippers shot themselves in the foot with penalties and the Dolphins turned the ball over on an interception at the Falmouth 5 with 22 seconds remaining. The Dolphins took a 20-0 lead when McCarthy connected with Tim Begley on fourth-and-nine from the 17 with 6:19 left in the third quarter. The Clippers finally found the end zone late in the quarter after Michael LaFrange returned the ensuing kickoff 59 yards to set them up at the D-Y 25. Brown’s keeper from 3 yards got the Clippers on the board.
