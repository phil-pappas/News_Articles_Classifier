Barea had 14 points and Charlie Villanueva added 10 points and six rebounds. \nCorey Brewer had 16 points for the Rockets and K.J.

He says no one had been there for the past two days. \nHe says evidence indicates foul pay may have been involved.

The steer weighs 2,100 pounds and has a horn span of 82 inches. \nTexas is 1-4 under second-year coach Charlie Strong, the Longhorns' worst start since 1956. \nAL WILD-CARD RATINGS \nWith Yankees, wild-card game draws biggest TV audience \nNEW YORK (AP) - With the Yankees playing, baseball's wild-card game has drawn its largest television audience in its short history. \nThe Houston Astros' 3-0 win over New York in the AL wild-card game Tuesday night on ESPN averaged more than 7.6 million viewers. \nThe network said Wednesday that's up 36 percent from the 5.6 million for last year's NL game between the Giants and Pirates on ESPN, which was the previous high. It's up 46 percent from the 5.2 million for the 2014 AL game between small-market Kansas City and Oakland on TBS. \nMajor League Baseball added the wild-card round in 2012. \nPATRIOTS-FACING HARDY \nPatriots will try to stop Greg Hardy in DL's Dallas debut \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) - Greg Hardy's mouth is preceding his production. \nThe Dallas Cowboys defensive end is returning to the field this week after serving a four-game suspension for roughing up his former girlfriend. His first opponent: The defending NFL champion New England Patriots, who are 3-0 under reigning Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady. \nAsked if it matters who the opponent is, Hardy said this week that he loves seeing Brady. And then he brought up Brady's wife, supermodel Gisele Bundchen. \n\"I hope she comes to the game,\" Hardy said. \"I hope her sister comes to the game, all her friends come to the game.\" \nAsked about Hardy's comments on Wednesday, Brady complimented Hardy but said he's just trying to prepare for the game. \nCOLTS-INJURIES \n3 injured Colts stay behind, but Luck heads to Houston \nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Colts quarterback Andrew Luck made the trip to Houston but three of his teammates stayed home. \nTeam officials said linebackers Jerrell Freeman and Bjoern Werner and running back Tyler Varga did not travel Wednesday. None of the three practiced this week. Freeman is out with a groin injury, Werner has an injured hamstring and Varga will miss his second straight game with a concussion. \nThe bigger question has been Luck, who was limited in practice this week with an injured right shoulder. \nHe missed his first pro game Sunday, ending a streak of 57 consecutive starts including playoffs. Luck said Tuesday he is preparing to start. \nIf he can't go, 40-year-old Matt Hasselbeck probably would. Hasselbeck missed Tuesday's practice because of illness. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
