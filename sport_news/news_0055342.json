We wanted to send our regular batsmen when the pitch eased out.\n\n\nDhawal Kulkarni \n\"I had prepared Dhawal to open. We wanted to do that in our last match (vs TN), but we did not bat first then. Dhawal played superbly.\nWe wanted him to see off the first 10 overs. He left the ball well,\" Pandit told mid-day.
