All three bouts were competitive. \nOn Friday, a Calgary promoter used O’Connell, Ford and Arsenault on a card against little-known opposition. Ford and O’Connell won by first-round knockouts against light-heavyweight and lightweight foes. Arsenault was stopped in the third round of his heavyweight clash. The evidence is clear that true competition was not part of any bout. \nBut spectators paid the full price. \nWhat has that to with Hayter? Only that he used his influence with promoters here and in other communities to encourage fair entertainment for a fair price. \nAt one point, he insisted an overseer should be appointed to check the records and other credentials of all combatants in the ring. I agreed it was necessary in those days. It’s still necessary. \n••• \nAs for baseball, it’s fair to ask how many fans recognize the names Kyle Lohse, Mike Cuddyer, A.J. Hinch, Rusty Kuntz, Gary Pettis and so many more. \nAll played in the majors after serving as Trappers. Cuddyer will be part of the New York Mets series with the Chicago Cubs. Hinch managed the Houston Astros, who bowed to Kansas City in one American League semifinal. \nKuntz is a coach with the Kansas City Royals. Pettis, a brilliant outfielder, coached with Houston. \nIn the last week or so, city representatives issued an invitation to citizens interested in keeping Telus Field open and active for top-level baseball. We’ll never get the Trappers or the Pacific Coast League back, but it’s my fervent hope that this community stays in organized baseball. \njcshort@shaw.ca Politicians like former city coun.
