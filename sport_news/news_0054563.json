But shortly after Clinton said she has \"serious concerns\" about health insurer Aetna's plan to acquire Humana and Anthem's proposal to buy Cigna, Humana's share price began a dip.\nBy the market close on Thursday, the Louisville-based company's share price hit $165.11, a decline of $12.04 over the prior day. At one point Thursday, the price fell to $162.21.\nAetna's price also fell nearly $5 per share on Thursday, to $103.41.\nClinton said in a statement Wednesday that \"as we see more consolidation in health care, among both providers and insurers, I'm worried that the balance of power is moving too far away from consumers. ... These mergers should be scrutinized very closely with an eye to preventing the undue concentration that they appear to create.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nHumana shareholders sue to block Aetna deal\nClinton is leading the race for the party's nomination and previously criticized the pharmaceutical industry for \"price gouging,\" a comment sure to catch the attention of senior voters. She indicated she'd cap out-of-pocket prescription costs at $250 a month.\nAetna and Humana shareholders on Monday overwhelmingly backed a proposal for Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna to buy Humana for $37 billion, a deal announced last July. Within weeks, Anthem made a successful bid to buy Cigna for $48 billion. Both deals must get the green light from federal regulators and state insurance agencies.\nIf the purchases are OK'd, three companies would dominate the U.S. health insurance market -- Anthem, United Health and Aetna -- roughly in order of size.\nMany consumer advocates, as well as doctors and hospital groups, have urged federal regulators now reviewing the acquisitions to look closely at the impact on consumers when competition is reduced dramatically in thousands of U.S. markets.\nIn the Aetna-Humana deal, Aetna executives have said they have been \"conservative\" in planning for divestitures in areas where the companies overlap significantly, but they've expressed confidence that the transaction will go through, probably in the second half of 2016.\nStill, the timing of next year's election in November and regulators' review wrapping up next year may raise concerns for investors.\nClinton didn't pull punches: \"As we see more consolidation in health care, among both providers and insurers, I'm worried that the balance of power is moving too far away from consumers,\" she said in a statement.\nReporter Grace Schneider can be reached at 502-582-4082 or by email, gschneider@courier-journal.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9ea4ecbf0f0061343a8c94349e515d9924e64009/c=0-0-233-233/local/-/media/2015/08/25/Louisville/Louisville/635761183442221865-HumanaEntrance.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:43:04.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
