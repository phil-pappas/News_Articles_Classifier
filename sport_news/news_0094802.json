(AP) - The ex-boyfriend of a Bogalusa woman whose body was found in a burned-out vehicle near the village of Sun is in custody in connection with her death as is his brother.\nThe St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office says 53-year-old Gary Lee Harris was booked Monday with the second-degree murder of 41-year-old Nanette Me'Shell King of Bogalusa. His brother, 64-year-old Ray Harris, was booked with accessory-after-the-fact to second-degree murder.\nKing had been missing since Sept. 20 after leaving the Shell gas station in Bush where she worked. Two women searching for an old trailer found the car in thick woods near Sun last week.\nSheriff Jack Strain said during a news conference that King was strangled to death before her body and vehicle were taken to a secluded area and torched.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
