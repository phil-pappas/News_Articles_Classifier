Original post, 6:47 a.m. December 17, 2012: The senseless massacre in Newtown, Connecticut , which took the lives of twenty children, including Olivia Engel, seen here, plus seven adults, instantly stirs terrible memories of the 1999 attack on Columbine High School . On the tenth anniversary of that tragedy, we assembled a horrific roster of school shootings in the decade since Columbine, based on data from the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence . In updating that list below, we discovered that there have been 73 more school shootings since our 2009 post — at least.\nA photo of Columbine High School from April 20, 1999. We add this last caveat because the Brady Campaign document, entitled \"Major School Shootings in the United States Since 1997,\" was assembled this past February — and given the rate of shootings seen in the document, it's likely a dozen more incidents or more have taken place in the nearly ten months since the most recent entry.\nAs you'll note, these events don't all involve mass casualties. Indeed, some of them don't even result in an injury. But the majority involve injuries or deaths — often multiple ones — and it's extraordinarily disturbing to realize that most of them didn't make national news. The average item was likely treated as a local news item in the towns where they took place — an indication of how inured we've become to the idea of shootings at our nation's schools.\nWe think the total number of incidents listed here is 179, but we could have lost count. That's how many of them there've been since the Columbine attack.
