The Lions will also be without linebacker DeAndre Levy, who the team says has been dealing with hip issues. \nDetroit is the league's only remaining winless team, and the offense sputtered so badly last weekend against Arizona that quarterback Matthew Stafford was benched. Ebron's absence puts more pressure on receivers Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate in the passing game. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:09:13.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
