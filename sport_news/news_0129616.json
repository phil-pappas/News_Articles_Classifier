Council Grove beats West Franklin 42-15, secures first FHL title since 2006 by Stephen Coleman stephen@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nCOUNCIL GROVE — One thing was certain for the Council Grove High School football team on Friday. Win, and they’re in. A victory over West Franklin would ensure the Braves at least a share of the Flint Hills League title. If a win was coupled with a loss by Lyndon, the title would be outright. \nLyndon eventually came out on top of Osage City 34-28, but the Braves’ mentality, after a 42-15 win, was very much that of champions. \n“It means so much to us, that’s been our goal for four years,” CGHS senior Peyton Lerner said. “All the hours you spent in the weight room, it’s all coming true now...our dreams are coming true, (as) league champs.” \nCouncil Grove marched down on its opening drive, with Braden Reddick scoring on an 11-yard run less than four minutes into the game. Reddick hauled in a 14-yard touchdown catch a bit later to extend the Braves’ lead to 15-0 at the end of the first quarter. \n“Our offense, we have multiple threats,” CGHS head coach Nate Teichgraber said. “We put a lot of pressure on the defense to have to be honest and cover those threats. When they do that, we’ve got good athletes that can make plays and our playmakers made plays.” \nReddick finished the game with 201 yards rushing and two scores, including a 94-yard breakaway late in the second quarter. \n“He runs like his tail’s on fire,” Lerner said of his sophomore teammate. “He works hard for us all the time.” \nAlso crossing the goal line for the Braves was quarterback Trey Langvardt, who ran in a score from nine yards out. Senior Hunter Cowdin made it 28-0 on an 11-yard pass from Langvardt and Chandler White broke through for a 68-yard touchdown run. \nWest Franklin scored twice late to avoid the shutout, but several chances early on were silenced by the Council Grove defense. The Braves recovered two West Franklin fumbles and also held the Falcons out of the end zone for a full possession in the red zone. \n“The defense was great,” Langvardt said. “I can lean on them no matter what. We’ve trusted in them all season, it’s been huge.” \nTeichgraber agreed. \n“All year, our defense has played outstanding, specifically in the red zone,” he said. “We work on red zone defense every week and the kids come out on Friday nights and really do a nice job of executing.” \nAt 5-1, the Braves will stand atop the Flint Hills League for the first time since 2006 and look on to the approaching district play. \n“I’m very proud of the boys,” Teichgraber said. “We’ve got great men of character here in Council Grove. The way that those guys improved from week one ‘til now just shows their character. We have some great athletes, they came together ... we kept our goals in sight and they did a nice job.” \nWest Franklin 0 0 7 8 —15 \nCouncil Grove 15 20 7 0 —42", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:21:28.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
