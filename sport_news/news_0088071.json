FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform, and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach.\" \nThat call was echoed by McDonald's, which has been a World Cup sponsor since 1994. \n\"The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of FIFA and public confidence in its leadership,\" the fast food giant said in a statement. \"We believe it would be in the best interest of the game for FIFA President Sepp Blatter to step down immediately so that the reform process can proceed with the credibility that is needed.\" \nA further blow came from Visa, which has a FIFA deal through the 2022 World Cup. \n\"We believe no meaningful reform can be made under FIFA's existing leadership,\" Visa said. \"And given the events of last week, it's clear it would be in the best interest of FIFA and the sport for Sepp Blatter to step down immediately.\" \nThe fourth statement was delivered by brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose Budweiser branding has appeared on hoardings in World Cup stadiums since 1986 and the current deal runs until 2022. \n\"It would be appropriate for Mr. Blatter to step down as we believe his continued presence to be an obstacle in the reform process,\" the beer maker said in a statement. \nBlatter's own position has been weakened as lawyers oversee key decisions at scandal-battered FIFA and he waits to hear whether he will be suspended by the ethics committee. \nEnglish Football Association chairman Greg Dyke called the strong intervention from sponsors \"a game changer\" that should prevent Blatter from staying until the Feb. 26 election. \n\"It doesn't matter what Mr. Blatter says now, if the people who pay for FIFA want a change they will get a change,\" Dyke said. \"What is important is that it isn't just about Mr. Blatter standing down, it's about making sure there is a comprehensive and effective reform programme. \n\"So for those of us who want fundamental change this is good news.\" \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:17:38.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
