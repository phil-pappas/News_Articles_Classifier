Now only the Miss Norma K and Norma K III remain as part of their fleet of fishing boats.\n\"It broke our heart. I watched every piece of that boat being put together,\" said Norma Keller. \"There was a lot of sentimental value in it.\"\nKeller, now 75, was a teenager when the boat was built. It was 1964, the year the World's Fair was in New York City. But instead of going to the exhibits, Keller went to Deebold Boat Works in Atlantic City to see carpenters heat and bend mahogany to make the next boat in her family's growing fleet of party boats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:09:08.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
