The return gave the Giants a 27-20 lead and they never looked back.\n“First career return, coming against my old team, it felt good man,” Harris said. “I got out of there and the only thing I was thinking is ‘I hope there’s no flags on the play.”\nThe win came six days after the New York Giants’ sloppiest performance of the season. Coach Tom Coughlin’s defense made life miserable for Cassel, making his first start of the season, forcing five Dallas (2-4) turnovers. In one of the critical differences in the game, the Giants had zero turnovers.\n“That was a very good offense, defense and special teams win. The contributions from all three were superior, ” Coughlin said.\nGiants quarterback Eli Manning had a quiet game, going 13 of 24 with 170 yards and no touchdowns. Jon Beason led the Giants (4-3) defense with 11 combined tackles.\nRunning back Orleans Darkwa, who had yet to get a carry this season, got New York off to a quick start with the Giants only score in the first half. He finished the game with 48 yards on eight carries. Shane Vereen had 56 yards on four carries.\nAfter Dallas jumped to a 13-10 lead in the first half, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie opened the third quarter with a pick-six, giving the Giants a 17-13 lead. On the next drive, it was safety Brandon Meriweather’s turn for an interception. Meriweather came away with a wobbly deep ball in the direction of Cowboys receiver Terrance Williams, giving him an interception in back-to-back games.\nThe Giants capitalized, with a 83 yard drive, highlighted by a 44-yard pass from Manning to Rueben Randle. Josh Brown scored the field goal to make it 20-13. It looked like the game was over when Rodgers-Cromartie intercepted a pass intended for Brice Butler.\nBut Cassel charged the Cowboys down the field, on a nine-play, 80-yard drive, capped by a pass to Street to tie the game.\nBut moments later, Harris’s record-tying 100-yard touchdown return sent the crowd of 80,319 into a frenzy.\nIt’s only right the game was tightly contested throughout the game. The Giants are now in first place in the NFC East but far from an outright favorite.\nThe division remains up for grabs as injuries—like the one to Cowboys starting quarterback Tony Romo—have changed the division’s landscape. Cassel was the third quarterback to start for the Cowboys this season after Brandon Weeden stepped in after Romo broke his collarbone in Week 2.\nBut that hasn’t resulted in a void of leadership, according to Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. After Sunday’s game, Jones said one of the “real leaders” of the team, was the oft-maligned Greg Hardy, who was arrested for assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2014.\n“He earns it and he earns it with respect from all of his teammates and that’s the kind of thing that inspires a football team,” Jones said referring to Hardy motiving his teammates on the sideline throughout Sunday.\nThe Washington Redskins improved to 3-4 on the season after a 31-30 come-from-behind victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, rallying from a 24-point deficit. The Philadelphia Eagles were 3-3, heading into Sunday night’s game against the 5-0 Carolina Panthers.\nThe Giants came out on top on Sunday but given the unpredictable nature of this team and their season to date, the future remains far from certain.\nWrite to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:46:26.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
