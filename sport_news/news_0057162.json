Bonilla made his big-league debut in 2014, going 3-0 with a 3.05 ERA in five games with the Rangers. \nIn 170 games over six minor league seasons, Bonilla is 27-20 with 15 saves and a 3.17 ERA. \nHe was originally signed by Philadelphia in 2008 out of the Dominican Republic and traded to Texas in 2012, when he was a selection in the Futures game as part of All-Star festivities. \nThe move was announced Wednesday. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:53:49.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
