Her classmates were startled, and the room got quiet, but her instructor soon resumed teaching.\nThen, again: pop, pop.\nHannah said her Writing 121 instructor, Amy Fair, knocked on the door of the adjoining classroom, where Hannah said it seemed like the noises were coming from.\nThere was no answer and then three to five more pops, Hannah said, and she remembers Fair saying the class needed to leave.\nHannah described the harrowing events from the Douglas County Fairgrounds, where students were evacuated to after a mass shooting at the community college Thursday. Officials confirmed 10 people are dead, including the gunman, and seven were wounded.\nFamily members have met the students at the fairgrounds, and law enforcement and crisis intervention personnel are on hand.\nHannah said she left her keys and wallet in the classroom, and she and her classmates ran toward the center of campus, where they were ushered into a small room in the campus bookstore.\nFair, Hannah said, was encouraging other students to join them as they ran.\nWhile in the bookstore, Hannah said, she was able to borrow a phone to call her father, who she said prayed for her on the phone.\nSheriff John Hanlin confirms ten fatalities in UCC shooting Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin spoke to the press Thursday afternoon, confirming that there were ten fatalities and seven injuries in the shooting at Umpqua Community College this morning.\nThe people in the room didn't open the door for the first person who told them it was OK to come out, Hannah said, and they were hesitant to even open the door when the police told them to.\nShe said opening the door was a huge sigh of relief because that's when she knew they were going to be OK.\nHer mother, Sandy Miles, who said she's a respiratory therapist at Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg, said she was at work when she was called to help in the emergency department, with the arrival of as many as 20 trauma patients.\nAt first, she said, she thought it might be a drill. But she said she soon realized that it wasn't after hearing the panic in their voices.\nShe said she tried to call her daughter using a coworker's phone but didn't get a response. She said she then called her husband, who also didn't pick up, because he was on the phone with Hannah.\nSandy said he called back shortly thereafter, though, to let her know that Hannah was safe.\nSandy said her daughter is getting her prerequisites for nursing school and was supposed to work on Thursday at Callahan Court Memory Care, where Sandy said she's a caregiver.\nSandy said her daughter was worried about missing work and asked her to call Callahan Court Memory Care to let her colleagues know what happened.\nCheck back with The Oregonian/OregonLive for more from Roseburg.\n-- Carli Brosseau; Jim Ryan\ncbrosseau@oregonian.com ; jryan@oregonian.com\n503-294-5121; 503-221-8005\n@carlibrosseau ; @Jimryan015", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/carlibrosseau", "http://twitter.com/jimryan015"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:16:09.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
