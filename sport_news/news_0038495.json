Over 30 aid workers have been killed.\nThe coalition of non-governmental organisations, who say they provide up to 90 percent of aid on the ground, warned of a \"continued deterioration in the humanitarian situation\", with fighting spreading to Western Equatoria state in the south of the country, which has previously been mainly peaceful.\nIn the battleground Unity state, key aid agencies have been forced to pull out of Leer, Mayendit and Koch counties after escalation in fighting in recent weeks.\n\"At least 1,000 civilians were killed, 1,300 women and girls were raped, and 1,600 women and children were abducted in Leer, Mayendit and Koch,\" the NGO Forum said, quoting a September assessment report which detailed atrocities over the previous six months.\nSouth Sudan descended into bloodshed in December 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused Riek Machar, whom he had sacked as his deputy six months previously, of planning a coup.\nOver 630,000 civilians have fled as refugees to neighbouring nations, while over 1.6 million have fled their homes inside South Sudan -- including some 185,000 civilians sheltering inside United Nations peacekeeper camps.\nThe UN on Wednesday warned that more than a third of the country -- over 4.6 million people -- are in desperate need of food aid, classifying in them as \"severely food insecure\".\nThe Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which makes detailed technical assessments of hunger, are expected to release their latest report later this month.\nAid workers say they fear \"pockets\" of possible famine -- a disaster caused by war, not by climatic conditions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:04:56.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
