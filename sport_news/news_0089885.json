Kameda (33-2, 18 knockouts) was penalized by the referee Celestino Ruiz in the third round for low blows, forcing Kono to take a knee at one point. \n\nRuiz's patience seemed to wear thin in the seventh as he threatened to halt the bout if either of the fighters committed any more fouls. \n\nKono pressed the attack in the final two rounds, which impressed the judges who awarded him the bout by scores of 115-109, 116-108 and 113-111. \n\nHe lost world title fights in 2008 and 2010 before his breakthrough in 2012 with a fourth-round knockout of Thailand's Tepparith Kokietgym for the WBA crown. \n\nVenezuela's Liborio Solis took the title with a majority decision in 2013 but Kono reclaimed it last year with an eighth-round knockout over Thailand's Denkaosan Kaovichit. \n\nKameda, a 28-year-old southpaw nicknamed \"The Fist of Osaka,\" had won 11 fights in a row entering the Chicago matchup.
