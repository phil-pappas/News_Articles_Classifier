That’s a tough thing, but at the same time, it’s a positive thing because these are games we expect to win now. We go out and play with that kind of attitude, and it hurts because we know the game was very winnable for us.”\nThe loss was a setback to the effort by the Rebels (2-4, 1-1 Mountain West) to become bowl eligible and be a West Division contender. The Rebels are helped that there is no dominant team in the division, and the winner probably will have at least one conference loss.\n“That’s going to be a tougher road, but it’s still doable,” Sanchez said.\nUNLV next plays at Fresno State on Friday, and whether Blake Decker is the starting quarterback hasn’t been determined. He didn’t play against San Jose State (3-3, 2-1) because of a separated nonthrowing (left) shoulder, and Kurt Palandech went the whole way.\nPalandech start strong, struggled for much of the game, and made some key plays down the stretch in completing 15 of 30 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions. He also led the Rebels in rushing with 47 yards on 18 carries.\nSan Jose State’s leading rusher was Ervin, who gained 73 yards on 18 attempts. That total was 87 yards below his season average because the Rebels made stopping Erving their priority.\n“Ervin’s a great player,” Sanchez said. “We did a very good job against him. They couldn’t go to him and win the game. We forced them to do other things.”\nNamely pass. Kenny Potter, who missed the two previous games with a sprained ankle, started at quarterback for the Spartans and completed 30 of 48 passes for 329 yards and two touchdowns, with an interception.\nErvin, though, was a factor, catching eight passes for 74 yards and a TD. And when the Spartans needed him late, Ervin delivered with 52 yards rushing in the fourth quarter and overtime, and he scored the go-ahead touchdown late in regulation as well as the winner in overtime.\nOT didn’t look possible for UNLV entering the quarter behind 20-10 and its offense showing no signs of life while it defense kept the Rebels within striking range.\nThat play by the defense became critical when the momentum switched when Ervin muffed a punt early in the fourth quarter, and UNLV’s Peni Vea recovered at the Spartans’ 36-yard line. Four plays later, Palandech connected down the middle to tight end Andrew Price for a 25-yard touchdown to bring the Rebels within 20-17 with 10:23 left.\nAfter UNLV’s defense came up big again, the offense got a shot to tie or go ahead. But the situation looked bleak for the Rebels when Palandech had to scramble on third-and-13. He bought enough time, however, to find Kendal Keys open deep for a 49-yard completion to the 24.\nThat set up Palandech’s 22-yard scoring pass to Devonte Boyd with 3:41 left to put the Rebels in front 24-20.\nBack came the Spartans, who drove to UNLV’s 21. The Rebels’ defense played aggressively on the first three downs, forcing three incomplete passes. They went aggressive on fourth down as well, but San Jose State called a throw-back screen pass that Potter completed to Ervin for an easy 21-yard touchdown and 27-24 lead with 1:08 left.\nThat turned out to be enough time for UNLV to put together its own drive, and UNLV’s Nicolai Bornand made a 49-yard field goal with 11 seconds remaining to send the game into overtime.\nWhen given the chance in overtime to take the lead, though, Bornand’s kick was low and blocked.\nThe game felt over. It would be in just in a few minutes when Ervin scored from 2 yards out.\n“At the end of the day, they made a one more play than we did,” Sanchez said. “We’re right there.”\nContact Mark Anderson at manderson@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2914.
