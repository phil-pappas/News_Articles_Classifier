Cozens on October 22,   \nJohn Jay senior Anya Ivenitsky advanced to today’s Section 1 girls tennis singles championship match, after pulling a three-set win over Courtney Ollis of Suffern on Wednesday in the semifinals. \nShe faces fourth-seeded Sydney Kaplan of Suffern in today’s final, at Harrison High School. \nIvenitsky lost the first set on Wednesday to Ollis on a tiebreaker, but came back to win the next two sets, and the match, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-3. \nKaplan scored a three-set win over Maranda Sears of Arlington in the other semifinal, 2-6, 6-1, 7-5. \nIvenitsky is the first John Jay girls tennis player to ever reach the section finals. She also qualified for the state tournament. She is only the second John Jay girls tennis player to do so — and the first since CeCe Crystal in 2006, after finishing third at sectionals. \nShe is only the third John Jay tennis player, boy or girl, to ever reach the section championship match, the others being Nick Crystal in 2011 and Hayden Cassone last spring. \nThe state tournament will be held Oct. 31-Nov. 2 at Tri-City Fitness in Latham. \nIvenitsky, John Jay’s number-one singles player during the season, has won all three of her matches in the section tournament in three sets. \nIn the quarterfinals on Tuesday, also at Harrison High School, she rallied from a set down to beat the second seed, Mayu Tezuka of Keio Academy, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2. \nShe went to three sets to win her first-round match in a marathon, beating Ashley Granieri of Scarsdale, 6-1, 4-6, 7-5. Anya Ivenitsky is the first John Jay girls tennis player to ever reach the finals of the Section 1 singles tournament. — J.B.
