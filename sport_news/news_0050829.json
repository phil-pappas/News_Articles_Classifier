The shootings at Umpqua Community College have set off intense commentary over gun rights and mental illness and have prompted comment from those in the public eye. Here are just a few of the most talked about statements:\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson told two television networks that victims should rush the gunman in situations like the one in Roseburg. Though his remarks were widely criticized as blaming the victims, he doubled down Wednesday. \"From the indications I got, they didn't rush the shooter,\" he said Wednesday on The Huffington Post. If enough people were to attack the gunman, he argued, \"the likelihood of him killing as many people would diminish significantly.\"\nHillary Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to tighten regulations on firearms buyers and sellers with a combination of congressional and executive action. Clinton decried the \"extremism\" that she said has come to characterize the debate over the nation's gun laws.\n\"This epidemic of gun violence knows no boundaries, knows no limits of any kind,\" she said, according to The Associated Press. \"How many people have to die before we actually act, before we come together as a nation? It's time for us to say we're better than this.\" In addition to expanding background checks, she proposed repealing legislation that shields gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers of firearms from most liability suits.\nThe publisher of a weekly paper in Roseburg said President Barack Obama would not be welcome in the community. David Jacques told Bill O'Reilly that Obama wanted to \"stand on the corpses of our loved ones\" to make a political point. After the shootings, Obama had said:\n\"We are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.\n\"Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, \"The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws -- even in the face of repeated mass killings.\" And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana. That day! Somehow this has become routine.\"\nRepublican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal blamed the gunman's father for the mass shootings, saying \"he's the problem.\"\nJindal wrote about American culture allowing boys to be raised on violent video games, about music that degrades women and TVs and movies that show a \"continuous stream of grotesque killing.\"\nHe then turned his anger on Ian Mercer, the shooter's father.\n\"Now, let's get really politically incorrect here and talk specifically about this horror in Oregon. This killer's father is now lecturing us on the need for gun control and he says he has no idea how or where his son got the guns.Of course he doesn't know. You know why he doesn't know? Because he is not, and has never been in his son's life. He's a complete failure as a father, he should be embarrassed to even show his face in public.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-fS9SBLTGk", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-oregon-shooting_56150c18e4b0cf9984d7acd2"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:51:39.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
