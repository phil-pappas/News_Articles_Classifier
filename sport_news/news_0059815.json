Launched in May 2015, Google now reports it has surpassed a big milestone with more than 100 million active monthly users. That’s impressive when you compare it to other services like Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest that all took much longer to reach the same quantity of users.\nGoogle Photos Google Play Page The ease of access to Google Photos has likely helped boost the numbers. The company gives the service away to those with Gmail accounts. Google spun off Google Photos from its Google+ social network back in May.\nAccording to the company, Google Photos was originally started as a way to store an unlimited number of photographs with high quality. In addition, the service offers the ability to quickly search for the photograph you want with automatic organization. Consistently praised for its simplicity, Google Photos combines things from competitors like Apple iCloud, Yahoo Flickr and Dropbox Carousel into just one service.\nGoogle Photos remains the only service that stores unlimited photos. As of yet, there are no solutions from Apple, while Facebook highly compresses its photos. The service provided by Google Photos includes apps available on Android , iOS and the web.\nWith Google Photos users have the ability to not only delete backed up videos and photos on their personal device but also remain with the option of accessing those photos and videos by way of Google Photos. This means you never have to worry about not having enough space left on your phone.\nAs well, Google Photos makes it easy to create collages with just a couple of clicks. All you have to do is select the photos you want, then tap the + button and finally select “collage”. By the same token, if you want to make a GIF all you have to do is select the photos, again tap the + button and this time select “animation”.\nIf you want to search for, say all selfies, you can do that too. As well, if you want to find photographs of your kids you can add their nickname on to a private name label. That’s a key feature considering that, according to Google Photos, babies are at the top of the list when it comes to subjects that users search for. You can also search by season or event, such as “Halloween” or “costumes”.\nAs part of the big announcement concerning the number of Google Photos users there are, Google also announced some of the top searches and top things that users photograph. Right behind photographing other people, users like to photograph food. It comes in second place on a list of what people like to take pictures of. Also high on the list are cars. Dogs are also in a large number of photographs as are mountains, beaches and sky. In addition, many people simply like to search for “me” when using Google Photos.", "external_links": ["https://photos.google.com/"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:19:42.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
