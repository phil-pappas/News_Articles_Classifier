Bouma rushed 20 times for 94 yards in the game and had two receptions for 80 yards. \nCoyotes coach Joe Glenn says Bouma is scheduled for surgery on the broken arm — the same one he broke a year ago that cut his season five games short. He'll miss the final five games again this year. \nBouma was leading the Missouri Valley Football Conference in yards per carry and was the league's fifth-leading rusher. \nThe game also was costly for NDSU, which has lost starting quarterback Carson Wentz to a broken wrist. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:29:38.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
