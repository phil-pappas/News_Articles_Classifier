Parenteau scored and Jonathan Bernier made 34 saves as the Maple Leafs fell to 1-3-2. \nBuffalo got off to a fast start, but it was Parenteau who opened the scoring when he redirected Roman Polak's shot from the right point over Johnson's shoulder at the 1:28 mark. \nKane pushed a wrister past Bernier on Buffalo's 33rd shot of the night. Buffalo acquired Kane from Winnipeg in February, but he was unable to play until this season after having shoulder surgery. \nThe game went to 3-on-3 overtime, where Buffalo quickly had a 3-on-1 foiled by Bernier. \nJohnson made an acrobatic left pad save to stop Kadri deep into overtime, and Toronto missed two further chances to score. \nIn the first, Kane picked up a loose puck to spring a 2-on-1 with rookie Jack Eichel, but elected to make a pass that was pushed away from danger. \nThe pair was responsible for much of the Sabres' attack, with 13 of Buffalo's 35 shots on goal. \nBernier made a point blank stop on Matt Moulson during a Buffalo power play about nine minutes into the period, and then denied Kane moments later. \nOff Tyler Ennis' takeaway at the blue line, Nicolas Deslauriers put a shot past Bernier but off the cross bar. \nBuffalo finished the first with a 12-6 advantage in shots. \nToronto took eight of the first nine second-period shots, but Buffalo started to find its form with Nick Spaling in the box for interfering with Johnson. \nBernier was called into action for five shots on the power play, including a pair of scrums near his crease. \nBuffalo took control of the third period midway through and raised the Leafs' ire when Kane plowed through Dion Phaneuf near the blue line, dropping Toronto's captain to the ice with a high stick. \nEnnis and Cody Franson each had chances to beat Bernier during a possession with about six minutes left, but the Toronto goaltender saved both. \nNOTES: Toronto out shot Buffalo 3-1 in overtime. ... The Sabres placed D Bobby Sanguinetti on waivers earlier Wednesday. ... Toronto's Jake Gardiner missed the game with a minor injury. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:54:52.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
