Bickell signed a four-year, $16 million contract after helping Chicago win the Stanley Cup championship in 2013. \nHis production dropped off last year when he finished with 14 goals and 28 points in 80 games. Bickell experienced vertigo, which forced him to miss most of Chicago's Stanley Cup final series against Tampa Bay.
