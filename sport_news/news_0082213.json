For the most part, the team has had a healthy roster coming out of the bye as no one missed a practice leading up to this Week Five matchup with the Dallas Cowboys. But that doesn’t mean everyone will be available on Sunday. The Pats had three limited players on Thursday – Tarell Brown (foot), Bradley Fletcher (hamstring), and Trey Flowers (knee/shoulder) – and we’ll get a better idea of who will play over the next day or so. The team will issue a practice reporter later this evening and can downgrade players on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:56:37.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
