The Pirates came storming out, and before you knew it, there were 50 players screaming and yelling at one another in the middle of the biggest game of their lives. \nThe Cubs thought it was a bush-league move, and veteran pitcher Dan Haren didn’t hesitate calling out the Pirates. \n\"If anything, they looked stupid at the end of it,\" Haren said. \"I mean, we were all jacked up already. I don’t think we needed any more help. Jake took it like a man. \n\"Pittsburgh just looked really bad. \n\"Obviously, they get beat, and then throwing at the starting pitcher, I don’t think I’ve ever seen that.\" \nArrieta, now more angry than ever, personally made sure the Pirates looked foolish, becoming the first Cubs pitcher to throw a postseason shutout in 70 years, leading the Cubs to a 4-0 victory and a date on Friday night with their bitter rivals — the St. Louis Cardinals. \n\"What fired me up,\" Arrieta said, \"was seeing all my teammates behind me. It’s a situation where you don’t want to see anybody get hurt. Obviously, I’m not trying to hurt their guys. \n\"It’s the playoffs. There’s a lot at stake. Tempers are running hot. It’s just the environment. It breeds that kind of intensity, and sometimes those things happen.\" \nAnd sometimes, things start happening that can turn a franchise from lovable losers into an awfully dangerous team. \n\"This is Arrieta’s year,\" Pirates catcher Francisco Cervelli said. \"And I believe we just faced the team that will be in the World Series. \n\"They’re really good.\" For Pirates, another quick October exit 'hard to take' \nThe Cubs won their first postseason game since 2003, and after playing one another for 112 years, they’ll be playing the Cardinals for the first time in the postseason. \n\"I love it. I don’t just like it, I love it,\" said Cubs manager Joe Maddon, who grew up a Cardinals fan. \"I know their fans are amazing. They understand the game. They have this wonderful tradition. To go there and play them, it’s almost a privilege. An honor. \n\"Our guys, they’re just babies, and now they get to play them. They could be playing at Double-A or Triple-A for some organizations, and look at them. \n\"It’s just tremendous what they’ve done so far.\" \nThe Cubs kiddie corps may be barely old enough to drink, but after watching their wild celebration roll well past midnight, they learned in a hurry how to uncork bottles of champagne. They ripped through cases of Korbel and Royal Cuvee, dousing one another with hundreds of bottles of beer, and making sure it would be the greatest party of their lives. Cubs rookie Kyle Schwarber blasts home run literally out of PNC Park \nIt’s almost unfathomable to imagine just how crazy this can get if they keep this up for the next month, culminating in their first World Series championship since 1908. \n\"It wouldn’t have felt right not to go home with this team,\" says Cubs president Theo Epstein, completely drenched, watching his team grow up before his very eyes. \"We’ve had a little bit of magic going on all year long. We deserve a nice little run here in October.\" \nWell, Arrieta personally made sure the Cubs will be heading straight to St. Louis, and not home for the cold winter. \nWhen Cubs rookie right fielder Kyle Schwarber drove in a run in the first inning, the Cubs believed the game was over. When Schwarber hit a towering two-run homer that landed in the Allegheny River in the third inning, the 3-0 lead looked like an absolute rout. The Pirates could have brought boat paddles up to the plate, and it wouldn’t have made a difference. \nThis is a guy who has now pitched 29 consecutive scoreless innings, yielding just nine hits, one walk and 36 strikeouts. He has given up a grand total of four runs the last two months. His 0.41 ERA since the end of July was the lowest by any pitcher since the stat was even created.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:22:31.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
