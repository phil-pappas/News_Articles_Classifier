Singal's new program, in which he reveals his strategies for scaling a digital publishing business opened for enrollment today, and marketers around the Internet are weighing in with reviews.\n\"Considering the fairly high number of courses out there on this topic of digital publishing, one might be surprised by the commotion surrounding the launch of Publish Academy,\" says HonestyFirstReviews.com's Tiffany Hendricks. \"However, following the huge success of Singal's previous training programs Inbox Blueprint and Profit Academy, I had a sneaking suspicion that this was going to be 2015's biggest Internet marketing product launch.\"\nIn Hendricks' review she provides a detailed overview of the course material including a breakdown of the numerous video training modules. Hendricks also provides her own personal opinion on the quality of the training, and the value that the course offers to the market.\n\"While the digital publisher business model can be extremely rewarding it also has its drawbacks,\" reports Hendricks. \"One of the biggest problems marketers face is the sense of overwhelm that can set in when they see just how many moving parts there are to deal with. The great thing about Publish Academy is that it gives marketers a step-by-step road-map that they can follow. Not only do Anik's students get an over-the-shoulder look at what goes into scaling a digital publishing business, but they also get a level of support and hand-holding that goes beyond anything that I have ever heard of. In addition to weekly training webinars where students can get ongoing support and instruction, Publish Academy is also providing daily Q & A webinars in multiple time zones.\"\nEnrollment in Publish Academy is now open via Singal's website. Those wishing to enroll can get access here .\nTiffany Hendricks provides reviews of the latest Internet marketing courses, software and digital training programs on her website HonestyFirstReviews.com.
