The term \"must-win\" game is overused in describing sporting events. This is essentially a must-win game if the Tide want to remain in the national championship picture. For Georgia, this would be a statement win over one of the top teams in the country that would provide further proof that the Bulldogs have the talent to compete for a national title. \nThree things to look for: \n1. Weather. Heavy rain is in the forecast — which could make for an ugly, sloppy game with both teams even more dependent than usual on their respective running games. National Weather Service meteorologist Ryan Willis told AL.com's Michael Casagrande that 2-3 inches of rain or more is in the forecast. Willis said conditions \"could get pretty messy.\" That could be an advantage for Alabama, which is fourth nationally in rush defense. \n2. Alabama's offensive line. The line has been solid in the run game in the two biggest games of the season, clearing the way for the Tide to rush for 238 yards and four touchdowns vs. Wisconsin and 215 yards and two scores against Ole Miss. However, the play of the group as a whole has been just OK. Alabama is tied for 93 rd nationally in tackles for a loss allowed per game (6.75). While the Tide are tied for a respectable 38 th in sacks allowed, they gave up two sacks against Louisiana Monroe last week and have surrendered a combined 16 quarterback hurries the last three weeks despite two of the games (Middle Tennessee and Louisiana Monroe) being against non-Power Five conference teams. Alabama will now have to slow down a fast, athletic defensive front with two of the top pass rushers in the SEC — Leonard Floyd and Jordan Jenkins. \n3. Nick Chubb and Derrick Henry. Georgia's Chubb and Alabama's Henry are two of the top running backs in the country. How productive each can be will likely go a long way in determining the outcome of the game, especially if the weather is bad. Chubb and Henry are both legitimate contenders for the Heisman Trophy as well as All-SEC and All-American honors. \nKey matchup: \nGeorgia's running game vs. Alabama's defensive front. Georgia has one of the top running games in the country. Behind running backs Chubb and Sony Michel and a physical offensive lineman, the Bulldogs have run for 258 yards per game and are fourth nationally in yards per carry (6.87). However, Alabama may be the team most equipped to slow down that running game. The Tide are fourth nationally in rush defense, allowing just 56.75 yards per game. Alabama is third in yards per carry allowed (1.97). Limiting Georgia on the ground would make the Bulldogs more dependent on transfer quarterback Greyson Lambert. That would be an ideal scenario for the Tide, especially with heavy rain in the forecast. \nBy the numbers: \n8.4 — Chubb is averaging 8.4 yards per carry, the second-highest average in the country among running back with at least 55 carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:26:12.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
