Dramatic. Suspenseful. That's how one might describe the weekend for Bismarck High's soccer team during their state championship run. \nIn the semifinals against Fargo South, the Bruins tied it up with 4 minutes to go. The Demons thought their dreams might be over. But then they came back to win in an epic shootout. \nIn the championship against Shanley, the Demons were down 1-0 with five minutes to go. Again, a loss in sight. Then... they scored. And from that point on, they knew this tournament was theirs for the taking. \n\"Once Hunter got behind their back line and put one away, it was kinda 'all right, let's go. We're back in this!'\" says head coach, Andy Foss. \nBismarck goalie Derek Wachter says, \"I'm just glad we found some heart. But, for a second there, I was actually thinking of a way to tell my team I'm sorry for the let down.\" \nIn those dramatic shootouts, Bismarck's opponents missed a combined 5 penalties. The Demons... missed zero. And Wachter made 3 saves. \n\"In a shootout like that, I guess, I really just told myself, 'I'm going this way or that way.'\" Wachter says. \n\"Derek was phenomenal and he made a couple of great saves that sent us to the ship and got us the ship,\" says Michael Hertz, who scored 2 PKs over the weekend. \nAnd for those chosen to take one of the five PKs, the mindset in that one on one moment was the exact same. \nHertz says, \"I got my homework done... I practiced it earlier. I'm feeling good and I knew I'd put it away.\" \nAnd put it away they did. After an excruciating 24 hours and an 18 year titleless drought, the Bismarck Demons could finally hold up the trophy. \nWachter says, \"I just felt like a champion, I guess. I mean, I worked all four years to be in that moment... to win one. It's just really something, I can't tell ya.\" \n\"We knew we were the best team in the West,\" says Hertz. \"We figured we were the best team in the state with the guys we had and how hard we were working in practice. We were just happy it all paid off.\" \nFoss says, \"I really couldn't ask for a better group of guys to be the ones that break the streak and end the drought for us. It's really all you could ask for as a coach.\" \nMatt Dowell, KX Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:59:21.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
