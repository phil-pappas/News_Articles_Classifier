East versus West. It’s been a long time coming,” Appleton said. \nEuropean and American champions will go up against Asia’s champions from Nov. 19 to 21 in what surely will become the most epic rivalry in cue sports. \n“The pool world is about to get rocked in a war that fans have been dreaming about for years,” said Dragon Promotions executive producer Charlie Williams, himself a mean pool player. \nImmonen welcomed Appleton, saying: “Darren is obviously an amazing player and amazing team player. We get along really great and have a tremendous amount of mutual respect for one another.” \n“Darren has had the most international wins in majors than any professional player in the past 9 years. And with his titles in multiple disciplines in the World 14.1, One Pocket, and Chinese 8-Ball, he stands above even other European and Americans. So he was an obvious choice for the team,” Williams said. \nThe format of the Kings Cup will follow in the footsteps of the successful Queens Cup. Teams will play in versatile styles including singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples each of the three days of the men’s competition. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:23:53.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
