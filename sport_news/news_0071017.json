It's not too much to expect a boost of energy from the coaching change. Plus, the Titans at 1-3 are a good opponent to change your season. \n\nDolphins Writer/Columnist Prediction: Titans 24, Dolphins 17 Comment: The Titans, who have one of the NFL’s top five defenses, will stack the box, daring Ryan Tannehill to throw aggressive passes. Tennessee will follow the same blueprint as the Bills and the Jets had in shutting down the Dolphins. This team is going nowhere until Tannehill’s 6.32 yards per attempt average gets closer to the league average (7.3). If interim coach Dan Campbell wants his team to become aggressive, the quarterback needs to be the beacon of change. \n\nDolphins Writer Prediction: Dolphins 17, Titans 14 Comment: Admittedly, I’ve lost the feel for this team. Last week, I said I didn’t think they were bad enough to fall to 1-3. I’ll keep using that logic until they win, as they have the talent. \n\nSports Editor Prediction: Dolphins 24, Titans 20 Comment: Two key questions: If the Dolphins win, do they carry Dan Campbell off the field? And if so, are they strong enough to lift him? Kidding aside, the Dolphins should play with a little more edge this Sunday -- and the bye week will have them fresh enough to take advantage of it. \n\nOnline Sports Editor Prediction: Titans 20, Dolphins 16 Comment: How realistic is it to expect things to turn around quickly under interim coach Dan Campbell? In the last two games, Ryan Tannehill has a a woeful 56.5 passer rating and has thrown five interceptions. To make matters worse, the Dolphins have yet to recover an opposing fumble, and are tied for second worst in the NFL with three takeaways. As for the Titans, they have the league's stingiest passing defense, allowing just 166.5 yards per game. \nMultimedia Reporter Prediction: Dolphins 22, Titans 17 Comment: The Dolphins, along with a new level of intensity naturally born from a coaching change, should be strengthened by the returns of Branden Albert and Brent Grimes, along with a more healthy Cameron Wake. The pass rush must show up against a Titans team that is playing its third home game in a row, with the first two being losses as rookie Marcus Mariota's passer rating has declined each week. Lamar Miller needs at least 18 touches. \nCBS12 Sports Director Prediction: Dolphins 20, Titans 17 Comment: While Marcus Mariota has been decent in his rookie season, Tennessee has seen moderate success this year mostly because of an improved defense (they lead the league in pass defense). This is finally the game the Dolphins dedicate themselves to the run -- and they get a win because of it. \n\nHow do you think the Dolphins will fare this week?
