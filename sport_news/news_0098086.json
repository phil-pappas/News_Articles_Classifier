Johny Hendricks not making weight was a loss for him and a victory for me. He was not prepared to fight, I was,\" Woodley said. \"I had already made weight and was ready to fight. This was not the first time he has had trouble making weight, but it is part of being a professional.\"\nHendricks' manager told MMAFighting.com the fighter suffered a blockage in his intestine and a kidney stone. He was out of the hospital on Friday morning.\nHendricks had told reporters during a media session on Thursday that he was 183 pounds and on track to make the 171-pound limit byFriday's weigh-in.\nThe winner of the welterweight bout, which had been slated as the co-main event on the card, was thought to be in line for a potential title shot.\nWoodley believes he has earned that right.\n\"I should not be penalized for not being able to compete,\" he said. \"I am ready to fight for a title and believe that I deserve it.\"\nA flyweight bout between Joseph Benavidez and Ali Bagautinov has been moved from the preliminary card to the main card to fill the spot on the pay-per-view broadcast, which begins at 7 p.m.\nContact reporter Adam Hill at ahill@reviewjournal.com or 702-224-5509 .
