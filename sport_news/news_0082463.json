Under-23 coach Andreas Herzog’s lofty expectations, laid out in a pre-tournament conference call with reporters, have been almost entirely fulfilled.\n“I expect my team to have good control of the game, dictate the rhythm of the game—especially in midfield—[and] create some chances,” Herzog said on Sept. 30. “We have some quality players. We have pace and speed up front, so I expect a lot.”\nThe U.S. followed a relatively narrow 3-1 win over Canada with 6-1 and 4-0 victories over Cuba and Panama, respectively, to set up a semifinal against Honduras on Saturday for an automatic spot at Rio 2016. Mexico beat Los Catrachos 2-1 on Wednesday and will take on Canada in the other must-win game before the winners meet in the final for, essentially, bragging rights. The semifinal losers, meanwhile, play for the chance to face Colombia in an intercontinental playoff for one final spot in the Olympics.\nForwards Jordan Morris and Jerome Kiesewetter have led the way for the U.S. with a tournament-leading three goals apiece. They and captain Luis Gil added two assists each in a dominant group stage showing.\nPlanet Futbol Jordan Morris, Jerome Kiesewetter spark USA’s shutout over Panama by Liviu Bird", "external_links": ["http://facebook.com/liviubird", "http://twitter.com/liviubird"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:41:41.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
