We must warn you that she is self-conscious about the injuries to her face. However, she wants to show other kids what she looks like so they pay more attention when crossing a street.\n14-year-old Samantha Morehart of Tiffin carefully moves on crutches as she returns for the first time to the spot where she was hit by a car while walking to school one day ago.\n\"I know a lot of high schoolers take the route that I take,” says Samantha.\nIt’s her so-called “shortcut.”\nSouth Sandusky Street at Leitner Avenue.\n\"I shouldn't have run in front of that car,” says Samantha.\nMorehart says Wednesday started like every other morning, until she crossed the street and ended up being flown by helicopter to a hospital in Toledo.\n\"My brother, he was walking ahead of me and a car slowed down when he cross so I figured it would be OK for me to go,” says Samantha. “I was listening to my music and stuff. I was paying attention to the car, but I didn't realize it sped up after Jeff ran.\"\n\"Thank God it wasn't a semi,” says Susan Morehart, Samantha’s mother. “53 is a busy highway.\"\n\"She was crossing the street in an area she shouldn't have been,” says Sgt. Robert Bour with the Tiffin Police Department.\nSgt. Bour says Samantha was jaywalking.\nThe driver, 44-year-old Beth Amos, told police she had been driving up the hill about 40 miles per hour.\n\"There will be no charges against the driver,” says Sgt. Bour. “She was in the right-of-way at the time.\"\n\"I don't blame anybody for it,” says Samantha. “I really don't. It's not her fault.\"\nSamatha’s mother says yellow signs are along the side of the road, although no crosswalk and it was dark.\n\"If this is a bike/walk trail, why isn't there more lighting?\" says Susan Morehart.\nSamantha is now nursing a fractured pelvis, a fracture on her face, a laceration on her forehead, and bruises all over her body.\nAfter what she has been through, the teen has advice for other kids who like to listen to music on the walk to school.\n\"Use a speaker, not earbuds,” says Samantha.\nAccording to Samantha's family, the doctors say her fractures will heal on their own. Meanwhile, mom plans to keep her home from school so she can rest for about a week.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Samantha+Morehart1.JPG", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E6D/0A9/E6D0A96513A24B5683F204B3B5DC864A.mp4", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/Samantha+Morehart1.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:06:29.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
