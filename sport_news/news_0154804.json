NBA LaVine to start for Minnesota \nZach LaVine, a Bothell High School graduate, has gone from league slam-dunk champion as a rookie to starting shooting guard for the Minnesota Timberwolves before his second pro season. \nInterim coach Sam Mitchell named LaVine, 20, the starter Wednesday, before the Wolves played their first exhibition game. \nMitchell said he made the decision with an eye toward the long-term health of the franchise, not the immediate future. \n“It’s not necessarily about earning (the spot),” Mitchell said. “It’s about where you are as an organization and where you’re trying to go.” Most Read Stories \nLaVine got the nod over Kevin Martin, 32. \n“I feel like I proved myself throughout training camp,” LaVine said. \nLaVine scored eight points on 2-for-11 shooting in Wednesday’s 122-99 loss to Oklahoma City. \nThunder superstar Kevin Durant, who had not played in a game since Feb. 19 because of a broken right foot, had 15 points in 22 minutes.

Hall of Famer Gallatin dies at 88 \nHarry Gallatin, a Hall of Famer who was a seven-time All-Star forward for the New York Knicks in the 1950s, died Wednesday in Edwardsville, Ill.

WNBA Intensity increases in Finals \nIndiana forward Tamika Catchings was still shaking about 30 minutes after the Fever dropped a tense Game 2 of the best-of-five WNBA Finals to the Minnesota Lynx. \nCatchings was limited to 24 minutes in the 77-71 loss on Tuesday because of foul trouble, and steam was practically coming out of her ears as she talked about letting her team down and gearing up for Game 3 on Friday in Indiana. The teams split two games in Minneapolis. \n“We told our team we are going to bottle up every sense of frustration, every sense of anger, every sense of knowing what we didn’t accomplish tonight,” Catchings said. “Put that in a bottle and let it explode when we get back home.” \nMinnesota standout Maya Moore said, “After the horn blew, both teams were still wanting to go. We’re ready to go for Game 3.” College football S. Carolina moves game to LSU \nSouth Carolina is moving Saturday’s scheduled home game against the Louisiana State Tigers to Baton Rouge, La., because of massive flooding around the university. \nSaturday’s game at LSU will start at 12:30 p.m. Pacific time. \nLSU officials will give South Carolina all proceeds from the game after they pay expenses. The Gamecocks will be treated as the home team in almost every way, LSU athletic director Joe Alleva said. \n“We will be playing their music,” Alleva said. “We will play some of their fight songs. We will play their alma mater.” \nGamecocks AD Ray Tanner said even with the money from LSU, South Carolina will take a loss. Bevo XIV won’t travel to game \nUniversity of Texas officials say the Longhorns’ steer mascot, Bevo XIV, has a “life-threatening condition” and won’t travel to Dallas for the team’s game Saturday against 10th-ranked Oklahoma at the Cotton Bowl. \nBevo XIV, who weighs about 2,100 pounds, has been Texas’ mascot since 2004. Soccer Blatter might be suspended \nSepp Blatter could be facing a 90-day suspension. The FIFA president’s future was being determined by the governing body’s ethics committee at meetings in Zurich, Switzerland, with Blatter at risk of being suspended after a criminal case was opened against him. \nBlatter associate Klaus Stoehlker, who has no role at FIFA, told The Associated Press and other media outlets the ethics committee’s adjudicatory chamber recommended a 90-day suspension for the sport’s most powerful official. \n“Blatter has heard that from several sources,” Stoehlker said. “He has not got any message from the committee … and he is perfectly under control. He is going to the office tomorrow.” \nBlatter has said he plans to stay in his role until a Feb. 26 election; he is not a candidate. \nFIFA presidential contender Chung Mong-joon, in a speech in London, called Blatter a “hypocrite and a liar” and said he is planning to sue him for at least $100 million. Chung said Blatter should pay for the damage he has caused FIFA.
