Picture: Peter Wallis\nBERNIE PRAMBERG The Courier-Mail A CRICKETER’S life is splendid freedom, healthy effort, endless variety and delightful good fellowship. So said W.G. Grace.\nThose words uttered by the father of cricket might be the mantra echoing around Allan Border Field on Thursday (Oct 22) when Australia play England in the opening ODI Test of the over-70s Ashes series.\nThat’s right. Over-70s cricket at international level.\nRoss Chapman, a former Brisbane first-grader with Norths and Colts, is the Australian skipper after being vice-captain of the national over-60s on three overseas tours.\nChapman, from Gympie, turned 70 in June and is one of the “youngsters” in the Australia side.\nAlthough seniors cricket has long been established in England it is relatively new in Australia and is now the fastest-growing area of the game.\nRoss Chapman, captain of the over 70s Australian cricket team to play England. Picture Peter Wallis Source: News Corp Australia\n“When we first started over-60s cricket we struggled to get enough players for a state team and thought it would just be a bit of fun,’’ Chapman said.\n“Suddenly the whole concept took off and we had cricketers coming out of the woodwork. My first year was 2009 and the growth since then has been quite remarkable.’’\nQueensland did not field an over-70s team at the national championships until 2013 they won the title the following year.\nThe 2015 Ashes series will be contested over three ODI Tests (Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra) with another six tour matches to be played.\nEngland will open their tour against a Queensland City line-up tomorrow at Benowa on the Gold Coast and former Australian fast bowler Geoff Dymock will captain Queensland Country against the tourists at Caloundra on Tuesday.\n“Being involved in these games is a wonderful experience,’’ Chapman said. “I’ve been to England twice, New Zealand and South Africa with Australian teams and they are a terrific group of fellows who you will know for the rest of your life.\nRoss Chapman, captain of the over 70s Australian cricket team to play England. Picture: Peter Wallis Source: News Corp Australia\n“There’s something about cricket no matter at what age you play the game. There is always a lot of repartee and it doesn’t change much over the years.’’\nKerry Emery, president of Queensland Seniors Cricket, said numerous former cricketers had rekindled their passion for the game by returning as players.\n“As well, there is the camaraderie and friendships which are generated,’’ he said. “We see a lot of positive results from involvement in seniors cricket.\n“It is a highlight for the Australian over-70s to get the opportunity to play a series against England and we extend a warm welcome to our visitors, their partners and supporters for the first ODI to be played on Queensland soil.’’\nA glance through the biographies of players reveals lifelong involvement in the game as players, administrators and umpires as well as some notable achievements on other sports.\nAustralia’s keeper for the opening Test, Noel Cox, still plays fourth grade club cricket on the Sunshine Coast and was a tough-tackling second-rower in Redcliffe’s first rugby league premiership in reserve grade in 1964.\nRoss Chapman, captain of the over 70s Australian cricket team to play England. Picture: Peter Wallis Source: News Corp Australia\nQueenslanders in the team include opening batsman Nev Kratzmann, a farmer from Windera near Murgon, and Gary Madsen who is a life member of Queensland Cricket and a tireless worker for country cricket.\nKratzmann played for South Queensland Country against Mike Denness’s touring England team in 1976 while Madsen is a handy batsman who bowls tidy medium-pacers.\nThe England captain is Hugh Milner, a right-arm swing bowler and lower-order batsman, while wicketkeeper Jeff Baxter has played cricket every summer since 1953.\nMedium-pacer Jim Phillips was a tad quicker in his youth, opening the bowling with John Snow at college and claiming the wicket of Mike Brearley in both innings of a minor countries match.\nAnother medium-pacer, Welshman Ron Walton, was a football coach at Swansea City FC for more than 20 years.\nAnd the Poms have their own mini-Barmy Army organised by supporter Frank Winrow who describes himself as an avid supporter of Lancashire County Cricket Club, Southport FC and “a beer-drinking TV sports enthusiast”.\nChapman anticipates a closely fought three-match series.\n“I know quite a few of the English players and the games will be played very competitively, but in great spirit,’’ he said.\n Ross ready to take on ‘old enemy’", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b65668dd16efae276af7ee12dd4f7ae8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f4db74e404dbb8bc79a2e826a4354fb9", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/love-of-the-game-australian-over-70s-cricketers-take-onnbspengland/story-fnii08h4-1227574036363", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/082e5d23deba10a48865fc0c24a81ef8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/30c3f413be88f56b78f4f48f75a6eec8", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:29:44.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
