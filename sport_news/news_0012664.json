The Sri Lankan also managed to maintain the position to come in third.\nHowever, with the race winner Afiq from Malaysia not classified as he drove without a partner, Armaan and Dilantha were placed second which fetched the pair 12 crucial points that put them third in the championship, just four adrift of the second spot and nine behind the leader.\nArmaan had a good run in the qualifying session as he put in his fastest lap and looked set to improve in the next loop, but ran into traffic.\nArmaan made a good start in the race to keep pace with the front runners while opening a sizeable gap to the car behind him. After the change-over, Dilantha was under pressure and lost a place, but recovered well to regain the position.\nReflecting on his performance, Armaan said, \"In the first qualifying session which decides where we start in the first race, I did my fastest lap on my first flyer. The next lap should have been the lap, but I was blocked. Nevertheless, I was happy with P3, just three-tenths off the pace.\n\"The race start was ok. I ran through with the leaders and opened a gap to the guy in fourth. After the pit stop, Dilantha was under some pressure and actually lost a place, but did well to fight back and regain the position.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:37:38.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
