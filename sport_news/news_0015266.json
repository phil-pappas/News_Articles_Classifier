Only Joey Logano — with wins at Charlotte and Kansas — is guaranteed a slot in the next round. \n“It’s going to be a crazy deal at the end,” said Martin Truex Jr., one of 11 drivers vying for the remaining seven slots. “We’re going to race hard and not worry about where we’re at throughout the day because we know how it can be there. \n“There are chances you have to be willing to take sometimes. Obviously, there’s a few guys that seem to be always able to make the right decision. A lot of it depends on what the guys around you do. You have to kind of go with your intuition on that and think, ‘What is this guy going to do? What is that guy going to do?’ ” \nThe uniqueness of this stop on the Chase carousel — six races into the 10 that make up the title run — can be seen in official actions that came before teams roll into eastern Alabama. \nFirst, drivers will see a speedway racing corridor completely cloaked in SAFER barriers. Track officials say they have added 8,000 linear feet of the so-called “soft” walls, putting the barriers in front of every foot of outside and inside wall in the facility. \nIn addition, NASCAR announced Tuesday a significant procedural change for its weekend races at the 2.66-mile, high-speed track. Although standard procedure calls for up to three green-white-checkered restarts to end a race if caution flags slow the field, this weekend’s races will be lengthened by only one attempt — if necessary. \nThe change is a nod toward safety – two-lap green-flag race-ending runs at Talladega and Daytona are filled with potential for mayhem. It’s an admission by NASCAR that repeated attempts at “GWC” finishes at the tracks often lead to huge crashes and increase the chances of drivers or fans being injured. Dillon and five fans in the frontstretch grandstand near where his car went into the catchfence suffered minor injuries. \n“We take very seriously the responsibility of balancing exciting finishes and safety,” said NASCAR executive vice president Steve O’Donnell. “We’re confident that this is a positive direction for both.” \nDrivers generally favor the change, although it’s curious that the sanctioning body, in citing safety, chose to leave one GWC finish in place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:13:13.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
