He retired in 2013 after 11 seasons in the league and 71 games with the Bengals. He'll dive into the game film every week to provide his unique insight into what the Bengals are doing right and wrong as the season progresses. \nThis week, Chris Crocker jumps into the film room to look at three plays which ended up in wide open deep touchdown passes for the the opponent. The first came in Week 2 against San Diego, second in Week 5 against Seattle and third last week at Buffalo. \nAs for if there's reason for concern over the repeated breakdowns in the secondary allowing for uncontested touchdowns, Crocker was hesitant to go that far. \n\"I don't really think that's an issue. Really the biggest problem in my opinion is we played a lot of zone coverage. We really haven't been aggressive and played a lot of man to man. The reason being we've been ahead a lot of games so we've been able to keep the balls in front of us and let the quarterback dink and dunk. In the same sense, we are not going to be able to do that come later in the season if the game doesn't dictate that when it's a really tight ballgame and we have to get up in these receivers faces then we've got to play man coverage. When you go into the bye week that's really the issue that's really a concern and what these coaches should be looking at is really allowing these young defensive backs to really, really hone their skills.\" \nCrocker goes on to point out Dre Kirkpatrick found himself in the middle of each of the first two busted coverages and the third falls more on the defensive line for allowing E.J. Manuel to get out of the pocket to give extra time for Sammy Watkins to break free. \n\"When you play a lot of zone coverage sometimes these things happen. The one play we allow the quarterback to get out of the pocket and extend the play. Sometimes it happens, but I really wouldn't be concerned at all.\" \nAs for how the defense has been playing as a whole this year, Crocker discards ranking 26th in yards per play and sides more toward ranking 9th in total points allowed per game. \n\"The defense has been playing outstanding, believe it or not. When you look at the front four the pass rush they've been able to generate, how those guys have played, it's been exciting to watch this defense. The challenge this season isn't going to be how they play when they are ahead, the challenge is going to be how they play when they have the tight ballgames when the offense isn't scoring points after points after points.\" 24 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1RZt0Sm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:22:31.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
