He was removed from life support a few days later on Saturday night at San Jose Regional Medical Center. Harryman was a member of the San Jose State Men's Water Polo Club, which is separate from the university's intercollegiate water polo team. \nHarris said Harryman probably was swimming laps with other water polo players shortly after 6 p.m. He did not hit his head by falling on the deck or diving into the pool, she said. \nHarris said campus lifeguards applied a cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedure and an automated external defibrillator, or AED, a medical emergency device. The lifeguards were followed by university police officers and emergency medical technicians, who transported him to Regional Medical Center. Members of the Sunnyvale-based Harryman family were at his side when he died. \nHis brother, William Harryman, described Ryan over the weekend as an engaging and multitalented young man who also enjoyed writing, music and delivering comedy sketches live and on film. A competitive swimmer since age 4, Harryman also had played water polo for Homestead High School in Cupertino.

Harris said a memorial service for Harryman could be announced the same day.
