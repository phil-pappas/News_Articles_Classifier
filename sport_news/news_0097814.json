After losing the first two sets, the Lady Hoyas rallied back — staving off match point in the fourth set — to stun Lassiter in an all-Cobb showdown. Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow KENNESAW — Harrison was granted a new lease on life, and it took full advantage of it.With Lassiter ahead two sets to one and on a 24-23 match point in the fourth, Harrison’s Abby Moss hit an attack that landed just beyond the baseline. As Lassiter’s players began to celebrate and Harrison accepted an apparent defeat, things changed when Lassiter was whistled for touching the net.From there, the Lady Hoyas gave up just four points for the rest of the match, completing a stunning rally to win 21-25, 16-25, 25-17, 26-24, 15-4 on Tuesday in the second round of the Class state tournament.It was the third straight match Harrison won after coming from behind. The Lady Hoyas rallied from a 23-14 first-set deficit to beat North Cobb in straight sets to win the Area 4 title, then came back from a set down to beat Alpharetta in the first round last week. “We knew we could come back from any set after that North Cobb match, no matter what the score was,” Harrison assistant coach Rob Cowart said. “There’s playing time and there’s winning time, and our girls stepped up and played like stars during winning time.”Harrison (31-10) will learn its opponent for Saturday’s quarterfinal after the Georgia High School Association reseeds the final eight teams today.The Lady Hoyas were ahead 21-19 in the fourth set when top hitter Katie Doering was rotated out of the match. With Doering on the bench, Lassiter (29-9) tied the score at 22-all on a combined block by Alexus Holt and Ella Muetterties and Libby Bochniak’s kill. Another combined block by Bochniak and Holt gave the Lady Trojans a 23-22 lead and, after Harrison tied it on a double-hit call against Lassiter, Kaylee McClure hit a serve out of bounds to set up Lassiter’s match point.After Lassiter’s fateful error for touching the net, Doering re-entered the game.With its leader back on the floor, Harrison was a different team. Riley Fischer hit a kill to set up set point for Harrison, and Doering was in on a block alongside Allana McInnis that sent the match to a decisive set. Lassiter committed five unforced errors over the first eight points to start the fifth set, spotting Harrison an early 7-1 lead. Most of the Lady Trojans’ errors came after long points in which Harrison thwarted numerous Lassiter attacks and blocks.Harrison went on to take an 11-1 lead on back-to-back Fischer aces, another Lassiter hitting error and a Doering kill. Doering added another smash, followed by a solo block by Moss, to stretch the Lady Hoyas’ lead to 13-2.“One we got that lead, we knew we had to finish, no matter what,” said McInnis, who ended up with eight assists, five kills, an ace and a block-assist. “That was our end goal. We had to finish.”Lassiter coach Greg Hodge said his team’s fifth-set collapse had nothing to do with the call that went against the Lady Trojans on match point in the fourth. “(Harrison is) a scrappy defensive team, and they kept the ball in the air,” Hodge said. “We were trying to be too cute and, unfortunately, you make errors when you try to be too precise.”Doering led Harrison with 20 kills and 3½ blocks. Fischer added eight kills and two aces, while Moss contributed with six kills. Kaylee Morris finished with 33 assists. Lassiter was the more aggressive serving team, with eight aces. Holt, Kate Gordon and Bochniak served two each. The Lady Trojans pulled away in the second set when Holt served out a nine-point run for an 11-2 lead. Bochniak led Lassiter with 23 kills and added two blocks. Micah Ensor had seven kills, two solo blocks and two block-assists, while Holt added four kills and was in on five blocks. Gordon finished with 33 assists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:10:47.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
