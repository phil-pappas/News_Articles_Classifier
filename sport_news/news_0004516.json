Could Back to the Future be right?? https://t.co/qMY7Fnon1V — Paddy Power (@paddypower) October 14, 2015 Cubs fans have been aware of this throughout the 2015 playoffs Is this guy wearing a back to the future 2 coat? #Cubs pic.twitter.com/bp0ZxC5pNH — Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) October 21, 2015 Non-Cubs fans think it's pretty funny, though All over America people who have been Cubs fans for literally weeks are heartbroken; their Lakers and Cowboys are struggling too. Tough. If the Mets win their 4th game Wednesday night, the Cubs storyline from 'Back to the Future' will still be technically true Back To The Future accurately foretold that the Cubs' season would end on October 21, 2015. — Adam Høyer (@AdamHoyer) October 21, 2015 But don't get too cocky, New Yorkers. There's a 'Back to the Future' prediction that's relevant to you, too Back to the Future correctly predicted both the Cubs winning the World Series and Biff Tannen winning the Republican nomination — James Hell Brooks (@BobbyBigWheel) October 17, 2015 Yes, the current GOP Presidential front-runner was a model for the villain of the 1989 movie. Back to the Future II writer Bob Gale: Biff Tannen was based on Donald Trump.No joke. https://t.co/UpMFAToeFg pic.twitter.com/kGvrFxhxxc — Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) October 21, 2015 \nIn \"Back to the Future 2,\" villain Biff Tannen buys his way to political power. Trump was born in Queens, but historically, New Yorkers have been unenthused about Trump candidacies . \nThe Mets may win, but there's more than enough suprising ironies for New Yorkers and Chicagoans to go around today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:04:08.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
