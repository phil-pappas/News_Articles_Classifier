The Chicago Cubs, their opponent in the National League Championship Series, finished 97-65.\nUpon closer inspection, the difference between the two teams becomes clear: The Mets lost all seven head-to-head matchups against the Cubs, neatly explaining the disparity.\nFor the first time in major-league history, a League Championship Series will feature one team that swept the other during the regular season. Matt Harvey will square off against Chicago left-hander Jon Lester in Game 1 on Saturday night at Citi Field (8:07 p.m. ET, TBS).\nThe Mets in the Playoffs\nInnings Limit Be Damned, Harvey Takes the Mound Against the Cubs Up on the Farm: Mets Lead Playoff Teams in Homegrown Talent From Seinfeld to Rock to Maher, Why Stand-Up Comedians Love the Mets Now, with a trip to the World Series on the line, the Mets must figure out how to do something four times that they couldn’t do even once this year.\n“I’m anxious to go play them,” pitching coach Dan Warthen said, “because we owe them a couple.”\nDespite the lopsided results in their previous meetings with Chicago, the Mets insist those games no longer matter. After all, the team they will run out against the Cubs this time hardly resembles the one they had earlier in the summer.\n“It’s a completely different team,” Harvey said. “We have a different mentality. We have a lot of different pieces. We have heart. We have drive. We’re not looking at what we did during the season.”\nNor should they. When the Mets traveled to Wrigley Field for a four-game set in mid-May, they did so with third baseman David Wright and catcher Travis d’Arnaud languishing on the disabled list. Flame-throwing right-hander Noah Syndergaard made his first career start that week, still a bundle of untapped potential.\n‘ It’s a completely different team. We have a different mentality. We have a lot of different pieces. We have heart. We have drive. We’re not looking at what we did during the season. ’\n—Matt Harvey The Cubs visited New York for three more games from June 30 through July 2 and saw a similar roster. The Mets wouldn’t promote rookie outfielder Michael Conforto to the majors until July 24, wouldn’t trade for slugger Yoenis Cespedes until July 31, and wouldn’t reactivate Wright until Aug. 24. In their final game against the Cubs, the Mets started Darrell Ceciliani in center field, Eric Campbell in left field and Johnny Monell behind the plate. That won’t happen this time.\n“The young pitching we have has a little more experience. The offense is better,” said general manager Sandy Alderson. “But they’re a very good team. They have great pitching and an outstanding young lineup. It’s going to be a great series.”\nAnd a difficult one. Despite losing starting shortstop Addison Russell to a hamstring injury, the Cubs enter the NLCS brimming with confidence and momentum, fresh off their Division Series victory over the St. Louis Cardinals, baseball’s best team in the regular season.\nChicago boasts the sport’s most respected manager in Joe Maddon, a powerful young lineup led by Rookie of the Year favorite Kris Bryant and a dynamic pitching duo that can compete with any in the league.\nENLARGE Wilmer Flores and the Mets lost all seven games they played against the Chicago Cubs during the regular season.

He pitched especially well down the stretch, posting a 2.36 ERA in September. Lester allowed three runs in 7 1/3 innings to the Cardinals in a Game 1 NLDS loss.\nFor as well as Lester has thrown, he hardly compares with Arrieta’s historic brilliance. A favorite to win the NL Cy Young award, Arrieta went 22-6 with a 1.77 ERA in 2015. He surrendered a grand total of nine earned runs in 107 1/3 innings after the All-Star break, for a microscopic 0.75 ERA. He made two starts against the Mets in the regular season, allowing one run in eight innings each time.\nIt sounds daunting, but the Mets feel prepared for the challenge, even without starting shortstop Ruben Tejada, who broke his leg during the NLDS on Chase Utley’s controversial take-out slide. (Reserve infielder Juan Uribe will also miss the series with a chest injury.) In their NLDS victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Mets faced Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke—arguably the best two pitchers in baseball—in four of the five games and still managed to win two of those games.\n“It’s going to be a tough series, but this was a tough series, too,” outfielder Michael Cuddyer said. “We just faced two guys that arguably both could be Cy Youngs. We faced them four times in five games. That’s pretty good.”\nWhile the Mets have clearly improved since they last played the Cubs, they recognize the Cubs have retooled during that span as well. For instance, they never had to deal with rookie Kyle Schwarber, who slugged 16 home runs in 232 at-bats after arriving on June 16.\n“I don’t think you can ignore history,” Alderson said. “I think history informs the present, and certainly there have been changes. They’re not going to run out the same team tomorrow that they ran out in 1906 or whatever it was.”\nBut no team in the majors did more to reshape its image at the trade deadline than the Mets. Although Cuddyer admitted that the Cubs “obviously had our number in the regular season,” nobody cares about the 0-7 now.\n“We’ve added some good pieces,” manager Terry Collins said. “The dynamics are going to be a little different.”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KU517_NYMETS_P_20151016180907.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KU517_NYMETS_M_20151016180907.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:47:29.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
