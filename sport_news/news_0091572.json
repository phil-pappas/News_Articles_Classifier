It will help keep trains running through the rainy season.\nTwo other projects between Edmonds and Mukilteo were completed in 2013; no train-blocking events occurred in those two areas during the last rainy season.\nMeanwhile, many more riders are taking the Sounder north line this year. Through August, boardings were up 18 percent compared to 2014.\nWant to talk about the news of the day?
