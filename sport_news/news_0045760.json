Herschel Walker holds the SEC single-season rushing record with 1,891 yards set in 1981. Leonard Fournette already has 1,022 yards with a minimum of 7 games remaining (regular season plus a bowl game) and a max of 9 (SEC championship and 2 CFP games). So he needs just 870 yards in either 7 games (122 yards a game), 8 games (109), or 9 games (96). Or basically what Fournette gets in one half . . .\n-- Why make something out of nothing? Throughout the first half, ESPN analyst Rod Gilmore was convinced that Leonard Fournette was being contained by South Carolina and was desperately missing fullback John David Moore, who left the game with an injury. Oh, and then LSU played the second half. Ye of little Fournette faith.\n-- Have people not been paying attention to the kind of person and player Leonard Fournette is? Georgia RB Nick Chubb's horrific injury led commentators to bring up the ridiculous discussion (again) about whether Fournette would skip his junior season. Fournette would never ditch his teammates. More proof: his welcoming embrace of a dejected Nick Brossette Saturday?\n-- Is LSU Carolina dreamin'? These days, an LSU quarterback throws for more than 200 yards as often as LSU is the \"visitor\" in Tiger Stadium. The last time it happened? Anthony Jennings topped 200 yards in the opener against Wisconsin last season. And the last time it happened in Tiger Stadium? Nearly two years ago, when Zach Mettenberger struck for 328 yards against South Carolina-based Furman. Apparently the Tigers need to play more teams from the Palmetto State.\n-- Any bite left for the Bulldogs? Every ranked SEC team won Saturday : LSU, Alabama, Ole Miss and Florida. Oh, except, Georgia â€“ but do the big-game-vanishing Bulldogs really count?\n-- What Voodoo do LSU do lately? The Tigers could produce 5 top-7 overall picks in three sports over four years. Two have already happened: No. 7 Aaron Nola in the 2014 MLB Draft and No. 2 Alex Bregman in 2015. The three likely/possibles: Ben Simmons in the 2016 NBA Draft, Leonard Fournette in the 2017 NFL Draft and pitcher Alex Lange in the 2017 MLB Draft.\n-- Like father like son? Les Miles's son is a quarterback at North Carolina State, but offensive coordinator Cam Cameron's son made his college debut Saturday in a 29-7 loss to Penn State . A third-string QB at Indiana, Danny Cameron subbed in for Zander Diamont in the third quarter and went 6-for-16 for 65 yards with one interception. Weirdly, those numbers are comparable to his dad's -- for the entire 1982 season as a QB at Indiana (8-for-12, 62 yards, 1 INT, 1 TD).\n7 Wonders archives\nHow Leonard Fournette can be stopped and SEC upsets\nLeonard Fournette bests Billy Cannon's Heisman season\nFournette, Bo, Herschel, oh, and Alabama lost\nLSU's INTs vs. Auburn's TDs, facing Leonard Fournette, and Tulane's future\nLSU's CFP worries, McNeese State's 'win,' and ESPN's smart moves\nLSU offense comes together in 45-24 rout of South Carolina | Vlog LSU beat writer Jim Kleinpeter and columnist Ron Higgins break down the Tigers' victory on Saturday.", "external_links": ["http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209292397&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=5200", "http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/herschel-walker-1.html", "http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/cam-cameron-1.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:58:40.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
