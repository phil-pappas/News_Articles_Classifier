Hungary's Gabor Faldum took third in 55:15.\nJones kept pace through the 750-metre swim before falling back in the 20-kilometre bike portion of the event. He made up for it near the end of the 5-km run course.\n\"I felt strong and put a surge in with about 800 metres to go it paid off,\" said Jones.\n\"This result is a great confidence booster and will also give my ranking, which took a big bit through the injuries, a nice boost.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:46:10.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
