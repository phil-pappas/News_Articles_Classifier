The charges carry a maximum sentence of 11 years behind bars. The students, whose names were not released because they are juveniles, were arrested at their homes Friday afternoon and are in custody after an investigation by the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office revealed a plot to target a list of students and teachers at a specific school event. A detention hearing set for 1 p.m. Wednesday in front of Judge James Boscoe at the Tuolumne County Superior Court will determine whether the students may return home. “I am not in favor of them being released at all,” Krieg said. Because they are juveniles, many details are being kept under wraps by law enforcement. In addition, school administrators say they cannot release any information because of student confidentiality. As rumors about the student’s identities swirl, Sheriff Jim Mele said Tuesday that he did not release the grade levels of the suspects at a Summerville assembly Monday morning. The Sheriff’s Office continues to collect evidence and conduct interviews. Investigators will not release their findings, other than to say they found handwritten plans and confiscated various electronic devices. In a press conference Saturday, Mele said the students confessed. On Tuesday, he said he was unsure if each suspect admitted to being part of the planning. “They all said something was going to take place — some minimized it, others were more transparent,” Mele said. At Summerville last week, many teachers found out about the plot through word of mouth before being officially notified by administration, Ben Watson, a physical education teacher, said. “I have some ideas about who it may have been, only because you hear through the grapevine and you may not see them at school,” he said. But the absences alone aren’t enough to point the finger, Watson said. “There’s a lot of kids on campus whose parents aren’t having them come to school,” he said. Administrators attempted to quell concerns at a packed public forum Monday night in the school theater. Summerville parent and teacher at Mother Lode Christian School Anna Noonan was the most outspoken person at the meeting, and sharply criticized the school’s safety policies. “I wasn’t asking for a promise from school staff that nothing’s ever going to happen,” Noonan said Tuesday, who added overall she feels confident having her children there. “But, I want to know what their plans are, and I don’t feel like that was answered last night.” Noonan wants to know how staff will handle any future threats, but more importantly she wants to know how parents can be trained for an emergency, and how best to respond. Based on what she knows now, the response would be “mass confusion” if the school does not step up its drills and communication. “The first thing you’d do as a parent in a small community like this is drive to that school. We’ve never been told otherwise.” The knee-jerk response may interrupt law enforcement or put more people in danger, Noonan said. Meanwhile, Sonora Elementary held a lockdown drill Tuesday morning, a safety measure scheduled months ago. “It does hit closer to home and it affects all. But we don’t change what we do. Our job is to keep our kids safe, and it doesn’t take on any new meaning because of what happened in the county,” Principal Christopher Boyles said. The school uses ALICE drills, developed to improve response in the wake of school shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech. Investigator Ibrahim Khalil of the Sonora Police Department was on hand to assist with and review the ALICE-based drill implemented by the school last year. Big changes include a mass email sent to staff through a secure network, and the encouragement for students to not only lock, but also barricade doors. Eighth-grade PE students slid bleachers up to the door in the school gym.
