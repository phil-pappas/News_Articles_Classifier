The son is a junior and plays for the varsity team. \nThe argument continued after the two returned home, KHOU.com reports , and police said the teen grabbed a knife and stabbed his 45-year-old father repeatedly in the stomach, back and arms. \n“Clearly there are some issues going on in this house,” Sugar Land police spokesman Doug Adolph told KHOU. “This just isn’t a normal situation.” After spending most of her career in traditional print sports journalism, Cindy began blogging and tweeting, first as NFL/Redskins editor, and, since August 2010, at The Early Lead.
