But don’t blame Mike Tomlin for not trusting his kicker to win Thursday night’s game against the Baltimore Ravens. Josh Scobee had missed two kicks on the night, both late in the fourth quarter, both from under 50 yards, both to the same side of a windy field in a notoriously tough place to kick and both that separately would have essentially clinched this AFC North slobberknocker his team.\nAdChoices Would you trust him?\nNo shot. That’s why Tomlin made the right calls to go for fourth-and-shorts in overtime. But the play calls after making those decisions to go for it? It’s open season on Tomlin for those.\nOn Pittsburgh’s first OT possession, it was either punt or go for fourth-and-2 from Baltimore’s 39. The Steelers opted to run a Mike Vick sweep with an empty backfield. Using your 36-old quarterback on a play everyone in the stadium had sniffed out? That’s a game-losing decision.\nThe second decision — made after bypassing a 51-yard field goal with a kicker who missed twice in the previous 30 minutes at the same side of the field in a stadium where 50-yard field goals go to die — was a little better. Vick tried to hit Antonio Brown on a short slant. I didn’t mind the call and won’t rip Tomlin for the decision. But Vick was never good at such passes, even when he wasn’t a 36-year-old backup. And, for the second straight fourth down, Pittsburgh’s phenom running back, Le’Veon Bell, didn’t touch the ball. Vick isn’t Roethlisberger so you can’t trust him to get the ball to the reliable Brown. That’s why, if you’re not kicking, it has to go to the reliable Bell, at least once.\nPittsburgh lost for many reasons — because the team blew a 13-point lead, missed two late field goals and didn’t execute questionable play calls — but not because Mike Tomlin refused to rely on a shaky kicker hitting a 51-yarder.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeUs68.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeRqkP.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAeadnv&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Tracy", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf1Nvv.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bengals", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ravens", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf1sWt.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Packers"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:19:57.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
