He would be 95 Thursday. It’s time to turn on, tune in and drop out — Thursday would be Timothy Leary’s 95th birthday.\nLeary is popularly known as the father of LSD, but there are actually a lot of other people who played key roles in expanding the popularity of the mind-expanding drug.\nAlbert Hoffmann\nHoffman, a Swiss chemist working in a research lab, was the first person to create lysergic acid diethylamide-25, the compound more commonly known as acid.\nThough he invented the drug in 1938, it wasn’t until 1943 that he discovered its psychoactive properties — by accident.\nPATRICK STRAUB/ASSOCIATED PRESS Albert Hofmann was the Swiss chemist who first discovered acid. Hoffman unintentionally consumed some of his compound and quickly noticed its effect. A few days later, he took it again just to confirm before later going on to report his findings.\nKen Kesey\nAfter the success of 1962’s “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” 29-year-old writer Ken Kesey decided to go on a cross-country bus trip in 1963.\nHe went with his crew — called the Merry Pranksters — and they ingested copious amounts of acid along the way.\nJEFF BARNARD/AP Along with his Merry Pranksters, author Ken Kesey spread acid across the country. Tom Wolfe chronicled their experience in “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,” a book that did much to publicize the art of tripping face.\nOscar Janiger\nOscar Janiger was a Los Angeles psychiatrist in the 1950s who was interested in using LSD to treat his patients. So, he just politely wrote a letter to Sandoz, the drug’s maker, and was sent his own supply in exchange for an agreement to document patients’ experiences.\nAccording to Vanity Fair , Janiger’s acid experiments quickly took over his practice as he became increasingly popular with Hollywood creatives.\nASSOCIATED PRESS Film star Cary Grant was a big fan of tripping face. Janiger certainly wasn’t the only doctor pushing psychedelic experimentation as treatment in the 1950s, but he was one of the best known.\nCary Grant\nThe old-time actor was a big-time proponent of tripping. He started taking LSD on the advice of his psychiatrist.\nAlthough a lot of Hollywood types took hallucinogens for therapy, the “North by Northwest” star was notably public about his psychedelic adventures.\nEd Perlstein/Redferns Owsley Stanley was a famous acid maker in California. In 1959, he graced the cover of Look magazine for a profile of his LSD use, giving the drug positive press mentions and generated added interest.\nOwsley Stanley\nRolling Stone dubbed Owsley “The King of LSD.”\nHe became known as a folk hero for the exceptionally pure acid he made and distributed in the streets of Haight-Ashbury in the 1960s.\nIn fact, he became so well-known for his trippy treasures that the Oxford English Dictionary actually lists “Owsley” as a type of acid.\nkblakinger@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories On Freddie Mercury’s birthday, 11 other HIV-related deaths For her 125th birthday, nine facts about Agatha Christie 9 facts about Olympian Brian Boitano on his 52nd birthday 15 celebs who died of drug overdoses NYPD video on fake pot effects showed man on PCP: ex-cop", "external_links": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/08/drugs-in-hollywood-201008", "http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/owsley-stanley-the-king-of-lsd-20110314"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:05:31.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
