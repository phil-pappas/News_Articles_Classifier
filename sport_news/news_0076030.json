The regulator found that on the road, the VW vehicles emitted up to 40 times the permitted level of NoX. Alarmingly, a marked discrepancy in a car’s NoX emissions during laboratory and subsequently road tests would highlight the deft use of a defeat device which the US regulator EPA discovered in the VW cars.\nAn iconic automobile firm, widely known for its engineering excellence and pleasant exterior design to sway customers, cutting across nations, is now in the thick of a sordid row. The detection of the use of deceptive software has led to the resignation of the CEO Martin Winterkorn, besides triggering a wipe-out of a third of the company’s market value in one fell swoop in a short span.\nIn less than seven years after the “too big to fail” banks in the rich world were found wanting to live up to the implicit and explicit regulatory standards, it is now the turn of the consumer goods industry such as passenger car manufacturers to put profit before the safety and well-being of its clientele! Earlier, the world was privy to astronomical accounting frauds in Enron and Lehman Brothers and other skeletons tumbling out of the myriad corporate cupboards such as BP’s Deepwater Horizon and Dow Chemicals in the chemical industries sector.\nVW has a dozen subsidiaries churning out Volkswagen passenger cars — Audi, SEAT, Skoda and luxury brands such as Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche and Ducati and also VW commercial vehicles — Scania and Man. One of the few biggest firms in the world, the VW has factories spread across 31 countries. Its products are on sale in 153 countries. The question is why did such a reputed company play with the American regulatory system to understate measured emissions of nitrogen dioxide incredibly? Is making profit the be-all and end-all of corporate credo, so much so that even the best of companies would jettison their corporate social responsibility or ethics and national ethos? Western analysts and commentators writing extensively on the VW scandal contend that there were commercial and production benefits in such subterfuge, as long as it remained undetected.\nAutomarket analysts argue that in the wake of VW row, the demonisation of diesel may well get an impetus. Some of the European carmakers — BMW, Daimler, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault — have invested billions of Euro in diesel-powered cars and pushed up the vehicles’ market share to 53% of Western European sale. But in the wake of the VW egregious example, industry forecasters anticipate a steep decline in this share by 2022.\nThis is a blessing in disguise for a world wrestling with climate change challenges caused by the escalating greenhouse gases.\nJust as the G-20 countries came into being in the post-2008 financial crisis to resolve the damaging spillover effects of the banking crisis, it is time to put in place a new machinery or system so that problems such as emission of noxious gases in the atmosphere driven by greedy companies are resolved by concerted and focused action at the global level. The issue at stake is the healthy survival of humanity and not just the material gains accruing to ambitious transnational companies for their unjust corporate enrichment.\nThe author is a Delhi-based economic journalist", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:14:25.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
