By ADAM MESSER S avannah finally has its first horror convention — Halloween Terror Fest — brought to us by Alee Shriners and the folks behind Retro Mega Comic Con.\nPatrick Welsh, chairman of the Alee Shriners, met Tony Privette, owner of Retro Mega Comic Con, at the convention back in April and decided to join forces.\n“I have been scaring and building haunted houses since I was a teenager (about 25 years) and in 2009, I attended my first horror convention,” Welsh said.\n“I was amazed at all the cool things I saw and how so many people shared my interest! I have always wanted to add a horror event to go along with the haunted house.”\nWelsh said the horror-themed convention has something for everyone.\n“It’s a mix of horror, paranormal, along with some nostalgia from our days of growing up as kids,” he said. “We will have celebrity guests from not only horror movies, but other movies as well.”\nWelsh said they will have a cosplay costume contest, a question and answer panel and makeup demonstrations.\n“Throw on that Elvira costume or Michael Myers mask and be among friends having fun,” Welsh said. “There will be food available and over 50 vendors selling collectibles.”\nHe encourages fans to come out and see actors who have appeared in “The Walking Dead”and be a part of the 10-year anniversary of “The Devil’s Rejects.”\nThere will also be entertainment from David Jowers, Savannah’s magician, and most likely a joke or two from Savannah comedian Redbone, aka Michael Alcott.\nPrivette said they are expecting between 2,000 and 3,000 people at Halloween Terror Fest.\n“Like Retro Mega Comic Con in April, this show will be all items geek-related, such as comic books, vintage toys, gaming and more. With this show, it will be more horror gear ... We brought in a whole new group of dealers for the October show,” Privette said.\nSome specialize in all things scary and creepy, he said, adding that it will be nothing like the show in April.\n“We have a much bigger location for the show and a lot of new faces have joined the Retro Mega Comic Con team to bring Savannah its first horror convention,” he said.\nPrivette said the backstory came from the first Retro Mega Comic Con in April, after Welsh expressed interest in doing a horror con for the Savannah area to go along with the already growing Alee Terror Plantation.\n“I thought about it over the weekend and I thought it would be an awesome idea, being I am a huge horror fan myself, and Savannah as the most haunted city — it just seemed to fit,” Privette said.\nFun activities at the convention include a Rock ‘em Sock ‘em Robots Tournament, video game tournaments, hourly raffles for prize packs, scavenger hunts and cosplay costume contests each day.\nParty promoter Chris Cook is hosting both the kickoff and after parties at The Wormhole on Oct. 2 and Doubles Nightclub on Oct. 3, and some of the convention guests may be in attendance at those events as well.\n“There are so many things going on, you will surely find something to keep you busy all day,” Privette said.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Medical Mayhem Kickoff Party\nWhen: 10 p.m. Oct. 2\nWhere: The Wormhole, 2307 Bull St.\nCost: $5-$20; 21 and older\nInfo: www.wormholebar.com\nWhat:\nHalloween Terror Fest\nWhen: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Oct. 3 and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Oct. 4\nWhere: Alee Shrine Center, 100 Eisenberg Drive\nCost: $15 each day or $25 for both days, includes raffle entry; children 5 and younger admitted free with an adult\nInfo: www.retromegacomiccon.com\nWhat: Horror Cosplay After Party\nWhen: 10 p.m. Oct. 3\nWhere: Doubles Nightclub, 7100 Abercorn St.\nCost: $5-$10; 21 and older\nInfo: www.retromegacomiccon.com", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14768022.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZ8mc)", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14768022.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZaur", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dosavannah/id626862925?ls=1&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n53744379", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/2Ix6dHF.png", "https://bit.ly/Ke006c"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:53:12.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
