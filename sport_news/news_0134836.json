And Dwayne Harris, a former Dallas Cowboy and $17 million free-agent signee, provided it. After a Dallas touchdown pass tied the game, 20-20, Harris broke the ensuing kickoff 100 yards right up the middle and went untouched for the game-winning score with 7:01 remaining. He tied the team record for its longest kickoff return. \nStar of the game \nDominique Rodgers-Cromartie picked off two of the Giants’ three second-half interceptions against Matt Cassel. His first came with the Giants trailing, 13-10, early in the third quarter and looking listless. But he intercepted Cassel near the Giants’ sideline and raced untouched 58 yards for a touchdown. It gave the Giants a 17-13 lead with 11:19 remaining in the quarter. He picked off another Cassel pass on the first play of the fourth with Dallas driving in Giants territory. \nEye-catching \nOrleans Darkwa rushed for 41 yards on his first four carries, including a 15-yard touchdown run in the second. It gave the Giants a 7-3 lead with 11:02 remaining in the half. He almost doubled his single-game career high (21) entering the game. … After an Eli Manning interception was overturned on replay review — the pass had hit the ground first — the quarterback found Harris on a slant that he took 38 yards. It set up Josh Brown’s 47-yard field goal with 1:04 remaining in the half to cut the Dallas lead to 13-10. … On the possession following Rodgers-Cromartie’s pick-six, Cassel underthrew a hanging pass that should have been a 40-yard touchdown throw to Terrence Williams. Instead it hung long enough for Brandon Meriweather to intercept at the Giants’ 1-yard-line. … Three plays later, Rueben Randle pulled a Beckham, making a one-handed grab deep down the right sideline for a 44-yard gain. He beat Brandon Carr, the same cornerback that Odell Beckham Jr. beat last season when he made his stunning one-handed grab. The drive ended with Brown’s 34-yard field goal, his 19th consecutive made attempt, a Giants record. \nCostly mistakes \nBrown kicked the ensuing kickoff after the Giants’ first touchdown out of bounds. It set up the Cowboys at their own 40-yard line. It resulted in Dan Bailey’s 48-yard field goal in the second. On the drive, a pass-interference penalty on Devin Street wiped away a 31-yard Darren McFadden touchdown off a Cassel screen pass. … Jason Witten caught a 35-yard pass from Cassel to set up the Cowboys at the Giants’ 5. It led to McFadden’s 1-yard touchdown run and a 13-7 Cowboys lead with 2:17 remaining in the half. \nLooking ahead \nThe Giants (4-3) head to The Big Easy on Sunday to take on the New Orleans Saints (3-4) at 1 p.m. \n— Jeff Roberts © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:49:53.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
