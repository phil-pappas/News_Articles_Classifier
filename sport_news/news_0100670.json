To be known as “Environment Compensation Charge,” the tax would be Rs700 each per entry for categories 2 (light vehicles) and 3 (2 axle trucks) and Rs1,300 for categories 4 (3 axle trucks) and 5 (4 axle trucks and above). This was necessary to encourage the trucks to use NH 71 and NH 71A. At present, trucks were avoiding these two highways connecting Rewari to Panipat via Jhajjar and Rohtak because of the toll they had to pay, the SC explained. In the five-page order, a Bench comprising Chief Justice HL Dattu and Justices Arun Mishra and AK Goel pointed out that the alarming level of air pollution in Delhi was largely due to these trucks. Citing a study, it said 40-60 per cent of heavy trucks and 23 per cent of commercial vehicles plying in North India were entering Delhi despite having alternative routes. The move was expected to reduce air pollution by 25 per cent, the Bench noted. The additional tax would be utilised for augmenting public transport and improving roads, including those for cyclists and pedestrians. The apex court directed Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan to install large size bill boards at the exit points of their states to prevent commercial traffic entering Delhi. The Bench said the court would review the tax in the third week of February before the end of the four-month period on February 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:20:58.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
