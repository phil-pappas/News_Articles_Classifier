(Photo: Dale G. Young, Detroit News) \nEast Lansing — The desire to be involved in the Olympics has always been part of what makes up Tom Izzo.\nThe Michigan State basketball coach has never danced around that. When Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said in 2012 the London Games would be the last for him as head coach of United States men’s basketball national team, Izzo said he’d love to be considered as the team’s next head coach.\nAfter winning gold, however, Krzyzewski back-tracked and agreed to return. It appears now that Krzyzewski really means it, saying the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro will be his last.\nWhen Izzo was asked about that on Tuesday, it was clear his feelings haven’t changed. He’d be happy to fill whatever role happened to be available.\n“I think anybody would like to do it,” Izzo said. “I will still look to be a water boy on somebody’s staff. I just want to be a part of the Olympics sometime.”\nIzzo has worked with USA Basketball in the past. He was an assistant coach for the Goodwill Games in 2001 and also the head coach of the 2003 Pan-Am Games.\nFilling Krzyzewski’s shoes would be no simple task. He coached the U.S. to Olympic gold medals in 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London. He also won the 2010 world championship and the 2014 World Cup. He has a 75-1 record since he was hired by USA Basketball’s Jerry Colangelo in 2005.\nAs much as Izzo would relish the opportunity, he knows there are plenty of candidates.\n“I think they’ll go with an NBA guy,” Izzo said. “There’s some good college guys out there, but I think there’s a couple good NBA guys, too, that I happen to respect a lot and like. If they need a water boy, I’m the guy. We will see. You never know which direction Jerry will go and how he will do it. Mike’s had an incredible run.”\nIzzo is coming off his seventh Final Four appearance last year that ended, coincidentally, in a loss to Krzyzewski’s Duke team in the national semifinals.\nThe Spartans will take part in Midnight Madness on Friday before beginning the exhibition season Nov. 4 against Northern Michigan and tipping off the regular season on Nov. 13 against Florida Atlantic.\nmcharboneau@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/mattcharboneau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:53:14.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
