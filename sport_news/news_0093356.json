We have to continue to get better and turn some of those 2- and 3-yard carries into 4 and 5-yard carries. That is going to be an emphasis for this week. How do we make it second and six and not second and eight? Because that is a huge difference, in what it allows an offensive guy to call and different things. So we have got to keep hammering and keep doing the things that we have done well and continue to get better.” \nFifth-year senior center Mitch Smothers of Springdale, celebrating his 23rd birthday Tuesday, said between the rest the starters got during last week’s bye week and the determination to rev up the rushing game, that the Razorbacks are ready to roll. \n“We just need to get to who we are,” Smothers said. “I think we match up well against Auburn. I feel like we can really move these guys. Just getting back to who we are will be the best key.” \nSenior starting quarterback Brandon Allen said the O-line’s resolve manifested in Tuesday’s practice. \n“We still have the run game stuff,” Allen said. “We have a great running offense. I think it will come back. You will see it more. We just didn’t execute it and didn’t move too many people last time. I think we are looking forward to getting back and moving people around and creating holes for our running backs.” \nAlabama’s ease at shutting off the run apparently enabled the Tide’s pass defense to suffocate Hunter Henry, Arkansas’ junior tight end and Mackey Award candidate. \nOne 18-yard catch is all Henry logged in Tuscaloosa. \n“It’s tough,” Allen said. “Defenses obviously know where Hunter Henry is. They do a good job of trying to cover him up. We are still going to be looking at getting him the ball. Obviously he’s a playmaker. We will put different things in here and there to get him the ball and see what he can do with it and make plays for us.” \nAllen, tight ends coach Barry Lunney and Henry said the emergence of junior receiver Drew Morgan, limited to just 15 yards on 4 receptions by Alabama but with eight catches for 155 yards against Texas A&M and 5 for 110 against Tennessee; and junior college transfer and Camden Fairview grad Dominique Reed catching 33 and 54-yard touchdown passes against Tennessee and Alabama, should open more passing lanes for Henry. \nJunior tight end Jeremy Sprinkle, four catches for 41 yards against Alabama, also poses a receiving threat. \n“The receivers are doing a lot better job making plays in the passing game,” Henry said. “That will be harder for defenses to hone in on guy.” \nAfter Tuesday’s practice, Singleton was asked if junior reserve running back-fullback Kody Walker, practicing to play this week for the first time since breaking his hand in the season’s second game Sept. 12 during the 16-12 loss to Toledo, truly could figure in Saturday’s game plan. \n“Absolutely,” Singleton said. “One of the things he struggled with is he had a big club (for a cast) on his hand and that made it tough for him. He was doing some things in practice but I don’t think he was confident and I don’ think we were confident enough in what he was doing. But now he has got a much smaller brace on there, a much smaller cast. And he can carry the ball and do some things. I think he can definitely be a help his next game.” \nOffensive line coach Sam Pittman teased about fifth-year senior center Mitch Smothers turning 23. \n“He’s 23 !!” Pittman said. My gosh, when did he start school, when he was 10 or something? Happy birthday to him he’s a great kid.” \nSaturday’s game will be Arkansas’ first in Fayetteville since the Sept. 19 35-24 nonconference loss to Texas Tech. \n“It seems it’s been like a year since we played here,” Henry said. “It’s crazy. We only had two real home games because we had one (the Sept. 12 loss to Toledo) in Little Rock and one (the SEC opening loss to Texas A&M) in Dallas, too. So it’s definitely been crazy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:29:27.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
