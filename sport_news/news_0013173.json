Watching them play against Wales just recently, they're very organised at home and it's going to be difficult for the Irish. \n\"If they can go there and keep a clean sheet then try to get them back to Ireland... It's going to be difficult. They've got quality in their squad but hopefully the Irish can do it. \n\"With Shane's ability and his pace, he's always looking to get in behind teams but you've got someone like Robbie Keane who knows where the goal is. Give him an opportunity and he'll stick it in. \n\"It's going to be two difficult games home and away but hopefully they'll be well organised and up for it and they'll get the right results.\" \nFULL DRAW:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:54:26.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
