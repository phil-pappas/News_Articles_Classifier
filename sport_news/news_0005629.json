We'll give you a beer.\"\nToo obvious?\nYes, it's the Portland dance troupe's latest attempt to get more urban millennials in the seats during its upcoming season of performances at Keller Auditorium .\nLike many of the city's traditional performing arts institutions, Oregon Ballet Theatre is worried that an aging subscriber base threatens its future relevance. That's why OBT is teaming up with PBR for a new group-pricing plan called Blue Ribbon Society for its new season.\nActually, a beer-and-ballet-hangout plan might be a better description.\nGather up eight or more of your friends. Buy tickets as cheap as $10 to certain shows. Dress up -- or down. You'll get to see the performance and an invitation to an intermission party featuring free PBR tall boys, snacks, prize giveaways and \"crash courses in ballet.\"\nMillennials would really dig ballet. Natasha Kautsky, the Oregon Ballet Theatre's marketing director, just knows it.\nThe challenge is convincing young, hyper-social art lovers that watching prima ballerinas in tights and tutus equates to a fun night with friends.\nThe first Blue Ribbon Society performance will the PBR party will be held during the Oct. 17 performance of \"Amore Italiano.\" OBT Among twenty- and thirty-somethings, \"ballet is still perceived as stuffy, with old music and choreography from two centuries ago,\" Kautsky said.\nSure, it's a classical art form. But ballet has evolved beyond stick-figure ballerinas on pointe shoes. A ticket to a performance of \"Amore Italiano,\" which begins a five-night run at Keller Auditorium on Oct. 10, provides witness to \"captivating performances with finely trained athletes,\" Kautsky said.\n\"It's something very different. It's an evolving art form.\"\nThe Blue Ribbon Society ads make light of the disconnect: \"Ballet – One of the oldest and most feared of all the art forms.\"\nCertainly, 20 years ago, mixing blue-collar PBR with high-society ballet might have led to a marketing director getting canned. But Pabst Blue Ribbon has undergone its own generation-bending reinvention in recent years, becoming the cheap lager of choice for the urban creative class.\n\"It appeals to non-conformists who don't want to be told which brand they should be drinking, eating or buying,\" said Armain Austin, a Portland-based marketing director for Pabst Brewing Co.\nAs the beer's cred has grown, the familiar blue ribbon logo has become a stamp of approval that's sends a signal to artsy urbanites. \"They figure, 'Hey, PBR is involved, so something cool must be going on,'\" Austin said.\nJust this year, PBR has aligned itself with alternative art nights at the Portland Art Museum and local music festivals such as Project Pabst, which featured headliners such as Weezer and TV on the Radio.\nOBT and PBR connected during the summer through what Austin described as \"a friend of a friend\" with connections at both places.\nAt first, Pabst's marketing team had a hard time wrapping their head around the partnership. Eventually, they decided it was worth a shot. In fact, the beermaker saw it as an opportunity to test the power of its iconic brand to transform the art world.\nThe theatre's first Blue Ribbon Society performance is scheduled for Oct. 17, when tickets will be $15. During the 20-minute intermission, the second-floor Kellar Café will have a happy hour feel, with blue banners hanging from the ceiling and tubs filled with PBR 16-ouncers on tables.\nKautsky is trying to convince Michael Linsmeier, OBT's motorcycle-riding, punk-rock-drumming star, might even make an appearance. But he's also dancing in the show.\n\"It would be fun if he could just be running through the party,\" she said.\n— Joseph Rose\n503-221-8029\njrose@oregonian.com\n@josephjrose", "external_links": ["http://app.contenttools.co/polls/1877/embed.js?show_name=no&show_description=no&show_sharing_options=no&show_cover_image=no", "http://twitter.com/josephjrose", "http://obt.org/index.php/boxoffice/groups/blue-ribbon/"], "published": "2015-09-30T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:28:18.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
