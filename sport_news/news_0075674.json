Thompson had been seeking a maximum deal, while the Cavs made it known they valued the former No. 4 overall pick, but weren't going to overpay for a reserve \nThe sides had been in an awkward stalemate, which threatened to carry over into the regular season. However agent Rich Paul, who also represents star LeBron James, and Cleveland's front office were able to come to terms less than a week before the opener at Chicago. \nThere's a chance the deal will be finalized Thursday and Thompson can begin practicing. \nWhen Thompson declined to sign a one-year, $6.9 million qualifying offer from the team last month, it appeared he might be willing to sit out part of the regular season. James had called Thompson's holdout a \"distraction\" and the impasse over the contract threatened to sidetrack the Cavs from getting back to the Finals. \nBut now Thompson will back up Love and provide his usual energy for Cleveland's second unit. \nThompson came through in the playoffs after Love dislocated his left shoulder in the first round. The affable 24-year-old averaged 9.6 points and 10.8 rebounds in the postseason. He averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds in the regular season. \nCleveland chose Thompson three selections after drafting Kyrie Irving with the first overall pick in 2011. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:49:04.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
