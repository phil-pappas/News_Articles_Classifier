We talk about it every single day.”\nBYU outside linebackers coach Kelly Poppinga, on Michael Wadsworth\nPROVO — Nobody could have predicted BYU safety Michael Wadsworth’s improbable rise and his impact on the Cougar defense.\nAfter years of challenges, including his complicated, controversial transfer from the University of Hawaii; being beset by injuries; and being buried on the depth chart, the senior from Orem has been entrenched as a starter at free safety since the second week of the season.\nDuring his career, Wadsworth has tackled one trial after another. So now it's fitting that he leads the team in tackles with 48.\n“He’s been a surprise. We talk about it every single day,” said outside linebackers coach Kelly Poppinga. “If you would have told me that Michael Wadsworth was going to be a guy this year for us, there’s no way. He hadn’t done anything in the past. But man, he had a great fall camp and I'm really happy for him. I hope he continues to play at the level he’s playing at right now.”\nEven Wadsworth himself marvels about what is happening right now. He’s living a charmed life.\n“It’s been a dream of a season for sure,” he said. “It’s something that if someone would have told me this would happen six months ago, I would have thought they were lying. It’s been awesome.”\nOn top of all that, earlier this month, Wadsworth and his wife, Kara, become parents to a baby boy.\nWadsworth’s sudden emergence began when BYU coaches saw their players missing a slew of tackles in the season-opener at Nebraska on Sept. 5. Out of a sense of desperation, they turned to Wadsworth.\nThe coaching staff hadn't been expecting much of Wadsworth, “not until he came up and tackled and ran the alley against Nebraska,” said coach Bronco Mendenhall. “We were looking for a spark, someone to wrap and drive someone back. A couple of times we looked up, and it was him.”\nWhen the Cornhuskers were clinging to a 28-27 lead on their last possession with a little more than one minute remaining, they faced a fourth-and-3 from the BYU 22. A first down would have sealed a victory for Nebraska.\nThe Huskers ran a fly sweep and Wadsworth and linebacker Fred Warner stuffed Jamal Turner for a two-yard loss. Nebraska missed a 41-yard field goal on fourth down with 48 seconds left, setting up the Cougars’ game-winning drive and their dramatic Tanner Mangum-to-Mitch Mathews Hail Mary on the final play of the game.\nThat famous TD pass might not have been possible without Wadsworth's tackling.\n“That gave him a chance and he’s just made the most of it, which is really a cool story,” Mendenhall said. “Up to that point, his career had been laden with injuries and heartbreak, thinking he was getting ready to possibly compete and then getting hurt. He’s a great example of the resiliency this team is reflecting to this point.”\nWhile the Nebraska game is considered Wadsworth’s breakthrough performance, he knows it started long before then.\n“Everyone will look at the Nebraska game,” he said, “but I trace it back to the summer and training hard and preparing myself for that moment and when that moment came, I was able to capitalize on it.”\nDuring his time at BYU, Wadsworth has suffered through three pulled hamstrings and a stress fracture in his leg. Entering this season, he had a total of 12 career tackles. He was unable to participate in spring ball last March. He wasn’t listed on the two-deep after spring practices.\nBut during the summer, “I approached football like a class. I studied two or three hours a day to make sure I knew every play so I could be a calming force out there on the field and make sure everyone’s lined up correctly.”", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:06:28.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
