Besides Rasool, Ian Dev Singh made 47 while opener Adil Reshi scored 45. \n\nAsked to bat, Jammu and Kashmir lost their first wicket in the form of Shubham Khajuria (8) at the team score of 41 in 11.1 overs. Jammu and Kashmir lost two more quick wickets in Reshi and Paras Sharma (23) before Ian Dev Singh and Rasool shared 77 runs for the fourth wicket to stabilise the innings. \n\nBut Jammu and Kashmir witnessed another mini collapse when they lost four wickets by adding just 61 runs. Rasool, on the other hand, stood like a rock and played a captain's knock to hold Jammu and Kashmir's innings together. \n\nFor Himachal Pradesh, Rishi Dhawan (3/98) picked up three wickets Akash Vasisht (2/59) scalped two. \n\nBrief Scores \n\nJammu and Kashmir: 274 for eight in 90 overs (Parvez Rasool 101 not out; Rishi Dhawan 3/98)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:21:36.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
