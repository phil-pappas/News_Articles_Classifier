I ask him how he is and how is his family and speak about other things but not that. \n'I can only have that discussion with him in person and not over the phone. \n'Right now, the FA says he must apologize so that is where we are now.' \nMuntari has been involved in several bust ups with officials while on international duty but Anthony Baffoe believes his positives far outweighs his excesses. \n'Muntari has played in all the national teams and has done a lot of good things for the nation,' he added. \n'We should keep in mind that his positives are more than the negatives.' \nFor more Ghana football news visit www.ghanasoccernet.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:47:33.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
