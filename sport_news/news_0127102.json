Like, a great arm,” Likens said. “The thing is just getting him to where I felt comfortable.” \nLikens said he’s gaining more faith each day. Against Rutgers, he saw a quarterback who had better dropbacks and quicker reads. \n“He knew exactly what to look at, exactly where he wanted to throw the ball off of that particular read off the defender,” Likens said. “It was good to see.” \nCozart also showed an ability to complete a long pass — something that hasn’t been a strength in his first three seasons. After pump-faking to get the defender to bite, he hit Tyler Patrick on an out-and-up double move for a 27-yard gain in the third quarter. \n“Everything was just slowing down for me,” Cozart said. “I feel like that’s the film and the amount of time I put in in the film room. It carries over to the game field a lot. I’m starting to feel it show.” \nThere still is improvement to be made. \nThrough three weeks, Cozart remains last in the Big 12 in ESPN’s total QBR rating — a measure used to evaluate a QB’s full contributions while taking into account strength of schedule. \nLikens also has continued to struggle with knowing how much more of the offense to add. Is it better to open up the playbook to see if Cozart can handle more? Or is it best to let him continue to succeed with what he’s comfortable with? \nThe offensive coordinator also knows the two need to get better with tempo. There are times when Likens gets a play call in quickly to check out the defensive setup, though he isn’t planning on a quick snap. Other times, KU’s goal is to line up quickly and snap the ball quickly. \nIn the first instance, Likens wants to see Cozart slow things down a bit once he gets to the line. \n“Sometimes I don’t do a good job of communicating that with him on when those cases are,” Likens said. “I need to do a better job.” \nWith Ford sitting out this week with a thumb sprain and Ryan Willis still learning the offense, Cozart will once again be relied upon to lead KU’s offense against Iowa State this week. \nThough the junior is getting over his cough and congestion, he's hoping some of the calmness carries over from a week ago. \n“We had great strides as an offense, coming in, being successful,” Cozart said. “The passing game looked really nice.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:43:53.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
