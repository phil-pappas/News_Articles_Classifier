(AP) - University officials and police are reassuring jittery students that they are doing everything they can to keep Tennessee State University students safe as they continue to look for the person who shot and killed a 19-year-old man during an on-campus fight.\nTwo female students wounded in the shooting were released from Vanderbilt University Medical Center on Friday. A third female student was grazed but not hospitalized after the shooting, which happened in an outdoor courtyard on the Nashville campus during an argument over a dice game around 10:50 p.m. Thursday, Metro Nashville Police Spokesman Don Aaron said. Police have not released the students' names.\nCameron Selmon, 19, of Memphis, was killed in the shooting. He was not a student at the school, Aaron said.\nThe shooting comes just over a week after three people were wounded by gunfire at an off-campus party across the street from the university. As a temporary measure, Nashville police officers will patrol the campus on foot at night.\nSpeaking at a Friday afternoon news conference, Nashville Mayor Megan Barry and TSU President Glenda Baskin Glover said they believe the TSU campus is safe.\nGlover said the campus has spent $1 million in the past year to hire new police and security officers and improve fencing and lighting on the urban campus.\nThe North Nashville neighborhood where TSU is located has largely been left out of the city's recent development boom. Mayor Barry, who took office in September, said she wants to change that by investing in and revitalizing the neighborhood.\n\"Tennessee State University and the community that surrounds it is an incredibly important part of the fabric of our city,\" she said.\nPolice continued to search for clues as to the shooter's identity Friday. Several students used their phones to record the fight. Police said they have obtained some video, but they encouraged other students who scattered when the shooting began to come forward with further recordings and information.\n\"The person who fired those shots put innocent persons in extreme danger,\" Aaron said.\nA neighbor of Selmon's family in Memphis said residents were saddened and shocked by his death. She said she had known him since he was a young boy.\n\"He had good parents - good, loving parents,\" Harriett Freeman said by telephone. \"He was always very respectful, saying, 'Yes, ma'am' and 'No, ma'am.' ... My heart goes out to his family.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
