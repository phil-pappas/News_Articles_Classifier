(AP) - Unbeaten and on the rise, No. 16 Northwestern would like to stay that way now that Big Ten play is about to begin. \nThe Wildcats (4-0) host Minnesota (3-1) in the conference opener Saturday, hoping to build on a promising start. \nNorthwestern got off to a 4-0 start in 2013 after a 10-win season, only to blow a 10-point lead against Ohio State and free fall from there. \nThe Wildcats finished 5-7, posted an identical record in 2014, and came into this season with little fanfare. But they are looking good at the moment with wins over Stanford in the opener and at Duke two weeks ago. \nNorthwestern got by Ball State last week, and now comes a big step with the start of Big Ten play. \nMinnesota comes in with three straight wins after dropping the opener by six to then-No. 2 TCU. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:30:37.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
