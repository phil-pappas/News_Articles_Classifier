(AP) — Chris Atkins returned an interception 34 yards for a touchdown — one of three turnovers on the day in an impressive defensive effort — to help Stetson to a 37-14 win over Valparaiso on Saturday. \nStetson (2-5, 1-4 Pioneer League) limited Valparaiso to 162 total yards and forced two fumbles. \nThe Hatters took control in the first quarter with a pair of short touchdowns — a 1-yard run by Craig Carrington followed by Cole Mazza’s 1-yard TD throw to Rob Coggin — to build a lead it held the rest of the game. \nAtkins’ interception return put Stetson up 21-0 in the third quarter before Valparaiso (2-6, 1-4) averted a first half shutout with a 17-yard touchdown pass from Ryan Clark to Jean Rene. \nStetson responded with a trio of field goals, two from James LaGamma and Grant Amick’s 50-yarder, and got a 5-yard touchdown run from Chance Jackson.
