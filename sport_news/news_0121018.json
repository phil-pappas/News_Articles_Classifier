The Fighting Edsalls erased a 14-point deficit to tie the score early in the third quarter before OSU’s superior talent overwhelmed Maryland’s fatiguing defense.\nJunior quarterback Perry Hills embodied his team’s spirit by running for 170 yards and two touchdowns.\n>>  Dispatch  sports editor Ray Stein answers your questions about Buckeyes football during our weekly chat, 1 p.m. Thursday, dispatch.com/osuchat \nEdsall said afterward he hasn’t spoken to Maryland’s administration about his job status and that he will start getting his team prepared as if he’s still the coach.\nMaryland (2-4) has lost three straight games, but for one day, the Fighting Edsalls at least showed heart. That wasn’t enough to keep Maryland — playing for the first time in Columbus — from falling to 0-2 in its second Big Ten season. And it probably won’t be enough for Edsall to keep his job during this bye week.\nWhat went right Edsall made the right call in starting Hills, who was benched and didn’t play a week earlier in a 28-0 loss to Michigan in which Maryland’s other quarterbacks, Caleb Rowe and Daxx Garman, produced only 105 total yards of offense. The game plan called for Hills to run the ball, and OSU couldn’t consistently corral him on scrambles and designed runs.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! \nShining moment Maryland came to town having been outscored 73-6 in its previous two games against Michigan and West Virginia, but the Fighting Edsalls drew first blood against OSU in dramatic fashion. Hills threw a 52-yard touchdown pass to wide-open D.J. Moore for the game’s first score less than five minutes in. Drawing board\nMaryland’s pass offense looks as if it were lifted from a cave drawing. Hills completed only 10 of 27 passes for 133 yards. His one TD pass was offset by the two interceptions he threw in the second half. That gave Maryland 17 on the season, the most in the nation. “I’m disappointed in myself and how I played,” Hills said. “I missed too many things.”\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \nStar power Although Hills, who had started the season’s first two games, didn’t pass the ball well after getting his job back against OSU, his 75-yard run set up Maryland’s second TD to make it a seven-point game late in the second quarter. Hills also showed toughness while being sacked four times. “He was a warrior today,” Edsall said.\nCoach-speak “I’m really, really proud of our kids. They went out and they played their hearts out. They put all of the distractions behind them and went out there and played until the very end. I couldn’t ask for more, for what they did, as a coach today.” — Edsall\n>> Get the most out of college football season, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nTelling stat 81: That’s how many passing yards Maryland had in the game besides its 52-yard first-quarter TD completion.\nTrivial matters The Maryland defense had six tackles for loss. ...
