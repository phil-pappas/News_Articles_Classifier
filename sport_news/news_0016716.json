He nearly doubled the old pending record, which he also owned, of 486 pounds with this 848-pound monster. mmoutdoors@cox.net \nAs outdoors men and women, we all aspire to great heights. \nWhether it be to catch a bunch of fish, shoot the biggest deer or have the most fun possible, every outdoors enthusiast has some sort of goal in mind when they head afield or to their favorite body of water. Trying to reach those goals is half the fun, as the thrill is in the chase in many cases. \nUnfortunately, some hunters may never get all the way to the “top” and come up a bit short. That’s OK, too, as any time spent outdoors hunting or fishing is all good. Veteran hunters and anglers try for years, sometimes decades, and still never come up with a whopper of an outdoor tale. \nBut there’s no substitute for experience and that can pay off. However, someone also said it’s better to be lucky than good. Whether it was limited experience, or luck, you can bet that these three fortunate youngsters are counting their lucky stars for what they’ve been able to accomplish recently in the great outdoors in Kansas and beyond. \nCLAYTON BRUMMER, 16, KANSAS — Many deer hunters search for decades for the buck-of-a-lifetime. Stafford resident Clayton Brummer has only been alive for 16 years and deer hunting even less time. But that didn’t stop him from shooting one of the biggest bucks likely to be taken in the Sunflower State this year during the recent youth deer season. \nBrummer was hunting with his father, Darin, early in the season when they saw a huge nontypical whitetail in a milo field. His dad advised against a shot since they could only see its head and neck. Clayton listened to his father and wondered if he’d ever see the deer again. \nHis patience would pay off when they hunted again later and the huge buck once again exited the milo field and slipped into some standing corn. Darin was glassing other parts of the field when the huge buck stepped out of the corn only 30 yards away and Clayton knew he’d better hurry up and shoot as the buck looked ready to bolt. \nThe buck died instantly and the Brummers walked up to it. It looked huge and seemed to grow as the rack itself was narrow but admittedly had antler tines going every which way. The huge nontypical whitetail had started to shed his velvet, making him look even more ominous as they admired the huge rack with 21 points. It’s been green-scored at better than 230 gross inches of antlers, which makes it a whopper and world class to boot. \nClayton plans to mount the buck and will have a hard time topping this one as it truly is a once-in-a-lifetime buck. \nELLA HAWK, 10, TEXAS — Any would-be suitors looking to break this young lady’s heart down the road better take note. Young Ella Hawk recently shot one of the biggest alligators in Texas, an 800-pound monster stretching 13 feet long, and she did it with a crossbow and made a perfect shot. \nThe young lady isn’t even as tall as the alligator’s tail, although the 10-year-old admitted she wasn’t nervous before taking the shot on the Guadalupe River. The shot hit the huge prehistoric-looking beast right between the eyes. Hawk’s guide, Ryan Longer, said that had Hawk missed the shot or not made a good one the alligator hunt could have turned out much differently as a beast of that size could quickly escape. \nHawk is a seasoned hunter, according to reports, and has hunted axis deer, rams and chital, and also accompanied her father on other hunting outings. She has already been recognized with a World Huntress of the Year award from Trophy Game Records in Kerrville, Texas. The harvest of last month’s 800-pound alligator makes her a favorite to win the award again this year. \nKOEN NORTON, 10, CANADA — If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again is the old adage. And that’s exactly what young Koen Norton did, facetiously of course, as you’ll read. \nIn August, the 10-year-old was fishing with his father, Greg, who owns Tightline Tours out of Prince Edward Island, when he landed a monstrous bluefin tuna that weighed 486 pounds on rod and reel. He set an International Game Fish Association pending junior world record with the catch but on a recent outing beat his own record before the last one was even official. \nIn roughly the same area, the youngster landed a bluefin tuna that weighed an astonishing 847.7 pounds. It took him 1 hour and 35 minutes to battle the fish to submission and the giant fish was twice as long as the young angler was tall. \nThe IGFA has a small fry tuna record, which is held by anglers aged 10 or younger. The current record for that category weighs 48 pounds, 9 ounces. Koen thought when he first saw the fish he might have a record that may never be broken. It’s truly a fish tale of gigantic proportions and details of the catch spread rapidly. Although the IGFA said they had not received the application for the youngster’s most recent record catch, news of the really big one that didn’t get away had already reached them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:52:55.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
