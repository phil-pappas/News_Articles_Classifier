Chin had said it would be difficult for anyone to read any of the works in their entirety by repeatedly entering different search requests.\nThe appeals court agreed, saying: “Google has constructed the snippet feature in a manner that substantially protects against its serving as an effectively competing substitute for plaintiffs’ books.”\nThe Authors Guild and various authors had challenged Google, contending that the digital book project violated their rights.\nGoogle Inc. has made digital copies of tens of millions of books from major libraries and established a publicly available search function. It planned ultimately to scan over 100 million books, including material from the New York Public Library, Library of Congress and several major universities.\nThe appeals court said Google’s profit motivation does not in these circumstances justify denial of what is a fair use of the books’ content.\n“We see no reason in this case why Google’s overall profit motivation should prevail as a reason for denying fair use over its highly convincing transformative purpose,” the appeals court said in a ruling written by Judge Pierre N. Leval. “Many of the most universally accepted forms of fair use, such as news reporting and commentary, quotation in historical or analytic books, reviews of books, and performances, as well as parody, are all normally done commercially for profit.”\nLawyers did not immediately return messages seeking comment. — AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:41:28.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
