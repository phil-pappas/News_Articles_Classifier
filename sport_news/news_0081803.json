The large high will not move much during the next two to three days blocking any tropical moisture from the southern Gulf and steering it mainly towards Mexico and the Texas coast.\nOur dry spell has reached 22 days with our next rain chance coming Saturday at the earliest. Better rain chances arrive on Sunday and Monday as a weak front approaches.\nNo real cold air is expected until late next week.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
