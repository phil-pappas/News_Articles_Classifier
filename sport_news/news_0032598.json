By Joyce GodwinProsper Press \nVAN ALSTYNE — An early deficit for the Whitesboro Bearcats proved not too difficult to overcome against the Van Alstyne Panthers as Whitesboro earned a 28-26 victory over Van Alstyne in the District 5-3A (I) opener at Panther Stadium on Friday. \n“We beat a great football team tonight,” Whitesboro head coach Eddie Gill said. “They will be in the fight for a playoff spot.” \nThe Panthers (4-2, 1-0) scored first when Bryce Curtius kicked a 27-yard field goal and about two minutes later Levi Jones scored on a 36-yard run putting the Panthers up 10-0. \nBut the game started out on a shaky note for both teams. On Van Alstyne’s third play, Jon Burge threw a pass that was intercepted by Jake Dyer. \nThe Bearcats (2-4, 1-0) took over and on their fourth play, Channing Hickman had a throw intercepted by Burge. The drive that began with that turnover got the team in place for Curtius’ first field goal. \nWhitesboro’s ensuing drive stalled and the Panthers started at their 25 yard line. Jones turned in a 37-yard run, Bryce Moody passed to De’Angelo Alexander or two yards and Jones, who had 196 yards in the game, went again another 36 yards for Van Alstyne’s second score and with two minutes left in the first quarter. \nWhitesboro eventually went ahead at the end of the second quarter and maintained the slim lead throughout the second half. Dyer, who totaled 196 yards of his own, ran eight yards for a touchdown with 9:05 left in the half and the go-ahead touchdown came when Channing Hickman passed to Weston Hickman for a 23-yard score at the 2:05 mark. \n“As tough as this district is, if you don’t play your part for four quarters, you can’t win,” Van Alstyne head coach Mikeal Miller said. \nThe Bearcats started off the second half with a hard-fought drive that started on Whitesboro’s 34-yard line. Channing Hickman ran five yards and Dyer turned in 62 yards across seven carries, the last for a three-yard touchdown, and Brent Chaney ran in the conversion a 21-10 advantage. \nVan Alstyne got deep into Whitesboro’s territory and Curtius came in for a 25-yard field goal with five minutes left in the third quarter. \nAfter forcing a punt, Burge raced 50 yards to pull Van Alstyne within two points at 21-19. \nIn the fourth quarter Dyer scored again with a nine-yard run with just over two minutes remaining. \nVan Alstyne answered with a Bryce Moody 20-yard touchdown pass to Jones with only 44 seconds left. \nThe Bearcats recovered the onside kick to preserve the victory.
