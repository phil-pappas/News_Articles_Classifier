True, the Lions starters gave up three scores, including an 85-yard pass play for the first of 15 touchdowns between the two schools. \nWhile unable to end a streak of giving up at least one big play for the third consecutive week, the defensive effort against Dominion has been a key factor in a more important trend — namely a four-game win streak. \nAt 3-0 in GISA Region 1-AAA, Trinity has a chance to set up a showdown for first place next week if it can take care of business again tonight. The Lions (5-2) travel to Bethlehem Christian (2-5, 1-2), which also experienced a shootout with Dominion Christian earlier this year, winning 55-52. \nTONIGHT’S GAME \nTrinity Christian (5-2, 3-0) at Bethlehem Christian (2-5, 1-2) \nThe Knights have only played one game, however, since Sept. 25, winning a non-region matchup with First Presbyterian on the road last week. \nLed by 6-6 senior quarterback Jacob Parker, a standout on Bethlehem’s state semifinalist baseball lineup last year who has verbally committed to Georgia Southern, one might think the Lions will be in for another air attack. \nThe Knights, however, have been at their best by mixing things up. \n“Dominion was 80 percent passing. Bethlehem is about 50-50,” Matthews said on scouting the Knights. “They really like to establish the run. The games that they do well in are ones where they establish the run.” \nBethlehem’s offense has been held in check over its last two outings against 1-AAA opponents, managing just six points combined in losses to Holy Spirit and Heritage School. \nTrinity, meanwhile, put together its biggest outburst of the season last week as offensive coordinator Bruce Sills con- tinued to expand the playbook. \n“We used some new offensive sets last week and we were really happy with those,” Matthews said. “We’ll probably continue to progress in some of those.” \nTanner Johnson continued to show his versatility, stepping in at quarterback last week. He threw a pair of touchdown passes including a 53-yarder to Jim Vermilya. \n“He’s continuing to progress at quarterback,” Matthews said of Johnson. “Last year, he was really a tight end and this year he’s a fullback playing quarterback out of necessity. He gets better and better every week. The great thing about Tanner is that he’s a vocal leader and every kid looks toward him for leader- ship. It’s just a natural fit for him to be in at quarterback.” \nThe senior also moved to outside linebacker against Dominion Christian as Trinity continued to move players around due to an injury to Zach Byrom. Earlier this year, Trinity also lost senior lineman and starting tight end Drew Spiller for the season. \nOther positions, including the offensive line, have remained steady health-wise, as much a reason why Joseph Cotton and Preston McDuffie have had success in the backfield. Cotton had a 100-plus yard effort on the ground last week and added interception and kickoff returns for touchdowns in the win.
