His hands were injured when he punched the shark before it swam away.\nHis cousin, Chris Webster, says Cook swam to another surfer who paddled him to shore. He told KHON-TV it's heart-breaking that doctors had to amputate above the knee, but that Cook is in good spirits.\nCook's friend John Carper helped get him out of the water. He said the Rhode Island native is a regular at the popular surf spot where the shark bit him.\nThe Honolulu Emergency Medical Services Department says bystanders acted quickly and helped save Cook's life.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
