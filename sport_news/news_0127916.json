Along with that title comes an added bonus, a berth in the 2016-17 CONCACAF Champions League .\nJust in case you are new to FC Dallas, soccer, or MLS, the CONCACAF Champions League is our regions premier club competition. It features 24 clubs from North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. It's our regions version of the UEFA Champions League and it consists of a group stage and a championship stage.\nFC Dallas should begin CCL group play in August of 2016.\nUSSF gets four spots in each CCL. the four spots go to the MLS Cup Champ, US Open Cup Champ, Supporters Shield winner, and the other conference champion. One Canadian team makes the CCL via the Canadian Championship. If a Canadian team finishes in one of the four US spots, or if a US team finishes in two spots, the next highest ranked US team in regular season finish gets a spot.\nSo right now FC Dallas is joined by Red Bull New York (the other conference champ/Supporters Shield winner), Sporting Kansas City (USOC winner), and Vancouver Whitecaps (Canadian Championship winner). With one spot left open to be determined, the MLS Cup winner.\nNo MLS or American side has ever won the CONCACAF Champions League, which has existed since 2008. LA Galaxy (2000) and DC United (1998) did however win the previous version of the tournament called the Champions Cup. Since the conversion to the CCL only Mexican clubs have brought home the title.\nReal Salt Lake is the only US based MLS team to make the CCL Final in the 2010-11 version losing to Monterrrey. Montreal Impact made it to the final of the 2014-15 CCL losing to Club America.\nThe current 2015-16 tournament has reach the last match day of the group stage.
