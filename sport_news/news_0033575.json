Also ahead is a showdown with Starr’s Mill when the two teams play for the No. 1 seed in the subregion in two weeks. Friday’s win was the Vikings’ third shutout of the season, with Northgate having now outscored opponents by a 275-20 margin in 2015. \nAfter Friday’s victory against Forest Park, the school presented Walburn with a banner commemorating the coaching milestone, a milestone that included coaching stints at Troup County and Crisp County starting in 2001. \n“It’s exciting, but I never scored a touchdown or made a tackle,” Walburn said. “I have been surrounded by great coaches and players. It has always been a team effort.” \nWalburn’s 38th win Friday at Northgate was arguably the most dominant in school history, with the Vikings building a 62-0 lead even before this year’s Homecoming queen was crowned at the school. The second half was played under a running clock against the Panthers, who fell to 0-7 and suffered the program’s 18th consecutive loss. \nNorthgate needed just four plays to build a 21-0 lead over the Panthers and after a 45-minute first quarter the Vikings extended the margin to 37-0. \nFullback Kyle Cater scored on touchdown runs of two, seven and 37 yards to help pace the offense. \nHis first two scores game just two minutes apart early in the first quarter. \nTon Evans found the end zone twice, scoring on touchdowns of 10 and 17 yards. \nKamari Ray also found the end zone on a two-yard run and Nick Carter scored on a one-yard scamper to close out the first-half scoring. \nTrandon Torres-Niles found the end zone on a one-yard scamper for the Vikings’ only touchdown in the second half. \nThe Vikings’ defense flexed their muscles Friday, adding three safeties before halftime. \nSenior linebacker James Skalski tackled the Forest Park quarterback in the end zone for one of the safeties. He also recovered a fumble in the end zone for a touchdown. \nA botched snap that sailed over the Forest Park punter’s head rolled out of the end zone for the other safety. \nNorthgate took advantage of good field possession the entire night. All but one of the Vikings’ first-half drives started in Forest Park territory. \nThe Panthers had trouble getting its personnel on the field and was called for five illegal substitution penalties in the first quarter. \nForest Park, the school that produced University of Georgia All-American and Pittsburgh Steelers All Pro Hines Ward, has lost 18 straight games and hasn’t had a winning season since 2000, when it finished 7-3 but missed the playoffs. \nThe Panthers’ last postseason campaign was in 1996.
