Younger brother Jonathan Vickers, who starred at North Florida Christian, is a sophomore running back for the Florida State Seminoles. \nThe two teams tangle Saturday in an important Atlantic Coast Conference game. Kickoff is noon. \n“We talk almost every day, and it’s going to be fun to see everyone,” Culver said. \n“Growing up right around the corner from the stadium, you always want to play in it. Growing up you thought you’d be able to play for the Seminoles, but things happen. It’s a great opportunity for us.” \nThe showdown is a homecoming for other Cardinals, too. \nFormer Lincoln standout James Hearns is a reserve sophomore defensive end, while assistant coaches Kolby Smith and Terrell Buckley have ties to Tallahassee and FSU. \nSmith starred at Rickards High before he played at Louisville and in the NFL. \nBuckley, of course, is a former All-American cornerback for the Seminoles who left as the school's all-time leader in interceptions (21) and interception return yards (501). \nBoth joined Louisville coach Bobby Petrino’s staff when he was hired in 2014. \nCulver, a reserve who has played in 10 career games, says the rested Cardinals (2-3) are playing with renewed confidence. They have won their past two games after starting 0-3. \nLouisville also was idle last weekend and has had extra time to prepare for the undefeated Seminoles. \n“We had a rough start but we stood by each other and believed in our coaches and we started to get things rolling,” Culver said. \n“We are a young team – that’s not an excuse – and we had to get some experience. It was just a matter of time.” \nWhile FSU quarterback Everett Golson and the Seminoles offense have not committed a turnover this season, Louisville has recorded at least one turnover in its last 21 games. \nThe Cardinals led the nation with 26 interceptions last season, and have nine this season by six different players. \n“FSU is a great team, well-coached and they are disciplined,” Culver said. \n“We know it’s going to be a four-quarter game. They are a well-rounded team, and we are blessed to have this opportunity.” \nCulver and Vickers also have remained in touch this week. The two are close. After Culver signed with Louisville on National Signing Day in 2014, he rushed from Godby to NFC and watched Vickers sign with FSU. \n“He’s doing well (at FSU) but he’s not satisfied,” Culver said. \n“We both want to get better. There’s always room for improvement.” \nReach Jim Henry at jjhenry@tallahassee.com and follow on Twitter @JimHenryTALLY. 33 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1RLmNcv TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:03:58.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
