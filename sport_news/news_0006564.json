The Utes didn’t mask it after Saturday’s 42-24 loss at USC.\nLinebacker Gionni Paul said they “didn’t expect to get punched in the mouth like that.”\nUSC outscored Utah 35-10 over the final three quarters to win handily. The Trojans intercepted four passes and held the Utes to just 99 yards rushing while seizing control of the game.\n“That’s the best team we’ve played all year long — certainly from a personnel standpoint,” said Utah coach Kyle Whittingham. “Give them credit. It was tough to give them essentially three touchdowns on turnovers and hope to have a chance to win against a team of that caliber.”\nUSC middle linebacker Cameron Smith inflicted most of the damage. He intercepted Utah quarterback Travis Wilson three times, returning one 54 yards for a touchdown and taking another back to the 4-yard line.\n“They played good defense and had a lot of great athletes on their team,” Wilson said. “I need to make smarter decisions.”\nUtah’s struggles on offense included the ground game as well. Running back Devontae Booker had 62 yards rushing on only 14 carries.\nUSC coach Clay Helton noted that defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox came up with a successful scheme.\n“He said we’ve got to take Booker out of the game and force the passing game,” Helton explained. “We have a lot of respect for that kid. To be able to shut it down and get into the passing game, we thought that was to our advantage.”\nAlthough that proved to be the case, there were other variables that factored into the outcome like the play of USC quarterback Cody Kessler (264 yards passing) and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (eight catches for 143 yards). The Trojans had four rushing touchdowns and no turnovers.\nUtah safety Tevin Carter addressed some other intangibles like the Utes coming in “too flat” and “ big-headed.” He also said they were outplayed and not ready.\nThe loss snapped an eight-game win streak that dated back to last season and ended Utah’s reign as the only unbeaten team left in the Pac-12. It also led to a drop in the rankings. The Utes are No. 13 in the latest Associated Press poll and No. 14 in the coaches rankings.\nDespite the fall, not all was bad over the weekend. Paul and wide receiver Britain Covey had stellar outings against USC. Paul finished with 17 tackles, including 5.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also had a sack and a forced fumble. Covey had seven catches for 129 yards and two touchdowns. The true freshman had a 40-yard punt return as well.\nThe biggest silver lining, though, is the standings. Utah still sits atop the Pac-12 South.\n“We’re still in the driver’s seat,” Covey said.\nThe Utes (6-1, 3-1) host Oregon State (2-5, 0-4) on Saturday. That ushers in a season-ending stretch of games that includes road trips to Washington and Arizona, plus home dates against UCLA and Colorado.\n“We have to regroup,” Whittingham said. “We still have a one-game lead in the Pac-12 South loss column. All is not lost.”\nEXTRA POINTS: Covey topped the Utes with 217 all-purpose yards . . . Tom Hackett pinned three punts inside the 20-yard line . . . The Utes finished with 14 tackles for loss and four sacks . . . Marcus Williams and Jason Whittingham each finished with nine tackles . . . Hunter Dimick had a team-high 1.5 sacks.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com\nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:19:00.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
