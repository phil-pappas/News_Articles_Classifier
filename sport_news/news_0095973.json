Editor's Picks Pelton: Cavs were out of options with Thompson \nTristan Thompson's on-court production doesn't warrant his $82 million contract, but paying him was better than any alternatives for the Cavaliers. \nIt also ends a contract stalemate dating to July that caused Thompson to miss training camp and the preseason. \nThompson, 24, had been seeking a max contract of five years and $94 million or three years and $53 million. The Cavs had previously offered five years and $80 million. \nWhile Thompson settled for less than the max, his deal is larger than many league officials thought he would get heading into the summer. \nThe contract completes the Cavs' goal of bringing back the core of the team that reached the Finals last season. It cost them heavily to do so -- the contracts for LeBron James , Kevin Love , Iman Shumpert , J.R. Smith and Thompson total more than $290 million in guaranteed money. Tristan Thompson's considerable value to the Cavaliers was seen in last season's playoffs, in which he started 15 games in place of the injured Kevin Love, averaging 9.6 points and 10.8 rebounds. Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images \nIt will also come with a massive tax bill. Though the tax won't be calculated until the end of the season, and the Cavs have only 14 guaranteed contracts, they are now in line to pay in excess of $60 million in luxury tax, which would be the second highest on record. \nIncluding salaries and tax, the Cavs are likely to spend more than $170 million on this season's roster, the second-highest number in league history behind the 2013-14 Brooklyn Nets . The Nets spent $197 million that season, including a record $90.5 million in tax. \nThe Cavs now have long-term deals locked up with Love, Thompson and young star Kyrie Irving , who is starting a five-year, $94 million extension he signed in 2014. \nThompson was quick to weigh in via social media in the wake of the agreement. It's been a long summer of grinding and hard work but now it's back to The Land to take care of some... https://t.co/eD5MIBdX6W \nâ€” Tristan Thompson (@RealTristan13) October 21, 2015 \nNegotiations between the team and Thompson dragged out for more than a year. Last fall, the Cavs offered Thompson a four-year deal worth $50 million, and Thompson turned it down. \nThompson, drafted by the Cavs fourth overall in 2011 out of Texas, averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds while coming off the bench last season. His considerable value to the Cavs was seen in the playoffs, in which he started 15 games in place of an injured Love. He averaged 9.6 points and 10.8 rebounds in the postseason, helping the Cavs reach the Finals, where they lost in six games to the Warriors. \nThompson is one of the league's best offensive rebounders and averaged 4.4 per game during the playoffs. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:29:48.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
