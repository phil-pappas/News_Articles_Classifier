Her father had been minister of education in Cuba.\nCauce earned her doctorate in child clinical and community psychology from Yale University in 1984. She has held numerous leadership positions at UW and has served as its chief academic officer or provost for three years.\nDuring her seven months as interim president, she supported a legislative decision to lower university tuition, adopted Seattle's $15 minimum wage initiative even though some felt UW should be immune to the Seattle ordinance, announced a plan to expand childcare on campus, finalized a new innovation exchange with Tsinghau University in Beijing, China, and has spoken about diversity, racism and homophobia.\nAt the dedication of the university's new Native American longhouse, Intellectual House, Cauce spoke of her own experiences with prejudice and why it has been difficult for even a place as liberal as Seattle to move beyond racism.\n\"Sure there are horrible bigots and people who spread hate, and the world would be a better place if we could stop them,\" Cauce said. \"But racism and those other 'isms' are about something more profound. They are inside all of us.\"\nHistoric and cultural racism that is passed down over generations is more subtle and harder to fight, she said. It can't be willed or ignored away. \"We have to become culturally aware and self-aware,\" she said.\nHer speech kicked off a new race and equity initiative at the university.\nIn addition to being the UW's first woman president, Cauce will be the university's first openly gay president.\n\"Dr. Cauce is an outstanding choice — a longtime Husky with a deep commitment to UW, its mission and its students,\" Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:09:13.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
