The last time Utah beat the Sun Devils, the Vietnam War was still headline news, we’d never seen digital watches and the computers we now have in cell phones were the size of school lunchrooms.\nCan Utah State invite Boise State to Logan and somehow end another long win streak owned by the 21st-ranked Broncos? The Broncos have won 12 straight games over USU and appear to have a grip on the Mountain West, where they are pounding league opponents in embarrassing fashion.\nAnd in Provo, the Cougars will face an explosive passing attack in the University of Cincinnati, a team that came short against undefeated Memphis but not for the lack of firepower offensively. The Bearcats have also beaten Miami. It will help that nose guard Travis Tuiloma and middle linebacker Harvey Langi are expected to return. It is huge that defensive backs Michael Shelton and Jordan Preator, missing a week ago, are expected to by back on receiver chasing duty.\nIn a week where Pac-12 Southern Division foe UCLA plays Stanford, this week is critical for Utah to keep its momentum. If Stanford knocks off the Bruins, it only helps Utah’s script as it speeds toward a division title. With USC mired in a coaching mess, this season couldn’t have set up Kyle Whittingham any better for success.\nThe Utes should end the ASU streak. They’ll do it with a defense that plays on the edge and has developed a swagger and continues to cover for an offense that tries to find a rhythm. It’s nice to win with defense and ASU’s spread run offense will find plenty of Ute tacklers that simply appear out of nowhere to plug gaps, knock down passes and corral playmakers before major damage gets done. The streak ends in Salt Lake City.\nUtah State’s emergence on offense, coupled with a top-20 total defense may be the only resistance the MWC offers the Broncos. Who else stands in the way? This is it.\nThe Aggies may get a big break Saturday if Boise State’s FBS-leading touchdown rusher Jeremy McNichols isn’t able to return after suffering a concussion in a win at Colorado State. McNichols has 17 rushing touchdowns this season and that is a lot of consistency in the red zone for the Broncos. BSU averages 51 points and 549 yards since losing to BYU .\nThe key to this game is if USU can slow down true freshman QB Brett Rypien. If they do not do so, the Broncos will be left to pick away at USU’s proud defense and that could make for a long Friday night.\nThe Cougars need their own freshman to shake off a hamstring pull suffered last week against East Carolina. Tanner Mangum’s re-entry into that game for an inspiring 75-yard march for the winning touchdown was the stuff legends are made of; he’s already in the Hail Mary Hall of Fame.\nNo Mangum, BYU loses by 24.\nThe return of defensive players to BYU’s lineup is equally important for Bronco Mendenhall. The Cougars will need all the help they can get to pressure, blitz, cover and tackle a Bearcat attack that must be respected and is proven outside the Power 5 borders.\nCincy’s quarterbacks, starter Gunner Kiel (868 passing yards) and his replacement who came in against Miami when Kiel hurt his neck, Hayden Moore (1,061 yards), are more than capable of picking BYU apart through the air. The Bearcats have a better offense than either Utah or Utah State and is similar to what Boise State fields.\nWe’ll find out early. The Cougs and Aggies are in for battles Friday night.\nThis week’s picks:\nStanford 28, UCLA 21: Stanford is more consistent, tougher.\nUtah State 32, Boise State 28: I’m picking the upset, go Matt Wells.\nTexas A&M 24, Alabama 21: All about superior QB play.\nMichigan 17, Michigan State 14: Wolverine defense for real.\nWashington State 48, Oregon State 32: Mike Leach’s rodeo.\nLSU 27, Florida 21: Leonard Fournette is Superman.\nNotre Dame 33, Southern Cal 28: Organized versus Chaos.\nArizona 38, Colorado 21: Wildcats have too much firepower.\nUtah 28, Arizona State 21: Utes spit on the streak.\nWashington 38, Oregon 34: Ducks defenseless.\nBYU 42, Cincinnati 38: An air raid in Provo.\nLast week: 10-3; overall 47-19 (.723)\nEMAIL: dharmon@deseretnews.com .\nTWITTER: Harmonwrites", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team91.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-players.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/players/player46121.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:21:42.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
