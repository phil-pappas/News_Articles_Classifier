From left: Giorgio Armani hits a nautical note, Marc Jacobs says it in sequins and Chanel gets playful with airmail hues at its clever airport-themed runway show.\nENLARGE Excess Story\nThe fashion appetite for clothes that artfully pile on embellishment and print is at an all-time high.

No, wait, it was the Milk Duds. It was hard to choose a snack from the abundant, free selection at the Marc Jacobs spring 2016 show, staged in mid-September as a tongue-in-cheek film premiere at Manhattan’s grand Ziegfeld Theater. Oh, and there were clothes, lively fantastic looks streaming down a mock red-carpet.\nEvery season, naysayers sound the death knell for live runway shows. But there are a few things they don’t know. One is that a fashion show can make you feel something, like Givenchy’s rather touching presentation in New York, held on Sept. 11 on a west side pier from which you could see the Tribute in Light’s twin beams. A gamble? To say the least. But designer Riccardo Tisci and his collaborator, artist Marina Abramović, turned the proceedings into something beautiful rather than crass.\nOne man who will never doubt the power of the show is Chanel’s Karl Lagerfeld. This season he transformed Paris’ cavernous Grand Palais into a delightful Chanel-logoed airport, with models rolling suitcases that matched their looks.\nAnd at New York designer Alexander Wang’s bittersweet last collection for Balenciaga, Mr. Wang juxtaposed churchly environs with a can’t-not-dance-to-it hip-hop soundtrack consisting of Biggie Smalls and Tupac.\nThe biggest shocker happened off the runway, however: the appointment of Vetements co-designer Demna Gvasalia as Mr. Wang's successor. Mr. Gvasalia, whose floral dress and reconstructed jeans were street-style favorites this month, held his own low-production show in a slightly gritty Chinese restaurant in Paris. Frenzied as a mosh pit, it was one of the most buzzed-about of the week, proving you don’t need a huge budget to make a show soar.\nMore in Style & Fashion Autumn Salves: Sunscreens for Fall and Winter The Three Fashion Designers to Know This Fall Indie Denim Brands Serve Up Something Special Fall Fashion’s Victoriana Principle Fall Fashion’s New Eccentricity Phone Cases: The New It Fashion Accessory?", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR506_OD_one_M_20151008164549.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/wsj/wsj-fashion/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR516_OD_one_P_20151008165741.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR514_OD_one_M_20151008165557.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR516_OD_one_M_20151008165741.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR497_OD_one_M_20151008163351.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR497_OD_one_P_20151008163351.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR506_OD_one_P_20151008164549.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR482_OD_one_M_20151008161847.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR514_OD_one_P_20151008165557.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR482_OD_one_P_20151008161847.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:56:36.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
