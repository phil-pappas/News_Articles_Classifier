Image 9 of 9 Battle of Southland stars Begelton, Miller a must see 1 / 9 Back to Gallery \nSoutheastern Louisiana coach Ron Roberts ' tone of voice changes when talking about Lamar senior receiver Reggie Begelton and Lions' senior cornerback Harlan Miller . \nBegelton, a two-time All-Southland selection, faces elite competition in the Lions' All-American senior cornerback and the individual battle is something Roberts is most looking forward to when the teams meet Thursday at 6 p.m. in Hammond. \n\"Those are the kind of matchups we want our guys to have,\" Roberts said. \"For two all-conference guys to go against each other, that's what we want and they're going to battle all game.\" \nBegelton won the individual battle last season, catching eight passes for 117 yards. But Miller, also a two-time All-Southland First Team selection, and the Lions won the game 61-34. \nThe No. 23 Lions are notorious for playing man coverage, so Begelton and Miller expect to see a lot of each other. \nCardinals receivers coach Arlington Nunn is confident Begelton, who leads the team with 157 yards and three touchdowns, will be successful. \n\"(Reggie) has been facing guys like (Miller) his whole career,\" Nunn said. \"We've faced teams like Texas A&M and Baylor who have guys just like him, so I think Reggie is ready for the test.\" \nBegelton knows facing the 6-1, 180-pound Miller, who leads the Lions and is tied for second in the nation with three interceptions this season, will be a challenge. \n\"I think it'll be a good and competitive matchup,\" Begelton said. \"It's not going to be personal, but I want to win every time. That's the mindset you have to have.\" \nBegelton's success will be key, especially if the Cardinals aren't able to run the football effectively against the Lions' top-ranked rushing defense (75.0 yards per game). \n\"The coaches have been talking about it for the last two weeks,\" Begelton said. \"We have to establish a fluid passing attack against them if we want to be successful.\" \nRoberts is worried that even if Miller is able to neutralize Begelton, the other Lamar playmakers could burn them. \n\"(Reggie) isn't their only weapon,\" Roberts said. \"The rest of their receivers are good, their running backs and their quarterback is really good too. We're going to have to play well to stop them.\" \nSenior receiver Devonn Brown recorded his first-career 100-yard game against Sam Houston State and is ready to step up if needed. \n\"I love playing against man coverage,\" Brown said. \"It makes you feel like you have to win the battle. We know we can handle it.\" \nBegelton is keen on repeating his performance from a year ago, but he hopes to have a victory to go along with it. \n\"They have big defensive backs,\" Begelton said. \"(Miller) and those guys are probably going to be the biggest (defensive backs) we will face all year. But we're ready.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:55:23.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
