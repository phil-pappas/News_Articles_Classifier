There just isn't much blame to go around after a last-minute loss to the No. 4 team in the country.\nBut there were plenty of notable developments in the dramatic game. Here are 10 takeaways:\n1. Rutgers' biggest blunder on the failed final drive came on third down. Sure, the inexplicable fourth-down spike drew most of the attention , but the game was essentially over after quarterback Chris Laviano took a sack on third down.\nThe dagger is Michigan State only brought three rushers on the play. Right tackle J.J. Denman was beat on one side and left tackle Keith Lumpkin was beat by a stunt on the other side. The rush got on Laviano fast, but he absolutely needed to throw the ball away to keep Rutgers' hopes alive.\nWhile we're on the management of the final drive, why did Rutgers spike the ball on first down after Laviano hit Andre Patton for a 25-yard gain to the Michigan State 40? Rutgers was lined up before the clock started, so it was unnecessary to give a down away with 27 seconds remaining.\n2. We may never know exactly what happened on the fourth-down spike . Interim coach Norries Wilson took the blame , although the TV footage didn't indicate he called for the spike. Wide receiver Leonte Carroo said offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels called for the spike. Laviano said he looked to the sideline to see the coaches calling for the spike and the down markers still reading third down.\nThe explanations fall flat considering Laviano threw an incompletion on second down, so the team had a chance to regroup before the third-down sack. Everyone should have understood the situation, leaving no reason for the sack to result in chaos.\nAgain, it wasn't the difference in the game, but the lack of awareness all around was disconcerting.\n3. The ugly ending shouldn't diminish a great effort from Rutgers. All anyone could realistically ask for was a competitive game against a top opponent and the team delivered. Consider that Rutgers lost to this team by 42 points last season and there's some encouragement to be taken from the effort on Saturday.\nFrom an aggressive blitzing game plan and a successful fourth-and-6 near midfield on the tying drive, the Scarlet Knights played to win. That's not always the case for the conservative coaching staff.\n4. That said, Michigan State is not a legitimate top 5 team, as injuries are clearly taking their toll on the Spartans. MSU's signature win over Oregon loses more luster each week, as the Ducks lost to Washington State on Saturday to drop to 3-3. The Spartans will likely get exposed next week at Michigan.\nRELATED: Emotional Norries Wilson takes blame for loss\n5. Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio had his own head-scratching clock management late in the game. A 16-yard run gave the Spartans first-and-goal at the Rutgers 3 with 48 seconds remaining. Rutgers was out of timeouts, so Michigan State could have simply centered the ball on first down to set up a chip-shot field goal that would have left no time on the clock.\nEven with a shaky kicker, MSU could have taken a knee on first down, run the clock under 20 seconds and, with two timeouts remaining, run the ball twice for a shot at a touchdown that would have left Rutgers almost no time to respond.\n6. Leonte Carroo's return gives Rutgers hope for the rest of the season. The star wide receiver didn't miss a beat after a two-game suspension , catching seven passes for 134 yards and three touchdowns.\nCarroo now has 14 catches for 315 yards and six touchdowns in 2-1/2 games this season. His presence masks some of Laviano's weaknesses, as the quarterback can't help but throw deep to the wide-open Carroo.\nCan Rutgers pull out four more wins to get to a bowl? With Carroo, there's a chance.\n7. Carroo and Carlton Agudosi play the same position, but it's still unclear why they can't get on the field together occasionally. Agudosi emerged during Carroo's absence, catching nine passes for 108 yards and a touchdown in the two games .\nBut with Carroo back in the lineup, Agudosi didn't play a single snap on Saturday. It was the second time this season that Agudosi didn't get on the field. The 6-foot-6, 220-pounder is arguably the team's second best receiver. The coaching staff needs to figure out a way to get him on the field with Carroo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:01:09.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
