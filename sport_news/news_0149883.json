Arthur Lynch went from the Dolphins to the Jets to the Broncos in a span of 22 days. Now he's settling in and learning life on Denver's practice squad. Comment Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 5:10 PM Updated at 8:16 PM Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 5:10 PM Updated at 8:16 PM » Social News On his first day of practice, while with his third team in three weeks, Arthur Lynch ran his route precisely, snagging a pass out of the air with his big paws. He looked back at the huddle, expecting to see Broncos backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, or third-stringer Trevor Siemian. Instead it was Peyton Manning, the future Hall of Famer with 535 career touchdown passes and more than 70,000 passing yards. “Holy s@&#!” Lynch exclaimed. It was quite an introduction with the Broncos, who signed Lynch on Sept. 7 and assigned him to their practice squad, where he is one of 10 players who practice with the team all week, but don’t play in games. “There’s no question, the first time I caught a ball from (Manning), I thought, ‘That’s the best, if not the best, in the game,” Lynch says during a recent phone interview after a midweek practice. “I think that’s one of the things that’s surreal about the NFL is these older vets, when you were in middle school, these guys were playing. We’re all co-workers, which is what I keep telling myself. That’s how you have to approach this whole league.” Lynch, a 2009 Dartmouth High grad, wasn't actually in middle school when Manning started his first game for the Colts on Sept. 6, 1998 (a 24-15 loss to Miami). In fact, Lynch had turned 8 years old less than three months prior. 3 TEAMS IN 22 DAYS Nobody knows more about how life can change in the span of a month than Lynch, who on Aug. 16 was a member of the Miami Dolphins, the team that selected him in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL Draft after a successful college career at Georgia. One day later, the Dolphins cut Lynch, after he spent his rookie season on the injured reserve with a bad back. “One thing I’ve learned is timing is key and you need some luck and to stay healthy,” Lynch says. “Unfortunately, for me, in my first stop in Miami, I wasn’t able to stay healthy.” The next day, on Aug. 18, Lynch was claimed off waivers by the New York Jets. But after just three weeks in green — and his first NFL preseason catch — Lynch was released on Sept. 5, the final roster cutdown day, as the Jets opted to keep just two tight ends. After being released on a Saturday, Lynch’s agent contacted him on Sunday to say that if he cleared waivers, the Denver Broncos were interested. Head coach Gary Kubiak and his offensive coaching staff had been interested in Lynch since the 2014 draft, when, Lynch says, they were considering picking him for the Ravens two spots after he was scooped up by the Dolphins. “I’ve kind of had an interesting ride,” Lynch said. “My career, I don’t think it started out the way I wanted it to. I got healthy and gave it a crack in Miami. I thought it would work out with the Jets. The (Broncos) saw a future for me. I’m excited. When that opportunity comes I have to make the most of it.” SETTLING IN One would be hard-pressed to find three locales in the United States more different than Miami, New York City and Denver. Of course, Lynch hasn't had much time to experience the latter two cities. After a month in Denver, resting in the shadows of the dramatic Rockies mountain range, he’s gone out just twice in the city, spending most of his downtime studying the playbook at the apartment he shares with two practice squad teammates in Aurora, a Northwestern suburb most famous for James Holmes' theater shooting. “It’s a totally different scene than South Florida,” Lynch said. “But I kind of prefer it. It’s laid back. It’s quiet. It’s so beautiful. I’ve always been a fan of the mountains.” LIFE ON THE PRACTICE SQUAD A practice squad existence is distinctly different from the active roster — most make just $6,600 a week, chump change in the NFL — yet for five days of the week it’s essentially the same. Lynch practices with the team all week, impersonating the opposing team’s tight end — so far this season that’s been Baltimore’s Crockett Gilmore, Kansas City’s Travis Kelce, Detroit’s Eric Ebron and Minnesota’s Kyle Rudolph — to help prepare the Broncos’ defense for their weekly opponent. “You just try to give yourself and your defense the best chance possible,” Lynch says. “Some tight ends do different things and run routes different ways. The more I can mimic their game is going to help me in the long run. I try to go into every single day like it’s my game day and make plays and do things the right way. I think I’ve done a good job of that.” A few other important factors ensure the practice squad is a unique existence. Players can be claimed by any of the other 31 teams in the league, who must then place the player on their active roster. So each Monday, there’s a chance Lynch is snatched up by another team. “You don’t know where you’ll be tomorrow,” Lynch said. “I think that’s one thing you try not to think about too much. I’m trying to focus on what’s at hand.” Practice squad players also don’t travel to road games, and at home games, after warming up at the stadium, they have the option of watching from the sideline, or up in a suite, which is where Lynch spent the Broncos’ first two home games. LEARNING FROM THE VETS While the Broncos lost one of the league’s elite tight ends in the offseason when Julius Thomas signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars, they brought in 10-year veteran Owen Daniels to play in front of Virgil Green, a fifth-year player out of Nevada, and Mitchell Henry, a rookie out of Western Kentucky. “One thing I was excited about was to learn how they go about their daily routine,” Lynch says. “What do they do? Why do they do it? What do they work on? I think that’s one good thing about having a strong position room.” So what has he learned from Daniels, a two-time Pro Bowler who has played for the Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens? “It’s mostly from a technical standpoint,” Lynch says. “You do a lot of different things in different ways, like leverage in the block or if the safety is lining up two yards outside, you have leverage on his shoulder. It’s just little things you can pick up from guys who have done it a long time. Owen’s great at that. He’s the type of guy who does things the right way.” ASPIRING TO ACTIVE ROSTER The Broncos carry three active tight ends, and Manning is known to use them regularly — he'd targeted his tight end on 17 percent of passes through three games, and 16 percent last year — so an injury would presumably create an opening. “Peyton uses his tight end a lot more than most quarterbacks, and we have a lot of ways we use tight ends,” Lynch says. “Scheme-wise, I think it really fits me well. I have to play catch up with a lot of things, but this coaching staff knows me.” That’s why, despite not playing in a single regular-season NFL game so far in his career, Lynch is far from giving up on his dream of a lengthy career in the league. “That’s my No. 1 priority,” Lynch says. “I’ve always thought I had the ability and the intangibles and the measurables to be a player in this league. From here on out, I just have to take care of my body, learn my playbook and when your number is called, make the most of it. There aren’t many second chances in this league. I’m excited.” Follow Brendan Kurie on Twitter @BrendanKurieSCT By Brendan Kurie", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:33:15.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
