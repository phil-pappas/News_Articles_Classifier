But their bowlers will certainly have to pick up the pieces after giving away 570 runs to Maharashtra in the first innings.\nMeanwhile, Delhi's batting has also seen some good innings in the early part of the season with Gambhir's two knocks of 93 (against Rajasthan) and 96 (against Vidarbha) being exemplary.\nBut their knight in shining armour has been pacer Ishant, who bagged six wickets in the first innings of the game against Vidarbha and then picked three in the next to skittle out the visitors for 98.\nHis presence has certainly lifted the spirits of a team, which was fighting internal crisis till the last moment of its opening game.\nFrom the DDCA infighting to the musical chairs between the coaches' appointment, Delhi saw it all before settling into a good rhythm in their last game.\nVijay Dahiya was finally zeroed in as chief coach after Ajay Jadeja's brief appointment.\nDelhi would certainly want to take the momentum forward against Haryana on their home turf, but the side would be wary of Sehwag, who knows the Kotla wicket like the back of his hand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:55:31.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
