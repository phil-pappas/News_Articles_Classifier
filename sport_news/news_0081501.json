So this could happen to you on the street from some other idiot out there that thinks that your race means something. And it doesn't.\"\n Rico, 24, is Latino, and although he speaks English fluently, his primary language is Spanish, according to court papers.\nOn the morning of his arrest on Oct. 11, 2014, Rico told authorities that he'd downed six or seven shots of alcohol before encountering Mohammed Al Mahmood speaking Arabic with some friends in front of a 7-Eleven convenience store near 45th Avenue and Hawthorne Boulevard about 12:30 a.m.\nInvestigators say Rico first asked Mahmood if he was homosexual. When Mahmood said he wasn't, Rico started yelling insults about Mahmood's perceived religion and national origin -- including that Arabic men treat women poorly. Rico shoved and punched Mahmood, said Deputy District Attorney Rick Freud.\nMahmood didn't attend the hearing, but Freud said Mahmood has been traumatized by the encounter and that it has \"affected his opinion of our country.\"\n\"He said he wishes for me to relay to the court that he believes in equal respect for all people,\" Freud said. \"It was very sad for him to come to the U.S. after serving in the U.S. military and be treated this way.\"\nRico pleaded guilty to second-degree intimidation, a misdemeanor.\nWhen given a chance to speak, Rico -- a construction worker -- said he had been going through a difficult time in his life. He said he had turned to alcohol for relief when he encountered Mahmood on the sidewalk.\n\"All that stuff on the news going on about ISIS, so I guess I was drunk and belligerent and I just went out on somebody,\" Rico said. \"I don't remember nothing, and I just feel bad. I just wish he was here so I could apologize to him.\"\nWalker, the judge, asked Rico if he'd promise to read \"The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong Things.\" The book is about exaggerated fears over everything from mutant microbes to terrorism.\n\"Yeah, yeah. ...I like to read,\" said Rico, in promising to read the book.\nThe judge told Rico that he hopes his behavior is simply an indication that his brain hasn't fully developed yet. Recent studies show that the prefrontal cortex in men isn't finished developing until ages 26 to 28, the judge said.\nRico also pleaded guilty to felony fourth-degree domestic-violence assault in an unrelated case -- for punching his girlfriend in the head in the presence of their 2-year-old son in May, after a night of drinking.\n\"You can't drink,\" the judge said. \"Some people can't drink. It affects their brains in a negative way. You have too many unrecognized demons in your brain, and they act out when they drink.\"\nOn top of 30 days in jail, the judge followed the terms of the plea agreement by sentencing Rico to three years of probation, domestic-violence counseling, alcohol treatment and a ban on drinking alcohol during his probation.\n-- Aimee Green\nagreen@oregonian.com\n503-294-5119\no_aimee", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/place/SE+Hawthorne+Blvd+%26+SE+45th+Ave,+Portland,+OR+97215/@45.512033,-122.6161556,3a,75y,90h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sTEl9W-TehFMw_O35XCwWWg!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DTEl9W-TehFMw_O35XCwWWg%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dsearch.TACTILE.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D86%26h%3D86%26yaw%3D225.76404%26pitch%3D0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x5495a0f311bb2933:0x4fe424269b56ae47!6m1!1e1", "http://www.twitter.com/o_aimee"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:18:10.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
