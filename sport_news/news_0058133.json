According to TMZ Sports , his kidneys are still a big issue, and he also had to undergo two emergency surgeries yesterday. Additionally, he's reportedly in a “fragile mental state” at this time.\nWith that in mind, it’s probably definitely too soon for people to be cracking jokes about Odom, who reportedly reunited with Khloe Kardashian as a result of his recent ordeal. But that’s not stopping people from doing it anyway. Twitter is filled with jokes about Odom, Khloe, and James Harden right now, with more than a few people joking that Odom somehow staged a drug overdose to reunite with his wife.\nLast night, Chris Rock —who just agreed to host the Oscars next year —decided to get in on the, er, fun by tweeting about Odom. His actual tweet said “Stay strong Lamar” but the meme located within the tweet featured a joke about coke, hookers, and, well, just see for yourself:\nStay strong Lamar. pic.twitter.com/oWeciBKR9t\n— Chris Rock (@chrisrock) October 23, 2015 As we mentioned, Rock isn’t the first person to suggest this.
