Not only did head coach Tom Coughlin return for this 12th season at the helm, but the majority of offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo's coaching staff did as well, which is critical to Eli Manning's development within the system. On the defensive side of the ball, they brought back Steve Spagnuolo to fill the coordinator's role he previously filled in 2007-08, and they have spent the early part of the season adapting to what, for a young defense, is a new coach and system. This adjustment has been aided by the fact that Spagnuolo inherited most of the defensive coaching staff, so there has been a good deal of familiarity with the coaches and their respective teaching styles, if not with the scheme. \nOffense : \nUntil last week, the Giants strength in 2015 appeared to be their offense, where Eli Manning has begun to settle into McAdoo's West Coast system. McAdoo's top priority when he came to New York was to get Manning's completion percentage up to 70 percent by giving him higher-percentage throws and narrowing his decision-making range. By limiting most of his throws to quickly developing plays, where he throws after a three-step drop, the thinking goes, he'll be less vulnerable to pressure and, by extension, to the maddening interceptions that have characterized much of his career. \nThus far, the results have been quite positive. In his first year in McAdoo's system, Manning logged a career-high 63.1% completion percentage and the second lowest interception percentage (2.1%) of his career. This season, that percentage has gone down to 1.7%, and his completion percentage sits at a career-high 66%. Not surprisingly, Manning's 94.0 quarterback rating is the highest of his career. Another benefit is that his current sack percentage (the number of sacks per 100 drop-backs) is the lowest of his career. In short, all the improvements that McAdoo was to bring to New York's offense have been successfully instituted. \nNew York's most talented offensive position group is receiver, where Victor Cruz, Odell Beckham, Jr. and Rueben Randle, when healthy, are capable of stressing defenses in myriad ways. The team's vision of all three men running through secondaries has yet to be realized, however, as Cruz has yet to take a regular season snap due to a calf injury; in addition, both Randle and Beckham, Jr. have been limited by hamstring ailments. As a consequence, a supposed strength has become a lingering question mark. Against Philadelphia on Monday night, the Giants struggled to generate much in the passing game, especially in the second half. The Eagles mixed their coverages in order to frustrate Manning and doubled or bracketed Beckham to eliminate the Giants' biggest receiving threat. \nAgainst Philly, the Giants' offensive line also struggled; New York rushed for a season-low 81 yards and yielded three sacks. It was a low-water mark for a unit that has outplayed expectations early in 2015. New York had been expected to be solid inside, where center Weston Richburg is joined by guards Geoff Schwartz and Justin Pugh. The surprise has come on the outside, in the play of right tackle Marshall Newhouse and rookie LT Ereck Flowers, who was thrust into the lineup due to an injury to incumbent starter Will Beatty. As a unit, they have created running lanes and protected Manning (aided by McAdoo's system, which asks Manning to get rid of the ball quickly). \nOn Monday, the Eagles took away everything that had made the Giants' offense successful up to that point in the season. They denied Manning's first read, forcing him to hold the ball, and wait for other options to come open. To this, they added a fierce pass rush, which often meant that he didn't have the time to get to his second and third reads. Thus far, the Cowboys' most consistent position group has been the secondary. If Dallas' corners can be physical at the line of scrimmage and deny the short breaking routes—slants, hitches, shallow crosses—that are a staple of McAdoo's West Coast system, thus forcing him to bring the ball back down, they have the horses on the defensive line to get to him before other options work open. \nDefense : \nThe principal story on the defensive side of the ball for the Giants has been injuries. The big offseason news, of course, was defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul's nasty hand injury. Although he remains on the Giants' roster, he hasn't practiced; on Wednesday, Coughlin said \"I wish I knew\" in response to JPP's status. In addition, defensive end Robert Ayers and linebackers Jon Beason and Devon Kennard have missed games; although not all of them have been full participants in practice, all are expected to play against Dallas. \nIn the secondary, the news isn't so good. New York's top cornerback, Prince Amukamara, will miss the Cowboys game with a torn pectoral muscle. Two of his backfield mates, Trevin Wade and Trumaine McBride, have not practiced this week, so we should expect Jayron Hosley to start at corner opposite Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. And, as bleak as the Giant's situation is at CB, it's worse at safety where, after going through a bevy of candidates and cutting week one starter Cooper Taylor in order to get new CB signee Leon McFadden onto the roster, the current starters are slated to be rookie Landon Collins and journeyman castoff Craig Dahl. \nWhen at full strength, Spagnuolo likes to attack opposing offenses in myriad ways, mixing and matching his cast of defensive linemen—Ayers, George Selvie, Kerry Wynn, Demontre Moore—and blitzing to generate pressure. However, without an elite pass rusher and a banged-up secondary, the burning question is if Spagnuolo will play it closer to the vest in Matt Cassel's first start or if he'll try to confuse him by throwing a lot of exotic looks his way. Given that Cassel is a seasoned veteran, I'd expect Spagnuolo to play it safe, keeping the game close and waiting for him to make a mistake. \nSpecial Teams : \nThe Giants made a series of moves this offseason designed to shore up a special teams unit that was a weakness last year. Although it often takes some time for new 'teamers—even talented, experienced ones—to gel, New York's special teams have steadily improved over the first six weeks and, according to Football Outsider's weekly special teams rankings, currently sit at 10th in the NFL, well ahead of the Cowboys, who are 22nd. Dallas will have to play better than they have thus far if they are to avoid losing this phase of the game—which could well be more critical than usual, due to the fact that this is likely to be a field position game featuring two teams with crippled offenses and solid to very good defenses. \nHealth : \nThe story of the Cowboys season has been injuries. However, since Tony Romo went out in week two, the injury bug has decided to pay visits elsewhere, and the roster has enjoyed the return of key defensive players in Greg Hardy, Rolando McClain and Randy Gregory. As this has been happening, the rest of the league has been catching up; in recent weeks, the Giants have placed receiving tight end Daniel Fells on IR and seen their defensive back seven decimated, thanks to injuries to corners Amukamara and McBride and LBs Kennard and Johnathan Casillas. In the NFL, injuries are guaranteed to happen; what has the most impact is when the injuries happen, and where they are distributed. With a rash of hurts to their receiving corps (including tight ends) and the defensive back seven, the Giants are experiencing problems of timing and distribution. \nOutlook : \nA mere handful of days have passed since the Giants boasted a three-game winning streak and looked poised to establish themselves as the team to chase in the NFC East race. After a dismal performance in Philadelphia, especially on offense, combined with the aforementioned mounting injury list, they suddenly look very vulnerable. This will be the third season in a row during which the Cowboys have traveled to New York in the week after a bye to face the Giants. In 2013, they eked out a 24-21 win after Romo led them on a drive culminating in a last-second field goal; last season, it was a Romo to Dez Bryant pass with 1:01 remaining that was the final score in a 31-28 victory. \nIn both of those games, it was Tony Romo who led the stirring comeback. In the NFL, it's a safe bet to go with the team that is expected to get better quarterback play. On Sunday, Manning will clearly be the better of the two quarterbacks; the question is whether the Cowboys defense can do enough to reduce the difference, so that Dallas gets superior play from the lesser signal caller. After watching the Cowboys' now-fully stocked defensive line destroy New England and Tom Brady in the first half two weeks ago, I'd say it's a fair bet that they can. \nCheck out Shawn on Twitter @rabblerousr for much more on the Cowboys.
