The German company also said it would speed up cost cutting at the VW division, its largest by revenues, and put only the latest and “best environmental technology” in diesel vehicles. Europe’s largest carmaker is battling the biggest business crisis in its 78-year history after admitting last month it installed software in diesel vehicles to deceive US regulators about the true level of their toxic emissions. The scandal has wiped about a quarter off its market value, forced out its long-time chief executive and rocked both the global car industry and the German economy. Germany’s ZEW think tank said on Tuesday its economic sentiment index had plummeted to its lowest level in a year, in part because of the uncertainty surrounding the auto industry, which employs more than 750,000 people in the country and is a major source of export income. Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he did not think Volkswagen’s problems would do lasting damage to Europe’s largest economy, however. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:56:13.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
