(AP) - Police in Syracuse are searching a 160-acre cemetery for suspects believed to be involved in a shooting that left a 15-year-old dead and another teen injured.\nAuthorities say officers responded to Hope Avenue Wednesday night after receiving a call of shots fired. They began following a vehicle and say the suspects fired at them several times.\nThe suspects then ditched their vehicle and ran into Oakwood Cemetery. A helicopter and K-9 units were then brought in to search.\nAt a house on Hope Avenue officers found a 15-year-old boy dead on the rear porch and a 17-year-old who'd been shot in the leg. He was treated at a hospital for non-life threatening injuries.\nNearby Syracuse University was briefly put on lockdown as a precaution. Normal activities have resumed.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:08:54.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
