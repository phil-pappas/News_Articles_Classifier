(AP) - A survey of New Hampshire residents shows that they are willing to pay more for locally grown fruits and vegetables, but they may not always know where to find it.\nTwo hundred people were surveyed for the University of New Hampshire study, which said residents spend about 21 percent of their grocery budget on fresh produce. They're willing to pay more for items such as local green beans and cucumbers, though fewer are willing to pay more for organic green beans and cucumbers.\nThe research by the New Hampshire Agriculture Experiment Station at UNH showed word of mouth was residents' primary source of information on where to buy the produce. Most residents said they still buy fresh produce at grocery stores, not at the farmer's market or directly from farms.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:35:45.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
