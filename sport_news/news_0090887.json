And I'll just say this, people were like 'well, physically you just weren't ready.' I came in my freshman year and I was up for the Heisman, had a pretty good season, was the leading rusher.\" Peterson rushed for 2,960 yards and 32 touchdowns as a senior at Palestine (Texas) High School in 2003 and then totaled 1,860 yards and 15 touchdowns as a freshman at the University of Oklahoma. He finished second to Matt Leinart in Heisman voting following his freshman year and was also a finalist for the Doak Walker Award, which is awarded to the top college running back. Following his junior season, he was drafted by the Vikings in 2007 with the seventh overall pick. He was named NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year after rushing for more than 1,300 yards that season. The six-time Pro Bowler's comments came amid hype surrounding LSU sophomore running back Leonard Fournette, who rushed for 1,034 yards as a freshman in 2014. This season he has already rushed 631 yards in three games. Despite his success, Fournette will not be eligible for the NFL Draft until 2017, following his junior season. \nFor his part, Peterson told reporters he had only seen highlights of Fournette's play and that he would have to see more of the LSU running back before forming an opinion on whether he is ready for the NFL.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:58:39.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
