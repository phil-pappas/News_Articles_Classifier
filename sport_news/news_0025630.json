(AP) — South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier has told his players that he is retiring, effective immediately. The 70-year-old coach informed players of his decision Monday night, said a person close to the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because South Carolina hasn’t publicly announced Spurrier’s decision. South Carolina hasn’t named an interim coach, but likely would announce someone to finish out the season by Wednesday, the person said. The Gamecocks are 2-4 overall and 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference for the first time in Spurrier’s 23 seasons coaching in the league at Florida and South Carolina. Spurrier, in the middle of his 11th season at South Carolina, did not return messages from the AP seeking comment. The coach’s weekly press conference is still scheduled to be held at noon Tuesday. South Carolina freshman offensive lineman Christian Pellage said on Twitter, “What a crazy day... I am blessed to say I was coached by a legend. Best of luck to you Coach Spurrier. Stay cocky!” COLLEGE FOOTBALL LOS ANGELES — Southern California fired Steve Sarkisian, one day after the troubled coach was put on leave. Athletic director Pat Haden made the move one day after determining Sarkisian showed up at school in no condition to lead practice, although Haden refused to reveal specifics about the coach’s condition. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton was appointed interim coach Sunday. The school hasn’t been specific about Sarkisian’s problems, but the second-year coach had an embarrassing public display in August at a pep rally where he appeared to be intoxicated while giving a speech. Sarkisian later apologized and said he had combined alcohol and medication, but promised not to drink again during the season. “After careful consideration of what is in the best interest of the university and our student-athletes, I have made the decision to terminate Steve Sarkisian, effective immediately,” Haden said in a statement. GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Florida quarterback Will Grier has been suspended indefinitely for violating the NCAA’s policy on banned performance-enhancing drugs. Grier says he took an over-the-counter supplement and Florida plans to appeal the suspension, which is expected to last one year. Coach Jim McElwain says Grier made an honest mistake that could have been prevented by talking to the team’s medical staff. Grier was emotional while apologizing for his mistake when he spoke to reporters Monday. The eighth-ranked Gators (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) play at No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0) Saturday. Grier, a freshman, has started the last five games for the Gators. Sophomore Treon Harris is expected to start in his place. PRO FOOTBALL NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter accounts for websites Deadspin and SB Nation were suspended by the social media platform Monday night after the NFL filed notices related to their use of copyrighted video highlights. The NFL told The Associated Press that it requested Twitter “disable links to more than a dozen pirated NFL game videos and highlights that violate the NFL’s copyright,” adding that it did not request that any Twitter accounts be disabled. The NFL sent 18 Digital Millennium Copyright Act notices regarding the Gawker-owned Deadspin account, said Gawker social media strategist Terron Moore via Twitter. Both suspended accounts regularly use GIFs of highlights from sporting events, including NFL games. KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles will miss the remainder of the season with a torn ACL in his right knee. The star running back hurt his knee in the third quarter of Sunday’s loss to Chicago.
