One night after a shutout loss at Swansboro, the Vikings responded with a 6-1 victory over Richlands in a Coastal 3-A Conference soccer match that saw White Oak score six unanswered goals. The Vikings (15-5, 8-2) were coming off a tough 3-0 loss to Swansboro on Tuesday that dropped White Oak to second place in the league. And while the Vikings showed some hangover from that defeat in the first 20 minutes against the Wildcats (11-9, 5-5), White Oak overcame it and a 1-0 deficit to pull away from Richlands. “Tonight we did some things we didn’t do the last game as far as our forward runs and being able to possess the ball in the attacking third a little longer,” WOHS coach Buddy Carroll said. “Today, we ran on all cylinders.” Juniors Jalyn Garner and Noah Salgado each had two goals and an assist for the Vikings, who with the win moved within one victory of securing second place in the conference. White Oak can clinch second Thursday with a home victory over West Craven (1-13, 0-9). Richlands, meanwhile, stayed in fourth place entering its match at Havelock (4-12-1, 2-7) on Thursday. The conference gets three guaranteed playoff spots. “You only remember your last game and so hopefully we will get Havelock and forget about this one,” Richlands coach Mike Roed said. “We look to play a better game against Havelock.” The Wildcats seemed poised to avenge a 2-1 home loss to the Vikings on Sept. 17 when senior Jordan McCuiston gave Richlands a 1-0 lead with 22:49 left in the first half when he headed in a corner kick from the left side from Logan Schnieder. But the Vikings weren’t fazed. Garner tied the game at 1-1 with 13:35 left in the first half when he scored off an assist from Salgado, who then gave the Vikings a 2-1 lead four minutes later when he scored off an assist from Garner. Garner scored again with 15:23 remaining in the game off an assist from Cameron Powers to make it 3-1. “I heard my coach on the sideline yell that the goalkeeper was playing off his line, so when the ball got played into me, I just chipped it, expecting him to be off his line,” Garner said. “The forwards were making a lot of runs crisscrossing, we played hard all game and they (Wildcats) just couldn’t defend us because we kept switching off the ball.” Carroll was quite complementary toward his forwards. “They worked their butts off today. All three of them – Jayln, Cameron Powers and Noah Salgado,” Carroll said. “And they reaped the benefits.” Page 2 of 2 - Grey Goodson scored White Oak’s fourth goal with 7:15 left while Gabe Krueger scored on a penalty kick with 4:53 remaining. Salgado scored off an assist from Krueger with 1:02 left for the final goal. White Oak’s final three goals came after it was down a player, who had received a red card for being unsportsmanlike. “One thing we did was we held the ball longer than they did and we made different moves,” Garner said. “When we were a man down, we didn’t let it affect us.” Roed was asked how the game got away from the Wildcats, despite them leading 1-0 in the first half. “I think Gabe started to go up higher and got more into the attack and it seemed liked they had a little bit more energy after we made it 1-0,” he said. “We were unable to connect many passes, and some (foul) calls on (Richlands leading scorer Roman Eddleman) early took him out of the game. White Oak played well and they are a tough team.” Richlands had just four shots, including only one in the final 40 minutes with that being saved by WOHS goalkeeper Taylor Trimble. “Roman is a kid who can change a game,” Carroll said. “We just let him get in front of us and forced him to have to beat two or three guys and put him in situations where he had to pass.” Richlands 1 0 – 1 White Oak 2 4 – 6 GOALS –R: McCuiston.
