It’s so difficult to get there because the north is considered the powerhouse of tennis because of the facilities and the amount of players it has, it’s very difficult for a girl from South Jersey to get to the finals and possibly win the finals. It’s the highest level of tennis you can play and she’s doing it right now.” \nFisher was a perfect 4-0 on the weekend. \nOn Saturday, she cruised in her third- and fourth-round matchups, dropping just one game between both victories. \nFisher continued her strong play in her quarterfinal showdown with Shore’s Halah Davis on Sunday, prevailing 6-2, 6-3. While the score seemed one sided, Massaro said Davis provided a huge challenge because of her ability to chase down shots. \n“This girl was talented,” he said. “I think she should’ve been a higher seed than she was.” \nFisher’s match with Siniakowicz didn’t go as smoothly, as Siniakowicz used her powerful forehand to run away with the first set. Vineland's Fisher to be featured in Sports Illustrated \n“She started playing really powerful and strong, and I wasn’t really playing my best the first set,” Fisher said. “So after the first set was done, Mr. Massaro was telling me to think of it as a new match and start it from the beginning.” \nWhen the second set began, Fisher implemented a new strategy. She began playing to Siniakowicz’s backhand and attacked the net more. Siniakowicz was unable to answer. \n“It feels great,” Fisher said of the win. “I worked really hard and it’s definitely paying off.” \nThe ultimate payoff could come next Saturday in the state final. Both Fisher and Schrage were eliminated in last year’s state tournament by the eventual champion, Rumson-Fair Haven’s Kate Fahey — Fisher in the semis, Schrage in the championship match. \nWhile Massaro knows it’ll be tough, he believes Fisher has what it takes to claim the title. Fisher takes CAL title, finishes 40-1 \n“Stephanie Schrage is a monster from the baseline, big baseline player, very strong,” Massaro said. “But Tess has that versatile game, the all-around game. She has the short game, overhead, approach shot, she has a versatile game. It’s going to be a tough task, but No. 2 seed, she has a good chance, a very good chance.” \nJosh Friedman; (856) 563-5257; jfriedman2@gannettnj.com 88 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vineland.dj/1LpDoS2 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:30:28.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
