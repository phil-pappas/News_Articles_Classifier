Their second doubles team of seniors Smith and Pace bested Arianne Guce and Angelika Milaor, 6-3, 6-0.\nBergenfield dominated at the top of the order as singles aces Jeri Ann Ramilo and Aishwarya Gandotra recorded straight-sets wins over Indian Hills’ Brianna Chase and Mansi Bhargava.\n\"What I admire about our team this year is we have a team,\" Braves coach Keith Andrews said. \"Whether we win because of our singles or our doubles, all the girls work together and respect each other. That’s the most important thing.\"\nSmith and Pace explained their own effectiveness was the result of \"great chemistry.\"\n\"We never get mad at each other, and we always help each other out,\" Smith said. \"If one of us gets frustrated, the other will help them get going again.\"\n\"We also cover each other’s strengths and weaknesses,\" Pace said. \"I’m good at the net. And Caroline is good at the baseline, so it’s a good balance.\"\nStanley and Schlam said their prowess as a pair is the result of an unspoken understanding – or \"telepathy\" – they share on the court.\n\"Both of us know where the other one is going to be and what they’re going to be doing,\" Stanley said. \"We play really well together and have a lot of fun. Other than that, I don’t know how to explain it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:33:00.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
