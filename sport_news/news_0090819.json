The Cubs led the Marlins 3-0 and were five outs from reaching the World Series for the first time since 1945. \nBut Bartman reaching for the ball kept Cubs outfielder Moises Alou from catching it for the second out, and the Marlins ended up scoring eight runs in the inning, winning the game 8-3 and then winning Game 7 to deny the Cubs a trip to the World Series — and leave Bartman vilified. \nMurtha said Bartman — who is 38, still lives in the Chicago area and works in financial services — has received dozens of threats over the years. \n\"Invariably when there is some publicity about it or it comes up on an anniversary date, calls come into his office or people on blogs will issue threatening-type language,\" Murtha said. \nThe latest publicity has stemmed from a group of Cubs fans trying to raise money to pay for Bartman to attend the Cubs’ NL wild-card game against the Pirates in Pittsburgh next week. The group has raised $3,475 toward its goal of $5,000 and said the money will go Alzheimer's Association if Bartman does not accept it, according to the group’s gofundme.com page. \nBut Murtha expressed concern about where the money would go and said Bartman has redirected donations to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation in the name of Ron Santo, the Cubs’ All-Star third baseman who struggled with diabetes before his death in 2010. \nThe gifts Bartman donated to the foundation included radial keratotomy surgery — a procedure to correct nearsightedness — that Murtha said a doctor offered because Bartman would presumably have been able to see without eyeglasses and \"it would somehow act as a disguise.\" \nInstead, Bartman kept his glasses, and a low profile, even when he had a chance to cash in. He once turned down a six-figure offer to be in an H&R Block commercial that aired during the Super Bowl, according to Murtha. \nBut TV has kept Bartman connected with the Cubs, and he’ll be watching them when they resume their pursuit of the World Series, according to Murtha. \n\"Of course he’ll be rooting for the Cubs,\" he said. \"That’s never changed. Nor will it.\" \nGALLERY: Teams celebrate postseason berths Oct. 1 Rangers relief pitcher Shawn Tolleson is doused with water and Powerade by teammates after Texas clinched a postseason berth.

The Toronto Blue Jays ended baseball's longest playoff drought without even knowing about it. Toronto enters play believing it could clinch a wild card by beating the Tampa Bay Rays, and with losses by Minnesota and the Los Angeles Angels. Not long after the Blue Jays beat the Rays 5-3, Minnesota lost 6-4 at Detroit. But when the Angels defeated Seattle 8-4, it looked as if Toronto would need one more victory Saturday to halt its 22-year postseason absence. It turns out, however, that because of the remaining schedules of the Rangers, Astros and Angels, the Blue Jays had clinched at least a wild-card spot, no matter what.
