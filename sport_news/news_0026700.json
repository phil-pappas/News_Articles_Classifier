(AP Photo/Rui Vieira) \nLONDON — Juergen Klopp's first game since taking over as Liverpool manager ended in a 0-0 draw with Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday. \nLiverpool produced a high energy display, particularly in the first half, pressing Tottenham high up the pitch and in midfield to stifle any creativity but failed to produce enough of its own incisiveness in the attacking third to win the match. \nLiverpool now has 13 points from nine games, with Tottenham on 14. \n\"I'm completely satisfied for the moment,\" Klopp said. \"This was a good first step, I can work with this. Today is ok, 0-0 is not my dream result. I saw many good things, the first 20 minutes, the pressing and counter pressing.\" \nOne reason for Liverpool's lack of an attacking edge was the surprise absence of injury-prone striker Daniel Sturridge. \nKlopp said Sturridge was injured with \"a little bit of swelling\" after contact with teammate Jordon Ibe in training. He did not put a timescale on his time out but said it \"is no problem.\" \nSturridge's absence meant Belgium striker Divock Origi made his first Premier League start for Liverpool and he hit the crossbar at White Hart Lane with a header in the 10th minute, after Emre Can flicked on a corner. \nIt marked an energetic start by Liverpool, which looked the most threatening until the 28th minute, when Tottenham carved out its most dangerous opportunity. \nAdam Lallana lost possession and Tottenham hit swiftly on the counter attack. The move finished with a shot across goal from Clinton N'jie, but Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet denied him with a stunning one-handed save. \nNine minutes later, Mignolet saved one-on-one against Harry Kane with his foot before Mamadou Sakho blocked Dele Alli's follow-up. \nOrigi went close again, in a quieter second half for Liverpool, with a low shot from the left, which was gathered by Hugo Lloris. \nLiverpool again had the majority of the ball the second period, but neither side could find a winning goal. \n\"We played with a high tempo, I'm pleased with my players and the performance,\" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said. \"We only conceded one clear chance in the first half when they were playing well.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:43:07.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
