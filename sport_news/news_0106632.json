The loss saw Malaysia drop to fifth place in the table with four points and face bottom team Pakistan on Saturday. \nIn an earlier match, Argentina clinched their second victory of the tournament by beating Pakistan 3-1 with skipper Maico Casella, completing a hat trick in the 22nd, 27th and 37th minutes. \nPakistan's only goal of the match was scored by Muhammad Qassim two minutes before the final whistle. \nMeanwhile, favourite Great Britain were held to a 4-4 draw by Australia in another match played today. \nGreat Britain who were leading 4-3 through goals from Jack Clee (9th min), Luke Taylor (27th, 35th mins), Jack Waller (67th min) were stunned by a last minute strike from Andrew Scanlon. \nAustralia’s three other goals were scored by Ryan Proctor (31st min), Frazer Gerrard (54th min) and Stephen Gale (67th min). \nMatches continue on Saturday. — Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:34:49.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
