(AP) - Brandon Silvers completed 23 of 37 attempts for 288 yards and five first-half touchdowns as Troy steamrolled New Mexico State 52-7 in a battle of Sun Belt teams in search of a first conference victory Saturday night. Silvers is the first Troy quarterback to throw five touchdown passes in a game since Kelvin Simmons accomplished the feat in 1993 against Alcorn State. Silvers threw 4 yards to K.D. Edenfield on the game's first possession, and then found Teddy Ruben from 37 yards out to make it 21-0 after one. In the second he hit Jarvis Bentley from 13 yards out and followed that with a 14-yard strike to Bryan Holmes. His fifth TD was a 54-yard pass to Ruben. Brandon Burks had 10 carries for 133 yards and a touchdown for Troy (2-5, 1-2). Larry Rose III carried 21 times for 180 yards for New Mexico State (0-7, 0-3). (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
