Posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 12:30 am | Updated: 12:44 am, Fri Oct 16, 2015. ’Devs seek six wins in a row: River Valley set to take on Wranglers in Wickenburg By DANIEL McKILLOP The Daily News MohaveDailyNews.com | 0 comments \nMOHAVE VALLEY — The Dust Devils 4 1 / 2 game shutout string ended, but they extended their winning streak to five after knocking off the Mohave High School T-birds 43-7 at River Valley High School on Oct. 9. \nThe No. 9-ranked River Valley squad, according to the Arizona Interscholastic Association Division IV power-point rankings, will try to extend its winning streak to six at 7 tonight at Wickenburg High School against the No. 23-ranked Wranglers in a Section III football game. \nThe Dust Devils threw the football during most of the first half en route to their 40-0 home win against the Kingman Academy Tigers on Oct. 2, but they did the exact opposite by amassing 450 rushing yards during their victory against the T-birds. \nAndres Galvez gained 140 yards on 10 carries with two TD runs, Bryson Fohs had 121 yards on eight carries and Devin Anderson chipped in 106 yards on 10 carries with one TD. \nRyan Economou completed 4-of-8 passes for 135 yards with two TD passes. \nEconomou tossed a 55-yard TD pass to Galvez and a 30-yard TD pass to David Larrabee. \nJacob Lee led the Dust Devils with 18 tackles, two solo, and he blocked a punt to set up River Valley’s first three points against the T-birds. \n“We all have a job and the D-line did theirs, but most of the plays in the backfield I just read the offense and shoot the gap like me and Coach Ruckle talked about.” \nRiver Valley co-head coach and defensive coordinator Mark Ruckle said if his Dust Devils defeat the Wranglers, they can move up in power points because Wickenburg has three wins this season. \nFinishing in the top eight should ensure a first-round playoff berth. \nWhen River Valley had its 4 1 / 2 game shutout streak ended by Mohave last week, the officiating crew wiped out two Dust Devils’ interceptions, which would have preserved the shutout. Larrabee’s INT was ran back for a 30-yard touchdown but was negated by a roughing-the-passer penalty and Luiz Castro’s interception at the RVHS 13 was wiped out because of a holding penalty. \nLuke Regan, William Peterson and Steven Holmes each recorded 12 tackles, Chance Miller added 11, and Logan Cummings and Enrique Porter each chipped in with 10 against the T-birds. \nThe Wranglers, who are 3-4 overall, 2-2 in Section III, defeated the Parker High School Broncs 41-20 on Oct. 9. \nWickenburg’s offense runs off a double-tight end, triple-wing formation, Ruckle said. The Wranglers ran the football 178 times and passed it 34 times during the last four games. \nShawn Holden and Zayne Arnt are the Wranglers’ primary ball carriers, Ruckle said. \n“To me, (Holden) is the better runner, but he hasn’t been running much the last two games, but he’s playing defense,” Ruckle said. “So, I don’t know what’s going on.” \nRuckle said Holden plays cornerback on defense. \nWickenburg’s offense runs much like the Mohave offense does, which is through Jason Urquiza and Takory Brown, Ruckle said. \nThe Wranglers have averaged more than 300 yards rushing per game, Ruckle said. “They pass sparingly,” he added. “They’re not bad at it when they do.” \nWickenburg threw for two touchdowns against Mohave and for two more against Kingman Academy, Ruckle said. \nKeilan James is the Wranglers’ quarterback. \n“They’re pretty successful because they run the ball so much that they so suck you in on the run,” Ruckle said. “So, they’ll go play-action and throw the pass.” \nFLASHBACK: Fohs credited linemen Anthony Marrietta, Walter Klock and tight end Parker Hessom for springing him for his 70-yard TD run against Kingman Academy on Sept. 25. \n“Once he got past the defensive backs,” Klock said, “he was gone.” \nLee, who leads the Dust Devils in tackles this season, brought down 24 ball carriers on Sept. 11 and described how he did it against the Roughriders at Youngker High School. \n“They were a run-heavy team, and I was able to read the guards and scrape and fill due to the great D-line play,” Lee said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:58:05.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
