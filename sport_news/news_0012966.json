He also accused the opposition of using minorities as vote bank by raising the bogey of communalism. \"The Dadri incident or opposition to Pakistani singer is undesirable and unfortunate. But what is the central government's relation with these incidents\", Modi told Bengali daily Ananda Bazar Patrika. This is the first time that the Prime Minister has spoken directly on the Dadri incident, where a Muslim man was killed over rumours of beef eating, though last week he had made a strong plea that Hindus and Muslims should not fight each other but poverty. He had also referred to the President's call for maintaining India's core values of tolerance and mutual respect. The Prime Minister had made his remarks last week in an election meeting after coming under attack for his \"silence\" on the Dadri incident. On his party's stand (on such incidents), Modi said, \"The BJP never supported such kind of incidents. The Opposition is raising the bogey of communalism against the BJP by bringing those incidents, but are they themselves not doing politics of polarisation\". He said, \"Such debate has taken place in the past. The BJP always opposed pseudo-secularism. Now again this debate is taking place in the face of unfortunate social malaise\". \"This debate can be resolved through dialogue and discussion,\" he said. Modi claimed those parties were resorting to such propaganda, which did not want the development of minorities and look at them as vote bank.\nCong criticises PM’s remarks\nCongress leader Sachin Pilot has criticised the Prime Minister’s remarks that his government had nothing to do with the Dadri lynching and cancellation of Ghulam Ali's Mumbai concert, saying it is not appropriate for the Centre to wash its hands of by saying that it had no role to play.\n\"I believe it is not appropriate to wash your hands by saying the new government has no role to play,\" Pilot said.\n\"I think they are trying to trivialise the issue. I think the unfortunate lynching and the death of the gentleman in Dadri is symbolic of the systematic decay in our social fabric that is being accentuated by the new government,\" he said.\n\"It's not just about politics, it's about the country. What are the kind of ideologies that we are propagating? What are the kind of people who are in position of power, whose words count for and they are somehow trying to divide the secular thinking of our nation and that I think is unacceptable to India,\" he said. —PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:52:33.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
