A victory over Teaneck and then Northern Highlands (2-2) over the next two weeks, Wayne Valley will be assured of its first winning record since 2009. \n\"We can't get too ahead of ourselves,\" head coach Roger Kotlarz said. \"One thing that can hurt us still is complacency. We're 4-0. We're very confident. Teams like that, sometimes, can get lulled to sleep. We have to guard against that.\" \nWith that in mind, Kotlarz is reminding his troops that if they keep winning, they'll be assured of at least one home playoff game and a shot at the Big North Colonial Division championship. \nFor now, Wayne Valley is taking care of business one week at a time. This past Friday, in challenging weather conditions, they blanked West Milford, 28-0. \n\"It was not one of our best games, but the weather certainly played a part in that,\" the coach said. \nKotlarz said the plan earlier in the week was to \"throw the ball significantly.\" That changed drastically, thanks to a cold, steady rain with driving, gusty winds. \n\"I hate using the word 'conservative,'\" Kotlarz said. \"We were in a situation, though, where we couldn't try to accomplish too much, too quickly. We had to take care of the football and play it safe.\" \nQuarterback Nick Goodwin threw the ball just six times. Instead, he the led the team to victory with his legs. The senior rushed for 121 yards and touchdowns of 29, 2 and 9 yards. \nGoodwin did manage to complete two passes to senior tight end Ryan Monteyne for 46 yards and another pass to senior back Vinny Tedesco for a 24 yard touchdown. Junior Nick Gould tacked on 51 yards rushing. \n\"We can pass in the rain,\" Kotlarz said. \"It was the wind that caused the most difficultly.\" \nDespite the conditions, senior place kicker Connor Olaya converted all four extra point attempts. \nThe defense, meanwhile, pitched its second shutout. Senior linebackers Adam Lounsbery, Will Kearney, Tedesco and Ryan Coyle continue to lead the Indians in tackles. Kotlarz also praised the \"up front play\" of senior Tyler Andreas and juniors Jake Pluta and Joey Monsen Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:53:43.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
