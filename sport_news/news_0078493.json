And in Roseburg, that means football. \nFriday was the first time back on the field for a game at Roseburg High School since the Umpqua Community College mass shooting on Oct. 1 . \nFootball was a brief moment of normalcy for this small town that's been overwhelmed by the national spotlight. \nRsoeburg and South Medford both paid respect to the nine victims killed in the mass shooting eight days prior with decals on their helmets. \nAnd the grandstands were filled with UCC T-shirts. Students sold them to raise money for the victims. \nSouth Medford won the game 42-13, but it didn't matter Friday night. The community showed they're Roseburg-strong. \nMore coverage:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:51:11.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
