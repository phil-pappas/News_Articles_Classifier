McCown was sacked four times and did not throw an interception. Oh, by the way: He scrambled for a 10-yard touchdown. \nHere is a capsule look at McCown's performance: \nFinal grade: A+ \nOutstanding work: An A+ in school typically means perfection. McCown would be the first to acknowledge his imperfection against the Ravens. There were plays/throws he would like to have back, two of which Baltimore nullified by penalties. \nBut McCown was so effective, on balance, that he deserved no lower than an A. Tack on the + because his team won, and he played an integral role. \nThis was not just any victory, primarily because: \n*The Browns had lost 13 of 14 to the Ravens overall and were winless in Baltimore since 2007. \n*The Ravens led, 21-9, midway through the third quarter. \n*The Browns \"saved'' their season (record now 2-3) and all but sunk that of the despised Ravens (1-4). \nMcCown helped turn what could have been a blowout loss into a stirring comeback victory on the road against an AFC North opponent. He outplayed his considerably more accomplished counterpart, Joe Flacco. \nMcBrowns Town: McCown established a franchise record for passing yards, surpassing Brian Sipe's 444 against the Baltimore Colts on Oct. 25, 1981. \nMcCown became the first quarterback in franchise history to notch three consecutive 300-yard games. On Sept. 27, he was 28-of-49 for 341 in a 27-20 loss to the Raiders in Cleveland (Grade: C-). On Oct. 4, he was 32-of-41 for 356 in a 30-27 loss at San Diego (Grade: A-). \nAs pointed out by Dan Labbe of Northeast Ohio Media Group, the three-game run has the look of what McCown did for the Chicago Bears in late November/early December 2013 -- 36-of-47 for 352 yards in a 42-21 loss at St. Louis; 23-of-36 for 355 in a 23-20 overtime loss at Minnesota; and 27-of-36 for 348 in a 45-28 victory over Dallas. \n(Who would have thought that the 2015 Browns would be free-flowing offensively and problematic defensively?) \nAesthetically pleasing: McCown's stat line Sunday included 8.96 yards per attempt, 111.3 passer rating and 80.0 Total QBR. \nMcCown's offense amassed 505 yards and 33 points. It controlled the clock for a tidy 39:16 thanks largely to going 12-for-19 on third down. \nAs sparkling as the numbers were across the board, it was not necessary to wait for all of them to be final in order to recognize excellence. McCown passed the eye test with flying colors. He got better as the game progressed and saved his best for the biggest spots. When the game sped up, he slowed down. \nMcCown supported the tangibles with off-the-charts intangibles to give the Browns quarterback play the way it ought to be. \nBefore Cleveland's first and only possession in overtime, CBS analyst Rich Gannon said: \"I've been really impressed with Josh McCown. His leadership, his ability to hang in there. Protection hasn't been great, but he's been able to move around and find the open receiver.'' \nGannon's words carry plenty of weight. He not only is an astute analyst, he is a former NFL quarterback and MVP. \nConcerning Gannon's point about the offensive line: McCown maneuvered in the pocket well enough to create numerous gains after being moved off his spot. \nFlipping out: Gannon also reserved high praise for Browns first-year offensive coordinator John DeFilippo. \nAs the Browns drove into position for a field goal in overtime, Gannon said: \"I give John DeFilippo a lot of credit for how he's called this game. He's done a terrific job calling plays. Where are all the Pro Bowlers on this football team -- at tight end, wide receiver or running back? Yet he's been able to manufacture explosive plays.'' \nNo question DeFilippo repeatedly put McCown in position to be successful (as happened the previous week, only to be let down by the defense one too many times). DeFilippo masterfully used the short-to-intermediate passing game to frustrate the Ravens' rush and to exploit their weaknesses in one-on-one coverage. Ravens linebackers, in particular, enjoy getting after the quarterback but would rather get teeth pulled than chase receivers/tight ends/running backs on quick-hit passes. \nDeFilippo mixed in running plays at opportune times. He didn't deviate from his principles when, trailing, 21-9, it would have been understandable. \nDeFilippo needed a quarterback who would be patient along with him, one who would play within the structure, not force the issue and not try to be Superman. McCown was that super man. \nG.F.B.: Browns tight end Gary Barnidge led both teams in receptions (eight) and receiving yards (139) and made a ridiculous TD catch. \nBarnidge extended his fantasy-stud stretch to three games. The combined output is 20 receptions, 319 yards and three TDs. \nPiece by piece: Here is a breakdown of each Browns pass play: \nFIRST PERIOD \nFirst possession \n1. 1st-and-10 @ Cleveland 41 \nResult: McCown, from under center, complete to running back Duke Johnson Jr. on left side for minus-1 yard. \nSkinny: Checkdown against pressure from four-man rush. \n2. 3rd-and-9 @ Cleveland 42 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, incomplete throwaway to right sideline. \nSkinny: McCown avoided sack from four-man pressure out of zone-blitz scheme. \nSecond possession \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, complete to Taylor Gabriel on left side for 6 yards. \nSkinny: Quick toss out of empty backfield. Reception made 3 yards behind line of scrimmage. \n4. 3rd-and-2 @ Cleveland 28 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, complete to Johnson on right side for 27 yards. \nSkinny: McCown popped by Elvis Dumervil on release. Johnson made reception 1 yard behind line of scrimmage, helped by block from Travis Benjamin @ Cleveland 43. Well-designed play put Johnson vs. C.J. Mosley. \n5. 2nd-and-9 @ Baltimore 44 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, incomplete intended for Andrew Hawkins on right side @ Baltimore 39. \nSkinny: Clean pocket against four-man rush. Lardarius Webb with PBU. \n6. 3rd-and-9 @ Baltimore 44 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, complete to Benjamin on right sideline for 17 yards. \nSkinny: Big-time throw by McCown, who stood in against five-man zone-blitz pressure.

McCown uncertain after that. Four-man rush but 0-line not necessarily to blame for sack. \nSECOND QUARTER \nThird possession \n9. 2nd-and-10 @ Cleveland 12 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, complete to Gabriel on right side for lost yardage NULLIFIED by Baltimore offside. \nSkinny: Ravens easily defend screen. Reception made 4 yards behind line of scrimmage. \n10. 2nd-and-5 @ Cleveland 17 \nResult: McCown, from under center, incomplete intended for Benjamin near right sideline @ Cleveland 35. \nSkinny: No pressure on McCown, who made a bad throw -- split-finger fastball to open Benjamin. Browns challenged, lost. \n11. 3rd-and-5 @ Cleveland 17 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, incomplete intended for Benjamin over middle @ Cleveland 29. \nSkinny: Medium pressure by four-man rush. Apparent miscom between McCown and Benjamin; Benjamin stopped when McCown threw in front of him. \nFourth possession \n12. 3rd-and-8 @ Cleveland 18 \nResult: McCown, at shotgun, complete to running back Isaiah Crowell on left side for 16 yards. \nSkinny: McCown pressured from right side by Webb. Well-designed screen for Crowell, who made the reception @ Cleveland 15. Left guard Joel Bitonio key block @ Cleveland 19. Good patience by McCown to let screen blocking develop. \n13. 1st-and-10 @ Cleveland 34. \nResult: McCown, from under center, intercepted by Webb on right sideline @ 50 NULLFIED by Lawrence Guy roughing the passer. \nSkinny: Bad decision, pass by McCown after roll to right. Correct call by referee Jeff Triplette, no matter what Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said. McCown's helmet struck turf in whiplash effect. \n14. 2nd-and-11 @ Cleveland 48 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, complete to Brian Hartline on right side for 5 yards. \nSkinny: Basic quick-hitter. Hartline made reception at line of scrimmage. \n15. 3rd-and-6 @ Baltimore 47 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, incomplete intended for Gabriel at left sideline @ Baltimore 27. \nSkinny: Clean pocket against four-man rush. Gabriel open but unable to get second foot in.

Hawkins made reception @ Cleveland 43. \n17. 2nd-and-3 @ Cleveland 46 \nResult: McCown, from under center, complete to Barnidge on left side for 35 yards. \nSkinny: Well-designed play: McCown play-faked, rolled right and threw across field.

Guy beat Bitonio for sack. \nSixth possession \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, complete to Johnson on right side for 2 yards. \nSkinny: Extended handoff. Johnson made the reception 7 yards behind line of scrimmage. \n22. 2nd-and-8 @ Cleveland 43 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, incomplete intended for Benjamin at left sideline @ Baltimore 15. \nSkinny: Benjamin well-covered by Kendrick Lewis, who adjusted to ball flight for PBU. \n(Cleveland delay of game) \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, complete to Hawkins over middle for 22 yards. \nSkinny: Excellent route by Hawkins, who made the reception at Cleveland 49. \n24. 1st-and-10 @ Baltimore 40 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, incomplete intended for Benjamin near left sideline. \nSkinny: Benjamin was open beginning at Baltimore 20. Pass over-shot him by several yards and landed at Baltimore 13. Not enough trajectory. \n25. 2nd-and-10 @ Baltimore 40 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, complete to Barnidge on left side for 6 yards. \nSkinny: Basic to flat. Barnidge made the reception at Baltimore 36. \n26. 3rd-and-4 @ Baltimore 34 \nResult: McCown, from shotgun, complete to Barnidge over middle for 15 yards. \nSkinny: Good throw, albeit a tad high, into tight window.
