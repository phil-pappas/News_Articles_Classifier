(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) \nOXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Chad Kelly threw for 241 yards and two touchdowns and No. 24 Mississippi used a dominant defense to beat No. 15 Texas A&M 23-3 on Saturday night. \nOle Miss (6-2, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) bounced back from last week’s loss to Memphis. Laquon Treadwell caught five passes for 102 yards and a touchdown and Jaylen Walton ran for 97 yards. \nTexas A&M (5-2, 2-2) has lost two straight. Sophomore Kyle Allen completed just 12 of 34 passes for 88 yards before being replaced by Jake Hubenak early in the fourth quarter. \nOle Miss jumped out to a 16-3 lead by halftime and put the game out of reach with a 58-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Treadwell with 9:16 left in the third quarter. \nOle Miss then relied on its defense to coast to a surprisingly one-sided win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:05:22.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
