The Bulldogs traveled to Ontario Friday and opened the Greater Oregon League season with a 29-13 win over the Tigers. Baker coach Dave Johnson has always divided the team’s season into three parts. Part 1 is the preseason. Part 2 is the GOL regular season. And, Part 3 is the post season. “This was a great win on the road,” Johnson said. “Now it’s on to Part 2 of the league championship run.” Johnson said Friday’s Homecoming game against La Grande is most likely for the GOL title. “La Grande can put points on the board,” he said. “It will be the big scoring machine against the prolific defense.” La Grande (1-0 in the GOL) is scoring 42 points a game, while Baker (1-0 in the GOL) is allowing 19 points a game. Johnson noted that the Baker defense stopped Ontario on nine of 11 third-down attempts Friday, and 2 of 3 fourth down tries. Ontario actually scored first, with 4:07 left in the first quarter. Baker quickly responded, scoring on a 1-yard quarterback run by Brad Zemmer with 9:10 left in the first half. “Give credit to the kids. It was the second week in a row where our opponent has scored first and the kids have responded,” Johnson said. Baker’s defense shut down the Tigers the rest of the game. Ontario’s other score came on an interception return. Offensively, the Bulldogs ran for more than 200 yards. Marcus Plumley led Baker with 139 yards on 25 carries. “We did a great job of rushing the ball,” Johnson said. “All of our backs ran hard. We had a lot of guys touch the ball. That’s something we always try to do, but it doesn’t always happen.” Plumley added a 1-yard TD run late in the second quarter to help boost Baker up 15-7 at halftime. Baker’s defense then played a role in the Bulldogs’ first score in the second half. With Ontario backed up to its own 5, the Tigers were forced to punt. Baker managed to partially block the kick, recovering on the Ontario 5. Zemmer then hit Grant Berry for the touchdown on the next offensive play. The Bulldogs completed their scoring later in the third period when Zemmer found Brandon Stairs over the middle for a 41-yard touchdown.
