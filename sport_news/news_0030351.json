We want to defend well, attack well, score the first goal, that is massively important in the big games.\n\"You can never promise you will score three goals in 20 minutes because that would be absolutely crazy. What we can do is start in a strong way and that is what we will try to do.\"\nTo overcome Bayern, Wenger admits Arsenal need to show a completely different attitude from the tame displays delivered in their European losses against Dinamo Zagreb and Olympiakos.\n\"We have some ground to make up in Europe as we have not been at our requested level in our first two games,\" Wenger added.\n\"Our focus has been much stronger in the Premier League than it has been in Europe and we know in this game the focus needs to be exactly the same than in the Premier League.\n\"We maybe could be suspected in the first two games of not taking the opponent seriously enough.\n\"Now we have the needed belief and confidence that we are doing something right, so that helps.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:15:14.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
