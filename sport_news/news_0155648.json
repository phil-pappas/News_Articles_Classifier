She holds the pool record in every event except the 100-yard breaststroke and diving. \n“And if she wanted to focus on that, she could probably hold the record there, too,” said Piepgras, noting that Milstroh’s younger sister Jessica, a ninth-grader, is aiming for the breaststroke record. \nBeka Stone’s diving mark is safe, unless Stone, a senior on this year’s squad, breaks it. Of course, Milstroh doesn’t dive, at least competitively. \nEverything else, including the relays, has Milstroh’s name next to it. \n“She’s an athlete you don’t see very often,” said Piepgras, who is in her 15th year coaching at Foley. “She’s pretty impressive.” \nMilstroh takes aim at several pool records at 6 p.m. Thursday when the Falcons swim at Milaca in a Granite Ridge Conference meet. \n“They’re our rivals, so it should be fun,” Milstroh said. \nThursday’s meet is sort of a warm up to the Section 5A true-team championships at 9 a.m. Saturday at Sauk Rapids. Foley is defending section champion. \n“We’re really, really looking to get to state again,” Milstroh said. “I think we can do it; we’re looking pretty good.” \nFoley has 70 swimmers out in grades 7-12. Piepgras said that Monticello and Big Lake will be formidable opponents Saturday. \n“Our goal is obviously to win it,” Piepgras said. “I’m not going to say third place at this point.” \nPiepgras said that one reason Foley has a good chance is because of Milstroh. She inspires others to compete at a higher level. \n“We have a really deep team this year,” Piepgras said. “And when you get an athlete as successful and as motivating as Kasey has been, it seems like they all strive to meet her success.” \nState medalist \nMilstroh took second in the 200 freestyle and third in the 100 freestyle at last year’s state Class A meet in Minneapolis. It makes this year’s personal goal obvious. \n“It’s my dream and one of my life goals,” Milstroh said. “Hopefully, we’ll get there this year.” \nMilstroh placed second in the 200 at the University of Minnesota Aquatics Center in a time of 1 minute, 52.72 seconds. Her 100 time of 51.75 helped her take third. \nAs for her state title dream, so far, so good. She’s ahead of last year’s pace competitively, with times better this year than at the same time last year. \n“I’m probably two or three seconds faster in the 200,” Milstroh said. “And I’m a lot faster in the other ones.” \nA natural \nMilstroh first swam competitively the summer before seventh grade, performing with the St. Cloud Gators, whose home pool is at the St. Cloud YMCA. \nShe has been qualifying for the state meet since ninth grade and is receiving college inquiries from NCAA Division I programs. \nPiepgras said a college coach was working a recent Foley meet as a meet official and admitted that Milstroh was on “his radar.” \n“Then he said: ‘I imagine she’s on a lot of coaches’ radars,’ ” Piepgras said. \nStory continues below. \nFoley High school swimmer Kasey Milstroch stands next to her times on Monday, Sept. 28., at Foley High School pool during practice.

Neither of Milstroh’s parents, Scot and Tracy Milstroh, was a competitive swimmer. \nIf anything, she probably should be a golfer. Her father is the superintendent at Wapicada Golf Course in Sauk Rapids. She plays for Foley in the spring high school season. \n“I’ve pretty much been around golf courses since I can remember,” she said. \nBut make no mistake. She’s a swimmer first. \nShe is putting in about 24,000 to 28,000 yards a week in practice, lifting weights and swimming two days a week before school and then four or five days after school depending on the meet schedule. \nPiepgras said Milstroh’s more than just a talented swimmer. She’s also a special teammate. \n“We have a senior who has been struggling with her starts after a couple of surgeries to her knees,” Pipegras said. “Kasey went up to her and told her she was an inspiration because of all the hard work she’s done to get back in the pool. \n“Someone like her doesn’t come around very often.” \nMilstroh said he’s interested in the medical field and would one day like to become a surgeon. Until then, she has a lot more swimming to do for the Falcons. \n“It’s a lot of fun,” Milstroh said. “Saturday’s going to be a good time.” \nFollow Tom Elliott on Twitter @sctimestom or call 259-3661.
