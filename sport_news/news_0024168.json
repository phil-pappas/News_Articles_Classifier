They were outstanding (against Samoa). The pack just played beautiful rugby.” \nThe match will feature veteran pair Stephen Moore and Matt Giteau in their 100th Tests, and they will become the seventh and eighth Wallabies to achieve the mark. \nMeanwhile, winger Adam Ashley-Cooper plays his 112th in the gold jersey – overtaking George Smith to become the third-most capped Wallaby, trailing only George Gregan (139) and Nathan Sharpe (116).
