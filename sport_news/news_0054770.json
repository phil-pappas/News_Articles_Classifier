They are blowing fourth-quarter leads with alarming consistency and face a near must-win game when they play at San Francisco on Thursday Night Football (KOIN-6 (CBS), NFL Network, 5:25 p.m. PT/8:25 pm ET) .\nThe Seahawks blew yet another fourth-quarter lead and collapsed in their 27-23 loss to Carolina Sunday, their second consecutive loss. Seattle's once arrogant and intimidating defense has been shaken to its core and now the team faces adversity unlike anything they've experienced in recent seasons.\nThe offense, still a bit inconsistent, looks to be turning the corner. Running back Marshawn Lynch is healthy and quarterback Russell Wilson and tight end Jimmy Graham seem to have discovered the right chemistry.\nThe 49ers have emerged from their own adversity three weeks ago and are now playing solid football. They defeated Baltimore Sunday and lost to the New York Giants by three points in Week 5. Quarterback Colin Kaepernick performed at a high level the past two weeks and could torment the vulnerable Seattle defense if he's in form.\nIf you want to watch the Seahawks take on the 49ers, here's what you need to know:\nWhat: Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers\nWhere: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, CA\nWhen: Thursday, Oct. 22, 5:25 p.m. PT/8:25 p.m. ET\nTV: KOIN-6 (CBS), NFL Network\nWatch online: You can watch the live stream online on DirecTV's live stream package\n-- Geoffrey C.
