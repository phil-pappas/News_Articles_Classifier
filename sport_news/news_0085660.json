The Ethics Board levied a $6,000 fine for failing to submit campaign finance reports from 2009 through 2012. Pourciau says he's been making payments on the fine but the court notes the state's election code requires outstanding ethics debts to be repaid before qualifying.\nPourciau's disqualification means an automatic win for challenger, Mitch Langlois, a newcomer from Morganza.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
