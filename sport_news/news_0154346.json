The halfway mark of the 2015 campaign has passed and programs are beginning to find their form.Roswell continues its push for the top program in Class 6A with an undefeated mark of 6-0 on the season. The Hornets’ offense has averaged over 46 points a contest while the defense has given up only 46 points in total this year.Last Friday, Roswell defeated Wheeler 45-7 in Marietta. The Hornets dominated from the start, holding a 42-0 lead at halftime. Sheldon Evans rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown for Roswell while Quintarius Neely completed nine passes for 167 yards and three touchdowns.“The kids practiced well and executed a good game plan the coaches put in,” Hornets’ coach John Ford said.Roswell returns to action this Friday at home against Pope. The Hornets hold a 16-3 series lead over the Greyhounds, winning the past 10 contests including last year’s 44-21 victory. Pope is winless this season.“Pope runs a spread offense and coach (Kyle) Adkins has a lot of knowledge,” Ford said. “They can hurt you with the big play or the screen.”Blessed Trinity is also undefeated this season and one of the top teams in Class 3A. The Titans’ offense scored a season-high 46 points in its win over Therrell last Friday. It was the fifth-straight game this season its has scored 20 or more points.

Defensive tackle Shane Parton had three sacks.“Therrell came into the game with a lot of momentum after beating Westminster the week before and actually had a 7 - 3 lead late in the first quarter,” Titans’ coach Tim McFarlin said. “Our defense played its best game with seven sacks and our offense was able to eventually run the ball after we settled down.”The Titans themselves have Westminster this Friday. The Wildcats have a 3-3 record this season but won two of their last three contests including last week’s 49-16 victory over Decatur. Blessed Trinity has won the last four contests against Westminster but trail the lifetime series 6-5.“Westminster will bring a balanced offensive attack while defensively its one of the most well coached teams in the state,” McFarlin said.Cambridge won its third-straight game last Friday with a 42-17 home win over Sprayberry to stay undefeated in Region 7 play. JD White ran for 215 yards and had four touchdowns including a punt return.Every win is a good win and our kids deserve all the credit,” Cambridge coach Craig Bennett said.The Bears will visit Atlanta this Friday and face North Springs who come into the contest 1-5 following its 48-0 loss last week to Riverwood. Cambridge has won all three lifetime meetings against North Springs including last year’s 64-7 victory.“North Springs have some really good players and are looking for a win,” Bennett said.Centennial brings a three-game winning streak into its home contest against Habersham Central on Friday. The Knights earned a 38-35 road win at Alpharetta last week.“The kids have put in a lot of work since February and kept the faith in what we’re doing and buying in,” Centennial coach Lenny Gregory said.

Quarterback Reid Martin had two touchdowns while Kyle Brnovich hit a 42-yard field goal in the victory.“Defensively we had a great night and created turnovers,” Tigers’ coach Jeff Pickren said.St. Francis dropped its contest last week to Pinecrest Central 49-13. King’s Ridge holds the 4-1 lifetime series lead over St. Francis but lost last year’s contest 25-13.Other matchups of note this Friday include Alpharetta hosting Chattahoochee, Milton visiting Cherokee, Fellowship Christian hosting Whitefield Academy and Mount Pisgah visiting Pinecrest Academy in Cumming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:42:51.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
