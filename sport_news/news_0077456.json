He didn't appear in a game after a short stint with the team that began with him competing for a starting job. \nSan Francisco (1-3) made the move Saturday ahead of Sunday night's road game against the New York Giants. Wright had yet to be active on the game-day roster. \nWright is now looking to catch on with another team, and he thanked the 49ers on Twitter for granting his release. The 28-year-old Wright played his first four seasons with San Diego before signing a one-year deal as a free agent in March. \nThe 49ers also promoted guard Andrew Tiller to the active roster from the practice squad to boost the offensive line. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:54:14.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
