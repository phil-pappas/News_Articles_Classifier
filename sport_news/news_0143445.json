It was the first time that the domestic giants had to endure this ignominy against Andhra, which meant that the former India stumper's latest stint as the Mumbai coach had started off on a disastrous note. Naturally, Pandit was left a dejected man.\n\"We're disappointed. We were looking forward to have a good start in our first game, and we had an opportunity to do so. 245 wasn't a big total. With seven batsmen in our side, we were in a position to win, but unfortunately , that responsibility wasn't there. Abhishek Nayar's run out was the turning point, but Lad could have taken up that job,\" Pandit lamented.\n\"We lacked temperament to handle that situation. The same kind of shots were repeated by not one one, but by three batsmen, when you know that there are four fielders out there in the deep. Every cricketer should know about his responsibility, and also that they can't keep repeating the same mistakes, and I hope that they don't do it again,\" he went on.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:14:48.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
