McCormack hit Hall for an 11-yard touchdown pass for a 21-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. \nJevais Harris hauled in a 32-yard scoring pass from McCormack in the second quarter, and McCormack's 2-yard touchdown run made it 35-0 at the half. McCormack tossed a touchdown in the third quarter to cap the scoring. \n\"Sean McCormack really stepped up,\" Barry said. \"And one of the things I was most proud of was, we got in a situation against Willowbrook where guys improvised a little bit, they tried to do a little bit too much, but all of our guys were able to respond and fit within the scheme [against Proviso East].\" \nSouth also dominated defensively, limiting the Pirates to no first downs and negative yardage in the game. Jon Gorney was named the defensive Player of the Game and Destin Talbert had a blocked punt to lead the defensive effort. \nThe win gives the Hornets some momentum going into a key West Suburban Gold matchup against Addison Trail. South hosts the game at 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 2. \nBoth the Blazers and Hornets sport 3-2 overall record and 2-1 marks in the WSG, and both teams have alternated wins and losses this season. South hopes to end that trend. \n\"For us it's every lesson that we've learned up this point is for this game,\" Barry said. \"We have to play hard for four quarters. We saw that against Glenbard West, we were there right into the fourth and then the wheels came off, so learned from that. Playing with discipline, we've seen along the way, that's something we have to do.\" \nSouth is the highest-scoring team in the West Suburban Gold with 171 points. AT has mustered just 89 points this season, but the Blazers have a penchant for winning close games. They started the season with a 19-14 win against Glenbard South, won 28-26 against Willowbrook when the Warriors missed a last-second field goal, and hung on for a 14-13 win against Leyden on Sept. 25. \nThe Hornets have scored more than 40 points per game in their wins against Romeoville, Downers Grove South and Proviso East. They are preparing for this to be one of the toughest games of the season. \n\"Anytime we play Addison Trail we expect a dogfight, that's kind of the way it is,\" Barry said. \"Last year it came down to fourth-and-1 for us and we didn't convert. They've shown they've been able to win the close games this year, so we want to be able to put our best foot forward for four quarters.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:45:35.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
