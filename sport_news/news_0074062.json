Phillips Field. Shibley caught four passes for 76 yards and a touchdown and also returned an interception 60 yards for another score, and Weinberg completed 14 of 26 passes for 240 yards as the shorthanded Grizzlies improved to 5-0 and, along with eighth-ranked Crater’s win over Marist, set up a monster MWL collision with the Comets next Friday in Central Point. “It’s kind of a renewed rivalry of sorts,” Ashland head coach Charlie Hall said. “We kind of snuck one by them last year with that big trick play at the end of the game. It’s going to be a fun game. It’s an epic battle, from a conference standpoint, from a rival standpoint. It’s our equivalent to the civil war … and we’re just excited to be part of that.” Down four injured starters, including game-breakers Tucker Atteberry (quarterback) and Michael Pruitt (TE/OL), Ashland spun its wheels in the early going before Shibley electrified the crowd by stepping in front of Jacob Brothers’ pass to Lucas Schwin and racing to the end zone. It was one of three interceptions by the Grizz defense, which also forced two fumbles (recovering one) and had three sacks. The Grizzlies added two quick touchdowns late in the first half sandwiched around a fumbled kickoff return by the Lancers (3-2). Weinberg connected with Shibley from 14 yards out for the first, and less than 20 seconds later Weinberg hit brother Nicky Weinberg with a 39-yard touchdown pass. Churchill tried to make a game of it early in the second half, completing a 68-yard touchdown drive on its first possession of the third quarter. But the Grizzlies answered with a 68-yard drive of their own and scored again early in the fourth to bury the visitors. Nicky Weinberg hauled in the second of those TDs, and Malik Pippa had a 22-yard touchdown reception and a 31-yard touchdown run. “They’re pretty aggressive so we took advantage of some of their aggressiveness,” Hall said. “They had some trick plays, I guess you could so, so we took advantage of that and got a good jump on them. “Hats off to the kids that came in and played in those starting roles who were backups (last week).” Hall said his team had the right focus heading into the game. “The kids just sort of had this calm confidence,” he said. “I was really worried about that in the pregame, but the way things ended up in the first half there I knew that they were ready and just kind of had to finish the job.” Prep Volleyball Ashland took a set but couldn’t push Marist to five as the visiting Spartans edged the Grizzlies in a Midwestern League clash, 25-23, 25-19, 23-25, 25-17, Friday at Mountain Avenue Gym. Ellie Case, a senior hitter, posted 13 kills, five blocks and three aces to lead the Grizzlies, while senior setter Karlie Richardson dished out 25 assists. Also for Ashland, Alex Crane provided five kills and Myla Norvell had 10 digs and four aces. The win gave Marist (15-2, 7-0 MWL) a two-match lead over the second-place Grizzlies (12-5, 5-2) in the league standings. Ashland next hosts Crater on Tuesday. Women’s Volleyball At Caldwell, Idaho, College of Idaho handed eighth-ranked Southern Oregon its first loss of the season, 17-25, 25-17, 25-18, 25-23, on Friday. The loss dropped the Raiders to 15-1 overall and 8-1 in the Cascade Conference. College of Idaho improved to 9-8 and 7-2. Emma Gasman and Tyana Andrews had 13 kills apiece for the Raiders, and Laura Morse added seven kills and 10 digs. Women’s Soccer Megan Kapp scored two goals and Southern Oregon had its best offensive performance in a Cascade Conference match in eight seasons in a 5-1 win over Warner Pacific on Friday at Raider Stadium. Allyson Ward, Kelsey Randall and Lisa Elledge also scored goals for SOU, which improved to 4-6-2 overall and 3-2 in the CCC. Warner Pacific fell to 1-6-3 and 0-4-1. Men’s Soccer Warner Pacific cashed in on an early red card en route to a 4-1 win over Southern Oregon on Friday in Cascade Conference action at Raider Stadium. Following the 14th-minute red card, Warner Pac’s Duran Hererra booted a 30-yard free kick that was redirected into the net by Mario Guizar. Diego Buenrostro scored an equalizer for the Raiders (8-4, 3-4 CCC) early in the second half, but Warner Pacific scored three goals in the final 38 minutes.
