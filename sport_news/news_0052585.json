Here are the results of Week 6 of KSL's College Football Pick'em. \nKSL.com user L. Hutchings (BYU fan base) took the top spot in Week 6 with 197 points out of a possible 250. \nHutchings' best picks were BYU 42, East Carolina 35 (47 points) and Utah 28, Cal 24 (48 points). By finishing with the most points in Week 6, Hutchings will receive a $30 Wells Fargo Visa gift card. \nConsensus picks were a perfect 5-0 (prediction, actual): Utah vs. Cal (33-24, 30-24); BYU vs. East Carolina (31-21, 45-38); Florida State vs. Miami (30-21, 29-24); Michigan vs. Northwestern (25-19, 38-0); and Fresno State vs. Utah State (16-28, 14-56). \nBYU fans were the most accurate in Week 6, taking the top 5 spots in the weekly leaderboard. The Cougar fan base correctly picked 90 percent of the games, edging out the Utah State fan base with an average score of 27.5 to 27.4. Utah fans scored an average of 27.0 points per game. \nThe Utah fan base had the most optimism, with 98.7 percent of fans picking the Utes to beat Cal. Utah State had 97.9 percent picking the Aggies to beat Fresno State, and BYU had 96.2 percent of fans picking the Cougars to beat East Carolina. \nFor those following the KSL Sports group, Andy Larsen had most points with 179, enough to edge out Josh Furlong out of the top overall spot. \nHere is the schedule of games for Week 7: BYU (4-2) vs. Cincinnati (3-2); Utah State (3-2) vs. No. 21 Boise State (5-1); No. 6 LSU (5-0) vs. No. 8 Florida (6-0); No. 14 Notre Dame (5-1) vs. USC (3-2); and No. 4 Utah (5-0) vs. Arizona State (4-2). \nWe are excited to announce that we are partnering with RC Willey to give away a 4K TV as part of KSL College Football Pick'em. More details on the TV to be released in our predictions article later in the week, but the winner will be the user with the most points of their top seven weekly scores combined. That's right, even if you had a down week or were late to join in on the game, you are still in the mix to win. \nTo play KSL College Football Pick'em, click HERE .
