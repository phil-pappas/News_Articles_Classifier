And that’s the only way we’re going to win the game, if we go in there and attack them.” \nTeams: \nNew Zealand: 1-Tony Woodcock, 2-Dane Coles, 3-Owen Franks, 4-Luke Romano, 5-Sam Whitelock, 6-Jerome Kaino, 7-Sam Cane, 8-Kieran Read (captain); 9-Aaron Smith, 10-Daniel Carter, 11-Waisake Naholo, 12-Ma’a Nonu, 13-Conrad Smith, 14-Nehe Milner-Skudder, 15-Ben Smith \nReplacements: 16-Keven Mealamu, 17-Wyatt Crockett, 18-Ben Franks, 19-Brodie Retallick, 20-Liam Messam, 21-Tawera Kerr-Barlow, 22-Beauden Barrett, 23-Sonny Bill Williams \nTonga: 1-Soane Tonga’uiha, 2-Elvis Taione, 3-Halani Aulika, 4-Tukulua Lokotui, 5-Joseph Tuineau, 6-Sione Kalamafoni, 7-Nili Latu (captain), 8-Viliami Ma’afu; 9-Sonatane Takulua, 10-Kurt Morath, 11-Fetu’u Vainikolo, 12-Latiume Fosita, 13-Siale Piutau, 14-Telusa Veainu, 15-Vungakoto Lilo \nReplacements: 16-Paula Ngauamo, 17-Sona Taumalolo, 18-Sila Puafisi, 19-Sitiveni Mafi, 20-Jack Ram, 21-Samisoni Fisilau, 22- Viliami Tahitua, 23-Will Helu \nReferee: John Lacey (Ireland)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:02:21.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
