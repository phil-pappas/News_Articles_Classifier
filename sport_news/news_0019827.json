Platini has denied any wrongdoing and appealed the Ethics Committee decision.\nPlatini is standing in the FIFA presidential election due to be held on Feb 26, although the ban could severely hamper his chances of passing an integrity test which is part of the electoral process.\n“We agreed to support Platini and to the statement issued by UEFA,” the source, from a UEFA national association, who did not wish to be named because he was not authorised to discuss the meeting’s discussions told Reuters.\n“But we will decide next week on whether to back a European candidate in the election,” he added, saying that there were several options as alternatives to Platini.\n(Reporting by Simon Evans; editing by Ralph Boulton )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:35:04.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
