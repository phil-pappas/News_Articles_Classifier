Comment   Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 9:50 PM By Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 9:50 PM ST. JAMES, Mo. The St. James High School football team has one more week to prepare for the upcoming Missouri Class 3 District 3 Tournament, and the Tigers will do it at home. St. James hosts Pacific in Four Rivers Conference play today. Kickoff at the St. James Multi-Turf Field is set for 7 p.m. It will be St. James Senior Night. The Tigers come in with a 2-6 overall and 1-4 FRC record while the Pacific Indians are 2-6 and 2-3. Last week St. James suffered a 42-12 Homecoming Game loss to Union while Pacific surprised Hermann - state-ranked just a couple of weeks ago - 40-34. Currently St. James is sixth in the eight-team Class 3 District 3 standings. If the standings do not change after this week, St. James will be playing at Salem next week in the first round of the district tourney. St. James, hit hard by injuries in recent weeks, continues to tweak the lineup. Senior QB Brett Karnes is out for the season with a knee injury while junior defensive end Trenton Ruddy (knee) missed the Union game and is questionable for this week, as is senior defensive lineman Alex Harrop (foot). And sophomore lineman Drake Ortiz is probable after suffering a spider bite which caused his leg to swell. “We’re going into it personnel-wise still adjusting due to injuries,” said Tiger head coach Greg Harlan. Harlan feels his team can get on a roll and end the regular season with a win. “That’s been the story of our conference this year - any team is able to beat any other team at any time,” Harlan said. “Last week Pacific beat Hermann. Pacific is doing some things pretty well right now. “I do feel it’s a game we can win if we play well. Against Union I felt it was the first game this season that we didn’t give ourselves a chance to win.” Pacific is starting to warm up, scoring 30 or more points in three of its last four games. The Indians’ spread offense features a balanced attack led by senior quarterback quarterback Macke Meadows. Meadows has connected on 92-of-152 passes for 887 yards, six interceptions and nine touchdowns while rushing for 605 yards and eight TDs. Senior running back Ashton Moore has rushed for 251 yards on 65 carries. The top Indian receiver is sophomore wideout Matt Strong with 29 receptions for 278 yards and four TDs while senior wideout Lucas Zurliene has 22 catches for 255 yards and two TDs and senior wideout Lane Smith 17 catches for 151 yards. Defensively senior lineman Tyler Greer leads the Indian charge with 52 solo tackles,17 assists and three QB sacks while Moore, a linebacker, has 37 solos and 13 assists and senior lineman Devon Moultrie has 35 solos, 12 assists and seven sacks. Page 2 of 2 - “They run the football real well,” Harlan said of Pacific. “They run a spread-option. They have a nice-sized running back and the quarterback is a good runner. It will be a good game for us.” For St. James Karnes’ replacement at quarterback, sophomore Ryan Harlan, has hit on 32-of-53 passes for 372 yards, seven interceptions and two touchdowns so far. Harlan was the team’s top receiver before the switch with 35 receptions for 440 yards and has also rushed for 198 yards. He has scored a total of 10 touchdowns to lead the squad. Also for the Tigers junior running back Dawson Lynch has 525 rushing yards on 101 attempts and five TDs while sophomore running back Gunnar Seams has 101 yards and two TDs. Lynch has caught 30 passes for 370 yards and four TDs while senior wideout Michael Phillips has caught 22 passes for 470 yards and six TDs; senior wideout Tyler Glidden 19 catches for 196 yards, and senior tight end Thomas Casto 14 receptions for 176 yards and three TDs. For the Tiger defense senior linebacker Justin Taft has 34 solo tackles and 21 assists while junior defense back Luke Bartle has 37 solos and 16 assists; Ortiz 33 solos and 19 assists; senior linebacker Gage Melton 39 solos and 10 assists; senior defensive back Tyler Conway 35 solos and 13 assists; Ruddy 29 and 17 with three sacks, and senior lineman Sam Williams 35 and nine.
