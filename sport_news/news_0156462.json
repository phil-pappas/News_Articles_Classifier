The Jets have scored six goals in the middle period this season.\nJiri Tlusty scored for the Devils in his debut. It was actually an own goal that Winnipeg defenseman Jacob Trouba fired into his own net trying to clear a puck in front.\nCory Schneider made 27 saves for the Devils, who have missed the playoffs the past three seasons.\nThe 40-year-old Hynes is the NHL’s youngest coach.\nWinnipeg, which beat Boston 6-2 on Thursday night, dominated after being outshot 3-0 in the opening minute.\nScheifele, who got the Jets’ first goal against the Bruins, got them started again with a shot from the left circle at 1:13. The puck seemed to fool Schneider and might have been deflected by Devils defenseman David Schlemko.\nLess than 3 minutes later, Wheeler snapped a shot past Schneider from the dot in the same circle. The goal was waved off by one of the referees, but replay clearly showed it hitting the back of the net. Even Schneider knew it.\nTlusty — with Trouba’s assistance, cut the lead to a goal at 12:53, but Ladd beat Schneider from the right circle off a nice cross-ice pass by Perreault.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under john hynes ,  new jersey devils", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:47:42.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
