They coined the acronym VUCA as a shorthand way of referring to this environment: Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous.\n“After the tragedy of September 11, the college informally changed its name to VUCA University, signaling its realization that these were going to be long-term descriptors for the future realities that military leaders would face for some time to come,” says Tom O’Shea, the books coauthor. “Since that time, VUCA has become increasingly well-known and adopted as the descriptor for the challenging internal and external environments that all organizations face today and will face with even greater intensity in the future.”\nEach of the VUCA factors contributes significantly to the turbo turbulence in the operating context for leaders. Corporate leaders face the VUCA world every day.\n“Confident, agile organizations and leaders need to be skillful guides able to convert the external negative energy into positive internal energy cascading down through the organization creating confidence and success by becoming more focused, fast and flexible,” says Horney.\nThe frenzy of innovation is the hallmark of the 21st century, a century driven by the continuing digital revolution, rapidly expanding interconnectivity and intensifying global competition with radically evolving consumer expectations and dynamics. The book contends an era of turbo turbulence is upon us, with increasingly vexing turmoil coming at us at increasing speed.\nO’Shea says “There are fundamental questions that leave survival hanging in the balance: How will organizations deal with such an environment? What will be the impact dynamic on your enterprise and how will you respond as a leader?” The clear answer, contends the book, is that you and your organization must become agile—focused, fast, and flexible—where people, processes, and technology continuously adapt to changing conditions.\n“This capability will enable you to continually anticipate, monitor, and adjust to trends and the new dynamics, so you and your enterprise not only survive but thrive,” says Horney. “There is a rapidly growing understanding by CEOs and senior leaders around the globe regarding the need for organizational agility, and many leaders have already attempted to promote it in their organizations in some form or fashion.”\nHere is what other respected leaders have to say about Focused, Fast & Flexible book:\n“The VUCA world of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity is upon us – whether we like it or not. This book lays out the roadmap for surviving and prospering in these dynamic and challenging times.” Bob Seelert, Chairman Emeritus, Saatchi & Saatchi\n\"Tom and Nick helped prepare and mobilize our team for what lies around the corner – change and transformation at lightning speed. The Agile Model helped our managers see the world through the lens of opportunity – to anticipate what truly is around the next bend and to create resiliency for the challenges aheadand winning in the marketplace.” Mark Nelson, President, ARAMARK Higher Education\nAuthors Horney and O'Shea offer a widely acclaimed best-practices approach built around their trademarked The Agile Model® developed in the course of more than 15 years of dedicated study on the drivers and dynamics in creating enterprise agility working with dozens of organizations and thousands of leaders.
