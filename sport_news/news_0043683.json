Diggs had six catches for 87 yards in NFL debut at Denver against one of league’s best defenses. \n___ \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:11:11.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
