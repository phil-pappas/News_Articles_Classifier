He returned it 38 yards to lift the Spartans to a startling 27-23 victory.\nHe didn't have much chance to celebrate. The Spartans' redshirt freshman appeared to land hard on his left hip after he was tackled into the end zone by Michigan tight end Jake Butt.\nJoyous teammates jumped on Watts-Jackson as he lay on a maize \"M\" in the end zone. He was carted off the field and hospitalized.\nPLEA TO FANS: Michigan's athletic director released an open letter urging fans to avoid \"thoughtless comments\" after the punting mistake.\nJim Hackett does not mention O'Neill by name, but it is clear he is concerned about what O'Neill might face on social media.\nIn his letter Sunday, Hackett writes of the \"shocking reality\" that the Michigan community would send \"hurtful, spiteful and vicious comments\" to one of its students. He says such remarks from a \"small minority\" do not reflect the university.\nAMERICAN UPRISING: Memphis and Temple jumped into The Associated Press poll for the first time this season, joining Houston to give the American Athletic Conference three ranked teams for the first time in the history of the 3-year-old league.\nOhio State remained No. 1 in the AP Top 25 released Sunday. For the second straight week, six teams received first-place votes in the media poll, led by the Buckeyes with 28. No. 2 Baylor has 12, No. 3 Utah received 16, No. 4 TCU got three and No. 5 LSU and No. 6 Clemson each have one.\nThe Utes and LSU Tigers each edged ahead one spot after home victories on Saturday.\nMichigan State stayed at No. 7 after its miracle against Michigan and Alabama is No. 8 after handing Texas A&M its first loss.\nMemphis (6-0) had the big upset of the weekend against Mississippi.\nMIAMI LOSES CAPTAIN: Miami lost leading tackler Raphael Kirby, for the remainder of the season with a right knee injury.\nThe senior linebacker and captain was injured in the Hurricanes' 30-20 win over Virginia Tech on Saturday. He is the third Miami linebacker lost this season, joining Darrion Owens (knee) and Marques Gayot (neck) and leaving the Hurricanes extremely thin at that position.\nKirby had a team-best 44 tackles this season for Miami, and had made 19 consecutive starts going back to the beginning of the 2014 season. He was also a preseason candidate for the Butkus Award, which will be given to the nation's top linebacker.\nIRISH GUARD OUT: Notre Dame guard Alex Bars is out for the season after fracturing his left ankle against Southern California.\nCoach Brian Kelly said during a conference call Sunday the 6-foot-6, 320-pound sophomore will have surgery. Bars was hurt midway through the second quarter. USC defensive tackle Delvon Simmons was blocked into Bars' leg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:36.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
