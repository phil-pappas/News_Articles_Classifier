The FWC course satisfies hunter-safety training requirements for all other states as well. \nStudents must complete the internet course available at myfwc.com before attending this class and will need to bring a copy of the final report. \nInstruction will be held Oct. 15 from 6 to 10 p.m. at the Molino Community Center located off Highway 95A. The final step to complete the course is the gun range portion that will be Oct. 17 from 7 to 10 a.m. \nPeople interested in attending this course can register online at myfwc.com/huntersafety or by calling hunter safety coordinator Will Burnett at 265-3676.
