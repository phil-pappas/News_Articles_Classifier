(AP) â€” Missouri's House speaker is gathering signatures for a letter to Gov. Jay Nixon that slams a plan to use state money for a new St. Louis football stadium.\nA letter from Speaker Todd Richardson obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press urges Nixon and leaders of a stadium task force to work with lawmakers.\nA Nixon spokesman says he hasn't seen Richardson's letter and declined comment.\nRichardson is the latest of several lawmakers to speak against using taxpayer money for a stadium without legislative or voter approval.\nNixon is working with St. Louis officials on a stadium plan aimed at keeping the Rams in the city. Early estimates call for hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars for bond payments.\nBut lack of legislative support could cast doubts on the project's finances.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
