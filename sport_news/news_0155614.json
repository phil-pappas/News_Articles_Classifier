COURTESY SWAN LAND COMPANY\nThe Land of Enchantment may no longer be able to claim one of its most famous residents.\nTwo-time winner of Academy Awards for best actress, Jane Fonda sold her northern New Mexico ranch Wednesday to an undisclosed buyer for an undisclosed price.\nThe listed price for the Forked Lightning Ranch, located about 25 miles east of Santa Fe, was $19.5 million.\nThe selling broker on the deal, Mike Swan of Swan Land Co. in Bozeman, Mont., said he was unable to confirm the selling price due to a confidentiality agreement and that the buyer wished to remain anonymous.\nSwan did say the buyer was someone local with New Mexico ties.\nThe 2,300-acre ranch was put up for sale in June of last year. At that time, Fonda, now 77, said changes in her life prevented her from spending as much time on the ranch as she formerly did.\n“I feel the time has come to pass the ranch on to a new custodian of this enchanted place,” she said.\nFonda bought the ranch in 2000 shortly before her divorce to media mogul Ted Turner.\n“It’s where I healed after my marriage — it’s where I came to understand my life so far,” Fonda, who wrote her 2005 memoir “My Life So Far” while living at the ranch, told Architectural Digest in 2014.\nFonda said she did a lot of fly-fishing while married to Turner and knew she’d miss it. “And here I was looking at land along a trout river,” she said. “The moment I stepped on the property I knew I was home — its sheer beauty made my hair stand on end.”\nAbout 3.5 miles of the Pecos River flows through the property that is bordered by the Santa Fe National Forest to the east and the Pecos National Historical Park to the north. The property also includes miles of hiking and horse trails.\nAt least part of the property was previously owned by Texas oil tycoon Buddy Fogelson and his wife Greer Garson, who like Fonda was a film actress. In the 1960s the couple built a hacienda and barn designed by the famous Santa Fe architect John Gaw Meem in his signature Pueblo Revival style.\nWhen Fonda bought the property she oversaw the reconstruction of the hacienda into a 9,600-square-foot dwelling, and renovation of the barn into a 12-stall equestrian facility with an adjoining paddock while she was living in a two-bedroom log cabin on the property.\nSwan said the property drew a lot in interest from potential buyers.\n“It did get a lot of visibility because it was such an iconic piece of New Mexico history,” he said.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.swanlandco.com/properties/forked-lightning-ranch", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/web_1_flr.jpg", "http://www.swanlandco.com/properties/forked-lightning-ranch"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:44:11.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
