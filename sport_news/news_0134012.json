The kind of crisis that hit the country during that period had tempered the Indian democracy which came out stronger. I am grateful to those who struggled and fought against it,” he said. “Emergency should be remembered not to cry or brood over what had happened then, but to strengthen our resolve to fortify and further strengthen the democratic values and framework in our country,” Modi said at “Loktantra Prahari Abhinandan”, a programme organised to mark Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan’s 113th birth anniversary. Paying tributes to the Loknayak, he felicitated many of those who fought against Emergency and went to jail in 1975-76, including BJP veteran LK Advani. Earlier, the Prime Minister also visited the residences of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former NDA convener George Fernandes who had played a significant role in the fight for democracy. “The biggest message that came out of the anti-Emergency struggle was the inspiration to fight repression. So many people in politics today owe their initial days to those days of Emergency, JP Movement, Navnirman Movement ... they gave birth to a new kind of politics in the nation,” the Prime Minister said. Modi said: “We do not want to remember Emergency to criticise someone, but to constantly be reminded of commitment towards democracy and freedom of press.” — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:05:33.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
