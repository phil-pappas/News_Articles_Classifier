(Special to the Courier) Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 3:50 pm Winfield golfers are regional champions By OLIVIA HASELWOOD Courier Sports Reporter sports@winfieldcourier.com winfieldcourier.com | 0 comments Winfield golfers took on 10 teams and used their home course advantage to win regionals. Coming off the heels of winning league at Quail Ridge a week ago, the Vikings took that momentum into the regional tournament Monday at Winfield Country Club. The Vikings came away winning their second straight regional title. Abby Bertholf was the regional champion, shooting a 86. Nicole Withrow of Collegiate was second with a 98. Sadie Revell was one stroke out of second, shooting a 99. Only three girls broke 100. “It was a tough day with the high winds and Winfield Country Club is a challenging course already,” David Bertholf said. kA 4=2DDlQAbQmz6??2 q:55=6 H2D D6G6?E9 H:E9 2 `_d] pD9=6J $>:E9 H2D 6:89E9 H:E9 2 `_e] %JD92 w6??:?8 H2D ``E9 H:E9 2 ```] t>>2 w@EE:?86C H2D `cE9 H:E9 2 ``c] k^Am kA 4=2DDlQAbQm“z6??2 2?5 %JD92 92G6 366? 32EE=:?8 D@>6 :==?6DD E9C@F89 =628F6 2?5 C68:@?2=D[” q6CE9@=7 D2:5] “x H2D AC@F5 @7 E96:C 677@CE] xE 4@F=5 92G6 366? 62DJ E@ ?@E A=2J @C 8:G6 FA 2?5 E96J 5:5?’E]” k^Am kA 4=2DDlQAbQm(:?7:6=5 H@?
