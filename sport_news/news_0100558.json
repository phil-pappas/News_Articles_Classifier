By Emilio Rivera The Capital-Journal \nMANHATTAN — Kansas State’s first game against South Dakota on Sept. 5 marked an important occasion for one Wildcat player, whose journey in NCAA athletics began in a place he never thought he’d play again — home. \nJunior offensive lineman Terrale Johnson began his career with the Wildcats nearly three years after he graduated from Manhattan High School, stepping in for injured senior tackle Boston Stiverson. \nDuring his senior season with the Indians, a series of events unfolded to take him away from home and then back again. \nThe journey began with the Indians’ coach Joe Schartz, a former quarterback for Washburn University, who will be inducted into the Ichabods’ Hall of Fame on Oct. 10. \n“Schartz instilled discipline in me,” Johnson said. “When I went out to (Hutchinson), I got more freedom, there’s so many things I could’ve done out there. My freshman year, I was disciplined enough to stay focused. ‘On the field and off the field, do things right,’ that’s all (Schartz) would tell us.” \nAfter spending three seasons playing for Schartz, Johnson ran into a dilemma that is very common across the country — not being able qualify to compete at the NCAA level out of high school. \nThe First-Team All-State selection in 2011 signed with coach Rion Rhodes and the Hutchinson Community College football program. As a Blue Dragon, Johnson earned honorable mention All-Jayhawk Conference player in 2013, while being a dominant force for the team as they finished both of his seasons ranked in the top 25 and earning back-to-back Salt Bowl victories. \n“It was the same thing with coach Rhoades as it was with Schartz — do things right,” Johnson said. “Rhoades told us he knew what we could get into out there in the community, so he told us to do things right. With him, if you didn’t do things right, there would be consequences for it.” \nWhile Johnson focused on his work habits at Hutchinson, he tried to stay focused on his academics so he wouldn’t run into the same roadblock as the one he had coming out of high school. \n“Rhoades (and his staff) helped me stay focused on my grades,” Johnson said. “They preached that you had to get good grades to get out of there, and some of us were there because of grades.” \nThrough the work that Johnson put in on and off the field with the Blue Dragons, he received an unexpected call from his hometown school. \n“When coach (Dana) Dimel (K-State’s co-offensive coordinator/running backs and tight ends coach) called me and said ‘We want you to take a visit,’ it was kind of bringing me hope that I could play at home,” Johnson said. “There was not hesitation to sign the papers. I just thought it was right. People say that they want to leave Manhattan, but I couldn’t do it.” \nEven though Johnson looked forward to playing football for the Wildcats and coach Bill Snyder, they weren’t the main reason that Johnson came back to Manhattan. \n“I couldn’t leave my mom or my brothers,” Johnson said. “I felt like it was going to be a great experience anyways, being home (in Manhattan) so they can come to every game. I know that she’s always there, and that’s what I always dream of now, making my mom proud.” \nWhether it’s using the fact the he’s playing in front of his mom for motivation, or using her for emotional support, Johnson knows that his mom is always there for him through all of the ups and downs. \n“My mom called me every day regardless, but if I ever got down on myself, I could always go to her,” Johnson said. \n“Like last summer, when I was doing horrible and there were days that I felt like I wanted to quit, she would be like ‘keep doing your thing, keep working hard, make sure you pray, just make sure you work hard everyday.’” \nEven though he had made it to Manhattan and K-State, Johnson had one more hurdle to overcome— his own work ethic. \nIn his redshirt season at K-State, Johnson fell behind in his conditioning and preparations, something that stunted his growth in the system. Then Johnson realized the issues he was having, and used the team’s break in the winter after the Alamo Bowl to begin to change his mentality. \n“Starting winter with our winter conditioning and workouts, my main thing was to not drop out of the workouts, to finish,” Johnson said. “The day we got back from the bowl game break, I missed like three reps, and that day I knew that this season is going to be a good one, and I could feel that I made a stride.” \nHis focus on changing the error of his ways in preparation has caught the eye of someone in a similar situation as he is, sophomore quarterback Joe Hubener, who had to step into Jesse Ertz’s position when the junior injured his knee on the first play of the season. \n“I think the workouts caught him off guard at first, how hard we work, and he’s adapted to that,” Hubener said. “It really is a common thing, I know I didn’t expect how hard we work here, and I think that’s the way most guys see it. That first summer or that first winter — whenever they get here — they see how hard the workouts are. You just have to get that mentality and a lot of guys develop that as they play here. \n“He’s become that hard worker that you expect out of any K-State player. It’s awesome to see how far he’s come. He’s worked his tail off to get into the rotation, and he’s preforming well on Saturdays.” \nAs signs start to appear to the return of Stiverson in the upcoming weeks, Johnson’s work ethic is beginning to flourish on the field. While the future may be unknown for Johnson, one thing is for sure — he’s found his way home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:37:00.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
