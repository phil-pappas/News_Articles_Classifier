Hundreds of homes in Tuolumne County have reportedly experienced well failures over the past year due to the ongoing drought, and drilling a new one can cost tens of thousands of dollars. The Rural Community Assistance Corporation is a nonprofit organization based in Modesto that provides training, technical and financial resources for rural communities. Loan applicants must own and occupy the home being improved, or be in the process of purchasing the home. The household income may not exceed $62,883. New home construction and community water systems are not eligible. The maximum loan amount is $18,000, with an interest rate of 1 to 3 percent depending on repayment ability. Loans through the program must be repaid within 20 years. More than 330 homes served by wells in Tuolumne County have applied for temporary assistance over the past year due to drought-related well failures. The county is offering temporary water tank installations and water deliveries for homes with dry wells through funding from the California Disaster Assistance Act. Deputy County Administrator Tracie Riggs, the county Office of Emergency Services coordinator, said Tuesday that the state has provided $750,000 in funding for the assistance so far. Riggs said the funding from the state is expected to last through the end of the year, but beyond that is uncertain.
