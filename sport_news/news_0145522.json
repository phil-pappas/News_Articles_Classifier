The pass was a wobbly ball completed at the 8-yard line, but time ran out on the Hawks and Palm Bay took the W. \nROCKLEDGE 20, ASTRONAUT 7 \nIn Rockledge, the Raiders rebounded from a tough loss last week by dropping Astronaut at home. \nRunning backs Jalen Mitchell and Keith Freeman and quarterback Jacquez Lyons shouldered the load offensively for Rockledge. \nMitchell rushed for a game-high 94 yards, Freeman rushed for a touchdown and caught another, and Lyons ran for a score and threw one to Freeman. Rockledge holds on against Astronaut \nSEBASTIAN RIVER 39, BAYSIDE 9 \nIn Palm Bay, despite being beaten badly again, Bayside fought to the bitter end, scoring its lone touchdown just before the game’s clock hit zero. \nD’Andre Edwards fought his way through a group of Sebastian River defenders and into the end zone to add to the lone field goal the Bears got just before the half. \nThe Bears are still looking for their first win of the season and will try to get that win on the road next Friday, traveling to Okeechobee for another district game. \nEAU GALLIE 35, COCOA BEACH 0 \nIn Melbourne, Eau Gallie shut out Cocoa Beach, and scored five touchdowns without throwing a pass. \nTyvone Brooks led the Commodores in rushing with 14 carries for 165 yards, but Jalen Shelton wasn’t far behind with seven carries for 126 yards. \nBrooks ran in two touchdowns for Eau Gallie, with Shelton running in the other three. \nHERITAGE 44, MELBOURNE 0 \nIn Palm Bay, Heritage’s defense was smothering, leading the way for the Panthers. \nJust how stifling was their defense? The Panthers forced four turnovers, scored nine points on their own and held the Bulldogs to eight total yards in the first half. \nDaeshawn Mills led Heritage offensively with 102 yards on 12 carries and a touchdown. \nHOLY TRINITY 44, AGAPE CHRISTIAN 28 \nIn Melbourne, Holy Trinity running back Jashaun Corbin rushed for a game-high 259 yards and five touchdowns. \nThe wild win wasn’t secured until Tiger defensive tackle Andre Neuharth rumbled 12 yards with a fumble recovery for a TD with 4:47 remaining. \nAfter a season opening loss, the Tigers have reeled off five consecutive wins, thanks in large part to the exploits of Corbin. The speedy sophomore, who entered the contest leading Brevard rushers with 785 yards, scored in every quarter on TD runs of 27, 2, 1, 39 and 40 yards. \nWhile Corbin is earning a reputation for his offensive feats, it may have been his acrobatic interception in the third quarter that gave the Tigers momentum early in the second half. Corbin’s theft led to his fourth touchdown with 6:39 remaining in the third quarter. \n“It felt good; me and Joc (Perry) are having a competition to see who can get the most picks and I’m winning right now,” said Corbin. “I’ve got two, but I also have a pick-six.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:31:01.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
