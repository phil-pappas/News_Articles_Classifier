Newton has also been hit five times while throwing, tied for the most along with Matt Stafford.\n— Wilson remains at the top of pressure rate at 45.6 while Newton is middling at 32.4. Wilson’s 63.0% completion rate while under pressure is nearly 20 points higher than Newton (45.2).\n— Newton has a completion rate of only 62.7% on throws taking less than 2.5 seconds. That’s currently seventh-worst, sharing company with Michael Vick, Jameis Winston, Ryan Tannehill, and Ryan Mallett.\n— Carolina only has two run of over 15 yards on the year. Thomas Rawls, by himself, has five.\n— Carolina tight end Greg Olsen has the fourth-highest target rate among TEs when he lines up in the slot. We all saw Eifert down the seam last week and Olsen’s YPRR from the slot is up from 1.26 last year to 1.64.\n— Carolina’s offensive line has the sixth-best pass block efficiency at 82.6. Neither had monster games last week but Avril (13.6) and Bennett (12.9) are both top-3 in pass rush productivity. Michael Oher is the seventh-worst graded left tackle with a -9.8 overall. Within that is a -9.4 run blocking grade, second-worst among LTs. Will be interesting to see if Frank Clark gets more run since he predominantly lines up on the right.\n— Carolina MLB A.J. Klein has played well while Luke Kuechly has been out. His 10.7 run stop rate is 10 th among ILBs. He’s also only missed two tackles on the year (both on pass plays), giving him a 12.5 combined tackle efficiency rating. Bobby Wagner is only a 5.9 and has missed 8 tackles. Klein, though, won’t play Sunday due to injury with Kuechly expected to return after missing the last three games.\n— Carolina CB Josh Norman has been getting a lot of love this year due to an NFL-high four interceptions, and while he does have a 0.71 yards/coverage snap, Richard Sherman has a 0.68. And even with his off-performance from last week, Cary Williams is not far behind at 0.75.\n \nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
