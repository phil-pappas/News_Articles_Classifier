(AP) - Atlanta Motor Speedway is offering fans a \"perfect race weather guarantee\" for next year's NASCAR event. The 1.54-mile trioval south of Atlanta is among the tracks that already released its 2016 race dates. The Sprint Cup event is Feb. 28 - the earliest date for a Cup race at the 55-year-old track. Cold and inclement weather have been a problem at a track hurt by weak attendance. To address that, Atlanta will offer a full credit that can be applied through the 2017 NASCAR weekend if the high temperature fails to reach 50 degrees on either race day or a Feb. 27 doubleheader featuring the Truck Series and Xfinity Series. The guarantee also applies if bad weather forces a postponement of the races to a different day. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
