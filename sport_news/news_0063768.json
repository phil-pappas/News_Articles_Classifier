The 2015 Super Bowl champs are unbeaten during the 2015 season and the New York Jets see their game against the Patriots as a chance to make a statement Sunday morning (KOIN-6, (CBS), 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET) .\nThe Patriots (5-0) look unbeatable. They are averaging a league-leading 36.6 points a game and have won their games by an average margin of 16 points. They have dominated the Jets in recent seasons, winning seven of the last eight games. Quarterback Tom Brady has a 21-7 record as a starter against the Jets during his career.\nThe Jets (4-1) have usually given the Patriots a tough game. The Jets lost by a combined three points in the two games during the 2014 season. They possess a stifling defense that ranks No. 1 in total defense in the NFL and they have allowed 75 points, fewest in the league.\nThe Jets offense features a running attack that averages 146 yards a game, tops in the NFL. A time-consuming ground attack could be a key element in the game - keeping Brady and the Patriots offense off the field.\nIf you want to watch the Jets-Patriots game, here's what you need to know:\nWhat : New York Jets at New England Patriots\nWhere : Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, MA\nWhen : Sunday, Oct. 25, 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET\nTV : KOIN-6 (CBS)\nWatch online : You can watch a live stream online on DirecTV's live stream package.\n-- Geoffrey C.
