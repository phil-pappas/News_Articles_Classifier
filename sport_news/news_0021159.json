They're on track for really good years. You hate to see that.\"\nJohnson was practicing at both receiver and safety. \nListed at 6 feet and 185 pounds, he caught eight passes for 41 yards in the first three games before the switch.\nLast season, he caught 23 passes for 232 yards and one touchdown, a 15-yarder from Brett Hundley in a November win at Washington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:31:47.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
