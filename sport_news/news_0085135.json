He spent the past four seasons with the Giants and was part of the Super Bowl-winning team that beat the Patriots in February 2012. \nHe was released by the Giants before this season and hasn’t played since. The 32-year-old Weatherford posted a photo Saturday on Instagram with him, Darrelle Revis and Eric Decker at the Jets’ facility, announcing: “I’m b ck!!!!” \nQuigley had not appeared on the Jets’ injury report all week, but took a hard shot on a blocked punt against Washington last Sunday. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:28:59.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
