This is the right thing to do,\" McClendon said.\nHisashi Iwakuma will start Friday, Roenis Elias on Saturday and Vidal Nuno will pitch the season finale Sunday. Hernandez was told of the decision on Tuesday night then met with McClendon and new Seattle general manager Jerry Dipoto on Wednesday.\nMcClendon said he would have changed his thinking if the Mariners were facing a team that was in a playoff chase or Hernandez had a chance for a career-best 20th victory. Hernandez missed out on win No. 19 last Saturday against the Los Angeles Angels.\nHernandez will finish the season with an 18-9 record and 3.53 ERA. Hernandez said his pitching arm is fine. Seattle also shut down young right-hander Taijuan Walker early. Walker started 29 games and was 11-8 with a 4.56 ERA.\n\"Much like with Walker, has it cost us a game or two this year? Probably so, but the future of this organization is much bigger than one or two games,\" McClendon said.\nOne of the disappointments for Hernandez is not continuing his streak of pitching at least 200 innings and having 200 strikeouts. Hernandez had reached the 200/200 mark in six straight seasons, tied for the third-longest streak in baseball history. Hernandez will finish the year with 201 2-3 innings pitching but 191 strikeouts.\nHernandez said he was too inconsistent this season and watched all of his bad starts where he noticed mechanical differences from his better outings.\n\"Up and down, not consistent. I'm not happy with what I did this year,\" Hernandez said. \"I've got to prepare myself for next year now and do better.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:01:18.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
