Despite the quarterback's struggles, wide receiver Sammy Watkins expects big things out of him against the Bengals, according to Tyler Dunne of the Buffalo News :\nWatkins on EJ Manuel: \"I think this game he's going to come in and light it up. ... He's going to have a monster game.\"\n— Tyler Dunne (@TyDunne) October 14, 2015 Also, Manuel expressed his excitement regarding a potential start while taking first-team practice reps over the course of the week, per Chris Brown of the team's official site.\n\"Very eager to see what happens for Sunday,\" he said. \"I definitely feel confident in what I can do. I think my teammates feel the same way. Obviously Tyrod is going to try his best to go out there and play, but if he doesn't, just go out there and help our team win.\"\nManuel will have an extremely tough test in his return to the lineup, as he will face a 5-0 Bengals team that is allowing just 20.2 points per game this season.\nHelp is on the way, however, as running back LeSean McCoy is probable after missing two games with a hamstring injury . Also, Watkins could return from a calf ailment that cost him two contests.\nPlaying Cincinnati without Taylor's services is far from ideal from Buffalo's perspective, but if McCoy can help establish the running game and the Bills' super-talented defense holds Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton in check, then Buffalo has a legitimate shot to pull off the upset.\nFollow @MikeChiari on Twitter.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000536885/article/cowboys-trade-for-bills-qb-matt-cassel", "http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-2/Tyrod-Taylor-to-be-a-game-time-decision/95fc6036-fa4a-4164-8f0d-9f353f157e40", "http://espn.go.com/blog/buffalo-bills/post/_/id/21496/bills-sammy-watkins-on-calf-injury-if-it-pops-it-pops", "http://bleacherreport.com/andy-dalton", "http://bleacherreport.com/", "https://twitter.com/BobHoltzmanESPN/status/655454804161003520", "https://twitter.com/JasonLaCanfora/status/653997536882073600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/MikeChiari", "https://twitter.com/TyDunne/status/654373357836742656", "http://bleacherreport.com/rex-ryan", "http://bleacherreport.com/ej-manuel", "https://twitter.com/AlbertBreer/status/655473053284081664", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25327184/report-lesean-mccoy-has-new-tear-in-hamstring-could-miss-3-4-weeks"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:27:42.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
