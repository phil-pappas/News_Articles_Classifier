FIELD HOCKEY York 2, Kennebunk 1 KENNEBUNK, Maine — The defending Class B champion Wildcats (14-0) capped their second straight perfect season, and they did it with some late-game heroics. Working off a penalty corner with under 3 minutes to play, York’s Sydney Bouchard kept the ball in at the right side of the circle and fired a shot toward the cage. Teammate Alie Jones took a swing at the ball as it trickled past the goalie and across the goalmouth, and Izzy Bretz was home on the weak side to knock in the game-winner. The Wildcats took a 1-0 lead into halftime after Jones scored off an assist from Bretz. Kennebunk (9-3-1) scored an equalizer early in the second half and the teams remained deadlocked until Bretz’s goal with about 2:30 remaining. York will be the top seed in the upcoming Southern Maine Class B regional tournament.

GOLF Quinn falls short in repeat bid In the final round of the Division I golf championship at Hanover Country Club, Winnacunnet’s Ryan Quinn saw his quest for a repeat title stopped by Bishop Guertin’s Tom Ethier, who rallied after starting the day six shots off the lead. Quinn — who was masterful on Thursday, carding a 70 for low medalist honors — shot an 80 Saturday and finished four strokes back. Ethier captured the title after winning a playoff hole against past champion Brandon Gillis. Quinn finished fourth overall.
