The sophomore defensive back reversed field and turned down the Yellow Jackets’ sideline with a caravan of teammates in front of him. \nAustin weaved his way in and out of FSU blockers turned tacklers, dodging tackles from holder Cason Beatty and then Aguayo, who unsuccessfully grasped at Austin before he made scrambled into the end zone for a 78-yard score. \n“In football, anything can happen,” FSU coach Jimbo Fisher said. “They couldn’t catch him, didn’t know where he was at.” \nFisher added FSU regularly practices for that scenario. \nThe loss ended the Seminoles’ conference win streak at 28 games, one shy of tying the record set by FSU from 1992-95. \nFlorida State’s offense managed just 280 yards on 55 plays against a defense that was surrendering an average of 370 yards per game entering the contest. \nFSU failed to gain separation early, squandering several opportunities to force the run-heavy Yellow Jackets to become one-dimensional and throw the ball more frequently. The Seminoles came up with two interceptions in the first half and scored 10 points indirectly off the takeaways – including a two-yard touchdown run by back Dalvin Cook – but couldn’t sustain drives. \nThe Seminoles scored just one touchdown inside the red zone and came away empty in their final trip deep into Georgia Tech territory. \nUp 16-13 midway through the fourth quarter, FSU marched down the field on a nine-play, 64-yard drive that ate up 5:52 to spell its winded defense. \nOn third down, Everett Golson zipped a pass to receiver Travis Rudolph at the back of the end zone. Fisher said the throw should’ve been slightly higher and it appeared a defender got his hand on the ball. Jamal Golden came away from the scrum with an interception, Golson’s first in 201 passing attempts this season. \nGeorgia Tech chewed up clock in the second half, putting together two consecutive drives that encompassed more than 6:30 to begin the third period. \n“We didn’t have the ball [much,] we didn’t have a rhythm in offense,” Fisher said. “We can’t go out there and fool around. When we get in the red zone, we have to score. We didn’t do it.” \nFSU had its chance to put the Yellow Jackets away after the turnover. Facing fourth and six, Georgia Tech quarterback Justin Thomas completed a 36-yard pass to Brad Stewart over safety Derwin James. Kicker Harrison Butker connected on a 35-yard field goal with 54 seconds remaining to tie the game at 16-16. \nThe Seminoles put together a potential game-winning drive, crossing midfield to Georgia Tech’s 43 with 20 seconds left when Golson Golson connected with Cook for a 22-yard gain on a delayed screen pass. \nFSU eventually got to the 38-yard line to set up a makeable field goal for Aguayo, one of the most accomplished kickers in NCAA history. \n“It’s the first time it’s been blocked in my career at Florida State,” Aguayo said. “I thought I hit it well. We don’t know where it would’ve went. It’s just unfortunate.” \nWhile the Yellow Jackets continued to celebrate, the stunned Seminoles focused on regrouping before hosting Syracuse and hitting the road for a major challenge at No. 6 Clemson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:29:36.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
