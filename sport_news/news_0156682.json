Baer-USA TODAY Sports Posted: Friday, October 2, 2015 8:06 pm | Updated: 10:27 pm, Fri Oct 2, 2015. \nHarold Landry doesn't like to disappoint. \n\"I'm not the type to let anybody down,\" Landry said earlier this week. \nSo, when the football coaches at Boston College began talking last spring about the high expectations they had for Landry for 2015, the sophomore defensive end dedicated the summer to an intense training regimen to prepare. \nThe results have seen the Pine Forest High School graduate emerge as one of the Atlantic Coast Conference's top defenders through the first four games. Landry is tied for the ACC lead in tackles for loss (8.0), is tied for fourth in sacks (3.0) and has 21 tackles overall as Boston College (3-1, 0-1) plays Duke (3-1, 1-0) in a 3:30 p.m. league matchup in Durham today. \n\"I think he's really helped us in our pass rush,\" Boston College coach Steve Addazio said. \"Last year, we did not have a very good four-man pass rush. We had to create a pass rush with blitzes. We still blitz, but we can also create a four-man pass rush with Harold off the edge. \n\"He's more physically mature. He's mentally more mature and he's just starting to come into his own. We're starting to feel the benefit of that right now.\" \nThe Eagles saw Landry's potential as a true freshman when he appeared in 13 games as a reserve, making 11 tackles. The experience made the former All-Cape Fear region tight end realize how much he needed to improve his athleticism to take on an expanded role as a sophomore. \nLandry went to work, spending each morning during the summer training before classes in the afternoon. He eventually lost 12 pounds, dropping his weight to about 245 on his 6-foot-3 frame. \n\"Here, we don't just do things that make you the world's strongest man,\" Landry said. \"Our strength and conditioning program is geared to make you a better football player overall. I pretty much dedicated my whole offseason to football. It helped me become more explosive and a better overall athlete.\" \nShining moment \nThe entire nation had the chance to witness the improvement Sept. 18 when Boston College played No. 9 Florida State at home. Landry produced 11 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 quarterback sacks in a 14-0 loss in a performance that earned him ACC Defensive Lineman of the Week honors. \nTrue to his competitive nature, Landry would have traded the honor for a win. But he appreciated the attention received from the effort. \n\"I appreciated all the congratulations, but at the end we didn't win and that was the ultimate goal,\" he said. \"It (player of week honor) surprised me. There's a lot of great talent on defense in the ACC, so I appreciate the award and I'm proud of it. \n\"I really have to thank our defensive line coach, coach (Ben) Albert. He really pushes me hard every day in practice because he knows what I'm capable of and he won't let me become complacent.\" \nLandry hopes to continue his strong play today against a Duke program he considered playing for while being recruited at Pine Forest. \n\"I actually visited Duke and they offered me during the visit,\" Landry said. \"The same day I left Duke and went to Boston College. I just loved everything about it and committed right there.\" \nLandry will have special incentive against the Blue Devils because he's expecting 25 family members and friends to be in attendance. \"It's going to be exciting to play before so many family and friends,\" he said. \nSo, expect a strong performance by Harold Landry today because you know he doesn't like to disappoint.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:52:29.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
