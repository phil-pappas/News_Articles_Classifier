Lucic, meet conference. If the season opener was any indication, this relationship will be quite rocky.\nLucic, long known for his bull-on-skates style in Boston, debuted for the Kings on Wednesday night and didn’t make it to the final horn. Lucic received a match-penalty ejection with 1:19 remaining in the third period after he charged across the ice and leveled San Jose’s Logan Couture, who had previously hit Lucic.\nA match penalty often is followed by a one-game suspension, but Lucic said late Thursday morning that he hadn’t heard anything from the NHL office. Lucic remained adamant that he didn’t deserve a match penalty.\nIn fact, Lucic went on offense Thursday. Lucic said was upset about a sequence, moments earlier, in which Couture came out of the penalty box and leveled him with a low check. Lucic responded by chasing Couture to the bench and hitting him, but Lucic said his reputation led to a stiffer penalty than he deserved.\n“I think that’s why I got a match,’’ Lucic said. “It’s just because of who I am. If I would have made that hit and someone came after me the same way, he wouldn’t have gotten a match. It just comes with who you are. (League officials) review all that stuff, and there’s nothing that has come of it.’’\nLucic, a 235-pound winger, has exceeded 120 penalty minutes three times in his NHL career, and is well known for his physical play. That includes big hits that sometimes can be viewed as questionably legal. Lucic last received a suspension (one game) for a hit during the 2011-12 season.\nNot surprisingly, opinions after Wednesday’s incident broke along team lines. Lucic said he deserved a minor roughing penalty for the hit, while Coach Darryl Sutter questioned whether Lucic deserved even that.\n“I didn’t cross any line,” Lucic said. “Believe me, if my intentions were to hurt him, I would have hurt him. It’s just like a schoolyard or anything. You’ve got to stand up for yourself when the time is right. If this was 10 years ago and a play like that happened with a minute left, 5-1, it would be a lot messier.”\nLucic took issue with Couture’s (unpenalized) hit and called it “not in my repertoire to pull something like that,” and also scoffed at Couture’s postgame comments, in which Couture said, “I didn’t think there were players that you’re not allowed to hit in this league.”\n“I have no idea why he would say that about me,” Lucic said, “because I get hit just as much as I hit. That’s a dumb comment on his part, but whatever. It just adds fuel to the fire for the upcoming games.”\nKings captain Dustin Brown, who appeared to strike Couture in the head with a high hit in the first period Wednesday, also said he had not heard anything from the league office Thursday.\n“I really can’t comment on that,” Coach Peter DeBoer told San Jose reporters. “I felt there were a couple dangerous plays. They looked at them, chose not to take action on them. We’ve just got to move forward.”\nMOVING FORWARD\nAfter they were stomped 5-1 by the Sharks, the Kings returned to the ice Thursday morning for a back-to-basics practice, one that started with simple breakout drills for the defensemen.\nSutter made no changes to the forward lines or defensive pairs in practice. That meant defenseman Brayden McNabb, a surprise healthy scratch on Wednesday, seemingly remains on the outside.\nMcNabb, whose lineup spot seemed secure in the days leading up to the opener, was benched in favor of the more experienced Jeff Schultz.\n“He had a tough camp,’’ Sutter said of McNabb. “He was outplayed in training camp by the guys who played (Wednesday) night.’’\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:17:50.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
