Three wins over Class 5A ranked teams on the way to the championship match of the state’s premier regular-season tournament. \nBut still ... \n“I’m really happy with how we played all day,” said West Delaware’s Kristen Wegmann. “But I think we settled at the end. We might have started thinking about the outcome too early.” \nThe 4A top-rated Hawks made it all the way to the finals, and had control before 5A No. 7 Ankeny Centennial rallied to escape, 15-25, 25-22, 15-12, to claim the championship of the Westside Invitational volleyball tournament Saturday at Jefferson High School. \nIt was a super day for the Hawks (36-2). It was very nearly super-duper. \n“I guess you’ve just got to keep it in perspective,” Hawks Coach Brett Mather said. “You can’t complain about a runner-up finish at the Westside. \n“(Centennial) started passing better. They have a great offense, and they kept us on our heels a little more in the last two games.” \nWest Delaware scored the last nine points of the first set to gain the upper hand, then led Game 2, 18-14. But the Jaguars (31-3), last year’s 5A state champion, got their game in gear. \nThey tied it at 19, 20 and 21, then scored the last four points of the set. A mid-set run in the finale sent them home winners. \nThe Hawks’ list of victims Saturday was impressive. They swept 5A No. 11 Iowa City West in pool play, then outlasted No. 6 Linn-Mar and No. 5 Cedar Rapids Kennedy in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively. \n“Linn-Mar dominated us in Game 1, but we stayed focused,” Mather said. “We played aggressively. Then we did the same thing against Kennedy. We just kept battling. \n“We needed this competition. This tournament is a mini-state tournament. It’s as good as you’re going to find.” \nLinn-Mar (23-5) defeated Kennedy (21-8) in pool play, and both advanced into the top bracket. West Delaware eliminated both of them, but not before the Cougars swept Dike-New Hartford in the quarterfinals. \n“We ran out of energy at the end (of the West Delaware match),” Kennedy Coach Michelle Goodall said. “We kind of bonked.” \nKennedy is the MVC Valley Division champion and is 6-0 in dual matches, 15-8 in tournament-format competition. \n“I just think we’re better prepared and more focused for the Tuesday-night matches,” Goodall said. “Fortunately, that’s the way it works for (the postseason).” \nThe Cougars are one of several title hopefuls at the MVC tournament next Saturday at Dubuque Senior. \nDubuque Wahlert won the Silver Bracket on Saturday; Jefferson captured the Bronze Bracket. \nWESTSIDE INVITATIONAL VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT \nAt C.R.
