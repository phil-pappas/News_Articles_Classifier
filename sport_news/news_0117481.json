Now they're good friends. \nThirty years ago, Marc Buoniconti collided with Herman Jacobs on a football field and was paralyzed. Now they're good friends. Dave Hyde Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel Columnist Marc Buoniconti and the opponent whose collision paralyzed him have become great friends. \nWhere do you start 30 years later? By framing it as the worst of sports stories? Or the best of sports stories? With the sight of two college kids colliding on a football field and only one walking away? \nOr do you start with the men they became? Because Marc Buoniconti sits in his penthouse condominium, sits overlooking the ocean, sits as he must for the last 30 years and says, \"At that moment, you could never have imagined all the ripples from that one tackle.\" \nOne ripple started The Miami Project To Cure Paralysis. Another raised $450 million for a cure, the most ever for a sports-related charity. There were ripples for saved lives, improved lives, dramatically altered lives. \nAnd one complicated ripple surfaced nearly two decades later when Buoniconti met the man who collided with him that fateful game. He measured how the stranger's pain and anger showed a second life was broken by that tackle in a far different manner than Buoniconti's own paralysis. \n\"What's your dream?\" Buoniconti asked him. \nThere was a pause, because, as Herman Jacobs says now, \"No one had ever asked me that before. You have to understand where I was at that time. My life was up and down. It was a struggle. I couldn't even understand why. I knew I needed help, but I didn't know how to talk about it or bring it all up.\" \nPHOTO GALLERY: Monday marks 30 years since Marc Buoniconti, son of former Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti, was paralyzed while playing football for The Citadel. \nBuoniconti was the second player Jacobs left paralyzed on a football field. In ninth grade, he hit a quarterback who never walked again. Jacobs never played defense after that. He didn't want to hit anyone like that ever again. \nHe became a star running back at East Tennessee State. Buoniconti remembers his coaches at The Citadel saying before their 1985 game how a San Francisco 49ers scout was watching Jacobs. \n\"I wanted to play so they'd notice me instead,\" Buoniconti said. \nJacobs remembers his coaches saying Buoniconti played linebacker like his father, Nick, the Dolphins' Hall of Famer.

Buoniconti became the face of football tragedy. Over time and personal courage, he transformed into a face of hope. \nLast month, thanks to the Miami Project, a paralyzed man was injected with transplanted cells carrying the hope of regenerating movement. \nJacobs' path was different from Buoncionti's. Paralyzing a second player left him ruined in some form, too. The guilt. The anger. He was talked into staying with football, but it was never the same for him. Nor was life, it seems. \n\"I could be in drugs or anything by now,\" he said. \"I knew it was bothering me. I didn't know how badly it was bothering me until I met Marc.\" \nBuoniconti had just made peace with The Citadel the year before in 2006. The school made it an annual event to raise funds for The Miami Project. In 2007, Buoniconti wanted to invite Jacobs, who was found to be managing a fast-food restaurant across the street from Middle Tennessee's football stadium. \n\"What's your dream?\" \nJacobs knew his dream when Buoniconti asked him that day. He wanted to be a chef. The answer makes Buoniconti laugh. \n\"I thought he'd say a coach or a trainer or something in sports,\" Buoniconti said. \nA few meetings after that meeting, Buoniconti invited Jacobs to come down to Miami for a week. Just to get to know each other. In the course of the visit, they went to the culinary school Johnson & Wales. \nThey met school officials. It was explained how to apply for school and scholarships. Buoniconti left it at that. Jacobs had to want it himself. A few months later, he called Buoniconti to say he was enrolled and had a scholarship. There was only one problem. \n\"I have no place to live,\" he said. \n\"Live with me,\" Buoniconti said. \nHe and Jacobs lived together for six months (\"He's a loud snorer,\" Buoniconti said.) For a while, Buoniconti's 24-hour nurse was sick and each morning Jacobs had to pick up the man he once tackled and set him in his wheelchair (\"He's heavy!\" Jacobs said). \nJacobs received his diploma in 2010 with Buoniconti cheering. He became a chef in Miami for a while. He now is a manager for the restaurant chain PDQ headquartered in St. Petersburg. \nMonday marks 30 years since they collided as college kids. Those ripples over the years from the worst of sports stories turned into something beautiful. \n\"He's a special, special friend,\" Buoniconti said of Jacobs. \n\"I'll love that man forever,\" Jacobs said of Buoniconti. \"That's how I feel about him. Love.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:24:03.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
