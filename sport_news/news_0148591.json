(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- Hall, Baca and West Plains win big at Ozark Conference XC The safest bet in the Ozarks sports might well be West Plains cross country. Both teams rolled to victory in the Ozark Conference championships Saturday at David Harrison Elementary in Springfield. In the girls race, Zizzer Hayley Baca paced her way to an overall victory with a time of 19:52.74. While any coach would love to have an overall winner, West Plains girls coach Alisha Gunter got that and more from her team. The Zizzers posted five of the top six times, as Kayli Brower, Sydney Sanders, Madison Brownrigg and Theresa Harto all followed Baca to the line. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE MEET Only Lebanon's Kelsey Winfrey was able to break up the West Plains top-five party, finishing in third at 20:16.30.\"We really wanted to focus on the power of the pack,\" Gunter said. \"We really believe in that, and it's been the Zizzer way for a really long time. The girls have struggled with that in recent years, so we're really working on getting back to what that does for our team when we run together and pull from the strengths of our teammates.\" Strongest of all on the day was Baca. After sitting on Winfrey for much of the race, the senior pulled away down the stretch and led the red surge at the finish line.\"Conference is one of our smaller meets,\" Baca said. \"So we wanted to get our top four seniors out in front. Our goal was to stay together the entire time, because we want to get our numbers tight. When we start separating, we allow people room in there. We always try to keep our fifth as close to us as possible.\" The boys race saw the Zizzers pushed to the brink by a very game Kickapoo squad. The two schools posted the top five times in the event, paced by overall winner Nathan Hall's 15:59.14 for the Chiefs. While Hall finished with a comfortable 30-second cushion over his closest competitor, the rest of the runners from both schools were bunched up in a dog fight. Joshua Ingalls, Jarod Ozee, Brenden Crews, Jacob McCrackin and Ben Stasney rounded out the top-six log jam for the area rivals. A heavy favorite coming into the race, it was obvious Hall wasn't running for himself on the day.\"I'm so excited going into the championship series with my team this year,\" Hall said. \"This is the best team we've had since I've been at Kickapoo, and there were many times when our guys were grouped together in the race working together to get those spots. Coach says we need to race for the other guys on the team, and it's easier to push yourself harder when you're running for someone else.\" Despite strong finishes from the Chiefs at the top of the standings, it was West Plains' depth that pulled off the narrow, four-point victory. Zizzers head coach Joe Bill Dixon was quick to point out his simple and obvious strategy.\"We knew Kickapoo was tough and had a really good team,\" Dixon said. \"We knew they would be very tough up front, so we knew we had to beat them in the back and as far ahead of the back as we could. That's really the only option we had. I have a ton of respect for Coach Goddard and the program he runs. Kickapoo and us ... we're kind of like kinfolk. We really battle it when we battle each other, and then we have a lot of respect for each other.\" Varsity Girls 5K Run - Top 15 1. Hayley Baca, West Plains 19:52.74 2.
