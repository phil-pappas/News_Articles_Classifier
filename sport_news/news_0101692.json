We ran hard, played good defense. I thought we were really solid. ” \nWhile Wilson held Riverheads to 21 points in the first half, Schaefer still managed to pick up 109 yards on 14 carries. \nIt wasn’t until after halftime when the Hornets looked like they might be able to come back, running six plays on their first drive of the half, Jesse Trent picked up a much-needed touchdown off four carries for 20 total yards. \n“They made some plays in the second half and we had to adjust a little bit to what they were doing,” Casto said. \nBut while Diehl and Schaefer have been a big key to the rushing attack, Casto praised the unsung heroes for Riverheads: the offensive line. \nThis season the line has put in work to make blocks and tackles that have been instrumental in getting Diehl, Miller and Schaefer in the end zone. Without it, the rushing attack wouldn’t be nearly as effective as it has been. \nAnd Casto summed up the lines night simply: “There were certainly some good blocks.” \nRIVERHEADS \n7 14 14 7 — 42 \nWILSON MEMORIAL \n0 0 7 0 — 7 \nFirst Quarter \nRH — Harrison Schaefer 10 yard rush (Robson kick good) \nSecond Quarter \nRH — Colt Miller one-yard rush (Robson kick good) \nRH – Colt Miller four-yard rush (Robson kick good) \nThird Quarter \nWM — Jesse Trent two-yard rush (McBee kick good) \nRH — Harrison Schaefer six-yard rush (Robson kick good) \nRH — Landon Deihl eight-yard rush (Robson kick good) \nFourth Quarter 244 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/10/23/riverheads-runs-wilson-memorial/74498396/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:44:37.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
