And Mike Eaves and Jeff Jackson were two guys I spent extended time with as an assistant coach,\" Hynes said. \n\"It's lucky getting into coaching at a younger age. I moved around a little bit and had different experiences with different guys. So it wasn't like you were brought up by one person or one style. You were able to see multiple guys and get different opinions and ideas on his to do things.\" RELATED: 5 talking points after Devils' first 5 games \nThe fact that it came in Madison Square Garden made it even better for Hynes. \n\"It was nice. It was a really good game. Going into the game it was something we knew was going to be difficult,\" Hynes said. \"The players have really worked hard through training camp and the first couple of games. We've had some exhibition games that were good and bad. In regular season we hit some adversity. \n\"But one of the things we've talked to them about and we've tried to do the same thing as coaches is we've tried to be the same people every day and continue to get better and grow. The guys have done that, so it was nice that we were able to get a win. It makes it more special in one of the most historic arenas in the world against the New York Rangers was pretty fun.\" \nHynes pointed to a turning point and that was Kyle Palmieri's fight with Kevin Klein in the final seconds of the first period. \n\"The Rangers played well and gave us everything we could handle early in the game. We had to kind of buck up there and come out in the second period with a little bit stronger effort and some adjustments. We did that and then found a way to win,\" he said.\"You had a situation where Kyle gets into a fight. We hadn't had anything close to that in the first few games where you had that emotional investment in the game. Sometimes you go out and play. Last night we played but there was a difference in playing and competing. As the game wore on, after Kyle's fight, there was a lot more compete than just play.\" \nNow they look to make it two in a row when they face the Arizona Coyotes Tuesday night at Prudential Center. \nCory Schneider will start in goal. \nHynes said defenseman Jon Merrill, who had a stomach virus and missed the Rangers game, might play. Merrill practiced Monday. \n\"Jon is a possibility for tomorrow. We just want to see where he's at physically,\" Hynes said. \nTuomo Ruutu will not be available with an undisclosed injury. \n\"He's day to day with treatment right now,\" Hynes said of Ruutu \nRich Chere may be reached at rchere@njadvancemedia.com .
