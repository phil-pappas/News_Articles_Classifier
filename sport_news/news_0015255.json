There was also a report in the French media that Chelsea offered Martial more money than United did, but the young striker turned the Blues offer down. \nSince coming over from Monaco, the expensive teenager has been a God-send for the Red Devils, providing the spark plug that the offense badly needed. \nWith a dream start to his Old Trafford career, he’s been worth every penny thus far. It was announced today that Martial won the Premier League Player of the Month Award for September. Juan Mata won the Manchester United Player of the Month award . So who’s right, and who’s wrong on this one? Well, you can’t really go wrong either way. Both Mata and Martial played in four games, with Martial scoring three times and Mata twice. Mata had two assists to Martial’s one. He also created seven chances while Martial created three. Juan Mata had a goal and an assist in two UEFA Champions League games. ( Here’s a link to more on Mata and his award ) \nAnthony Martial, off to a made-for-TV-movie like start with United, is dreaming of even bigger things. He made his first ever start for France on Monday (here’s the video highlights), and later told French TV show Telefoot: \n“I think we can win the Premier League and the Champions League this season. Both of them. We are among the top five clubs (in Europe).” \nYes, Martial believes he can help lead United to a double this season! He also assessed the state of his United career thus far. \n“It is going well so far. I have had a great welcome from the fans. I don’t think about my price on the pitch.” \n“The goal against Liverpool, the big enemy of the club, allowed the fans to get to know me a bit better.” \nAnthony Martial and his United teammates return to league action on Saturday versus Everton. Bet365 has Everton odds of winning at 9-4, a draw at 12-5 and a United victory at 11-8. ESPN’s Soccer Power Index gives Everton a 37% chance of winning, while United has a 34% chance. The SPI places the chances for a draw at 30%. \nPaul M. Banks owns, operates and sometimes writes The Sports Bank.net , which is partnered with FOX Sports Engage Network.
