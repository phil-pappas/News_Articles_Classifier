Stark County (8-0) The Rebels can't overlook Princeville, a loss could tarnish the hopes of an outright conference title, but things certainly are headed in the right direction entering the postseason. Is this the Stark County group to finally win it all? Possibly. 2. Annawan/Wethersfield (7-1) A road matchup with Mid-County will test the Titans and is good preparation for the playoffs. It will be interesting to see where A/W falls in terms of class-size Saturday night. As of now they are 2A but things could change. 3. Elmwood/Brimfield (7-1) Elmwood/Brimfield can score. Another 50-plus point effort against Abindgon-Avon puts the Titans in position to get a home game to start the playoff despite a fairly weak playoff point total. 4. Orion (7-1) Winless Riverdale is what the Chargers have on tap for Week 9 which is good in the sense that a Three Rivers Rock title is probable but bad in the sense that they will head to the playoffs coming off a less than helpful prep game. 5. United (6-2) Losing to Stark County is not the end of the world but looking non-competitive at home does not bode well for the Red Storm in the postseason. A loss to Mercer County and United is looking at a road game to start the playoffs.
