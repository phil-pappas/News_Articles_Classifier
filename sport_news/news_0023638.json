This year, the Flying Queens are expected to be led by a pair of NAIA All-Americans in seniors Stephanie Afunugo, the reigning SAC Co-Defensive Player of the Year who was WBU's top scorer a year ago averaging 13.7 points per game, and Laura Castillo, an All-SAC First-Teamer who averaged 13.2 ppg. Another starter back is junior guard Shawna Monreal. \nOther veterans returning are Shayla Monreal, back after sitting out last season with an injury, Nina Sato, Regan Hestand, Gabby Gonzales and Jada Riley. Newcomers are Jade Jones, Brianna Bogard, Krystal Forthan and Maci Merket. \nThe remainder of the teams in the poll were Texas Wesleyan in third with 78 points, Mid-America Christian in fourth with 72, John Brown in fifth with 69 and Science and Arts in sixth at 51. The final teams were Southwestern Christian in seventh with 50 points, Southwestern Assemblies of God in eighth with 40 points and St. Gregory's in ninth with 26 points. Conference newcomer Bacone was voted 10th with 24 points. \nThe Flying Queens unofficially open their season by hosting Midland College in a scrimmage at 2 p.m. Saturday in Hutcherson Center before going to West Texas A&M for another scrimmage on Nov. 5. Wayland's official season-opener is Nov. 10 at home against University of the Southwest (Hobbs, N.M.) \nSAC teams will use a double round-robin scheduling model, in which each team plays a home and away match against each of the other teams. The final regular-season standings will determine the seedings for the conference post-season tournament scheduled for March 2-5, 2015 in Waxahachie on the campus of Southwestern Assemblies of God University. \n2015-16 SAC Women's Basketball Pre-Season Poll \n1.
