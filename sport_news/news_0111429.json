The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is changing the emphasis of his 2016 campaign for governor to gun control, which will keep him “so busy he will have little time to get deeply involved with the other initiative he has been close to in recent years – legalizing recreational marijuana.”\nSo, instead of aiming to reduce government intrusion into our lives, he will push for increasing it.\nThe gun initiative is being sponsored by the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. What they’re calling the Safety for All initiative would, among other things, ban ammunition magazines holding more than 10 bullets and require “licensing of ammunition vendors and point-of-sale background checks for ammunition purchases.”\nReferring to recent mass shootings in schools and of children in some troubled neighborhoods, Mr. Newsom told the Chronicle that gun control “is a very deep issue for many of us, particularly those of us with children.”\nHowever, as Northeastern University criminologist James Allen Fox wrote in USA Today, although gun deaths are up somewhat this year, they are down from five years ago. “Most of the time, these spikes are merely statistical anomalies that dissipate as soon as the news focus shifts to other matters,” he said.\nAs to limiting magazine capacity and bullet purchases, people intent on mass mayhem simply could drive to Arizona or Nevada to get bullets and magazines. Bullets also can be made at home. Moreover, the mass murderers in Columbine, Colo., in 1999 used 10-round magazines, which quickly can be swapped in and out of a weapon.\nThe 2012 theater shootings in Aurora, Colo., ended when killer James Eagan Holmes’ high-capacity magazine jammed, something more likely with the larger springs in such magazines.\nMeanwhile, the evidence continues to pile up that enacting “gun-free zones,” as the California Legislature did this year for colleges and universities, is the wrong solution. According to the Crime Prevention Research Center, since at least 1950, all but two mass shootings occurred in “gun-free zones.” And recent mass gun killings have been 1.96 times higher in Germany and 2.46 times higher in the United Kingdom, both countries with strict gun control, than in the United States.\nIt’s clear that mentally ill people are more likely to commit mayhem where honest citizens are disarmed. Mr. Newsom’s feel-good initiative might help his electoral chances, but will do nothing to keep Californians safer.\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
