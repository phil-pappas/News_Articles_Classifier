He also played on the 24-win Cleveland Cavaliers team in 2012-13 with Livingston and Speights. \nSpeights noted that three seasons ago, he was joking with Walton about him getting old. Now, Walton is filling in for Kerr in a head coaching position that Speights believes his former teammate can one day do full-time. \n\"It's really fun,\" Speights said. \"You've got your friend coaching you. \n\"He ain't really going to yell at nobody. He's going to talk to us like men like we all are. He makes sure he communicates with us real good, and we listen to him. We respect him.\" \nWalton said Kerr attended most of practice Sunday and addressed the team with an emphasis on having an attention to detail. \nKerr later addressed the media for the first time since taking a leave of absence, confirming that symptoms of a spinal fluid leak were the result of a complication from an offseason back surgery. Advertisement \nWalton said he hoped that Kerr appearing to look better was a sign the 50-year-old would soon return to the team, but added that there was no timetable. \nIn the meantime, Walton is learning about head coaching on the fly. \n\"There's a lot more than goes into this than you could know until you actually have to do this stuff,\" Walton said. \"But that's why I'm grateful we have intelligent players. \n\"If I had to do this all on myself with a bunch of guys that didn't want to work, I probably would have quit a couple days ago.\" \nThe Warriors drew one step closer to building their new arena, announcing they have formally acquired the 12-acre site in San Francisco from Salesforce.com . \nThe price of the private land was about $150 million, Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times last month. The Warriors last April had purchased an option on the property in the Mission Bay neighborhood bounded by 3rd, 16th and South Streets and Terry Francois Blvd. \nThe closing came days after the Warriors along with UCSF and San Francisco mayor Ed Lee announced that UCSF would officially endorse the arena project after reaching preliminary agreements to address traffic concerns for the neighboring hospital. \n\"We've been the Bay Area's team for more than 50 years, and this plan keeps us in the Bay Area for the next 50 and beyond,\" Warriors president Rick Welts said in a statement. \"If there were any lingering doubts about our commitment to Mission Bay, purchasing this land should put them to rest. We love this neighborhood -- nobody else is getting this land.\" \nSome UCSF scientists who oppose the arena had written in a letter to Lee last month, \"Our major fear is that the Mission Bay site will lose its appeal -- not only for the new biomedical enterprises that the city would like to attract here, but also for most of its current occupants.\" \nLee has long supported the project. Asked what was more important between biomedical collaboration or an NBA arena in San Francisco, Welts said, \"It's what the city of San Francisco wants is the most important thing.\" \nThe Warriors plan to open the privately financed arena in time for the 2018-19 season even as Welts said there are unknowns as to when construction would begin due to the possibility of litigation. The entire project is expected to cost the Warriors more than $1 billion, as offices, public plazas, restaurants will also be built on the site. \nForward Tony Mitchell was waived after not playing in either of the team's preseason games.
