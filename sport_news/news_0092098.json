In his absence, Baylor passing game coordinator and running back coach Jeff Lebby will call offensive plays on Saturday during Baylor's game against Lamar, according to a report from the Waco Tribune-Herald.\nLebby has been with Briles since his arrival at Baylor in 2008. He first was in charge of quality control and was the NFL liason. In 2012, Lebby was promoted to a full assistant coach in charge of the running backs. The Bears have featured at least one 1,000-yard rusher in every season since the change.\nLebby was named one of the top 10 recruiters in the Big 12 by Rivals in 2014. In early 2015, he was promoted to passing game coordinator and offensive recruiting coordinator. However, this will be his first game as a playcaller for Baylor football.\nAfter serving their one-game suspension, Kendal Briles and Wallis are both expected to be back in time for Baylor's Sept. 26 game against Rice.\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BriceCherry/status/642492049078415360", "https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-09-12T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:49:00.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
