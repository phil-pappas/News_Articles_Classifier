Leading scorer Haley Larsen (eight goals) and Frankie Raffaele scored in the victory for the Warriors, who are 6-1 in division play. Midland Park (5-1-1 in division) and Park Ridge (8-0-1) will meet today, and Waldwick will see the Owls again Friday — two games that will go a long way in determining this year’s Patriot champion. RICHARD FORMICOLA/SPECIAL TO THE RECORD Frankie Raffaele scored in Waldwick’s win Saturday. \n-- Officially, there were three remaining undefeated teams left in North Jersey entering Tuesday: No. 1 Northern Highlands (11-0), No. 11 Clifton (11-0) and No. 13 Park Ridge (11-0-2). Park Ridge, by the book, remained undefeated despite falling in a shootout to Paramus Catholic in Sunday’s Bergen County tournament second round after the teams played to a scoreless tie. \n-- Mahwah, Ramsey and River Dell continue battling for the Big North Patriot title, with the Thunderbirds currently the only unbeaten team in league play at 2-0-1 (win over Ramsey, tie against RD), but the Rams (3-1) and Golden Hawks (2-1-1) are within striking distance. Including the game Rachel Sorkenn suffered a broken fibula, River Dell has gone 7-1 in her absence, with sophomore Julie McGovern emerging. She has a team-best six goals. \n-- Lyndhurst sophomore Mia Luna has been one of the most dangerous scoring threats and freshman goalie Izzy Castagnetti has been one of the best keepers in North Jersey. After posting six one-goal games through Oct. 1, Luna has scored 10 goals in the Golden Bears’ past five games (4-0-1), including a two-goal performance in Lyndhurst’s BCT upset win over Indian Hills. She has 16 goals this season. Castagnetti posted shutouts against Indian Hills (13 saves) and Paramus (six). \n-- Dwight-Englewood (7-3) has won five in a row and its only losses have come against ranked opponents: No. 1 Northern Highlands, 7-0, No. 15 Lyndhurst, 4-2, and No. 23 New Milford, 1-0. Career 100-goal scorer Taylor Krakower continues leading the charge with a team-best 19 goals. She has 118 in her career. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:38:52.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
