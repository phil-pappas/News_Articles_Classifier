Everyone is doing such an incredible job once again this season and every bit of this success is well deserved. \n\"The car was unbelievable to drive in Japan, so hopefully it'll be more of the same at the remaining races - starting in Sochi. \n\"Last year was the first experience I'd had of Russia in my racing career and we had a great race there. The circuit is really well put together - quite long, with some interesting corners and opportunities to overtake. \n\"Hopefully now fans have seen what a great facility they have there and how beautiful Sochi is, we'll see plenty more people in the stands this year too.\" \nHamilton, who won in Sochi last year as Mercedes clinched the constructors' championship, added: \"It was great to win the first race for Formula One in Russia and a fantastic moment for the team to take the title there last time out. \n\"Fingers crossed we can add to those great memories again this weekend - I'll be pushing as hard as I can to make that happen.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:02.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
