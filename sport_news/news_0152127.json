(AP) - East Mississippi Community College football coach Buddy Stephens has been given a two-game suspension after an on-field altercation with a game administrator during the Lions' 48-24 win over Itawamba Community College.\nThe Clarion-Ledger reports ( http://on.thec-l.com/1O6MHam ) the sideline scuffle occurred in the fourth quarter of last Saturday's game. Video shows the game administrator can be seen throwing his clipboard and appears to swing at Stephens. Stephens then appears to swing at the administrator as he moves toward the official before being restrained.\nEMCC President Thomas M. Huebner, Jr., in a statement Wednesday, said while he believes Stephens didn't initiate contact, he responded in a manner \"not consistent with our institutional expectations\" and issued the suspension.\nMississippi Association of Community & Junior Colleges officials did not return a telephone call for comment.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
