(AP) - Todd Gurley rushed for all but two of his 146 yards in the second half and the St. Louis Rams held on to hand the Arizona Cardinals their first loss of the season, 24-22 on Sunday.\nGurley, the Rams' first-round draft pick, saw his most extensive action as a pro and his 52-yard run set up what proved to be the winning touchdown.\nNick Foles threw for three touchdowns, two after Arizona turnovers, and St. Louis' defense held the Cardinals (3-1) to field goals on four of five trips inside the red zone.\nArizona had a third-and-2 at the Rams 43 in the final minutes, but Carson Palmer overthrew receivers on consecutive plays to turn the ball over on downs.\nThe Rams (2-2) are 2-0 against the NFC West.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Gurley had 2 yards in 1st half instead of 5.\n\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
