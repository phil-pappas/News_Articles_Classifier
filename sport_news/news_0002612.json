He was duly picked by the local media as the best Super Eagles player in the game. \nJAMIU ALIMI 5/10 Proved to be a good partner for Oboroakpo. He put up a good performance in the first half, but an ankle injury forced him off at half-time. \nCHIMA AKAS 7/10 Gave a good account of himself and proved a worthy captain on the day as he consistently thwarted all efforts by the Stallions attackers to pass through him. \nPAUL ONOBI 6/10 Started slowly but grew in confidence as the game progressed. He provided support for the centre-backs even though he offered little going forward. \nIFEANYI MATHEW 5/10 Mathew never really imposed himself in the middle of the park like he hid in the first leg. He was subdued by the trickery of Burkina Faso No.10, Mohammed Sylla, who was fantastic for the Stallions. \nBATURE YARO 6/10 The midfielder was nowhere near his best but still managed to put up an above average showing in the game. \nEZEKIEL BASSEY 7/10 The Enyimba winger who was criticised for his below par showing in the first leg put up a fine performance as he was a constant threat to the opposition. \nOSAS OKORO 4/10 Struggled to get going in the game and was duly substituted in the second half. \nTUNDE ADENIJI 5/10 The Sunshine Stars forward was closely marked by the opposing defenders. He also failed to convert the few chances that came his way. \nSUBSTITUTES STEPHEN EZE 6/10 The towering Sunshine Stars centre-back proved a suitable replacement for the injured Jamiu Alimi. Combined well with Oboroakpo to keep the Burkinabes at bay. \nGBOLAHAN SALAMI 4/10 Made a couple of good runs into the opposition half, but his introduction did little to ease pressure on the Eagles. \nCHISOM CHIKATARA 3/10 Came in for Adeniji in the closing stages of the game. Didn't have enough minutes to impress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:06:53.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
