Ketcham High School boys soccer team dominating in a 3-0 upset of John Jay, but the Indians' attire. \nKetcham, doing away with its usual blue and red, sported orange and black home jerseys on Saturday. And it had nothing to do with Halloween. \nThe game was played in honor of Kelly McConologue, a Ketcham junior who is battling leukemia. She stood on the sideline, and even with a surgical mask on, cheered loudly for her schoolmates. Her bright eyes and wide smile belie the ordeal she has endured. \n\"Stuff like this makes me feel a lot better,\" McConologue said. The 16-year-old was diagnosed with Acute Myelocytic Leukemia in April. \"Being here reminds me that I have a lot of supportâ€¦ Positivity is what gets me through this.\" \nShe was presented a custom Indians jersey during a pregame ceremony and the team's adopted slogan, \"Play for Kelly,\" was yelled intermittently from the crowd. \nAnd the Indians did, indeed, play well for Kelly.
