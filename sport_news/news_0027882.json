It was too soon, he said, to talk about his fate. \nIn his postgame press conference, Mattingly was asked what the loss meant for his status for next season. Would he be asked back for another year? \n“Seriously, you're asking me that now?” Mattingly said \nHe asked the press conference moderator to move on to another question. \nIn the clubhouse, though, his players spoke highly of the job Mattingly has done. \n“I’m glad I play for Don,” third baseman Justin Turner said. “I would play for Donnie any day of the week. Anything he wanted me to do, anything he asked of me, I’m right there, I’m behind him 100%. I think he’s an unbelievable manager, did an unbelievable job handling everything that goes on both on and off the field with this club, and he’s got my support 100%.” \nReliever J.P. Howell said he has appreciated Mattingly’s steadiness throughout his time with the Dodgers. \n“All three years I’ve been here so far, it’s a different type of job here,” Howell said. “The expectations are World Series or fail, and that’s throughout the whole season, so he’s done a great job of when it’s not going so well, he’s always cool to be around. He’s never been terrible, even when he’s looking like he might be in trouble in 2013, he was great. He was great to be around. We were in Milwaukee at the time, and he handled that cool as a cucumber, so that’s all we could ask.” \nThe Dodgers have reached the postseason three times in Mattingly's five years, and they have won the National League West three years in a row. But in that time, they have won one series and lost three and have yet to appear in a World Series. \nOutfielder Enrique Hernandez said this year’s loss was not Mattingly’s fault. \n“We didn't lose because of Donnie, like everybody says,” Hernandez said. “We lost because we couldn't score runs. Donnie has nothing to do with this. There's no reason Donnie has to be fired.” \nDodgers co-owner Mark Walter said president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman will make the final decision on Mattingly’s fate. \n“You can’t hire guys like that and then make the decisions for them,” Walter said. \nStaff writers Bill Shaikin and Dylan Hernandez contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:27:26.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
