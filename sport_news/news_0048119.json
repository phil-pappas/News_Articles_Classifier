The inexperience showed Saturday night.\nThe Griffs struggled as a team defensively, dropping their season opener, 6-1, to Penn State at HarborCenter. Nine players made their collegiate debut for the Griffs, including half of the team’s defensive corps. That led to scrambling play in their own end as players looked lost in coverage at times. There were spurts of scoring chances – mostly from Shane Conacher, Ralph Cuddemi and Josh Kielich – but little sustained offensive pressure.\nQuick start for Penn State: The Nittany Lions jumped out to a 2-0 lead just two minutes into the game. Curtis Loik scored after Canisius goaltender Reilly Turner made a bad pass when playing the puck from behind his own net and then was beat on the point-blank shot. Ricky DeRosa scored just 27 seconds later. The lead expanded to 3-0 in the first when Chase Berger scored on a rush as the Canisius defense looked confused on coverage.\nSpecial teams: Canisius found itself down two men in the second period. David Bennett took a penalty for elbowing/contact to the head. Then Ryan Schmelzer was called for a five-minute major for hitting from behind. Penn State scored a 5-on-3 goal as David Glen’s shot hit Turner in the shoulder and bounced into the upper corner of the net. David Goodwin added another goal during the five-minute major as the Nittany Lions extended their lead to 5-0.\nOn the board: The Griffs broke through for a power-play goal at 9:40 of the third. Conacher fed Cuddemi from the right face-off circle and the senior sniped the puck past Eamon McAdam. It was the 42nd career goal for Cuddemi and the 17th on the power play.\nFirst point: Freshman and Lancaster native Dylan McLaughlin picked up the second assist on Cuddemi’s goal for his first collegiate point. He centered Cuddemi and Conacher after Schmelzer left with the game misconduct.\nRookie debuts: Nine players for Canisius made their collegiate debuts – forwards Joshua Gabbriel (Lancaster), Felix Chamberland, McLaughlin (Lancaster), Josh Supryka, Daniel LaFontaine, Matt McLeod and defensemen Cameron Heath, Ian Edmondson and Jimmy Mazza.\nLocal connection: Penn State freshman forward Andrew Sturtz made his collegiate debut in his hometown. Sturtz, who played his junior hockey with the Carleton Place Canadians in the Central Canada Hockey League, graduated from Kenmore East in 2012.\nThe battle of Pegula buildings: Terry Pegula has spread his wealth when it comes to growing the game of hockey. A Penn State alum, he helped finance the Nittany Lions move to Division I, including the Pegula Ice Arena. Meanwhile in Buffalo, he built HarborCenter, home to Canisius hockey. Happy Valley has sold out the 5,782-seat arena in 33 of their 36 home games in their first two seasons. The feature rink at HarborCenter seats 1,800 and the Griffs sold out the building twice in their inaugural season – on opening weekend when they hosted Ohio State for two games. Canisius averaged 1,087 fans over 20 home dates last year.\nCounting the house: 1,711.\nNext up: Canisius hosts No. 16 Bowling Green at 7:35 p.m. Friday in HarborCenter.\nemail: amoritz@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:57:09.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
