The Hoosiers have been very closedmouthed about whether their quarterback is ready after sitting out the last game and a half with an ankle injury. If he can’t play, third-stringer Danny Cameron takes over. Sudfeld led Indiana to its first 4-0 start since 1990 by leading the Big Ten in yards passing per game (255) and fewest interceptions (one).\nRutgers offense vs. Indiana defense: Leonte Carroo returned from his suspension to catch seven passes for 134 yards and three touchdowns in the loss to Michigan State. That doesn’t bode well for Indiana’s secondary, which is the Hoosiers’ vulnerability. RU head coach Kyle Flood, back on the sidelines after his suspension, has a lot of offensive options against the Hoosiers, including his musical chair running backs. Defensive end Nick Mangieri and linebacker Zack Shaw are Indiana’s defensive leaders. They’ve combined for 10 sacks and 54 tackles (12 for losses).\nIndiana offense vs. Rutgers defense: Sudfeld isn’t the only Indiana player who’s questionable. Top runner Jordan Howard, who leads the Big Ten with 141.8 yards per game, sat out last week’s loss to Penn State with an ankle injury. No matter who plays quarterback, the Hoosiers have a pair of talented receivers in Ricky James (26 catches, 516 yards, three touchdowns) and Simmie Cobbs Jr. (22 catches, 317 yards, two TDs). After Penn State ran through the Scarlet Knights, Rutgers tightened its run defense against Michigan State. But RU is still suspect against the pass.\nDid you know? This is Rutgers’ third game in Indiana. They traveled to South Bend to play Notre Dame in the first two.\nPrediction: Rutgers 31, Indiana 27\n— John Rowe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:32:19.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
