Pic/AFP \nUnited and City had the chance to make a real statement about their title chances by registering a big win, but neither was up to the challenge and the two teams played out just the third goalless draw between them in Premier League history.\nWilfried Bony was unable to fill the considerable void left by Sergio Aguero's absence while Yaya Toure had a day to forget playing in the number 10 role where the injured David Silva usually causes so much damage.\nUnited fared no better. It was only in the last 10 minutes that they started to turn the screw on their rivals.\nWayne Rooney failed to mark his first match as a thirty something with a goal. The United captain, who needed his head stapling together after a clash of heads with Vincent Kompany, was anonymous throughout.\nJesse Lingard rattled the bar and Joe Hart saved from Chris Smalling at the death, but otherwise the hosts did not trouble the City goalkeeper. A wall of noise hit the players as they emerged from the tunnel and both sets of fans traded insults from opposite ends of the packed stadium.\nThe atmosphere soon dampened down, however, as a dull first half ensued.\nRooney did his best to ignite proceedings, hurtling at the away defence. Toure was lucky to escape a booking after taking down the United skipper near the halfway line.\nJuan Mata appealed for a penalty after the ball brushed Fernandinho's arm, but Mark Clattenburg waved play on.\nThe Brazilian entered the book for a clumsy challenge on Anthony Martial, who was United's only threat in the opening half. The Frenchman won a free-kick after bamboozling Bacary Sagna, but United wasted it.\nWhile Antonio Valencia was down having treatment for a knock, Rooney sprinted to the touchline with blood gushing from the top of his head following a clash with Kompany. United's medical staff stapled the wound together so he could carry on.\nKane stars in Spurs win \nMeanwhile, Harry Kane returned to form as he struck a hat-trick to sink sorry Bournemouth. The England international had scored just once for Spurs this season heading into the clash at the Vitality Stadium but showed his finishing touch had not deserted him as he scored three in the 5-1 mauling of Eddie Howe's side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:51:54.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
