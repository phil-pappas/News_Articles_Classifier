(WGEM) -- Nathan Knuffman found himself in a situation kickers dream of.The Camp Point Central grad had a game winning field goal attempt in the final seconds of last week's game with Southern Illinois.And he left little doubt connecting on the 20-yard boot to send Western Illinois to a 37-36 win last Saturday.\"I knew when the offense got the ball back that they were going to get me in position to make the game winner. We pulled though and it was just a great moment,\" Knuffman said.\"I was really just ready for it honestly and I've been waiting for this my whole career. It finally came to me and we took advantage of it.\"According to teammate Adam Hoogerwerf: \"I think everyone on the sidelines knew he was going to make it. We had all the confidence in the world in him.\"As quickly as the Leathernecks celebrated their one-point win the page was turned.The opportunity now presents itself to be 2-0 in the Missouri Valley Football Conference when South Dakota pays a visit on Saturday.\"One win doesn't make a season,\" Hoogerwerf proclaimed.\"We're 2-2 right now and I think the most important thing to keep it going is you got to keep winning. Once you start stringing a couple of wins together then it starts feeling natural.\"While Western is coming off a successful start to conference play South Dakota enters the contest losers of 13 straight in the Valley.The Coyotes have just one conference road win since joining in 2012.With that said Leathernecks head coach Bob Nielson says South Dakota is blessed with plenty of experience.\"Guys that understand what playing in the Missouri Valley is all about and fundamentally they're very sound,\" Nielson said. \"They are a team that you have to beat that aren't going to beat themselves.\"The Leathernecks enter the affair with three straight wins over the Coyotes but they don't plan on simply assuming the past will repeat itself.\"This conference is so competitive,\" Hoogerwerf said.\"Every time you go out there you know it's going to be a battle. There's no roll over games.\"Nielson added: \"I don't think we've put a complete football game together yet. The goal that we have this week is to be better in all elements and continue to advance as a team.\"Game time at Hanson Field is set for 3 p.m..As added importance for the Leathernecks to win they hit the road four out of the next five weeks. In fact, all six games after Saturday will be against teams that are currently nationally ranked.
