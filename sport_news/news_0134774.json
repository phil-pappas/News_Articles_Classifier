Shaun Stanley/Durango Herald file photo Eric Walker will hope to have his best performance of the season this week at state to help the Demons compete for a championship. M onday and Tuesday’s state golf tournament will mark the end of an era not only for Demons’ boys golf team but it’ll be the last go-round for a foursome of longtime friends. Durango High School seniors Cameron Barnhardt, Cory Gillespie, Cy Spicer and Eric Walker have been competing with and against each other for as long as they’ve been playing competitive golf. They helped deliver the regional championship three times in the row to Durango High School and have every intention of closing out their time as teammates with the ultimate prize – a title at the Colorado High School Activities Association Class 4A Boys Golf State Championships. “I’ve known these guys forever and we all have that competitive edge,” said Gillespie, son of Jackie and Tracey Gillespie. “I remember playing in the junior club championship when we were 10 and 11 years old and we were shooting under par. We just know each other so well. We work our tails off, and we’re more comfortable with ourselves and our game, so I expect us to win. That’s what we want to do. That’s how it should end.” Gillespie led the Demons in last year’s state championship with an 8-over-par two-day total of 152, which was good enough for an 11th-place finish. He will make his fourth trip to state for the Demons, a major feat for any high school golfer. The rest of the team didn’t fare too well last year, and they want redemption. “Last year I just went all out and tried to swing as hard as I could because I knew I had one more year with these guys and I felt like I had nothing to lose, but this time I’ll be a bit more careful,” said Eric Walker, son of Michael and Trina Walker. “I used to ride bikes with these guys when we were kids. I don’t think there are any teams that are as close as we are, and that’s what has made us so successful here.” Walker might need to keep his driver in the bag more often than not at this year’s state tournament. While last year’s championship host course, Walking Stick in Pueblo, played to over 7,100 yards, this year’s host, Fox Hill Country Club in Longmont, plays at 6,600 yards from the back tees. It will put a premium on target golf and short game prowess, which should play into the hands of a disciplined and experienced team such as Durango. “There are a lot of doglegs, and I heard that it’s pretty tight,” said Barnhardt, son of Beth and Bob Barnhardt. “I’m confident in my short game, so I think it will work to my advantage.” It is Barnhardt’s third year at the state tournament. He tied for 50th last year but posted a 2-over 74 to lead the Demons in this year’s regional tournament at Haymaker Golf Club in Steamboat Springs. Spicer had an uncharacteristically poor outing last year at the state meet but is playing some of the best golf he’s ever played entering this year’s event. “Last year I kind of psyched myself out and put a bit too much pressure on myself,” the son of Scott Spicer said. “I’m more excited and anxious to get out there this time around. I feel better about my game, and I know that if I stick to my game plan, execute every shot and stay patient things will go well for me.” Spicer’s maturity from last year to now was evident at the regional tournament, where he recovered from an early mishap and played flawlessly. He took a triple-bogey on the par-3 fifth hole at Haymaker and played his last 13 holes 2-under to finish with 74. “These guys are gritty,” said Demons’ head coach Kirk Rawles. “When they need to play their best they do, and that’s not easy to do in golf. I think there might have been some jitters last year, but we’re paired with Steamboat and Valor Christian this year, and they’re two of the best teams in the state. If we can beat the guys we’re paired with, we’ve got a really good chance of winning.” If you ask this group, they have more than just a chance. “We better win,” Spicer said. “It’s our last time together, and I expect us to win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:56:10.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
