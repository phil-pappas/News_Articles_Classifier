As Fitzgerald raced upfield, inside linebacker NaVorro Bowman chased him while raising his hands, palms up, in the air, the universal what’s-going-on-here sign.\nOn the Fox telecast, Thom Brennaman and Charles Davis wondered how an eight-time Pro Bowl pass-catcher could be uncovered.\n“You saw NaVorro Bowman, one of the few veterans remaining on this 49ers defense, throw his hands in the air asking probably the same question,” Brennaman said.\nThe play highlighted both the 49ers’ early-season pass-coverage issues and Bowman’s visible frustration as they have surrendered 676 passing yards en route to losing the past two games by a score of 90-25.\nIn fact, three plays after Fitzgerald’s all-alone reception, Bowman again threw his hands to the heavens after Fitzgerald hauled in a 17-yard catch between inside linebacker Michael Wilhoite and cornerback Kenneth Acker . Fitzgerald had, again, lined up in the slot against an outside linebacker ( Ahmad Brooks ) and had roamed free after an initial bump.\nIn the second quarter, Bowman raised his hands when tackle Tony Jerod-Eddie jumped offside and, along with the rest of the defense, he subsequently stopped for a few seconds as running back Chris Johnson embarked on an easy 15-yard scamper. Four plays later, Bowman’s hands went skyward in apparent pre-snap confusion before Palmer fired a 27-yard strike to John Brown on 3rd-and-10.\nOne viewpoint: So what? The ultra-competitive linebacker’s frustration is understandable in the midst of a 40-point loss. However, it wasn’t the greatest look from a team leader. For example, when Bowman chased Fitzgerald with his hands raised, it smacked of a player making it clear the screwup wasn’t his fault.\nAfter a 43-18 loss at Pittsburgh in Week 2 in which the 49ers surrendered six completions of at least 28 yards, Bowman was asked how he played: “I made the plays that I could. They threw the ball over my head several times and I can’t do anything about that. I got the right calls made and I did my job.”\nOn Thursday, defensive coordinator Eric Mangini was asked about Bowman’s frustration. Mangini offered a 264-word response in which he suggested he’d talked with Bowman about how to handle the 49ers’ two-game nosedive. Bowman, who has yet to speak with the media this week, is one of nine team captains and one of four defensive starters with more than 34 career starts.\n“I’ve talked to guys, not just Bo, but throughout my career I’ve had those conversations: What do you do about” frustration? Mangini said. “If you don’t like what’s happening — start with yourself. What things can you fix and then how do you become as positive an influence as you possibly can on the group?\n“From leadership, what you’re always looking for is — it’s easy to lead in those moments when everybody’s high-fiving you and giving you lots of love. Leaders are really revealed in those toughest moments. In those darkest moments.”\nOf course, Bowman was hardly the only player irritated in a game the 49ers trailed 28-0 after 23 minutes. Wide receiver Anquan Boldin , another team captain, had animated conversations with quarterback Colin Kaepernick and head coach Jim Tomsula in the first half. On Thursday, Boldin said he was angry about the situation, not his quarterback.\n“My frustration was with us as a team,” Boldin said. “We didn’t play the way we were capable of playing. We didn’t execute well. We just didn’t look like ourselves.\n“And, for me, that’s where the frustration comes in. You work your butt off in practice all week and to go out and to lay an egg, basically? I don’t think anyone is satisfied with that performance.”\nTomsula indicated the 49ers had a clear-the-air meeting Tuesday, which helped alter a negative vibe. Before the meeting, safety Eric Reid acknowledged “some guys were upset,” but they subsequently channeled it into preparing for Sunday’s game against Green Bay (3-0).\n“This is an emotional sport,” Reid said. “I think some guys are unhappy with the way that they’ve played, or the outcome of our games. We’ve just got to bounce back and play better.”\nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
