TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - \nPusch Ridge Christian Academy arrived Friday night at Flowing Wells' Mead Athletic Arena. \nSenior Cody Cropp led the Lions on an epic and methodical 15-play game-winning 79-yard drive that he punctuated with a one-yard touchdown run, allowing 8th ranked PRCA to beat the #7 Caballeros 24-21, spoiling Flowing Wellsâ€™ homecoming night. \nThe Lions (6-1) down 11 on two occasions in the second half found big plays to keep themselves in the game. \nTrailing 14-3, Cropp hit senior receiver Ben Walker on a swing pass that his fellow senior bobbled before he turned it into a spectacular 71-yard touchdown reception in which he tight-roped the sideline. \nAfter the Cabs (7-1) scored on a five-yard Tyler Stiltner run to take a 21-10 lead, the Lions Tamerat McLeod busted a 58-yard scoring scamper to again cut PRCA deficit to four. \nThe Lions defense handed the ball back to their offense with 7:59 to play in the game and Cropp proceeded to engineer what might have been the biggest drive in program history. \nThe coach's son scored with 1:33 to play to give Pusch Ridge their first lead of the night. \nThe defense held off one final charge by Flowing Wells. \nWalker finished with three catches for 116 yards. McLeod ran for 135 yards on 14 carries while senior fullback James Raica added 96 on 16 rushing attempts. \nFlowing Wells tailback Dionte Flores entered the evening with 1,516 yards and 23 touchdowns but the Lions held him to 47 yards on 11 carries, just the second time in the last two seasons the senior did not eclipse the 100-yard rushing mark. \nJulio Sandoval returned to quarterback the Cabs after missing five-plus games due to a broken thumb. The senior threw a pair of touchdown passes to Stiltner and Bailey Caron.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:57:52.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
