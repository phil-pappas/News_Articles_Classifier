(AP) â€” A jury has awarded a Little Compton fisherman and his wife $2.6 million after he lost his arm in a winch accident.\nThe Providence Journal reports that a jury in Newport made the award this month to Mark Lambert and his wife after a two-week trial.\n Lambert says he was unloading a catch at a commercial fishing dock in Little Compton owned and operated by N. Parascandolo & Sons and H.N. Wilcox Fishing in April 2013.\nHe was using a hoisting crane when his right arm was pulled into the machine. His lawyers argued the companies negligently maintained the winch.\nLawyers for the companies could not immediately be reached and listed phone numbers for the companies were not in operation.\nThe 63-year-old Lambert stopped fishing commercially after 45 years.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1jWxduh"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:03:21.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
