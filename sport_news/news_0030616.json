That should ensure an open, expansive game, which will suit both teams. \nThe Wallabies are known for their slick backline play, and the Pumas are gaining a similar reputation after years of playing 10-man rugby based on forward grunt. \nIt remains to be seen if Argentina reverts to type to combat Australia but scrumhalf Martin Landajo couldn't have been more clear. \n\"We cannot go back to our forwards game,\" Landajo said. \"We don't know how to do that anymore.\" \nThe teams have arrived at Twickenham. \n1:55 p.m. \nAs far as All Blacks coach Steve Hansen is concerned, Richie McCaw's off-the-ball contact with South Africa's Francois Louw in New Zealand's 20-18 Rugby World Cup semifinal win is a non-issue. \nVideo of the first-half incident spread quickly on social media on Saturday night, with McCaw appearing to run into Louw, who was kneeling, as he ran around a ruck. \n\"Nothing in it, so there's nothing to talk about,\" Hansen told a Sunday news conference. \"Everyone's got a bit excited, so move on.\" \nAfter the game, Hansen praised 147-test veteran McCaw as \"probably the greatest player we've ever seen.\" \n1:40 p.m. \nArgentina soccer great Diego Maradona promised he'd be back to watch the Pumas if they reached the Rugby World Cup semifinals. \nIt looks like he's keeping his word. \nWorld Rugby says Maradona is expected to attend the World Cup semifinal between Argentina and Australia at Twickenham on Sunday. Argentina is aiming to advance to the final for the first time. \nMaradona was in the crowd at Leicester for Argentina's pool-stage win over Tonga last month. He went into the Pumas' changing room after the game, and sang and danced with players. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:40:30.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
