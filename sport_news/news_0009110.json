Olave was shown a red card, sent off and the home team finished with 10 players.\nMelano was back defending against a Salt Lake corner kick when he suffered an apparent shoulder injury when he went up for a ball against Justen Glad; he eventually came off in favor of George Fochive as the Timbers assumed a more defensive look in the final 27 minutes.\nPortland goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey earned his 13th clean sheet of the season and had two significant saves near the end of the game -- one in stoppage time off of a deflection -- to preserve the win.\nWith the victory, the Timbers move above the red line -- into a fifth-place tie with the Seattle Sounders at the moment -- and put themselves in a much better position to slide into the Western Conference playoffs. They've been vying with Real Salt Lake (11-13-8, 41 points) and the San Jose Earthquakes (12-12-8, 44) in the last couple of weeks as Major League Soccer's regular season winds down.\nIn their two previous league games this season, Salt Lake and Portland played to a 0-0 draw and the Timbers won 1-0.\nThat may be why, for this match, Porter crafted a starting lineup with a go-for-broke offense. For the first time this season, the top of the formation was Melano Adi, Darlington Nagbe , Rodney Wallace and Diego Valeri , with Diego Chara the lone defensive midfielder.\n\"Sometimes you get it right,\" Porter said. \"The players deserve all the credit.\n\"In the first half, we came out aggressive, we came out to attack,\" Porter added. \"Obviously, our lineup and game plan reflected that.\"\nThe Timbers' scoring woes have been well chronicled this season and this attack packed a punch.\nThe Timbers have two games remaining â€” Sunday at the second-place LA Galaxy and on Oct. 25 at home against the last-place Colorado Rapids at Providence Park.\nPortland will have to go without Alvas Powell against the the Galaxy. He's suspended on a yellow-card accumulation after he was booked in the 28th minute against Salt Lake. LA have already clinched a playoff spot but are still in the hunt for the Supporters Shield.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:18:35.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
