(SOUNDBITE) (English) MANCHESTER CITY MANAGER MANUEL PELLEGRINI SAYING: \"We came here for the three points and we tried in the first half to score. We have, not clear clear chances but we have more attempts than United did. In the second half it was not our intention because I don't like to play in that way but for different reasons we started losing the ball and United started having good possession, they have very good and technical players and so you must be very concentrating when you're defending, you must play with high intensity because it is normal that one or two balls decide the games.\" 7. WHITE FLASH 8.

WHITE FLASH 10. PELLEGRINI LEAVING NEWS CONFERENCE STORY: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini lamented having to defend in depth in his side's 0-0 draw at rivals Manchester United on Sunday (October 25) but said he was happy to claim a point. United and City played out a dour 0-0 draw at Old Trafford that was short on entertainment as well as chances with both sides cancelling each other out. United came closest to breaking the deadlock in the closing stages when substitute Jesse Lingard hit the crossbar and defender Chris Smalling forced a smart save from City keeper Joe Hart. City boss Manuel Pellegrini was happy to have claimed a draw at the home of their rivals but not satisfied with his team's performance. \"I think that we have a good draw in a difficult stadium. I think that we played better maybe in the first half, in the second half we lose so many balls it was impossible to create many chances but as a team if we need to defend we can defend,\" said Pellegrini. \"It's easy to defend with 10 players behind the ball near your box, it's easy. For me it's not the way to do it but if you cannot find the space and you are not clear with the ball you must try to do it well and I think we did it well. \"One point here is not bad, we continue at the lead of the table and we try to continue next game to play again in the way that we normally do, as we did in the first half.\" Press CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the code http://reut.rs/1O2d2YQ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:10:15.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
