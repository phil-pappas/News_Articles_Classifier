This is due to a confession from the killer, but the grisly details of this killing was not easy for her mother to hear. YouTube screen shot Carrie Ann Jopek was 17 when she went missing and her death had not only been haunting her mother, but apparently her killer too. A reporter for a local television station received a call from a man confessing to the killing of Carrie Jopek 33 years after she was murdered.\nAccording to The Washington Post on October 19, Carrie was suspended from school on the last day she was ever seen alive back in 1982. Her mother, Carolyn Tousignant, received a call from the school informing her that her daughter Carrie was suspended. The school asked if Tousignant would like to come and get her.\nWhat Tousignant said next has haunted her for 33 years. She told the school to let her walk the block home and with that, Carrie was gone, never to be seen again. The reporter from WISN News 12 in Milwaukee picked up the phone last week to hear a very somber and detailed murder and rape confession from 50-year-old Jose Ferreira. He was a man who grew up in the neighborhood who was known to Carrie and her family.\nAccording to Uproxx News , police arrested Ferreira on a second-degree murder charge for the death of Carrie Ann Jopek, and he also confessed to having sex with her dead body. Carrie Ann had gone to a party and the two made their way into the basement to be alone, but Carrie Ann changed her mind while at the top of the stairs. Ferreira said he got mad and pushed her and she fell down the stairs, breaking her neck.\nAt first Ferreira said he thought she just passed out so he had sex with her. When he realized she was dead he wrapped her in a plastic bag and buried her under a porch. Carrie Ann’s body was found two years after she had gone missing under a porch at a house in her neighborhood.\nShe had been dead two years when her body was discovered and there wasn’t any viable DNA to work with, so the murder remained unsolved. Ferreira was haunted by this death for a long time, as witnesses reported to police years ago he was seen crying over the spot where her body was unearthed under that porch.\nHe was questioned during Carrie Ann’s murder investigation, but denied knowing anything about it and there wasn’t any evidence to pin it on the then 17-year-old boy people called “Junior.” Discovering that the murder of her daughter had been solved was bitter-sweet to Tousignant.\nCarrie's mom knows today that her daughter wasn’t abducted coming home from school that day. She also feels her daughter would have gone to that party even if her mother had picked her up at school that day. Knowing the grisly details of what Ferreira did to her daughter’s dead body was not something easy to hear, but knowing her killer is now paying for what he did, does bring her some type of closure.", "external_links": ["http://uproxx.com/webculture/2015/10/man-arrested-30-year-old-murder/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/19/haunting-murder-mystery-apparently-solved-after-33-years-when-man-calls-tv-station-to-confess/"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:26:42.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
