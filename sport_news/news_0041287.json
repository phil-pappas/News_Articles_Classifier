However, according to the sheriff's office, the 6-foot-10 Odom's stature made it impossible for him to be transported by air.\nInstead, an ambulance took Odom to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas for further treatment.\nThe Lakers are playing an exhibition game against the Sacramento Kings in Las Vegas. Word that Odom had been hospitalized quickly spread through the locker room, with team staffers scrambling to find out which area hospital the 35-year-old Odom was taken to.\nTeam spokesman John Black said he was aware of the report, but did not have any more information. He said the team was “monitoring is as best we can and, yes, concerned.”\nKings forward Caron Butler, who was Odom's teammate in Miami and L.A. from 2003-05, shared a hug with a Lakers staffer and said, “Prayers up.”\nOdom played for the Lakers from 2004-11, and, along with current Lakers Kobe Bryant and Metta World Peace, was a member of their championship teams in 2009 and 2010.\nHe was drafted fourth overall by the Clippers in 1999 and left in 2004 to sign a free agent contract with the Miami Heat. The Heat traded Odom to the Lakers in a deal for Shaquille O'Neal, starting a long and, eventually successful, partnership with Bryant and the Lakers.\nIn seven seasons with the Lakers he averaged 13.7 points and 9.5 rebounds. He was named the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year in 2011.\nHis departure from the Lakers eventually came after L.A. tried to trade him in the nixed deal for Chris Paul. He was sent to Dallas before the start of the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season.\nHe last appeared in the NBA with the Clippers in 2012-13, playing all 82 games.\nOdom married reality star Khloe Kardashian in 2009, but the pair split in December 2013 after the basketball player’s alleged drug and alcohol use put an added strain on their relationship.\nHe told InTouch magazine that Kardashian was his “soulmate” but the two finalized their divorce in July, ending their four-year marriage.\nOdom’s life has been filled with tragedy. After his mother died of colon cancer when he was 13 years old, he went to live with his grandmother.\nIn 2006, his 6 1/2-month son, Jaden, died from SIDS and Odom was involved in an automobile accident in which a cyclist died. This past summer, two of his close friends – producer Bobby Heyward and Jamie Sangouthai – died a week apart of drug-related causes.\nStaff writer Janis Carr contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:41:04.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
