(By: Andy Shupe) (Credit: NWA Democrat-Gazette) \nLuke Hannon wore both numbers Friday night after tearing up his jersey in the first half, and the senior running back tore the Bulldogs for the entire game. \nHannon rushed for four touchdowns and caught a touchdown pass to lead No. 2 Har-Ber to a 47-43 victory over No. 1 Fayetteville in a 7A-West Conference showdown at Wildcat Stadium. \nFayetteville took the lead in the fourth quarter before Trey Smith won it for Har-Ber on a 6-yard touchdown catch from Fuller Chandler with 6 seconds remaining. \nHar-Ber (6-1, 4-0) now leads in the 7A-West Conference after posting consecutive victories over Fayetteville (6-1, 3-1) and defending Class 7A state champion Bentonville. \n\"It's always great to win games in the 7A-West,\" Har-Ber Coach Chris Wood said following his team's sixth consecutive victory. \"They're a cherished prize. We'll take it, but no one remembers what happens in October. You've got to win games in November and December.\" \nHannon had the best game of his career with 318 yards rushing on 45 carries. He also scored on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Fuller Chandler to end the first half. Chandler lofted the ball high and it appeared a Fayetteville defender was going to come down with the Bulldogs' third interception of the half, but Hannon took the ball away from a Fayetteville defender. \n\"Luke Hannon is a special talent,\" Wood said. \"He's a game-changer, and we want the ball in his hands.\" \nHannon scored twice in the third quarter on runs of 1 and 18 yards to put Har-Ber ahead 33-29. But Fayetteville took a 43-40 lead with 5:48 left in the fourth quarter after two touchdown runs by Javontae Smith. \nHar-Ber marched methodically downfield behind Hannon, who had a 17-yard catch on the drive. Hannon ran for 15 yards before Chandler found Smith alone in the middle of the end zone for the winning touchdown. \n\"That was a great drive,\" Fayetteville Coach Daryl Patton said. \"You have to tip your hat to them. They're a great football team. That was a hell of a game.\" \nFayetteville's potent offense began to kick in after the Bulldogs trailed 14-8 after one quarter. Taylor Powell completed his second touchdown pass to Tyson Morris before Luke Rapert scored on an 18-yard run to give Fayetteville a 22-14 lead. \nThat score looked like it was going to stand until Hannon came down with the 28-yard pass from Chandler to pull the Wildcats to within 22-20 going into halftime. \nHar-Ber led 14-8 after one quarter on a 17-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Blackston and a 7-yard touchdown run from Hannon, who had 132 yards rushing in the first half despite a slow start. Jesus Zizumbo missed a 29-yard field goal after Blackston had a touchdown catch called back because of a penalty on an ineligible player down field. \nTyson Morris scored Fayetteville's first touchdown on a 21-yard catch, and the Bulldogs went ahead 8-7 on a two-point conversion pass by Powell. Har-Ber regained the lead after a juggling 57-yard reception by Dalton Douangdara gave the Wildcats a first down at the Fayetteville 5. \nSports on 10/17/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:07.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
