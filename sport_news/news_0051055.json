It is the worst home loss in Snyder's KSU career.\nAfter the game, the 24-year Kansas State coach sent out a letter to KSU students.\n\"Please accept my apology for for the manner in which we represented you on Saturday. I know you are pained by the outcome, as I am. I hope that you will appreciate our players for never giving up  even in the face of such adversity.\"\nThe Cats lost their starting quarterback on the first play of the 2015 season opener, then lost their second stringer weeks later. That's left them with a third-string QB and a wide receiver as their only quarterbacks.\nKansas State was held to just 5 of 22 passing for a paltry 45 yards, and three interceptions. \nThe loss drops the Cats to 0-3 in the Big 12, 3-3 overall.\nThey host number-2 ranked Baylor on Saturday.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
