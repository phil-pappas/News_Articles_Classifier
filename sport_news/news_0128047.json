The emerging ace with the electric stuff. The relentlessly upbeat manager. The giddy relief that comes with washing away years of futility.\nAndrew McCutchen has seen this script before.\nTwo years ago, it was the star center fielder and the rest of the Pittsburgh Pirates who found themselves as baseball's new darlings when they crashed the playoffs for the first time in two decades.\nNow it's the Chicago Cubs, whose rebuilding project hit warp speed somewhere between Joe Maddon's hire last winter and rookie slugger Kris Bryant's arrival in April.\n\"They've opened a lot of eyes,\" McCutchen said. \"We were the hype in 2013. Look at what we did. Everybody was on us. ... Now it's 'Let's talk about the Cubs.' \"\nThe Pirates can change the subject quickly Wednesday night in the NL wild-card game. The winner meets the St. Louis Cardinals in the division series starting Friday.\nThe clubs that combined for 195 wins both believe they can make a run provided they can survive baseball's version of a high-wire coin flip.\nHeady territory for two franchises that have spent most of this millennium taking turns at the bottom of the NL Central.\nThose days have long since passed in Pittsburgh, making its third straight playoff appearance. The Cubs hope to say the same thing in Chicago regardless of a history filled with curses and a World Series drought at 107 years and counting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T10:35:38.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
