Laughably unsuccessful. \n“And they called the damn thing against the Patriots, a well-coached team,” Mike Westhoff, an NFL special-teams coach for 30 years before retiring in 2013, told the Sun in a phone interview on Monday. \n“The Patriots were playing punt-safe. I’ve gone against them a million times. I know what the hell they do.” \nTom Brady and the Patriots offence subsequently needed just six plays to move 35 yards and score what turned out to be the winning touchdown in a 34-27 victory. \nWesthoff is even more perplexed by the failed fake than you or me. \nLet’s go over the play. \nAs the accompanying frame-grab shows, the Colts shifted out of a regular punt setup and into this travesty of a trick formation. Receiver Griff Whalen acted as centre, with safety Colt Anderson playing quarterback, hands under centre. The other nine Colts, including punter Pat McAfee, were arrayed far out to the right. \nFirst off, they’re lined up illegally -- egregiously so. After the play, Indy was properly flagged for it. \nIn the NFL, seven players must be situated along the line on every scrimmage play, even punts. The Colts had only one man on the line: the receiver-turned-centre, Whalen. Maybe two, if you think the player flexed farthest to the right is lined up forward enough. \nThe clump of five Colts in between probably was supposed to be on the line too, but either those five players all screwed up together, or they were never coached to line up on the scrimmage line in the first place. They’re a good yard-and-a-half too far back. \n“You have to designate someone -- your right-end guy, whoever that is,” Westhoff said. “He makes sure he’s lined up right, and he makes sure all his buddies to the left are lined up properly with him, as he looks down the line, so that you’re clearly distinguishing who’s on the line and who isn’t … The rule states that your helmet has to break the centre’s belt. That’s what being on the line is. \n“You don’t want the official to ever look down that line and (be unsure).” \nThen the bigger screwup. \nPagano probably was hoping the Patriots would jump offside. Or that they’d have taken the bait and moved en masse to cover all the bodies flexed out wide, so that a quarterback sneak against one or two leftover defenders would have gained at least three yards. \nBut as the frame-grab shows, the Patriots instead spread themselves along the line, more or less evenly, with three bunched in front of Whalen. No sneak would work. \nAlternatively, Pagano suggested afterward, the hope was the Patriots might panic, substitute incorrectly and wind up with too many players on the field at once -- an automatic blown whistle and a five-yard penalty, which would have given Indy a first down too. \n“When you run a trick play or formation like that, you need to have a specific, achievable goal in mind,” Westhoff said. “It shouldn’t be that you hope you draw them offside, or hope you get them to make a substitution error. I think that’s totally naïve … It’s BS.” \nAs it was, with the play clock ticking down, and the Patriots not screwing up either in number or in alignment, Whalen inexplicably decided to snap the ball anyway. To Anderson. \nWesthoff said it had to have been Whalen’s decision to snap it, not Anderson’s. \n“I’m sure that quarterback didn’t want the damn ball. He’s standing there looking at three guys!” Westhoff said. \nActually, five Patriots were nearby. \n“Trust me, he doesn’t want the ball,” Westhoff said. “He knows his ass is getting kicked.” \nIt was. \nFive Patriots swarmed Anderson the moment he received the snap, with four more Patriots on the way, before any of the nine faraway Colts got anywhere near the action. \nLoss of two yards. The Patriots declined the illegal-formation penalty and took over. Game essentially over. \nPagano blamed the messed-up play on miscommunications. Which, yeah, obviously. \n“I used to have a sign in my office,” Westhoff said, “that read, ‘If it can be misunderstood, it will be misunderstood.’ I think it’s senseless to put guys in that kind of position, when what you’re expecting to gain from it is so miniscule: a first down. \n“Who the hell do you think you’re playing against? Everybody uses a punt-safe. Most everybody will even just leave their defence on the field (on fourth-and-short). \n“The point is, why do it when the risk is much, much greater than the reward?” \nPagano likely will be answering that, and for that, with his job, unless his Colts go deep into the playoffs and knock off the Patriots in the process. \nTRENDS NOT COINCIDENCES \nIt happened again, so it will probably happen again \n1. The Jets lead the NFL both in rushing offence and total defence. That combo will keep winning games for you. \n2. Atlanta Falcons RB Devonta Freeman is a scoring machine. He far and away leads the NFL with 10 TDs scored already. He’s gaining yards too; Atlanta is fourth in the league in rushing. Ride this guy if you have him. \n3. Not only is DeAndre Hopkins now the unquestioned No. 1 receiver in Houston (with Andre Johnson in Indy), he’s setting records as his talents blossom. Hopkins leads the league in total yards from scrimmage (726), in receiving yards (726) and in third-down catches (15). And Sunday he became the first NFLer ever with at least nine catches and 145 receiving yards in three consecutive games. \nSTAT OF THE WEEK \nColin Kaepernick passed for 340 yards in San Francisco’s 25-20 defeat of Baltimore. \nDid you think he was even capable of it anymore? I had my doubts. \nIt had been 53 weeks since the fifth-year NFLer passed for as many yards; he had 343 against St. Louis on Oct. 13, 2014. \nHis only other career game with as many yards came in San Fran’s 2013 opening-day win at Green Bay, when he had a career-high 412. \nSince last November, it seemed Kaepernick was incapable of throwing for as many yards again -- at least in a victory. \nIn a stat-padding opportunity (that is, in a big loss, such as at Pittsburgh in September)? Maybe. But the Niners needed Kap to throw like mad on Sunday to win, because the Ravens shut down San Fran’s run game -- holding it to 65 yards. \nBaltimore’s secondary is terrible this season, so you might think 340 yards is no big accomplishment. But if Kaepernick is ever to yank his career out of the quicksand, he needs to pass -- not run -- his way out it. \nIf Kaepernick is successful, Sunday’s performance might go down as a noteworthy turning point. \nHERO \nLandry Jones, QB, Steelers. \nThe third-year third-stringer entered Sunday’s game against Arizona in the third quarter, with Pittsburgh trailing 10-6. Jones had barely ever played, but in subbing for injured Michael Vick (who was subbing for injured Ben Roethlisberger), Jones surprisingly led the Steelers to four scores in the final 25 minutes, including his first two career TD passes (both to Martavis Bryant) in Pittsburgh’s big comeback win. \nZERO \nJim Irsay, owner, Colts. \nThat head coach Chuck Pagano is even fighting for his job is ludicrous, really, coming off an AFC championship game appearance, two consecutive South division titles and three straight 11-5 records. Who’s making it clear by his silence that talk of Pagano being doomed is true? Why Irsay, the world’s No. 1 Patriots Hater. That Pagano coached with such desperation on Sunday night -- to get the boss off his back and finally defeat New England -- is surely the reason Pagano approved that cockamamie fake punt in the first place. \nSTOCK UP \nCam Newton, QB, Panthers. \nSuperman’s Kryptonite for four years had been the Seahawks defence, which always make him look ordinary and unready for elitism. But on Sunday, Newton almost singlehandedly rallied the Panthers for two TDs in the final four minutes, to remain unbeaten. It was no fluke. Newton was 20-of-36 for 269 yards. \nSTOCK DOWN \nArizona Cardinals. \nMaybe it’s just temporary. But suddenly the Cards have lost two winnable games in a row. Carson Palmer and the offence have sputtered in the second half, and the defence has leaked big plays. \nACTUAL QUOTE \n“It was bull----. I think it should be taken out of the game. It’s not the way you play football. I think it was done with the idea of trying to hurt our quarterback, and that’s bull---- football.” -- Tennessee Titans head coach Ken Whisenhunt, after Marcus Mariota took a low hit from Miami pass rusher Olivier Vernon, leaving the rookie QB with a brace on his left knee afterward. \nACTUAL TWEET \n“Ya need to get off Peyton that’s our QB bottom line. You fake fans don’t say anything when he is winning us the game smh” -- Broncos RB Ronnie Hillman (@MrHillman2U), on the ever louder criticism of QB Peyton Manning even from fans in Denver. \nQUARTERBACK RANKINGS \nMy Top 20, tweaked after Sunday games (last week’s rankings in brackets) \n1.

He suffered a concussion two weeks ago. \nFIVE FAST FACTS \n1. Peyton Manning’s team is 6-0 for the sixth time in his career. \n2. Aaron Rodgers reached the 30,000-yard milestone faster than any NFL QB -- in 43 fewer attempts than Johnny Unitas. \n3.

The lowest passer rating of any NFL starter? Manning’s 72.5 in Denver. \nKNOW YOUR HISTORY \nThis week is the 76th anniversary of the first televised pro football game. On Oct. 22, 1939 the Philadelphia Eagles lost 23-14 to the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field.

I can pick a team only once all season, so 32 teams over the NFL schedule’s final 16 weeks. Last week’s picks: Carolina (which won at Seattle) and Indianapolis (which lost to New England). This week’s picks: Oakland (at San Diego) and New York Jets (at New England). \nSeason record: 7-3. \nTAKING A KNEE \nThis week’s winder-upper \nBills defensive end Mario Williams is to be admired for the way he subtly, respectfully expressed frustration with the passive, ill-suited (my words) defensive schemes that new head coach Rex Ryan has been calling since Buffalo’s Week 2 loss to New England. \nI’ll admit I’ve been one who has looked at his occasional sack droughts over the past four seasons and wondered if they’re because of inconsistent effort on his part. \nThis thought, however, occurred after Buffalo’s latest, toothless defensive effort against Cincinnati on Sunday: a player -- even a $100-million super sacker such as Williams -- can only achieve the bellwether markers we media or fans use to gauge their effectiveness if his coaches put him in the position to make them. \nTo this point, Williams said to a handful of reporters after Sunday’s loss that he’s not being asked to rush the passer as much as in years past. \n“I probably set a (personal) record on dropping (into coverage) today,” he said. \nWhat was impressive is that every time Williams came anywhere near the point of coming across as a complaining prima donna, he stopped short. It was clear he did not want to throw his coach under the bus, nor appear to be anything other than a respectful, compliant, fully on-board player. \nHe will faithfully do, and can only do, what he’s asked to do. \nIn so doing, Williams still got his important point across, between the lines. That a quarter-billion-dollars worth of Pro Bowl pass-rushing talent on hand perhaps should be better utilized. \nHe’s right. And he did it the right way. \nTill next week ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:54:13.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
