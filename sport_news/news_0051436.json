Leon Mackey, who joined the practice roster on Oct. 6, will make his CFL debut and first start in Anderson’s place.\n“It was always a plan from the start to give Zach a rest periodically, too,” head coach Mike O’Shea said Friday. “We haven’t been good at that either lately. I’m not saying he needs it, but it was always part of the plan.”\nIt looks like the roster change is being done in an effort to put more pressure on Burris, who sliced and diced the Bombers last week en route to a 27-24 victory at TD Place. Mackey is a trim 6-foot-5 and 260 pounds, while Anderson is more of a nose tackle prototype at 6-foot-3 and 297 pounds.\nSince the Bombers have been on the road the last two weeks and practice roster players don’t travel, Mackey has never seen a CFL game live.\n“My first game live will be the one I’m in,” Mackey said. “So that’s a blessing. I’m a positive energy, and I’m an optimistic type of guy. I’ve been knocked down a lot of times in life, and I always feel like regardless of what you go through it’s all about you. I don’t put too much pressure on myself. I just go.”\nBUCKNOR IS BOMBERS GOOD GUY\nIn the end, what happens on the football field doesn’t really matter that much in the big picture.\nThat’s why Matt Bucknor will be able to feel good about the 2015 season no matter how it ends.\nThe Bombers starting strong side cornerback was named the team’s winner of the Ed Kotowich Good Guy Award on Friday for combining football ability, team camaraderie and extraordinary effort in the community.\n“I am honoured to be the recipient of the Ed Kotowich award,” Bucknor said in a press release. “I enjoy giving back to the community that we are all a part of as Winnipeg Blue Bombers.”\nBucknor, a 30-year-old Hamilton native, has been heavily involved in the team’s community projects since he was traded to the Blue and Gold prior to last season. Bucknor takes part in many school and community visits throughout the year, and he is also involved in a youth mentorship program in his hometown. Bucknor plans to bring the same mentorship program to Winnipeg this winter.\nPrevious winners of the Good Guy Award in recent years include Chris Greaves, Henoc Muamba, Chris Cvetkovic and Buck Pierce.\nKotowich played on the offensive line for the Bombers between 1955 and 1961, winning three Grey Cups. He continued to coach football in Winnipeg after his retirement, and he even served as a St. Boniface city councillor. He also heavily involved in many community programs in Winnipeg.\nBUSY, BUSY\nTroy Stoudermire is Winnipeg’s jack of all trades, playing on all three sides of the ball, but he insists he’s not wearing down.\nStoudermire’s primary job is to return kicks and punts, but he also serves as Winnipeg’s fifth receiver and extra defensive back in certain situations. He has seven catches for 34 yards, one rush for two yards, an interception, five tackles and three special teams tackles. The poor guy can never sit down during games, because his name could be called on every play.\n“I was talking to Nick (Moore) about that,” Stoudermire said. “I was like, man, how do you take your helmet off during the game? I leave mine on the whole entire game.”\nBE AWARE\nThe Bombers will be wearing pink all over their uniforms on Saturday to raise awareness for women’s cancers.\nLinebacker Tony Burnett was chosen as the team’s spokesman for the initiative because his grandmother, Doretha Johnson, is a breast cancer survivor.\n“She’s very close to me,” Burnett said.\n“I grew up around her my whole life, so when it happened it was devastating. But now that she’s beating it it’s made life a lot easier.”\nJohnson was diagnosed in 2001 and then again in 2007, when she had a double mastectomy.\n“She’s cancer free now, so that’s a blessing,” Burnett said.\n“Just to have your grandparents around, and especially for her to overcome breast cancer, it’s a big thing. She’s someone I look up to for strength. She’s always cheering me on and gives me motivation to play.”\nSAYING BYE\nThe Bombers have the bye next week before returning for their final regular season contest in Toronto on Nov. 6.\nThat’s bad news for them on Saturday, because the Blue and Gold have lost four straight games before a bye week. That includes their 27-20 loss to Toronto on Aug. 14.\nSince 2002, the Bombers are 6-12 in games before the bye.\nLATE HITS\nLeft tackle Stanley Bryant didn’t take part in the team’s walk through on Friday at rainy IGF, but the club maintains he will be back in time for Saturday’s game. He’s been in the U.S. dealing with a personal issue ... The last time a CFL team from Ottawa won a game in Winnipeg was on July 17, 2004 ... Winnipeg’s last four games have been decided by three points or fewer. The last time that happened was to Saskatchewan in 1987 ... A victory on Saturday would give Ottawa its first 10-win season since 1978 ... The forecast calls for sunny skies and a high of 10 C.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nBLUE BOMBERS\nBlue Bombers bulk up for Burris\nBy Kirk Penton , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Friday, October 23, 2015 08:45 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 23, 2015 09:00 PM EDT\nRedBlacks quarterback Henry Burris better have his running shoes on Saturday afternoon, because the Bombers will be coming after him.\nWinnipeg defensive tackle Zach Anderson, who has started all 16 games this season and has been with the team for three years, will be a healthy scratch in the critical contest.
