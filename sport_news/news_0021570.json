(AP Photo) Comments \nIn last season's game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton passed for 306 yards and two touchdowns. But he also threw three interceptions and took the pounding of his NFL life. The Eagles sacked the former Auburn star nine times in a 40-25 victory over Carolina. \nThe Eagles and Panthers square off again at 7:30 p.m. CDT Sunday. \nThis year, the pounding might be the other way around, Philadelphia coach Chip Kelly said. \n\"The challenge is they are going to try to pound you,\" Kelly said , \"and they have got a back in Jonathan (Stewart) who is a big, physical, downhill running back. And then you have a quarterback â€“ and it's different than other zone-read-type teams you face where it's a quick, agile quarterback that's going to break outside -- in Cam, who can pound you, too. He's got to be the biggest quarterback in the league from that standpoint in terms of rushing -- him and (Pittsburgh's Ben) Roethlisberger. But they don't run Ben. They run Cam. So I think they are just going to try to wear you down and pound you a little bit.\" \nThat wasn't the case last season when the teams faced off in the 10 th week of the season. Offseason ankle surgery and a fractured rib suffered in the preseason had Newton at less than his best during 2014. Against the Eagles, he rushed two times for 6 yards. \n\"When you wake up and still get treatment ... just to make it to Sunday,\" Newton said , remembering the beating he took last season in Philadelphia, \"and after Sunday, get enough treatment just to do what I want. Toe, ankle, rib, wisdom teeth, back, thumb, wrist -- it was everything. But through it all, still found ways (to play).\" \nThis season, Newton has guided Carolina to a 5-0 record to extend its regular-season winning streak to eight games. In addition to throwing for eight touchdowns, Newton has rushed 50 times for 225 yards and three TDs while absorbing 10 sacks this season. \nRELATED: IS CAM NEWTON THE NFL'S MVP SO FAR THIS SEASON? \n\"Cam had an ankle injury last year,\" Kelly said during his Wednesday press conference. \"He looks like he's really healthy this year. I think the game will express itself in a different manner. ... We haven't spent a lot of time looking at last year just because I don't think Cam was at 100 percent last year when we played them.\" \nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE \nThe Eagles-Panthers game at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C., will be broadcast by NBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:52:54.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
