The Jayhawks won 1-0. Posted: Sunday, October 11, 2015 5:13 pm Ashley Williams seals second straight late win for Kansas soccer Skylar Rolstad | @SkyRolSports kansan.com Overtime loomed for both Kansas and Oklahoma as Ashley Williams dribbled down the right side of the field. There were less than 80 seconds remaining in regulation at Rock Chalk Park. In dramatic fashion once again, Williams and the Jayhawks finally broke through, as her shot hit the opposite side netting to give Kansas a 1-0 win. “We never quit. It comes down to having heart and soul and wanting to score and finish the game,” Williams said after the game. “I think we’re sick of going into overtime.” On Friday, the Jayhawks won 1-0 in the last 11 seconds of their match against Baylor, which went into two overtimes. The Sooners also played into overtime on Friday, a 0-0 draw against West Virginia in Norman, Okla. Grace Hagan assisted Williams’ goal. Hagan played a long ball up the field for Williams to run onto. The assist was Hagan’s second on the season. “I think that this year’s group has a tremendous mentality,” Kansas coach Mark Francis said after the game. “That’s why we’re in the situation we’re in right now.” With the win, the Jayhawks have now won six of their last seven matches. Sunday’s win was made sweeter by the Kansas’ overcoming of a competitive rival. Oklahoma defeated Kansas twice last season by a 1-0 score, once in the regular season and again in the Big 12 tournament. Williams began the game well, with a clear shot on goal that missed wide right. Liana Salazar nearly scored in the 63rd minute when she lunged for the ball past Oklahoma goalkeeper Kassidie Stade. Salazar’s shot hit the post and bounced away for a corner kick. Salazar also made several key passes during the game, one of which put Ashley Williams in on goal during the second half. “[Salazar has] been unbelievable. teams man mark and double team her and she still finds a way to get open and create space for herself and her teammates,” Francis said. “She’s just a different-level player.” \nNext Friday, Oct. 16, the Jayhawks will travel to Morgantown, Va., to take on the conference-leading West Virginia Mountaineers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:51:56.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
