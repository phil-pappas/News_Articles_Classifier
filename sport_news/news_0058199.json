Christopher Winter of the Oklahoma City Thunder asked Yahoo. \"Bet the farm on Buffalo. That's absurd. Why did (the Jaguars) do that?\"\nThe reason the Bills need more time to get adjusted is because the game will be played at 9:30 a.m. eastern time, which isn't the body's best time for athletic performance. That's why it's important to get players adjusted to London time, so the 2:30 p.m. local kickoff feels like 2:30 p.m.\n\"You would want to travel east as quickly as possible,\" Winter said. \"The later you travel, the more it feels like the game is going to happen and it is going to feel like a very early game for them.\"\nRex Ryan said the Bills had the option of coming to London later in the week but decided to get themselves acclimated a bit earlier.\n\"You know I talked to a lot of people who have done this trip before and obviously I went with being advised to go a week early, give them the two days, and that's exactly what we did,\" Ryan said. \"So we'll see how it goes. I just felt even for me after the first day I was like, 'Wow, you know the time change is a factor.' And so as some of you guys maybe just came in, it's what, about two in the morning right now or whatever it is? So that's a difference. I just think getting here for the entire week and get your body clock a chance to reset itself and be ready to go. So that's why we did what we did.\"\nThe players appreciated it, too. Center Eric Wood said he felt like his body was adjusted by the time he took the field for practice Wednesday.\n\"That Monday night trying to get to bed and still feeling like you're on east coast time was pretty tough,\" Wood said. \"That was probably the toughest thing for me was just trying to adjust sleep-wise. I don't know how it would be the other way, but I wouldn't want to feel how I felt Monday later in the week, that's for sure.\"\nThe Bills are already favored against the Jaguars , and if you listen to the sleep experts, maybe the spread should be even bigger than 4.", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sleep-specialist-forecasts-bills-victory-after-looking-at-jags--london-travel-plans-144518876.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:43:25.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
