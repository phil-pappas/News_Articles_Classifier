We just worry about ourselves and try and make our game better each week.” \nHe remained unfazed about the dual ball-hunters reducing the threats in the Wallabies’ lineout. \n“I’ve been in plenty of situations where we haven’t had many jumpers and been in other situations where you have lots of jumpers,” he said. \n“You don’t always have a great lineout with five jumpers and you can sometimes have a really good lineout with one jumper. \n“It just comes down to doing your research and make sure you do the right calls and try and make it as easy as possible for the team.” \nHooper, who faces a two-week ban after being cited for alleged foul play over an incident in which he cleared England fullback Mike Brown out of a ruck, was used to great effect in Saturday’s victory at Twickenham. \nSimmons said the `Pooper’ combination of Pocock and Hooper was improving every time they took the field. \n“It looked pretty good on the weekend. It’s just getting better and better,” he said. \n“Those two are working each other out and I think they’ve got a pretty good combination going.” \nAustralian hooker Stephen Moore threw short to Hooper several times as the Wallabies managed to tweak their style to accommodate their twin No.7s – an approach they may continue to use as the tournament progresses. \nWhen asked whether the tactic worked primarily as teams weren’t looking at him as a primary jumper, Simmons replied: “They might have to start doing it if they look at the stats on the weekend.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:31:58.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
