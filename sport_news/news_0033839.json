But last night's 17-12 loss to Washington led to Trojans coach Steve Sarkisian being booed off the field.\nDan Wolken of USA Today wrote that it is time for USC to pull the plug on Sarkisian and hire Kelly.\nSarkisian coached at Washington before bailing for the USC job. Former Boise State coach Chris Petersen succeeded him in Seattle, and a lot of people think the Huskies wound up with the better head coach.\nTake a gander at these opinion pieces written in the wake of last night's game:\nMatt Calkins of the Seattle Times: Washington's coaching upgrade was on full display in the Los Angeles Coliseum.\nChris Dufresne of the Los Angeles Times: The Trojans looked shoddy, sloppy and unprepared while losing to Washington.\nJeff Miller of the Orange County Register: Sarkisian was outcoached and USC was outplayed.\nStewart Mandel of FoxSports.com: For USC to be great, Sarkisian needs to go.\nPete Thamel of SI.com: Sarkisian was the wrong choice for USC.\nScott Wolf of the Los Angeles Daily News: Losses to double-digit underdogs are coming to define the Sarkisian era at USC.\nI would keep an eye on developments.\nAnd I know this: Kelly becoming USC's coach is a nightmare scenario for the rest of the Pac-12.\nOK, more links:\nThe UO defense seeks to build off of the improvement shown last week.\nOregon's offensive linemen look back on a woeful performance last year at Washington State.\nIf the Ducks know what they're going to do with their quarterbacks against Washington State, they aren't saying.\nOregon's quarterback quandary -- how do you replace a superstar?\nAaron Fentress of CSNNW.com: Touted redshirt freshman Morgan Mahalak is behind the other quarterbacks, but that doesn't mean he won't develop.\nR-G analyst Ken Woody: What's happened to Oregon's \"Blur\" offense?\nThe O's Andrew Greif riffs on the Ducks in this Q-and-A with the Spokesman-Review.\nThe O's five things to watch in the Oregon-WSU game.\nESPN.com's Chantel Jennings, who picked Wazzu to win, also has five things to watch in the WSU-Oregon game.\nUO receiver Jalen Brown picks up where Keanon Lowe left off.\nAn alarming number of Oregon mainstays are being injured on special teams.\nOregon's Devon Allen talks about elevators, quarterbacks and injury recovery in this R-G Q-and-A.\nThe wait has been worth it for talented UO redshirt freshman Tony Brooks-James.\nThe improving WSU run defense zeroes in on UO running back Royce Freeman.\nThe first step on Aidan Schneider's journey to becoming an FBS kicker was responding to a text message.\nOregon coach Mark Helfrich got a big bump in pay , but he's still not one of the 25 highest-paid college coaches.\nA must-win game for the Oregon Ducks; it's one of my three things to watch this week in college football.\nPicking against the spread, the Merc's Jon Wilner likes both Oregon and Arizona.\nSaturday's game at Arizona is a prime opportunity for the youthful Beavers.\nThe OSU defense is set up to defend a steady diet of spread offenses.\nAnonymous ESPN source says Anu Solomon will start at quarterback for Arizona.\nIt looks like Solomon will play for the Wildcats.\nOregon State coach Gary Andersen says he assumed all along that Solomon would play.\nThe OSU defense braces for Solomon.\nThe O's five things to watch in the Arizona-Oregon game.\nWatch: Beavers QB Seth Collins 'excited' for Oregon State-Arizona Beavers quarterback Seth Collins talks about Oregon State's matchup against Arizona Saturday.\nArizona's defense looks to bounce back from two shaky weeks.\nArizona tackle Layth Friekh's biggest fan watches from halfway around the world.\nPortland State can't afford to pass on the air game.\nSome quick facts about Portland State's game with North Texas.\nSwitch to offense pays off for North Texas tackle Micah Thompson.\nKyle Bonagura of ESPN.com: Sarkisian had no answers.\nWashington uses some vintage Petersen trickery to stun USC.\nHuskies smother USC to give Petersen a signature victory.\nThe Trojans get booed off the field after a second consecutive home loss.\nUSC hits bottom with the loss to the Huskies.\nTrojans inability to convert on third down is costly.\nFive tough lessons for USC.\nTargeting penalty means UW linebacker Azeem Victor must sit out the first half of next week's game against Oregon.\nSark takes the blame for USC's loss.\nUSC center Max Tuerk suffers a sprained knee against Washington, is questionable for the Trojans' game against Notre Dame.\nESPN.com Pac-12 guru Ted Miller: Utah wants more than to be college's football flavor of the month.\nGordon Monson of the Salt Lake Tribune: Utah can't let up now.\nCal safety Stefan McClure stands tall off the field.\nKyle Kragen emerges as Cal's best pass rusher.\nCal coach Sonny Dykes is unconcerned about the Salt Lake City elevation.\nASU coach Todd Graham says if Colorado had held onto the ball, the Buffaloes could have beaten Oregon.\nTracking the production of Arizona State receiver D.J.
