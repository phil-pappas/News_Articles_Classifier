(Photo: Mike Ehrmann, Getty Images) 1224 CONNECT 140 TWEET LINKEDIN 36 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLouisville basketball coach Rick Pitino said Thursday he \"will not resign and let you down\" in a lengthy blog post on his personal website. \nThe post comes in the wake of U of L president James Ramsey saying he has not discussed resigning with Pitino , a Hall of Fame coach who led the Cardinals to the 2013 national title. Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich on Tuesday also vouched for Pitino , saying the coach had a long-term contract with the university and had no plans to step down. \nU of L, the NCAA and local authorities are investigating allegations in a recent book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules,\" in which escort Katina Powell claims a former Louisville staffer paid her and other escorts, including her own teenage daughters, thousands of dollars and gave them game tickets in exchange for dancing for and having sex with players and recruits. \nThe former staffer, Andre McGee, has acknowledged through his lawyer, Scott C. Cox, that he knows Powell but also denied paying anyone for sex. Pitino, in multiple comments over the past few weeks, has said if any of the alleged activities were going on, he did not know about them. \n\"I'm sorry we all have to endure the pain of these allegations,\" Pitino wrote to begin his post. \"I so appreciate your support and friendships. \n\"I will not resign and let you down. Someday I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years, but that time is not now. I do not fight these accusations by others, but rather turn the other cheek. Couldn't do it at 33, but at 63, it's the wise thing to do. Let's let the investigators do their job and we will play basketball.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:30:54.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
