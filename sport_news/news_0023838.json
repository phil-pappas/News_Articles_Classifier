Photo Sarah Reed.\nWARREN PARTLAND The Advertiser Former world triathlon champion Emma Carney feels like she is racing against her own life when she lines up in competitions.\nIn her words, it’s a very odd situation. Carney’s heart rate cannot go over 160 beats per minute or she puts her life at risk. It is that serious.\nIn 2004, Carney’s world crashed around her when she suffered a cardiac arrest. A dual world triathlon champion and three-times World Cup winner, Carney almost lost her life.\nHer career was over after being told she would never be able to exercise again.\n“I did not do triathlons because I was good at them, I loved the lifestyle,’’ said Carney, who is in Adelaide for the ITU Duathlon World Championship. The elite races will be contested at Elder Park tomorrow with the age races tomorrow. Carney will contest the 40-44 age group.\n“I could not work out what was going wrong in the last few years of my career and I missed the (2000) Sydney (Olympic) Games. Then I had the cardiac arrest in 2004.\n“It has taken me 10 years to get back to a level of fitness where I can feel confident to be involved in a competition situation and it is frightening.\n“I have got to keep my heart rate below 160 so I have to race without going flat out. It is very frustrating but it’s better than the first diagnosis. It is not about winning anymore.\n“I’ve managed to survive a cardiac arrest so I’m lucky to be here. Hopefully I can get some awareness out there about heart conditions and looking after yourself.’’\nCarney won the age division of the Noosa triathlon in 2012. Her cardiologist was horrified she even competed.\nHer goal is to contest another triathlon although she understands the duathlon, comprising running and cycling, is a much safer option. A cardiac arrest in the water would most likely be fatal.\nThe mother of five-year old Jack, Carney coaches school age kids and has her own website — emmacarney.com — offering training programs.\nLast year’s world duathlon champion, Frenchman Benoit Nicolas, heads the talent-laden entries for tomorrow’s elite race with the field including Belgium star Rob Woestenborghs.\nFrance’s Sandra Levenez is favourite to capture the women’s event with her main opposition being Australians Gillian Backhouse and Felicity Sheedy-Ryan.\nThe races involve a 10km run followed by a 40km cycle and 5km run.\n Meet the elite athlete who can’t try too hard", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ab6240445419ce8b1021aa9b3926b5ba", "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/more-sports/emma-carney-battles-heart-condition-as-well-as-opponents/story-fnii0hmp-1227572067857", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:29:23.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
