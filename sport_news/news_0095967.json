The de Blasio administration and City Councilman Corey Johnson Thursday announced a plan to transform a dingy three-block stretch in the West Village into a five building housing complex — and generate $100 million for rundown Pier 40.\nThe deal, which must be approved by the Hudson River Park Trust and the City Council, allows the aging and badly damaged pier to transfer its development rights to the other site, which is located across the West Side Highway.\nThat site, currently known as St. John’s Center, covers more than three city blocks from Charlton to Clarkson Streets near the West Side Highway.\nThe developers will turn that site into a 1,587 unit complex with five buildings.\nThe tallest of those buildings will be 40 stories high.\nThe group, known as St. John’s Partners and which includes Westbrook Partners and Atlas Capital Group LLC, has promised that nearly 500 of the housing units at the new complex will be affordable, with an emphasis on senior housing.\nnyc.gov The transaction, which will undergo a full public review process, would generate about $100 million to repair Pier 40 by transferring development rights to the nearby St. John’s site, located across the West Side Highway from Pier 40.
