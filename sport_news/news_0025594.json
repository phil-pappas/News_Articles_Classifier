Bowl outlook: Breaking down the postseason chances for N.C.'s Division I teams By Sammy Batten - Staff writer \nA little more than half the college football regular season is still to be played, so it may seem a bit premature to be discussing postseason bowl possibilities. \nBut with six of North Carolina’s seven Football Bowl Subdivision teams already halfway to meeting the NCAA-required six wins for bowl eligibility it’s a topic worth examining. \nDuke needs just one more victory. Appalachian State, N.C. State and North Carolina need a pair of wins, and East Carolina and Wake Forest need three to qualify for postseason play. Charlotte is completing a transition process to the FBS level and won’t be eligible for postseason play until 2016. \nThe Mountaineers could secure their first bowl bid since making the move from the Football Championship Subdivision to the FBS, while the Demon Deacons are hoping to end a three-year post-season drought. \nWhile the bowl picture tends to change from weekend to the next, here’s our outlook on each team’s stars and stats to date, big games remaining, national bowl projections and our prediction on how each will finish. APPALACHIAN STATE \nRecord: 4-1 overall, 1-0 Sun Belt Conference. \nThe schedule: Appalachian caught a break in its second-half scheduling by having home games against preseason favorite Georgia Southern as well as league powers Arkansas State and Louisiana-Lafayette. \nWhat makes it an attractive bowl team? The Mountaineers have an explosive, exciting offense with a star runner in Marcus Cox. They also play tough defense and have a rabid fan base that would be excited about attending the school’s first bowl game. \nNATIONAL BOWL PROJECTIONS \nThe Sporting News: AutoNation Cure Bowl (Dec. 19) vs. East Carolina \nCBSSports.com : GoDaddy.com Bowl (Dec. 23) vs. Northern Illinois \nSBNation: R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl (Dec. 19) vs. Louisiana Tech \nESPN’s Mark Schlabach: AutoNation Cure Bowl (Dec. 19) vs. Tulsa \nESPN’s Brett McMurphy: GoDaddy.com Bowl (Dec. 23) vs. Bowling Green \nOUR PROJECTION \nThe Mountaineers finish 10-2 overall, 7-1 in Sun Belt and earn the GoDaddy.com Bowl bid versus Mid-American Conference champ Toledo. DUKE \nRecord: 5-1 overall, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference. \nThe schedule: Where the Blue Devils finish in the ACC’s Coastal Division will be determined by a three-game stretch against Miami at home (Oct. 31), at rival North Carolina (Nov. 7) and at home against Pitt (Nov. 14). \nWhat makes Duke an attractive bowl team? Duke’s re-emergence under David Cutcliffe has turned the Blue Devils into a team to watch for the astute fan. Plus, Duke features two of the nation’s most exciting players in safety Jeremy Cash and kick return specialist DeVon Edwards. \nNATIONAL BOWL PROJECTIONS \nThe Sporting News: TaxSlayer Bowl (Jan. 2) vs. Georgia \nCBSSports.com : New Era Pinstripe Bowl (Dec. 26) vs. Nebraska \nSBNation: Belk Bowl (Dec. 30) vs. Tennessee \nESPN’s Mark Schlabach: Belk Bowl (Dec. 30) vs. Tennessee \nESPN’s Brett McMurphy: Belk Bowl (Dec. 30) vs. Kentucky \nOUR PROJECTION \nThe Blue Devils finish 9-3 overall, 6-2 in the ACC and behind Pitt and UNC in the Coastal race. Like the ESPN guys above, the Belk Bowl in Charlotte against Tennessee would be an interesting matchup for Cutcliffe against his former team. EAST CAROLINA \nRecord: 3-3 overall, 1-1 American Athletic Conference. \nThe schedule: Four of ECU’s final six games — all AAC affairs — are at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium. where the Pirates have won 12 of their last 13 league contests. Those include the two most pivotal games against East Division leader Temple (Oct. 22) and preseason favorite Cincinnati (Nov. 28). \nWhat makes ECU an attractive bowl team? The fan base will follow the team anywhere, and that is often more important to bowls than won-loss records. As a team, the Pirates aren’t nearly as exciting on offense as they’ve been in the recent years, but their performances in beating Virginia Tech and playing BYU and Florida to the wire make for an impressive resume. \nNATIONAL BOWL PROJECTIONS \nThe Sporting News: AutoNation Cure Bowl (Dec. 19) vs. Appalachian State \nCBSSports.com : Hawaii Bowl (Dec. 24) vs. Indiana \nSBNation: Boca Raton Bowl (Dec. 22) vs. Northern Illinois \nESPN’s Mark Schlabach: Miami Beach Bowl (Dec. 21) vs. Western Kentucky \nESPN’s Brett McMurphy: Birmingham Bowl (Dec. 30) vs. Tennessee \nOUR PROJECTION \nThe Pirates win five of their final six games, finish 8-4 overall, 6-2 in the AAC and just behind Temple in the East Division. With Temple, Houston and Navy tying up the Birmingham, St. Petersburg and Military bowl bids, ECU’s options will be the Boca Raton Bowl against a Mid-American foe or the Miami Beach Bowl versus a Mountain West team. Either way, south Florida in December sounds like a good deal. N.C. STATE \nRecord: 4-2 overall, 0-2 ACC \nThe schedule: The 0-2 start in league play has put the Wolfpack behind the 8-ball already. With ACC games remaining against nationally ranked Clemson (Oct. 31 at home) and at Florida State (Nov. 14), four conference losses seem a certainty. \nWhat makes State an attractive bowl team? It’s repetitive, but schools with rabid fan bases are coveted by bowl officials, especially those games outside the playoff selection committee’s control. The Wolfpack has a tremendous following that doesn’t mind traveling during the holidays. Another plus is senior quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who proved his postseason mettle in last year’s Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl win. \nNATIONAL BOWL PROJECTIONS \nThe Sporting News: Camping World Independence Bowl (Dec. 26) vs. Arkansas \nCBSSports.com : Military Bowl (Dec. 28) vs. Navy \nSBNation: Hyundai Sun Bowl (Dec. 26) vs. California \nESPN’s Mark Schlabach: Quick Lane Bowl (Dec. 28) vs. Illinois \nESPN’s Brett McMurphy: Camping World Independence Bowl (Dec. 26) vs. Auburn \nOUR PROJECTION \nI’m still a little confused by the Wolfpack. I keep thinking State should be better than its start in ACC play indicates. But until it proves it on the field, my best guess is a split of their final six games to finish 7-5 overall and 3-5 in ACC play. It’s not a great location, but a bid to the Camping World Independence Bowl would provide a nice matchup against an SEC foe such as Auburn. NORTH CAROLINA \nRecord: 4-1 overall, 1-0 ACC \nThe schedule: Beating nemesis Georgia Tech on the road kick-started the belief UNC can contend for the Coastal Division title. The real test of legitimacy for the Tar Heels will be a three-game stretch at Pittsburgh (Oct. 29), at home versus Duke (Nov. 7) and a Nov. 14 game at Miami. Win all three and the Coastal crown belongs to UNC. \nWhat makes North Carolina an attractive bowl team? Offense, offense, offense. Bowls like high-scoring teams with explosive athletes such as quarterback Marquise Williams and receiver-punt returner Ryan Switzer. UNC fans don’t always show up en masse for home games, but they will travel to a fun bowl destination. \nNational bowl projections \nThe Sporting News: Belk Bowl (Dec. 30) vs. Auburn \nCBSSports.com : TaxSlayer Bowl (Jan. 2) vs. Mississippi State \nSBNation: Russell Athletic Bowl (Dec. 29) vs. Oklahoma State \nESPN’s Mark Schlabach: Hyundai Sun Bowl (Dec. 26) vs. Arizona \nESPN’s Brett McMurphy: Hyundai Sun Bowl (Dec. 26) vs. Arizona State \nOur projection \nBecause the Coastal is so wide open, UNC could conceivably take the title. I see that honor going to Pitt and the Tar Heels coming in a close second with a 9-3 overall mark and 6-2 league ledger. That would earn UNC one of the ACC’s top-tier bowls. We like the Tar Heels in the TaxSlayer Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida, where the school has a lot of postseason history, just not of late. WAKE FOREST \nRecord: 3-3 overall, 1-2 \nThe schedule: The Deacons drew the wrong end of the stretch-run scheduling stick. They face rivals UNC and N.C. State the next two weeks, but it’s a finishing run in November against Notre Dame, Clemson and Duke that is likely to kill Wake’s postseason hopes. \nWhat makes Wake Forest an attractive bowl team? The Deacons would be a neat comeback/feel-good story by earning a bowl bid in Dave Clawson’s second year as head coach. Wake also has a stellar defense headed by linebacker Brandon Chubb. And if the Deacs somehow do become bowl eligible, it’ll be because they’ve beaten an arch rival or nationally ranked team along the way. \nOur projection \nOK, it was wishful thinking to include the Deacons as a potential postseason team. The schedule from here on out is just too difficult and I’m not sure there’s one left Wake Forest can win with its meager offense. Finishing 3-9 overall and 1-8 in ACC play is not the kind of second season Dave Clawson had in mind for the Deacs, but they are better and that’s where they’ll have to get their satisfaction for now. \nStaff writer Sammy Batten can be reached at battens@fayobserver or 486-3534.
