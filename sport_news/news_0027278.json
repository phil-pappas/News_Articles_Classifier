Championship Series opener. \n\"I wanted this game bad,\" Harvey said. \nAfter eliminating rival St. Louis and streaking into New York with 12 wins in 13 games, the power-hitting Cubs and their young sluggers were stopped cold on a chilly night at Citi Field. \n\"If Harvey wasn't pitching, it would have looked a lot better. He was outstanding tonight,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \"His stuff is always good, but the command was outrageous tonight.\" \nHarvey pitched into the eighth for the first time in more than two months, brushing aside all that hoopla last month about his innings limit. \n\"I talk to this guy every day. I know exactly what he's made of,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"He wants the baseball.\" \nJeurys Familia got four outs for his third playoff save and New York jumped ahead in its first NLCS since 2006 by beating the Cubs for the first time all year. The Mets went 0-7 during the season series and had dropped nine in a row to Chicago overall. \nMurphy connected off losing pitcher Jon Lester for his fourth homer of the playoffs and made a diving play at second base for the final out. Advertisement \nMurphy finished off the Dodgers in the deciding game of their Division Series with an all-around offensive performance that inspired a \"Mr. October\" nod in a tweet from the New York original, Reggie Jackson. Two nights later, the free-agent-to-be was at it again, launching another home run into the second deck in right field for his fourth of the postseason. \n\"Saving the homers,\" joked Murphy, who hit a career-high 14 during the regular season. \"If I knew what I was doing I would have hit more homers during the regular season.\" \nGame 2 is Sunday night, with Cubs ace Jake Arrieta facing rookie Noah Syndergaard. ALCS: Ben Zobrist's easy fly that somehow fell in for a hit began a five-run rally against David Price in the seventh inning, and the Kansas City Royals rolled to a 6-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday for a 2-0 lead in the A.L. Championship Series. The Royals had been held to one hit by Price before stringing together four singles and a double in their go-ahead inning. They got run-producing hits from Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Alex Gordon and Alex Rios, along with an RBI groundout from Kendrys Morales. \n\"Our guys never quit,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"They keep going.\" \nIt was a monumental collapse for Price, who had at one point recorded 18 straight outs. He fell to 0-7 in seven postseason starts, including a loss to Texas in their A.L. Division Series. \n\"I gave up hits at the wrong time,\" he said. \"I felt good. It's a very scrappy team. They put the ball in play. They continued to battle. It's just a tough loss.\" \nMeanwhile, the reigning A.L. champs have won nine straight ALCS games dating to their memorable seven-game series against Toronto in 1985 -- the year they won their only World Series. Now, the Blue Jays head home for Game 3 on Monday night in dire trouble. All but three of the previous 25 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven era have won the series -- though Toronto did rally from the same hole to beat the Rangers in five games in the divisional round. \n\"We've been here before,\" shortstop Troy Tulowitzki said, \"but it's not a place we want to be.\" Dodgers: With no urgency remaining following Los Angeles' elimination from the postseason, Major League Baseball and the players' association postponed Chase Utley's appeal hearing. Utley was suspended for two games by MLB Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre for a takeout slide in Game 2 of the N.L. Division Series that broke a leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada. \nStan Conte, the Dodgers' head athletic trainer for nine years after a 15-year stint with the Giants, has resigned to pursue research in baseball injuries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:37:33.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
