Dez Bryant will reportedly test out his injured foot this week to determine if he is able to play against the New York Giants.\nAdChoices During his weekly appearance on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones sounded optimistic about Bryant being close to making a return.\nJerry Jones says on @1053thefan that Dez has a chance to play this week. They will see if he's comfortable making his cuts Wed and Thurs.\n— Charean Williams (@NFLCharean) October 20, 2015\nJones added that if Bryant feels comfortable planting his foot and making cuts, he will play. If not, Jones made it seem like Bryant will almost certainly be back the following week.\nBryant returned to the practice field last week for on-field rehab, and he has been eyeing the Giants game as a potential first game back. While some initial reports predicted he would miss up to 12 weeks , Bryant has only missed six so far. He never expected to be out three months, which was obvious when he sent this tweet after getting hurt .\nFormer NFL team doctor David J. Chao notes that Bryant’s injury typically takes 6-8 weeks to heal, but the issue is more about whether he will be effective and up to speed than if he will be experiencing pain. As we know, Bryant at less than 100 percent is more than capable of helping out his struggling team.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/NFLCharean/status/656463847738314752", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/hONdiBm379P?data-mcuid=7d00c4a52b&data-mccampaign=47e0dc6a3a", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/dez-bryant-refutes-foot-injury-report/274710", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/dez-bryant-expected-to-be-out-10-12-weeks/274660", "https://twitter.com/1053thefan", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/ProFootballDoc/status/656471892983873536"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:37:31.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
