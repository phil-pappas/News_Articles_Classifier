It is reported that pesticides supplied by the firm failed to check the spread of whitefly that ruined the cotton crop on large tracts in the Malwa region. Both are said to be aides of Agriculture Director Mangal Singh Sandhu, who was arrested last night. The accused were nabbed following a raid in Fatehgarh village last night. Sources said the raid was carried out at the same time when the Bathinda police searched Sandhuâ€™s Chandigarh residence to arrest him. The sources said the police had been keeping a watch on the duo after their name cropped up during a probe in the pesticide scam. They were produced in a local court that sent them to police remand. Commissioner of Police Paramraj Singh Umranangal and Deputy Commissioner of Police Narinder Bhargav maintained that the links of Sher Singh and Subash Sharma with Sandhu were being investigated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:03:05.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
