Carey Callahan had nine digs, Maggie Tensen had eight digs, Paige Skrim had two kills and three blocks, and Hailey Paddock had one kill and three blocks. \nStaples (10-6) had 10 kills, two digs and one block from Ginny Gerig, while Reece Schachne had eight kills, and Maya Lawande had 20 assists and three digs. \nThe Rams’ last victory was a 3-1 decision against the Norwalk Bears on Oct. 7 in Norwalk.
