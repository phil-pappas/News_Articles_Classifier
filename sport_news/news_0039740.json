Burton quickly set about the task of hauling themselves level, Calum Butcher's low curling effort seriously testing Chris Maxwell's reactions early after the break. But the hosts looked smart on the break and extended their lead before the hour. Jimmy Ryan picked out Proctor's run on the right, Grant receiving the ball just inside the box and slotting low across McLaughlin with the ball creeping in the far corner. Grant and Proctor were not done, combining again for Fleetwood's third. Proctor's pressure on the Brewers' defence released the ball and Grant broke free before curling his shot into the top corner from just inside the box. Two subs combined for the fourth, with Jamille Matt breaking down the right, his first touch taking him into the box, and then selfishly squaring for Ash Hunter to slide the ball in at the second attempt after his initial shot was blocked on the line.
