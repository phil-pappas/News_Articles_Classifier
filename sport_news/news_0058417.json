(AP Photo/Rich Schultz) \nNEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Pekka Rinne made 22 saves and the Nashville Predators ran their season-opening winning streak to three with a 3-1 victory over the struggling New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night. \nRoman Josi had a power-play goal in the first period and added a short-handed empty netter in the third. Eric Nystrom also had an empty-net goal for the Predators, off to their best start since 2010-11. \nRinne has played a major role in that success, allowing only two goals so far. \nAnd he set another club milestone. Rinne has played 384 games, most by a Nashville goalie. Tomas Vokoun held the old mark. Rinne also owns the club records for wins (207) and shutouts (37). \nRinne lost his shutout when Kyle Palmieri scored on a power play with 1:40 left. \nNew Jersey has lost all three if its games, leaving the tandem of general manager Ray Shero and coach John Hynes looking for their first wins since taking over in the off season. Keith Kinkaid stopped 17 shots in his second straight start for the Devils. Cory Schneider missed the game for birth of his son early Tuesday morning. \nThe Predators had the only power play of the opening period, and Josi cashed in for his first of the season. \nShea Weber was the catalyst from the left point. After unloading a slapper that Kinkaid blocked, Weber spotted Josi in the right circle and faked another shot before feeding the puck to the wide-open winger for a one-timer at 10:34. \nThe Devils pressed for the equalizer early in the second and came close when Jordin Tootoo hit the crossbar. \nNew Jersey had the first five shots of the period but could not dent Rinne before the Predators reverted to their usual stifling defensive style and allowed the Devils only one more before the second intermission. \nThings opened up at the end when Nashville’s Cody Hodgson was whistled for holding with 2:58 remaining. \nKinkaid left for an extra attacker and Josi hit the empty net for a 2-0 lead with Rinne assisting at 17:21. \nKinkaid was still on the bench when Nystrom closed out the scoring with 51.5 seconds left. \nNOTES: The Predators play the Islanders on Thursday and the Senators on Saturday to conclude their first trip … Devils D John Moore was scratched with a bruised right arm The Devils also sat out C Sergey Kalinin. … The Nashville scratches were defensemen Anthony Biletto, Victor Bartley and LW Viktor Arvidsson. … Predators C Mike Ribeiro played in his 950th game. … The Devils called up Yann Danis to back up Kinkaid. New Jersey cleared roster space by assigning F Reid Boucher to Albany of the AHL.
