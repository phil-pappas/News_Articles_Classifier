Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports Imagine the outrage if an NFL team hired a head coach that had no previous experience coaching.\nAdChoices Imagine the national uproar if the next president of the United States had no previous experience as an elected official.\nNow let's assume we live in a country where Donald Trump won't succeed Barack Obama as the next Commander-in-chief, and turn our attention to a job with a worse retention rate than an entry level position at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.\n\"They have an excellent corporate structure, and they give you the tools to be your own boss,\" says Will Ferrell's character in the movie Step Brothers , while contemplating a job at Enterprise as his next career move.\nThe Seattle Mariners, of course, do not have an excellent corporate structure, as evidenced by the MLB's longest postseason drought and years of managerial turnover under CEO Howard Lincoln.\nThe Mariners announced Scott Servais as their new manager Friday afternoon to replace Lloyd McClendon, who was fired after two seasons despite a winning record overall.\nServais, 48, has never coached or managed in the big leagues or minor leagues. After an an 11-year MLB career, he's been a roving catching instructor for the Cubs, a scout for the Rockies, a farm director for the Rangers and an assistant general manager for the Angels.\nAt first glance, it might seem odd for general manager Jerry Dipoto to hire an old teammate with no coaching experience to manage a veteran clubhouse.\nThe reality: Hiring managers with no previous experience managing has become commonplace throughout MLB.\n\"The best marriages are those in which you fall in love and then get married, rather than someone arranging it from 1,000 miles away,\" Dipoto said at his introductory press conference.\nServais certainly fits that description, having been Dipoto's teammate with the Rockies in 2000, working together again for Colorado in 2005, and with the Angels for four seasons.\nWhether he's qualified remains to be seen.\nConsider this list of managers with no previous managing or coaching experience, before rushing to judge the Servais hire.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals hired Mike Matheny to replace Tony LaRussa, and he's led them to four consecutive playoff experiences, including the 2013 World Series, since taking over in 2012.\nThe Chicago White Sox brought in Robin Ventura in 2012, and he's had less success while compiling a 297-351 record over four seasons without a playoff appearance.\nColorado Rockies manager Walt Weiss has been in charge for three seasons. He's yet to post a winning record.\nCraig Counsell took over the Arizona Diamondbacks this season after Kirk Gibson was fired and compiled a 61-76 record. Kevin Cash led an overachieving Tampa Bay Rays team to an 80-82 mark in his first season as manager in 2015, though he was previously the bullpen coach for the Cleveland Indians for two seasons.\nAnd oddly enough, Marlins general manager Dan Jennings became the club's manager this year after firing Mike Redmond, then decided he would return to his previous front-office role after going 55-69. In Detroit, Brad Ausmus was hired over Lloyd McClendon to manage the Tigers after Jim Leyland opted to retire.\nHe won 90 games in 2014 before a disappointing 74-87 record this season.\nOf that group, Matheny has enjoyed the most success, though one must take into account that he manages for one of the most, efficient well-run organizations in all of sports.\nSo if you're skeptical of the Scott Servais hire, that's OK.
