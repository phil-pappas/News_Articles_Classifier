The sixth-graders had something to prove over the weekend. After losing a tough game to Bayfield in Week 6, the Demons put in some hard work on the practice field. The work paid off, as Durango took last week’s frustration out on Aztec and cruised to a 28-7 victory. Cole Matava scored on the team’s opening drive, and it was all Demons from that moment forward. Emmet Thompson ran wild on Aztec. He ran the ball 26 times for 198 yards and a touchdown. Nate Messier added two more touchdowns. The Demons’ defense also took care of business behind interceptions from Matt Pane, Jordan Stanley and Thompson. Ashton Harrison and Messier recovered fumbles in the rout. The sixth-graders will try to keep the momentum going at 11 a.m. this week at home against Farmington. The fifth-grade Demons team is on fire and got out to a fast start in a 27-13 win against the Farmington Panthers. Beau Brunson took the opening kickoff to the house and added a 30-yard touchdown run on the next drive to give Durango a quick 14-0 lead. Jeric Baruch’s five-yard touchdown run put the Demons up 21-0, and the opponents could never recover from the early onslaught. The fifth-graders are now 6-1 with six consecutive wins and will try to do the same to the Farmington Oilers at 9 a.m. Saturday at home. The third-graders came out on the winning end of a Week 7 shootout, beating Cortez 32-20. Braxton Waddell rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown, while Malakai Baker added 43 yards on the ground and a touchdown. Quarterback Linkin Griego had 90 yards of total offense, a rushing touchdown and a passing touchdown. The third-graders are also 6-1 and will take on Bloomfield in the regular season finale at 1 p.m. Saturday in Durango. Coming off of Tres Esquibel’s monster game in Week 6, the second-graders suffered a tough 13-6 loss to the Farmington Panthers. Esquibel and Lance Baker led the charge in the loss. The second-graders will try to finish the season on a high note at 3 p.m. Saturday at home against Bayfield. The fourth-graders put forth a solid effort but came up on the short end of a 25-12 matchup with Cortez. Brett Hamer hammered through the opposing defense by rushing for 123 yards and a touchdown. Zac Unruh added a rushing touchdown of his own, and Clay Braida was a force on defense with 8 tackles. The fourth-graders will close out the regular season against the Farmington Sting at 9 a.m. Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:59:30.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
