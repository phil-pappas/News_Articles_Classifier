They joined local volunteers in making a difference at Taft Elementary School. They say, \"Build it and they will come.\" The kids at Taft Elementary will be charging onto an all new playground. The new playground was pretty much built in a day thanks to some big-hearted Bengals players and very generous volunteers. It may have been there day off from football, but the Bengals players and an army of volunteers had a game plan, to give Taft Elementary school a real playground.Barbara Dundee of the Marvin Lewis Community Fund said, \"When we found out that this school didn’t have an outside playground so kids could go out to have a recess we decided we needed to do something about that.\"\"It's crazy to think of an elementary school without that and so to be able to provide with a chance for these kids to have a chance to play its going to be great,\" said Andy Dalton, Bengals quarterback.So Dalton and his teammates rolled up their sleeves and went to work. There was Dalton and Domata Peko teaming up with volunteers to piece together a play set.Peko looked like a natural on the construction site, “I like to get in and get my hands dirty. I’m more of a blue collar hard worker type of guy and I’m going to dig in here and build this playground and help out.\"While there was a lot of activity at the center of the playground, there was other work going on elsewhere. Michael Johnson and Emmanuel Lamur were tending to the flower beds. Reggie Nelson and a team of volunteers painted chairs.Nelson said, \"It's always great to give back to the community and do somethind for the kids and paint and interact with the companies that help us do it.\"And there was Tyler Eifert manning the wheelbarrow, helping the landscaping crew, “It's always good to do something that really makes a difference in somebody’s life. We play football for a living and give people something to cheer about but to actually do something that makes a difference, it feels really good to be out here.\"The players also laid bricks, with their names on them, to form the shape of a football. People who live in the neighborhood stood nearby, looking on with appreciation, as their football heroes built their kids a playground.Principal Dr. Jonathon Brown said, “They're looking forward to this day because we’ve been telling them about this for the past few months since school started. Our parents are excited, our teachers are excited, we’re simply thrilled.\"An impressive turnout of Bengals Tuesday; 51 players signed up to take part in the project. Their work looked pretty good! The Bengals, the United Way and the Marvin Lewis Community Fund teamed up for the project to help promote volunteerism. In addition to the Bengals and the volunteers, a number of local companies contributed equipment and manpower. \n\nFollow Larry Davis on Twitter @larrydaviswkrc , and LIKE him on Facebook .
