Since then, the Wildcats have won three straight. \nThe Wildcats scored points on their first five possessions. They opened the first quarter on a 20-0 run and went into halftime with a 30-0 lead.Powers opened the game with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Johnson. \nCy Woods linebacker Brandon DePrato picked off a pass on the next drive and two plays later it was Powers to Johnson again for a 39-yard score. \nThe Wildcats then forced Cy-Fair to punt. And it was CJ Jones' turn to take over. He rushed for 27, 14 and 33 yards on three consecutive plays to help set up Powers' 1-yard touchdown run with a missed PAT. \n\"We just went back to last year,\" said Jones, who had 180 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries.\"We were fast-paced. At the beginning of the year, we slowed down. But we got back to our ways of being fast and working as a team and everybody playing their part.\" \nCy Woods didn't ease up, either. The Wildcats added Luis Reyes'32-yard field goal and Powers' 4-yard touchdown run before half. \nCy-Fair's offense was stagnant. \nIn its first five possessions, Cy-Fair (5-3, 5-2) punted four times and threw and interception.The Bobcats had 68 total yards of offense at the half and finished with 202. \nCy-Fair did have its best drive of the night to open the third quarter. It was an eight-play, 75-yard drive that ended in Hayden Wesneski's 38-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brock Wright. \nEnough damage had been done, though, evident by Jones' lone touchdown run on the next drive - a 2-yard score. \nCy-Fair lost a fumble on its next drive recovered by Cy Woods' Myles Wilson. Tipping the turnover margin in its favor has been key to Cy Woods' run. \n\"There's one big stat that stood out besides the score of course,\" Cy Woods head coach Trent Faith said. \"It was the turnover battle. We were losing the turnover battle. When we started winning the turnover battle, we started winning ball games.\" \nAt 4-3 in district play, Cy Woods is still chasing Cy Ranch, Cy Falls and Cy Creek. Thursday's win puts the Wildcats just a game behind Cy-Fair with two to play.You won't catch Faith watching the standings, though. \n\"The coaches are doing it because that's just what we do a little bit,\" Faith said. But I'm not worried about it. We're preaching to our guys 1-0 each week. We kind of dug ourselves in a hole but we can't worry about that. We can only try to take care of our business.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:52:44.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
