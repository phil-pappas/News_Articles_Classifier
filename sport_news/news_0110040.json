They are currently being employed by Coastguard, military, customs, Police and patrol and rescue fleets in markets as diverse as the United States, Europe, Asia, Scandinavia and throughout the South Pacific.\nRayglass Protectors are also very popular as fast, luxurious tenders to multi-million dollar superyachts, as private pleasure craft and as support boats for major yachting campaigns (such as the America’s Cup where they have been chosen by holders Oracle USA and leading challengers Emirates Team New Zealand, Artemis and Softbank Japan).\nProtector RIBs are also popular in the oil exploration industry, as first responder vessels and in a wide variety of commercial applications.\nBased on the water’s edge in the Auckland, New Zealand, suburb of Mt Wellington, Rayglass employs over 60 people in three state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and is one of New Zealand’s most successful marine businesses, both at home and internationally.\nIn addition to the internationally-respected Protector range of patrol, work and pleasure RIBs and the multi-award winning Legend series of 6-12 metre GRP powerboats, the company also manufactures and exports the highly innovative Pro-Jet (the world’s first commercially-manufactured PWC-powered RIB).\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13030340.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13030340.htm"], "published": "2015-10-20T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:53:23.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
