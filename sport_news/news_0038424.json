The price for violating Erin Andrews’ privacy is steep.\nAndrews, the ESPN-turned-Fox Sports personality, is seeking $75 million in damages after she was secretly videotaped while nude during stays in three hotels in 2008.\nIn documents filed in Nashville and obtained by The Smoking Gun , Andrews alleges that Matiott employees played a role in stalker Michael David Barrett’s voyeurism by confirming that she was staying at the hotel and telling Barrett what room the then-30-year-old was staying in. Barrett videotaped Andrews, who also hosts ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars,” through the peephole on the door of her room and uploaded videos of her in various states of undress to a website.\nCharles Rex Arbogast/AP Michael David Barrett gets sentenced to 30 months in prison for secretly videotaping Erin Andrews. Barrett was sentenced to 30 months in prison after pleading guilty to felony stalking charges in 2009. He was also forced to register as a sex offender.\nThe case, which lists Mariott, West End Hotel Partners, Windsor Capital Group and Barrett as defendants , is set to go to trial in February. Andrews filed a similar lawsuit in Chicago in 2010.", "external_links": ["http://thesmokinggun.com/file/erin-andrews-75m", "http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/erin-andrews-seeks-75-million-751098"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:51:44.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
