It’s not a fond memory. The Silver Streaks endured a controversial call at the net late in the match and fell to Monmouth-Roseville 18-25, 25-23, 30-28 in regional semifinal action at John Thiel Gymnasium. Clay, who is in her 22nd season, wants to see her team travel uncharted waters. The Streaks haven't won a regional crown since 2007. Galesburg’s roster lists four sophomores, eight juniors and two seniors, so staying consistent has been a challenge. The Streaks are riding a five-game winning streak heading into the Class 3A Peoria Notre Dame Regional. Peoria High School will play Canton today at 6 p.m. in the opener followed by Richwoods vs. Manual at 7 p.m. Galesburg (19-12) will face the winner at 6 p.m. Tuesday. The Streaks notched wins against both the Little Giants and Lions in the regular season. “We are playing really well. I feel like some of the things that were weaknesses we worked hard to correct,” Clay said. “I really feel good about my team right now. I don’t feel like they ever shut down. They keep playing. They are very competitive and don’t like to lose. I have a lot of faith in them. “I would love to win the regional. If we play well, we should do well. I’m excited to get going.” Unlike Clay, Knoxville coach Marci Tyrrell, who is in her first season, doesn’t know anything about her team’s first postseason opponent. The Blue Bullets (13-12) will face Sherrard at 7 p.m. Tuesday in Match 3 of the Class 2A United Regional. “We have not even seen them and I’m completely OK with that,” Tyrrell said. “Sometimes I think girls have a preconceived notions of what to expect based on records and things and now we can just go focus on our game. “Our biggest struggle is we are a very young team. Two of them (Shelby Shreeves and Lauren Kavanagh) were on the eighth-grade team last year and are now on the varsity level. That’s a big task for them.” Rallying while down has been a challenge for Knoxville. “When we get a run on us, we shut down communication-wise and we’ve been working on maintaining the consistency,” Tyrrell said. Abingdon-Avon (6-19-1) faces West Central at 6 p.m. today in the opening match of the United Regional. “We are playing the best ball we have right now,” A-Town coach Cindy Paulus said. “The ball is in their court. If they play like we know they can play then we can do great things. We’ve been right there in matches with really good teams. We just lack consistency. Page 2 of 3 - “We are just going to do it one game at a time but I will tell any team that if they look by us they are making a mistake. If we get our heads on straight, we should have a good regional showing.” ROWVA coach Tricia Bledsoe, who is in her second season, hopes the same for her team. “We have struggled with confidence and rhythm in the second half of our season but found it (last) Thursday night in our match against Ridgewood (3-21),” Bledsoe said. ROWVA (7-19) plays Williamsfield (7-16) at 6 p.m. tonight in Match 1 in Class 1A regional action at Kewanee Wethersfield. “Anyone can win on any given night; it’s the postseason,” Tyrrell said. “It depends on who brings their game; and just because you beat a team before that doesn't mean anything, you can easily lose to them.\" REGIONAL VOLLEYBALL Class 3A Peoria Notre Dame Regional Monday, Oct. 26Match 1 — (9) Peoria vs. (10) Canton, 6 p.m.Match 2 — (7) Peoria (Richwoods) vs. (11) Peoria Manual, 7 p.m.Tuesday , Oct. 27Match 3 — (2) Galesburg vs. Winner Match 1, 6 p.m.Match 4 — (3) Peoria (Notre Dame) vs. Winner Match 2, 7 p.m.Thursday , Oct. 29Match 5 — Winner Match 3 vs. Winner Match 4, 6 p.m. Class 3A Illinois Valley Central Regional Monday, Oct. 26Match 1 — (6) Monmouth-Roseville vs. (8) Illinois Valley Central, 6 p.m.Tuesday , Oct. 27Match 2 — (1) Limestone vs. Winner Match 1, 6 p.m.Match 3 — (4) Dunlap vs. (5) Macomb, 7 p.m.Thursday , Oct. 29Match 4 — Winner Match 2 vs. Winner Match 3, 6 p.m. Class 2A United Regional Monday, Oct. 26Match 1 — (8) Abingdon-Avon vs. (9) West Central, 6 p.m.Tuesday , Oct. 27Match 2 — (2) United vs. Winner Match 1, 6 p.m.Match 3 — (3) Sherrard vs. (6) Knoxville, 7 p.m.Thursday , Oct. 29Match 4 — Winner Match 2 vs. Winner Match 3, 6 p.m. Class 2A Mercer County Regional Monday, Oct. 26Match 1 — (7) Alleman vs. (10) Mercer County, 6 p.m.Match 2 — (5) Rockridge vs. (11)Ridgewood, 7 p.m.Tuesday , Oct. 27Match 3 — (1) Orion vs. Winner Match 1, 6 p.m.Match 4 — (4) North Fulton vs. Winner Match 2, 7 p.m.Thursday , Oct. 29Match 5 — Winner Match 3 vs. Winner Match 4, 6 p.m. Page 3 of 3 - Class 1A Wethersfield Regional Monday, Oct. 26Match 1 — (9) Williamsfield vs. (10) ROWVA, 6 p.m.Tuesday , Oct. 27Match 2 — (2) Wethersfield vs. Winner Match 1, 6 p.m.Match 3 — (3) LaMoille vs. (5) Annawan, 7 p.m.Thursday , Oct. 29Match 4 — Winner Match 2 vs. Winner Match 3, 6 p.m. Class 1A Midland Regional Monday, Oct. 26Match 1 — (7) Henry-Senachwine vs. (8) Midland, 6 p.m.Match 2 — (6) Lowpoint-Washburn vs. (11) DePue, 7 p.m.Tuesday , Oct. 27Match 3 — (1) Princeville vs. Winner Match 1, 6 p.m.Match 4 — (4) Galva vs. Winner Match 2, 7 p.m.Thursday , Oct. 29Match 5 — Winner Match 3 vs. Winner Match 4, 6 p.m. Class 1A Astoria Regional Monday, Oct. 26 Match 1 — (7) Triopia vs. (8) Bushnell-Prairie City, 6 p.m.Match 2 — (5) Lewistown vs. (10) Astoria, 7 p.m.Tuesday , Oct. 27Match 3 — (1) Southeastern vs. Winner Match 1, 6 p.m.Match 4 — (4) West Prairie vs. Winner Match 2, 7 p.m.Thursday , Oct. 29Match 5 — Winner Match 3 vs. Winner Match 4, 6 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:15:34.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
