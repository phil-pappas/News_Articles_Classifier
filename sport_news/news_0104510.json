(Kenneth K. Lam / Baltimore Sun) Edward Lee Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Without much fanfare, defense has set tone for Johns Hopkins football. \nWith an offense ranked 12th in Division III in scoring (46.7 points per game) and 19th in yards per game (503.0), the Johns Hopkins defense tends to get overshadowed. \nMaybe that shouldn’t be the case any longer. \nThe No. 10 Blue Jays (6-0 overall, 5-0 in the Centennial Conference) is tied for the 25th-fewest points allowed per contest in the country (14.5) and ranks 30th in third-down conversion rate allowed (29.3 percent). Within the league, the defense ranks second against the run (116.0 yards per game), interceptions (11) and opponents’ first downs (105). \nThose numbers could be lower if coach Jim Margraff did not pull starters in the second half of three contests this fall. \n“They’ve been outstanding, and a lot of the points scored against us have not been against our first defense,” Margraff said, referring to Hopkins opponents scoring 51 of their 87 points in the second half. “We have gotten a lot of guys time. I think almost every game though, the opposing offense has moved the ball early on us, and our defense has bent, but hasn’t broken. Then they make some adjustments, get used to things and they’ve been dominating in a lot of the games. Other than the Muhlenberg game, which was a normal game against a very, very good team, our defense has been outstanding.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:44:46.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
