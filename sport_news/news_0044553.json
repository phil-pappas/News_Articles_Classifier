He also lauded the Indian Super League (ISL) as a tournament which can lift the game in the country. “You have to start working at the base. You have to give chance to players to go abroad and play from where they can gather experience. They can then come here and share their experiences. But firstly you have to support the base,” Pele said at a media interaction here at Taj Bengal hotel. “You should have football in universities, schools and colleges. It is important to train kids for the future,” said the 74-year-old. The legend, who was little astonished to hear ISL lasts for only about three months, had no doubts that the league can improve Indian football. “Oh yes! ISL can improve Indian football, no doubt about it.” To a poser from Atletico de Kolkata co-owner Sanjiv Goenka as to what advice he would like to give to the local franchise, Pele replied: “I would tell them to respect opponents, and be prepared always. You also have to keep on learning.” In his opening address, Pele also fondly spoke about the love he has got from the city. “I have been received with a good heart. The love for me has not changed over 38 years. It was with the same love and respect that the people received me. That is most important for me. From all Brazilians and me I say, I love you, thank you very much.” The three-time World Cup winner’s made his maiden trip to Kolkata in 1977, and turned out for American side New York Cosmos against local giants Mohun Bagan at the Eden Gardens ground. The match ended 2-12. Former India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly also recollected that as a child he had seen the film “Giants of Brazil” featuring the travails and indomitaable spirit and the ultimate success of the Samba magicians. “When you were here last time, I was a four year-old kid,. So I don’t remember much and I have never seen you play live. But I have seen your videos and it was an unbelievable sight to watch somebody so skillful.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:44:56.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
