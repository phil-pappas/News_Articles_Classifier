Bulletin staff reports Tweet \nThe East Union High girls golf team put together a strong overall performance in the annual Sierra Invitational on Wednesday. \nIn doing so, they took second place in the tough field consisting defending Sac-Joaquin Section Masters Tournament champion Oak Ridge, which captured the 18-hole event held at the Manteca Park Golf Course. \nThe Lancers were edged out by Oak Ridge in the 19-team field, 409-427, but finished two strokes better than Rocklin (429), which won the Masters title two years ago. \nBrooke Riley, East Union’s No. 1 golfer, tied Beah Cruz of Christian Brothers for the top score. Both shot 70 to share medalist honors, but Cruz was declared the winner via tiebreaker (back-nine score). \n“Brooke finished strong, birdying three of the last four holes,” Lancers coach Brian Goulart said. \nHe was also thrilled with the efforts turned in by his No. 2 player Rebecca Leonard, who shot an 84 including a 40 on the front nine, and sophomore Natalie Cowan. She carded an 86 while shooting a 39 on the back nine. \nBrittany Conjin, East Union’s No. 5 player, also sizzled on the back nine, shooting a 40 and tallying an overall 92. Chloe Cardenas (95) and Allie Tajii (100) rounded out the scoring. \n“We need to be balanced like that for every match,” Goulart said. “Consistent scores is our goal from here on out.” \nHost Sierra posted a 537 – finishing ninth, in the process – and was led by McKenna Doyle, who shot a 95. \nManteca (589) was also part of the field, getting a 108 from No. 2 golfer Alyssa Gutierrez. \nThe Timberwolves were made up of Kayla Wilson (111), Legacy Barnes (109), Arlena Gavino (107), Bryanna Gavino (115) and Kaitlyn Looney (120). \nRounding out the scoring for the Buffaloes were Kylee Eberle (117), Haighley Kissee (119), Sierra Martinez (118), Breanna Pease (127) and Kate Botell (152). \nThe top 10 teams also included Heritage (469), El Capitan (471), Christian Brothers (473), Vacaville (474), Buhach Colony (492), and St. Mary’s (549). \nThe East Union Lancers won this event for the past seven years. Given the strength of the field, they’ll gladly take second place at least for now. \n\nOakdale 226, \nLathrop 310 \nFRENCH CAMP — Taylor Stewart led Oakdale with a 2-over 34 at French Camp Golf Course.
