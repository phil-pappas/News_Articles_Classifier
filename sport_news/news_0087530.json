Dynamo Kiev, Southampton, it's too much for him. I would probably be the same (if it happened to me).\"\nMourinho ranted about the referees turning down penalty claims after this week's 0-0 Champions League draw in Kiev and the 3-1 Premier League defeat by Southampton earlier this month.\nBilic felt referee Jon Moss' decisions to disallow Fabregas' goal, when the Spain midfielder seemed to be in line with the last defender, and Matic's second yellow card could easily have gone the other way.\nFormer Croatia defender Bilic admitted that he probably would have moaned too if Matic had been a West Ham player because the foul that led to the Serbia midfielder's second caution was borderline.\nMourinho did not turn up for his post-match news conference and it was left to England defender Gary Cahill to sum up Chelsea's deflated disposition.\n\"The mood in the dressing room is not great, like you'd imagine when you lose games,\" the Chelsea goalscorer told the BBC. \"The lads are devastated.\n\"You're left scratching your head sometimes. In the first half the Fabregas goal could have been given and we had the goal that was nearly over the line. That sums up the way we're going.\"\nChelsea, who are sixth from bottom with 11 points, were denied another goal when Kurt Zouma's first-half header came within millimetres of going over the line.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:18:34.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
