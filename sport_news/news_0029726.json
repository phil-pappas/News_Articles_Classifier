Specifically, Andover was able to sub out its forward line frequently, which helped the Warriors stay fresh in the unexpectedly hot temperatures and tire out their Walpole counterparts. \n“Coming in, they were confident but they still had a lot of respect for Walpole,” Noone said. “They got there early, they were maybe a little anxious at first, but getting a goal seven minutes in really helped change the conversation.” \nIn addition to Roche’s hat trick, Caroline Curtin had a goal and an assist, Jillian Hughes had two assists and Emma Farnham had one assist as Walpole dropped to 9-1-1.
