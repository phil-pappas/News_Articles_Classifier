Unlike the previous couple of years the usual air of expectation before the advent of Navratras that mark the beginning of the festive season, too, had been lacking fervour this year. Market watchers did not pin much hope on the sale front this time in spite of a 50 basis point rate cut announced by the RBI just before the beginning of the festive season. Real estate market, especially residential segment, has been witnessing a slowdown for the past 2-3 years, leading to sluggish housing sales and 4-5 years of delay in the completion of projects all over the country. In 2014 also the festive cheer had been missing with the top eight cities reporting 30-40 per cent lower sales as compared to 2010-2011. Less than 1,00,000 residential units were sold in the top eight cities in 2014 during the festive season. Even the developers’ move to extend the festival discount offers till the end of December had failed to elicit any positive response. According to experts the same story seems to be unfolding in 2015 also so far. According to consultant JLL India the residential segment is likely to see a slow sale pace during the auspicious period this year due to high prices in big cities and subdued sentiments in the property market. Increasing inventory is a major cause of concern for stakeholders with over 7,00,000 units lying unsold in NCR, Mumbai and Bengaluru and the absorption period touching the 36-month mark. According to figures provided by international property consultancy the value of unsold houses in the affordable and mid-segment category in top seven cities is at about Rs 4 lakh crore ($60 billion). Even the luxury segment, that is generally considered recession-proof has been affected with Rs 1 lakh crore value high-end homes lying unsold. Project delays of up to 3-4 years in many cases, especially in the absence of real estate regulation, has hit the buyer sentiment. Even the investors are backing out because of low appreciation and concerns over land and GST Bills. Thus, in this backdrop the festive season is not going to bring about any major turnaround in 2015. “Sales traditionally increase by up to 25-30 per cent during the festive season. However, this year we do not anticipate more than 15-20 per cent increase due to the fact that sentiment is still somewhat subdued and there is an affordability gap in the larger cities like Mumbai,” JLL India Chairman and Country Head Anuj Puri said in a report recently. Though this is the time when developers generally come up with discounts, freebies and offers to boost sales, this year these are also lacking the usual ‘big bang’. Freebies like air conditioners, modular kitchens, parking facility, club membership, gold coins and easy payment plans are on the platter to make the buyer finalise the deal. “The housing market is currently flush with options for prospective buyers and developers are offering discounts in almost all the projects, especially those which are ready-to-move-in”, said Puri. Keeping a brave face, the developer lobby is going all out to lure more and more buyers to park their funds in the housing segment. In the tricity region Sushma Buildtech has two offers for residential projects in Zirakpur. At Sushma Chandigarh Grande buyers will need to pay 30 per cent at the time of booking and the rest on offer of possession. “Unlike the usual 30-70 or 20-80 schemes, our offer does not require any financing. The customer need not make any payment beyond 30 per cent till offer of possession”, said Prateek Mittal, Executive Director, Sushma Buildtech Ltd. For its Sushma Elite Cross project in Zirakpur the group has a tie-up with the bank where it offers a No-EMI period for the customer for a period till 10 months after possession. In the NCR the prospective homebuyers have a lot of offers to choose from. Gaursons India Ltd. has brought schemes for three of its ready to move in projects. Under this, customers can book the units now and possession of the units would be given by Diwali. In another scheme, the group is offering cash discounts of up to Rs 10 lakh on 2 and 3 BHK flats priced above Rs 70 lakh. Manoj Guar, MD, Gaursons said, “The past six months have been very lean for the sector, and developers are banking on the festival season. With the approaching festive season, enquiries have also picked up 15 per cent, against last year. ” The Supertech group offered ‘9 Days of Navratras - 9 EMIs Free’ scheme during Navratras on all of its projects. The buyers booking flatsduring these nine days will not have to pay the first nine EMIs. Wave Infratech is offering a Tanishq gift voucher of Rs 1 lakh with every booking at Wave City Center (residential or commercial) and gift vouchers of Rs 41,000 on every booking at its hi-tech township, Wave City. The Fairwealth Group is offering the customers a chance to win ‘Renault KWID’ on its project Breeze Homes, Bhiwadi. The Prateek Group announced a bouquet of offers its projects namely Prateek Stylome, Grand Paeonia, Grand Carnesia, Prateek Edifice, Prateek Laurel and Prateek Wisteria. In all these projects, customers will get a complementary gold coin on every booking. In their premium housing project, Prateek Stylome in Sector 45, Noida, different sized units will come with different options such as free stamp duty, free club membership and free power backup of up to 5KVA. The Hawelia Group is offering 1 gold coin on every booking of 2BHK and 2 gold coins on every booking of 3 BHK at both projects-Hawelia Valenova Park & Hawelia Valencia Homes in Greater Noida West “The offers and freebies that are being made available during this period must be closely examined to establish their true contribution in terms of the overall value of the property, and the deal itself,” JLL advised buyers. Stating that hard discounts would be better for end users and investors, Puri said the buyers could consider the offers wherein developers waive stamp duty and registration fee as this translates into an actual saving.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:03:17.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
