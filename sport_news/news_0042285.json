All my friends who come to watch our games are like, 'Volleyball is so cool.' \"\nAnyone who watched last week saw Alechko play three great matches and help the Golden Knights defeat Ramapo, Ridgewood and Paramus.\nThe Record Female Athlete of the Week had 31 kills, 18 digs and four aces as NV/Old Tappan ran its record to 8-0.\nThe outside hitter said part of the reason for the team's success has been its new, more toned-down attitude.\n\"I think that's our mentality this year; stay calm,\" Alechko said.\n\"In previous years, we've had almost a frantic or nervous energy if we felt the game was getting tight. I think this year we're focusing on having fun on the court and staying relaxed.\"\nShe's also trying to stay relaxed when it comes to the all-important decision on where to go to college next year.\nWherever she goes, she said she has her heart set on playing volleyball and studying law.\n\"I dream of being a corporate lawyer,\" Alechko said. \"I know it doesn't sound like the most interesting thing in the world, but I'm really interested in the law and writing.\n\"My friend Libby [Scott] … her dad actually gave me some really great advice.\n\"It kind of inspired me to — not go in his path — but mold my path around what he did. I kind of saw myself following the same route.\"\nAlso nominated: Remi Nunziato of Rutherford and Mikaela Heyboer of Park Ridge for soccer; Amanda Manzo of Bogota for volleyball.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:11:04.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
