(Photo: Evan Siegle/Press-Gazette Media) Buy Photo \nThe Green Bay Notre Dame football team needed nine plays to turn an early deficit into a rout. \nThe No. 3 seed Tritons beat No. 6 seed West De Pere 49-13 in a WIAA Division 3 first-round playoff game on a rainy Friday night at Ted Fritsch Field, scoring four touchdowns in the second quarter in what felt like a blink of an eye. \n“The stuff you’re standing on has a lot to do with it, the turf,” Notre Dame coach John Nowak said when asked about such a successful offensive night in less than ideal conditions. “Really, the temperature, it was a nice night other than the rain. I may sound like I’m nuts, but it was really a nice night to play football.” \nNotre Dame will host No. 7 Wisconsin Lutheran in the second round next week. \nThis win was eight years to the day that Notre Dame beat West De Pere in a first-round game in 2007, which also was the last time the Phantoms failed to advance past the opening round of the playoffs. It’s just the fourth time in 18 playoff appearances that West De Pere is one-and-done. \nEverything started so promising for the Phantoms, too. \nWest De Pere (5-5) rode star running back Matt McNabb to a touchdown on the game’s opening drive. There were 10 plays called on the march to the end zone, and each was a run by the 5-foot-11, 170-pound junior. \nMcNabb rushed for 65 yards on the drive and 84 yards in the first quarter, but almost everything went bad for the Phantoms after that. \nThe Tritons’ offense exploded in the second quarter, needing those nine plays to take a commanding 28-7 lead at the half. \nDespite the rain, Notre Dame had no problem doing whatever it wanted in both the passing and running games. \nThe Tritons (8-2) started their barrage with a 43-yard touchdown pass from senior quarterback Robert Petitjean to junior wide receiver Ryan O’Connell in the opening seconds of the quarter. \nAfter Notre Dame forced a punt on West De Pere’s ensuing possession, it needed just three plays to take a 14-7 lead on a drive that ended with a tackle-breaking 31-yard TD run by junior running back Nate Ihlenfeldt. \nBut that was nothing. \nThe Tritons scored their next TD on two plays, this time on a 43-yard TD run by Ihlenfeldt. \nNotre Dame defensive back Johnny Santaga then intercepted a Phantoms pass to give the Tritons the ball at the West De Pere 25. \nThree plays later, Petitjean connected with O’Connell for a 24-yard TD and a commanding lead. \nThe Tritons put up 234 yards of total offense in the first 24 minutes. It included 125 rushing yards from Ihlenfeldt, who finished with 148 on 18 carries. \nIt was the seventh time in 10 games he has rushed for 130 or more yards. \n“As an offense, we are very explosive,” Ihlenfeldt said. “The line was getting great push, the holes were fantastic. Guys pulling and everything. It was great. \n“I thought Robert and all the receivers did a great job and saved us a bunch with long touchdown passes.” \nAs if things couldn’t get worse for the Phantoms, they watched Notre Dame sophomore running back Mike Gregoire return the opening kickoff of the second half for an 82-yard TD. \nIhlenfeldt made it 42-7 with a 1-yard TD run with 3:41 left in the third quarter, before junior running back Liam Gerl capped the Tritons’ scoring with a 2-yard run midway through the fourth quarter. \nMcNabb, who finished with 191 yards on 30 carries for West De Pere, scored the final TD of the game on a 23-yard run. \nIt was the sixth time this season the Tritons have put up 40 or more points, and it was the most points West De Pere has allowed since giving up 53 to Bay Port in Week 5 of the 2005 season. \nNotre Dame outgained West De Pere 342-199. \n“I like the way we have played all year, to tell you the truth,” Nowak said. “This is just a great group of kids. It’s fun to come to practice every day.” \nWest De Pere… 7 0 0 6 – 13 \nG.B.
