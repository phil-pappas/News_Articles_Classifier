The first five Royals batters recorded singles in the eighth.\nRoyals right-hander Wade Davis slammed the door with two scoreless innings of relief, sending the series back to Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium for the Game Five finale with the series tied 2-2.\nBy the end of the seventh, that scenario seemed unlikely. The Astros scored three times in the seventh inning to move six outs away from the American League Championship Series.\n(Editing by Andrew Both)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:52:10.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
