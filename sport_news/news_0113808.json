He played well against the Cardinals, completing 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns.“We were not shocked by his performance, but we were pleased by it,” Tomlin said.The Steelers (4-2) have gone 2-1 without Roethlisberger. However, Vick has struggled, completing 40 of 66 passes for 371 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:21:38.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
