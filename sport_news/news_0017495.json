Having been Kershaw-ed in Game 4 on Tuesday, here's what they now must do: beat Zack Greinke in Los Angeles, where he has started 18 times this year and never had a bad game. Good luck with that.\nYou have to go back to Greg Maddux in the mid-1990s to find another starting pitcher who was as on point in almost every start all season as Greinke was this year. He has been particularly sharp at Dodger Stadium: Greinke has allowed 21 earned runs in 18 home starts, including Game 2 against New York. He is 11–1 with a 1.52 ERA at Dodger Stadium this year (Los Angeles is 14–4 in those 18 Greinke games) and has never allowed more than three runs or pitched fewer than six innings.\nMLB Video NLDS Game 5 preview: deGrom, Mets face Greinke, Dodgers for NLCS berth by Cliff Corcoran", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:42:11.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
