Blatter speaks during the Preliminary Draw of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia at The Konstantin Palace on July 25, 2015 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Photo by Dennis Grombkowski/Getty Images After the FIFA corruption scandal shocked the soccer world, many wondered how president Sepp Blatter was escaping prosecution. Those worries subsided when Swiss authorities launched an investigation into the beleaguered leader. Now, things have quickly gone from bad to worse for Blatter. On Thursday, FIFA, the organization he once ruled with an iron fist, formally suspended Blatter, along with FIFA vice president Michel Platini and secretary general Jérôme Valcke (who was already on disciplinary leave) for 90 days. A fourth person, former vice president Chung Mong-joon was banned for six years.\n“The grounds for these decisions are the investigations that are being carried out by the investigatory chamber of the ethics committee,” said FIFA in a statement.\nThe 90-day suspensions can also be extended by another 45 days. If FIFA decides to go that route with Blatter, his exodus would come to an end on Feb. 20, just six days before the election for his successor is set to take place.\nIn Blatter’s absence, Issa Hayatou will serve as acting president. The Confederation of African Football president is the longest-serving vice president on FIFA’s Executive Committee. The 69-year-old Hayatou does not however, plan to run for the post permanently in February’s election.\nBlatter is said to be “disappointed” that he was not given the opportunity to be heard and attempt to clear his name in front of the ethics committee. His lawyers released a statement on his behalf.\n\"President Blatter looks forward to the opportunity to present evidence that will demonstrate that he did not engage in any misconduct, criminal or otherwise,\" read the statement .", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/sports/soccer/sepp-blatter-michel-platini-jerome-valcke-fifa-suspended.html", "http://www.espnfc.com/fifa-world-cup/story/2653469/issa-hayatou-to-be-acting-fifa-president-in-place-of-blatter", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2015/10/08/fifa-suspends-sepp-blatter-and-michel-platini-for-90-days/73567144/", "http://www.espnfc.com/fifa-world-cup/story/2653342/sepp-blatter-planning-to-clear-his-name-after-ban-lawyer"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:08:55.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
