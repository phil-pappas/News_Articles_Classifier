Johnson finished with six catches for 77 yards. \nThe Colts (3-2) extended their AFC South winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games. \nBrian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left. \nThe 40-year-old Hasselbeck was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck may not have been 100 percent either, after missing practice Tuesday with an illness. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:44:30.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
