Jones was suspended indefinitely following his arrest as a result of a hit-and-run accident in Albuquerque, NM in April. In late September Jones pleaded guilty to felony charges for leaving the scene of an accident and was given 18 months probation and community service. “We've made it clear to Jon that this new opportunity to compete in UFC is a privilege and not a right, and that there are significant expectations we have regarding his conduct moving forward,\" said UFC Chairman and CEO Lorenzo Fertitta. “We’re happy to read and see reports that he has embraced the terms of his plea agreement and is using this experience to grow and develop as a person.” Jones issued the following statement on his official Facebook fan page: \"I am grateful for the opportunity to resume my career and I am excited to show how much I've grown as a person outside of the octagon. It took me losing almost everything I had worked for to realize how much I had. I am blessed and humbled by the continued support of the MMA community and I can't thank my fans enough for their unwavering support through my ups and downs. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life and my career and let me assure you, the best is yet to come.\" No date has been set for Jones's return to the octagon. UFC President Dana White has said throughout the suspension that Jones's first fight could likely be a chance to regain his Light Heavyweight Title. Currently, Daniel Cormier owns the belt. Jones beat Cormier by decision in UFC 182 back on January 3. That fight was his last in UFC before it became known he failed a drug test, testing positive for cocaine, and then months after was involved in the hit-and-run accident.
