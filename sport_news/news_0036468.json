Pic/Atul Kamble \nMumbai, in reply, were in trouble at 45-2 at stumps on Day Two. Pacer J Kousik took a sharp, low reflex catch off his own bowling to dismiss the double centurion of the last match, Shreyas Iyer for 19. \nKarthik, who was unbeaten on 76 on Day One, batted with a silken touch. He hooked, pulled and drove at will. Except in the 90s, when Dhawal Kulkarni beat Karthik’s edge on a couple of occasions, the Tamil Nadu star enjoyed a smooth ride. \nKarthik knows yesterday’s innings was just a small step towards winning back his place in the Indian team. “I want to set the bar so high and score so many runs that they (selectors) find hard to ignore me,” said Karthik, who last played for India in an ODI in 2014. \nThe Mumbai bowlers tried hard to get a breakthrough in the first session, but had no luck. Karthik hit a fine cover drive off Shardul Thakur to complete his third first-class century against Mumbai and first in a decade. “I was a bit unlucky against Madhya Pradesh in the last match. I am happy with the way I batted here,” said Karthik. The 182-run seventh wicket partnership between Karthik and Malolan Rangarajan was finally broken after the lunch break. In the second over of the new session, Thakur succeeded in inducing Rangarajan to nick one to wicketkeeper Aditya Tare. \nFifer for Dabholkar Three overs later, left-arm spinner Vishal Dabholkar claimed his fifth wicket of the innings when he got a leg before appeal in his favour as Karthik once again lost his wicket while playing the sweep shot. “It (the sweep shot) has been my enemy and friend. It is a love-hate relationship. It’s a run-scoring shot and I like to play it. I know I have also lost my wicket many times playing that shot, but over the years I have mellowed down and don’t use it too often,” he said. \nThe Tamil Nadu tail tested Mumbai’s patience for sometime before surrendering to Kulkarni. Mumbai coach Chandrakant Pandit said they were unfortunate not to get wickets in the first session. “We conceded too many runs (131) in the opening session. Some decisions didn’t go our way, which was unfortunate,” he said.
