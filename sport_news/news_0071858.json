The series features Wegman's famed Weimaraners sporting Max Mara's 101801 coats, the double-breasted cashmere and wool beaver coats that are among Max Mara's most iconic garments.\nThe photo series actually dates to 2001, when, to mark the brand's 50th anniversary, Max Mara commissioned Wegman to create a series of images featuring the coat. He dressed his dogs accordingly, and the result was a classic series of photographs. This fall, a touring exhibition of the photos has been making the rounds of Max Mara locations around the U.S.\nIn conjunction with the tour, Max Mara is offering a special reproduction of 30 limited-edition 101801 coats. Exclusive \"Dogs in Coats\" notecards will be included with every purchase.\nThursday's event at the Max Mara boutique at 900 N. Michigan Ave. is 6-8 p.m.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56291907/turbine/ct-pets-dogs-in-coats-1021-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:21:54.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
