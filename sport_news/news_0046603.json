Email him at jon_wertheim@yahoo.com or tweet him @jon_wertheim .\nWhile thinking of Bud Collins, this week’s Mailbag….\nDo you really think Serena losing was a bigger upset than Pete Sampras losing to 145th-ranked lucky loser George Bastl at Wimbledon? Bastl had played for years and continued playing and as far as I know never beat another named player or broke through the top 70.\n— Max\n• I would put Bastl d. Sampras +# way up there on the list of all-time tennis upsets. But remember, that was in the summer of 2002 when Sampras was amid a miserable year. He had won zero titles to that point. He had lost in the first round at the French Open. He had lost in the previous Wimbledon tune-up. He was north of age 30 and the buzzards were circling. (Remember, this match was held on Court Two. That’s how far Sampras had fallen.) Serena—far and away the World No. 1— was upset playing in the semis of the U.S. Open, not only 26/28 of the way to an historic Grand Slam but she hadn’t lost a U.S. Open in four years.\n+ George Bastl continued playing until his 40s:\n# I don't want to pick on Boris Becker but after this match he led the chorus that Sampras was toast . That Sampras was able to win a major just two months after this debacle says a great deal about his powers and resilience.\nI found it surprising that in last week’s Mailbag you didn't comment on the Andy Murray-World Tour Finals-Davis Cup controversy. I think it penalizes Murray to have the Finals so close to the Davis Cup final. In fact, he is the only one penalized (unless his brother makes the World Tour Doubles finals, which makes GB penalized more than Belgium). Why is Davis Cup one week after the Finals? I seem to remember in the past the Davis Cup finals were the first weekend in December. Why can’t they be at the same time this year, too? (I see they are scheduled again next year for the same late weekend in November.)\n— Walter, Montreal\n• Ah, the tennis calendar strikes again.
