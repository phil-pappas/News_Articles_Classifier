Posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 12:02 am | Updated: 12:04 am, Fri Oct 16, 2015. West Virginia heads to Waco for No. 2 Baylor By Nicole Curtin TheDAOnline.com | 0 comments The West Virginia University football team is back on the road this weekend to take on the No. 2 Baylor Bears in possibly the biggest challenge it faces this season. Coming off a devastating loss to then-No. 20 Oklahoma State in overtime last weekend, the Mountaineers have several things to work on. Three lost fumbles against the Cowboys, as well as other issues like 107 yards lost due to penalties, have haunted West Virginia’s ability to finish its last two games. In the Baylor series, WVU leads 2-1, and this is the fourth time the two teams will face each other. Last year the Bears came in ranked No. 4 and in huge upset, West Virginia took the win. In 2014 the Mountaineer defense held Baylor to just 95 rushing yards and 223 passing, also sacking quarterback Bryce Petty four times. Saturday this defense will have to have the same kind of performance, and the offense will have to step up in order to win. The Bears enter the contest on a 5-0 record, having scored at least 55 against each of their opponents this year. The only team that came close was Texas Tech two weeks ago, who lost the game 63-35 but was actually hanging in there through the first quarter. Baylor scored 28 points in the first quarter alone against the Red Raiders and followed up with 21 more in the second, completing the takeover. While last week’s opponent for Baylor, Kansas, performed the way most people would anticipate, West Virginia brings a different test to Waco as well. The Mountaineer defense has been putting in work this season, ranking No. 4 nationally in fourth down defense, No. 9 in first down defense, No. 14 in third down defense and No. 1 in interceptions with 13. Following the loss of senior safety Karl Joseph last Tuesday, West Virginia started Jarrod Harper in his position; Harper proved he was willing to step up to the plate. The entire defense has to be on that same page this week. Head coach Dana Holgorsen said they will have to blitz against Baylor because its offensive line is just that good. \"You have to do whatever you have to do to get pressure,\" Holgorsen said. \"They are big and physical up front, they are going to protect with a tight end at times and a back as well.\" While stopping the Bears’ offense is not going to be an easy task, their playing style is not all that complex. \"It’s not overly complicated, you know how they’re going to line up,\" Holgorsen said. \"Obviously they have a few new wrinkles. Their up tempo is as fast as anybody. They’re going to run the quarterback at times, and when they have matchups, they are going to try to exploit you. No one does it better than them.\" Junior quarterback Seth Russell is averaging 305.4 yards per game, and the back up quarterback has been in play a fair amount of times, most likely based on the fact that no team has put a threat up against the offense. West Virginia junior quarterback Skyler Howard hasn’t had that kind of connection with his receivers so far this year. Howard is averaging 255.4 passing yards per game. Junior wide receiver Daikiel Shorts Jr. said the WVU offense needs to cohere more in order to succeed. \"As an offense, we definitely need to come together as a unit,\" Shorts said. \"As receivers, we need to do everything in our power to make sure that we’re running our routes hard, blocking properly and getting downfield. We have to do what we have to do.\" Baylor is going to be a big test for West Virginia. After losing their first two Big 12 games, the Mountaineers need to take a win sooner rather than later. Tomorrow’s game kicks off at 12 p.m. eastern time, 11 a.m. central time and will be broadcast on Fox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:17:42.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
