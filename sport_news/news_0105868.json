However, the team won’t need to replace Knight’s off-the-court leadership. \nAs part of her master's program in sports management, Knight joins the coaching staff as a graduate student manager. \n“As a grad assistant you’re just trying to learn as much as you can from everyone,” Knight said. “I can help the players make their lives a little bit easier, especially the freshmen because I know how tough it can be.” \nSchneider, taking over in his first season at the head of the program, is looking forward to Knight’s ability to relate and help the young players. The team is adding six freshmen this season. \n“She can go and put her arm around a young player and maybe they’ve had a really tough day or a difficult practice and say, ‘Hey, I was there. I know exactly what you’re going through,’” Schneider said. \nSchneider said the most important thing that Knight can bring to the coaching staff is the ability to effectively communicate with players. Just one year after playing on the team, Schneider said he believes Knight can help players adjust to college basketball being just a few years older than the players. \nFreshman forward/center Tyler Johnson has had this experience already. Since Knight joined the coaching staff, Johnson said she has been pleased with Knight’s ability to acclimate her to the reality of being a collegiate athlete. \n“She’s a really upbeat person. Anytime you’re around her the energy changes,” Johnson said. “She gives us energy before practice and after practice. She’s really motivating.” \nReplacing Knight on the court will be tough. Sophomore guard Lauren Aldridge will be the team’s go-to player. Just last season, Aldridge played nine more minutes than Knight last season as a freshman and shot 37 percent from the field. \n“Natalie was that person last year when I was in those freshman moments and very overwhelmed,” Aldridge said. “I’d always look to Nat, and Nat would always give me some positive reinforcement.\" \nShe added: “It’s going to be really helpful for me again to look over to her and for her to be like, ‘Lauren, take a deep breath.’” \nAldridge also highlighted the importance of Knight’s role in the coaching staff for the freshman class. The value of this, Aldridge says, comes in Knight’s one-on-one leadership style. \n“[Knight] has never been vocal,” Aldridge said. “With her being there every day, she’s already working with some of the girls individually. \n— Edited by Minami Levonowich Discuss Print Posted in Special issues , Late night , Sports , Mens basketball , Womens basketball on Wednesday, October 7, 2015 7:17 pm.
