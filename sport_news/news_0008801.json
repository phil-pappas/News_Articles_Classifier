By the time Ward found his groove in the third it appeared too late, although the Cuban did need attention for a cut above his eye. \nHowever, La Cruz was able to see out the fight largely untroubled, winning his third world medal in the process. \nWard's displays at the World Boxing Championships mean he has secured his berth at the Rio Olympics next year. \nWard said on www.rte.ie: \"Overall, it's been a great championships. I'm going back (to Ireland) with a silver medal and going to Rio. \n\"I'm going to learn from this now and all I can do is get better and improve with that fight and see how we go in the Olympic Games.\" \nMichael Conlan was crowned Ireland's first men's AIBA world champion on Wednesday after a unanimous points victory over Uzbekistan's Murodjon Akhmadaliev in their bantamweight final.
