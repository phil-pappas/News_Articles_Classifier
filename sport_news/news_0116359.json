Eagles bedeviled Jeff Seisser | Union sports editor Daily Jefferson County Union \nEVANSVILLE — In their three previous meetings the Jefferson and Evansville High School girls’ volleyball teams had to go the distance to produce the ultimate winner. And while Tuesday’s WIAA Division 2 Regional quarterfinal match only lasted four games, it was a battle to the very end — prolific for Evansville and bitter for Jefferson. \nThe fourth-seeded Blue Devils rallied from a one-game deficit to win the final three, advancing to the Regional semifinals with a 15-25, 25-13, 25-16, 25-19 win over the No. 4 Eagles. \nEvansville will face top-seeded McFarland in Thursday’s Regional semifinal. \n“I didn’t want it to go five, I wanted to beat them in three,”   Greg Fairfield. “We didn’t show up, so to speak — the first set we won basically because we’ve got more tournament experience.” \nJefferson looked like world beaters in Game 1, rolling to a 25-15 victory behind the outside hitting of senior Micah Kramer and serving of senior Mikaela Grant. Kramer had three kills, while Grant recorded three of her match-high five aces. \nBut from there things didn’t go the Lady Eagle spikers’ way. Evansville raced out to an 8-2 Game 2 lead and never allowed Jefferson back in, earning the 25-13 decision. \n“I was never comfortable with them,” said Fairfield about Evansville. “I told the girls this before: you beat them 25-15, they come back and beat you 15-25. We had to play all the way through and we just didn’t do it.” \nJefferson held just one lead, 4-3, in Game 2. Evansville kept a 1-to-2 point lead throughout, before senior Heather Messling stepped to the service line with her team leading 19-16, and rolled off three aces as the Blue Devils won going away, 25-16, to take a 2-1 match lead. \n“We started making a few errors in Set 2, and they weren’t make as many errors as they did in Set 1. Then they settled in,” Fairfield said. \nThe two Rock Valley Conference North Division rivals played five sets in their two regular-season meetings, splitting the pair, and even needed to go all three in a best-of-3 series at last Saturday’s RVC Meet, with the Blue Devils winning. \nJefferson was on a mission to force another fifth game, taking a quick 4-1 lead. The Eagles’ third point came on a massive spike by sophomore Emily Stendel that hit Evansville libero Courtney Bierman square in the face. Stunned but ok, Bierman remained in the game. \nStendel and Grant combined for a pair of kills during a 4-0 run, as Jefferson’s lead grew to 12-5, and another Grant kill gave the Eagles their biggest advantage of the game, 15-9. \nThe Blue Devils rallied, eventually tied the game at 16-16, and took their final lead on five straight service points from Rebecka Cronin. \nThe game and Jefferson’s season ended on an unforced error. \n“They came out on fire after that, they wanted it more,” said Fairfield. \nCronin had a huge night with a match-high 18 kills and made 21 digs. \nJunior Tierney Hall paced Jefferson with 10 kills and junior middle blocker Marissa Albrecht added nine, while senior setter Emily Finger handed out 37 assists and senior libero Andrea Kubicek had a match-high 22 digs. \n“Andy embraced the whole libero position, going from right-side defensive specialist to becoming a libero — she owned that position,” said Fairfield of Kubicek. “I think she’s one of the better one’s in the conference.” \nJefferson finished the season 10-21. \n“We were too streaky down the stretch, and unfortunately it carried into the tournament,” said Fairfield.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:18:53.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
