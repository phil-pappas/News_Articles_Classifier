The company is in the middle of converting the existing storefront to meet state safety requirements.\n\"With this industry, there's a lot\" of those safety mandates, said Beth Strautz, PDI's spokeswoman.\nThe proposed location has a home medical-equipment provider nearby, and it's just west of the Regal Cinemas Lincolnshire 21.\nAccording to a statement from the company, PDI \"will offer pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products including edibles, tinctures, concentrates, and buds. In addition, staff members will walk patients through the Illinois Medical Cannabis Card application process, from filling out forms to providing state-authorized fingerprinting and passport photo services.\"\nThe statement said the CEO of the newly formed company is Dr. Mark Mandel, owner of Mark Drugs, a 30-year-old compounding pharmacy with locations in Deerfield and Roselle.

In September 2014, Releaf announced that it had abandoned its plan for Buffalo Grove because of the location's build-out cost.\nOn Thursday, Village President Beverly Sussman said price did not appear to be any kind of hindrance for PDI.\nHarvest of medical marijuana begins in Illinois Tribune wire reports It's harvest time in southeastern Illinois.
