Guest counts fell by 4.1 percent in 2014, leading to annual sales falling 5.2 percent to $26 billion that year.\nMcDonald's overhauled its executive team last year to help streamline the operation and lead changes that include reducing menu items, developing a mobile app and taking a stab at the fast-casual market.", "external_links": ["http://www.mcdonalds.com/content/us/en/food/meal_bundles/alldaybreakfast.html", "http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Financial-Performance/2015/07/McDonalds_still_struggling_in.aspx?ID=%7B42F24431-73A5-40C1-8BA4-CB7EFF16D7EF%7D&cck=1"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:05:14.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
