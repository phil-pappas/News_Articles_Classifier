I’m sure it was worded wrong in the question that was asked to him. I basically say it and I say it all the time. During the conversation, I said of my (Boston Celtics) team in 2008, you’ve gotta have some luck, things have to go your way. You need all that.\" \nEven in trying to dismiss the perceived beef, Rivers can’t help but sneak in a subtle shot, basically calling Thompson “sensitive.” \nTo be clear, though, Rivers backed up his claim from earlier this week that he still respects the Warriors, despite the obvious dislike on both sides. \n\"But I respect Golden State a hundred percent,\" Rivers said. \"But I was surprised at how quickly they jumped on it. To each his own.\" \nThere is growing criticism across the NBA that the Warriors’ championship run largely benefited from a few lucky breaks. Every team they played had a significant injury to at least one, if not two, starters, while the Warriors were one of the healthiest champions in NBA history. In addition, the Warriors never faced the Clippers or San Antonio Spurs, the two Western Conference teams who theoretically provided the biggest challenge for them. \nRivers agreed with that assertion, telling Zach Lowe of Grantland.com last week that he felt the Warriors were fortunate during their playoff run. \n\"You need luck in the West,\" Rivers said. \"Look at Golden State. They didn’t have to play us or the Spurs.\" \nSince Rivers' comments last week, the Warriors have lashed out back at the Clippers and anyone else who doubts them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:34:36.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
