It's pretty understandable to turn into a mess during your first game. \nKristaps Porzingis wasn't that during his initial performance at Madison Square Garden, starting for the Knicks during their 100-81 victory over Brazil's Bauru, but he did admit to some understandable nerves after the game. “I could have done better,\" Porzingis said in an on-court interview. “I expect more of myself, so hopefully be better next time.” Later, Porzingis said the excitement of the Garden got to him. “I wasn’t totally focused,’’ Porzingis said. “I wanted to show everyone what I can do. That was in my head. I didn’t start good. Later on I refocused.\" \nPorzingis finished his first NBA performance with seven points on 2-for-6 shooting, including draining a couple of quick, catch-and-shoot threes. He had a solid off-the-backboard block, as well, though he did get pushed out of the post on a few occasions. \nThat's going to be the Porzingis experience during year one, though. Even his greatest supporters admit it's going to be a few years before he can make a true impact in the league. We saw some good. We saw some struggles. And regardless of whether those come against an NBA team or not, those traits will probably be consistent throughout the year. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
