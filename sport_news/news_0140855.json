He also didn't let it linger, something that impressed his older teammates.\n\"Some guys can put their heads down and get discouraged and totally take themselves out of the game after a mistake,\" offensive lineman Angelo Mangiro said. \"He didn't do that. He said he would make it up to us, and he did.\"\nBarkley made his first start for Penn State on Saturday in a 31-30 win over Maryland. It also was the toughest game of his career. The freshman from Whitehall High carried 20 times for 65 yards, a 3.2 yard-per-carry average well below his season average of 8.3. Maryland's stacked defensive fronts created little running space.\nBarkley also fumbled twice, losing one at the Penn State 31-yard line. Maryland converted the turnover into a field goal to take a 10-7 lead.\nThe Penn State report card: Maryland edition OFFENSE: B-.

Punter Daniel...\nRead the story The fumble resulted primarily from an inexact exchange, but Barkley still accepted responsibility. On the sideline, he assured teammates he would make up for it.\nAfter skipping the next series, Barkley returned to run several times out of the Wildcat formation. He had 43 of his rushing yards in the second half, helping produce two touchdown drives.\n\"Saquon bounced back and owned up to his mistake,\" Mangiro said. \"He showed a lot of maturity for a young guy.\"\nPHOTO GALLERY: Penn State outlasts Maryland 31-30 in wild Big Ten game\nDEFENDING ELLIS: Maryland quarterback Perry Ellis rushed for a game-high 124 yards and a touchdown, keeping the offense moving much of the day. But he also turned over the ball four times, with a fumble and three interceptions.\nPenn State's defenders called Ellis exhausting to defend, particularly when he tucked and ran on Maryland's third-quarter scoring drives. Ellis converted three third downs and threw a touchdown pass that gave Maryland a 27-24 lead.\n\"That guy's a great runner,\" Penn State's Anthony Zettel said. \"We took a lot of shots at him, hit him as hard as we could, but he just kept getting up.\"\nRISK/REWARD: Penn State coach James Franklin said he was impressed with Maryland's defensive game plan, which marinated during the bye week.\nThe Terps went \"high-risk, high-reward\" by challenging Penn State's run game and leaving the game to a cornerback/receiver contest. Players said that Maryland had used those looks before but never in such a saturated way.\n\"Basically, they said your receivers won't beat us,\" Franklin said. \"But we made big plays.\"\nThe Penn State postgame: Maryland edition Mark Wogenrich Complain all you want, but Penn State wasn't about to join.

Franklin said that Brendan Mahon, who did not start for the first time this season, did an admirable job in place of right tackle Mangiro, who was injured during the game. … Cornerback Grant Haley made his second interception of the season. Trevor Williams and Malik Golden also had interceptions. … The Lions had four sacks, marking their 30 t h consecutive game with at least one.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c3853/turbine/mc-penn-state-football-defeats-maryland", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c4cdb/turbine/mc-penn-state-football-maryland-grades-20151024", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c101c/turbine/mc-pictures-penn-state-vs-maryland-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-25T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:57:38.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
