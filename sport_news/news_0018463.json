The 36-year-old Dupuis has been limited to 55 games the past two seasons because of a torn ACL and separate bouts with blood clots. He missed the first month of this season with a lower-body injury unrelated to his history with blood clots. \nLast season, working his way back from an ACL tear, he scored six goals in 16 games. But he missed the final five months of the season because of the career-threatening blood clots. \nHe worked his way back to score a goal in four preseason games this season prior to his lower-body injury. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:04:37.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
