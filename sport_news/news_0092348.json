I will not change unless my manager or the people from my club or my supporters tell me so. \n“No, I don’t need to change. Because I have done nothing wrong. During my football career, many, many times other players have done stuff to me, like kick me but I am not a cry baby. “So I think the supporters saw that was unfair and so the supporters, the manager and the club have given me a lot of support.” \nCosta insisted he is not concerned referees might target him after being punished again for an incident originally missed by the officials. \nHe added: “I had never had any problems with officials. None of the bans that I have had, have been down to problems with officials. \n“Sometimes I get booked. But that is part of the game it is just normal. I am just hoping that they see me differently now. \n“But I think they are very professional and they will keep going the same way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:42:59.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
