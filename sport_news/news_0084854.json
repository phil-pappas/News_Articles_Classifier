The pathologists then issue autopsy reports, which are critical pieces of evidence in homicide cases. \nHowever, the pathologists contracted with the counties don’t issue their final reports until after they have received the results of toxicology tests, which are routine in murder cases and can take up to 12 weeks to get back, officials said. \n“The difference between now and the past is our (previous) pathologist would issue the autopsy report before the toxicology (results),” said Dan Blasdel, Franklin County coroner. \nDefense attorneys are hesitant to allow the victims’ bodies to be released because autopsy reports — which can help determine if a second autopsy or additional tests are needed — haven’t been issued, officials said. \nDefense attorneys end up ask the courts to withhold releasing bodies until at least the autopsy reports are turned over. \nBlasdel and Benton County Coroner John Hansens told the Herald that second autopsies are rarely performed in murder cases. \nBodies used to be stored in coolers at the Benton County morgue until they could be released to funeral homes, officials said. \nBlasdel has changed that policy in Franklin County. He said he’s releasing bodies to funeral homes after the autopsies are complete \nHowever, defense attorneys can still step in and ask judges to stop bodies from being buried, which was recently done in the case of murder victim Eduardo Angon Del Villar . \nColumbia Memorial Funeral Chapels and Gardens now charges the defense attorney in the case $50 a day because of the amount of time the body has been held, owner Kathryn Tate said. \nFuneral homes storing the bodies for such long periods of time leads to deterioration, said Blaze Titus, owner of Hillcrest Memorial Center in Kennewick. In many cases, families can’t have viewings or open caskets because of the condition of the bodies. \nTitus suggested funeral homes be allowed to embalm the bodies after autopsies to help preserve them for funerals. \nTitus, who has been in the business for more than 25 years, told the Herald that the toll withholding bodies takes on victims’ families is heartbreaking. \n“How can a family grieve?” he said. “How can a family have their funeral service if day after day, month after month, they keep holding the body?” \nBlasdel and Hansens agree that bodies are held too long and it brings added suffering to victims’ families, they said. \n“They can’t get closure,” Blasdel said. “When the body is finally released and they think they can have the funeral, they are appalled at the condition of the body.” \nWithholding bodies has been an ongoing problem in the area for some time, though it has come to light more recently with high-profile cases, Hansens said. \nOfficials in Benton County plan to meet soon to discuss the matter and see if there are solutions, he said. \n“We are trying to come up with a policy and agreement that meets the needs of everybody involved,” he said. \nTyler Richardson: 509-582-1556; trichardson@tricityherald.com ; Twitter: @Ty_richardson Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:48:50.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
