The potent power play had stalled and the team’s three-game win streak appeared at an end. \nSo much has been made about the Capitals’ bolstered top-six forward corps, thanks to the offseason additions of T.J. Oshie and Justin Williams. The upgrade in skill has delivered: In three games before the Vancouver meeting, the Capitals had outscored opponents, 14-4. \nAnd while Coach Barry Trotz will happily take those skillful scores at any point, he was happy to see a grittier win Thursday against the Canucks, in which the first two scores in the 3-2 win came from the checking line crashing the net . The Capitals play late on Friday night against Edmonton. \n“They were the ones that just put the work boots on and went to work,” Trotz said of his third line . “They sort of pulled the rest of the group into the fight.” \nIn the first period, Jay Beagle raced down the right side and Jason Chimera kept pace on the left, stopping in time to deflect in a pass from Beagle across the crease. Then with Washington down, 2-1, in the third period, Beagle posted up in front of the net, and the puck from defenseman John Carlson’s wrist shot landed between Beagle’s stick and skate. It popped up and he tried to swat it in; goaltender Ryan Miller lost sight of it as it went in over his shoulder. \nAlex Ovechkin scored the game-winner in the third period, but the captain credited Beagle’s line with the win. That trio had been Washington’s shutdown line, its priority to be a defensive force against opponent’s top scoring lines. But with Miller saving one Washington one-timer after another, it took determined shots from the crease to break through. \n“They can play anyway,” Trotz said. “I think Beags got some confidence last year and had a career year for us and continues to get better. I think Chimera has had a really good start to the season, and same with [Tom] Wilson. They keep it simple, they put pucks to the net and they have enough skill where they can make plays. But they haven’t lost their identity. \n“Their goals were Beagle fighting off a guy and Chimmer using his speed to get to that back post and made a play. The last one was just hard work to get it to the point and sort of crash the net and get pucks through. The skill is great, but sometimes you’ve got to put the work boots on.” \nIn a 6-2 win against Calgary on Tuesday, the Capitals started to show flashes of scoring from hockey’s “dirty areas.” To give the Capitals a 4-1 lead, center Evgeny Kuznetsov sent a pass into the crease, where Oshie punched the puck in from point-blank range, through the goaltenders legs. \nOn a hot offensive night for Washington against a slumping Calgary team, Oshie’s score was largely overlooked. But that kind of goal coming from one of the team’s most skilled forwards represented the identity Trotz wants the Capitals to take on. \n“We want to have a balance,” Trotz said on Tuesday night. “You can have all of the skill in the world, but if you’re not working, it’s really useless. We want to have a little bit of a blue collar mentality.” \nHe saw just that two nights later. The Canucks are one of the stronger opponents the Capitals have faced in this young season, and Washington has historically struggled in British Columbia, not winning there since 2001. When the Capitals’ skill was stopped, their scrappiest line delivered the win, the kind of scoring equilibrium the Capitals will need down the stretch. \n“We’ve been putting it on ourselves to be more offensive and try to chip in,” Beagle said. “It’s not going to be every night. But we’ve got to be getting chances every night. It takes a little pressure off Ovi and the top two lines offensively when you can chip in.” Isabelle Khurshudyan covers the Washington Capitals.
