For William Roberts, that rings especially true. The senior at Bolivar has developed the best vision on the boys soccer team, which has allowed him to become arguably their speediest stiker in his first year as a foward. That work ethic has garnered plenty of respect from his teammates, and his attitude rubs off. \"He's always got that big smile and is happy a lot. He lives life to the fullest,\" head coach Steve Fast said. In 20 years of leading the Bolivar soccer program, Fast has coached more than one player that fits that description. But he has never called out to a player that couldn't hear him. Roberts, like both his parents, was born deaf. He learned to speak as a boy when he attended the Moog Center for Deaf Education in St. Louis, living their with his mother while his father stayed in Bolivar . He received a cochlear implant on the right side of his head and learned to speak. At four years old, he had already found his way to the pitch.\"I just started playing soccer and loved it,\" Roberts said. \"It was a graet way to connect with hearing kids.\" Like any young athlete, his skills grew as did his body, and by his first year in high school he was starting on varisty for the Liberators. \"I had more motivation to prove people wrong and to prove to myself that I can do this and do it at a better level than hearing kids.\" As much as Roberts challenged himself to be the top player wherever he landed, the hurdle was just as high for his teammates and coaches to learn to communicate. The cochlear implant gives him a different type of sound in his right ear than people with functioning, but he no longer wears it while playing. \"His teammates weren't able to verbalize where they were or what they wanted him to do,\" Fast said. \"There were a lot of hand signals.\" Still, Roberts showed enough for Fast to move him from midfield to forward this season, often putting him at the head of a play with his entire team to his back. \"They used some sign language, basic signs that I taught them. They also wave if they want to get my attention othe field,\" Roberts said. \"During goal kicks, I'll look around to see if anybody's waving their hands. I'll be looking around constantly.\" The choice paid off as Roberts had buried seven goals and picked up three assists with four games left in the regular season. \"His instincts are just incredible and he plays hard, looks to pass the ball quickly and just find his teammates through visual effects,\" Fast said. Playing hard is nothing new to Roberts. It's the product of a promise he made to himself long ago. \"I have more motivation to prove people wrong and to prove to myself that I can do this and do it at a better level than hearing kids.\" The rest of Bolivar's regular season will be played on the road, meaning Roberts was already honored during senior night on Oct. 1, his parents at his side. He still has a tennis season to look forward to as the Liberators' top-ranked male. He will attend the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, which boasts a large deaf population. After that, he plans to go into the medical field. What job, exactly, is still in the air, but whatever platform he chooses, he wants to motivate hearing-impaired youth to pursue their goals. \"I can make connections with hearing kids to show people that even a deaf kid can be good at soccer and can do anything else.\" Filed Under :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:43:28.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
