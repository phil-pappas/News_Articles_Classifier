(AP) - Leonard Fournette of LSU was able to win the offensive player of the week honor from the Louisiana Sports Writers Association for the fourth straight week, but this time there was a slight catch. \nHe has to share the award with Grambling Quarterback Jonathan Williams who had a second consecutive big performance for the high-scoring Tigers. \nRoyce LaFrance of Tulane won the defensive player of the week and Jonathan Barnes of Louisiana Tech took the special teams vote. \nLSU’s Fournette became the first player in SEC history to have three straight 200-yard rushing games in a 44-22 win over Eastern Michigan. Williams had five touchdowns passing as Grambling defeated Jackson State, 59-27. \nLaFrance had three sacks and forced a fumble in Tulane’s 45-31 American Athletic Conference win over UCF. Barnes had a career long 50-yard field goal for the Bulldogs in Louisiana Tech’s 43-14 over UL-Lafayette. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:15:51.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
