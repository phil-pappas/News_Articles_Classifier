(AP) -- Indiana coach Tom Crean hired former player Derek Elston as the new director of player development Monday.\nThe native of Tipton, Indiana, will help with mentoring, life skills, administrative operations and support services.\nElston played on the Hoosiers' 2012 Sweet 16 team and the 2013 Big Ten regular-season championship team.\nThe move comes after an offseason in which three Indiana players were kicked off the team, and in the midst of a 19-month series of legal run-ins that have included some of the program's best-known players.\nElston scored 498 points in an injury-marred college career and earned academic all-league honors and the Big Ten's sportsmanship award as a senior. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in sports broadcast communication and a master's in sports administration, he played two seasons overseas.\nSports & Recreation Tipton, Indiana   4149/85227   574/2000  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:16:48.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
