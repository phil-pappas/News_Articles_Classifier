Pleasant News \nNEW LONDON â€” The New London football team rolled to a 50-6 homecoming win on Friday night against Van Buren. The Tigers dominated from start to finish, holding the Warriors to 19 total yards and going for 440 yards of their own. \nThe Tigers scored their first two touchdowns in the first quarter. Tyler Stevenson ran for a 33-yard touchdown to begin the scoring and Austin McBeth scored just over a minute later on a 30-yard touchdown run of his own. \nLeading 14-0 early in the second quarter, quarterback Blake Nehring found McBeth on a 12-yard touchdown pass to put the Tigers up by three touchdowns. Reno Chiri recorded a safety later in the quarter, and the Tigers led 23-0 at halftime. \nVan Buren cut the lead to 23-6 with a touchdown run to start the second half, but the Tigers got back to work with two third-quarter touchdown passes. Nehring found Stevenson for three yards midway through the quarter and McBeth for 40 yards with just 2:03 left in the third, and the Tigers jumped back up 37-6 after three. \nMcBeth scored his third touchdown of the game at the start of the fourth quarter. The senior scored on a 15-yard run. Then, to put an exclamation point on the game, Jayden Flowers scored his first touchdown of the game on a 30-yard touchdown run. \nMcBeth finished with an astounding 269 total yards and three touchdowns to lead the team. Stevenson had 36 yards rushing and nine yards receiving with a touchdown on the ground and in the air. Nehring went 10-20 with three touchdowns and three interceptions. \nThe defense was dominant all day, stuffing the Warriors on nearly every drive and forcing four turnovers. McBeth finished the game with 10 total tackles to lead the team and also had one fumble recovery. Chiri, Stevenson and Colton Francis each had four. Flowers had two picks in the game, Stevenson had one and Isaac McSorely had one. \nNew London moved to 3-4 overall and 2-3 in district with the win. The Tigers will travel to Cardinal next week before returning home to take on Lone Tree in the final regular season game. They would likely need to win both to reach the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:55:45.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
