At least most of them were.\n While Evan Turner was back on the court from his sore right knee and Amir Johnson returned after missing the second game of the trip with a cold, rookie guard Terry Rozier watched the proceedings from the sideline because of some swelling in his left knee. According to coach Brad Stevens, Rozier is expected to be out three to five days.\n Jonas Jerebko missed the session because, said Stevens, he picked up the same illness that bothered Johnson and some others on the trip to Milan and Madrid. Also, Perry Jones (death in the family) was out and not expected to return to the club until tomorrow...\n Though the Celts won their games over Olimpia Milano and Real Madrid by 33 and 15 points, respectively, Stevens sounded a bit like Bill Belichick in his review.\n \"Well, you can go through every possession and find something, so the score doesn’t mean a lot,\" he said. \"One thing we didn’t get a chance to do is work on any late-game situations against someone else, but as far as technical things, we can improve on, offensively and defensively, literally every possession.\n \"We still have to get a lot better. We still have to continue to move the ball. I thought the effort was good. The emphases have been I think well embraced. It's just a matter of now cleaning things up and getting ready to play against better teams. Our focus will just be on cleaning up things that we didn’t do well and making sure we're more sound in our system. We missed a few things that we need to make sure we don’t miss anymore, especially on the defensive end. And then offensively I think we just need to continue to emphasize spacing and figuring guys' strengths out. But I think we've got a good foundation on that end.\"\n Today's workout was a deviation from the initial plan.\n \"We showed a little bit of film, and then the goal of today was, we originally had this as a film and lift day, but we just felt like we needed to kind of run the cobwebs out,\" Stevens said. \"You saw even at the end it was just getting shots up and touching the endline and just to move a little bit. Not rocket science today. We did a lot of offensive review fullcourt, did a lot of shooting and called it a day.\"\n The Celts will be increasing their workload tomorrow as they prepare for preseason games in New York against the Nets Wednesday and Knicks Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:10:07.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
