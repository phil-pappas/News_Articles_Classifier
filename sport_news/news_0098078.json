(Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images) I really hope the Padres are shut out at least one more time in their last four games of the 2015 season. Finishing the year with 19 shutouts just seems sick and wrong. That number means far too much to have it in any way associated with this level of ineptitude. The Friars were blanked again on Wednesday night, losing to the Brewers 5-0 in the next-to-last game of the year at Petco Park. Milwaukee rookie Zach Davies gave up five hits and struck out six in his 7.0 innings of work. For the Padres is was just more of the same stuff we've grown aggravatingly accustomed to. They went 0-6 with runners in scoring position, squandering what few opportunities they had to push runs across. As if the final score was not nauseating enough left fielder Justin Upton might not play again this year (or for the Padres ever again). The team's home run leader ran headfirst in to the left field wall chasing a triple by Logan Schafer. He needed help to make the walk from the warning track to the clubhouse. If Upton is not available for the series finale against the Brewers or any of the final three games at Dodger Stadium he becomes a free agent and could very well be too pricey for the Padres to bring back. The last home game of the year starts at 3:40 Thursday afternoon. Ian Kennedy takes the mound in what might also be his final appearance in a Padres uniform against Taylor Jungmann.
