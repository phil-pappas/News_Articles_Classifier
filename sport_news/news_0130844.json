Jones appeared to be in significant pain both as he was treated on the field and while on the sidelines as the offense was on the field, but returned for the first defensive snap of the second half and played the rest of the game. \nWhitworth's absence on Wednesday was listed as non-injury related, which means he was given a veteran's day off. He has been given that at least one day per week this season and did almost every week last season. \nIloka took himself out of Sunday's game with an ankle injury and was replaced by Shawn Williams. Iloka played 43 defensive snaps in the game and Williams played 31. \nJones, Whitworth and Iloka were all seen during the 30 minutes practice is open to the media taking part in warm-up and stretching. Jones and Iloka are probably just being given an extra day to allow their injuries to heal. \nThe three players who were limited participants on Wednesday were cornerback Leon Hall (non-injury related, which means likely a veteran's day off); cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick (shoulder) and tackle Andre Smith (hip). \nKirkpatrick got hurt trying to tackle Steve Smith as he crossed the goal line in the third quarter of Sunday's game in Baltimore, but remained in the game and played all 74 defensive snaps. \nSmith missed some practice time last week due to a buttocks injury, but played in Sunday's game. \nDefensive tackle Pat Sims was a full practice participant after missing Sunday's game due to a hip injury and defensive lineman Marcus Hardison also was a full participant. Hardison missed the first three games of the season due in part to a knee injury. \nGeorge Iloka Photo: Local 12 staff photo \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
