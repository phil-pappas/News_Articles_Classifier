(Ryan Blackwell — GameTimePA.com) \nGREENCASTLE &GT;&GT; When Olivia Fogelsonger smacked the final kill Thursday night, several members of Waynesboro's girls volleyball team burst into tears. \nAnd for good reason. \nNot only did the final nail come in the fifth set, it came against rival Greencastle-Antrim, and it sealed the Maidens' possession of the Mid Penn Capital Division title for the second year in a row. \n\"It was definitely because it was such a hard-fought victory,\" Fogelsonger said. \"There was a lot put into this game, and there was a lot at stake. Plus, they are our rivals, so I think that's what got everyone so emotional.\" \nWaynesboro coach Kim Saunders said, \"And having to come from behind to get it done, to prove that we're actually good. I'm extremely proud of the way we fought; we haven't had to fight like that all year.\" \nThe 3-2 victory for the Maidens (17-0, 11-0 MPC) did not come easily. For the first time this season, undefeated Waynesboro had to come from behind. Greencastle (10-7, 8-4 MPC) won the first set, 25-21, before Waynesboro tied it up, 25-22. Again, the teams went back and forth with the Blue Devils claiming a 25-22 win in Set 3, and Waynesboro forcing a fifth set with a 25-17 win. \nThe Maidens clinched the victory with an 15-11 win in the decisive fifth. \nThe second set was particularly key, as G-A had a chance to go up 2-0. The Blue Devils led the second set, 18-13, before Waynesboro went on a nice run. That run was keyed by former Blue Devil Brycelin Spidel. After the Maidens pulled it to 18-15, Spidel laid down six kills in a row to once again give the Maidens a lead.

We were trying as much as possible when she got out or was in the back row to score as many points as possible because when she's up there, she's going to score regardless of what we do.\" \nSaunders said, \"This match means a lot to Brycelin. She's never won the Capital Division, for one, but she also used to play here. She's feeling more comfortable with us, and she has really come a long way with us both on the court as an individual and in the classroom.\" \nGreencastle seemed to lose steam in the fifth set. The Blue Devils committed five hitting errors in the final set alone. \n\"I think we were hesitant and worried about making mistakes instead of just being all-out aggressive and not caring about the result,\" Eagler said. \"We want them to play aggressively and not worry about failing. I think that crept in. It was still a good effort, but that was a little bit of the difference in Game 5.\" \nWaynesboro also showed off the strength of its hitters in the final set. Fogelsonger had four kills in the set, Ciara Rosenberger added two and Spidel notched one. \n\"There is a lot of talent on this team,\" Fogelsonger said. \"It's not like one person has to carry the whole weight of the team, so it makes it tough for the blockers and defenders on the opposite side because we're so smart about where we place the ball.\" \nFor the Blue Devils, Keri Gearhart led the way with 15 kills, and Gabby Baughman did a fine job stepping into the setting position in the absence of Chloe McKenzie. She racked up 40 assists.
