(Wilfredo Lee/Associated Press) \nJust because he isn’t starting, that doesn’t mean the Houston Texans don’t want Ryan Mallett on the sideline. \nThe Texans’ quarterback missed the team’s charter flight to Miami for the game Sunday against the Dolphins but hopped on a commercial flight and will dress for the game, ESPN’s Tania Ganguli reports . \nTiming has been an issue for Mallett before. He missed a training camp practice days after Brian Hoyer was named the Week 1 starter. He said he had overslept and promised to buy a better alarm clock. Mallett stepped in to start when Hoyer struggled, going 1-3. \nCoach Bill O’Brien pulled Mallett in favor of Hoyer during the game against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 5 and Hoyer was the starter the following week.
