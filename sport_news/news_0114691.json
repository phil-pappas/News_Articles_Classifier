It marks the third time in his career Huesman has earned a monthly honor from the conference. Huesman helped guide the Mocs to a 3-1 mark during September. A two-time SoCon Offensive Player of the Week, he ran and threw for over 100 yards in two of the four games. He also had over 300 yards of total offense in two of the four contests. The senior signal-caller rushed 75 times for 376 yards and three touchdowns and completed 59-of-92 passes for 639 yards and six touchdowns during the month. He became just the fourth player in league history to account for more than 9,000 yards of total offense in a career. Defenses had a hard time getting the ball out of his hands as the Mocs are No. 3 in the FCS on third down (54.8%) and No. 7 in the nation in time of possession (34:05). Against Jacksonville State, he broke the school record for career rushing touchdowns (33), and set a new UTC record for passing TDs against Mars Hill (58). He posted 132 yards on the ground against Presbyterian to move into third place all time at UTC with 3,183 career rushing yards. Chattanooga (3-1, 1-0 SoCon) is set to take on Furman (3-2, 1-0 SoCon) this weekend at Finley Stadium. Game time is set for 1:00 p.m. (E.D.T.) on Saturday, Oct. 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:42:59.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
