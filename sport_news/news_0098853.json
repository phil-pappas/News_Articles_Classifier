We're going to fight to the last play of the game.\"\nHackenberg sustained a knee gash in the second half against Ohio State but did not miss a snap. He appeared less mobile in the second half, however, when the Buckeyes sacked him three times.\nBarkley and Lynch, both playing for the first time in three games, took fourth-quarter hits from the Buckeyes. Barkley, who rushed for a game-high 194 yards, showed no apparent effects from the ankle injury he sustained against San Diego State.\n\"There's just that fine line, and there's not an exact point, there's not an exact time, it's just the right thing to do,\" Franklin said of deciding when to pull his starters. \"You've got to figure out when that is. But what I'm telling you is, the personality that I want this team to take on is that we are going to fight you from the opening whistle to the last whistle and see what happens.\"\nFOUR THINGS WE LEARNED FROM FRANKLIN'S PRESS CONFERENCE\n1. NOT AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH\nDefensive end Carl Nassib said after Saturday's game that the Lions played cautiously, particularly once Ohio State turned to quarterback J.T. Barrett. Franklin agreed Tuesday.\n\"We got tentative, which is not who we've been,\" Franklin said. \"â€¦We need to be aggressive in the way we play. We need to be aggressive in the way we coach and call the game.\"\n2. INSIDE PRESENCE\nFranklin said his offensive line has made a \"gradual, slow improvement\" this season but struggled against the Buckeyes, particularly inside.\nOhio State's defensive tackles won the matchup against guards Brian Gaia and Brendan Mahon, which made a difference in pass protection. Franklin said that the team's pre-game focus on defensive end Joey Bosa produced matchup problems elsewhere.\n\"That was a matchup that we did not win on Saturday,\" Franklin said. \"We went into it with our plan focusing on Bosa, Bosa, Bosa, Bosa. Bosa did some nice things, but I think the real issue was their [defensive] tackles matched up against our guards.\"\n3. WHAT ABOUT THE PUNTING?\nFranklin said he continues to work with punters Chris Gulla and Daniel Pasquariello on translating their practice performances to games. But it has been an on-going process over the past two seasons.\nLast year, Penn State abandoned its directional-punting concept in favor of a kick-and-cover strategy. That probably won't happen this week, though, against Maryland return specialist William Likely.\n\"That's something we discussed about obviously taking some of that pressure off [the punters] and allow them to bang it as far as they can down the field and put the pressure on the coverage unit,\" Franklin said. \"I don't think this is the week to do that considering the impact that Mr. Likely's had on games this season so far.\"\n4. LOVE FOR THE PENNSYLVANIA TEAMS\nPitt coach Pat Narduzzi made a comment Monday \"a talented quarterback with a bad play-caller\" that could be interpreted as a jab at Penn State.\nAsked about it Tuesday, Franklin said he's \"happy\" for the football teams at Temple, Pitt, Villanova and East Stroudsburg (his alma mater) and wouldn't read into Narduzzi's statement.\n\"There have been other times in other things that have happened that people have read into things that were not there, looking to try to get hits on websites or try to create some drama that was never really there,\" Franklin said. \"I've got tremendous respect for all the universities in this state.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2015/10/19/Pitt-s-Narduzzi-takes-jab-at-Penn-State-university-pittsburgh/stories/201510190137"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:50:17.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
