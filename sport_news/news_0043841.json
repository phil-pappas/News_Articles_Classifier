Getty \nNovak Djokovic has clinched his ninth title of the season in another dominant display of tennis against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the Shanghai Masters final. After crushing Andy Murray in Saturday's semi-final, the world no. 1 beat his French opponent in just 78 minutes to surpass Roger Federer's haul of 24 Masters titles with a 6-2 6-4 win. \nHis dominance of tennis in 2015 can be measured by his hugely impressive record over the past 10 months which includes an unbeaten run of 17 matches and wins in three of the year's four Grand Slams. \nTsonga claimed an impressive win of his own in the semi-final stage to see off a resurgent Rafael Nadal but was broken four times in the opening set as the Serbian got to work. The world no. 1 was broken himself but immediately broke back before seeing out the set. \nTsonga provided sterner resistance in the second set, matching the Serbian until he double faulted at 4-4. Djokovic didn't pass up the opportunity to take the advantage, serving out for the win in style. \n\"Not many guys are able to do that. It's really impressive,\" said Tsonga, when asked about Djokovic's incredible 2015. \"Today there is nothing to say. He's playing a lot better than everybody, I think. He's really consistent. You have to be in your best shape to beat him anyway, and everybody knows that it's not easy to play your best tennis every match. I think his level is just better than everybody for the moment.\" More about Novak Djokovic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:03:02.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
