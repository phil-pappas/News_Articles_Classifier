Maddie Kaczinski and Carly Hasken earned spots in the state meet at Fort Dodge for Northeast’s girls. The top 15 individuals in each race advanced. \n“This is a tough course, it’s like a roller coaster,” Rebels Coach Mike Mattis said. “You have to change gears all the time. \nSchmidt finished fourth in the 5,000-meter boys race in 17 minutes, 7.14 seconds, while Kennicker was eighth in 17:20.25 and Butler placed 14th in 17:53.08. Kaczinski (20:42.39) placed eighth in the girls race, while Haskens took ninth in 20:55.35. Makenna Franks finished 16th in 21:32.04, missing a trip to Fort Dodge by one place. Franks picked up a personal best by two seconds. \n“The fact we’re going to state with three guys and two girls is good,” Mattis said. “Not as well as we would’ve liked, but all is not lost.” \nThe Rebels took fourth in the boys race with 118, four behind Davis County, which claimed the third and final team spot for the state meet. The margin would have been greater except for some misfortune for Davis County. \nDavis County senior Zach Hougland, ranked seventh in the state in Class 2A, was the first to cross the finish line but was disqualified for aiding another runner. \nAccording to Scott Jackson of the Ottumwa Courier, a CNHI sister newspaper of the Herald, “the Davis County senior was already across the finish line and headed back to camp when Mediapolis runner Garrett Hinson collapsed in front of him just before crossing the finish line.” \n“The kid was going into the finish line and totally collapsed. I was just 150 feet away and saw no one was coming to help him,” Davis County Coach Josh Husted told the Courier. “Zach was walking back to our team camp and saw this was an emergency situation.” \nHougland went to help Hinson, but since Hinson finished the race, it technically was helping another runner and both runners were disqualified. \n“He just wanted to see if he could help the kid. The kid put his arms around Zach to help himself up and finished the race,” Husted said. “I got called into the field house and was informed that, since the kid finished the race, Zach was considered to have helped him.” \n“Zach knew it might hurt his finish, but he chose to do something heroic instead.” \nAs a result, Josh Keller of Columbus was declared the winner in 16:50.87. \n“It was unfortunate, but the silver lining is that (Hougland) does get to run at state with the team,” Mattis said. \nMid-Prairie won the girls race with 54 points, five ahead of Williamsburg. Mediapolis (82) rounded out the advancing teams, while Northeast placed fourth with 116. Julie Hollensbe of Williamsburg was the individual champion in 18:47.35. \nNielsen 18th for Indians \nMONTICELLO — Camanche’s Alexandra Nielsen placed 18th to lead Camanche at Thursday’s Class 2A Monticello state-qualifier. \nNielsen ran the 5,000-meter course at Monticello High School in 21 minutes, 13 seconds. The top 15 individuals qualified for next Saturday’s state meet in Fort Dodge. Bailey Mensinger was the second Camanche finisher, taking 27th in 21:48. The Indians took sixth in the team race with 198 points. \nAusten Clark led the Camanche boys with a 34th-place finish in 18:49. The Indians placed ninth as a team with 236 points. \nPaige Holub of Monticello was the girls champion in 19:22, while Matt Manternach of Monticello won the boys race in 16:31. \nCLASS 2A COLUMBUS STATE QUALIFIER \nGIRLS \nTeam standings \n(Top 3 qualify for state meet) \n1.
