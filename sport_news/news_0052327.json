The Lady Wildcats have won seven consecutive and hope to keep their streak alive through today's semifinal and final rounds. \nSophomore Shelby Worsham will attempt to do her part as the defending state singles champion. She advanced through Monday's openers with a first-round, 6-0, 6-0 victory over Sierra Schwartz of Bismarck, and again by 6-0, 6-0 over Nicole Swann of Harding Academy in their quarterfinal match. \n\"Shelby is incredibly consistent, and she works very hard at her game,\" Episcopal Coach Andrea Barnett said. \"She practices more than when we just play out here. She practices on the weekend and takes pride in how well she performs. I think that has a lot to do with her success.\" \nWorsham is scheduled to play Jessica Shearman of Haas Hall today in the semifinal round beginning at 9 a.m. Shearman advanced with a 6-0, 6-2 first-round victory over Anna Beth Ingram of Bismarck, and a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Macey Decker of Mountain View. \nThe other girls semifinal will be Emily Seegraves of Piggott against Vanessa Salinas of Haas Hall. \nWorsham, who won the singles title last year with a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Elisha Davis of Jessieville, said Monday after her quarterfinal victory that she had not yet looked at the draw and consequently wouldn't know who her semifinal opponent was until they met on their court. \nBut Worsham did say she was pleased to play Swann. \"We've played about four times, and I always look forward to playing her,\" she said. \"She's really sweet, and she's a good player.\" \nWorsham said she had never seen Swann play better. \n\"We had some good points,\" Worsham said. \"She hit it really hard today, and her slices were going in, and that's a difficult spin to deal with. I was constantly nervous, and that just shows that she played well. She was more consistent and hit it hard.\" \n\"I feel really good about the way I played,\" Swann said. \nSwann said there had been times in the past when she wondered what she was doing on the same court with Worsham. \n\"She hits them where you don't think they're going,\" Swann said. \"I kind of expect that she's going to hit them one way and then it goes cross court. She has really good placement.\" \n\"She's just an overall, very good, very consistent player who doesn't miss much,\" Barnett said. \"Shelby moves her feet very well and anticipates very well. When she can anticipate what's going to happen, then she can turn the play into her attack. Then she can start to move her opponent around and do whatever she wants. She rarely plays on the defensive side. She's usually the one who dictates the point.\" \nSports on 10/20/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:46:17.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
