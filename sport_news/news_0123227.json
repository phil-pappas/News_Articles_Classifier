Chris Murray , cmurray@rgj.com 9:36 a.m. PDT October 22, 2015 Wolf Pack guard Marqueze Coleman was voted Nevada's best overall player by his teammates. (Photo: Troy Babbitt/USA TODAY Sports) \nThe Wolf Pack basketball team underwent a major renovation this offseason. \nOut was coach David Carter and his staff. In was Eric Musselman and his staff. \nOut were players Michael Perez, Robyn Missa, Stelios Papafloratos and Patrick Conroy. \nIn were players Lindsey Drew, Cameron Oliver and Juwan Anderson, who are immediately eligible. Also in were transfers Leland King, Marcus Marshall, Jordan Caroline and Sam Williams, who must sit a year. \nThe Wolf Pack held its annual media day Wednesday at Lawlor Events Center and to get to know the roster a little better we asked the team’s scholarship players a few questions. Here are the results. \n(Editor’s note: Players could not vote for themselves). \nQuestion: Who is the team’s best shooter? \nAnswer: Eric Cooper Jr. 11; Marcus Marshall 2 \nIn short: This one was nearly unanimous as Cooper almost ran the table. As a freshman last year, Cooper hit just 25.7 percent of his 3-pointers and 29.8 percent overall, numbers he said he was disappointed with. But Cooper has excellent form and instead of splitting time between the guard positions like he did last year, Cooper will exclusively play shooting guard this year, where he can focus on his shot rather than facilitating. Marshall, a transfer from Missouri State, hit 45.6 percent of his threes last year. \nQuestion: Who is the team’s best dunker? \n\nAnswer: Cam Oliver 12; Kaileb Rodriguez 1 \nIn short: This one was unanimous as every player on the team except for Oliver, who wasn’t allowed to vote for himself, picked the true freshman forward. Despite tearing his ACL in high school, Oliver is “a crazy athlete,” according to his teammates. AJ West even said Oliver, who originally committed to Oregon State out of high school, is already better than 95 percent of the players he’s gone against in the Mountain West. Expect a lot of minutes (and dunks) from Oliver this year. He’ll be starting soon enough. \n\nQuestion: Who is the team’s best athlete? \nAnswer: D.J. Fenner 5; Cameron Oliver 4; Tyron Criswell 4 \nIn short: A split decision as Fenner narrowly takes the win. The son of a former NFL running back, Fenner has had that plus athleticism since he came to Nevada in 2013. He’s hopeful the Wolf Pack’s quicker tempo pace of play this year allows that athleticism to flourish. Oliver, the aforementioned “crazy athlete,” also checked in with four votes as did Criswell, who averaged 9.2 points and 4.1 rebounds last season. He’s more of a sneaky athlete that an electric one, but Nevada has its share of athleticism. \n\nQuestion: Who is the team’s strongest player? \nAnswer: AJ West 5; Tyron Criswell 4; Jordan Caroline 3; Elijah Foster 1 \nIn short: It makes sense West, the team’s center, is the strongest player. He muscled his way to the NCAA lead in offensive rebounds last year when he averaged a double-double. Criswell also got his share of votes as did the newcomer Caroline, who like Fenner is the son of an ex-NFL player (Simeon Rice is his dad). Caroline played center in high school, power forward at Southern Illinois last year and is moving to the wing at Nevada. The slimmed-down Foster, who lost 20 pounds this summer, also got a vote. \n\nQuestion: Who is the team’s most competitive player? \nAnswer: Marqueze Coleman 5; Tyron Criswell 5; D.J. Fenner 1; AJ West 1; Jordan Caroline 1 \nIn short: Musselman has tried to breed a competitive spirit in practice, which is aided largely by his intensity, which is unyielding. Coleman, who has taken a key leadership role this year and is Nevada’s most respected player, has been active in pushing the team in his senior season. Criswell played the hardest from first whistle to final whistle last season and became a fan favorite for his effort. Veterans Fenner and West each got a vote as did the newcomer Caroline, who has looked good in practice. \n**", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:24:39.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
