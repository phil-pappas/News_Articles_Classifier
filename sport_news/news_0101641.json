He hasn't had opportunities to laugh often in a year that has been anything but fun.\n\"The kids don't know [the movie] … I'm not sure I could take it,\" he finally said. \"I'm living it.\"\nTavani was the first to mention the movie in which Murray's character awakens at 6 a.m. every day to the music of Sonny and Cher's \"I've Got You Babe\" only to learn it's Feb. 2 all over again and he has to relive a somewhat bizarre series of events in Punxsutawney, home of Phil, the world's most famous groundhog.\n\"That's exactly what it seems like,\" he said about a Lafayette season in which almost every game has more than a few of the same elements and ends with him going to bed on Saturday night haunted by the thoughts of another defeat — seven of them in eight games, to be exact.\nThe Leopards were drilled by Holy Cross 42-0 on Saturday in Worcester, Mass. — the exact score by which they were whipped by Harvard the previous week and very little different from the 38-7 loss to Georgetown, and 35-7 loss to Fordham during their recent losing streak.\nSputtering offense. Breakdowns on defense. Not-special teams. Injuries to key players. Zeroes on the scoreboard. Heads hung low.\nAs another famous \"actor\" — Yogi Berra —might say, \"Déjà vu all over again.\"\n\"I never really appreciated [\"Groundhog Day\" the movie] much other than [Murray is] an extremely funny guy, but that's what I'm going through,\" Tavani said.\n\"There are some good things there, believe it or not. I've never been through this. It's new territory for me to navigate, but I have enough experience and I've been around a long time to know the fine line between winning and losing and we're struggling like heck to get on other side.\"\nWhere do you start to try to make sense of a month of Saturdays in which you've been outscored 157-14 in four games and will have had five players undergo in-season surgeries after wide receiver Matt Mrazek has his broken clavicle fixed this week?\nLafayette's health-care plan is getting a workout in 2015, for sure.\nTavani brought his offensive coordinator, Mickey Fein, and defensive coordinator Art Link from the press box to the sideline on Saturday so they could interact more closely with some of the many young players who have gotten significant playing time during this injury-riddled season and might need some special attention.\n\"Not a major [deal] in terms of why,\" Tavani said, \"just a matter of communication with the young men.\"\nThese young kids have not been accustomed to losing, so, Tavani said, \"it's hard not to let frustration get to you. As soon as something goes wrong, there's that overwhelming feeling that, here we go again.\"\nBut the more people on the outside would like to tear things apart, the more Tavani and his staff and the players are determined to continue to do whatever they can.\nLafayette has no more long trips — home games with Bucknell and Colgate, a bye week and the 151st Lafayette-Lehigh game in Goodman Stadium.\n\"It's an honor to be able to coach these young men; unfortunately, I haven't been able to deliver for them,\" Tavani said. \"As long as they work hard and give me the energy and effort, somewhere along the line it will pay off. This is not easy to swallow. There are important lessons to learn, but right now, it bangs away at you.\"\nRetired sports columnist Paul Reinhard is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:53:41.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
