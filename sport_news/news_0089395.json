We don't try and run a lot of crazy and wacky stuff like a lot of little league teams. We're the feeder team for Livonia Franklin, so it helps that we've received a lot of support from the high school's coaching staff.\" \nOne unique feature of the Blue Jays' varsity coaching staff is that it is void of players' fathers. \n\"There is no daddy ball going on,\" Allam said, smiling. \"Whatever you get, you have to earn and the boys know that. \nMembers of the Blue Jays are pictured following last week's eighth victory of the season.

Four of the six teams in each division – Novi won the North Division with a 5-0 mark – qualify for the three-week playoff format. \nAmong the team's standouts this fall have been quarterback Jacob Kelbert, running backs James Carpenter and Rocco DiPonio, Yumon Crowell, Reece Reeves and Brendan Miller. \nSunday's first-round game is set for 3 p.m. at Bentley Field. \newright@hometownlife.com 1212 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN 7 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.hometownlife.com/story/sports/2015/10/20/livonia-blue-jays-flying-high-at-8-0/74305182/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:59:30.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
