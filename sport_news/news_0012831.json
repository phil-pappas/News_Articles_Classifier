Less than a minute, in fact. \nEmma Booth scored the first of her three goals just 43 seconds into the game to spark a 7-0 victory for the top-seeded Crusaders over visiting Sidney on Friday afternoon in a Section 4 Class C girls soccer quarterfinal at Brewer Memorial Stadium. \nNotre Dame lost its previous game, 2-0, to Dryden in the Interscholastic Athletic Conference Large School final Saturday at Tompkins Cortland Community College. The Crusaders had allowed only one goal in their first 13 games coming into that contest. \n“On Saturday we didn’t have our best game and we knew that,” Booth said. “So we wanted to come out today and just play better. … I think once you get an early goal, it gets the whole team pumped and ready to go and we know that we can win this game.” \nLaurel Vargas added two goals in the first 2 minutes, 4 seconds of the second half to extend a 3-0 halftime advantage. Camille VanderMeer chipped in a goal and two assists, and defender Victoria Schutrum netted the final goal with 17:44 left off a rebound of her own penalty kick as Notre Dame improved to 14-1. \nThe Crusaders will host fourth-seeded Trumansburg (11-5) in a semifinal at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday. The Blue Raiders were a 5-0 quarterfinal winner over 12th-seeded Bainbridge-Guilford.

We had a good week of practice. I think it showed today. \n“We stepped up right from the beginning. Passing I thought was exceptional early in the game. We were really moving the ball well. The movement off the ball was really good. And I thought we maintained it pretty much the whole time.” \nThe Crusaders finished with a 38-2 advantage on shots and they had eight corner kicks to none for ninth-seeded Sidney (9-6-2). \nGoalkeeper Jolene Krom, who made 23 saves, helped keep Sidney within 2-0 before Booth scored on a penalty kick with 1:53 remaining in the first half. Vargas scored 50 seconds into the second half, then came back with another score off a header just over a minute later, with Booth assisting. \n“The third one was a big one,” Weber said. “It seemed like we were really dominating a lot with the wind and I think 2-0 at the half, that could have still let them feel like they were still in it.” \nSaid Booth: “We just know it’s sectional time and we need to step it up. It’s do or die.” \nOn Twitter: @SGAndrewLegare Read or Share this story: http://stargaz.tt/1S1r6jU TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:12:45.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
