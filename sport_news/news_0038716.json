Similar tournaments are held in Europe and South Africa, and Faircloth himself has played in the British Disabled Open. \n“I was skeptical to even go because I never wanted people to think that I have what I have,” Faircloth said. “But when I went, it was something bigger.” \nAnd that’s the feeling he wants to bring to other disabled golfers here in the U.S. \n“We don’t have that level of competition,” Faircloth explained. “And that’s sad, because you’re just leaving out a lot of golfers.” \nFaircloth already has a nonprofit organization in place, but says he needs help – especially with marketing and finance -- to see his dream of a U.S. Disabled Open tee off.
