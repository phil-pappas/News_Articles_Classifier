Given his retirement announcement Wednesday, a look back at his brief but stellar beginnings in the IndyCar Series is instructive. 1 Related \nAnd there, sitting in the middle of nowhere, amid clouds of red clay and amid the grumpiest stanza of his racing career, Tony Stewart was beaming. \n\"You ever seen him smile like that?\" the director asked the cameraman, someone who'd befriended the racer after covering him for years. \n\"Sure,\" the photographer replied. \"But only when he's at a place like this.\" \nOn Wednesday afternoon Stewart officially announced what had been widely reported at the start of the week and widely rumored for much longer before that. After the 2016 season he will end his career as a NASCAR Sprint Cup driver, continuing in his role as co-owner of Stewart-Haas Racing, moving to the front office as Clint Bowyer moves into his iconic No.14 Chevy. \nStewart doesn't want 2016 to become \"a retirement tour,\" but that's exactly what it will be. He doesn't really want us to talk about his legacy, but we're going to. And it might take the entire year to sort out exactly what that legacy is. \nHe will be a first-ballot NASCAR Hall of Famer, the only driver to win a championship in America's top two motorsports series, taking the 1997 IndyCar title and three NASCAR Cup Series championships, Winston, Nextel and Sprint. \nHe wasn't the first driver to attempt the same-day Indy 500/Coca-Cola 600 double, but he was the first considered a legitimate shot to win both. He was already a racing legend before he'd even gotten a crack at the big leagues, becoming the first driver to sweep USAC's top three series -- Midget, Sprints and Silver Crown. Tony Stewart Career Highlights \n• June 29, 1997 -- 1st IndyCar Series Win : Stewart drove only three full seasons in Indy Car, but he won the title in 1997 despite winning just one race. Stewart picked up the victory at Pikes Peak, leading a dominating 193 of 200 laps in the win. • Sept. 11, 1999 -- 1st Career NASCAR Win : Stewart dominated, leading 333 of 400 laps (still a career high in laps led) to pick up his first career win at Richmond. Teammate Bobby Labonte finished second, about one second back. It was the first of a then-NSCS rookie-record three wins. • May 27, 2001 -- Stewart Does the Double : Tony Stewart becomes the first driver to run the Indianapolis 500 and NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 on the same day and complete all 1,100 miles. He finished sixth at Indianapolis and third at Charlotte. • July 2, 2005 -- 1st Win at Daytona : Stewart picks up his first points-race win at Daytona (he had won several non-points events at the track). Overall, Stewart has won 19 different races at Daytona in all major races, second only to Dale Earnhardt. • Aug. 7, 2005 -- Brickyard Win : Stewart passes Kasey Kahne on a late restart with 11 laps to go to win the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis. Stewart had made five Indianapolis 500 starts, leading 122 laps, but could never win that race. • May 16, 2009/June 7, 2009 -- Breaking Through With SHR : Stewart drove his first 10 Sprint Cup Series seasons with Joe Gibbs Racing, but before the 2009 season, he broke away to form his own team, Stewart-Haas Racing. His first win of any type as an owner/driver came in the 2009 All-Star Race; he led only the final two laps. He went on to get his first points win the next month at Pocono. • Nov. 20, 2011 -- Chase Title in Tiebreaker : Stewart didn't win at all leading into the 2011 Chase, but he won a Chase-record five races in the 10 playoff races, including three of the final four. Heading into the finale, Carl Edwards had a three-point lead over Stewart, who had to pit early because his car was damaged, putting him back in 40th. However, Stewart rebounded to win, taking the championship over Edwards on a tiebreaker, the closest finish in NSCS history. • June 2, 2013 -- Last Cup Win : Stewart's most recent Cup win came more than two years ago at Dover. Stewart passed Juan Pablo Montoya on Lap 398, the first time Stewart led all day, and he held on to lead the final three laps for his 48th career win, tying him with Herb Thomas for 13th all time. -- ESPN Stats & Information \nIn the years since, he took a throwback page from the others who came before him in those series, such as A.J. Foyt, Parnelli Jones and Mario Andretti, punctuating his \"day jobs\" by racing somewhere in some machine nearly every night of the week. \nTo him, that was always the \"real racing.\" He said on more than one occasion that the money he made as a NASCAR superstar is what allowed him to do what he really loved, short tracking. (In fact, he would absolutely take offense to the reference in the previous paragraph that described NASCAR and IndyCar as the big leagues and not including sprint car racing on the list.) \n\"That's what makes him a legend among any of us who have made our living out here racing five nights a week in the dirt,\" World of Outlaws legend Steve Kinser said earlier this year. \"He got so big so fast, but he never got so big that he was no longer one of us.\" \n\"The world will never know what all he has done to keep short-track racing alive in this country,\" explained his childhood hero Foyt, the reason Stewart runs the number 14. \"He owns teams and tracks and all that, but it's also calling a short track somewhere and saying, 'Hey, I think I'll come up there and race Wednesday night, tell everybody so you can sell some tickets.' Or helping some old retired racer pay his medical bills. That's the stuff people don't know about.\" \nIt's the stuff they do know about that makes the Stewart legacy so complicated. It started with the temper tantrums, hated at first back when they were so frequent, and embraced later on, when they were triggered only occasionally, framed up as a wayback machine into NASCAR's rough-and-tumble past. \nOn a rainy November night in 2011 at the Homestead-Miami Speedway he produced one of the greatest one-night jaw-dropper performances in the history of American motorsports, physically manhandling his 3,400-pound Chevy through the field to win the season finale and his third Sprint Cup title, his first as a driver-owner. \nWhen he arrived in the media center, he had to answer champagne-soaked questions about firing his crew chief, which he'd done leading up to the race. \n\"There's always something, isn't there?\" he said that night. \"That won't keep us from enjoying this. This is too good not to enjoy.\" \nBut in the summer of 2013, the good times ended. He suffered horrifying injuries to his right leg during a dirt race at Southern Iowa Speedway. One year later, another short-track incident, this time in upstate New York, took the life of young racer Kevin Ward Jr. and became a news cycle nightmare. The first accident led to months of physical rehabilitation. The second has led to mental rehabilitation, not to mention ongoing lawsuits from the family of the deceased. \nStewart hasn't raced on a dirt track since Ward's death. He hasn't been in any race that wasn't NASCAR-sanctioned. Admittedly, he also hasn't been himself. \nHis closest friends and coworkers, the ones who lined the walls of the auditorium for Wednesday's announcement, have spent so much of the last two years telling tales of dark days behind closed doors. \nAt 44, he has faced the cold brick wall that all great athletes eventually plow into, the realization that whatever it was that they were born with, that they always had that mere mortals did not, that allowed them to dig deep and conjure magic like that night at Homestead, is no longer there to be grabbed. \nHe said during Wednesday's press conference that there had been several times during this, the longest winless streak of his 17-year Cup career, he'd been ready to retire out of frustration. He had originally planned to walk away this November, but was talked into one more year. But he also was quick to say that his injuries and Ward's death had \"zero\" to do with the timing of his retirement. \nNow the same people who talked him into one more year are once again beginning to tell stories of \"Old Tony\" returning, his fire reignited by way of a target placed out over the horizon. Perhaps the kind of spark that might just find one more trick in that tattered bag of greatness. Tony Stewart said one reason to come back for one more year was to say farewell to the fans. Sean Gardner/Getty Images \n\"This added year is not a ride-it-out year,\" Stewart said, pointedly. \"We're going to gouge our eyes out all we can to win races and win another championship.\" \nIt was a rare serious moment amid an hour-long press conference that would have played well at the local Chuckle Hut. He joked with co-owner Gene Haas about running for his new Formula One team. He took self-jabs over his prickly relationship with the press. He divided up admissions that the last two years \"have their challenges\" and saying he had no serious career regrets with jokes about still knowing how to \"nut it up\" by going 200 mph at Texas Motor Speedway and saying he could let it hang out in 2016 because \"I don't have to worry about making anyone mad and having to race them again the next year.\" \nAnd he admitted to a reporter from his hometown newspaper in Columbus, Indiana, that he hadn't had enough time at home, only 21 days this year. Years ago he bought his childhood home, the place where he grew up visiting all those Indiana short tracks, finding heroes in Saturday night racers known only to the grandstands around them. \nThe only racing he's retiring from is NASCAR Sprint Cup racing. All that other stuff is still out there, a schedule that he refused to elaborate on Wednesday, remaining non-comital on returning to sprint car racing and only saying repeatedly that he was \"excited about the racing I can do now.\" \nStewart keeps a list of every racetrack he's run and every race that he's won. There are dozens and dozens of each. And there are just as many tracks he still wants to see before his ultimate and final retirement, which isn't likely to come until, in his words, \"I retire from living.\" \nThat's a lot of wooden bleachers to stretch out in. And the look he'll have there will be the same as the one he wore on Wednesday. \nSmoke was smiling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:13:00.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
