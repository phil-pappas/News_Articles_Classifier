The district administration today disbursed compensation among farmers at Kauni village in Gidderbaha subdivision, which led to resentment among farmers. The revenue officer (patwari) handed over cash amount of Rs 11, Rs 28 and Rs 44 to some of farmers. On the other hand, some politicians got cheque of big amount. As a result, some farmers even refused to accept the meagre compensation saying that the state government had rubbed salt on their wounds. Sadhu Singh, a farmer, said, “I had sown cotton crop on three kanals. However, the administration handed over me just Rs 28 as compensation. I am even unable to think of what to do with this amount.” Further, as per the list, the administration decided to give just Rs 11 to one Mahinder Kaur, who did not come to take this so little compensation. Charan Dass, patwari of Kauni village, said, “The assessment of losses has been done after the physical verification of fields and revenue records. Those getting little amount as compensation have more than one owner as per the revenue records. The compensation amount has been divided among them, so it looks less.” The state government is giving compensation to the farmers on the basis of Rs 8,000 per acre. However, this is not the first time when the farmers got so little compensation. Earlier, they had received meagre amount in compensation for damage due to rain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:12:03.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
