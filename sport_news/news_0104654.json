The King was limited to a career-low 46 starts overall last season, missing 21 games with the vascular injury he sustained on Jan. 31.\nThe previous year, Lundqvist started four sets of back-to-backs, going 1-3 with a 4.01 GAA on the second night of what was Vigneault’s first season behind the Blueshirts’ bench. The King started six sets of back-to-backs in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season, five in 2011-12, 10 in 2010-11, seven in 2009-10, nine in 2008-09, 12 in 2007-08, 11 in 2006-07 and five in his rookie season of 2005-06.\nVigneault did not officially confirm Lundqvist as Saturday’s starter, but was unable to stifle laughter while going into his familiar refrain of, “If I were a betting man …”\nBackup Antti Raanta is expected to get his first start as a Ranger for Tuesday’s match at the Garden against the Jets.\nThe lineup is likely to change for Saturday’s rematch after Tanner Glass, Emerson Etem and Dylan McIlrath all sat out for the second straight game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:42:11.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
