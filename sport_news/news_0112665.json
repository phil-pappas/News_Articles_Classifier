Before Jesse Lingard's substitute appearance in the 3-0 win over Everton, the youngster had not played a competitive game for Manchester United since his debut in August last year. \nBut the manager clearly likes what little he has seen of the 22-year-old, who was thrown into the starting XI in Moscow as Juan Mata and Memphis Depay kicked their heels on the bench. \nSky Sports pundit Matt le Tissier said: \"This is a crucial game, so it's a big call from him.\" But Lingard could be satisfied with his performance. \nThe youngster, who started on the right but frequently popped up in pockets of space in the middle, was neat and tidy in possession and involved in the build-up to the goal. \n\"I wouldn't say he looked out of place at all,\" said Le Tissier. Lingard is likely to find himself back on the bench on Sunday, but he has given his manager something to think about. \nMartial, who is still only 19, has had a brilliant start to life at United, but there was a rare glimpse of immaturity when he needlessly handled the ball for CSKA Moscow's penalty, an incident his manager later described as \"stupid\". \nIt looked as though his moment of madness might cost United, but he redeemed himself with his well-taken equaliser. He now has five goals in nine games since his expensive arrival from Monaco. \nMartial started his United career as their No 9, but for the second consecutive game he was deployed on the left. He impressed in the position against Everton, but this was a more muted display. Are his talents wasted out wide? His headed winner was classic centre-forward play, after all, and Van Gaal might be wondering whether to move him back into the middle on Sunday. \nMoving Martial back into the middle would mean Wayne Rooney would have to make room. The skipper's goalscoring performance against Everton showed he can still do the business as a striker, but he cut an isolated figure against CSKA Moscow. Of United's starting XI, only David de Gea had fewer touches (40). \nIn his defence, there was very little in the way of creativity behind him, but he should have done better than to head Ander Herrera's cross straight at Igor Akinfeev in the 60th minute. \n\"Obviously I want to score goals to help the team be successful,\" Rooney said before the game. \"But the main objective in my career is not personal goals, it's the team's success.\" Now Van Gaal must decide whether Rooney up front is the best formula for his side. \nOne of the toughest decisions Van Gaal faces for Sunday's game is who to play at right-back. Summer signing Matteo Darmian has been first-choice since his arrival from Torino, but Antonio Valencia might fancy his chances of starting in the Manchester derby after impressing against CSKA. \nThe Ecuador international's rampaging runs up the flank were United's biggest attacking threat. In total he attempted 10 crosses, four of which found a United teammate, including an excellent delivery for Martial's goal. Valencia was solid at the other end too, winning possession more times (eight) than any of his teammates.
