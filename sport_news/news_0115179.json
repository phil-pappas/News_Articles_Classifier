And I think we are. We’re on track. We need to continue that path.” \nIt turns out that other than Shelton Gibson, who is emerging as a potential star, none of his receivers have risen to levels he would have hoped coming into the year, and the depth has been so shallow as having to take quarterback David Sills and use him at receiver this past week and having him make major contributions. \nGibson’s play has been spectacular at times. \n“No. 1 for us is getting really close,” Holgorsen said of Gibson, who caught a 70-yard touchdown pass and returned a kickoff 100 yards for a second TD. “We’ve got to get the other guys to continue to develop, continue to mature, continue to build confidence. \n“We’re not there yet, but we’re going to get there pretty quick.” \nNo one doubts Holgorsen when he makes that prediction, as he has created top-line receivers wherever he has been, and with Jovon Durante, Devonte Mathis, Gary Jennings and Ka’Raun White to work with along with Sills, he has no shortage of talent to develop. \nWhite, a junior college transfer, is the most intriguing, as he is a big body and the brother of last year’s All-American wide receiver Kevin White. He came in late, so naturally he figured to be a late bloomer but got his feet wet last week. \n“Ka’Raun has been on campus since June,” Holgorsen said, noting he missed spring ball. “Kevin was on campus for a year before things started clicking. I’m not comparing the two. I won’t.” \nNOTES: Holgorsen called CB Terrell Chestnut day-to-day with a shoulder injury. He has had a lot of problems with his shoulders and will need the extra time. The injury list is growing. LT Yodny Cajuste was “banged up” in the game and will rest this week. Orlosky “could hardly walk out there” and also will rest this week. And Holgorsen defended the restricted playing time he has given RB Wendell Smallwood, saying he had not practiced the last two weeks and those who questioned his lack of carries were off base. And finally the fall-off in production from last year’s Lou Groza Award finalist PK Josh Lambert is due from a preseason injury that lingered and then being under the weather the past couple weeks. \nFollow Bob Hertzel on Twitter @bhertzel.
