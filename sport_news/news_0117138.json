WEWS Previous Next \nBRUNSWICK, Ohio - Browns rookie defensive lineman Xavier Cooper had his first NFL sack in the Browns game against the Chargers. It was a moment many people believed would never come to fruition. \n“People my whole life was telling me you're stupid. You're not smart enough in football. You're not fast enough. You are not strong enough.\" \nIn ninth grade, Cooper was diagnosed with a learning disability. \n“It was frustrating but football kind of brought me along and once I became so talented at football coaches starting coming down, saying, this kid has an opportunity to play college ball. He is talented,” recalled Cooper. “From there on out I figured out I got to get my school together.” \nHis parents, teachers and friends all helped him to find ways to succeed in the classroom. Ultimately Cooper took classes at a community college before he went on to Washington State where he finished his career with 13 sacks. Academically, he is eight credits shy of a criminal justice degree, which he plans to finish after his rookie season. \nAfter football he aspires to become a school principal so he can aid others the same way in which he was helped. \nWhile he appreciates those who pushed him along the way in his journey, he also has not forgotten the doubters. Cooper has a few words for those who never believed. \n“I just say thank you,” Cooper said with a smile. “Thank you for the motivation.” Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
