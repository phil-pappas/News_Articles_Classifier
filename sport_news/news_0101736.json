It was too late to enter the Hong Kong Open, and all the invitations had been taken. \nThat's where Beem stepped in. \nThe European Tour said it approached Beem about the situation, and Beem agreed to let Poulter have his spot in the field. \nPoulter thanked Beem on Twitter for giving up his invitation. \"Where would you like to take you for dinner?\" he tweeted. \nThis might have been more valuable than that. European Tour membership is required to play in the Ryder Cup, even the captain's picks. Poulter has a 12-4-2 record in the Ryder Cup, and he was largely responsible for Europe's record-tying comeback to win in Medinah in 2012. \nGetting the spot in Hong Kong was only part of the drama. Poulter needed a visa, and that was only returned to him about two hours before he boarded a flight from Orlando to New York to make the connection to Hong Kong. \n\"A mad 24 hours,\" Poulter said on Instagram. \"Never dull in the Poulter saga.\" \nPoulter was due to arrive in Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon, meaning he will not see the golf course until it begins on Thursday. He is a past champion of the event, and in this situation, simply starting the tournament is more important than his performance. He said he would hire a local caddie for the week. \nPoulter monitors the world ranking as close as any player and did not see a scenario where he would drop five spots to No. 51. \n\"You could say poor play and poor planning,\" he said on Instagram. \"But thanks to Rich for giving me his spot.\" \nBeem, who also works as an analyst for Sky Sports, planned to join the European Tour Productions commentary team for the Hong Kong Open. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:12:50.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
