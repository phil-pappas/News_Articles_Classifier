President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, in office since June 2014, has staked his legitimacy on stabilizing the country and reviving the economy.\nYears of unrest have taken a heavy toll on Egypt's vital tourism sector and its investment climate. El-Sisi's government has launched a number of mega-projects to attract investment but they could take years to get off the ground. Meanwhile, analysts say concerns about a virtually inevitable devaluation are dampening interest.\n\"Everyone is expecting a devaluation, and since the expectation is there but it's not materializing, then investment will not come until after the devaluation takes place,\" said Amr Elalfy, global head of research at Mubasher Financial Services.\nAt the same time, the central bank has \"social factors\" to consider, he said. \"Devaluing the pound will increase costs and will increase prices.\"\nImport restrictions on consumer goods, \"if the products are selected correctly without compromising local industrial and economic activity,\" could free up some foreign currency wasted on importing non-essentials, said Farahat.\nEl-Sisi hinted at such measures during a Cabinet meeting Saturday, saying the country imports \"many unnecessary goods\" that could be provided locally, according to a statement from the president's office.\n* This story has been edited by Ahram Online", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:40:00.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
