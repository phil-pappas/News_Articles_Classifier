(By: MARK STALLINGS) (Credit: Special to the NWA Democrat-Gazette) \nComing off a victory last week of previously top-ranked Fayetteville, the Wildcats scored on three consecutive possessions in the first half and cruised from there in a 38-0 7A-West victory over the Rebels at Rowland Stadium. \n\"Any time you win on the road, it is special in the 7A-West,\" said Har-Ber Coach Chris Wood, whose Wildcats moved up to No. 1 overall in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette rankings following their victory over Fayetteville. \"We have had a lot of challenges as a program winning down here [at Southside]. We've played them a ton of times, and they always seem to be on the positive end. \n\"We were a little flat at times, but we settled down in the second half and took care of business.\" \nSouthside Coach Jeff Williams was hoping after Har-Ber's 47-43, last-second victory over Fayetteville that the Wildcats might have a letdown, but that did not happen. \n\" They obviously are one of the hottest teams in the state,\" Williams said. \"We had some chances early, but we seemed a yard away. You have to give them credit. They are a good football team.\" \nThe Wildcats (7-1, 5-0) have clinched a first-round bye for the Class 7A playoffs and can wrap up the top seed and a share of the conference title next week at home against Fort Smith Northside. \n\"Senior Night has the chance to be a really special night,\" Wood said. \"We've haven't been the top seed since 2008. I know hanging the banner for a conference championship and getting the top seed is huge in this league.\" \nHar-Ber's defense dominated the Rebels offense for most of the game, allowing 225 total yards, including just 59 yards on the ground. \n\"I thought our defense is what helped us out early in the game,\" Wood said. \"Defense really battled. They bent some but never broke.\" \nLeading 21-0 at halftime, Har-Ber's defense came up with a big stop when Austin Henderson intercepted at pass by Cooper Johnson at the Wildcats 20 to end a Rebels drive. Har-Ber drove to the Southside 17, where Jesus Zimumbo kicked a 34-yard field goal. \n\"We're struggling in the red zone right now,\" Williams said. \"We get something going but we cannot finish it up. We thought if we could get a score there to start the second half, we would still be in it. Instead, we turn it over.\" \nChandler, who threw for 225 yards and three touchdowns, tossed a 5-yard scoring pass to Trey Smith late in the third period and reserve running back Tali Nasalai added a 30-yard touchdown run early in the final quarter as Har-Ber opened up a 38-0 lead to force the running clock. \nAfter both teams traded punts on each of their first two possessions, the Wildcats offense began to assert itself behind quarterback Fuller Chandler and receiver Tyler Blackston. \nAfter a short Southside punt, Chandler hit Blackston for 19 to the Rebels 22 and two plays later Chandler rolled out right and took off for a 21-yard touchdown run with 2:32 left in the first quarter. \nA Southside punt left the Wildcats starting their next drive at their 14. Chandler hit Blackston down the left sideline, and he raced past two defenders for an 86-yard touchdown on the first play of the second quarter and a 14-0 advantage. \nHar-Ber stopped Southside again and added to its cushion, covering 79 yards in four plays. Chandler hit T.J. Eckwood for 51 yards to the Rebels 22, and two plays later hit Blackston for a 21-yard touchdown and a 21-0 lead with 8 minutes left in the first half. \nSports on 10/24/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:19:01.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
