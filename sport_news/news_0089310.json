Many will successfully harvest a deer and fill their freezer with an ample amount of “heart-healthy” venison (deer meat). \n“Venison is an excellent alternative to beef for those concerned with healthier choices in their diet,” said Paul Johansen, chief of the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources Wildlife Resources Section (DNR). “Venison is a good source of protein for many West Virginia families and has fewer calories and less fat than an equivalent serving of beef.” \nAfter the harvest, hunters can ensure their selected venison cuts will be the best quality and flavor if they take a few simple steps in caring for their game. Meat should not be exposed to excessive dirt or moisture and should be cooled as quickly as possible to avoid spoilage. \nHunters are not the only West Virginians who benefit from deer harvested in the state. \nOver the past two decades, the DNR has sponsored the Hunters Helping the Hungry (HHH) program. Since its inception in 1992, generous hunters and financial contributors have enabled the processing of this highly nutritious meat which has provided more than 1.1 million meals for needy West Virginia families. Visit www.wvdnr.gov/Hunting/HHH.shtm for information about Hunters Helping the Hungry. \nFor more information about the HHH program or West Virginia’s various deer hunting seasons and regulations, consult the 2015-2016 West Virginia Hunting and Trapping Regulations Summary available at all DNR offices and license agents or visit the DNR website at www.wvdnr.gov .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:48:38.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
