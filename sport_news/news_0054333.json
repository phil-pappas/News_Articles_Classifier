He was a very positive part of the meeting. I’ve always had a very cordial relationship with Kobe. I see him all the time in Newport (Beach), and it was really messed up that (the media) put it on him when he was one of the best parts of the meeting.\"\nBryant reportedly spoke for three minutes, and presented Aldridge with a scenario similar to how Bryant worked with Pau Gasol during their two championship runs in 2009 and 2010.\nFollowing Aldridge's meeting with the Lakers, Mike Bresnahan of the Los Angeles Times hinted that Aldridge \"didn't gel\" with Bryant. Perhaps coincidentally, Bryant took to social media shortly thereafter to critique the use of sources in the reporting process.\nMore LMA: He and Kobe didn't quite gel. It's a little vague, but Aldridge apparently didn't quite get answers from Kobe he was seeking.\n— Mike Bresnahan (@Mike_Bresnahan) July 1, 2015\nThe Lakers' inability to land a star free agent over the past two summers have led many to cast Bryant as a stumbling block. Be it Bryant's gargantuan $25-million annual salary, or the 37-year-old star hogging the spotlight, Bryant is not blameless - in the minds of many - for the Lakers' stasis over the past three seasons.\nUltimately, the allure of playing - and potentially winning - in his home state of Texas drew Aldridge to the San Antonio Spurs .\nCopyright © 2015 Score Media Ventures Inc.
