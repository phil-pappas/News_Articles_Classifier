IGNACE – Defense was on dominant display in a matchup between a pair of unbeaten and highly-ranked football teams Friday night. Ishpeming prevailed, dealing St. Ignace its first loss of the season, 20-14. Neither team could get much going with the run game on a cold night, but the Hematites found a way to get enough out of their passing game, and defense did the rest. “You have to take your hat off to Ishpeming, they don’t lose too many games,” St. Ignace coach Marty Spencer said. “We had the ball at the end, with two chances to drive down and take the lead in the fourth quarter. That’s all you can ask of your team, facing an opponent like that. “We lost the turnover battle and that was probably the difference,” Spencer said. “We turned it over three times, four times I guess counting that fake punt, and they turned it over once.\" Both teams came into the game with high rankings in the polls. St. Ignace was ranked No. 1 in the UP Little Five and No. 2 in the state Division 8 poll. Ishpeming was ranked No. 2 in the UP Big Five and No. 2 in the state Division 7 poll. Senior quarterbacks had big games for both teams. The Saints' Gage Kreski ran for 142 yards on 24 carries and scored two touchdowns. Meanwhile, Ishpeming's Ozzy Corp was 9-of-14 passing for 201 yards, and converted the key plays through the aerial attack. Facing a team that hasn’t lost in the regular season in three years, the Saints put the ball on the ground early — fumbling the second play of the game. The Hematites immediately made the Saints pay, driving down for a score. Isaac Olson punched in the first touchdown with a 10-yard run. The Saints turned it over again when a pass from Kreski deflected off a Saints’ receiver and Corp intercepted it. But the Saints defense buckled down and held. The Saints overcame three turnovers and got within two points by halftime. Kreski capped a scoring drive with a 1-yard run with 6:43 left in the second quarter. Ishpeming took a 8-6 lead into the half. The Hematites extended their lead with 20-6 in the third quarter, getting a 9-yard TD run from Nick Comment, and a 1-yard run from Haden Carello. Kreski scored on a 6-yard run with 11:14 left in the game. Kreski also added the 2-point conversion run, as the Saints used the swinging gate formation. The teams traded possessions before the Saints got the ball back with 4:35 left, with a chance to take the lead with a late drive. But the Saints were stopped on downs, and the Hematites ran out the clock to improve to 7-0. Page 2 of 2 - “St. Ignace is a great football team and the game could have went either way,” Ishpeming coach Jeff Olson said. “Everything we got, we had to earn. We like to run the ball, and they made it tough. They’re fast and they were getting off blocks, and making it difficult for us. “Fortunately we have a quarterback like Ozzy Corp, who put some throws on the money,” Olson said. “They were putting a lot of guys on the line of scrimmage on put pressure on Ozzy. But he made some very poised throws.” The Saints ran the ball 35 times for 221 yards. Mitchell Peterson added 54 yards on five carries and Andrew Goldthorpe had 18 yards on three attempts. Kreski was 5-of-13 passing for 62 yards. The Saints limited the Hematites to 123 yards rushing. Kreski led the Saints with 11 tackles, while Jared Helms had 10. Cole Garon, Luke Riordan and Mitch Peterson made eight stops each. “I think we showed we’re not too bad,” Spencer said. “Our kids played Ishpeming very tough. Hopefully we can take this and build on it, and we go down to Fowler to finish with a win.” St. Ignace (7-1) closes the regular season at Fowler this upcoming Friday. It was the first home game for the Saints since the tragic death of lineman Mitchell Snyder. A moment of silence was held before the game in Snyder’s honor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:15:07.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
