Parrish \nDemocrat Editor \nAlthough it is the second year of the cycle, Booneville and Danville met in junior high football for the first time Thursday night in Booneville. \nThat is because last year’s game was postponed due to weather and although it was rescheduled for later in the season, once it became apparent that the game would have no bearing on the conference race, it was again postponed. \nThis year the weather was near perfect and both teams were undefeated, until the teams actually played Thursday night. Then, the Bearcats (5-0, 3-0 Conference 3A-4) got 92 yards and two touchdowns from quarterback Brandon Ulmer to beat the Little Johns (4-1, 2-1) 27-6. \nIt was 6-0 after Jeremy Elliott went 37 yards for a touchdown and, following a fumble, 14-0 after Ulmer’s first score. \nThe quarterback’s second touchdown came on a run of 21 yards and made it 21-0. \nDanville scored on their opening possession of the second half on a 3-yard Trent Cathey run but Marcus Nichols’ 4-yard scoring run made it 27-6 with 7:07 to play. \nSeventh Grade Bearcats 30 Danville 8 \nColton Ritchie ran for 119 yards and two touchdowns and caught one pass for 63 yards and another score in a 30-8 win by the seventh grade Bearcats (4-1). \nJacob Herrera ran for three two point conversions and Blake Jones also scored a touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:28:44.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
