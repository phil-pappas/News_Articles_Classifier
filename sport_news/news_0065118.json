Mets, Royals have what our team needs Michael Silverman Sunday, October 25, 2015 comments Tweet KANSAS CITY — I know, I know.\nIt’s the Jets, not the Mets, who are on your mind today, New England sports fans.\nBut by dinnertime, the Patriots are going to hold a 6-0 record, and you’ll be looking for your next sports fix.\nAnd you’ll remember that the baseball season is not quite done yet, and that the Mets are playing the Royals in the World Series, and you’ll wonder: “What does this have to do with me?” And, “How is this Series relevant to the Red Sox?”\nI solemnly vow that this World Series, even though it features a team from hated New York and a godforsaken city from somewhere west of the Mississippi, will be worth your while.\nHere are three reasons to tune in:\n•      1. Be jealous, very jealous, of the Mets rotation.\nThey’re young, they throw hard and they’re really, really good. The trio of Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard is everything the Red Sox are not when it comes to having a dangerous rotation. In this, the Red Sox are not alone. No other team in baseball is set up like the Mets when it comes to having a trio like these guys, which makes them outliers but very effective outliers at that. They shut down the Dodgers offense and then the even-better Cubs lineup in an NLCS sweep with an arsenal that features 95-mph-plus fastballs from all three guys. This will pose the stiffest challenge for the Royals hitters, none of whom has familiarity with any of the three. But a distinguishing feature of this Royals lineup is that it makes a lot of contact, does not strikeout and is the best at hitting 95-mph pitching, according to statistics dug up by Yahoo Sports.\nAnother factor to consider is that there are whispers the Mets will listen this offseason to trade offers for one of their three starters, with Harvey’s name mentioned the most frequently. Harvey’s from Connecticut, a New Englander. He’ll pitch Game 1. Is it possible he’ll be in the Red Sox rotation next season? Let’s just say it’s not impossible and leave it for now.\n•     2. Be jealous, very jealous, of the Royals bullpen .\nThere was a meme going around yesterday about how Royals closer Wade Davis allowed a baserunner to third base Friday night just to see what it felt like it. That’s a pretty good indication of how devastatingly effective the Royals bullpen is overall. Including their playoff run last year (which ended in Game 7 of the World Series) and their 11 games this postseason, the bullpen has not lost a game in which the Royals were leading after six innings. Think about that. Even though Ryan Madson allowed Jose Bautista to tie up the game in the eighth Friday, Davis came in to calm things down. It wasn’t easy. He pitched before a 45-minute rain delay and then returned after it, allowing runners to reach second and third base with no outs before retiring the next three Blue Jays to clinch the pennant.\nThe Mets have a great closer in Jeurys Familia, but the rest of their bullpen does not come close to equalling Davis, Madson, Kelvin Herrera and Luke Hochevar.\nKnowing the Yankees came close to copycatting the Royals’ power-pitching bullpen last offseason, know that the Red Sox, whose bullpen needs an almost complete overhaul, will be getting nightly reminders on how great relief groups get it done.\n•     3. Despite their lack of pitching, the Red Sox resemble the Royals enough to give fans hope.\nI won’t gloss over the vast advantage the Royals pitching staff holds on the Red Sox, but there are more similarities than differences in the way the rest of the roster is assembled. Each squad possesses a gifted defensive outfield, with the Red Sox holding strength up the middle of their infield in shortstop Xander Bogaerts and second baseman Dustin Pedroia to hold their own against Alcides Escobar and Ben Zobrist. Their corner infielders, third baseman Pablo Sandoval and first baseman (if you believe it) Hanley Ramirez, should (but do not) offer more value than Mike Moustakas and Eric Hosmer. DH Kendrys Morales does not have the pop David Ortiz has, but otherwise he’s just as good. Neither team really has much power, but they scored just about the same number of runs this season.\nThe Red Sox did not come close to contending this October. Based on how Dave Dombrowski and company go about their offseason, we will soon have a much better idea if 2016 is a different story.\nIn the meantime, before the hot-stove season ignites, sit back and enjoy the show for the next four (unlikely) to seven (likelier) games between the Mets and Royals.\nThey should offer more than enough excuses to make your World Series viewing time worthwhile.\nUntil, at least, Thursday night’s game against the Dolphins.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Pay+attention%2C+Sox+fans%21", "http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url="], "published": "2015-10-25T13:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:26:03.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
