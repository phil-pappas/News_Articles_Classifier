Fournette is Ron Dayne size with Gale Sayers speed. Leonard Fournette is much more than the perfect combination of speed and power. He’s beyond being a “brick shithouse.” He makes brick shithouses look like Paul Blart Mall Cop. So why can’t he leave for the NFL next year? Invoke the Doogie Howser M.D. rule. The famous title character of a 1980s television series was a boy genius who completed his schooling and medical schooling at an early age. There was no age restriction keeping Howser from earning a living. You just had to complete the training and education to become qualified. Leonard Fournette is football Doogie Howser M.D. As we predicted back in January, Fournette will run away with the Heisman this year. He does not need to return to Baton Rouge for another year. He does not need to go anywhere next summer other than the place that will give him millions of dollars in exchange for plying his trade. There is no other side to this argument. This is Jadeveon Clowney all over again. Hey, NFL, set Leonard Fournette free.
