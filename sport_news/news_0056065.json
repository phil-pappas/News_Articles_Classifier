Everybody helped get us here and we’re excited to take on Ridge next week,” said Mazich, whose team will face the top-seeded Red Devils in next Saturday’s semifinals. “We always expect a good match from Pingry, but every game in our conference (and county) is going to be tough, so we have to go out there and fight until the end.” \nHillsborough grabbed the momentum early. After withstanding a great run by Pingry freshman Natalia Ramirez on the game’s first possession, the Raiders charged back down the field, with Baron giving Boro the lead in the sixth minute, beating a defender on the ball inside the 18 and knocking it into the right corner. \nWith a lead in their pocket, the rest was almost routine for a team that has been one of the area’s stingiest defenders \n“Pingry came out real strong, real feisty, and put a lot of pressure on the ball, and it took us a little bit to kind of counter that with our possession,” said Hillsborough coach Lee Ann Best, whose club beat Pingry 2-0 in a regular-season game earlier this year. “But just to get a hustle goal is always nice. So, definitely, starting early put a little more wind in our sails.” Girls Soccer Roundup for Saturday, Oct. 17 \nMazich got into the act with just under nine minutes left in the opening half. And while it was Alison Cichon who picked up the assist as Mazich finished the 2-on-1, it was the Raiders keeper that sparked the play \nWith Pingry pressuring the Hillsborough defense looking for an equalizer, freshman keeper Olivia Bandola came up with a huge save, leaping to knock a scorcher up and over the crossbar to deny the Big Blue, and her teammates made the most of their ensuing trip down the pitch. \n“That was huge, for me, because I’ve always been a coach who loves a quick counter,” Best said. “No matter how good a team is, that’s a good way to catch them, because you can get numbers up and go down and quickly snap it. Olivia in goal has been great this season. Everytime out there she’s been better and better, and to see her have the confidence to go up and push that ball over the (crossbar) is huge.” \nMazich added her team’s third goal with 13:23 remaining in the second half, dribbling in with a defender on her hip and snapping one far corner. \nFor Pingry, which hasn’t had it come as easy as it has over the past decade and a half, this season remains a work in progress, with plenty of talent, as usual, but putting it all together has been a challenge. Overall, it’s a young team, one that fell to an un-Pingry-like 7-7 following Saturday’s setback. \nThe Big Blue hadn’t lost more than four games in any of the past 15 seasons with Andrew Egginton at the coaching helm -- outside of last year’s 13-8 finish, one that still netted them a county title. Of course, with two more weeks of regular-season action still to come, and then the state tournament, there’s still plenty of time for Pingry to get its campaign headed in the right direction. \n“We just need to find some consistency,” said Egginton, whose team got five saves from keeper Charlotte Curnin on Saturday. “We’re a nice little soccer team, but we’ve lacked the consistency at times. We’ll put ourselves behind the 8-ball, and then we’ll rally for a period, but we need to find an 80-minute game. We haven’t done that yet.” \nStaff writer Simeon Pincus can be reached at CNGirlsSoccer@aol.com and on Twitter @SimeonPincus 2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1ROEF6b TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:02:40.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
