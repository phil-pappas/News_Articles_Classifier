The opening day of the 2015-16 track and field season could not be held there last Saturday due to an over watering problem. \nCanterbury athletics officials are annoyed they had to cancel last Saturday's opening day meeting at Rawhiti Domain after over watering by the Christchurch City Council. \nAndrew Stark, chairman of Athletics Canterbury's track and field committee, said the postponement was just a further frustration for a sport entering its fifth season at the grass track venue after the 2011 earthquake destroyed QEII Stadium. \n\"Athletics must be the only sport in Canterbury forced to compete using facilities that date back to pre-1974 when the all-weather track at QEII was completed,\" Stark said. \nHe said the over watering was a result of a \"lack of communication between council staff\". \nDespite repeated requests since last Monday from an Athletics Canterbury representative to have the automatic watering system turned off so the track could dry out, it took until Thursday afternoon before this happened, Stark said. \n\"By this time the track had been watered twice a day and it was too late for the track to dry out. For health and safety reasons and to protect the track surface from significant damage, [the children's and senior] meetings were cancelled. \n\"Since late July, we have been trying to deal with the appropriate Christchurch City Council staff responsible for overseeing the preparation and maintenance of green spaces within the city to get Rawhiti Domain ready for the new season ahead. We are completely at their mercy. We were assured that getting the track ready was a top priority, however that does not appear to be the case\". \nStark said arranging meetings with the council had proved difficult and there had been a lack of communication \"despite constant emails from Athletics Canterbury\".Finally in mid-September, following another on-site meeting at Rawhiti Domain, repair work and preparation of the track was started, he said. \n\"Again, Athletics Canterbury was assured everything would be done to get it ready in time and it 'was top priority'. Ad Feedback \n\"Why has this problem arisen? Changes to the contracts as to who looks after the green spaces within Canterbury will be the reason the council says it happened, as the new system 'settles' down. \n\"Quite frankly, that's not good enough. I doubt if other sports such as cricket have been affected the same way. How hard is it for one person to take responsibility for one park in Christchurch? Why did no-one from CCC walk around the track as it was pretty obvious it was too wet? Why did CCC not take it seriously when the watering issue was pointed out to them last Monday? \nStark said participation numbers had declined at senior interclub track and field meetings since the loss of an all-weather track. \n\"Maybe numbers will increase again when the new sports hub at Nga Puna Wai is built [but] when will that be? The three representatives from Athletics Canterbury involved in the Nga Puna Wai 'planning' are finding the same issues arising ... limited feedback and constant delays re: the time-line for what is planned to a happen and when. It's all very frustrating!! \nStark said he was hoping for \"a dry and windy week so Rawhiti Domain will be okay for next Saturday\". \nChristchurch City Council Unit Parks manager Andrew Rutledge said the council first became aware of a request to turn the water off on Tuesday and informed their contractor to shut down the irrigation system overnight. \n\"The system failed to shut down and a further request was placed with the contractor to shut the system down the following night. The contractor responded again and shut the system off,\" Rutledge said. \n\"We are currently investigating why the system failed to shut down on the initial attempt.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:38:06.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
