He completed three of four passes for 31 yards in the 45-16 loss to Samford University on Sept. 3. \nThe Bears offense rolled with Reed under center, leading 18-0 in the first quarter, but the offense didn’t miss a beat with Hildebrand in. \nFor the game, Hildebrand completed 12 of 16 passes for 201 yards and three touchdowns, which are all career highs. \nOffensive coordinator Nathan Brown said Hildebrand was going to get decent playing time this season even if Reed was healthy. \nBrown believes UCA is just as good with Hildebrand taking snaps. \n“Hayden’s the exact mold of a quarterback you look for in this offense,” he said. “He’s able to extend plays, and he’s able to run when we need him to, but he’s got a tremendous arm and his fundamentals are really spectacular. He’s everything you’re looking for in a quarterback.” \nBrown also said with Hildebrand getting experience now, it will help set up success for the program in the future. \nIt was a special situation for Hildebrand because he grew up in Bossier City, Louisiana, which is about an hour from Natchitoches, where Saturday’s game was played. \n“It’s always exciting,” Hildebrand said. “That’s the one game a year I will have most of my family members at and a lot of my friends at the game. Anytime I get to play in front of them is always special whether we win or lose. The win makes it even sweeter.” \nHildebrand came to UCA from Bossier City and redshirted as freshman in 2013. \nBecause of injuries last year, Hildebrand saw some action and completed 12 of 19 passes for 138 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. He also rushed seven times for 16 yards. \nSaturday’s game against Abilene Chrisitan will be the second SLC game for each team and will be the second time Hildebrand saw limited action against ACU. \nIn last year’s 52-35 loss in Abilene, Texas, Hildebrand completed two of four passes for 4 yards and one interception. \n“Any little bit I could get in, definitely is used to help me,” Hildebrand said. “That little game experience helps you feel more comfortable going into the season.” \nWhile the Bears are coming off a strong win over the Demons, the Wildcats defeated conference foe Stephen F. Austin State University 35-32 in a contest that came down to the final quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:15:21.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
