Booker had been limited by a left shoulder injury suffered in early August. By Ben Felderstein The Capital-Journal \nOne thing Kansas football coach David Beaty has preached since the beginning of his time at KU has been, “Earn it.” Beaty has been saying it since Day 1, and if a player works hard and does what he needs to do, the coach has said he will play. \nAccording to teammates Kent Taylor and Jordan Shelley-Smith, 6-foot-2 freshman Jeremiah Booker has been “earning it” since he arrived at camp. Beaty says the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of Booker is his work ethic. \nBooker made his season debut against Baylor, hauling in three catches for 39 yards including a 22-yard catch on third down to keep KU’s lone scoring drive alive. \n“He approaches the game like a pro does,” Beaty said. “I was looking at him yesterday, and he’s obviously — he’s a big dude already, but he’s got some growing left to do.” \nBeaty compared Booker to Iowa State’s Allen Lazard, who Beaty recruited during his time at Texas A&M. Lazard caught six balls for 75 yards and a score against KU earlier this season. \nBooker has a certain aggressiveness at the receiver position that not all freshmen possess. When a pass goes up, Booker attacks it while it’s in the air and uses his hand strength to beat the defender. \n“You can teach it,” Beaty said. “We say all the time the only way to get better at catching the ball in any different area is to do it a lot. It’s muscle memory.” \nOffensive coordinator Rob Likens said that before Booker’s left shoulder injury injury suffered in early August, he and Beaty saw him as an immediate contributor. Booker is one of five true freshmen receivers KU has on its roster who have combined for 16 catches. \n“You look out there one time and I think we had five true freshmen on offense at once,” Likens said. “(Booker) is always where he’s supposed to be. Sometimes freshmen are a little squirrelly.” \nTaylor said it came as no surprise that Booker made an impact when he stepped on the field. He described Booker’s attitude as quiet and said he is a player who is “keeping his nose to the grindstone.” \nThat type of attitude fits perfectly into Beaty’s “earn it” philosophy. Beaty said this can be an exciting time for a freshman like Booker. \nBeaty described Booker as having big eyes when he came to the sideline after his first catch Saturday. Beaty reminded him that it was the first catch of his career, and Booker said, “I’m ready to go now.” \nBeaty thinks Booker will have a bright future because of his size and determination. His body might change throughout his time at KU, but Beaty believes one thing that won’t change is his work ethic. \n“When I think of him, I think of a guy that is a tireless worker,” Beaty said. “He takes care of his body in the training room and the weight room. Everybody that has really been around him has talked about him being a pro.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:40:26.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
