They don't have to worry about, years gone by where Urban (Meyer) was here or the great team they had in 2008, they don't have to worry about people trying to accept them,\" Davis said. \"They're in the Pac-12. Just win your games; that's all you really have to do. I'm not saying that necessarily guarantees you a spot, a lot will depend on their record, but it definitely put them in better stead otherwise. \n\"You don't have to prove that your schedule was the same as somebody else's, you don't have to prove that you had the same test. You do, because you're in the Pac-12. It's another step toward winning a conference championship,\" he added. \"This game is important, but I don't think it's a landmark game where people are going to flip the switch and say, 'OK, that's a playoff team,' because they have a ton left to navigate, win or lose. Everybody else has lost in the division, so if Utah loses it won't be over. It's important, it's a big deal, but it's not a be-all (and) end-all, not at this point in the season, not in this league.\" \nSaturday's matchup features one of the best college quarterbacks in Cal's Jared Goff, who is seen as one of the top prospects in next year's NFL draft. His ability to make plays with his arm despite the opposing teams keying in on the team's pass-heavy offense has not slowed him down, even against traditionally defensive-minded teams. \n\"Of course Jared wants to have some run threat because it opens up your play-action and it kind of relaxes those safeties a little bit back there because they've got to come down and contribute,\" ESPN quarterback analyst George Whitfield said. \"But I think this is one of the rare offenses and one of those rare kids. He can succeed even when they're going to be throwing it all day and they can still have success.\" \n\nBut Whitfield said Utah's Travis Wilson, too, has NFL potential and is playing \"high-level\" football and deserves to have a lot of attention surrounding him as well. \n\"Travis is definitely in the mix there, too, in terms of the NFL,\" Whitfield said. \"He's dictating terms, he's throwing with a lot of anticipation. ... He's got a big frame, he's physical — you know how tough he is. You can't underestimate how much teams want a tough quarterback. \n\"Toughness doesn't mean flexing or running a man over, it just means you got hit by a bus, you found your way onto your feet and you're right back in the huddle and you're right back pressing the action again,\" Whitfield added. \"He certainly has that. I think he has everything you want in a quarterback at both levels.\" \nWhitfield said he's been impressed with the maturity of Wilson this year and his ability to \"manipulate\" opposing defenses. After watching film, Whitfield said Wilson does a great job of leading a corner along with his eyes, but flipping the script to make a big play with one of his receivers. \n\"Him and coach Roderick have seemed to really hit on a nice stride together. He's doing some things that are advanced — high-level things where he is manipulating defenders as opposed to reading them,\" Whitfield said. \"He's dictating the terms now, and that's another big step, that's a huge step; that's what scouts starts to look for as an NFL quarterback, coaches look for. \n\"He's able to now dictate terms — that is an advanced level of play,\" he added. \"If he can do it against Oregon, it's in his DNA going forward. This is going to be a juggernaut for the duration.\" \nESPN's \"College GameDay\" will begin Saturday at 7 a.m. for its 3-hour broadcast. Fans of all teams are encouraged to attend anytime during the broadcast. Later that night, at 8 p.m., No. 5 Utah and No. 23 Cal are set to kickoff in a Pac-12 showdown on ESPN, pitting the current South division leader against the current North division leader as the only remaining undefeated teams in the Pac-12.
