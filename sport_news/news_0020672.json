Porn in full color and high definition is now widely available over the Internet.\n\"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just pass√© at this juncture,\" Playboy Enterprises CEO Scott Flanders told The New York Times.\nThe change represents a major shift for the magazine, which broke new ground when Hugh Hefner created it and featured Marilyn Monroe on its debut cover in 1953. It marks the latest step away from depictions of full nudity, which were banned from the magazine's website in August 2014.\nThe magazine claims it website audience soared with that move, averaging a 400 percent increase in monthly unique visitors.\n\"The political and sexual climate of 1953 ... bears almost no resemblance to today,\" Flanders said. \"We are more free to express ourselves politically, sexually and culturally today, and that's in large part thanks to Hef's heroic mission to expand those freedoms.\"\nPlayboy editor Cory Jones recently contacted Hefner about dropping nude photos from the print edition and he agreed, the Times reported.\nPlayboy's print circulation, once measured in millions, is now about 800,000, according to Alliance for Audited Media, the newspaper reported.\nThe shift from nudity will be accompanied by other changes in the magazine, including a slightly larger size and a heavier, higher quality of paper meant to give the magazine a more collectible feel.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
