But the South Africans managed to pull one back through substitute Kermit Erasmus in the 58 th minute.\nThe 2-1 scoreline brought Ahly back to square one, as all they needed now was to score a single goal to go through, but it was the visitors who netted a second through Thamsanqa Gabuza in the 75th minute to make Ahly's mission more difficult.\nOrlando, however, did not rest on their laurels with their opponents needing to score two goals to progress, as Thabo Matlaba compounded Ahly's woes with another goal with just four minutes remaining.\nSubstitute Amr Gamal then equalized to make it 3-3 in the second minute of stoppage time, before another sub in Thabo Rakale made sure the Buccaneers emerged winners in both legs in the final minute.\nAhly now squandered their last chance to save their faltering season, after losing the domestic league and cup titles to arch-rivals Zamalek.\nOrlando Pirates and Etoile du Sahel, who edged out Zamalek with a 5-4 aggregate win, now meet in the competition's two-legged final in November.\nAhly shambolic defending\nIn a largely dreary affair, Evouna finally managed to open the scoring three minutes from half-time when he latched onto a Abdallah El-Saied lofted through ball to break clear and brilliantly round the keeper before slotting home.\nEvouna, who joined Ahly in the summer for a hefty fee in the region of $2.5million, then made it two after the break when he headed past the keeper Moemen Zakareya's cross from the right just eight minutes into the second half.\nAhly, however, were pegged back by Erasmus who struck a brilliant volley from inside the area that beat keeper Sherif Ekramy at the far post.\nAnd it wasn't the end of Orlando Pirates' goals though, with Gabouza allowed to make his way through the Ahly defense unopposed before seeing his strike hit a defender and fly into the net to make it 2-2.\nWith Ahly in dire need to score two goals, a blunder from Sherif Ekrami was the last thing they ever wished for, with the keeper seeing his pass to Mohamed Naguib intercepted by Matlaba who eventually evaded the latter's challenge and slid home.\nGamal then scored the goal that could have basically spared Ahly's blushes when he pounced on a loose ball to strike from inside the area for his side's third of the night two minutes into stoppage time.\nBut another horrendous defending from the reigning champions' backline allowed their opponents to emerge winners, when an unmarked Rakale was allowed to exploit the space between the Egyptians' center backs to net his side' fourth to make it a 5-3 aggregate win.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:16:22.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
