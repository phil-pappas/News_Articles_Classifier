He was 69. \nEverton said Kendall died in hospital in Southport, northwestern England, on Saturday. \nKendall first took charge of Everton from 1981-87, winning the English league title and the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1985, and the league again in 1987. It was the most successful period in the club’s history. \nHe also managed Everton from 1990-93 and for the 1997-98 season, having previously spent seven years of his playing career at the club. \nEverton said Kendall was “the most successful manager in the history of the club and one of the greatest players to pull on the Everton jersey.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:21:11.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
