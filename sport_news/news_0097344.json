Posted: Sunday, October 4, 2015 1:00 am Is Luck good to go? \nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Andrew Luck has a knack for overcoming obstacles. \nHe made the transition from Peyton Manning look seamless. He made the low rookie expectations look ridiculous. He turned doubters into believers, and in less than four seasons Luck has seen his stock soar. \nNow he's about to face a new challenge. For the first time in his pro career, Luck is dealing with questions about a sore right arm and whether his health will allow him to continue bailing out the Colts. He is considered a game-time decision for today's game against Jacksonville. \nHe was listed as questionable Friday after he was limited in practice for the third straight day with a sore right shoulder. Coach Chuck Pagano gave no indication to the extent of Luck's participation or how much Luck has thrown this week. \nClearly, Luck has not been himself this season. He's thrown seven interceptions and his 30 turnovers over the past 19 regular-season games are both league highs. \nBut, somehow, Luck always seems to find a way to rally the team. \nLast week, it was a fourth-quarter comeback at Tennessee — perhaps after he got hurt — that saved Indy's season and created a four-way tie atop the AFC South. Today, Luck intends to break the logjam by beating up on division foes again. \n\"When you're playing a divisional opponent, when you're playing the Colts who you know have won 13 straight division games in a row, you want to be able to go out and perform well,\" Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles said. \nActually, it's 14 in a row, a number that has put the Colts (1-2) on the cusp of history. \nFrom 1972-73, Miami won an NFL record 15 consecutive games against opponents in its own division, according to STATS. Since realignment in 2002, Luck and Manning share the distinction as being the only quarterbacks to win 14 consecutive games against one division. \nTo keep the streak alive, it's going to take the whole team to help Luck stand tall and stay healthy. \n\"I know with their record some would say the Colts are struggling,\" Jags coach Gus Bradley. \"It looked like they really started to pick it up in that Tennessee game. Just watching that tape, especially last week, they're still a very, very impressive team.\" \nHere are some other things to watch today: GROUND GAME \nOne way to protect Luck would be featuring running back Frank Gore. He's coming off his best performance with the Colts — 14 carries, 86 yards, two TDs. But it's unclear who Gore would share the workload with. The only other running backs with carries this season, Josh Robinson and Tyler Varga, are also battling injuries. Jacksonville has only allowed one 100-yard rusher in its last 15 road games. WAKE-UP CALL \nA week ago, the Jaguars defense gave up 51 points and allowed New England to score on each of its first nine possessions. That must be dramatically better this week against an offense that is struggling and a quarterback who is hurting. ANDRE THE SHRINKING GIANT \nColts receiver Andre Johnson was supposed to give Indy's offense a boost. So far, he has seven receptions for 51 yards, a 7.3-yard average, and no TDs. Last week, for the first time in a decade, Johnson was shut out. Don't be surprised if the Colts make a concerted effort to get Johnson more involved this week.
