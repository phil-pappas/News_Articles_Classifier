San Diego kicker Jack Flatau had made field goals of 49 and 32 yards. \nDayton (5-0, 2-0) was without Connor Kacsor — who came into the game leading the FCS in rushing (151.5 yards per game). The Flyers had just 57 total yards and trailed 9-3 at halftime. \nThe Flyers racked up 173 yards in the third, including a 55-yard touchdown pass from Alex Jeske to Tucker Yinger that gave Dayton the lead for good. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:54:38.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
