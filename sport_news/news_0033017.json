He was ruled out, the team announced Saturday. Bryant didn't participate in practice all week and was originally listed as doubtful.\nA Cowboys spokesman said the star receiver didn't make the trip with the team to the New York area on Friday so he could rest.\nBryant has been sidelined since Dallas' season opener after fracturing the fifth metatarsal bone in his right foot during a Week 1 victory over the Giants.\nHe underwent surgery shortly after the injury occurred and this month received a therapeutic injection of stem cells and platelets into the damaged area to promote healing. Last week, Bryant returned to the field for rehabilitation work as the team practiced.\nComing off the team's bye over the Oct. 18 weekend, the Cowboys sold the idea that Bryant could possibly play against the Giants. Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said the team would evaluate Bryant up until the start of the game. Offensive coordinator Scott Linehan, meanwhile, hinted that Bryant could be used in a reduced capacity.\n\"We wouldn't have any qualms if we have the opportunity to play him, even limited,\" Linehan said. \"We just get updates each day and see how close he can get. If it's the Giants, it's the Giants. Otherwise we move on. We're staying patient with him and we're very encouraged with his progress.\"\nBut it always seemed far-fetched Bryant would return to action this Sunday.\nAfter all, he didn't participate in organized team activities during his contract standoff with the Cowboys and didn't appear in any preseason games because of a lingering hamstring injury. To make Bryant's situation more challenging, the Cowboys are debuting a new starting quarterback, Matt Cassel, who has yet to practice with the receiver since being acquired in a trade Sept. 22.\n\"He's very functional in life right now,\" Garrett said of Bryant. \"What we're trying to see is if he's functional on the field.\"\nThey decided it was best to wait a little longer to find out.\nOn Twitter:\n @RainerSabinDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RainerSabinDMN"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:28:30.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
