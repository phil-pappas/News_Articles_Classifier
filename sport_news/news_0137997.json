The Lions' 24-game skid is the longest in Division I. \nSuccess has come with far more regularity for Wagner, which shared the Northeast Conference title last season and won nine games in 2012. Those seasons, however, came under legend Walt Hameline, who stepped down following 34 years at the helm and was replaced by offensive coordinator Jason Houghtaling in November. \nThe Seahawks are 0-4 for the first time since opening 0-4-1 in 1956. They haven't started a season with five consecutive defeats since the previous year, when they lost all seven games. \nBoth teams have struggled to generate consistent offense and rank as two of the lowest-scoring teams in the FCS. \nThe Lions are 111th out of 125 teams with 15.0 points per game, while the Seahawks (15.5) are only slightly better. \nThose weak offenses were on display last weekend. \nWagner enjoyed a rare lead, using a pair of field goals for a 6-3 halftime edge against Robert Morris on Saturday only to go scoreless in the second half and lose 9-6 on a last-minute field goal. \nMatthias McKinnon was a bright spot, rushing for a career-high 139 yards on 22 carries. That wasn't nearly enough to compensate for a poor performance from sophomore Alex Thomson , who completed 6 of 14 passes for 45 yards while getting sacked seven times. \n\"We've just got to get better, we have to execute,\" Houghtaling said. \"We ran the ball well this week, we threw it well last week. We just have to put everything together.\" \nThomson's game was disappointing after he completed 15 of 23 for 219 yards with a pair of touchdowns the previous week against Lafayette. \n\"We didn't get as good a play out of the quarterback position,\" Houghtaling said. \"That's on me, nobody else. I have to do a better job coaching the quarterback position.\" \nWhile it has yet to result in a victory, the Lions have made progress since a season-opening 20-point loss to Fordham. \nThey followed that with a 24-16 defeat to Georgetown and nearly overcame four turnovers in last Saturday's 10-5 loss at Princeton in a game played in a driving rainstorm. \nColumbia remained winless since Nov. 10, 2012. \n\"I feel incredibly bad for our kids, just because of the effort that they put forth and they deserve better than this,\" coach Al Bagnoli said. \"We're showing improvement but we don't have a heck of a lot to show for it in the won-loss record.\" \nAnother quarterback looking to bounce back is Skyler Mornhinweg , who was 6 of 20 for 102 yards with three interceptions against Princeton. He entered the contest fifth in the FCS with a 69.8 completion percentage. \nThere were some positives for the Lions in their latest loss, as they held one of the top offenses in the FCS to one touchdown, nine first downs and 56 passing yards. \nThe Tigers totaled 92 points, 54 first downs and 500 yards through the air in their first two games. \nThis will be Wagner's first game against Columbia and its first meeting with an Ivy League opponent since a 31-7 loss to Cornell on Oct. 1, 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:51:01.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
