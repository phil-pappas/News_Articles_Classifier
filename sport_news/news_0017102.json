You know, when you've got a problem, there's a head coach with a door there. Go through that door and talk to the head coach. There's an offensive coordinator. And maybe he has. I'm not there.\"\nWatkins has taken his concerns to the coaching staff. According to the Buffalo News, Watkins expressed his concerns to his agent, who then talked to the Bills. Either way, Watkins' concerns, which are warranted, have become public.\nHis desire to be targeted 10 times per game might not be realistic in this offense. In Rex Ryan's six years with the New York Jets, only three players were targeted more than 100 times in a single season, and no player was targeted more than 115 times.\n\"Forget the 12 targets a game in this offense,\" Golic said. \"Not gonna happen. Not gonna happen. Tyrod Taylor, that's not gonna happen with him as a quarterback. It wouldn't happen with EJ Manuel as a quarterback. And it's not gonna happen in this offense, with this head coach, with the type of defense they have. So if he wants himself 10 targets a game — and let's start listing the players around the league that get 10 targets a game — then it's not going to be in Buffalo. ... What he wants, and where he is, does not mesh right now.\"\nWatkins has expressed time and time again throughout his first two seasons that he cares more about winning than he does getting the football. He also has mentioned how talented his teammates are and how they make him better. But he's not stupid. He knows this offense is better when he's getting the football, and so far in two seasons, he has only five games with 10 or more targets after the Bills traded up to No. 4 in the 2014 NFL Draft to take him.\n\"The point is, they traded up to get him,\" Greenberg said. \"I'm not saying he should be saying publicly what he's saying, but it's sort of putting fancy rims on a beat-up old car. It just doesn't make a lot of sense.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:21:13.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
