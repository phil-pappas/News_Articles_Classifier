He completed his hat trick on the stroke of halftime and Bony netted his second in the 89th as City maintained its two-point lead of crosstown rival Manchester United.\n(For .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:30:17.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
