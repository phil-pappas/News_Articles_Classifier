He then went down on one knee while play continued up the ice. The Sabres announced Lehner sustained a lower-body injury. \nLehner allowed one goal on 12 shots, and was replaced by Chad Johnson. \nBuffalo gave up a first-round draft pick to acquire Lehner in a trade with Ottawa in June. He was playing his first game since sustaining a season-ending concussion in a 6-3 loss to Carolina on Feb. 16. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:19:22.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
