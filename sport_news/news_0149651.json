Unioto has been nothing short of an offensive monster in recent weeks. \nThe Huntsmen were able to stack the box and effectively force the Tanks to take to the air. It was there the Huntsmen showed leaps of improvement and were able to come away with vital turnovers. \nNone of those turnovers were more important than a recovery after a Hosely fumble. That carried the momentum away from Unioto in the second half and surrendered it over to the Huntsmen. Huntington never looked back. \nEffectively holding Unioto on four downs from the 1-yard line, the Huntsmen’ defense stood up to the high powered Unioto offense and shut it down, not allowing the Tanks to score. \nThe Huntsmen were able to take every shot that Unioto would throw and throw one right back. \nUnioto’s Clay Edler threw for 242 yards and carried the ball 14 times for 35 yards and two total touchdowns. Erique Hosely had seven catches for 49 yards.
