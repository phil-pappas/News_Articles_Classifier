I felt something, but hopefully it's fine. I don't know,\" Nadal said. \n\"My schedule is go to Shanghai tomorrow and practice tomorrow afternoon. For the moment, still the same.\" \nDespite the injury, eighth-ranked Nadal was pleased to have played his first hardcourt final this year, after a season when he has dropped well off the pace set by Djokovic. \nAnd the 29-year-old said he had growing belief that he could pull off yet another comeback and return to the stage where he can mount a realistic challenge to the imperious Serb. \n\"I'm going to fight. I'm going to do it my way. When I was number two and Roger was number one, it was not my obsession to catch Roger. My obsession was to improve my game and do my way. For me is the same thing today,\" he said. \n\"My motivation is to keep going, do it my way, and I have been that way already. I know if I am playing well again, then I can fight. If I can fight, I can compete well (a number of) times in a row against the best players, then normally I was a good competitor. \n\"So I think I going to be good competitor again if I recover my level.\" \nNadal has been written off before in his career and has managed to recover, notably in 2013 when he returned from a serious knee injury and climbed back to number one in the world. \nHe had previously demonstrated his grit and determination when he doggedly tracked down and overtook Federer, the long-time world number one, in 2008. \n\"Obviously today (Djokovic) is better than me, and that's it. I hope to fight next year, seriously. I hope to fight again with the top players because I have motivation to do it and I am working very hard and well,\" Nadal said. \nHe added: \"Hopefully I'm still healthy to keep practising the way... that I am practising today. If that happens, I am really confident. I believe that I can do it again.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:21:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
