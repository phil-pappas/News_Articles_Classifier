Westhill, Stamford to field co-op boys ice hockey team this season 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nSTAMFORD — When comes to the current state of boys hockey in the city of Stamford, reality trumps history. \nThe rivalry between Stamford High School and   will be put on hold this coming season as the Black Knights and the Vikings will form a co-op team. \nThe stark roster numbers of returning players for both schools dictated the move, which was just recently approved by the CIAC. \n“That was the best solution to a tough situation,” Stamford High coach Doug Robinson said. \nWesthill had just eight returning players and Stamford had 10 returnees. Those totals made practice and playing games as single schools in one of the toughest leagues in the state nearly impossible. \nThe Stamford-Westhill co-op squad will play a normal 20-game schedule. However, due to the late hour of the decision being ratified, other FCIAC schools will be scrambling a bit to fill an empty slot in their schedules. \nThe Stamford-Westhill co-op squad has inherited Stamford’s FCIAC schedule for the upcoming season with non-league contests slotted in to get to 20 games. \nThe Stamford-Westhill squad will wear uniforms sporting the logos of both schools. The good news is both Stamford High coach Doug Robinson and Westhill coach John Santagata will remain on the staff of the Co-op squad. \nRobinson and Santagata met with the contingent of co-op players at Terry Conners rink 10 days ago with favorable reviews. \n“Doug and I coaching together will be fine,” Santagata said. “There will be a learning curve, but we’ll be fine. Our bench will have a lot of coaching experience. And most hockey systems are fairly similar.” \nAfter discussions with the CIAC, the Stamford-Westhill Co-op squad will remain in Division III for state tournament purposes. Westhill advanced to the Division III semifinals last year before losing 4-3 in overtime to Masuk. \nHowever, Westhill graduated eight seniors from that team. This season, Westhill has just one senior while Stamford has two seniors. \nThe Co-op squad will have a number of goalie candidates. The probable starting goalie could be Westhill junior Christian Compolattaro, who was so impressive in the Vikings’ Division III state playoff run. \nWhile it may take the parents on both sides a while to get used to the new reality, it shouldn’t be too hard for the players. \n“The kids know each other from playing youth hockey together,” Santagata said. “We all will put the rivalry on hold.” \nThe Co-op route has been very beneficial on the girls ice hockey side as the Stamford-Westhill-Staples program has improved each year in terms of numbers and talent level. \nAnd now, Stamford High and   boys ice hockey will continue to compete until a vast bubble of Stamford Youth Hockey players can arrive at the high school level. \nStamford High School athletic director Jim Moriarty and Westhill High athletic director Larry Savo as well as the two head coaches met with the parents of all potential players last Friday. The meeting had a positive outcome. \n“This is much better than the alternative of no boys ice hockey at either school,” Santagata said. “Nobody wanted to see the end of high school boys ice hockey at Stamford or Westhill.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:57:04.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
