(Image Source: Tom Pennington/Getty Images) \nAround the NFL in Week 3: \n* Comeback Kids: The Atlanta Falcons did it again, outscoring the Dallas Cowboys 14-0 in the fourth quarter to come out on top 39-28. Not only are they 3-0 but they are also the first team in NFL history to come from behind in the fourth quarter to win the first three games to start a season. \nWR Julio Jones is off to an amazing start. Through three games, he has 34 receptions, a league record, and he’s also the first player in NFL history with 135-plus yards in each of the first three games. On Sunday he caught 12 balls for 164 yards and two scores. \nComplementing Jones through the air was RB Devonta Freeman on the ground. The second-year back rumbled for 141 yards and three scores. They are the third tandem of a runner going over the century mark with three scores and a pass catcher with 150-plus yards and two TDs in the same game. \nThe previous two came from a pair of historically prolific offenses. RB James Brooks and WR Wes Chandler were the first duo to do it for the 1982 San Diego Chargers and they were matched by RB Marshall Falk and WR Torry Holt of the 2001 St. Louis Rams. \n* Tom Terrific: With two TD passes in Sunday’s 51-17 win over Jacksonville, QB Tom Brady (401) joined Peyton Manning (533), Brett Favre (508) and Dan Marino (420) in the 400-TD club. It was also the 31 st time in his career that Brady led the Pats to 40-plus points, an NFL record. Brady is also one of three players—Manning (2010, 2013) and Don Meredith are the other two—with at least nine TD passes to no INTs, three games into a season. \nGreen Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers joined the group on Monday night when he tossed five TD passes against Kansas City giving him 10 to no picks on the season. \n* Green With Envy: Cincinnati Bengals WR A.J. Green caught 10 passes for 227 yards and two TDs, including the game winner with 2:10 left in the team’s 28-24 win over the Baltimore Ravens. Miles Austin (2009) is the only other player in league history with at least 10 catches, 225 receiving yards, two TDs and the game-winning score in the fourth quarter or OT. His 227 yards were the second-most receiving yards in franchise history, as Chad Johnson went for 260 yards against San Diego in 2006. \n* Rookie Watch: In Cleveland, Oakland first-round pick Amari Cooper caught eight passes for 134 yards as the Raiders upset the Browns. It’s his second 100-yard game and he’s just the second rookie to have two 100-yard games through the first three games of a season, joining DeSean Jackson (2008). \nAnother rookie pass catcher has been making noise this season, however Tyler Lockett is doing most of his damage on special teams. He returned a punt 57 yards to the paint in Week 1 and on Sunday, the Kansas State product took the opening kickoff of the second half 105 yards for a score. He joins Tony Green (1978) as the second rookie to return a kickoff and a punt for a TD in the first three games of a season. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
