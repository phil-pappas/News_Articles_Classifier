BRADENTON, Fla. – St. Joseph Regional began its second half at IMG Academy Stadium with one of the drives it would need to hand IMG its first loss of the season.\nBut the drive fell short of the end zone – and SJR eventually came up shy on the scoreboard Friday night, 24-12.\nThe Green Knights started at their own 45 and ran the ball six times to move into the red zone. St. Joseph eventually settled for a field to cut the Ascenders’ lead to four.\nIMG answered with two plays. Drake Davis brought a kick return from the goal line to SJR’s 26. On the first play from scrimmage, Emmanuel Greene took an end-around into the end zone to give the Ascenders a two-possession lead.\nSt. Joseph followed with an eight-minute touchdown drive. The Green Knights found their rhythm too late against IMG’s explosive offense and left Bradenton with a loss against the top-ranked team in Florida.\n“We got off schedule a couple times and getting off schedule against a team like this kills you,” coach Augie Hoffmann said.\nSJR held the Ascenders to their lowest scoring output of the season, but was plagued by penalties and turnovers in the first half. While IMG was slogging to its worst offensive half of football this year, St. Joseph missed its chance at an upset.\nThe Green Knights ended the Ascenders’ first drive of the game by forcing Shea Patterson into his first interception of the season. The No. 1 quarterback in the nation tried a throw into the seam and after a pair of deflections Jake Trotter hauled in the first takeaway of the game. In the first half there were more turnovers (five) than scores (three).\n“We weren’t very efficient in the first half,” IMG head coach Kevin Wright said. “They’re rangy and tall. Everyone knocks balls down and got us a little out of sync.”\nThe drive that followed for SJR lasted only three plays before Joe Neglia booted away one of his three punts. St. Joseph’s next drive – after forcing a three-and-out – ended with an interception in Ascender territory.\nA second-quarter field goal by Angelo Guglielmello got the Green Knights on the board and cut IMG’s lead to 7-3. The Ascenders’ next drive ended with a field goal before SJR gave away a chance at an equalizing drive late in the first half.\nIMG’s Jango Glackin fell on a fumbled kickoff return deep in SJR territory.\n“In a game like this, turnovers … are just gonna kill you,” Hoffmann said. “You can’t afford to do it against great players. They made great plays when they had to.”\nSt. Joseph’s defense held for a turnover on downs and sent the Green Knights into halftime in a 10-3 hole. For SJR’s methodical offense it was too much to make up against the Ascenders.\nSt. Joseph’s lone touchdown drive of the game began with 7:01 left in the third quarter and ended 48 seconds into the fourth. The march lasted 17 plays and included 16 runs, including nine by running back Brian Kearns. The only throw came on the final play of the drive, when quarterback Nick Patti connected with Neglia for a 2-yard strike to cut the lead to 17-12.\nEight plays and 3:30 later, IMG was back in the end zone.\n“We accomplished what we wanted to accomplish in the second half and that was the game plan in the first half, too,” Hoffman said. “We just couldn’t get it done.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:27.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
