Both times, the award was earned based on his performance in a victory over the Eagles.\nIt might take another Herculean effort from Manning when the Giants face the Eagles on Monday night at Lincoln Financial Field.\nTo varying degrees, the Giants have come to lean on their indispensable quarterback for the better part of a decade, and the 2015 edition needs him more than ever. The running game has surfaced only in spurts, and the defense plays well until it doesn’t. \nManning throwing to the usual suspects (Odell Beckham Jr. and Rueben Randle, both dealing with hamstring issues), a new import (Shane Vereen), a talented but flawed tight end (Larry Donnell) and a bunch of others is the only aspect of the game the Giants do exceedingly well. Until help arrives, Eli’s arm must carry the Giants.\nEli’s arm, for the first time in four years, got him named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week — no surprise given his record-breaking performance in the 30-27 victory over the 49ers, a comeback he stamped as official with a touchdown pass to Donnell with 21 seconds remaining. Manning completed a franchise-record 41 passes, threw for 441 yards — the third-highest total of his career — plus three touchdowns and one interception.\nThat was at home. What happens next takes place in Philadelphia, where heroics and success are not exactly commonplace for Manning.\n“Well, you know what to expect,’’ Manning said Wednesday. “It’s going to be loud, they’re going to be fired up, prime time on Monday night, and it should be a great atmosphere. \n“We have a couple of new guys who may have been in this atmosphere last year. I think guys experienced it, so it’s good just knowing that’s it’s going to be loud and our communication has to be great. We have to be good with our snap count, everybody on the same page, and getting in and out the huddle quickly, just because it will be loud. We will get some interesting looks on defense, and we have to make sure we’re all on the same page.’’\nSince Chip Kelly arrived in 2013, the Eagles are 3-1 against the Giants, winning with Nick Foles (twice) and Mark Sanchez at quarterback and losing with Matt Barkley. For the Giants, as per usual, it’s been all Manning. Sam Bradford will be the eighth different Eagles quarterback to start against the Giants since Eli’s reign began.\n“It’s helped us immensely to be able to have that position solidified and have an outstanding player, great leader at that spot over the years to be able to count on that knowing full well that that was going to be done as well as we could do it,’’ Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. “Then we would have to deal with all the changes that have happened over the course of time around that position, but because Eli has been there as an anchor and a guy who we can always turn to. It’s been a spot that many times we’ve had to build a football team around. So thank goodness for that.’’\nManning’s statistics through the first five games are on pace for career-bests — not necessarily a good thing for the Giants. He leads the NFL with 197 pass attempts (his 131 completions are three behind league-leader Philip Rivers), proof that the offensive balance Coughlin prefers does not exist. One number, in the eyes of the Giants, is blissfully low: Manning has thrown just two interceptions. \n“I think the entire offense, all of the players have a better understanding and a better feel for this offense than we did last year,’’ Manning said. “We’re protecting the football. We’re not turning the ball over much. We’re staying in good down-and-distance. We’re getting much more positive yards. We’re not taking sacks, and we’re not having runs for negative yards. Guys are playing fast and making plays, and so we have to keep doing that.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under eli manning ,  new york giants ,  philadelphia eagles ,  tom coughlin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:31:50.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
