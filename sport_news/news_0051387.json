(AP)\nMomentum seems to be on the side of the Filipino booters after producing one of their best performances in recent memory – a scoreless draw with the group-leading North Koreans last Thursday in Pyongyang.\nBut that result will be put to waste if the Azkals fail to beat Bahrain for the second time in the qualifiers.\nThe Azkals, currently in third place with seven points, beat Bahrain, 2-1, in their first meeting last June at the Philippine Sports Stadium in Bocaue, Bulacan.\nNorth Korea (10 points) could extend its lead in Group H as it is favored to defeat winless Yemen today in Pyongyang while idle Uzbekistan sits in second at nine points following its 4-0 thrashing of Bahrain last week.\nThe top team in Group H will earn a slot in the third round of the qualifiers while securing an entry into the 2019 Asian Cup while the runner-up must secure enough points to emerge as one of the four best second placers from among the eight groups in the qualifiers.\nGoalkeeper Neil Etheridge and the defense powered by the likes of Daisuke Sato, Jerry Lucena and Amani Aguinaldo hope to limit the scoring chances of the Bahrainis and open the door for Azkals’ attacking core of Stephan Schrock, Phil Younghusband and Misagh Bahadoran.\nBahrain, meanwhile, is in dire need of a victory to stay in the hunt. The home side is in fourth place with just one victory in four matches for three points.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:43:45.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
