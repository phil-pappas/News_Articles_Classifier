Not even Clemson — from which “Clemsoning” entered the college football lexicon to describe when a heavily favored team delivers an inexplicably disappointing losing performance. \nThe Sooners can add to that ignoble tally twice more this season , as FPI gives them a 98.4 percent chance of beating Kansas on Oct. 31 and a 94.6 percent chance of beating Iowa State on Nov. 7.
