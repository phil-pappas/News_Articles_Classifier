Kate Brown believes it is up to local voters to assess Sheriff John Hanlin. \"The sheriff is an elected official accountable to the voters of Douglas County. The evaluation of his performance, past and present, is up to them,\" said spokeswoman Kristen Grainger.\nThe Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence is calling for the resignation of Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, saying his \"extremist\" views on gun rights call into question his ability to conduct a fair investigation of last week's mass shootings at Umpqua Community College.\nDan Gross, the group's president, pointed to Hanlin's 2013 letter to Vice President Joe Biden saying he wouldn't enforce gun restrictions that the sheriff regarded as unconstitutional -- as well as a video he posted the same year on Facebook suggesting that the Sandy Hook killings were staged by the federal government to build support for gun control.\n\"John Hanlin is not the man for the job,\" Gross told reporters Monday morning in a conference call. He added that people \"need to trust that nothing is being presented or withheld because of one man's extremist ideology.\"\nHanlin could not be reached for immediate comment. But he told reporters Friday that he did not believe that Sandy Hook was a government conspiracy and said that now was not the time to talk about his views on gun laws.\n\"My focus right now is on getting this investigation completed and taking care of the victims and the victims' families,\" Hanlin said. \"Now is not an appropriate time to have those conversations.\"\nHanlin has conducted several nationally televised press conferences since the shooting deaths of 10 people, including the killer. He also attracted headlines for refusing to name the shooter, saying he didn't want to give him the attention he believed he was seeking.\nHanlin testified against the bill that passed earlier this year expanding background checks to cover private gun transfers. The sheriff told legislators that the law was \"nearly impossible\" to enforce and cited his office's tight budget constraints.\nThe Brady Campaign is named for Jim Brady -- the press secretary to President Ronald Reagan who was seriously wounded in a 1981 shooting -- and his wife Sarah. The two helped lobby for passage of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 , which mandated background checks nationally on gun purchases.\n--Jeff Mapes\njmapes@oregonian.com\n503-221-8209\n@Jeffmapes", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act", "http://www.bradycampaign.org/"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:33:48.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
