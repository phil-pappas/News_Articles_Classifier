Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. In week five, the Calaveras Redskins hosted Bret Harte at Frank Meyer Field and the Bullfrogs had one person in the Calaveras offense that they knew they had to stop — receiver Trevor Ramirez. Bret Harte did exactly what it wanted, Ramirez went without a reception. However, the ‘Frogs were gigged by Shane Torre, a 6-foot-3, 235-pound tight end, who had 163 receiving yards and a touchdown in the 36-8 Redskin win. Torre followed his outstanding performance against Bret Harte with a two touchdown night last week against Sonora. He has found the end zone in four straight games after not being a factor in the ‘Skins first two games of the season. In the first two games of the season, Torre had two receptions for eight yards and no scores. Coincidentally, the ‘Skins were 0-2. Since Torre became more of a presence in the offense, Calaveras is 3-1 with the one loss being a heartbreaking 28-27 defeat to Sonora. “It was hard the first few weeks because it’s my senior season and I want to get a college scholarship,” Torre said Wednesday night after practice. “Now the passes are starting to come and it’s nice to know that all the work I put in this year is starting to pay off.” Calaveras head coach Jason Weatherby knew he had one of the most dangerous weapons in the Mother Lode League, and he had every intention of putting the ball in Torre’s hands. The lack of early season production was not because they were not trying to get him involved in the passing game. “Sometimes things just fall into place to where you can use him more,” Weatherby said. “I felt like at the beginning of the season we were trying to get him involved, but were not able to do so. It took a couple of games to even get a catch out of him.” In six games, Torre has 311 receiving yards and five touchdowns. He has quickly become one of quarterback Dylan Byrd’s favorite targets. As the season moves along, the two are becoming more compatible on the field. “It’s all about consistency,” Byrd said. “I think that is a big part that sets Shane apart from other receivers. You throw him the ball and he’s going to make a play and he’s been doing it all year for us.” “I think that just going through the season, Dylan’s (Byrd) confidence level has been raised to a point to where he feels more comfortable throwing the ball to me more and that pushes the passing game along a lot farther,” Torre said. Torre is also the hammer on the ‘Skins defense. He has 30 tackles, 14 of which are solo. He has one quarterback sack and when he gets his hands on a ball-carrier, there is no escape. “We call him Shrek because he’s built like a specimen,” teammate Caleb Hodgson said. “He’s always been that way. This year he’s been using his size as an advantage. He’s a pretty sure tackler and when he gets his hands on you, you are not going anywhere. He’s going to pick you up and swing you around. It’s pretty tough to break one of his tackles.” Tonight, when Argonaut visits Frank Meyer Field, Torre will not line up at linebacker or defensive end. Instead, his hand will be in the dirt, playing defensive tackle along side Cameron Moore. Argonaut is pass happy, so the ‘Skins are looking at the combination of Moore and Torre to put constant pressure on the quarterback. A challenge both are happy to accept. “It’s nice knowing that I’ve got a guy next to me that can break through any offensive line and get to the quarterback,” Moore said. “It’s pretty exciting.” Though Torre excels on both sides of the ball, he prefers playing offense and being able to make big plays. “I enjoy offense a little more than defense because I love the feeling of having the ball in my hands and having an opportunity to make a play and change the game,” Torre said. Calaveras (3-3, 1-1 MLL) needs a win at home tonight to keep its hands on second place in the MLL. Argonaut (2-3, 1-1) is coming off a bye week. The last time Argonaut played was in a 28-26 home overtime loss to Sonora. “This game is pretty huge because since the loss to Sonora, every win is now a playoff opportunity and every loss just puts us one game further away from the playoffs,” Torre said.
