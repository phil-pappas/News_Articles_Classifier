Then he blew town. Murray rode the free agent train to NFC East rival Philadelphia in the offseason. He’s battled hamstring injuries and has yet to make a major impact with the Eagles. But the Cowboys are still racking up impressive rushing numbers. The backs that the New England Patriots say they’re concerned about heading into Sunday’s game at AT&T Stadium include Joseph Randle and Darren McFadden. The Cowboys (2-2) are averaging 107.8 yards a game. Randle leads the team in rushing with 229 yards. “They have a good offensive line, good coaching and the offense works well with what they do,” said Patriots linebacker Don’t'a Hightower. “They’re balanced, they work well together, they’re big and strong. It’s just a real good core group on the line. Whenever you have a group of good individuals and bring them together and make them jell and have chemistry that’s a strong-knit group.” Truth be told, the Cowboys would love to be crowing about the balance between their running and passing games right now. But with Tony Romo (shoulder) and Dez Bryant (foot) set to miss as much as half the season and pass-catching running back Lance Dunbar out for the entire season with an ACL injury, coach Jason Garrett is left scrambling for answers. He’s still letting backup quarterback Brandon Weeden throw often but besides star tight end Jason Witten, his other options are thin. The team’s second-leading pass catcher after Witten is receiver Cole Beasley, who has 18 catches. That’s why the Cowboys are happy to own a running game that appears capable of thriving without a star back such as Murray. The early-season success is all traced back to a talented, veteran offensive line that has drawn plenty of respect in Foxboro this week. “I would say they do a good job of getting the backs started in the running game,” New England coach Bill Belichick said. “They don’t have a lot of [defensive] penetration so there aren’t very many negative plays. They’re usually able to get the back into the line of scrimmage and get them going and it’s up to them, whether it’s Murray last year or Randle this year, those guys once they get in there make a lot of yards on their own. Dallas lines up with three first-round draft picks on the offensive line in guard Zack Martin (2014, from Notre Dame), tackle Tyron Smith (2011, Southern Cal) and center Travis Fredericks (2013, Wisconsin). Tight end Whitten is also regarded as an excellent blocker, as well as an elite pass catcher. Page 2 of 2 - “Witten is an excellent blocker and is part of that offensive line in the running game,” Belichick said. “He’s probably as good as we’ll face. He’s very experienced. He knows how to work it so you’re not just worried about him getting into the pattern; he’s good at the point of attack in the running game. They move him some so sometimes he’s on the move or you can’t really set your defense to him because at times he’ll change spots on you and then you have to relocate.” The Patriots have their own elite pass catching/blocking tight end in Rob Gronkowski but any comparisons between him and Witten are only positional, the Pats say. “Gronk, obviously, is Gronk. He’s a different species,” said veteran defensive end Rob Ninkovich. “His length and things he can do make him so special.” But Ninkovich has plenty of praise for Witten as well. “As a younger guy in the league you’re using a lot of your athleticism but as you get older you become smarter and wiser,” he said. “I think [Witten] has done a great job of using his athletic ability and as he’s gotten older he’s understanding the coverages and getting open and finding the soft spots in the zone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:14:13.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
