He’s got lines for almost every player. \n\"All aboard the Cain Train, Woo-W ,” he shouts. \nWinters has the hardware to back it up. \n“Got the cane from Louisville Slugger, got my name on it. But I actually named it. You know what its name is? Lorenzo,\" he said. \nThat’s just the tip of the blue iceberg. In his home/museum, you’ll find Royals hats, socks, shoes, baseball cards, dolls and memorabilia to help remember the greatness of his hometown team. \nHarvey knows how it started for her. \n“In 2009, my mom passed away and a couple weeks later my older brother passed away,” she said. \nThen Winters had major back operations and needed help getting to Kauffman Stadium. The siblings grew closer and learned to love the Royals even more. \nIf the Royals can’t take the crown this year, the siblings can always dream about next season. \n“Bring on October, bring on November. We're ready for it all,\" Winters shouts. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) All rights reserved.
