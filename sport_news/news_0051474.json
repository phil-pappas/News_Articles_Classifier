(Alonzo Adams-USA TODAY Sports) Reuters \nThe Oklahoma State Cowboys played with heavy hearts before a somber crowd after learning four people were killed when a car crashed into their homecoming parade. But the Cowboys scored on their first possession and were never threatened in their 58-10 win over the Kansas Jayhawks. \nCowboys quarterback Mason Rudolph completed 20-of-26 passes for 305 yards and a touchdown, while backup J.W. Walsh executed in the red zone and accounted for five touchdowns. Walsh added 68 yards passing and 24 rushing before QB Taylor Cornelius, a freshman, took over late in the third quarter. \nTakeaway \nA different feel to this homecoming, this game, was evident the moment the Oklahoma State squad began The Walk, which it conducts from the Student Union to Pickens Stadium for each home game. \nNormally the band plays. This time, however, the band was silent as news of the deadly crash that injured dozens and killed four swept through campus, and for that matter, the country. The incident happened roughly four hours prior to kickoff. \n“You walk out, and it’s just quiet,” Walsh told the Tulsa World. “The band’s not playing. It’s just different.” \nStill, fans gathered and wished the Cowboys the best, mindful of the fact the team was still going to play a football game and needed to be prepared, in spite of the circumstances. \n“As you’re walking, people are yelling our names, cheering for us, trying to be as positive as they can be in the situation, what it was, and trying to get us mentally ready to play a football game,” Walsh said. “You know, as different as it was, I think we all handled it well.” \nWide receiver David Glidden, who caught six passes for 91 yards, said the game was cathartic for the 59,000 in attendance, as well as the Cowboys themselves. \n“I personally could see in guys’ eyes, they wanted to get this done,” said Glidden, “and maybe give those people that had a complete shock, give them something to maybe brighten their day. Just to show that we’re coming out and we’re doing it more for just us, more than just our team. It’s for everybody in this town and community and state.” \nNext : at Texas Tech, Oct. 31. \nNotes And Quotes \nOklahoma State considered the postponement of its game against Kansas after four people were killed and dozens injured when a woman suspected of driving under the influence plowed a vehicle into a crowd at the Cowboys’ homecoming parade. \n“The decision was made that we’re going to play, and we’re going to remember the victims at the game,” Oklahoma State president Burns Hargis said. “We’re going to move forward, but we will remember what happened.” \nTragedy is not new to Oklahoma State. In 2001, a private plane crashed and killed 10 members of the men’s basketball program. Just four years ago, women’s basketball coach Kurt Budke and assistant Miranda Serna died when the single-engine plane they rode in crashed during a recruiting trip. \nThe mood inside Pickens Stadium was somber — quiet enough that the large American flag that flies over the stadium could be heard rippling as it was raised to half-staff. \nBefore the game, Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy embraced members of his team in a tight huddle as the Cowboys remembered the victims of the homecoming horror and prayed before taking the field against the Jayhawks. \nGundy, an Oklahoma State graduate who also played quarterback for the Cowboys, said he was apprised of the possibility of postponing the game and said he was fine with whatever decision his administration made. \n“I do want to reiterate that this one incident cannot take away from Oklahoma State University, and it cannot take away from homecoming and the celebration,” Gundy said. “That’s something that’s very important to us, and to me, to make a point that it is a great time of the year. \n“It’s a great weekend and a great day, and there’s a tremendous amount of pride and effort that goes into our homecoming, and that’s why it has been established the way that it is. I don’t want anything to be taken away from that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:54:56.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
