So we’ve got to keep it going.”\nThe Steelers, Bills and Jaguars have trailed by multiple scores during 23 of their 33 possessions against the Patriots this season, but it goes further than that. Since all three opponents received the game’s opening kickoff, remove each team’s first two possessions from the equation. Therefore, the Pats have staked their opposition to multiple-possession deficits on 23 of their 27 eligible drives.\nIt’s an absurd statistic that details how efficient the Patriots have been this season, and it’s also a credit to the Pats for creating the early advantage and sustaining that performance to maintain it.\n“We don’t pay attention to any of that,” safety Patrick Chung said. “You can’t really think about, ‘OK, we’re up two (scores), so we can play softer now.’ That’s when you get down two (scores) real quick. So if we’re up two (scores), continue to play the way we’ve been playing that got us up two scores.”\nConversely, the Patriots have only trailed for 5 minutes, 58 seconds all season, and that was the time it took them to overcome the Bills’ 7-0 advantage in Week 2. The Pats have had a lead for 144 minutes, 4 seconds of 180 minutes played, or 80 percent of their time on the field.\n“You like to get momentum and keep it,” wide receiver Danny Amendola said. “That’s important for the flow of the game and the points that are on the board to play well throughout 60 minutes.”\nThis is a contrast to the way the Patriots played down the stretch in 2014 when they dug themselves into too many early holes. Of course, that adversity helped them become the first team in history to wipe out two 14-point deficits in a playoff game against the Ravens, and gave them the confidence to pull off an historic 10-point, fourth-quarter comeback in the Super Bowl against the Seahawks.\nStill, that’s not exactly a blueprint for success. Remember, when the Pats fell behind early against the Packers (13-0), Chargers (14-3) and Jets (10-7) in Weeks 13-15, they routinely voiced their displeasure over their lethargic starts. That hasn’t been a problem so far this season.\nThe Patriots did a nice job handling their unique situations, as they managed their emotions after the banner dropped in Week 1, withstood a rowdy group of Bills who were out for blood in Week 2, and thoroughly dismantled the overmatched Jaguars in a Week 3 game that they could have won by sleepwalking for 60 minutes.\n“It’s definitely important to play well throughout the whole game, but to start fast and sustain that is something that we practice,” Amendola said.\nThose experiences will carry over into this month when the Pats visit the backup-ridden Cowboys on Sunday prior to a wildly hyped game against the Colts in Week 6. That’ll transition into a pair of divisional games in five days against the Jets and Dolphins at Gillette Stadium.\nNaturally, it’s unrealistic to believe the Patriots will storm through each foe with ease from here on out, but their dominance has been eye-opening to this point. Granted, the Steelers rallied to make it 28-21 with a garbage-time touchdown and the Bills nearly pulled off a miracle in Week 2, so the hot starts yielded cooler finishes. But it’s a whole lot less stressful than the alternative to play with a nice lead for most of the day.\nThe Patriots are working to keep that trend alive for as long as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:35:48.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
