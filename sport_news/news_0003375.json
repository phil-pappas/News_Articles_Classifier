Taylor led the Hornets in kills, and tied Hannah Johnson for most digs. \nOn the other side of the court, Cassidey Chrisman and Emma Casto had 10 kills apiece, while Kelly Coffey had 11. \nBut the most impressive performance came from Alice Wardy and libero Madison Cash, who may not have stood out in stats, but made a showing of their usefulness on the back line. \n“Our defense is all over the place,” Thompson said. “Volleyball is about momentum, and its huge momentum when you think a ball is about to drop and someone saves it or someone’s there to save something you thought was unsaveable.” \nWith the postseason just a little over a week away, Thompson joked that Riverheads has one very specific focus: \n\"Hitting the ball hard all the time.
