Here are some highlights.\nMattias Janmark has looked pretty good so far. Did management think he'd have this much of an impact so quickly?\nHeika: \"No, I don't think so. I think they think the best of every prospect, but he has earned this chance. He really shot up the depth chart in one month.\"\nAlso regarding Janmark, where do you think he fits in best? He did well as a center, but I've heard he plays wing too.\nHeika: \"He played well in camp with Cody Eakin as his center, and I think we will get to see that combination Tuesday. He's an aggressive skater who doesn't mind pushing up ice, so I think that fits well on the wing at times.\"\nCan Janmark keep the early success going throughout the year?\nHeika: \"He's a wildcard who has come out of nowhere, so we're not sure. But his game is an active one in which he skates hard to create and defend - and that is the perfect fit for this team.\"\nMattias has two goals. That's great. But he can't win a faceoff and seems extremely unsure with what to do with the puck in our zone. What has been your overall assessment of Janmark, without looking at the stat sheet?\nHeika: \"If you look at NHL faceoff stats every year, the bottom 20 are usually rookies. It's a learned skill at the NHL level.I think he's been great. I think he will play on the wing Tuesday and we'll see if that might be the best way to deploy him. He and Cody Eakin can also swap wing and center, so we'll see how they handle that.\"\nWho has been the most impressive player not named Janmark to start the season?\nHeika: \"Ales Hemsky is ahead of even Janmark to start.\"\nKnow it has only been two games but what do you think of Antti Niemi?\nHeika: \"I like him. He's very competitive and he backs up his aggression with strong detail work when the puck is around his net. He kicks out rebounds hard, but that's the only big flaw I see.\"\nWhat do you think the biggest area for concern is for the Stars right now? Tyler Seguin has kinda gotten off to a slow start?\nHeika: \"I think they are a team trying hard to transition to more detail work and that's going to require some adjustment. I think both Seguin and Jamie Benn are working to be better defensively, and that's going to hurt the offense. I believe he's moving back to center Tuesday, so it will be interesting to see how Seguin reacts to that.\"\nIf the Stars aren't really starting to contend next season, is it possible Jamie Benn might not choose to re-sign here?\nHeika: \"I don't get that impression at all. I think he loves it here and this is his team.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FULL CHAT.\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeHeika", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-stars/chats/2015/10/05/mike-heika-answers-stars-questions-2-pm-monday-oct-12-ask-questions-now", "https://twitter.com/MikeHeika"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:12:53.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
