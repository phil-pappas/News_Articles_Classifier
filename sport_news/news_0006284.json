Schoolchildren are encouraged to \"Trick or Treat for Central School\" on Halloween, using decorated milk containers from the school cafeteria, according to the Mount Prospect Historical Society. The money collected will go toward the effort to restore Central School, located on the historical society's campus at 101 S. Maple St. Collection jugs will also be placed at the library and village hall. For more information, call (847) 392-9006.
