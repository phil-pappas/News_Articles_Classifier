Comment Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 10:00 AM By Larry Dablemont Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 10:00 AM Pittsburg, Kan. As a deer hunter in the upcoming season, you need to know EXACTLY what the law requires you to do, and if a conservation agent comes to your door asking you to leave your home to help him drum up some kind of evidence against you, you can close the door and refuse to leave your home. I am quick to point out that there are plenty of agents who do their job right and do not abuse their power. But there are also those agents who violate the constitutional rights of those who hunt and fish, and they are accustomed to getting away with it. I have talked with older agents who say it is a result of an entirely different way of training than they saw in an earlier day. Whatever the cause, innocent people are often targeted, mostly because they don’t know their rights or the game and fish laws. Know your rights… know the laws. And don’t knuckle under to a conservation agent that is trying to bully you. No agent can enter your home, car or outbuildings without a search warrant unless there is knowledge of impending danger to someone inside. That comes from Chief of Enforcement for the Missouri Department of Conservation, Larry Yamnitz, who probably has never disciplined or fired an agent for anything. Three agents in Northwest Missouri illegally searched a barn and home of someone who was not at home at the time, without a search warrant. They were reported and the incident cost the MDC one million dollars in a lawsuit. NONE OF THE THREE WAS FIRED… ONE WAS PROMOTED!!! The upcoming deer season is complicated by one set of rules for one county and a different set for another. You have to know what all the laws are, so study them. Two years ago, a young man had to use his kids Christmas money to pay a 200 dollar fine because a pair of agents came to his house at 8 p.m. and demanded he show them where he killed a doe he had legally called in on a landowners permit TWO WEEKS BEFORE. He complied and was cited for killing the deer within the property of a neighbor, though he vehemently protested he had not. He was railroaded because he only owned five acres, and didn’t have the money to pay a lawyer. He broke no laws whatsoever, he simply was targeted. He should never have cooperated with those agents because they were violating his constitutional rights, simply drumming up charges they could not prove, without any evidence whatsoever. Know your rights!! Know when to say ‘no thank you’ and close your door. And by all means, study the deer hunting rules, as diverse and complicated as they have become. It is likely they will change often now, as it has recently, due to the progress of the chronic wasting disease. That awful disease could have been prevented by the Missouri Department of Conservation, whose lax treatment of those trying to make a fortune from penned deer, accounted for the introduction of sick deer, and the spread to wild deer in those areas. There is no way to know exactly where it exists because all regions of the Ozarks have those shameless “trophy buck growers”, and in many counties, no wild deer have been tested. Page 2 of 2 - Learn about that disease. It is known as “mad deer disease” but it is Jacob Cruetzfeldt disease when it spreads to humans. Deer hunters anywhere from North Missouri to North Arkansas need to know the truth about it, because you have the potential to kill and eat a diseased deer if you are not knowledgeable about those “prions” which cause it and where they are found in the body of a deer. There’s not enough space here to say all I would like to say about this subject.
