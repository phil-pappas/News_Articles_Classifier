In that respect we have had very fruitful discussions with the EU recently,\" Davutoglu told the news conference.\nBut he said that while progress had been made on an EU offer to Turkey last week of an action plan including \"re-energised\" talks on joining the bloc, as well as aid and the prospect of easier travel visas, several issues remained to be resolved.\n\"Firstly, the sharing of the refugee burden should be fair. The amount of aid...is secondary. What is more important is the common will to tackle this issue. Turkey has been left alone in recent years,\" he said.\nVisa-free travel for Turks should be brought forward to July 2016 instead of the current planned 2017 in return for Turkey signing a \"readmission agreement\" to allow in migrants sent back from Europe, he said. Turkey should also be allowed to participate in EU summits, he added.\n\"Germany is ready to offer support. If we take the question of visa liberalisation, we can talk in the German-Turkish working group ... about specific possibilities to push through visa facilitation,\" Merkel said.\nJust two months ago, Merkel was practically able to dictate terms to Greece over an aid plan to tackle its debt crisis. But over neighbouring Turkey, she has far less leverage to get her way, particularly as just 10 days ago, she reiterated her opposition to Turkey joining the European Union.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:15:17.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
