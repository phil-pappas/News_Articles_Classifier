Coach Monte Lee’s Tigers will play two games against the Bulldogs at Riley Park on March 15-16. It will be Clemson’s first visit to The Citadel since 1990, when the Bulldogs’ College World Series team beat the Tigers by 11-2 at the old College Park. The Citadel will host South Carolina on March 1, and takes on College of Charleston in a three-game series March 4-6. The first and third games of that series will be at Riley Park, with the middle game at the Cougars’ Patriots Point field. The season opens Feb. 19-21 with a three-game series against ACC foe Virginia Tech. Charleston Southern comes to Riley Park on March 29. “The non-conference part (of the schedule) is extremely challenging,” said Citadel coach Fred Jordan. “We will improve as the season goes along because of that competition so we will once again be prepared to make a run at the SoCon Tournament.” The Southern Conference tournament is set for May 25-29 in Greenville.
