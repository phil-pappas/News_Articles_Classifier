Baltimore signed free agent cornerback Shareece Wright, who played with San Diego last season and was on the 49ers' roster this season but did not play. The Ravens also signed Asa Jackson and Charles James off their practice squad. \nThe Buffalo Bills signed free agent quarterback Josh Johnson to provide depth behind backup EJ Manuel in the wake of a leg injury to starter Tyrod Taylor. Taylor's status for Sunday's game against Cincinnati is uncertain.

The trial in the 2012 killings of two Boston men was scheduled to begin Dec. 1. Judge Jeffrey Locke moved the start date to Jan. 19. Miscellany Steve Spurrier said he resigned as South Carolina's coach despite pleas from the university's president and athletic director to stay through the season. \nSpurrier, 70, said the team's poor start (2-4, 0-4 Southeastern Conference) helped him decide to go. \n\"I'm responsible. I'm the head coach,\" Spurrier said. \"It's time for me to get out of the way and let somebody else have a go at it.\" \nUSC athletic director Pat Haden defended both his hiring and firing of Steve Sarkisian, saying the troubled football coach passed a thorough background check and had no behavioral missteps until the past two months. \nFormer NBA player Lamar Odom has been hospitalized after he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel. There was no further word on his condition. Odom, 35, retired from the NBA in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:49:17.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
