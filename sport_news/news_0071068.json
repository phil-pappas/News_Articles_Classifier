I definitely think there’s some frustration. We have to simplify now. A lot of our offense comes off our defense.\"\nMixing it up \nFor the first time this season, coach Alain Vigneault switched up his line top three line combinations, trying to find some offensive spark in the third.\nJ.T. Miller replaced Nash on Derick Brassard’s left wing with Mats Zuccarello, Nash went on Derek Stepan’s right wing with Chris Kreider and Kevin Hayes, who had been on Stepan’s right wing, reverted to his last season’s role of third-line center with rookie Oscar Lindberg shifting to left wing and Viktor Stalberg on the right.\nStill, the Rangers were outshot, 13-7, in the third period.\nLine change \nEmerson Etem, 23, played 7:09 and was a minus-1 without a shot in his Rangers’ debut, playing on fourth-line center Dominic Moore’s left wing along with Jesper Fast.\n\"I try to put a positive spin on things,\" said Etem, acquired in the off-season from the Ducks for Carl Hagelin, of being a healthy scratch the first four games. \"It gave me a chance to see what the guys do in different situations so I took it as a time to build my game and build my knowledge.\"\nVeteran Jarret Stoll was a healthy scratch for the first time this season.\n— Andrew Gross", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:07.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
