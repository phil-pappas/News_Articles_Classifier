Eliot met with the media following Wednesday's practice to update his unit's progress during the bye week. You can read a full transcript of his comments below:\nOpening statement: “We had a full-padded practice. Anytime we’re in full-pads we’re emphasizing being physical. Getting off blocks and tackling, working on those things. Good competitive plays against the offense today, which we encourage that in these full-padded practices. We had an opportunity to do some reps at the end with some of our younger players. Got a chance to see some of the guys that are on the scout team compete within our defense and that’s always good to continue to develop those guys too.”\nOn if any young guys stood out: “I think Courtney Love is a good player and he’s doing some good things. I think Eli Brown has a bright future at linebacker. Those two guys stick out to me. We have plenty of other players that I could name, but I was focusing on the linebackers specifically today and I was impressed with those guys.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK Practice Report | Meant set to return\nOn getting into the backfield but not bringing down the quarterback: “A lot of it is, you have to understand what part of rush lane you’re in. You have to know where you’re supposed to miss the quarterback. So if you’re an inside rusher you have to make the quarterback flush. You can’t miss the outside of him and let him step up because there’s nobody there. If you’re an outside rusher, you have to miss on top if you’re going to miss, so that he steps up into the rest of the rushers. That’s something that we emphasize too, but when you come scot-ass clean, which we have a lot in our blitzes, you gotta be under control. When the pocket collapses and you get him on a pass rush, he doesn’t necessarily see the rusher and it’s easier to sack him. When you come clean, like we have a lot this year where no one is blocking you, then the quarterback can see that. It’s harder to get him down, so we’re emphasizing that those guys come under control and get him down when no one blocks them.”\nOn if Denzil Ware is practicing: “He is some. He’s getting some work in.”\nOn if he expects to have Reggie Meant back against Auburn: “I do. I do.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nTowles learning to deal with scrutiny\nOn what the plan is once Meant is back in regards to C.J. Johnson: “I think it’s a good problem. It’s a good problem to have. Both of those guys will play.”\nOn if they’ll stay in the same position: “They’ll both be defensive tackles. I anticipate them both playing our three-technique. But in different packages one may play the nose and one may play the three.”\nOn if C.J. Johnson is on track for 23 tackles this week: “(laughs) I told him ‘hey, anything less than 19 is going to be unacceptable.’”\nOn if he’s seen a defensive tackle make that many tackles: “I haven’t. I haven’t seen one make that many plays in a game. I haven’t. It’s impressive.”\nOn if during practice he saw that many tackles coming: “I said ‘you know what, he’s about to make 19,’ I could tell. (laughs). Just this week of practice, I project—no, I will say, I saw a player with a lot of talent. I saw a guy that for his size, can move very fast and explosive. I’ve seen that since he’s been here. So, he would move or he would strike somebody or he’d get off a block, I could see that explosiveness. I saw the talent in him.”\nSign up to get more like this free in your inbox", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3c508981868c63961bb3f5680226415622ee87c1/c=0-45-1997-1173&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Louisville/Louisville/635795061377190503-UKvsEKU08.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70d6f726b4c9d9b9eb1e537765c2548ef3d6fbcd/c=406-0-1739-1333/local/-/media/2015/08/08/Louisville/Louisville/635746507108770030-UKFanDay25.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:30:56.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
