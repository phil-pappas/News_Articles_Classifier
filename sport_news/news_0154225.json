Springfield (2-3) hosts Wayne (5-0) in the GWOC Central opener at 7 p.m. at Evans Stadium. \n“The GWOC Central, if you take that, you’re definitely getting in the playoffs,” said senior quarterback Saalih Muhammad. “It gives you that urgency as a senior knowing it’s the last time you’ll play those teams.” \nWayne, ranked No. 2 in Division I state poll, is winning by an average score of 37-10. The Warriors beat the Wildcats 53-14 last season. \nBut just like last week’s 79-yard touchdown by Danny Davis — where he took the handoff, cut left down the sideline and was gone against Butler — the Wildcats think their offense has turned the corner too. \nMuhammad has settled in as a double-threat quarterback, starting the last four games. He’s completed 60 percent of his passes (45 of 74) for 693 yards, nine touchdowns and two interceptions. He’s rushed for 293 yards on 60 carries. \nSenior receiver Jeremiah Ward and sophomore Leonard Taylor have stepped up in recent weeks, including last week’s 51-13 win against Butler. But the offense runs through Davis. \nThe junior leads Springfield with 372 yards rushing and four touchdowns on 42 carries (8.9 average) and 30 receptions — that’s exactly half of the Wildcats’ total — for 429 yards and five TDs. \n“He has a wide range. You get the ball up there, he can make a play on it,” Muhammad said of the luxury of throwing to Davis. “He’s just a guy who pushes you in practice, and he’s always on his game.” \nThe 6-foot-3, 187-pound Davis has college scholarship offers from Michigan State, Illinois, Iowa and Kentucky and just picked up offers from Wisconsin and Penn State in the last two weeks. Ohio State is also interested, but hasn’t offered, yet. \n“Just knowing I’m like anyone else,” Davis said of staying humble. “I don’t get a big head about nothing. I’m a normal person who goes to school just like everyone else. I’m just blessed with some athletic ability.” \nWith his impressive 79-yard score and one-handed TD catch last week, Davis ranks high on the Wildcats’ highlight reel. But he might not have Springfield’s most impressive athletic play this season. \nTaylor wowed Davis and his teammates against Miamisburg when the 6-5, 242-pounder hurdled a would-be tackler and picked up additional yardage. \n“I think he’s been watching some highlights of (Pittsburgh Steelers running back) Le’Veon Bell or somebody,” Davis said, laughing. “I didn’t expect him to get up that high. He’s huge. I was right there and watched him and was like, ‘Whoa!’ ” \nThat’s the same reaction the Wildcats want to elicit from high school football fans in the second half this season. The program has seen improvement under second-year coach Maurice Douglass. Now they want to take the next step. \n“We’ve been through the highs and the lows (this season),” Muhammad said. “We’re only getting closer. We’re going to be a better team. \n“The more you’re around a guy like Coach Doug, who’s been there and won state championships, he just makes you a better man. Your mind for football increases. Everything is better.” \nWeek 6 area schedule \n(7 p.m. start unless noted) \nBen Logan at Northwestern, 7:30 p.m. \nCedarville at Triad \nGreeneview at Catholic Central, WBZI-FM (100.3), MyClassicCountry.com \nGreenon at Urbana, 7:30 p.m. \nIndian Lake at Graham, 7:30 p.m. \nKenton Ridge at Tecumseh, 7:30 p.m., WIZE-AM (1340) \nMechanicsburg at WL-Salem \nShawnee at Tippecanoe, 7:30 p.m. \nWayne at Springfield, WSWO-FM (97.3), DaytonOldies.org More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:21:28.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
