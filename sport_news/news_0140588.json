Holmes and Bubba Watson got the Americans' only win of the day, beating Marc Leishman and Steven Bowditch 2 up, while Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson settled for a half point against Jason Day and Adam Scott.\nThe main talking point from that match, however, was the penalties imposed on the Americans on the seventh hole after Mickelson changed the type of ball he was playing.\nOfficials disqualified Mickelson from the hole, a decision they later conceded was incorrect, but then added insult to injury by hitting the United States with a one-hole penalty.\nWith Day winning that hole to put the Internationals one up in the match, they suddenly found themselves two ahead after the penalty was imposed on the Americans before the eighth.\nMickelson was reluctant to cast blame on the rules officials and said the responsibility lay with himself.\n\"It's the job of the player to know the rules,\" he said.\n\"It's not the committee's fault, they made a mistake. It's disappointing but they shouldn't have been put in that position.\"\nThe incident seemed to fire up the 45-year-old, who needed a captain's pick this year for the first time since 1994, and he delivered the shot-of-the-day at the 12th, his fairway bunker shot from 136 yards dropping near the pin and spinning sideways into the hole.\n'SHOCKINGLY NERVOUS'\nAfter winning just one of the 10 previous Presidents Cups, the Internationals have their best chance in years in Korea, the first Asian country to host the event, after the PGA Tour agreed to reduce the points on offer to 30 from 34.\nInternationals skipper Price, who played in five Cups, said he had been on tenterhooks throughout the day.\n\"I'm so proud of those guys, my nerves are shot,\" he added. \"We still have three rounds of golf to go. It's nerve-wracking being back there powerless.\"\nThe captain's decision to put Grace and Oosthuizen out first against the might of Spieth and Johnson proved a masterstroke. The South African duo earned the Internationals' only point on Thursday and were in confident mood.\nSpieth, however, said he and Johnson had gift-wrapped the point to the opposition.\n\"We both played very poor rounds of golf and we didn't have many chances, so it was Merry Christmas to the other guys,\" added the 22-year-old, who won two majors this year.\n\"That was one of the worst rounds of golf I've felt over the ball in a long time. I don't know what I owe it to but one of us was out of the fairway on every single hole and one of us was missing the green on every single hole.\"\nThe feel-good story of the day was South Korean Bae, who birdied the last to give his team the win.\nBae is playing in his last tournament before he begins mandatory military service and after a tough year on the PGA Tour needed a captain's pick to make the Presidents Cup team.\nAfter being benched for the opening day, Bae was a rock on Friday, carrying the erratic Lee throughout and sinking a match-winning 12-footer on the last to the delight of the home fans.\nLee said the tension had been unbearable.\n\"I'm pretty sure he was pretty nervous. I was nervous watching him,\" said Lee.\n\"He had to stand up and man up and hit that golf ball; I'm pretty sure he was shockingly nervous.\"\nPlay continues on Saturday with foursomes and four-balls before wrapping up on Sunday with 12 singles matches.\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:48:50.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
