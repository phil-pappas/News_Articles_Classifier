The Vail, Colo. skier won the event in 2011, but has not competed at the Austrian resort the past two seasons while recovering from injuries.\n\"I haven't made any definite plans on Soelden yet. I'm going to go there, get on snow and see how I feel,” Vonn told USA TODAY Sports on Monday during a phone interview.\n\"It definitely would be aggressive and asking a lot of me and my ankle, but it feels really good.\n\"I don't want to 100% rule it out, but I'd say it's more likely than not that I wouldn't race,” she said.\nVonn also has sponsor obligations this week, including a Head skis news conference in the picturesque Tyrolean resort which has hosted the season opening races since the early 1990’s.\nIf Vonn does not compete, her sights would then be set on the second giant slalom race of the season, in Aspen, Colo. on Nov. 28. The 2010 Olympic downhill gold medalist will begin her quest for her eighth World Cup downhill title in nine seasons, the following weekend in Lake Louise, Canada.\nIn her comeback season from a surgically repaired right knee, Vonn surprised many, winning eight races and finishing third in the 2014-15 overall World Cup standings, a respectable 466 points behind champion Anna Fenninger of Austria.\nThe U.S. ski racer, who has competed on tour since 2002, also surpassed the longstanding benchmark of 62 World Cup wins held by Austrian legend Annemarie Moser-Pröll. She enters the upcoming season with 67 lifetime victories, only trailing Sweden’s Ingemar Stenmark, who has 86.\nVonn said she is in a good state mentally after some soul searching following the breakup with ex-boyfriend Tiger Woods in May.\n“I definitely had some tough times there in the spring and early summer, but ultimately I think it was a good chance to focus on myself and get in a better place physically and mentally and train really hard,” Vonn said.\n“I think it’s good, I’m really motivated, I’m focused on just myself and my skiing and I hope that makes a difference with my performance.”\n2 CONNECT 28 TWEET LINKEDIN ", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808657690285707-VONN-1224-69263250.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7ae7c417e23f234ec5e79256877d25bc0b912ecc/c=286-0-4772-3373&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808657690285707-VONN-1224-69263250.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LGL0zY&text=Lindsey%20Vonn%20heading%20to%20Austria%20but%20hasn%27t%20decided%20on%20season%20opener&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LGL0zY&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808657690285707-VONN-1224-69263250.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:40:26.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
