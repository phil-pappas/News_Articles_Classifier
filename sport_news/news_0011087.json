Without four regulars defenders to start the game. And on the road against one of the hottest teams in college football, the Huskies were without much hope Saturday night. \nStanford beat down a beat-up Washington team 31-14 putting the 10th-ranked Cardinal in the driver's seat in the race for the Pac-12 Conference championship while sending the Huskies (3-4, 1-3 Pac-12) below .500 for the first time under Chris Petersen. \nWith freshman quarterback Jake Browning sidelined by an injury to his right (throwing) shoulder, redshirt freshman K.J. Carta-Samuels made his first start for the Huskies. He had come into the game having attempted just three career passes. \nThe Huskies were forced to shuffle their defense with four new starters because of injuries and a first-half suspension for safety Brian Clay. UW then lost starting cornerback Kevin King early in the third quarter to an apparent leg injury. \nUW didn't let the game get completely out of hand, but that's about the best that can be said of the Huskies' performance. Ultimately, Stanford's physical style worn down the Huskies, whose short-handed defense was on field for nearly 38 minutes. \nStanford (6-1, 5-0) was never threatened in the first half, needing just three minutes to take the game's opening drive 62 yards and building a 7-0 lead. It was 17-0 at halftime. \nWith possession to start the second half, the Huskies got a 43-yard return from true freshman Chico McClatcher and then handed the ball off to true freshman Myles Gaskin on five consecutive plays, resulting in runs of 3, 12, 28 and a 14-yard TD run. \nThat cut Stanford's lead to 17-7. \nGaskin again was a bright spot for the UW offense. The O'Dea High School product topped the 100-yard mark for the third consecutive game, the first true freshman in school history to do that. \nAfter Gaskin's touchdown, the Cardinal came right back with a 50-yard touchdown pass from Kevin Hogan to Christian McCaffrey, pushing the lead to 24-7. \nMcCaffrey added a 7-yard TD run late in the third to extend the lead to 31-7. McCaffrey finished with more than 300 all-purpose yards to bolster his Heisman hopes. \nCarta-Samuels, from nearby Saratoga, Calif., was just 3 for 10 for 17 yards in the first half, often throwing off his back foot as the Stanford's blitzing defenders approached. Through three quarters, he was 5 for 13 for 37 yards. \nCarta-Samuels then orchestrated his best drive of the day, capped by the first touchdown run of his career, from 7 yards out. He had sidestepped one defender near the line of scrimmage and then dived ahead at the goal line. He was 4 for 5 for 81 yards on the drive. \nThat touchdown got the Huskies within 31-14 with 11:36 left. They wouldn't get any closer. \nEn route to building a 17-0 halftime lead, Stanford held the ball for almost 22 of the 30 minutes in the first half, gaining 241 yards. The Huskies managed just 58 yards on 18 first-half plays, never crossing midfield.
