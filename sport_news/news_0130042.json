The leaders of Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania and Slovenia will meet their counterparts from non-EU states Macedonia and Serbia on Sunday, the office of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said. “In view of the unfolding emergency in the countries along the western Balkans migratory route, there is a need for much greater cooperation, more extensive consultation and immediate operational action,” a statement said. The continent has been struggling to find a unified response to tackle its biggest refugee crisis since 1945. More than 600,000 migrants and refugees, mainly fleeing violence in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, have braved the dangerous journey to Europe so far this year, the UN said. The goal for many travelling along the western Balkan route is the EU’s biggest economy Germany, which expects to take in up to one million refugees this year. Since Saturday, when Hungary sealed off its border with Croatia, more than 21,455 migrants have arrived in Slovenia, a nation of two million people. In response to the crisis, Prime Minister Miro Cerar yesterday asked the EU for backup from police forces in other EU countries and extra equipment for its own officers. The Slovenian parliament also amended the country’s defence law early Wednesday to allow soldiers to join border police in patrolling the 670-kilometre frontier with Croatia. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:09:08.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
