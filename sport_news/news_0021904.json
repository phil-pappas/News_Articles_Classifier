I don’t care what our record is right now. We’ve got another opponent coming up and they’re just as important. No matter where we are right now, if we don’t finish, the start won’t be remembered. We’ll be remembered how we wouldn’t finish.” \nOn the other side of the locker room, fellow defensive end Michael Johnson carried the same attitude. \nBut, 5-0. That hasn’t been done in Cincinnati since 1988, a Super Bowl season. \n“I was born in ’87, so trying to get 6-0,” Johnson said as he grabbed his back to head out. “Trying to get to 6-0 and we’ll go from there.” \nThis is the tone set by head coach Marvin Lewis – one struck before the season even began. One at a time, and when it’s over, it’s over. \n“We did a good job at winning those football games,” Lewis said. “There’s no reason to puff smoke.” \nHe allowed himself a chuckle at that, but no revelry. And there is none in his locker room. \nLewis was pressed on Monday to compare this squad to other teams in his tenure – perhaps the 2005 team that went 4-0? He just shook his head. He doesn’t do comparisons. And he wasn’t about to say his team was great for having won its first five games. \n“No,” Lewis said. “We’ve done what we were asked to do. We don’t put the schedule together. We knew our job was to go out and win each game, one at a time. That’s what they’ve done. They’ve done a good job of preparation, playing, and playing for 60 minutes. That’s what counts, if you don’t do that, you lose.” \n“We have to be one point better than the opponent every Sunday.” \nA.J. Hawk smiled at this. He’s heard it before. Namely, the Green Bay Packers team he was a part of last year, which advanced to the NFC Championship game. Hawk is also the only member of the current roster to win a Super Bowl, in 2010. \n“That’s the thing, there’s nothing really to talk about,” Hawk said. “It’s cliché. Yeah it sucks because you feel like you’re giving a stock answer when you say ‘we’re on to the next one’ but it’s true. We’re not having any parties for ourselves. We’re not celebrating too much.” \nHawk said they enjoy the moment of victory in that moment, but because of Lewis – that ends quickly. Gio Bernard keys run-game versatility \nILOKA ON BIG HIT: Five plays into the overtime session, Russell Wilson scrambled around on a 2nd-and-15 play from his own 29 – which allowed rookie wide receiver Tyler Lockett to get behind the Bengals defense. Wilson launched the ball high, allowing Dre Kirkpatrick and George Iloka to converge. \nIn Iloka’s mind, there was only one option: separate ball from man. \n“That’s my first mindset,” said the safety, who returned to action for the first time since removing himself from the Baltimore game with an ankle injury. \n“If it’s a tweener, I’m going to try and go for the hit instead of playing the ball. He had a step on the defense – I don’t know how he got back there – but whatever. I saw Russell do his thing. He was back there in the pocket and he just launched it. I saw the receiver and I’m like if he catches it, he’s going to make a great catch, but I’m putting everything into this hit. I’m not stopping.” \nIloka knew he might flirt with a pass interference, but trusted his timing. \n“I was like yeah, I’m going to just hit him as hard as I can and if he catches it, you gotta tip your hat. They get paid too. That was my mindset going through that play.” \nThe incompletion led to a third down check down from Wilson to Fred Jackson and a Seattle punt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:33:09.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
