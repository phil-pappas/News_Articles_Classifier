He took four strides \"before driving into a high, late hit that makes Silfverberg's head the main point of contact,\" Patrick Burke said in the NHL department of player safety video. Silfverberg left the game for precautionary reasons, but he is not suffering from any injuries.\nSilfverberg was stripped of the puck 0.8 seconds before he was hit by Torres, well past the time allowed for a legal check, Burke explained.\n\"Rather than remaining crouched and driving through his opponent's right shoulder, Torres drives his shoulder up and through the head of Silfverberg,\" Burke said.\nUSA TODAY\nNHL team-by-team 2015-16 season previews\nThe suspension is one of the longest in NHL history, but Torres' past, one that includes four suspensions, three fines and two warnings, was a factor. He's played 15 games, partly due to injuries, since he was last suspended May 2013 for an illegal hit on then-Los Angeles Kings forward Jarret Stoll.\nThe collective bargaining agreement, cited in the NHL department of player safety video, says, \"Players who repeatedly violate league playing rules will be more severely punished for each new violation.\"\nHe will forfeit $440,860.29 in pay for the latest hit.\nUSA TODAY\n10 bold predictions for 2015-16 NHL season\nThough Torres is not a repeat offender under the CBA, he has \"repeatedly violated league playing rules and has been sanctioned multiple times for similar infractions,\" Burke said.\nTorres was also suspended in April 2011 for an elbow to the head of Edmonton Oilers forward Jordan Eberle, December 2011 for a charge on Minnesota Wild defenseman Nate Prosser and in April 2012 for a late, high hit on Chicago Blackhawks forward Marian Hossa in which he violated three NHL rules.\nThe hit on Hossa resulted in a 25-game suspension, which was revised to 21 games after Commissioner Gary Bettman heard Torres' appeal.", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2015/10/05/nhl-bold-predictions-kessel-jagr-roy-blackhawks-boudreau-kreider/73339132/", "http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/embed?playlist=840482", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8da597505ee6548db3f0fed496164858d600d4bc/c=343-0-3140-2797/local/-/media/2015/09/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635782004724294420-USATSI-8496973.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/630468cb6f04a38541d5d86b7a3c19a0325574b1/c=0-0-2787-1575&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795676056382836-c02-stamkos-0611.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2015/09/18/team-season-previews/72429362/"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:09:42.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
