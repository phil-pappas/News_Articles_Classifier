Similar petitions filed this spring endured an eyebrow-raising journey through the state attorney general's office , which produces the all-important ballot titles voters read when deciding to say \"yes\" or \"no.\" Gibson's latest proposal will give Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum's attorneys another chance to produce a ballot title that exhibits the neutrality the process is supposed to ensure.\nThe attorneys who produce ballot titles have at the very least a perception problem when it comes to handling initiatives that affect public employee unions. That's because the attorneys themselves are represented by a union – the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. Meanwhile, ballot initiatives that interest public employee unions are commonplace and include tax hikes proposed by union-affiliated groups and proposals, like Gibson's, that could reduce union funding.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

The ballot title for Gibson's most recent proposal was overseen by an AFSCME member. It received a clear and straightforward draft ballot title, but the final, or certified, title was skewed to such a degree in favor of unions that the underlying conflict begged to be discussed. And it was, by us and others.\nThis month, Gibson filed a substantially equivalent initiative. It would allow public employees in unionized workplaces who don't belong to unions to withhold \"fair share\" payments, which unions may collect even from nonmembers to cover the cost of representation. The measure also would prohibit unions from representing these employees.\nTime will tell whether Rosenblum's office produces, at last, a neutral ballot title. What we do know, however, is that the attorneys who produce ballot titles don't enjoy having their conflict of interest discussed and their work held up for scrutiny. We get it. And as we've said in the past, the fact that union members have produced unbalanced ballot titles for initiatives that interest public employee unions does not prove ill-intent or anything more serious.\nHowever, the conflict is real, and public scrutiny of the ballot title process is not only appropriate but, given Gibson's experience, necessary. We don't blame Rosenblum's attorneys for disliking the attention they've received as a result. But a solution is available to them. They could begin the process for decertification.\nValleys\nOregon graduation rate: There's good news and bad news here. The good news? Oregon schools' graduation rate showed improvement of 4 percentage points from last year compared with the rest of the country. The bad news? We're still way, way at the bottom.\nAs The Oregonian/OregonLive's Betsy Hammond reported , the state's 72 percent graduation rate was the fourth-worst in the country, according to new figures from the U.S. Department of Education. And while we're no longer the worst in the country overall (eat our dust, New Mexico, Nevada and Alaska), the state's 74 percent graduation rate for white students remains the lowest across the country. The state's graduation rates for minority groups are among the cluster of states at the bottom as well. The \"achievement gap,\" which refers to performance differentials between white students and low-income or minority students, might also be used to describe Oregon students as a whole with the rest of the nation.\nEducation officials like to claim that Oregon is more honest about how it tracks and reports its graduation rate. That may be true, but it doesn't change the very real problem of how many students are failing to earn a high school degree in four years. Nor does it change the high absentee rate at too many schools, as Hammond has documented . At the same time, you have families challenging the state's embrace of higher educational standards and the tests that measure whether kids are meeting those benchmarks.\nThe state's \"40-40-20\" goal , where 40 percent of students earn a bachelor's degree or higher; 40 percent earn an associate's degree or certificate; and the remaining 20 percent achieve at least a high school degree by 2025 now seems ... ambitious. At least something in Oregon's education system is.\nMarijuana rules: The Oregon Liquor Control Commission did right this week in approving rational regulations for the recreational marijuana market.\nChief among the challenges was creating a way around a parochial stipulation the Legislature wrote into the law implementing Measure 91: that applicants for a marijuana-selling license be Oregon residents for a minimum of two years.\nThe OLCC recognized that such a rule could put the brakes on robust entrepreneurship and would, when joined with another rule dictating that Oregonians hold a majority ownership stake in new pot businesses, constitute a form of protectionism. So on Thursday they crafted a rule that helps applicants who fail to meet the residency requirement by keeping their applications pending – this pending a change in the state law in the next legislative session.\nRob Patridge, chair of the OLCC, received a letter in recent weeks from a bipartisan group of lawmakers who'd led the implementation of Measure 91 but who now say they've revised their thinking and view the residency requirement as problematic. The lawmakers – Democratic Rep. Ann Lininger and Republican Sen. Ted Ferrioli among them – are expected to advocate a revision to the law and eliminate the residency requirement in the 2016 session.\nThat would ensure Oregon truly is open for business when it comes to selling recreational pot – a good thing.", "external_links": ["http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/CHRO/docs/lr/13_15_OAJA_final.pdf", "http://oregonlearns.org/oregons-challenge/the-40-40-20-goal/"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:46:41.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
