My left hip is really sore. A bit of physio and relaxing this afternoon, and I'll try and figure that out. Maybe I wasn't quite clearing through the ball as well as yesterday but I'll be fine. \n\"Obviously I'm in a wonderful position going into the weekend. This course gave me some trouble last time I played it, so it was nice to figure out more of a decent game plan, which has paid off so far.\" \nPoulter, who only arrived in Hong Kong at 7pm on Wednesday, carded six birdies and two bogeys as he looks to win the Hong Kong Open for the second time. \n\"I g ot a decent amount of sleep last night, which is always handy,\" Poulter said. \"I fell asleep at 7.45 and I wasn't looking forward to what time I was going to wake up, but I managed to get through to 4am. \n\"There's a lot of good golf in there. I'm very happy and obviously it's nice to be in this position. \n\"I don't play to take part, I obviously play to win. Even coming in as late as I did, focusing on shooting a good score was really key. And I know this golf course. I've shot 60 around here before. \n\"So albeit that I had not played a practice round, I've got good memories on this golf course. I know the place, I like it. And hopefully I can have a good weekend.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:14:03.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
