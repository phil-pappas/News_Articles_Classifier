It’s outstanding that they’re already contributing to us as varsity players.\" \nCunningham, who also displayed a powerful leg in getting the ball out of her zone, made a diving stop with nine minutes left to keep Mahwah at bay, then made another sensational stop with 4:19 left, but nothing like the two she made on Mahwah’s Sarah Jordan in the second overtime. \nJordan scored the Thunderbirds’ lone goal on a breakaway with 6:44 remaining in regulation. \nMichelle Silva made seven saves for the Thunderbirds, including a big one with 1:30 left in the first overtime. \nIn the second overtime, Cunningham slid to stop one of Jordan’s shots with 1:54 left and made another save with just seconds left before the penalty kicks began. \n\"I’ve been in these situations before,\" said Cunningham, mentioning club soccer experience. \"I just handle the pressure. I zone out the crowds and block out everyone to get it done.\" \nCunningham then made one diving stop on a penalty kick to help the Maroons advance to next week’s semifinals. \nLandino, who entered the game as a reserve in the first half, gave the Maroons a 1-0 lead with an alert play in the 67th minute, securing a pass from Val Diaz and converting. \n\"I was so open that I had to make it,\" Landino said of her third varsity goal. \nLandino was the third and final Maroon player to nail a penalty kick, preceded by Mari Fernandez and Annie Shaw. \n\"Everyone is depending on you when you take penalty kicks,\" Landino said. \"Obviously, I had to make it.\" \n\"It’s a tough one to take,\" said Mahwah coach Courtney Carrelha, who saw her team fall to 8-2-2 overall. \"It was a learning experience for us. I said to the girls that this is out of our hands to have this happen. We played extremely hard. We just now have to focus on what we did well here, because we still have a lot to play for.\" \nThe Maroons move on to play Paramus Catholic on Sunday. The Paladins defeated the Maroons, 2-1, earlier in the season. \nPARAMUS CATHOLIC 0, PARK RIDGE 0 (2 OT): The upset was there for the taking for little Park Ridge, the 13th seed in the BCT, against No. 4 Paramus Catholic. \nBut Paramus Catholic (8-2-1) converted on four straight penalty kicks to beat the Owls (10-0-2) and advance. \nMelyna Portal converted on the fourth and final penalty kick that allowed the Paladins to move on. \n\"It’s a really big role,\" said Portal, a senior captain. \"We practice PKs all the time, so I was ready. I go last because of tradition and superstition. I just had a feeling I was going to make it, but I was shaking so much that I wanted to cry.\" \nLuckily teammate Reyna Villar was rock solid in goal, making six saves during regulation and overtime, then made a diving stop to her right during the shootout portion. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:25:53.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
