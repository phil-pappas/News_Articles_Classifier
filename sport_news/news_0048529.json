Too many deaths. Too much grief. And yet on a Friday night that might have been spent focusing on nothing more than two great high school football teams playing an epic game, all I could do was look for No. 75.\nThat would be West Linn High's Alex Forsyth.\n\"We're all here for each other,\" he said.\nVisiting Sherwood High beat the Lions 39-35 in a thrilling game that was so well attended that it ended with families clinging to the barrier around the field as the final meaningful pass of the game fell incomplete in the end zone.\nThere were electric plays by both sides, including a touchdown dash by West Linn's Elijah Molden that belonged in a Tecmo Bowl game and a game-shifting pick-six interception by Sherwood's Lukas Adams. But it was the piles of players at the line of scrimmage I found myself looking toward.\nAll night. Those piles. Because in the middle of all that was a 16-year old two-way player who may just be able to teach us all something.\n\"It's sad that it takes a tragedy to bring a community together,\" he said.\nThe shooting in Roseburg at Umpqua Community College that killed nine innocent people sparked the latest predictable pattern. It goes something like this: shock, followed by outrage and sadness, followed by a passionate gun debate, followed by political posturing, followed by forgetting.\nThen, another tragedy comes.\nAlex knows. Nearly three years ago a shooter walked into the Clackamas Town Center shopping mall and opened fire. Two people were killed. One of them was Alex's father, Steve.\n\"I won't go back inside,\" Alex said. \"Even when we drive past the place I get that bad feeling back.\"\n---\nA terrible car accident in June 2014 killed softball player Maddie Higgins and her boyfriend Hayden Soyk. Another awful three-car crash early this year took two other West Linn High classmates, Cooper Hill and Antonio Caballero. There were two suicides, too.\n\"Cancer, heart attacks, falls off ladders,\" West Linn High's school registrar, Michelle Hoover, reeled off a list of recent family tragedies, \"the kids are accustomed to grief being normal. Makes me horribly sad.\n\"It's hard to watch.\"\nMaybe you heard the news of the shooting at Umpqua Community College and thought of your own children. Maybe you wondered about the ways our society has failed. Maybe you just shook your fist or your head or both. Many at West Linn High told me on Friday night that their first thought was of No. 75.\nSteve Forsyth used to coach his son in football. Started in the third grade. He was a giant man with a big presence (just like his 6-foot-4, 300-pound son) and especially full of life and laughter.\nOn Friday, during the game, a half-dozen youth football coaches who were some of Steve's best friends slipped behind the crowd-control barriers before kickoff and joined coach Chris Miller's program on the home sideline. The men feel like stakeholders. Not in the program. Rather, in the kids. They walked up and down the sideline, moving with the line of scrimmage all night, like a coaching chain gang.\n\"Look at Alex out there, playing both ways,\" one said to me, \"his dad would be so proud of him.\"\n---\nAt one end of the stadium on Friday, under the scoreboard, three pastors at Willamette Christian Church spent the evening against a barrier beyond the end zone, watching. The church sits in the heart of the community and so Joel Dombrow, the church's lead pastor, bellied up to a night of football alongside youth pastors Chris Nye and Andrew Martin.\nDombrow has a son who attends West Linn High and plays basketball for the Lions. The other two men know many of the students at the school. In fact, if you drive past the front of the high school on a given night, you're likely to find Martin and his wife walking their dog, as they bought a home just a couple of blocks from the campus to be nearby.\n\"I'm the guy always out walking that husky dog,\" Martin said.\nHe and Nye are charged with working with students on a daily basis, mentoring, counseling, facilitating the church's growing youth programs. Connecting with leaders and athletes on campus has been an integral strategy. Nye joked that they were early-adopters as \"courtside season-ticket holders\" for Lions basketball games.\n\"We sit in front of the student section, we'll save you a spot,\" he said.\nDombrow said, \"It's incredibly difficult seeing so much loss and grief and suffering... meeting with family members, hearing stories, planning memorial services -- knowing there's nothing I can do or say to bring back a son or daughter, a brother or sister, a classmate or teammate, a friend.\"\n---\nA shooter opens fire in a public place and there's an immediate disconnect for most of us. We didn't hear the shots up close. We weren't shot ourselves. Most of us didn't lose an immediate family member or close friend. Rather, just a sense of safety and sanity. We can only relate, as any American community might, to the loss not only of life, but of life as we know it.\nBut No. 75 understands on a deeper level.\n\"I feel for the families in Roseburg,\" Alex Forsyth said, \"I know what they're going through.\"\nAlex is a high school junior now. He's on Oregon's recruiting radar, and was invited to one of the Ducks' mini-camps where he worked closely with offensive line coach Steve Greatwood. He's received a couple of letters from Mark Helfrich's program. He'd love to play college football someday on scholarship somewhere. Also, he'd love it if the senseless acts of violence would stop.\nAlex said that he still appreciates when people approach and talk to him about his dad. He cherishes the thoughts, and stories, and even those over the years who gave him looks but didn't quite know what to say. He appreciated that I wanted to talk with him for this column, even as it came in the wake of a disappointing football loss on Friday.\n\"I think the best thing you can say is, 'Hey I'm here for you if you need it,\" Alex said. \"'I know you're hurting right now,' is sometimes exactly what you need to hear.\"\nIt's true what they say -- life goes on. Time passes. People pick up and move on. One season replaces the next. Even with a mass shooting, the President of the United States visits, then flies out to a fundraiser. The rest of us look around, wondering what's changed.\nWest Linn has had enough grief to last a long while. Maybe the community can teach us something about dealing with loss. Maybe a player like Alex Forsyth can teach us something about the courage of those who never get to really forget.\n\"I think one of the responsibilities we have as a community is for the losses to stay with us, as well,\" Dombrow said. \"To not forget.\"\nSo yeah. Sherwood beat West Linn by four points on Friday night in a game both teams may not soon forget. Tim Tawa, the Lions' star quarterback who hadn't thrown a single interception all season, was intercepted at the worst time imaginable on a great play by Sherwood. It was returned for the game-winning touchdown.\nI watched Tawa in the minutes after the game. He was surrounded by his coaches, and his teammates at first, and then, at one point he walked past me, wondering aloud, \"Why did I do that?\"\nA few strides later, a teammate appeared to give him a pat on the helmet.\nIt was No. 75.\nSoon after, the entire Lions team was gathered together at one end of the field. And you know, within minutes, droves of student at the game had filed out of the student section at West Linn High. They didn't move toward the parking lot. Instead, they took the field and surrounded their beaten team.\nSaid Alex: \"We're a big family now.\"\n-- @JohnCanzanoBFT", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/JohnCanzanoBFT"], "published": "2015-10-11T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:11:59.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
