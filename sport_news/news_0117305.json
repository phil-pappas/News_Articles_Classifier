But after a short pass over the middle to Eric Decker left the Jets 37 yards away from tying the game, Marshall failed to get set on Ryan Fitzpatrick’s spike to stop the clock; the false-start penalty ended it.\n“I feel like we had them,” offensive lineman Willie Colon said. “I feel like we were the better team out there, but obviously we were not. They beat us fair and square.”\nFitzpatrick completed 22 of 39 passes for 295 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Chris Ivory, who entered as the AFC’s leading rusher, was held to 41 yards on 17 carries while dealing with a sore hamstring; he also had two catches for 12 yards and a touchdown. Decker caught six passes for 94 yards.\nRob Gronkowski had a career-high 11 catches for 108 yards and a touchdown, Danny Amendola had eight for 86 and a TD and Brady also scored on a keeper from the 1 to give the defending Super Bowl champions their ninth straight victory, dating to last year’s playoffs. Brady also had an 11-yard scramble on a third-and-10, and with 15 rushing yards he was the Patriots’ leading runner for the first time in his career.\n“I should enjoy this, because it will probably never happen again,” said Brady, who threw the ball on all but nine plays — tying the NFL record for the fewest rushes in a win.\nThe Jets, who had won two in a row, had hoped to tie the Patriots for the AFC East lead and take control of a division that has been dominated by the four-time Super Bowl champs. But now they must wait for the Dec. 27 rematch in New York, when the Jets will try to beat New England for just the second time in 11 regular-season tries.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:15:56.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
