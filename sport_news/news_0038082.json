Sun Devils head coach Todd Graham and company have been the kryptonite to the No. 4 Utes , but this year's a different story.\nGraham has publically declared that this year's version of the Utes compared to last year's is like \"night and day\" to him. Is this the year Utah finally gets past ASU? In preparation for the showdown, The Deseret News caught up with Arizona State football beat writer Chris Karpman with SunDevilSource.com to get the inside scoop.\nDN: ASU is coming off of two pretty big wins, including the upset win over UCLA . How hot is this team right now and should the undefeated Utes be worried?\nCK: The Sun Devils still aren't firing on all cylinders but are starting to move in that direction, and I'm sure aspire to be playing their best football in the second half of the season. Defensively, ASU has played very impressively, especially its run defense. Every opposing team it has played has ended up with fewer rushing yards than its average, and some impressive running backs have been largely held in check or completely taken out of the game. That of course will be ASU's goal this week against Utah's talented Devontae Booker, who may be the best running back in the league, and is certainly its biggest workhorse. ASU has made a major emphasis to improve its special teams, which have been abysmal in recent years, and in that regard it is starting to show a lot of progress. Its last two games in that regard were its best efforts of the year and maybe in multiple years. Offensively, ASU is starting to settle in but still doesn't have the potency we've seen from it at earlier junctures of the Todd Graham era in Tempe.\nDN: What kind of offense do the Sun Devils run? Other than ASU QB Mike Bercovici, who should Utah keep an eye on in ASU's offense?\nCK: It's a no huddle, run, play-action pass offense with zone read principles that heavily relies on its wide range of formations without a need to substitute to different personnel groupings. ASU often uses two back and two tight end formations, likes to throw the ball to its backs and tight ends, wants to keep defenses honest laterally across the line of scrimmage with the quarterback being a run threat, and on the perimeter via the screen game. Senior D.J. Foster is the only FBS player in the country with more than 2,000 yards rushing and 2,000 yards receiving. He's played more of a wideout role this season than in the past, but starting sophomore running back Demario Richard hurt his right knee against Colorado last week and his status is undetermined for Saturday, so Foster may see more action in the backfield. Richard is a bowling ball type running back, hard to bring down, good inside zone runner. Sophomore running back Kalen Ballage is an angular and explosive in space 6-foot-3, 225 pounds. At wide receiver, junior Tim White is an emerging standout as a junior college transfer after a broken bone in his hand slowed him early in the season, and senior Devin Lucien, a UCLA post-graduate transfer, is another top target of Bercovici on the outside.\nDN: Utah's offense is clearly led by running back Devontae Booker. How do the Sun Devils plan on slowing him, and the rest of the offense down? Who is the X-factor on defense for ASU?", "external_links": ["http://ncaa-football-teams.pointafter.com/l/209/Arizona-State-Sun-Devils-NCAA-Football", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team91.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "https://s.graphiq.com/rx/widgets.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:15:09.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
