No false hope! We are more than a quarter of the way through the NFL season, and there is an odor of desperation across this fine nation.\nIn a lot of NFL cities, if you Google “Super Bowl tickets,” the computer just laughs at you and automatically shuts itself off.\nMore Jason Gay\nOne Word America: Cubs! Only One Game of Cubs-Pirates? Booo! Sports Sitting Will Kill Us All In the Middle of Football, Brilliant Bikes Bike Worlds Are Here, So Is Taylor Phinney Here’s how to tell if your NFL team is out of it:\n1. You’re a Dolphins fan.\n2. Sunday mornings now feel worse than Monday mornings.\n3. Your fantasy team now is the second-most depressing team in your life.\n4. You watch the Patriots or the Packers and it’s as if they are from another planet, playing an altogether different sport.\n5. You watch your NFL team play and it doesn’t look like they’re even playing football. It looks as if they’re wandering around a cornfield looking for somebody’s keys.\nENLARGE Green Bay Packers fans cheer during a game at Lambeau Field. Photo: Christian Petersen/Getty Images 6. You would trade your children to Green Bay just for one season of Aaron Rodgers as your team’s quarterback. No offense, kids! You can come home to Mom and Dad after the Super Bowl.\n7. You’re quite certain your old-timers team could beat the current team.\n8. Sports radio in your town just sounds like somebody sitting on a goose. I mean, it always sounds sort of like somebody sitting on a goose, but it now sounds exactly like somebody sitting on a goose.\n9. You no longer have the heart to body paint your entire body in team colors; you’re simply painting face and neck and weeping gently into the mirror.\n10. When you go to turn on the TV on Sunday, your TV hides. It just climbs right down off the wall and hides in a closet or a kitchen cabinet or, better yet, down in the basement. After a half-hour of searching, you find your TV next to some mops and an abandoned exercise bicycle, nervously shuddering, begging: Please don’t make me do another Lions game. I’ll show anything else instead. I’ll show “You’ve Got Mail!” “Green Lantern!” “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2!”\n11. You only make depressing game day snacks. When you had everyone over for the game Sunday, you served them gruel and sticks.\n12. At halftime, all of your guests ask for seconds of gruel and sticks.\n13. You don’t mind all the DraftKings and FanDuel commercials; at least your team can’t surrender points during the break. Oh wow, they just did.\n14. At the start of the fourth quarter, you now turn the channel to a nice documentary about rabbits.\n15. After the game is over, you sadly rake leaves dressed in your official team Slanket. You look across the street, and the neighbor is also sadly raking leaves in an official team Slanket.\n16. When you went to the therapist this week, you spent two minutes talking about your marriage and 43 minutes talking about Andrew Luck.\n17. You signed up for a “Tough Mudder” race next weekend in which participants must run through 2 kilometers of slop, crawl under barbed wire, and watch the entire Texans-Jaguars game.\n18. When you tried to give a pair of Kansas City Chiefs tickets away at work, you got a stern talking-to from human resources.\n19. You announce to friends and family that you are now available for Sunday afternoon activities of all kinds. Kids want to go apple picking? Great. Let’s go now. Friend from work is moving? Perfect. Let me carry that crate of vinyl LPs. Spend five hours shopping for a new bedroom set at IKEA? Sounds glorious. I am in!\n20. Shopping at IKEA turns out to be far more fun than your typical NFL Sunday.\n21. You’re no longer furious about your Cousin Ed’s wedding in November. Last June when the invitation came, and it said “November 15,” you couldn't contain your rage. Is that a Sunday? Who has a wedding on an NFL Sunday? Is that even legal? Now you are absolutely thrilled to spend a Sunday with Cousin Ed. Cousin Ed, let me buy you a bourbon and a Slanket.\nENLARGE A Chicago Bears fan wears a No. 89 Ditka jersey.

You’re not walking around in a Ditka jersey and sweatpants until 9 p.m. You actually put on a sweater this Sunday. A sweater!\n23. You come across your team playing on television, see that they are winning, and then realize it’s a repeat from 1993 on NFL Classic.\n24. You’ve lost 6 pounds on the NFL Sadness Diet. Which just means you’re eating less guacamole and chips and going for a long walk instead of watching the second half.\n25. Plus, turns out gruel and sticks aren’t so fattening.\n26. You actually don’t mind those weekend emails from your crazy boss.\n27. Jets fans are looking down their noses at you. Jets fans!\n28. You wouldn’t mind if the baseball playoffs went until Christmas.\n29. Thank goodness hockey is here.\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com .
