They show commercials and brief clips of TV shows. They also display fares and allow riders to swipe their credit cards to pay.\nSurveys show that many passengers find the TVs annoying.\nThe move was announced as the 13,500 yellow taxis on the streets face increasing competition from ride-hailing apps like Uber.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:26:54.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
