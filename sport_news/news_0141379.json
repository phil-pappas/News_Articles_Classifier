Police said Smith was randomly selected for a secondary screening and became uncooperative with the process, telling a TSA agent that he had a bomb. No charges were filed. \nDuring the 2014 season, he received a nine-game suspension for what the league called violations of its policies on substance abuse and personal conduct. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:57:25.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
