(Auburn University photo) Paul Gattis | pgattis@al.com \nA legendary basketball player and a civil rights icon who now serves in Congress will be honored by Auburn University in December at the United Nations. \nCharles Barkley, who played at Auburn before becoming a perennial all-star in the NBA, will receive the International Qualify of Life Lifetime Achievement Award from the school's College of Human Sciences. \nJohn Lewis, an Alabama native and Georgia congressman who was among the leaders in the 1965 Bloody Sunday march from Selma to Montgomery as a peaceful demonstration for voting rights, will receive the IQLA Laureate Award. \nAccording to the announcement, Auburn's College of Human Sciences launched the IQLA program in 1994 as a way to recognize people and partnerships that have made significant and lasting contributions to individual, family and community well-being locally and around the world. \nBarkley was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006 and is an NBA analyst for TNT. \nBarkley is being recognized as well for giving back to the community, including Auburn. \nAccording to the announcement, among his gifts to Auburn is the Charles W. Barkley Endowed Professorship, which is designed to support underrepresented minority professors with superior credentials in teaching, research and service in their disciplines and a commitment to promoting diversity. Two professors hold the title every five years. \nLifetime Achievement is a special award given by the College of Human Sciences for distinguished individuals who have made outstanding contributions to Auburn University, the state of Alabama and beyond.

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for Lifetime Achievement. \n\"It is truly fitting in the year that we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act that we pay tribute to John Lewis, a transformational civil rights leader and public servant, whose sacrifices, suffering and courageous actions were instrumental in advancing the 'destiny of democracy' and the promotion of equal justice for all humankind,\" said June Henton, dean of the College of Human Sciences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:01:21.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
