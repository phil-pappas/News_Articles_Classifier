There are only 10 in service today.\nBombardier spokesperson Marc-André Lefebvre said production issues concerning electrical connectors on two streetcars under construction have delayed their delivery to the TTC.\n“In order to address this situation and to ensure that it continues to produce the highest quality vehicles, Bombardier estimates that it will now deliver, this year, four streetcars less than previously announced,” Lefebvre wrote in a statement.\nHe added that the company is adding a third daily shift of workers at its Thunder Bay, Ont. plant where the streetcars are produced in an attempt to speed up production.\nTTC staff says the few new streetcars they do have in service perform remarkably well.\nBut that’s not enough for TTC Chair Josh Colle.\n“They have let down the TTC, our customers, the good workers in Thunder Bay, and all Toronto residents,” Colle said in a news release. “We will not let Bombardier's incompetence hold our patient and loyal customers hostage. We will consider all legal and financial actions at our disposal to address this situation.\"\nThe TTC board will discuss the delayed delivery at its meeting on Oct. 28.\nPhotos A new Bombardier-made streetcar seen on Spadina Avenue July 29.
