The Delhi-born player, who has made a place for himself in the Test squad, now wants to become an ODI regular as well. Before the match at Green Park, Mishra last played an ODI against West Indies last year. \n\"It is a great feeling to come back into the ODI side and straightaway put up a good bowling performance,\" Mishra told BCCI.TV. \n\"From here on I would only look to better my performances if I get a chance in the forthcoming ODIs. I feel whenever you play for India you need to have self confidence. Irrespective of the fact that you are taking wickets or not; the most important thing is to bowl well and pitch the ball in the right areas. \n\"I believe I am bowling well at the moment and I am enjoying every bit of it. I am looking to take as many wickets as possible at the moment and bowl according to the match situation,\" he added. \nMishra did his bit for the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side as he picked up two wickets in his 10-over spell, giving away just 47 runs. The 32-year-old player said that he worked to a plan that worked well for him. \n\"I made a conscious effort to flight the ball and mix the deliveries. I didn't want the batsmen to settle and get used to a particular type of delivery. The aim was to keep mixing it up and I believe I was successful in it to some extent,\" he said. \nMishra cleaned up a dangerous-looking Amla (37) in the 24th over with a straight on faster one and the South African run-machine saw the ball brush his pads to crash on to the stumps. Mishra said that aiming at Amla's weakness was his target. \n\"We know that Hashim Amla plays a lot on the back foot. \nMy aim was to bowl a straight line to him and get the ball to brush his pads or get him out bowled. \n\"That is exactly what happened during the match. I tossed up a few to him and got the ball to spin. But then, after a lot of spinning deliveries I surprised him with my straighter one. He got beaten and I got him bowled,\" Mishra said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:42:47.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
