Miller had two assists and Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves for New York, which begins the year with title aspirations of its own. The Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy last season for the most points in the NHL, and then lost to Tampa Bay in seven games in the Eastern Conference final.\nCheered on by a sellout crowd of 22,104, with many dressed in their usual red jerseys, the Blackhawks raised the banner for the franchise's sixth NHL title during a colorful pregame ceremony. Fluorescent balls bounced around the seats and LED wristbands for the fans provided a synchronized lightshow during player introductions and highlight presentations.\n  Artemi Panarin scored in his first NHL game for Chicago. Teuvo Teravainen also scored, and Corey Crawford made 24 stops.\nThe banner had only been in the rafters for a short time when New York issued a stern reminder of the difficulty of repeating. Just 1:43 into the game, Miller passed to Lindberg for a beautiful one-timer for the rookie's first goal.\nAfter a wide-open Panarin responded for Chicago off a pass from Patrick Kane, the Rangers went ahead to stay on another one-timer — this one for Klein off a pass from fellow defenseman Keith Yandle. Stepan then made it 3-1 with 59 seconds left when he scored on a rebound off an odd-man rush.\nCanadiens 3, Maple Leafs 1 • At Toronto, Carey Price made 36 saves and Montreal spoiled Mike Babcock's coaching debut with the Leafs.\nCanadiens captain Max Pacioretty scored on Montreal's first shot against Jonathan Bernier a few minutes in for the first goal of the NHL season. Alex Galchenyuk broke a tie midway through the third period, and Pacioretty added an empty-netter.\nJames van Riemsdyk had a power-play goal for Toronto early in the second period.\nBabcock made the first coach's challenge in NHL history and was successful in overturning a goal. Babcock challenged Jeff Petry's apparent goal in the second period, arguing that Tomas Plekanec interfered with goalie Jonathan Bernier. Referees Frederik L'Ecuyer and Dan O'Rourke looked at the replay by the penalty box at Air Canada Centre and determined Plekanec made incidental contact with Bernier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:16:32.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
