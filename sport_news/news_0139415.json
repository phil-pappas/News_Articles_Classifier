He later served as a South African cabinet minister and is currently a FIFA anti-racism adviser. The 62-year-old Sexwale is also a multi-millionaire businessman. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:22:33.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
