Murphy homered in a fourth consecutive playoff game, the first player to achieve the feat since Tampa Bay Rays third baseman Evan Longoria in 2008. \nFour of Murphy's homers this postseason came in 15 plate appearances against the three pitchers likely to finish first, second and third in the National League Cy Young Award race -- Arrieta, Los Angeles Dodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw and Dodgers right-hander Zack Greinke. The trio combined to face 2,603 batters this season and give up 39 homers. \nThird baseman David Wright hit an RBI double immediately before Murphy's homer, and Mets center fielder Yoenis Cespedes added an RBI single in the third. Right fielder Curtis Granderson scored two runs and stole two bases. \nSyndergaard allowed one run on three hits and one walk. He had a shutout until his final pitch, which Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant hit to deep center for an RBI double. \nFour Mets pitchers combined on 3 2/3 innings of two-hit ball, with right-hander Jeurys Familia earning his fourth postseason save with a one-hit ninth. \nBryant and center fielder Dexter Fowler each had two hits for the Cubs, who scored one run or fewer in consecutive games for the first time since Aug. 27-28. \nArrieta took the loss after allowing four runs on four hits and two walks while striking out eight over five innings. \nThe Mets raced out to a stunning 3-0 lead before Arrieta -- who allowed 21 runs in his previous 22 starts combined -- could record an out. Granderson singled and scored on Wright's double to deep center field. Murphy then homered to right field. \nGranderson helped preserve the lead in the second when he made a leaping catch to rob Cubs right fielder Chris Coghlan of a homer. \nIn the third, Granderson helped the Mets produce another run by drawing a leadoff walk, stealing second and third and scoring on an infield single by Cespedes. Arrieta intentionally walked Murphy to get to Cespedes, who hit 35 homers during the regular season. \nThe 4-0 deficit was the largest the Cubs faced with Arrieta on the mound since June 16, which was also the last time Arrieta failed to pitch beyond the fifth inning. \nNOTES: Mets INF Juan Uribe, who was left off the NL Division Series and NL Championship Series rosters due to a chest injury, fielded grounders during batting practice Sunday. It was his first baseball activity since aggravating the injury Sept. 25. ... Due to a death in the family, Mets LHP Jonathon Niese will travel home to Ohio on Monday's off day. He is expected to rejoin the Mets in Chicago on Tuesday. ... The Mets placed a \"Band-Aid\" on the Home Run Apple, which C Travis d'Arnaud hit with his solo shot Saturday. ... Cubs manager Joe Maddon said RHP Kyle Hendricks will start Game 3 on Tuesday. RHP Jason Hammel would start Game 4 as long as he is not needed in relief in Game 3. ... The Cubs won 97 regular-season games, the second most for a wild-card team that advanced to a league championship series. The 2002 Anaheim Angels won 99 games.
