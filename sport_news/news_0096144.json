Alabama went on to win the National Championship by beating Notre Dame in the BCS Championship Game. \nGeorgia hasn't beaten Alabama since 2007, when the Dawgs beat the Tide 26-23 in Tuscaloosa. \nAlabama leads the all-time series 37-25-4, although Georgia won three straight in the series in 2002, 2003 and 2007. The Tide have won the last two match-ups. \nAlabama also leads the series 14-10 in games played in Athens. The Tide are 12-8 all-time between the hedges at Sanford Stadium. The teams were 2-2 against each other in games played at Georgia's previous stadium, Herty Field. Sanford Stadium was opened in 1929. \nDawgs Road to SEC Championship Game Gets Easier With Win \nIf Georgia is to beat Alabama on Saturday, they'll face tough road games at Tennessee on October 10 and at Auburn on November 14. The Bulldogs will also play their cross-state rival Georgia Tech in a non-conference game on November 28. Georgia also has home games against Missouri, Florida, Kentucky at Georgia Southern. \nAlabama Still Faces Tough Road Even In Victory Over Dawgs \nAlabama, despite losing to Mississippi on September 19, is still ranked ahead of Georgia in this week's College Football Computer Composite Poll. Alabama is rated third. A panel will determine which four teams will play in the four-team College Football Playoff. Georgia is ranked 9th. \nIf Alabama wins on Saturday, they still face tough road games at Texas A&M, Mississippi State and Auburn.
