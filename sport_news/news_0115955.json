No little kid stuff. I couldn't cry. I couldn't complain.\n\"All I could do was accept the situation and come back as fast as I could.\"\nElliott returned for the final three regular-season games and the District 11 playoff loss to Easton.\nFour years later, Elliott made sure he showed due diligence in preparing for his final season at West Chester University, where he plays running back and wide receiver.\n\"You have to hold yourself accountable for the work you put in,\" he said.\nSo far, so good for the Elliott and the Rams, who take a 4-2 record (3-0 PSAC East) into Saturday's game against Shippensburg.\nElliott is averaging 10 yards per carry for 210 rushing yards and two touchdowns. He also has 17 catches for 284 yards for coach Bill Zwaan's club, which has rebounded from internal turmoil and two narrow losses to start the season by winning the last four by a combined 173-64 score.\nWest Chester dealt with situations involving two prominent players â€” Andy Derr, who was projected as the starting quarterback and tight end Tim Brown, a projected All-American.\nDerr is no longer a member of the team after two incidents involving alcohol and other drugs.\nBrown is back after missing two games while the NCAA sorted out his eligibility stemming from his course load last year.\nElliott has steered clear of any problems in an effort to keep the sport he's played since he was 7 years old in his life.\n\"It's hard to think about when football is not going to be part of me,\" the 5-foot-11, 185-pounder said.\nElliott said there is passion for the sport throughout his family. He gets a rush hearing his mom going crazy in the stands, finding out after games that his dad is proud of him and knowing his nephew wants to be just like him when he gets older.\nThe criminal justice major set a goal to be a state trooper when his football career ends.\nThe Bethlehem resident is hoping that day comes long after West Chester's season ends in November.\nParkland grad Jarel Elder also is contributing to the West Chester offense with a team-best 485 rushing yards and five TDs, plus 16 catches for 127 yards and one score.\nWest Chester, coming off a 44-14 rout of Kutztown, has dates left with rival Bloomsburg on Oct. 24 and East Stroudsburg on Nov. 7, both at home.\nTime for a turnaround : Like all other Centennial Conference teams, Muhlenberg had a bye last week.\nBut the Mules (3-2 overall, 2-2 CC) didn't get a free pass from coach Mike Donnelly on their first-half performance in 2015.\nDonnelly thought his team would have progressed more even though he is relying on a slew of first-year starters.\n\"We're trying to polish and get better at our trade,\" he said after Muhlenberg rallied to beat Susquehanna. \"We're making a lot of mistakes that we shouldn't be making.\"\nThe Mules are playing only three seniors on each side of the ball, but Donnelly expects improvement coming out of the bye week.\n\"Our kids are still struggling with assignments and being up to speed with their assignments against different coverages,\" Donnelly added.\nMuhlenberg visits unbeaten Gettysburg (5-0, 4-0) on Saturday in a battle of similar styles. The Bullets are hitting the meat of their schedule. Their conference wins are over the bottom four in the standings with a combined 2-14 record. Coach Barry Streeter's club's final four games are against foes with a combined 14-6 conference mark.\nSaucon Valley High grad Nick Savant will play Saturday. He left the Susquehanna game after his first carry of the second half with concussion-like symptoms.\nSavant, who has 329 rushing yards and four TDs, missed all but one half of one game last year because of a foot injury.\nSick Soltes : ESU quarterback Matt Soltes has put up video games-like stats the last two weeks.\nThe redshirt senior was named PSAC East offensive player of the week for his performance in the Warriors' 69-7 win Saturday at Cheyney.\nSoltes was 28-for-37 for 419 yards and seven touchdowns in three quarters. He was 19-for-27 for 276 yards and five TDs in the first half.\nSoltes earned his ninth career PSAC East Player of the Week award to tie quarterback Jimmy Terwilliger (2003-06) for the most weekly awards in school history.\nSoltes has 16 TD passes the last two games, the most in PSAC history. Through six games, he is 153-for-272 for 2,348 yards, 27 TDs and six interceptions.\nUp next: Millersville, which is third in the PSAC in passing defense, but next-to-last in rushing defense and scoring defense.\nthousenick@mcall.com\nTwitter @TomHousenick\n610-820-6651\nSATURDAY'S SLATE\nMuhlenberg at Gettysburg, 1 p.m.\nMoravian at Susquehanna, 1\nKutztown at Bloomsburg, 2\nMillersville at East Stroudsburg, 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:34:20.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
