Three separate Bills have been moved by the opposition National Conference, CPM MLA Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami and Independent MLA from Langate Abdul Rashid Sheikh in the Legislative Assembly on beef ban. However, it is not yet official that Speaker Kavinder Gupta would admit the controversial Bills as the coalition partners PDP and BJP share divergent views on the issue. Deputy Speaker Nazir Ahmad Khan though said the House belonged to all the members and it would be up to the House to decide on any issue. Sources, meanwhile, said the controversial anti-beef ban Bill would come up in the state Assembly on October 8. In all, 14 Private Members Bills are expected to come up during the session, sources said. The National Conference has moved the Bill through senior leaders and former ministers Ali Mohammad Sagar, Mian Altaf Ahmad and Mohammad Akbar Lone. NC general secretary Ali Mohammad Sagar told The Tribune that technically there was nothing wrong in the Bill on beef ban. “It is up to the Speaker to decide whether he belongs to all the members or the BJP,” Sagar said. “We are law makers and if they stop us there is no purpose…,” he commented. The session would begin with the obituary references in both the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council tomorrow. Those figuring in the obituary references include former President of India APJ Abdul Kalam, former ministers and members of the state legislature Ghulam Rasool Kar, GM Mir Poonchi and former secretary of the Assembly Mian Jalaluddin. Ahead of the session, all the major political groups, including the ruling PDP and the BJP, held meetings of their respective legislature parties. NC legislators met here on Thursday under the chairmanship of party president Farooq Abdullah, while the Congress party met here this evening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:32:31.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
