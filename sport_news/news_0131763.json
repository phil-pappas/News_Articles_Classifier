I’ve al \nready gotten text messages from friends in Arkansas. It will be fun. \n“I’m sure at some point the emotions will hit that ‘that’s my old team over there.’ My roots go deep at UCA. I remember sitting in classrooms with good teachers, then coaching the Bears and going to so many events. I met my wife there. Last year (a 53-35 upset victory over the Bears in Plano, Texas), it was tough. But you prepare a team each week to play the same way, regardless of who is on the other sideline. It’s not anything you can control.” \nCollums, in his 11th season at ACU, is looking at the big picture. \n“Our players don’t care I went to school and I don’t think the Bears care either. It’s not about me. The focus should be on the players. I am looking forward to going back to a place that has an unbelievable environment for football.” \nIn last season’s game, UCA hurt itself with five turnovers. ACU, in its second seson in NCAA Division I FCS and ineligible for a conference championship during the full transition, has prided itself as being one of the national leaders in turnover margin in both levels of competition. “It comes down to execution and avoiding turnovers,” said UCA coach Steve Campbell. “We have worked hard in eliminating mistakes. They are too good of a team to not give them anything.” \nSophomore Hayden Hildebrand, who passed for 201 yards and three touchdowns last week in a 49-21 victory over Northwestern State in relief of senior Taylor Reed (shoulder injury), will make his first start at UCA. \nCollums knows a lot about that situation. He took over at quarterback for the Bears his freshman season and helped spark an NAIA title run. \n“UCA has always had good quarterbacks,” Collums said. “I didn’t see much dropoff last week when Hildebrand was in the game; the guy’s a competitor. Nathan Brown (former UCA quarterback and offensive coordinator) does a good job of matching his quarterbacks to their skill set and allowing them to do what they do best. When they use different quarterbacks, they do it the right way.” \nSaturday is the beginning of five home games during the final eight regular-season games for the Bears.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:55:55.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
