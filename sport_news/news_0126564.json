(Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Carroll County Times Maryland's Edsall amid job status rumors: \"I'm just more worried about playing Ohio State.\" \nAfter two straight blowout defeats and amid a report that his firing is imminent, Maryland coach Randy Edsall reiterated comments he made earlier in the week ahead of Saturday's matchup at No. 1 Ohio State. \n\"The only reaction that I have to anything is what I said on Tuesday,\" Edsall said during a conference call with reporters Thursday. \"My whole focus and concern is working with our student-athletes and making them the best people, best students, best athletes that we can be. That's all I'm worried about. I don't read anything, see anything and I'm just more worried about playing Ohio State.\" \nEarlier Thursday, Maryland released a statement that Edsall would coach Saturday's game in Columbus, Ohio, after 247sports.com reported that he will be fired after the game. \n\"Randy Edsall is our head football coach and he'll be on the sidelines Saturday against Ohio State,\" a school spokesman said. \nSources familiar with athletic director Kevin Anderson's thinking believe that he hasn't made up his mind on Edsall's fate, but the outcome of Saturday's game could influence his decision on whether to fire him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:04:53.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
