To say we are “last” is not understanding the subject matter, nor is it asking the fans that have been to our venue over the past two seasons anything about their experience,\" said Brian Himstedt, Senior Director-Information Systems for the Royals.\nHimstedt also says that Sprint, which has a major investment at Kauffman Stadium, is ranked well. The other three carriers, which are not sponsors, are ranked poorly. That, Himstedt says, is the reason the Royals rated last.\n\"Carriers choose their investments market by market, and there is only so much influence we have on the level of investment they make in Kansas City vs. another metro area.  Obviously, we will make the continue to work with MLB and all the carriers to bring the best overall experience to our fans point,\" Himstedt said.\nAccording to the report, Verizon was the highest ranking carrier overall, winning or sharing the overall award at 15 of the MLB stadiums.\nThe report also stated that Pittsburgh’s PNC Park was the top-ranked stadium among the nine U.S. postseason teams, finishing sixth.\nClick here to find out more on specifics about Kauffman Stadium in the report.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
