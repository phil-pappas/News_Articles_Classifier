Those penalties hurt Texas' chances against Oklahoma State. None hurt worst than a late-game defensive holding call on defensive tackle Poona Ford, which caused head coach Charlie Strong to get angry with a referee resulting in an unsportsmanlike penalty.\n\"These were phantom calls, these were bogus calls,\" King said. \"Defensive holding on a guy who got pushed 10 yards down the field? ... This is ridiculous. Something needs to be done. This wasn't incompetence, to me, this was borderline fixing a game.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/video/mad-king-ridiculous-wronging-texas-213941986.html?format=embed", "http://sports.yahoo.com/video/mad-king-ridiculous-wronging-texas-213941986.html", "https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-09-29T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:35:42.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
