They return seven seniors who accounted for every start and most of the significant bench minutes \n\"Almost every player has improved their skill set,\" coach Frank Haith said Wednesday. \"I think you will see us shoot the ball much better and the offensive flow will be better.\" \nHaith pointed to senior point guard Shaquille Harrison, the second leading returning scorer at 13.1 points per game. He has raised the release point on his jumper dramatically in an attempt to elevate his 23 percent 3-point shooting. \n\"You just don't see guys making a dramatic change like that this late in their career, but Shaq has worked really hard on it and is shooting much better.\" \nJames Woodard, the team's leading scorer at 14.5 and the man who accounted for 88 of the team's 188 3-pointers last season, has been working on becoming a more relentless penetrator who gets to the line far more often. D'Andre Wright, the 6-foot-9 center who was one of the team's most talented but least productive players the past two years — averaging 7.0 points and 4.0 rebounds last season — spent the summer with a traveling Athletes In Action team in the Phillippines. \n\"I've seen a real difference in him,\" Haith said. \"More confident, more assertive. He's 6-10, 245 and can jump out of the gym. In order for us to get where we want to be, we need him, Rashad Smith and (backup center) Brandon (Swannegan) to take the next step. \n\"Marquel Curtis is shooting the ball much better, as is Smith. Rashad had to make the toughest adjustment last year, going from playing underneath to facing the basket on the wing. He's much more comfortable now. Brandon has come a long ways with his jump hooks and post moves. \n\"Last year at the end we were getting great execution but just not making anything. It was frustrating for the coaching staff, because we knew we were running the right stuff. The guys realized they just needed to get in the gym and work on their shots. We track everything in practice and we're shooting at a much higher level now than we did at any point last year.\" \nJunior college transfer Pat Birt and freshman point guard Sterling Taplin are expected to ease the 3-point drought. Only Woodard and guard Rashad Ray shot better than 30 percent from outside the arc. \nTulsa will need to execute at a high level with a daunting schedule that includes an early home date with Wichita State on Nov. 17, a game at Oklahoma State on Dec. 2 and a neutral-site game against Oregon State on Dec. 19. \nWith its veteran core, Tulsa would seem poised to make a run at the American championship and an NCAA Tournament berth (it lost in the second round of the NIT a year ago). Haith, who coached seven seniors four years ago at Missouri, said this group should avoid any cases of \"senioritis.\" \n\"You can have guys look at it as this is their last time to shine and then you have individualism,\" Haith said. \"Or you can have guys who are all about team. ... We have a team that really loves each other and pulls for each other. It's a good characteristic to have.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:24:41.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
