The kids are more hyped up in practice as opposed to being down after a loss.”\nTewksbury (4-0) has made the move from MVC Small to Large without a hiccup so far. A victory tomorrow would all but clinch the Large title for the Redmen. The smooth transition doesn’t come as a surprise to Central Catholic coach Chuck Adamopoulos, who touted Tewksbury as far back as August.\n“They’re always very well-coached and their kids play tough,” Adamopoulos said. “Another big factor is that their coaching staff has pretty much been together for a long time so you have that continuity.”\nCentral Catholic (3-1) comes off a 24-0 victory over Everett. Wide receiver Steven Jackson continues to be the big-play man for the Raiders, while sophomore Bret Edwards has done a terrific job at quarterback in replacing three-year starter Mike Milano.\nTewksbury has an experience edge at quarterback with Brett Morris. Troy Carey has blossomed into a workhorse, while wide receiver Adam Gajjaoui provides balance on offense.\nElsewhere tomorrow, several key league encounters dot the slate. The biggest matchups are Marblehead vs. Beverly (noon at Endicott), North Reading at Pentucket (1 p.m.), Walpole at Wellesley (1 p.m.), Plymouth North at Duxbury (4 p.m.), Lawrence Academy at Milton Academy (1 p.m.) and BB &N at Governor’s Academy (1:30 p.m.).\nThe best nonleague game takes place at the Hawk Bowl (1:30) where No. 1 Xaverian puts its 16-game winning streak on the line against Brockton .\nThe other team with a 16-game unbeaten streak is Marshfield and the Rams host undefeated Falmouth (7) tonight. Two other pivotal league contests tonight are Billerica at North Andover (7) and Bridgewater-Raynham at Dartmouth (7).\nWoburn coach Rocky Nelson is gunning his 200th win when the Tanners travel to Arlington (7).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:00:34.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
