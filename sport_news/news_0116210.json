(AP) - Colorado and Oregon State play on Saturday night with each team hoping to avoid the Pac-12 basement. The two are the last remaining teams without a win in league play. The Buffaloes have a streak of 14 straight Pac-12 losses dating back to September 2012 when they edged Washington State 35-34. Both sides are looking at this meeting as a \"winnable\" game. Oregon State is slightly favored at Reser Stadium, but not by much. \nSEATTLE (AP) - The Seattle Mariners have hired former major league catcher Scott Servais as their manager. New Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto made the announcement Friday. Servais replaces Lloyd McClendon, who was let go earlier this month. The 48-year-old doesn't have any managerial experience. He worked the past five seasons as an assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Angels, alongside Dipoto for most of that time. Dipoto resigned as the Angels' GM on July 1. \n(AP) -- The Arizona Wildcats host Washington State today at 1 p.m. for homecoming. The Wildcats are coming off a 38-31 victory against Colorado. Washington State hopes to continue its two-game winning streak that includes a victory over Oregon in Eugene. \nSANTA CLARA, Calif.
