Youth baseball coach and trainer, Bud Maddux, coach and teacher at Dunbar and Lufkin High schools, the late Oscar Kennedy, Sr. \nJermichael Finley participated in multiple sports at Diboll which included football, basketball and track. He was heavily recruited by several Division I schools and chose the University of Texas. After an outstanding college career as a tight end for the Longhorns, he was drafted in the third round of the 2008 NFL Draft (91st pick overall) by the Green Bay Packers and played six years in the NFL with 223 receptions for over 2700 yards and 20 touchdowns. \nBud Maddux graduated from Lufkin High School and attended college at North Texas and Victoria. With his love for baseball, Bud began coaching in 1974 in the Lufkin Youth Baseball program. Winning his first World Series in 1977, he has been at the helm of 10 champion World Series Teams. Bud still coaches a 12-year old select team, today.
