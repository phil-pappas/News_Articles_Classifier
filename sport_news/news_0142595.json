Albia erased a three-point deficit on the Indians since last week, based largely on the fact that Spirit Lake had to rally from a late 11-point deficit to edge Sioux Center, 41-38, Friday night. Albia, meanwhile, blasted Davis County, 50-0, for its sixth straight lopsided victory. \nAlbia received four first-place votes, Spirit Lake three. South Tama got the other one. \nRanked third and fourth in the preseason poll, Spirit Lake and Albia were co-No. 1s after Week 2. Spirit Lake held the advantage the next three weeks, and now they're even again with 73 points apiece. \nThe top teams in the other classes remain the same. It's West Des Moines Dowling in Class 4A, Pella in 3A, Iowa City Regina in 1A, BGM in Class A and Newell-Fonda in 8-Player. \nPella and Regina remain unanimous No. 1s in their respective classes for the seventh consecutive week this season. \nChange is minimal in the top two classes after the top 10 in each won Friday. \nDowling is followed by Bettendorf, West Des Moines Valley, Cedar Rapids Kennedy and Cedar Rapids Washington. Pella is pursued by West Delaware, Cedar Rapids Xavier, Dallas Center-Grimes and Webster City. \nSix Gazette-area teams remain in the 2A top 10, and four of them play each other Friday — No. 5 Williamsburg will host No. 3 South Tama, and No. 4 Anamosa will be at No. 6 Mount Vernon. \nRegina is followed by Dike-New Hartford and West Branch in 1A. DNH will play at No. 6 South Winneshiek on Friday. Alburnett debuts in the 1A rankings this week at No. 7. \nBGM claimed seven of eight first-place votes in Class A. Algona Garrigan is second, Denver third. \nDon Bosco cut into Newell-Fonda's 8-Player lead after routing then-No. 6 HLV on Friday and is a solid No. 2. Newell-Fonda has a difficult test this week, at home against unbeaten Exira/Elk Horn-Kimballton. \nGAZETTE/KCRG/KGYM FOOTBALL POLL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:07:50.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
