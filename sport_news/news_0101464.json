Walsh ran for three touchdowns and passed for two more scores to help No. 14 Oklahoma State beat Kansas 58-10 on Saturday, hours after a fatal crash near the stadium during homecoming festivities. \nFour people — including a toddler — were killed and dozens injured when a woman suspected of driving under the influence plowed a car into a crowd at the homecoming parade. Oklahoma State considered postponing the game, but in the end, opted to go ahead with it. \nThe flag at Boone Pickens Stadium was lowered to half-staff and Cowboys players knelt down on the field and prayed before the coin toss. \nMason Rudolph completed 20 of 26 passes for 305 yards and had a touchdown for Oklahoma State (7-0, 4-0 Big 12). Kansas (0-7, 0-4) lost its 10th straight game and 36th in a row on the road. \nNO. 2 BAYLOR 45, IOWA STATE 27 \nWACO, Texas (AP) — Shock Linwood ran for 171 yards and a touchdown, caught a pass for another score and Baylor beat Iowa State for its FBS-best 20th consecutive home victory. \nOn a rainy day along the Brazos River, the Bears (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) were held under 60 points for the first time in six games. The only other NCAA team with five straight 60-point games was Oklahoma in 2008. \nCorey Coleman had two more touchdown catches, his sixth consecutive game with multiple scores, to push his FBS-leading total to 18. He broke Kendall Wright's school record for career touchdowns with his 31st. \nColeman had a 36-yard score on Baylor's opening drive, then had a downfield block that helped quarterback Seth Russell break free on a 37-yard TD run for a quick 14-0 lead. Coleman caught a 12-yarder from Jarrett Stidham in the closing minutes. \nRussell fractured one of the bones in his neck on a 4-yard run without about 5 1/2 minutes left. The fracture was revealed on postgame X-rays and a CT scan. He will see a specialist next week. \nMike Warren ran for 145 yards on 28 carries for Iowa State (2-5, 1-3). \nNO. 6 CLEMSON 58, MIAMI 0 \nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Deshaun Watson threw a touchdown pass and ran for another score to help Clemson hand Miami its worst loss in the program's 90-year history. \nWayne Gallman ran for 118 yards and a touchdown for the Tigers (7-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). \nStacy Coley had eight catches for 54 yards for Miami (4-3, 1-2), in a game that could doom whatever chance Hurricanes coach Al Golden had of keeping his job much longer. \nUntil Saturday, the worst loss in Miami history was a 70-14 defeat to Texas A&M on Dec. 8, 1944. It was Clemson's largest win over an FBS opponent since an 82-24 victory over Wake Forest on Oct. 31, 1981. \nNO. 7 MICHIGAN STATE 52, INDIANA 26 \nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Connor Cook threw for 398 yards and four touchdowns for Michigan State. \nCook fell just short of the school record of 400 yards passing, set by Bill Burke in 1999 against Michigan. The Spartans (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) never trailed in the second half, but it was touch and go until Cook found R.J. Shelton for a 10-yard touchdown pass with 4:57 left for a 12-point lead. \nThe Spartans then tacked on two more touchdowns to avoid an upset a week after their unforgettable win at Michigan. Michigan State has won 12 in a row for the first time since 1956. The run matches the third-longest winning streak in school history. \nIndiana (4-4, 0-4) was outscored 24-0 in the fourth quarter. \nNO. 8 ALABAMA 19, TENNESSEE 14 \nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Derrick Henry had a 14-yard touchdown run with 2:24 left to lift Alabama past Tennessee. \nAlabama's aggressive defense then made two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Joshua Dobbs to preserve the victory. \nAlabama (7-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) got plenty of help, with Tennessee (3-4, 1-3) missing three long field goals. \nThe Vols took the lead on Jalen Hurd's 12-yard run with 5:49 left. Alabama overwhelmed the 15-point underdogs from there. \nNO. 17 OKLAHOMA 63, TEXAS TECH 27 \nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Samaje Perine ran for 201 yards and four touchdowns and helped Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield top his old team. \nMayfield transferred from Texas Tech after his freshman season in 2013 and had to sit out last year because the school blocked him from playing right away. \nMayfield completed 15 of 22 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns. Joe Mixon ran for 154 yards and two scores, and the Sooners (6-1, 3-1 Big 12) ran for 405 yards. \nTexas Tech's Patrick Mahomes passed for 233 yards and ran for 58, but threw four interceptions. DeAndre Washington ran for 94 yards and a touchdown for the Red Raiders (5-3, 2-3). \nNO. 19 TOLEDO 51, MASSACHUSETTS 35 \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — Phillip Ely threw four of his five touchdown passes in the second half Toledo overcame an 18-point deficit to beat Massachusetts. \nEly completed 26 of 47 passes for 355 yards, with three interceptions in the first half. The Rockets (7-0, 4-0 Mid-American) are off to their best start since 1997. \nTerry Swanson ran 21 times for 117 yards and a score for the Rockets. \nBlake Frohnapfel completed 27 of 49 for 240 yards and four touchdowns for UMass (1-6, 0-3). \nNO. 21 HOUSTON 59, UCF 10 \nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Kenneth Farrow ran for 167 yards and three touchdowns and Houston beat Central Florida to remained undefeated. \nThe Cougars (7-0, 4-0 American Athletic) scored 24 points in a mid-game span of 3 1/2 minutes and won for the fifth time by 21 points or more. \nHouston cornerback Brandon Wilson scored on an 85-yard fumble return on the third play of the game. \nFarrow's 26-yard touchdown run gave Houston the lead with 2:26 left in the half, and interceptions by William Jackson III and Donald Gage set up a touchdown and a field goal in the final 50 seconds. \nThe Golden Knights (0-8, 0-4) had four turnovers and gained only 105 yards after the first quarter. \nNO. 23 DUKE 45, VIRGINIA TECH 43, 4OT \nBLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) — Thomas Sirk threw four touchdown passes and ran for a 2-point conversion in the fourth overtime to lift Duke past Virginia Tech. \nSirk hit Erich Schneider with a 25-yard scoring pass on the first play of the fourth overtime, after the Hokies had scored and missed the mandatory 2-point attempt. Sirk rolled right and cut upfield, giving the Blue Devils (6-1, 3-0) the victory in the longest game in Atlantic Coast Conference history. \nVirginia Tech (3-5, 1-3) lost for the fourth time in five games, and for the third time this season at home. The Hokies, getting the ball first in the fourth extra period, seemed in good shape to either win or extend it, but after Travon McMillians's 1-yard touchdown run, Michael Brewer's 2-point conversion pass to Isaiah Ford was broken up by Deondre Singleton just inside the goal line. \nNO. 25 PITTSBURGH 23, SYRACUSE 20 \nSYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) — A fake punt for a first down helped set up Chris Blewitt's 25-yard field goal on the final play of the game in Pittsburgh's victory over Syracuse. \nThe Panthers (6-1, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) have won four of five on the road, with their only loss at Iowa on a 57-yard field goal on the final play. Syracuse (3-4, 1-2) has lost four straight. \nWith the score at 20-all, Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi called for a fake punt on fourth down near midfield. Punter Ryan Winslow hit Matt Galambos for 12 yards and a first down. \nQadree Ollison ran for 98 yards and two touchdowns for the Panthers.
