With a brisk, cold wind in their faces, the Argos began playing as if their brains had frozen stiff.\nTrevor Harris was a poor imitation of the quarterback that the Argos have come to expect.\nFirst, he threw an ugly interception on the first series into the wind that led to a touchdown. Then in the third quarter, Harris threw another pick with the wind to kill a drive in Calgary’s territory.\nThis was not all his fault. There was a strange play call by the Argos, who declined going for a field goal on a third and three on the Calgary 25. Harris’s pass was deflected. The Argos were trying to make a game of this and trailed only 17-7 at the time.\nHarris was picked off for a third time with a minute left in the game.\nThis was the eighth straight game Harris has thrown a pick and he has thrown a CFL worst 16 interceptions this season, although he also leads the league with 30 TD passes.\nHarris was overthrowing receivers, underthrowing them and throwing behind them. When he did find the mark, the passes were dropped.\nOver the past few games, his receivers have been making Harris look good.\nTwo weeks ago, it was Chad Owens making a circus catch and on Saturday it was Tori Gurley making a sprawling, seven-yard TD catch that was reviewed to see if he had his hands under the ball when he landed.\nHarris was so out of sorts that by halftime, with Calgary ahead 17-0, he was seven of 16 for 66 yards. This is a quarterback who went into the game leading the league with a 71.9 completion percentage.\nHarris has yet to prove he can be a bad-weather player. Against the wind, he threw the interception. With the wind, he was letting the ball sail on him.\nFor Friday, the early forecast is for mostly clear skies and a temperature of 11C in Hamilton. That may be the best news yet for Harris and the Argos.\nOf course, the Argos may decide that it’s time to give veteran Ricky Ray his first start of the season.\nEven if he comes on in a relief role, it would be great timing to see Ray go against Montreal’s Kevin Glenn in a battle of old-time warriors.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:00:16.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
