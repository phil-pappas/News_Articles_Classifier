First quarter 3rd and 1 Rashad Jennings clearly gets the first down, Tirico says it live, the ref spotting the play walks down the line clearly in first down territory. The other ref then spots the ball almost a full yard short! They go for it on 4th down(no challenge) the Eagles stuff them and take over on downs. The Giants stop them but the punt pins them deep leading to a pick six by Eli Manning. It wasn't just that the spot was short, it was nearly a full yard short. Last drive Unga the linebacker coming up to make a play is literally grabbed by 76 who hangs on spins and throws him down after the play. The ref standing right there throws the flag right at 76. The guy with the mic comes in and says DEFENSIVE holding 71. Wtf? THere is no 71 on the Giants defense, and the call was OFFENSIVE holding. So the refs convene just like the State Farm commercial where they don't know the mic is on, and eventually agree and pick up the flag saying there is no call. Well there was, you just blew it and then declined to make the right call. Without the 10 yard loss the Eagles wind up with a FG that included the refs screwing up starting the clock after the above mentioned mistake. Unreal how bad NFL refs can be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:23:33.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
