Toups, Jr., showed up at Cobbâ€™s Trailer Park to check on a female friend he had promised to drive to the St. Amant's Homecoming dance. According to APSO, he was approached by the girl's stepsister, who had threatened to stab him earlier in the week.\nSheriff Wiley said three witnesses watched as the stepsister's 16-year-old boyfriend grabbed a steak knife from the kitchen and stabbed 18-year-old Toups to death.\n\"At some point Todd says playfully and innocently, 'Well are you going to stab me?'\" said Wiley. Because the other little girl had told him that her sister had said \"she doesn't like you and she even said was gonna stab you if you hurt me.'\n\"And she [the stepsister] said, 'Well maybe I will.' But the boyfriend comes from around the corner and says 'If she won't, I will.'\"\nSheriff Wiley said this was not just a fight that got out of hand.\n\"[The suspect] takes the steak knife like this, and starts jabbing at our victim. Jabbing at him. Not 'I'm afraid of you, I want to leave, don't hurt me,'\" said Wiley. \"'I'm gonna hurt you,' and it was only when young Todd tried to defend himself, and tried to I guess diffuse the situation that we then get the fatal stabbing wound, the real stabbing wound.\"\nThe sheriff said investigators have no idea why the stepsister disliked Toups.\nHer 16-year-old boyfriend, who is accused of stabbing Toups, was charged with second-degree murder and was transported to Assumption Youth Detention Center with no bond.\nHe is set to go before a judge on Wednesday morning for a hearing to determine whether he will be transferred into an adult prison.\nThe district attorney and the sheriff say they are pushing to have him charged as an adult.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
