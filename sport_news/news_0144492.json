While Northeast (3-4 overall) has been a bit more consistent, West Creek's youth and struggles on both sides of the ball have made this season practically a wash with a 0-7 overall record. \nAll four local teams had a short week of practice and will play a rare Thursday night game this week. \nClarksville High will travel to take on Northeast at 7 p.m. Thursday in Wildcats coach Isaac Shelby's first trip back to The Eagles Nest since he left the program to take the job at Clarksville High two years ago. Meanwhile, Rossview will play host to West Creek, which is looking for its first win of the season. \nThe Wildcats are coming off back-to-back Region 7-5A losses but against two of the Midstate's top teams in eighth-ranked Henry County (28-0) and Centennial (42-5). Those losses dropped Clarksville to 2-2 in region play (5-2 overall). Under the new playoff format the top four teams in each region advance to the playoffs. Clarksville currently ranks fourth behind Henry County, Centennial and Brentwood, who all have not lost a region game.

(Photo: George Robinson/The Leaf-Chronicle) \nA win Thursday against Northeast and Clarksville High should maintain the status quo in the league standings as Centennial faces Brentwood Friday, which will produce a loss for one of those teams. \nRossview and Northeast right now are on the outside looking in as both the Hawks and Eagles are 1-3 in region play. To say these next few weeks are crucial would be an understatement. Rossview (4-3 overall) has two winnable games (one that includes Northeast) in these next three games, starting with the winless Coyotes Thursday, but the Hawks must face Centennial Oct. 23. Most of the teams in Montgomery County will have a bye week next Friday. \nNortheast faces West Creek in two weeks before finishing up with Rossview. Given the struggles that the Coyotes have had, the Eagles figure to be a favorite in that game. \nBoth Rossview and Northeast also would need some help. Northeast could do itself a huge favor by upsetting the Wildcats Thursday, but Clarksville also faces Dickson County Oct. 23 and will finish the season at Brentwood the day before Halloween. \nIt should make the final few weeks of the regular season in Region 7-5A very interesting. \nReach Prep writer George Robinson at 931-245-0747 and on Twitter @Cville_Sports. \nFRIDAY'S PREP FOOTBALL GAMES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:46:33.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
