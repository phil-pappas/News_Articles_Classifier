Their steady running game kept the ball out of Aberdeen's hands. Brooks said the Eagles only had the ball twice in the second half. \n\"I don't think we ever got the ball in the third quarter,\" Brooks said. \"They like to pound it and it just never ended for us, but that's the type of game they love to play. But we find it frustrating.\" \nThat playoff win by the Bobcats was their first over Aberdeen since 2009. During the regular season, the Eagles kicked a field goal in the final minutes to win. \nThe Bobcats, who have a handful of strong running backs, got two touchdowns from Hulse last week in a 17-6 win over C. Milton Wright. \n\"When we don't make mistakes, we are methodical about what we do,\" Huryk said. \"When we don't get little yellow hankies, it's four yards, four yards, four yards and that adds up to first downs.\" \nThe Eagles, a younger team than the Bobcats, also have struggled with penalties at times this season. They led 21-20 going into the fourth quarter against Fallston Friday night, thanks to throwing three interceptions that all led to Cougars touchdown. Aberdeen finally pulled away for a 42-28 win with Lyons gaining 225 total yards and scoring a touchdown and Everett adding 165 yards rushing and two touchdowns. \n\"We need to do what we like to do, which is run, throw, spread people out a little bit and try to get them away from just packing it in, everybody just grinding, grinding, grinding on you,\" Brooks said. \"So it's going to be a game of styles. Whichever style works is going to win.\" \nOTHER GAMES TO WATCH \nNo. 7 Archbishop Spalding at No. 1 Gilman, Friday, 3:30 p.m. \nDunbar at No. 12 Mervo, Friday, 6 p.m. \nRiver Hill at No. 14 Oakland Mills, Friday, 7 p.m. \nGlen Burnie at No. 10 Broadneck, Saturday, 12:45 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:47:01.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
