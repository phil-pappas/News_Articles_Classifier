Posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 6:00 am Historic turnaround for Cornjerkers BY CHAD DARE cdare@dancomnews.com Commercial-News.com \nHOOPESTON — Things were not looking very good for the Hoopeston Area soccer team just seven games into the season. \nThe Cornjerkers were coming off a 1-0 setback to the Watseka Warriors in the opening game of the Cornjerker Classic, dropping their record to 3-4 on the season. \nBut something changed that weekend for Hoopeston Area, who went on to win 14 of its next 15 leading into Saturday’s regional championship contest with those same Warriors, who had two wins this year over the Cornjerkers. \nThe turnaround was completed as Hoopeston Area claimed its third consecutive regional title with a 1-0 victory over Watseka at the Hoopeston Area soccer pitch on Saturday afternoon. \n“It’s been a heck of a ride,’’ Hoopeston Area coach John Klaber said. “From being 3-4 at the beginning of the year to now having 18 wins, which is tied for the most ever in our program’s history, along with an undefeated conference title is just remarkable.’’ \nHoopeston Area senior defender Nate Allison said that the team really didn’t make any major changes. \n“Really, it was just hard work in practice,’’ he said. “Klaber has been letting us watch motivational videos and we have just been way more aggressive.’’ \nThat was also the formula to success on Saturday. \nWith a wind howling between 15-30 mph from the north, the third-seeded Cornjerkers, as the lower seeded team, had the opportunity to call the opening coin toss. Hoopeston Area won it and immediate selected to have the wind at their backs in the first half. \n“I told our captains that if we won the toss, that we definitely wanted the wind,’’ Klaber said. “It’s much easier to play from ahead than it is from behind in a game like this and with these conditions.’’ \nIn those opening 40 minutes, Hoopeston Area missed on a handful of opportunities as Watseka keeper Tyler LaVoie made a couple of nice saves to keep the game scoreless. \n“We knew that we would not get a lot of chances and we needed to finish the ones that we got,’’ said Hoopeston Area junior Bailey Crose. \nFinally in the 37th minute, it was Crose hitting a perfectly placed shot in the upper right-hand corner of the goal giving the Cornjerkers a 1-0 lead. \n“That is by far the best shot of my life,’’ said Crose of his screamer from about 20 yards out. “I didn’t think I was going to be that open when I turned to the goal. I saw that I had a clear shot. The coaches have always told me that if I had a situation like that, fire away and keep it on frame. \n“Getting the lead before halftime was huge.’’ \nThe goal by Crose came just minutes after Watseka seemingly missed a wide-open goal when the ball bounced past Hoopeston Area keeper Trey Leyden. \n“It very easily could have been 1-0 in their favor,’’ Klaber said. “We always talk about this being a game of inches. This was one of those situations where the luck bounced our way.’’ \nIn the second half, Hoopeston Area, which had controlled the pace of action in the first 40 minutes, was put on the defensive. \n“Those last 40 minutes were the most nail biting I think I’ve seen,’’ Klaber said. “The wind played a huge factor.’’ \nBut the Cornjerker defense led by Allison thwarted away multiple scoring opportunities from the Warriors. \n“I was telling my defensive line that we had to be ready and be aggressive,’’ Allison said. “We had to mark our guys and understand what the wind was going to do.’’ \nWith the victory, Hoopeston Area advances to Iroquois West Sectional where it will play Beecher in a semifinal game at 7 p.m. on Tuesday.
