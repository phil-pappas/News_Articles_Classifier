About 5,000 people are expected to attend. The health fair \"absolutely has something for everyone 18 and over,\" said Kathy Amos, Tuolumne County Public Health nurse. \"Between the booths and screening information, I can't imagine a question that we can't answer, even if it's to refer you back to your medical provider.\" This year, Women of the Moose, who provide food for sale at the event, are going healthy, Amos said. “We will still have the traditional sandwiches for sale, plus salads, more fruits and vegetables, and no cookies, except at the blood draw,” Amos said. Also new this year, there will be no smoking allowed, Amos said. People will have to smoke (or vape) outside the fairgrounds, Amos said. “We had a lot of complaints the last couple of years that there was smoking at a health event,” Amos said. \"I'd really like to thank all the booth participants who donate their time to man a booth full-time for two days when they could be in practice at their business,\" Amos said. \"It's because of them that we are able to do this.\" Groups represented at the fair will include Home Health Services, Weight Watchers, California Department of Insurance, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and the Area 12 Agency on Aging are among others. More than 90 booths will be on site. The Veterans Administration services, Catholic Charities and Disability Resource Agency for Independent Living also will be there. Another booth will offer evaluation and referrals to medical professionals. Yoga and tai chi demonstrations also will be offered. An early-bird morning blood draw for people who have to work early. Draws begin at 5 a.m. both days. The regular blood draw runs from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. both days. People who don’t have to work early are encouraged to go after 7 a.m. Patients are asked to fast for 12 hours before the blood chemistry panel. Water and regular medications are OK. Blood test results will be mailed to participants two to three weeks after testing. People must take the results to their own doctors.
