That's what we've been putting our mind too. The girls have worked hard off season. In season, they were too determined to take it today. But Southern Lehigh's a tough team. We had to play our best today.\" \nA few young players who weren't around for that gym visit helped the Blue Eagles clinch the title on Saturday. \nSophomore Emma Haynes and freshman Jenn Soika rallied from a set down to earn a 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over Southern Lehigh's Keelin McLoughlin and Kelly Asselin at No. 2 doubles to give Nazareth the championship. \nIt was the first match Haynes and Soika ever played together. \n\"We were very nervous,\" Haynes said. \"In the first set, we were down and we were like, 'oh my God, we have to come back second set.' So we changed our game. I played more consistent. We both played more consistent. And I hit more of a slicer so it would dive in more.\" \nFreshman Halle DeNardo and junior Madison Stewart had a 6-2, 6-1 win at No. 1 doubles to keep their perfect record intact for the season. \n\"I think we played very well as a team,\" DeNardo said. \"Going into it, during warm ups, they were hitting pretty well. We were pretty nervous. The first game was tough. It was a long first game but once we pulled it out, the nerves starting going down.\" \nThe Blue Eagles also got some help as Southern Lehigh forfeited the No. 1 singles spot as two-time defending district champion Nina DeLuna is competing in a USTA junior national championship event in South Carolina. Junior Sydney DeNardo was credited with the forfeit victory for Nazareth. \nAlso key to Nazareth's success this season have been senior No. 2 player Alison Smith and senior third singles player Amber Achenbach . \nThe Spartans, who entered Saturday with no losses, got straight-set singles victories from Katie Cole and Naomi Li . \nNazareth will play against District 1 runner-up Conestoga in the first round of the state tournament at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Winning Touch Tennis in Allentown. \n\"It's just awesome,\" Van Buskirk said of the district title. \"We have a lot of depth in our tennis program at Nazareth. My JV coach Kathy Heller does a fantastic job with our feeder program in K through 8, also junior team tennis. And she does a tennis club for 7th and 8th grade. We have a feeder program coming in and that's what makes us good. Everybody working and basically just loving to be on the court and playing the game of tennis.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:15:22.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
