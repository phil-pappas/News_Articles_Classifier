Montevideo’s record this season is now 9-1. Montevideo scored the game’s first points late in the first quarter on a 21-yard touchdown pass from Troy Diggins to Bailey Eickhoff. Afumble recovery by Ethan Schmitt led to the score. A blocked punt by Connor Kontz put the ThunderHawks inside Holdingford’s 10-yard line and set up a touchdown pass from Diggins to Travis Dreyer. The extra point was missed and the Hawks were up 13-0. For more on this story and others pick up this weeks paper or subscribe today!
