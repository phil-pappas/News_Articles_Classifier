(Photo by Joel Ryan/Invision/AP) \nLONDON (AP) — David Beckham will play in a football match for the first time since retiring more than two years ago, with Alex Ferguson managing his former Manchester United star again. \nIn a UNICEF fundraising fixture on Nov. 14, the 40-year-old Beckham will captain a Britain and Ireland team against a world all-star side led by 1998 World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane and managed by Carlo Ancelotti. \nThe game is taking place at Old Trafford where Beckham became a global star under Ferguson before leaving in 2003. \nThe midfielder went on to captain England and play for Real Madrid, the Los Angeles Galaxy and AC Milan before ending his career at Paris Saint-Germain in May 2013. The same month, Ferguson retired from United as more than 26 years as manager.
