Daniel Leon Clifton, 35, pleaded guilty at a pretrial conference Monday in Tuolumne County Superior Court to one felony count of human trafficking, one felony count of making criminal threats and one felony count of possessing child pornography in excess of 600 images, Krieg said. The trial was originally set to begin Wednesday. Clifton, who was arrested Feb. 2 at his residence on the 500 block of Hampton Court, allegedly posed as a 17-year-old on a dating app for teenagers and engaged in a relationship with a 15-year-old girl from Tuolumne County. He was 32 when the relationship began, Krieg said. Clifton was originally charged with 20 felonies before accepting a plea agreement from the District Attorney’s Office. The agreement included a stipulated sentence of 21 years, four months in state prison, Krieg said. Clifton, who is in custody at Tuolumne County Jail, is due back in court for formal sentencing at 1:30 p.m. Oct. 26, in Department 1 of the historic Tuolumne County Courthouse on Yaney Avenue.
