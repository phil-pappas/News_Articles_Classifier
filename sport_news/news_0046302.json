Guy McCarthy / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Dallas and Keith Lisitsin work in East Sonora with hand tools, power-driven saws, sanders, a lathe, a router, a planer and a drill press to restore chairs, tables, benches and other furnishings from the 1970s back to more than a century ago. They say their aim is to recreate and respect the work of woodworkers and metalworkers from days gone by, people who put hand-made quality before profits to make original American designs that remain timeless. The Lisitsins opened their business, Unique Shop Artisans, on Via Este in Ranchos Poquitos in August. They plan to stage their grand opening Oct. 17. They say they can refinish, repurpose, restyle and repair all manner of home and business fixtures. Keith Lisitsin, 57, born in the Bay Area, says he’s been doing woodwork and shop since high school, and he’s honed his skills restoring items from jewelry boxes to furniture for the past 18 years. “We like working with wood,” Keith Lisitsin said Tuesday at the family shop. “The grain, the smell, especially cherry, the different types of textures. I can fix just about anything with wood, even if there’s only a little bit of it left. I can research and fill in the gaps and recreate it in full.” Respecting design The Lisitsins say they try to work exclusively with furnishings first made in the United States and England. “We work with solid wood and metal,” Dallas Lisitsin, 31, said. “We don’t do anything made in Taiwan, Japan or China. The quality of work in furniture, the quality is low unless you’re talking dynasty antiques. That’s why we call ourselves Unique Shop Artisans: USA.” Examples of furniture designs the Lisitsins like to work with include late 1800s arts and crafts, craftsman, to mid-century and modern, anywhere from the 1930s to the 1960s, in genres such as hand-made primitive, antique, vintage, retro and industrial. “My favorite is mid-century modern,” Dallas Lisitsin said. “Anything with a certain design flair to it. We really like Ethan Allen furniture from the 1950s and 60s, and older Keller furniture. Office furniture, industrial design is really popular right now.” Tools the Lisitsins work with can help reveal the intent of wood workers and metal workers who made the original furnishings. The drill press is set up to accept wire brushes for polishing metal. The planer helps smooth and resize flat-surface boards. At the router table they can add edge-work and ornamental details. The lathe can recreate arms and legs for chairs, couches, rockers and tables. ‘We prayed on it’ The Lisitsins say they took more than 30 pieces of restored furniture and other inventory to the Calaveras Grape Stomp and Street Faire in Murphys on Saturday, and they sold almost everything. “The only thing we didn’t sell was some antique decor, decanters and clocks,” Dallas Lisitsin said. “One lady liked our stuff so much she asked us to ship it to Michigan.” Dallas Lisitsin said he served in the Army for six years and was discharged in 2013. The Lisitsins have lived in the Sonora area before, and they returned five months ago. “We’ve always loved this place,” Dallas Lisitsin said. “We heard God calling us back. We prayed on it and decided to come.” The Lisitsins say they are Christians. Dallas and his wife attend Sierra Bible Church in Sonora. “Me and my wife are still looking for our church,” Keith Lisitsin said. “We’re not afraid to show our faith. We don’t try to push it in people’s faces. We just want people to know where we come from.” The Lisitsins say they promote Unique Shop Artisans on Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram and Twitter. “Some people know us by word-of-mouth, too,” Keith Lisitsin said. “The old-fashioned way.” The Lisitsins tout their business philosophy on their website. Part of it reads: “We believe that in business what separates good from great is the quality of craftsmanship and attention to detail mixed with style and hard work. We hold ourselves accountable for everything the comes in and out of our shop.” Unique Shop Artisans is at 16044 Via Este Suite B off Highway 108. The shop phone is 761-8284.
