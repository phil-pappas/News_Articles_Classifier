The 2011 fifth-round draft pick out of Pittsburgh was traded once, cut twice and spent the better part of two years out of the NFL recovering from a broken leg before joining the Patriots. And now he has a deal worth $3 million in base money and up to $5 million with incentives, according to the NFL Network.\nThe two sides have been perfect for each other, as Lewis’ 325 yards from scrimmage in three games have already eclipsed his career totals. Lewis, who turned 25 last month, has felt fortunate for the opportunity on the field and the new paycheck to go along with his success.\n“They gave me a chance,” Lewis said. “That’s all I can ask for. They gave me a chance, so it’s on me to repay them as well. They showed a commitment to me, and now I’ve got to honor that, keep going out there and making it right. They gave me a chance. That’s how I’ll repay them.”\nIt’s in Lewis’ nature to continue looking over his shoulder after a rough go of it with the Eagles, Browns and Colts, so he won’t look at the contract as a sign that he has made it.\n“Not at all,” Lewis said. “Anything can still happen, so just continue to do what I’ve been doing, come into work every day and just try to get better.”\nLewis has 30 carries for 146 yards and two touchdowns plus 15 receptions for 179 yards in three games after he didn’t crack the stat sheet in 2013 and 2014. He ranked third among running backs in yards from scrimmage through Week 3, so the guy whom Bills coach Rex Ryan claimed to be irrelevant has been one of the most productive players in the league at his position and now has some extra cash to show for it.\nBut again, Lewis wasn’t reveling.\n“I don’t have time to think about that right now,” Lewis said. “I’ve got a game to prepare for, got to get ready for a tough defense in a hostile environment. I don’t really have time to think about that. I’m just focused on taking it day by day and getting ready for this opponent.”\nLewis joined the Pats in December with a future contract, so he was a longshot to survive the offseason workout program, let alone roster cuts in September. But there’s been no denying his talent on the field, and his teammates have loved him in the locker room.\nEven though Lewis seemingly came out of nowhere, they recognized something special during training camp.\n“I’d be telling a couple of my friends all the time, ‘Man, this new guy we picked up, he can move,’ ” tight end Rob Gronkowski said. “His quickness and the way he makes guys miss is just unreal. I wish I could have those moves.”\nLewis was also appreciative of the praise.\n“It means a lot,” Lewis said. “My teammates trust me. My coaches trust me. All I can do to repay them is to come here and work hard every day and give them all I’ve got. It’s good that my teammates and coaches find me accountable.”\nThorn in his side\nRookie defensive end Trey Flowers ’ shoulder injury, which was first unveiled on Wednesday’s practice report, is related to the ailment that he suffered in the preseason opener against the Packers, according to a source. Flowers missed a week because of that injury in August.\nHowever, the source said the shoulder is “not a big concern.” Flowers aggravated the shoulder during practice and was listed as a limited participant for the past two workouts.\nFlowers had been listed as a full participant due to a knee injury since the start of the regular season, so Wednesday’s downgrade was viewed as a red flag.\nHardy har har\nCowboys defensive end Greg Hardy drew a wide range of reactions this week with a series of odd comments, including some personal remarks about Tom Brady ’s wife, Gisele Bundchen . However, the Cowboys ducked the comments until yesterday when coach Jason Garrett finally admitted they weren’t acceptable.\nKeep in mind, Garrett said Wednesday he didn’t “think it was anything” when the New England media asked about Hardy.\n“We addressed it immediately,” Garrett told Dallas reporters yesterday. “That’s not how we want to operate as an organization. The player and coaches in our organization understand that, and we want to distinguish ourselves with our play, not with what we say. We define ourselves by what we do, not by what we say. I think Greg understands that now, and that’s how we want to proceed going forward.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:41:23.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
