For several of them, it’s their third time winning this, so I’m so proud and so happy for them,” Lee said. \nComing off of a five-set victory over the Wildcats in the area tournament earlier in the week, the Trojans swept Trinity 25-14, 25-14, 25-9 in the finals. \nLed by outside hitter Clayton Waring, the lone senior, St. James went through the tournament without dropping a set. \n“She’s been great. Especially in this game, you could see how she really wanted it. She knew that this was in her last leg of her volleyball career,” Lee said. “You could tell it on her face, you could tell it in her actions, she wanted this one badly.” \nThe Trojans (30-8) defeated Andalusia 25-11, 25-13, 25-13 in the quarterfinals, and Satsuma 25-14, 25-22, 25-17 in the semifinals. \n“It feels good. This is our third one in a row. We’ve been working so hard, and we just decided that we were going to give it our all and put it all out there,” Waring said. “It’s definitely more emotional, realizing this is my last time doing all this. It’s been my life for so long, it’s just really emotional.” \nThe Wildcats (23-16) beat Straughn 25-18, 25-13, 25-18 in the quarterfinals and edged out UMS-Wright 28-16, 26-24, 20-25, 16-25, 17-15. \nSt. James and Trinity qualified for the Class 4A state tournament Wednesday and Thursday at the Birmingham CrossPlex. UMS-Wright and Satsuma also qualified. \nEven though St. James has just one senior, Lee is confident in her veteran group of seven juniors heading into the state tournament. \n“I feel great going into state, knowing that they’ve been there before. They’ve been through it, so they kind of know what to expect,” Lee said. \nEthan Bernal , who covers high school athletics for the Advertiser, can be reached by emailing him at ebernal@gannett.com or follow him on Twitter @EthanGBernal. 2 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1S3HMY3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:34:21.207+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
