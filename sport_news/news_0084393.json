It was one of those things. \n“We encourage our players and our goalkeeper to be brave and to take responsibility to play from the back. That is very much our philosophy. \n“There is no blame attached to Artur, he has been excellent since he came here. He has made very few errors but, unfortunately, it is the life of a goalkeeper. You are going to make mistakes,” he added. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:18:02.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
