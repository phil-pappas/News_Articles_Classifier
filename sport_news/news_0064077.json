When it’s football season in Wisconsin, there’s a noticeable change in the air.\nAdChoices Nowadays, Green Bay Packers fans are used to a certain level of excellence. On that front, they’ve undoubtedly been spoiled.\nI’m 26 years old and have lived here my whole life; from 1992 to the present, I’ve primarily been subjected to Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers playing under center.\nThey won their first Super Bowl in my lifetime in 1996, but I was only seven years old and could hardly appreciate it. By the time they won it again in 2010, I was able to grasp what it meant.\nIn the four seasons that have followed, the Packers have claimed the NFC North each time, but come playoff time, have fallen short.\nWe’re familiar with fan culture, so I’ll be brief here: people get angry. Very angry. As in, calling for people’s jobs level of anger.\nEnter Defensive Coordinator Dom Capers, Packers’ fans annual punching bag.\nCapers took over the defense in 2009; here’s how Green Bay has ranked in total defense since:\n2009 – 2nd\n2010 – 5th*\n2011 – 32nd\n2012 – 11th\n2013 – 25th\n2014 – 15th\n2015 – 9th**\n*Super Bowl Season\n**Through Week 4\nSix full seasons going on seven, four division titles, one Super Bowl, and based on those numbers, a hit-or-miss defense—though from 2011-2014, it’s certainly been more miss than hit.\nOh, and that second-ranked team defense in 2009, when they were fifth against the pass and first against the run? Kurt Warner managed to go 29-for-33 with 379 yards, five touchdowns, and no interceptions in a 51-45 overtime win in the wild card round that year. Beanie Wells rushed for 91 yards on 14 carries (6.5 YPC). Go figure.\nThe following year was a great success before they plummeted all the way to the bottom of the pack in 2011. This began a string of four consecutive seasons of less than ideal defense and early playoff exits.\nWhen they were bad (2011, 2013), they were really bad. And even when they weren’t that bad (2012, 2014), they didn’t quite boast a defense for which championship teams strive.\nSo, what’s gone on in 2015 thus far?\nFor starters, they’ve faced running backs Matt Forte, Marshawn Lynch, Jamaal Charles, and Carlos Hyde in consecutive weeks. Yardage wise, they allowed the following:\nForte – 24 carries, 141 yards (5.9 YPC)\nLynch – 15 carries, 41 yards (2.7 YPC)\nCharles – 11 carries, 49 yards (4.5 YPC)\nHyde – 8 carries, 20 yards (2.5 YPC)\nNot bad for a run defense that ranked 23rd last year, right? Well, that’s the interesting part: through four games, their run defense currently ranks 22nd despite giving up only 251 yards (62.8 YPG) to those four backs. 56 percent of that yardage came in Week 1 against Forte.\nWhat makes that ranking so low? Quarterbacks:\nCutler – 4 carries, 31 yards (7.8 YPC)\nWilson – 10 carries, 78 yards (7.8 YPC)\nSmith – 6 carries, 33 yards (5.5 YPC)\nKaepernick – 10 carries, 57 yards (5.7 YPC)\nAdd those numbers up, and suddenly it makes a little more sense: the Packers have allowed 450 rushing yards through four games, which comes out to 112.5 per game.\nPlus, look at those averages. Surrendering 4.8 YPC as a whole, Green Bay ranks third-worst in said category.\nDon’t let those numbers mislead you.\nWith the exception of Chicago, they’ve taken away their opponent’s run game by focusing on the pass. So far, so good; they rank eighth against it, limiting opponents to a 56.5 percent completion rate and only 197 yards per game.\nQuarterbacks like Wilson and Kaepernick, particularly the former, are always going to be able to make plays with their feet.\nAfter Kaepernick averaged roughly 140 yards on the ground in consecutive postseason contests against a Capers-led defense, Sunday’s victory will feel especially good for him and his unit as a whole, as they allowed a minimal total on the ground (comparatively) and racked up six sacks.\nLinebacker Clay Matthews has three on the season, as does 2012 first round pick Nick Perry—which already puts him one away from tying his career best. B.J. Raji, back from a season-ending injury last year, has been disruptive throughout while second-year safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix continues to come into his own. Green Bay is second in the league in sacks (17), with 13 coming in the past two weeks.\nPerhaps the most intriguing trait of this defense, however, is just how young they are.\nJulius Peppers, 35, is the senior leader, but after that the next oldest is Bret Goode (31), Matthews (29), Raji (29), and Sam Shields (28). The average age of their entire team is just 26 years old.\nSo, because of a handful of mobile quarterbacks, their numbers against the rush are a little inflated. They remain very solid against the pass, and most importantly, have only allowed 17.8 points per game—good for third-best in the league.\nYou know what else helps a defense? Not turning the ball over. Green Bay leads the league with only one giveaway through four games, despite only five takeaways (T-16th).\nFor the last four seasons, Packers fans have been wanting to see a defense capable of complementing their high-powered offense, potentially bringing home another championship. Through four weeks of the 2015 NFL season, Capers’ unit is well on their way to being just that.\nStatistics courtesy of ESPN and Pro Football Reference\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.pro-football-reference.com/", "http://espn.go.com/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:28:44.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
