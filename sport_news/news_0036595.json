The Bruins were 0-2 with 10 goals against (one into an empty net) before Monday's matinee against Tampa Bay, and many cited a young, inexperienced defense corps as a primary cause. Without veterans Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg, Nos. 1 and 2 on the defensive depth chart, this had to be expected, right? Well, Chara returned to the lineup against the Lightning on Monday, and performed pretty well for somebody who hadn't played a shift since a Sept. 24 preseason contest, or a full game since April. \"He made it look easy, for a guy that played … maybe a minute and a half in the preseason,\" coach Claude Julien said. \"He made things look easy because he kept his game simple and he made the right decisions.\" So how come the Bruins fell to 0-3 for the first time since 1999-2000, via a 6-3 loss at TD Garden? And why was Chara, who played 21 minutes, 27 seconds, a minus-2? Because forwards and goaltenders have a lot to say about keeping pucks out of the net, too, and their poor decisions left the defensemen — from Chara and his 1,196 career NHL games to Colin Miller, who played his second — on the ropes all day. And not for the first time this season, either. Turnovers at center ice gave the Lightning — who need no help to generate scoring opportunities — odd-man rushes that led to three goals. A botched handoff between Tuukka Rask and rookie defenseman Joe Morrow (18 NHL games), compounded by David Krejci's failure to skate it out of trouble, gave the Lightning another. The Bruins gave up two power-play goals, one after a penalty that resulted from a forward losing the puck in the defensive zone. All this after the most promising start of the young season, a 2-0 first-period lead built on power-play goals by Krejci and Loui Eriksson, both with assists from Torey Krug. The Bruins let the Lightning back in the game when fourth-line right wing Max Talbot didn't get a puck past defenseman Victor Hedman at the red line, starting a rush that led to the first of fourth-line winger Brian Boyle`s two goals. The visitors tied it when Rask (17 saves) let Ondrej Palat's power-play deflection go through his skates. David Pastrnak's turnover let Boyle score a breakaway goal for a 3-2 Lightning lead at 4:48 of the second. Eriksson's second power-play goal tied it, but the B's couldn't stay even for even three minutes: With Patrice Bergeron in the penalty box for hooking, Steven Stamkos struck for a go-ahead power-play goal (and 500th career point) at 15:17. Jonathan Drouin (Bergeron turnover) and Valtteri Filppula (Rask-Morrow-Krejci gaffe) put it out of reach in the third. \"Honestly, I don't even know what to say right now,\" said Krejci, who figured in all three Bruins goals. \"Sixteen goals in the last three games. That`s not how we pictured it. \"I'm not talking about just D (defensemen). It's all five, six guys on the ice. Somebody's going to make mistakes, (but) there's four or five other guys to make up for it. We didn't do that.\" They didn't do it against the Jets (a 6-2 loss on Thursday) or the Canadiens (a 4-2 loss on Saturday), either. Some goals in those games were more directly related to poor defensive zone coverage (which has already led to veteran Matt Irwin's demotion to AHL Providence), but the Bruins hurt themselves with terrible turnovers in those games, too. Rask, who expected and even welcomed the challenge of facing more scoring chances as the Bruins sought to increase their offense this season, has too rarely met that challenge. And he knows it. \"You have to make good saves at the right times,\" he said. \"Today, I made maybe two good saves at the beginning of the third, and that was it for the whole game. I had a chance to make a couple more. I didn't … I just have to get better than that, and we`ll be fine.\" Better goaltending will help, but as was proved by Chara's return, one player won`t be enough to reverse the Bruins' current course. \"At some point (on Monday), we stopped respecting the game plan,\" Chara said. \"You're going to be paying a price for that.\" By Mike Loftus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:24:55.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
