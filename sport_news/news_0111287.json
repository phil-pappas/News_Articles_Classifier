Olivia Bexten added three more aces later in the set and McKenzie Schulte had one as Calvary posted the 19-point win. \nAfter Calvary got a sideout on a serving error by MSD, Katie Goodin served the next 22 points — including 11 aces — to give the Lady Lions a great start to the second set. \nThe Lady Lions didn’t reset their serving lineup between games, and they finally got to their sixth different server by the final point of the match. Calvary ended up with 21 aces in the match. \n“They all did a good job,” Kueck said. \nThe final point ended on a kill by Bexten, as she ended up sharing the team lead in that category with Kyra Wiegers, as they had four apiece. Thompson, Goodin and Grace Smith had two each. Thompson led the team with six assists and Smith had five. \nWith the Eagles playing a bit of an unorthodox style, the Lady Lions had to be alert on defense in case the ball came over the net on the first or second hit. \n“The ball wasn’t hitting the floor — they were responding well and getting after it,” Kueck said. \nThe Lady Lions will now refocus before playing sixth-seeded Bunceton, an upset winner against third-seeded Smithton, at 5:45 p.m. today in the semifinals. \n“The girls were talking about going and doing something as a team (Monday night), because they knew that the game was what it was and they needed to get refocused together,” Kueck said. “(Today) will be a much tougher challenge and they’re excited to see how they’ll do.” \nWith a win in the semifinals, Calvary (23-5-1) would meet either top-seeded New Haven or fourth-seeded Chamois at 7 p.m. in the title match. Calvary lost to New Haven in last year’s district championship match. \n“I expect the girls, and they expect it, too, to be back in that match against New Haven,” Kueck said. “They expect to be able to compete with them and do well.” ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:09:50.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
