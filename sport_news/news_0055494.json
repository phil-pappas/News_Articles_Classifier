Dejected after the failure of cotton crop and meagre compensation offered by the government, the farmers did not allow Rural Development and Panchayat Minister Sikander Singh Maluka to speak at the concluding ceremony of Sant Baba Chitanand Kabaddi tournament at Alike village yesterday. Former sarpanch Jit Singh confirmed that the stadium witnessed a gathering of farmers from Maur (Nabha-Patiala), Dhilwan and Daraj villages. When the minister began his speech, the farmers started raising anti-government slogans and disrupted him. Maluka said: “Cheekan naal giddad darde, sher nahin (you can only scare away cowards, not the courageous)”. Villagers interfered and requested the agitating farmers to allow them to complete the proceedings. Farmers demanded a compensation of at least Rs40,000 per acre for their crop loss besides relief to families of farm labourers. Maluka said: “There was no farmer in the noisy crowd which comprised unruly mob, mostly youngsters, from adjoining villages. I ensured peace at the venue and spoke for at least 30 minutes to make my point”. Maluka announced a grant of Rs30 lakh for the village.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:16:39.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
