Speaking to mediapersons at a press conference organised today, the cotton ginners thanked the state government for reducing market fees on cotton from 2 per cent to 0.8 per cent, but said no clarity on refund of VAT was making business difficult for them. “Our members pay 4.20 per cent VAT while purchasing raw cotton against D-1 form, but when they sell it out of state; we receive merely 2.2 percent of it. However, the Excise and Taxation Department refuses to refund 2 per cent extra VAT paid by them,” said Sushil Mittal, president of the Haryana Cotton Ginners Association. Mittal said earlier the department used to refund the extra VAT paid by them, but it has been stopped from this year. He said the cotton industry was already under crisis with the availability of cotton for only 20 lakh bales against capacity of 40 lakh bales and if the government failed to refund their VAT they would have no option but to close their units. When contacted, IS Godara, Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner (DETC), Sirsa, said after incidents of frauds in refund of VAT against fake bills of cigarettes and cement the state government has amended the Haryana VAT Act. “The amendment in Schedule E of the Haryana VAT Act does not have any refund of VAT other then what the ginners get while selling their product against C-Form,” Godara said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:12:12.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
