He returned it 38 yards to lift the Spartans to a startling 27-23 victory.\nHe didn't have much chance to celebrate. The redshirt freshman appeared to land hard on his left hip after he was tackled into the end zone by Michigan tight end Jake Butt.\nJoyous teammates then jumped on Watts-Jackson as he lay on a maize \"M'' in the end zone. He was carted off the field and hospitalized.\n___\nAP College Football: www.collegefootball.ap.org\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
