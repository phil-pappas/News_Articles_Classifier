Without them working hard and working together, I don't think I'd be able to get those. But luckily I was able to finish them and score two goals.\" \nBates took a cross from senior midfielder Katie Aquilina and scored with 8:11 left in the first half to put the Crusaders on the board. \nShe then broke loose from a scramble in front of Northwestern goalkeeper McKenna Amey to put another goal in with 22:32 left in regulation. \n\"It feels really good,\" Bates said about the win. \"I think everyone's really pumped that we got this win and I think we really deserve it because we worked hard today.\" \nIt was the third two-goal game for the freshman in the last couple of weeks. \nBates also had two goals in a 6-0 win over Catasauqua on Sept. 30 and a pair in a 4-0 win over Bangor on Oct. 8. \n\"At first I was nervous,\" Bates said about playing varsity as a freshman. \"I think I've gotten so used to playing with the team that it has become easier as the season has gone on. So now it's just becoming fun.\" \n\"You know being a freshman it takes a little while to adapt to this age group of players but as the season has gone on, she's gotten more confidence and is a stronger player and very dependable,\" Notre Dame coach Sue Aquilina said. \nThe Crusaders have won five straight games and have not allowed a goal in that streak. They have outscored opponents 22-0 in the five wins. \nOn Tuesday night, senior goalkeeper M'Kenna Murphy made eight saves to preserve another shutout for the Crusaders. \nBates thinks Notre Dame's preparation has been key to the recent success. \n\"I think with our practice we've been working on tactical and technical work and with that everyone's gotten the touches better and their skill better. And so we're able to apply that to the game and that's what's been getting us these wins,\" Bates said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:39:42.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
