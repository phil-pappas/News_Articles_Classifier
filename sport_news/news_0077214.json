(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) \nBEIJING (AP) — Novak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-2 Sunday to win his sixth China Open title and improve his record at the tournament to a sterling 29-0. \nDjokovic had seven aces to none for his Spanish rival, and saved both break points he faced in the match, which was the 45th between the two players. \nNadal still leads 23-22 but hasn’t beaten Djokovic since the French Open final last year and hasn’t prevailed on hard courts since the 2013 U.S. Open final. \nThe top-ranked Serbian player has been so dominant in Beijing, he’s only lost three sets in six years. This year, he also only lost 14 games coming into the final, the fewest in his career at an ATP Tour event. \nIn the women’s final, Wimbledon runner-up Garbine Muguruza captured her second career WTA Tour title at the China Open on Sunday, rallying in both sets to defeat Timea Bacsinszky 7-5, 6-4. \nMuguruza trailed 5-2 in the opening set before winning five straight games to clinch it, then went down an early break in the second set before coming back yet again. \nThe Spaniard will rise to a career-high ranking of No. 4 on Monday, while Bacsinszky will break into the top 10 for the first time. \n“Definitely it’s a big achievement. I think, you know, to see you are improving, also on the tennis side, but in the rankings, it’s that moment when there’s only three more in front of me,” she said, smiling. “Three more. Three more.” \nMuguruza struggled after her breakthrough performance at Wimbledon, losing in the second round of the U.S. Open, but she has played some of her best tennis in the past two weeks. She also reached the final last week in Wuhan, retiring in the second set with a left ankle injury while trailing Venus Williams.
