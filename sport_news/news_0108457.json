He was released by the Jaguars on Sept. 4, one day after catching three passes for 38 yards in his preseason debut. He had been hampered for much of the preseason with hamstring trouble, but was signed to the practice squad on Sept. 6.\nThe Jaguars were one of several teams Sterling met with during the pre-draft process after 19 teams showed up at Monmouth Pro Day on March 10 when he was the headliner.\nSterling closed his Monmouth career as the most-decorated Hawks wide receiver since 2006 graduate and Philadelphia Eagle Miles Austin.\nSterling finished in the top three on the career list of every receiving category. As a senior in 2014, his 16.5 yards per catch led the Big South, while his 9.1 catches per game, 905 yards and six touchdowns were all good for second in the league. His 55 catches last season were a team-high.\nSterling became Monmouth's all-time leader in receptions (212) on Nov. 15 when he caught eight passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns at then-FCS No. 1 Coastal Carolina.\nSterling joins Austin and Buffalo Bills wide receiver Chris Hogan as former Hawks on NFL rosters. Ex-Monmouth standout cornerback Tevrin Brandon is currently with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League.\nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman4@gannettnj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:35:15.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
