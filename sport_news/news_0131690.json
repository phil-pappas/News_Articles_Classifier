Afflalo has been out since Oct. 2.\n“Hamstrings are just very delicate injuries,” Fisher said. “It’s one of the most difficult things to balance, in terms of how much is too much. The idea with Arron is he’s healthy enough to play as many out of 82 [games] as possible.\n“We want to give him the foundation to stabilize [his hamstring] and prepare him for the regular season. We don’t think it’s worth the risk at this moment.”\nFisher said the Knicks are being cautious with Afflalo, but despite the guard’s prolonged absence, he wouldn’t rule him out from being the opening night starter at shooting guard.\n“He has a great chance to, but we obviously need to see him back on the floor and out there with the group, how he fits with the guys in any particular lineup,” Fisher said. “But we brought him here for a reason, he wants to be here for a reason, and I don’t see any reason why he wouldn’t have that opportunity as long as we can see him hopefully before the preseason is over.\n“Unfortunately, we have two less games from that standpoint, but hopefully he’ll get a few games in before we finish.”\nAnother injured newcomer, forward Kevin Seraphin (sore right knee), didn’t practice on Sunday, but Fisher said he’s feeling “significantly better.”\nSeraphin is doubtful to play Monday, but Fisher hopes he can play Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:28:45.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
