(Photo: Rich McGowan/News-Messenger) Buy Photo 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nOne of the most athletic football players in the Fermont area, this Fremont Ross senior has done a little bit of everything for the Little Giants this season. While he’s taken snaps at quarterback and runs the ball from time to time, Jarren Hampton is his most dangerous lining up on the perimeter at wide receiver or in the defensive backfield. His two interceptions last week helped the Ross’ defense hold Clay to just two scores in the Little Giants’ 28-14 victory. For the season, the speedy receiver has 25 receptions for 439 yards and three touchdowns. While his athleticism and quickness allows him to get to many balls, being a little faster sure couldn’t hurt. \nIf you could have any superpower, what would it be? \nSpeed. Never too much speed. You can do so much with speed. Anything. \nWhat’s your biggest fear? \nSpiders. Spider and snakes. Since I was a kid, I’ve never liked them. (If a spider came in the room) I’d leave. \nWhat’s your biggest pet peeve? \nI’m an easy-going guy, nothing gets to me too much. Probably people not following up on their word, that gets to me a little bit. People saying they’ll do something and not following through. \nIf you could meet any person and ask them one question, who would it be and what do you ask? \nLeBron James. How did he do it, coming from the life he lived as a kid to become the man he is today? \nAny plans for after graduation? \nI’d like to be playing college football somewhere. A couple teams are interested in me, Walsh, Bluffton, OU, Trine, Eastern Michigan a little bit. Some others. (Plan to study) criminal justice. My uncle is a cop. I have some other family who are lawyers. That interests me. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LQuaOU TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:01:13.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
