Both matches will be played at the King Baudouin Stadium. \nThe match against Italy was originally scheduled to be played in Kuwait, but was moved after the Kuwaiti federation was suspended. \nThe King Baudouin Stadium is the rebuilt Heysel stadium, where 39 people died during fan violence at the European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus on May 29, 1985. \nThe Italian federation says the match will be used to commemorate the victims, most of whom were Italians, shortly after the 30th anniversary of the tragedy. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:54:06.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
