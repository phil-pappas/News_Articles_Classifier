Roberts Group I LLC is proposing to construct a Home2 Suites by Hilton that would stand roughly 56 feet tall. One issue is, it exceeds the permitted 45 feet allowable under city code for a four-story facility. But city staff are willing to allow the height increase \"if the building's exterior design met our minimum standard.\" \"If approved, this building will be highly visible from Interstate 15 given that the parcel is located less than 100 feet to freeway right-of-way ...\" a city staff report noted. According to the staff report, there are concerns that the project's off-street parking is short six stalls, but mostly that the project is not compliant with commercial design guidelines. \"The proposed 4 story building is a boxed frame with projecting elements that add variation in wall planes and roof heights that create a more interesting and less imposing structure,\" the report said, \"however the building is primarily stucco and lacks meaningful changes in materials that Home2 Suites has provided in other communities.\" The building's rather plain appearance would fail to meet the City Council's strategic planning recommendations, adopted in January 2014, that call for \"a prettier community and higher value residential,\" staff argue. The applicant has said that Hilton's design standards don't allow for changes in material, such as stone, above the first floor, and city staff have so far been unable to discuss their concerns with Hilton. Staff are recommending the Commission take one of three stances: Either continue the item to the Nov. 18 meeting so there may be talks with the applicant about exterior design alternatives, approve the plan with a design revision condition or deny the project altogether. The project would sit on 1.69 acres of vacant land fronting Amargosa Road. The property is currently city-owned — a remnant parcel from the Nisqualli Interchange Project — but the applicant is in escrow to buy it. The City Council on May 19 authorized the potential sale of the property for a \"brand hotel.\" Meanwhile, the Home2 Suites hotel, which maintains more than 50 locations in the U.S., would consist of a main lobby, lounge area, dining room with a breakfast and coffee bar, an exercise room, guest laundry room, business center, public restrooms and an indoor pool, according to the staff report. All 106 rooms will include kitchenette facilities and the hotel is also pet-friendly. The Planning Commission will meet 5 p.m. Wednesday at City Hall Council Chambers, 14343 Civic Drive.
