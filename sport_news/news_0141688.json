Bail was set at $1.75 million and court records indicate he does not yet have a lawyer. \nThe Gresham-Barlow School District said DeRemer served as an assistant coach at Gresham High last school year and has also worked with wrestlers at the middle-school level. \n\"We are shocked and concerned about these charges,\" Gresham High Principal John Koch said. \"We will be doing all we can to support our student.\" \nGresham police said their investigation began three weeks ago, when parents of a high school student reported that the coach had inappropriate contact with their son. Police said the coach confessed to investigators that he abused six boys between 2009 and 2012. \nThe boys were between the ages of 10 and 13 when the alleged abuse occurred. Two of the victims are believed to have been abused overseas. \nPolice said it does not appear any children were abused on schools grounds. \nTwo children are believed to have been abused in DeRemer's car while he was driving them home, police said. Other alleged incidents happened on an overnight camping trip for a wrestling event and in the basement where DeRemer lives at his mother's house. \nPolice said they are concerned there are more victims. DeRemer recently worked as an in-home health care provider for the state Department of Human Services, working with developmentally disabled children. \nHe has also worked as a volunteer firefighter for the Boring Fire District, an assistant event coordination for a local muscular dystrophy association and as a youth ski and snowboard instruction for Portland Shriners Hospital for Children. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:14:49.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
