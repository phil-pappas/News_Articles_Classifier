(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Carthage football team is on a roll after a road win against Willard on Friday. Carthage senior quarterback Alex Derryberry played a huge role in his return from a Jones fracture. Carthage head coach Jon Guidie said it was no surprise that his quarterback made the type of plays he did tonight against a big time opponent in Willard.“I was very happy for Alex. He was dying to get back on the field, and he made Alex Derryberry type plays tonight,” Guidie said. “That’s all we could ask from him with him being nowhere near 100 percent.” CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS Carthage is now 8-1 overall and will receive a bye in the first round of districts. Carthage got on the board first in the first quarter when Dausen Gourley took a reverse 11 yards to get Carthage up 7-0. After a Carthage fumble, Willard responded with a drive of their own in the second quarter as Kyle Smith hit Corbin White for a 10 yard touchdown. On the last play of the first half Alex Derryberry was able to find Gourley again for a 34-yard touchdown pass to take a 21-7 lead into halftime. Derryberry gave high praise to his offensive line for the big time throw he made.“Those five up front are the best in the conference and maybe even the state,” Derryberry said. “They do a great job of creating holes and giving me time to throw especially on that throw before halftime.” To add insult to injury, Carthage knocked Willard senior quarterback Kyle Smith out of the game with 3:15 remaining in the second quarter. Junior quarterback, Chance Hepola, got Willard rolling early in the second half as he hit Corbin White for a 64-yard touchdown pass to cut the deficit to 21-14. Willard then proceeded to recover a pooch kick, and then with 10:18 remaining in the third quarter, senior running back Hunter Yeargan found the end zone with a 1-yard touchdown run to tie things up. Willard was down by 7 late in the fourth quarter whenever junior Brock Howard intercepted a toss play and took it back 70 yards to give Willard a 29-28 lead as Yeargan converted the two-point conversion. Alex Derryberry was able to take keep calm and take care of business though as he found Trey Collins for a 36-yard touchdown pass with 4:29 remaining in the fourth quarter to retake the lead 36-29.“It was a huge win for us tonight,” Derryberry said “We knew Willard’s offense is good, and we knew we had to play a great football game to win this game,”“I’m glad we were able to pull this victory out before the playoffs start up.” Derryberry finished the game 9/14 through the air and threw for 213 yards and three touchdowns. He was also able to have 83 yards on the ground and score a rushing touchdown.“Honestly I thought our kids were confident that they were going to make a play to win this football,” Guidie said. “Willard deserves a lot of credit. They didn’t hang their heads and gave us a really good game tonight. We knew it wouldn’t be easy, but our guys did enough to get the job done.” CARTHAGE 36, WILLARD 29 on Friday, at Willard High School Carthage 7 14 7 8 — 36 Willard 0 7 14 8 — 29 First quarter CHS —Dausen Gourley 11 yard run (Monzon kick), 7:31 Second quarter WHS — Corbin White 10 yard pass from Kyle Smith (Hession kick), 8:44 CHS — Alex Derryberry 1 yard run (Monzon kick no good), 3:29 CHS — Dausen Gourley 34 yard pass from Alex Derryberry (2 point conv good), 0:00 Third quarter WHS — Corbin White 64 yard pass from Chance Hepola (Hession kick), 11:46 WHS — Hunter Yeargan 1 yard run (Hession kick), 10:18 CHS — Trey Collins 21 yard pass from Alex Derryberry (Monzon kick), 9:01 Fourth quarter WHS — Howard 70 yard int return (2 point conv good), 6:41 CHS — Trey Collins 34 yard pass from Alex Derryberry (2 point conv good), 4:29", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:30:32.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
