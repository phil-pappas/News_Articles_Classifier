That night he was booed because he said fans were fickle then he brings the only championship to the city. He did it not the pitcher!\" ~Ryan Cameron\n\"At home in Marietta and my Uncle and I immediately left out to go purchase our Braves Championship t-shirts!\" ~Herman Lovesher\n\"We were in a suite where champagne was flowing all evening. I remember \"We Are the Champions\" blasting away when the last out was made and the fans went crazy. I still get teased because I missed the highlight home run by David Justice because I was washing my hands in the rest room.\" ~Ott Barnard\n\"In our den at home ... with tickets in hand for the next night's game. Sure was rough to have to send them back!\" ~Faye Knowles Wells\n\"I was at the game sitting on the 3rd baseline! My husband at the time jumped up and landed feet first in his seat and broke it. ps, sorry but it was an amazing game! Bring those days back.\" ~Tammy L Norton\n\"I was on the dugout cheering I was a usher.\" ~Lawence Lothario Latimore\n\"Boycotting the '95 season because of the '94 strike,\" ~Barry Masters\n\"The morning of Game 6, 10/28, my boss called and said he was unable to go to the game and told me that I could have his 2 tickets, since it was my birthday and he knew I was a huge fan ... We sat in the right field seats, right behind the railing. When Justice hit the homer that eventually won the game it sailed about a foot over my head. I told the guy next to me that if I was 5'8\" (instead of 5'4\") I would have caught that ball. When the game was over we stuck around with thousands of other fans to celebrate the victory. Needless to say it was a great way to celebrate my birthday.\" ~Adamo\n\"At home with my (now late hubby) and my (now grown son) screaming and crying and laughing, it was by far one of the most exciting moments, it was so well deserved for the them and the right time for Atlanta to have a great baseball team. The following little league baseball season my son was chosen to be on the team that were the Braves! He was seriously excited!\" ~Victoria Rose\n\"On a camping trip with my then 7 year-old daughter and her girl scout troop. We didnt have power at camp calvin because hurricane opal had caused trees to fall. It was cold and dark, but we had a battery operated radio, and the 4 adult leaders listened to the game. Time flies!\" ~Laurie Ausley\n\"We lost Dad in 2001, so the memories of taking him to that championship-clinching game are all the more precious. Among his hobbies was wood-working. The day after that unbelievable game he made small wooden plaques for us. Etched in the wood was simply: 1995 World Series, Game 6, Atlanta 1, Cleveland 0. Glued to the wood and coated with varnish was a peanut from the bag he had been eating at the game.\" ~Dan Parker\n\"I remember being in elementary school watching the parade and feeling so proud to be from Georgia.\" ~Isha Johnston", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/22/85/80/GettyImages-236296_Otto_Greule_Jr.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/22/3d/aa/GettyOtto_Greule_Jr__Stringer.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/22/ff/0e/Rick_Stweart_Getty.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:56:46.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
