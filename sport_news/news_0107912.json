Riders departed Monday morning from the Red Church in Sonora.Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Several riders from Tuolumne County joined a bicycle tour Monday morning intended to raise awareness about the crime of human trafficking. The riders departed about 9 a.m. from the St. James Episcopal Church, also known as the Red Church, in downtown Sonora, after a brief group prayer. Organized by the Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin, the “Tour Against Trafficking” has raised more than $35,000 since it began earlier this month in Taft. “We’ve had innumerable cyclists from all over join us,” said Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin Bishop David Rice, who was dressed in cycling tights emblazoned with the tour’s heart-shaped logo made out of bicycle gears. Rice and several others have been riding for 14 days, covering more than 616 miles and climbing a total of about 25,000 feet in elevation. The money raised by the tour will be distributed among 10 organizations throughout the Central Valley and Sierra foothills that are working to combat the crime of human trafficking, which involves the forcible exploitation of men, women and children for the purpose of labor, prostitution or child pornography. Human trafficking throughout the world generates profits of up to $32 billion annually, according to experts. As many as 17,500 people are trafficked into the United States each year, with about 46 percent of them having known their recruiters in some capacity. “It’s just mind boggling to me that so many people are becoming aware,” said Jan Miller of the Center for a Non Violent Community in Sonora. “With our recent human trafficking case here, I really feel like from top to bottom we’re looking at this as a community.” Tuolumne County District Attorney Laura Krieg announced last month that an Oakdale man had pleaded guilty in the county’s first-ever human trafficking case. Daniel Leon Clifton, 35, pleaded guilty at a pretrial conference Sept. 28 in Tuolumne County Superior Court to one felony count of human trafficking, one felony count of making criminal threats and one felony count of possessing child pornography in excess of 600 images. Clifton, who was arrested Feb. 2 at his residence on the 500 block of Hampton Court, posed as a 17-year-old on an online dating app intended for teenagers to lure a 15-year-old Tuolumne County girl into sending him explicit pictures and engaging in a relationship with him, Krieg said. As part of the plea agreement with the District Attorney’s Office, Clifton will be ordered to serve more than 21 years in state prison. His sentencing is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Monday in Tuolumne County Superior Court. “The Internet has turned our small community into a global community,” Krieg said during an event held at Sonora Opera Hall on Sept. 16 to promote awareness of human trafficking. A barbecue dinner hosted Saturday at the Red Church as the riders on the bicycle tour came into town drew more than 50 people, according to Lauralee Brown, a member of the church’s committee that organized the Sonora leg. Other members of the organizing committee included local law enforcement officials, school administrators and elected leaders, such as Krieg, Tuolumne County Sheriff Jim Mele, Superintendent of Schools Margie Bulkin and Sonora City Councilwoman Connie Williams. “This is an issue that has been covered up, and many children have been sucked into this,” Williams said outside the church Monday morning. “We need to make people aware of what’s happening so hopefully they won’t become a victim.” Retired Superintendent of Schools Joe Silva, a member of the Red Church, has led the efforts over the past few months to organize the bicycle tour’s Sonora leg. He joined the tour Monday morning with plans to ride up to Columbia State Historic Park. Silva said, if nothing else, the process has brought together community leaders to take a deeper look at the issue. “By having this, there was a lot of good communication between agencies about what we’re doing and what we need to be doing,” he said.
