The Mets said Flores sustained a fractured right fibula.\nUtley was ruled safe on a video review, which determined Tejada's foot missed the bag. Utley also appeared not to touch the base.\nLos Angeles scored four runs in the inning and went on to win 5-2.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:47:55.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
