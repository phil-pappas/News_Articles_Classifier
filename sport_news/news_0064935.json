The Terrapins ran the ball at will against the Lions defense, with quarterback Perry Hills rushing for 124 yards on 26 carries and completing 19 of 28 passes for 225 yards and a score but with three interceptions. \nThe Lions were nursing a one-point lead when free safety Marcus Allen tackled Maryland receiver Levern Jacobs 3 yards short of a first down, and Penn State took over on downs at its 38 with 3:05 to play. The Nittany Lions did not make a first down and punted, and the Terps took over at their own 25 with 1:21 remaining. \nOn the first play, Hills' pass went off the hands of Malcolm Culmer and into the arms of Golden, who plays in nickel situations, at the Terps 42. \nPenn State held a 17-13 lead at halftime, but the lead changed three times in the third quarter. The Terrapins went ahead, 20-17, on Brandon Ross' 10-yard run, but the Nittany Lions got the TD right back on a 79-yard drive helped by Hackenberg's 31-yard pass to Godwin. Two plays later, Hackenberg threw to the left sideline to Hamilton, who came in on the underthrown ball, caught it, and scored. \nMaryland made a statement on its next drive. A penalty on the kickoff moved the Terps back to the 12, and another 10-yard penalty was assessed three plays later. But they converted on third and 11 and went down the field again, scoring on a 10-yard pass from Hills to DeAndre Lane for a 27-24 Maryland lead. \nBut the Nittany Lions still had their offense humming. After a double-pass trick play failed, they got a 27-yard completion from Hackenberg to Godwin to move into Terrapin territory, and another 27-yard pass that Lewis caught in the end zone for his first touchdown of the season, making it 31-27 Lions. \nBrad Craddock's third field goal of the game, a 29-yarder, brought the Terps to within 31-30 with just over 10 minutes to play. Craddock had kicked a 36-yarder earlier, but the Lions were called for roughing the kicker, a play that sent Craddock off limping. \nLong completions by Hackenberg led to both of Penn State's touchdowns in the first half. \nOn the Nittany Lions' third possession, the junior hit Hamilton for 38 yards and Godwin for 40 to set up the visitors at the Maryland 6, from where Barkley swept right behind some good blocking and scored untouched. The TD came after safety Jordan Lucas recovered a Hills fumble at the Penn State 17. \nThe Terrapins scored just 1:13 later on a three-play drive, with Hills finding Culmer deep for 48 yards to put them at the Lions 12. On the next play, Hills eluded defensive end Carl Nassib in the backfield and powered in over Allen for the score. \nPenn State accounted for minus-1 yard on its three possessions after its first touchdown, and lost a turnover when Barkley fumbled a handoff and defensive back A.J. Hendy recovered for the Terps. That led to a 44-yard field goal by Craddock that gave Maryland the lead. \nAfter a successful 27-yard boot by Craddock made it 13-7, the Lions took over at their own 75 and struck swiftly in just two plays. Hackenberg found Saeed Blacknall deep for 38 yards, and then fired a 37-yard pass that Godwin caught, outfighting Anthony Nixon, and scored on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:10:29.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
