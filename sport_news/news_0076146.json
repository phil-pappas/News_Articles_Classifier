(Fred Chartrand ... more > By -   \nOTTAWA, Ontario (AP) - Mikkel Boedker scored three goals and the Arizona Coyotes beat the Ottawa Senators 4-1 on Saturday night to snap a four-game losing streak. \nBrad Richardson also scored, and Anders Lindback made 35 saves in his first start of the season to help Arizona improve to 4-3-1. \nCody Ceci scored for Ottawa, and Craig Anderson stopped 22 shots. The Senators are 3-3-2. \nRichardson broke a 1-1 tie with 5:29 left when he dove for the puck and was able to get it behind Anderson. Boedker made it 3-1 with 4:11 to go and completed the hat trick with an empty-netter with 2:01 remaining. \nBoedker opened the scoring with just over a minute left in the first period, slipping behind Erik Karlsson and beating Anderson to the glove side. \nCeci tied it late in the second, taking a pass from Bobby Ryan and beating Lindback to the short side. \nThe Senators played the final two periods without Curtis Lazar. Lazar went-face first into the corner boards on a hit from Zbynek Michalek in the first period. Lazar took a few more shifts, but didn’t come out for the remainder of the game. \nNOTES: Max McCormick made his NHL debut for the Senators after being called up to replace Mike Hoffman, who is day-to-day with a lower-body injury. D Marc Methot was a late scratch despite saying he would play in the morning. LW Clarke MacArthur didn’t play because of a concussion. … The Coyotes were without C Antoine Vermette (upper-body). \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:14:14.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
