He also conceded that he had not made a note of the fact that Mr McCullum had asked that his domestic cricket board not be told he was making a statement. \nMr Pownall then read an excerpt from Mr McCullum's statement relating to the evening in Calcutta when Cairns allegedly made a \"business proposition\" to his colleague. \nIt read: \"We had general conversation and then after about half an hour he (Cairns) asked me if I knew anything about spread betting. \n\"I told him that I didn't. I initially thought he was taking the p***.\" \nHe added that Cairns then started to explain, using a pen and paper, continuing: \"He was telling me you can make a great deal of money. He told me you could make between 80,000 to 250,000 US dollars a day. \n\"He told me that he had never done it on an international match.\" \nReferring to this statement, Mr Pownall said to Mr Rhodes: \"The conversation between Mr McCullim and Mr Cairns concerned betting, not an approach for Mr McCullum to underperform in a particular match. That is right, isn't it?\" \nThe witness replied: \"The inference is in the statement. It is clear to me than an approach is being made by Mr Cairns to Mr McCullum.\" \nMr Pownall clarified: \"To fix matches or to underperform?\" \"Yes,\" agreed Mr Rhodes. However, when asked: \"Where does it say that?\" he replied: \"It doesn't.\" \nThe former police officer told jurors he did not ask Mr McCullum specifically what he meant, because he was not \"in a position to put words\" into his mouth. \nWhen Mr Pownall suggested the ACSU had done \"nothing\" after Mr McCullum gave his statement, Mr Rhodes responded that the Indian Cricket League (ICL) was an unsanctioned tournament over which the ICC had no jurisdiction. \nBut Mr Pownall said the allegations being made were \"potentially momentous\". \nMr Rhodes told the court: \"The information at that time was not corroborated by any other source. I would need to corroborate it, for it to become momentous.\" \nHowever, he added that he had \"no reason\" to believe Mr McCullum had not been telling the truth. He told the court that as a field officer his job was simply to collect the information and that the decision whether or not to investigate was taken by his superiors. \nIn 2010 Cairns was accused by the chairman of the Indian Premier League, Lalit Modi, on Twitter of match-fixing at the Chandigarh Lions in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) two years earlier. \nCairns brought a libel action against Mr Modi and successfully sued him, winning Â£90,000 in damages. \nCairns, 45, from Auckland, is charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice, while Andrew Fitch-Holland, from Burton Road, Manchester, is accused of perverting the course of justice. \nThe court also heard evidence from Sir Ronnie Flanagan, Her Majesty's former chief inspector of constabulary, and current chairman of the Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) at the ICC. \nHe told jurors it is not the case that \"nothing\" would have been done after Mr McCullum made his statement, but that the information would have been put into the system which would have recognised any corroborative material. \nSir Ronnie also denied the ACSU had made Cairns a scapegoat in light of the criticism it had faced in the media with regards to how it handled corruption allegations. \nReferring to players like Mr McCullum and Andre Adams, Mr Pownall put it to the the witness: \"In respect of its (the ACSU's) dealings with the named individuals, corners were cut, normal action was left to one side with a view to achieving the scalp of Chris Cairns.\" \nSir Ronnie replied, \"absolutely not\", adding: \"If scalp turns out to be an appropriate description, I think it is an absolute tragedy.\" \nSpeaking generally on the issue of corruption in sport, and in particular cricket, he said the actions of the perpetrators were comparable to those of \"paedophiles\", with young players being \"groomed\" with \"small gifts\". \nSir Ronnie continued: \"Young men may find their hotel rooms being knocked by young women. They might be enticed into compromising positions with their photographs, and they are then ensnared or sometimes physical violence may be threatened against them.\" \nThe trial continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:20:11.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
