A work in progress. 7/10. \nALEX CUTHBERT: Enjoyed his best game for some time in a Wales shirt, looking hungry for work, as Wales claimed a hard-fought win. 7 \nTYLER MORGAN: Unlucky not to score a first-half try, and he did not look out of place on his World Cup debut. 7 \nJAMIE ROBERTS: One of his quieter games, but the Harlequins centre spent much of it coping with bringing down Fiji's dangerous broken-field runners. 6 \nGEORGE NORTH: Made his intentions clear through a searing run inside two minutes, but Fiji marked him closely after that. 7 \nDAN BIGGAR: Another strong display by the Ospreys fly-half, who contributed 13 points and has yet to miss a kick at goal in this World Cup. 7 \nGARETH DAVIES: Scored a try and was comfortably Wales' best player. He combined searing pace with a tireless work-rate around the forward fringes. 9 \nGETHIN JENKINS: Despite his vast Test match experience, there was little he could do to help shore up a worryingly-creaking Wales scrum. 5 \nSCOTT BALDWIN: Claimed a try as Wales looked to pull ahead, but the scrum remains a real concern for Wales. 6 \nTOMAS FRANCIS: Struggled again in the critical scrummaging area, and could make way for Samson Lee against Australia next week. 5 \nBRADLEY DAVIES: Suffered a facial injury early on, but manfully battled on as Wales faced some intense opposition in all areas. 6 \nALUN-WYN JONES: Put himself about as usual, but it was an occasion when Wales were hugely relieved to claim the win. 6 \nDAN LYDIATE: Made his 50th Wales appearance and once again fearlessly put his body on the line throughout, although Wales' overall missed tackle count will be a cause for concern. 7 \nSAM WARBURTON: The Wales captain battled away to keep his team on the front foot when Fiji's defiance and resilience sometimes threatened to assume control. 7 \nTAULUPE FALETAU: Found himself at the back of a retreating scrum on too many occasions, but he salvaged the situation several times on the occasion of his 50th cap. 7 \nReplacements \nSamson Lee: Replaced Francis early in the second half, and he must start against Australia next week. 7 \nKen Owens: Took over from Baldwin after 55 minutes. 6 \nLuke Charteris: Went on 16 minutes from time as a permanent replacement for Bradley Davies. Made an impact. 7 \nAaron Jarvis: Featured for the last 13 minutes as Wales looked to close the game out. 6 \nJustin Tipuric: Replaced Lydiate as the clocked ticked down. 6 \nJames Hook: Called up as a squad replacement earlier this week, he joined the action after 71 minutes. 6 \nRhys Priestland: Replaced Biggar after 73 minutes. 6 Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:37:28.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
