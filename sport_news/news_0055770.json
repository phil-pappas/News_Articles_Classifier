Im very proud of these girls for getting back to state again.”\nDavis' Olivia Wade\nDRAPER — Sometimes, in a game that comes down to inches and momentum, all you need for the stars to favorably align and come out on top is one perfectly-executed play and a flawless finish.\nAnd that's exactly what No. 1 and defending state champ Davis did in its heavyweight 5A semifinal matchup against No. 1 Fremont Tuesday evening.\nThe undefeated and nationally-ranked Darts, who struggled offensively for the vast majority of the game, capitalized off Olivia Wade's tremendous goal in just the second minute and kept Fremont out of the net the rest of the way to pick up the hard-fought 1-0 shutout victory and advance to a second straight 5A championship.\n“We just wanted to push really hard in the first couple minutes and see if we could get a goal in there — sometimes one is all it takes. Obviously, we did and we were able to hang on for the win. We just all worked so hard. I’m very proud of these girls for getting back to state again,” Wade said.\nAfter giving up the momentous goal, Fremont responded tremendously and quickly established its offense to remain on the prowl for the equalizer.\nThe two teams continued to trade blows throughout the first half with the Silverwolves having more possession time and controlling the tempo, but with Davis firing more shots and posing more of a scoring threat.\nFremont squandered several equalizer opportunities while the Darts, despite their offensive woes, headed to the break with a momentous 1-0 lead and control.\n“That whole saying that defense wins championships is 100 percent true, especially in the playoffs where games are really tight. Our defense has been strong the whole time and kept us in games when our offense hasn’t been in a rhythm. We know we wouldn’t be anywhere close to where we are without our defense,” Davis head coach Souli Phongsavath said.\nFremont quickly regrouped at the break, made some minor adjustments and presented the home team's attack with some challenges to slow them down.\nThe visitor’s stout defense, anchored by senior defender Nicole Allen and GK Shyann Jones, played with a much-needed sense of urgency and physicality to control the tempo and put some pressure back on Davis.\nThe Silverwolves' impressive ball-handling and great movement kept the visitors deep in the Darts' territory and set up a handful of scoring opportunities.\nHowever, relying on the star-studded play of senior defenders Haylee Cacciacarne and Stoddard along with GK Kendyl Baker, the defending champs didn't budge and remained on the hunt for an insurance score in the final 15 minutes.\n“Our defense is phenomenal. They’re the best in the whole state and it’s just an honor to be working with such a great defense. They always support me and back me up, so I’m very thankful for them. Haylee Cacciacarne and Mia Stoddard, our center backs, worked so hard all game and we’re just very fortunate to have defensive leaders like them on our team,” said Wade.\nThen, in the final three minutes, Fremont desperately bombarded Davis with a barrage of shots with the hopes of creating some late-game heroics and saving its season.\nUnfortunately for the Silverwolves, the Darts are the defending 5A state champs, undefeated and nationally ranked because they don't let games like these slip away.\nAnd Tuesday was no exception.\nClinging to a one-goal lead, Baker didn't let a single ball slip past her and came up with several saves, including two game-clinching stops in the final two minutes, to help Davis outlast Fremont 1-0 and advance to a second straight 5A championship.\n“Through an injury, Kendyl was able to step up, take on this role in this playoff run and has come up huge for us. They came at us hard and they’re a great, well-coached team. We had to grind it out — but right now, a win is a win and we’ll take it,” Phongsavath added.\nRyan Love is a full-time student and has been a part-time sportswriter for Deseret News since Oct. 2012.\nFollow him on Twitter @RLove7724\nEMAIL: rlove@deseretnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:32:06.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
