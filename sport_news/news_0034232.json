Further updates will be forthcoming.\" \nQualifying is still scheduled to take part at 1300 (1900BST) but, with the bad weather showing little sign of relenting, the session is in doubt. \nIf qualifying is cancelled, it is likely to be moved to Sunday morning. The second practice session on Friday was scrapped following the continued bad weather in Austin. \nLewis Hamilton will win his third Formula One championship on Sunday if he wins at the Circuit of the Americas and Sebastian Vettel, his nearest challenger, finishes third or lower.
