The fine game though there was no penalty on the play (Kalil left the game for one play and then returned). \nChancellor wrote on Twitter sarcastically “Welcome to the NFL kids!! !!” saying that the hit came “unintentionally.” \nPlayers can appeal fines, and sometimes can win, though those results are not always made as public as the fines.
