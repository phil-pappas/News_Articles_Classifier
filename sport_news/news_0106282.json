It was the first career touchdown for Williams, a fifth-year senior. By Rick Peterson Jr. richard.peterson@cjonline.com \nWashburn coach Craig Schurig refers to receiver Chad Williams as an “unsung hero” of the Ichabods, admiring the fifth-year senior’s work ethic and leadership in practice. \nGiven his opportunity in the spotlight, Williams rewarded the Ichabods with one of the signature moments in last Saturday's 27-21 win over Missouri Southern. \nThe Chapman native caught what proved to be the game-winning touchdown with 1:16 left, capturing his first career touchdown in the process. \n“I thought that was one of the cooler things of the game, him catching that touchdown,” Schurig said. \nAfter injuries to three WU receivers, Williams entered the game in a key spot after the Ichabods’ drove to the Southern 5-yard line, trailing 21-19. \nThe play was designed to go to the tight end, but Williams broke free in the flat. \n“He actually wasn’t my first read on the play,” WU quarterback Derek McGinnis said. “I just saw him, out of the corner of my eye, pop wide open. Just to get him the ball and get him his touchdown, that was awesome.” \nIt was a rewarding moment for Williams, whose first career catch came earlier this season. \n“It was really awesome,” Williams said. “I got to score right in front of my family, too. I was pretty pumped about that. I’ve grinded during my five years here. It was a pretty special moment for me.” \nWilliams, who threw for 1,619 yards and rushed for 354 rushing yards as a senior quarterback at Chapman, also started his career at Washburn as a reserve quarterback before moving to receiver. \n“The guys who get on the field aren’t necessarily the only leaders on the team,” Williams said. “I definitely have been a leader for a lot of the guys, and they were pretty happy for me, too.” \nWiillams said the touchdown should give him a confidence boost for the rest of the season. \n“It got that chip off my shoulder to score that first touchdown,” Williams said. “Hopefully they’ll be more this season. I’ll definitely be hungry for more. \n“I get a lot of reps in practice. They know I can do anything once I get put in the situation. I know exactly what I’m doing when I’m put in, and I think they’re all pretty confident in me.” \nWilliams provides depth for a receiving corps that was depleted by the end of the Southern game. Senior receiver Connor Crimmins will be out with a high-ankle sprain for Saturday’s 7 p.m. game at Fort Hays State, but Schurig said the rest of his receivers should be available. \n“If there are injuries, I’ll have to step up and be that guy that gets in,” Williams said. “If that’s the case, I’ll be ready.” \nRick Jr. Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1290 or rick.peterson.jr@cjonline.com .Follow Rick Jr. on Twitter @RickiePeterson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:36:53.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
