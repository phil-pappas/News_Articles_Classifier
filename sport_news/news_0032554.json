Dr Ram Bhagat, District Malaria Officer, said intense fogging was under way in all vulnerable and suspected colonies, especially those where dengue cases had surfaced. He said the Municipal Corporation Faridabad (MCF) would undertake the fogging operation, as the district Health Department was facing staff crunch. Nearly 200 to 250 patients of fever are reporting in the OPD daily and majority of them seek or are advised blood test in view of dengue outbreak, sources said. “The patients should not panic as blood platelets reduce in every case of fever,” said Dr Virender Yadav, a physician. Of the total dengue patients in the district, nearly 15 received treatment at the Civil Hospital. No death due to dengue or malaria has surfaced till now, it is added. In all, 450 dengue cases were reported in the district last year while 46 cases were reported in 2013. The number of malaria cases has gone up to 85 as compared to 134 last year and 1,100 in 2013. Sunit Dhawan\nTribune News Service\nRohtak, October 11\nThe Health Department has launched an intensive campaign to check the spread of dengue in the city. In all, 17 teams, comprising 200 officials from the Health Department and Municipal Corporation, have been formed to inspect the residential as well as commercial buildings and take measures wherever required. District Civil Surgeon Dr Shiv Kumar told The Tribune today: “Dengue is more prevalent in urban areas. Hence, health workers posted in villages have been called and included in the teams to survey urban pockets.” The teams covered the entire city in two days, he said. “They inspected more than 25,000 buildings today. Mosquito larvae were found breeding at 339 spots. The team members either got the water containers bearing the larvae cleaned or used insecticide.” The teams of the Health Department had earlier found larvae of mosquitoes on the premises of the local PGIMS, SDM’s office, Mayor’s house, State Bank of India branches, certain government and private colleges, Police Lines and a couple of police stations.
