The Bears (5-0) moved up one position to No. 23 after beating Washington State 34-28. \nOhio State remained No. 1 and tied a poll record, despite lagging support from the voters. The Buckeyes held off Indiana 34-27 and now have been top-ranked 101 times, matching Oklahoma for the most in the 79-year history of the media poll. \nAfter four top-10 teams lost Saturday, the rankings were rattled and five teams received first-place votes. The Buckeyes received 38 first-place votes, their fewest this season after beginning as the first unanimous preseason No. 1. No. 2 TCU got five first-place votes, No. 3 Baylor received 10, No. 5 Utah had seven, and No. 9 Texas A&M had one. \nThe Utes (4-0), who jumped five spots after their bye week, will play host to Cal on Saturday night. \nBoth Bay Area teams climbed two spots in the coaches poll, with Stanford landing at No. 18 and Cal at No. 22. Georgia: Coach Mark Richt says he's sticking with Greyson Lambert as the Bulldogs starting quarterback. Lambert completed just 10 of 24 passes for 86 yards in a 38-10 loss to Alabama. Brice Ramsey also got some playing time, but he completed only one pass and had two interceptions.

The freshman said in a statement issued by the university that \"in no way did I intend to be disrespectful or disloyal\" when he retweeted what amounted to an invitation to transfer from an apparent supporter of the Aggies, a rival the Longhorns don't play anymore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:38:04.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
