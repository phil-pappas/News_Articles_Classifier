Here are the ranks for Week 5. Week 5 Fantasy Football Ranks Fantasy Football Rankings powered by FantasyPros Jay Cutler looked more than servicable in his return to action against the Raiders. He’ll now draw a Chiefs team that has given up multiple passing scores in every game but one, and let Andy Dalton pass for 324 yards in the other. With Alshon Jeffery expected back, he deserves his rank as a start-worthy QB this week. I’m down on Freeman this week. Listen, he’s looked the part and he’s posted some big numbers in the last two weeks but I think its going to be tough for Atlanta’s line to get serious push against a challenging Washington front-seven. Tevin Coleman is back in the mix to nab a few carries, and, all told I’m just not in love with the matchup. Don’t chase last (ok, the last two…) week’s points. I’ve had to come to terms with bumping Calvin Johnson into low WR2 range. He’ll face Patrick Peterson and the Cardinals this week, and while he nearly scored in Week 4 and Stafford took a few deep shots, the whole offense doesn’t look good. He’ll likely be a 18-24 range WR for me in most weeks until the production changes. Give me all of the Owen Daniels shares this week against a Raiders team that has given up a score to every starting TE they’ve faced to date. He’s not getting a ton of work in Denver, but, is Peyton’s primary read at TE and Oakland really hasn’t defended the position well. See Exhibit A, Martellus Bennett’s WIDE OPEN touchdown last week as just one such example.
