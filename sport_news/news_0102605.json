Trabona said the charge was the harshest the law would allow.\n\"If the baby would have been thinking it's a play gun and shot somebody with it, you don't know where that bullet is going. It was a semi-automatic. If he would have pulled it, he could have pulled it again. There was another bullet ready to go,\" Trabona said.\n\"I freaked out because I'm trying to figure out, where's my child? Is she ok? What part was isolated? What happened?\" Amite Elementary parent Michelle Brumfield said. \"But once I saw the write-up, I'm likem, oh my gosh that's on the pre-k kindergarten hall.\"\nPolice say the gun is registered.\nThe Department of Family and Child Services released the child into the custody of a family member, Trabona said.\nTrabona believes the child thought the gun was a toy.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
