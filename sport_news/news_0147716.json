I about lost it. @Colts @Jaguars\n— Graham Watson (@Yahoo_Graham) October 4, 2015\nI have covered male sporting events all over the world and it took coming to Indianapolis to face my first gender discrimination. @NFL\n— Graham Watson (@Yahoo_Graham) October 4, 2015 Watson notes that she was eventually allowed in the locker room after the man asked several others if she was cleared to get in.\nI do want to note that we did eventually get in and we were able to do our job after the man asked several males if it was OK if we got in.\n— Graham Watson (@Yahoo_Graham) October 4, 2015 That is some poor discrimination that just shouldn't happen in 2015.\nWe saw this happen to a female reporter covering the Masters in 2011 and that caused a huge stir -- for good reason. A year later the exclusive club admitted its first female members . It's been four years since then; you would figure it's common knowledge that female reporters have equal access as males, but apparently that's not entirely the case.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/Yahoo_Graham/status/650795746841595904", "https://twitter.com/Jaguars", "https://twitter.com/Yahoo_Graham/status/650783817385414656", "https://twitter.com/Colts", "https://twitter.com/NFL", "http://larrybrownsports.com/golf/condoleezza-rice-darla-moore-first-female-members-augusta-national/151020", "https://twitter.com/Yahoo_Graham/status/650785312851914752", "https://twitter.com/Yahoo_Graham/status/650784542924537856", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://larrybrownsports.com/golf/tara-sullivan-denied-access-to-locker-room-at-masters-augusta-apologizes/62913"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:43:18.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
