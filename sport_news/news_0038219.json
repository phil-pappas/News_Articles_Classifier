(USATSI) \n\nThe Mets have won Game 3 of their NLDS with the Dodgers and they did so in blowout fashion, 13-7. The Dodgers took an early 3-0 lead, but the Mets immediately stormed back and then never relinquished the lead. The Mets now have a 2-1 lead in the best of five series.\nHere are five things to know.\n1. The Mets have dominated this series \nYes, the series is only 2-1 Mets, but it's real close to a sweep. The Mets never trailed in Game 1 and they controlled Game 3 from the time Curtis Granderson hit a bases-loaded double in the second inning.\nAnd then there was Game 2. The Mets had a lead from the second inning until the bottom of the seventh. We know that the Dodgers got four runs in the bottom of the seventh to win the game, but they shouldn't have gotten any of them.\nWhy? Look, we're not gonna rehash the entire Chase Utley - Ruben Tejada play, but here's the rule:\n(e) If, in the judgment of the umpire, a base runner willfully and deliberately interferes with a batted ball or a fielder in the act of fielding a batted ball with the obvious intent to break up a double play, the ball is dead. The umpire shall call the runner out for interference and also call out the batter-runner because of the action of his teammate. In no event may bases be run or runs scored because of such action by a runner. I don't know how you can watch that and think Utley didn't violate it. MLB has since called the slide \"illegal,\" which means a double play should have been awarded and the inning would have been ended with a 2-1 Mets lead.\nWe don't know if the Dodgers would have come back afterward. It's possible they still would have.\nAll I'm saying is that the only win the Dodgers have in this series was thanks to botched officiating. The Mets have owned this thing through three games.\n\nThe Mets had some fun on Monday night. (USATSI) \n\n2. The Dodgers appear to only have two viable starters \nClayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke were two of the three best NL starters in the regular season. After that, there's a big fall off. Brett Anderson was roughly average (101 ERA+ in the regular season) while Alex Wood was pretty bad once joining the Dodgers (86 ERA+). Playoff baseball means it's time for the cream to rise to the top.\nWell, on Monday in Game 3, Anderson was torched by the Mets for six runs on seven hits in three-plus innings. This came after being spotted a 3-0 lead early by his offense. Wood would relieve him and not fare any better, allowing four runs on four hits in two innings of work.\nBasically, once the Dodgers get past Kershaw and Greinke, they look to be in trouble. If they can come back and win this series, it's a problem that'll be revisited in the NLCS.\n3. Matt Harvey was good, but inefficient \nHe got in trouble early, but weathered the storm, allowing two runs on seven hits in five innings. Harvey also walked two while striking out seven. It's definitely not a great outing, but it worked. He got plenty of run support and got his ballclub through five innings.\nShould there be concern moving forward? Probably. Harvey needed 97 pitches to get through five innings and we already know the thought is that he's up against the wall in terms of his season-long workload and where the Mets wanted him to end up.\n4. The Mets got revenge where it mattered most \nLeading up to the game, there was much discussion about whether or not the Mets would retaliate for the Utley play by throwing at someone on the Dodgers. I always hate this, because I think the best revenge is to beat someone on the scoreboard.\nThe Mets did that and then some. They took the Dodgers to the proverbial woodshed. That's the best revenge in the follow-up game. The only thing better would be to send the Dodgers home, and that's what they'll have a chance to do in Game 4.\nLet's hope the message remains the same, that the Mets aren't interested in getting into some sort of beanball war. Those are silly.\n5. Clayton Kershaw is coming back on short rest for Game 4 \nHe's still the best pitcher in the world, but Kershaw is 1-6 with a 4.99 ERA in his postseason career. This is the third time in the past three years that Kershaw came back on short rest in the divisional series round.\nIn 2013, he allowed two runs in six innings, but they were both unearned. Last season, he got through six scoreless innings but then coughed up a three-run homer before recording an out in the seventh.\nOverall, those aren't terrible results, but take note of how he was unable to work as deep in the game as the Dodgers would surely prefer. Due to the short rest, we can't expect Kershaw to be effective in the seventh or eighth innings. This could loom large is his counterpart, Steven Matz , throws the ball well for the Mets.\nTopics: Alex Wood , Brett Anderson , Chase Utley , Clayton Kershaw , Curtis Granderson , Matt Harvey , Ruben Tejada , Steven Matz , Zack Greinke , Los Angeles Dodgers , New York Mets , MLB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:42:49.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
