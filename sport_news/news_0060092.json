Following an internal inquiry, the AAI has barred foreign coach Lim Chae Chong and Indian coaches Surinder Singh (recurve archery) and Jiwanjot Singh (compound archery) for one year from accompanying the team to international events. The ban will be effective retrospectively from July 2015. However, the AAI let off compound archers Gurwinder Singh, Kanwalpreet Singh and Aman after finding “no fault in their conduct”. Some media reports had claimed that the archers forfeited the match as they were busy “sightseeing”, which the AAI panel found to be untrue. The reason given by the coaches was that the bow of one of the archers had broken down just before the match, and they had to send someone to get a bow from the women archers, who were in the team hotel. Earlier, the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) had suspended the archers and Jiwanjot from being part of national and international university events for three years, starting with the current academic year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:18:01.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
