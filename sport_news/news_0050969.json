She had to be.\nAt age 13, the Beaverton seventh grader was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer . One year later – when most teens are preoccupied with high school crushes or making the team – she was told she had only months to live.\nBut Nathalie continued to live the only way she knew how – determinedly, with a smile on her face.\nThe end came Monday. She was 16.\nShe didn't let cancer win. She survived risky surgeries, advocated for better access to pediatric drugs in clinical trials and, along the way, united a community.\nNathalie beat cancer every day: When she went to her classes at Sunset High School, despite pain or nausea, she beat it. When she helped organize fundraisers for cancer research, she beat it. When she walked on to a football field last year as a homecoming princess, she beat it. And when she faced each day with renewed hope and undeniable grit, she beat it.\nHer father, Nathan Traller, compares the last three and a half years of Nathalie's life to an epic cross-country race.\n\"She finished the race and set all sorts of records along the way,\" he said.\nAnd while her family wishes the finish line had been farther out, they don't feel a sense of failure, Nathan said, but one of accomplishment.\nA cancer with no cure\nHonoring Nathalie Nathalie's family has not yet chosen a date for a celebration of her life, but hopes to hold one in early November. Those interested in making a donation in Nathalie's memory can do so at 4nathalie.com/\ndonate . The Trallers will give proceeds to Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma research. The family is also accepting memories of Nathalie from those who knew her in the form of words, photos and videos. Send your memories to admin@\n4nathalie.com . Nathalie was diagnosed with a rare form of sarcoma, itself a rare form of cancer. In her words – Nathalie periodically blogged about her experiences – \"to say that it's rare is kind of an understatement.\"\nWhen she was diagnosed in 2012, the disease had already spread. There's no known treatment. Immunotherapy treatments were Nathalie's only chance, but they were still in clinical trials, out of reach.\nBecause of Nathalie's age, she was barred from the trials typically open only to patients 18 and older. So the Trallers asked drug companies to waive their minimum age requirement through the Food and Drug Administration's expanded access program , also called \"compassionate use.\"\nAfter many months of social media campaigns, media coverage and letters to drug companies and politicians, pharmaceutical company Genentech made an exception for Nathalie.\nA strong year\nIn August 2014, Nathalie began taking immunotherapy drugs, and for the first time, she responded to treatment.\nIt wasn't enough – Nathan says the drugs were just one piece of a combination of treatments she needed to recover – but they gave Nathalie an extra year, a stronger year. She used that time to throw herself into school (getting straight As) and to go on family vacations.\nBut she also grew into a leader, Nathan said.\nShe helped organize a Sunset High fundraiser for Doernbecher Children's Hospital, where she was a patient. She ran for student government and won a role heading the philanthropy committee. And she helped raise thousands of dollars that she was able to donate specifically to research for her form of cancer, alveolar soft part sarcoma, which targets the body's soft tissues.\nNathalie Traller has been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer Nathalie Traller, who just finished her freshman year at Sunset High School, has been diagnosed with Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma, a rare form of cancer. There is no known successful treatment of the disease, so the Trallers are asking drug companies to bend the rules and allow Nathalie into clinical trials for a new drug that could help her.\nNathalie had other passions, too: She loved to swim, participated youth group at Foursquare Church and enjoyed creating art. She hoped to become an oncology nurse, so she could help others the way her nurses had helped her. Through each part of her life, she brought people together.\n\"She went so much farther than she was supposed to, and she was a connector,\" said her father. \"There were people from so many different strata that were impacted because of how she decided to handle the challenge.\"\nIn Nathalie's death, those connections are more evident than ever: On Tuesday night, friends held an impromptu candlelight vigil in her memory. On Friday night, students and fans at football games throughout the Metro League added Sunset's color to their outfits in a \"purple-out\" for Nathalie – her favorite color.\nSunset Principal John Huelskamp said he was touched – though not surprised – by the show of solidarity, which was completely student-organized.\n\"She had an incredible ability to unify,\" he said.\nShe also set an example for her fellow students, he said. Her decision to come to school when she was in pain showed her commitment to her studies.\n\"She sets an incredibly high bar when it comes to grace, when it comes tenacity, when it comes to perseverance,\" Huelskamp said.\nNathalie's classmates will mourn her, he said, but they also will celebrate who she was and the impact she made on their lives.\nFor Sunset classmate Natalie Day, Nathalie's impact was her selflessness. The two became close in leadership class and were connected by a common bond: Day's brother had been diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma. Day said she was struck by Nathalie's selflessness last Friday, when she visited her in the hospital.\nKnowing Nathalie's condition had worsened, Day avoided asking how she was. Instead, Nathalie wanted to know everything going on with Day.\n\"It just amazed me,\" Day said.\nLooking ahead\nNothing could have completely prepared Nathalie's father, mother Vicki and younger sister Kelley for her passing.\n\"Were there things left undone, things that needed to be said that weren't?\" Nathan said. \"No. That's the state we lived in for three and a half years. We lived in a sort of hyper-intense emotional closeness.\"\nNow they'll continue her fight, raising money for cancer research and advocating for better access to pediatric drugs for rare diseases.\nFor now, it's all about Nathalie. Nathalie the fighter.\nLike any great fighter, she was tough, yet passionate – determined, yet caring.\nThat's how those she touched remember her. As a fighter who refused to let cancer get her down. As a fighter with a gentle heart. A fighter with a smile on her face.\n-- Anna Marum\namarum@oregonian.com\n503-294-5911\n@annamarum", "external_links": ["http://www.4nathalie.com/donate/", "https://kickasps.wordpress.com/", "https://twitter.com/annamarum"], "published": "2015-10-10T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:22:55.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
