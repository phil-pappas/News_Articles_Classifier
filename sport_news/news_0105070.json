He spent the previous 11 seasons at North Dakota State, where he racked up a 104-32 record, with his final three teams winning the FCS national championship. \nOFFENSE \nYardage hasnt necessarily been tough to come by for Wyoming, but the points have. The Cowboys are averaging 396.3 yards per game, 71st nationally, but are scoring just 20.3 points per game, 112th nationally. Their lack of red zone success is a big reason why  they have scored on 55.6 percent of their chances (15-of-27), dead last in the nation. \nBohl has stressed a powerful run game, and thats what he has with sophomore running back Brian Hill, who is fourth in FBS with 985 rushing yards. He is on pace to break the school single-season record of 1,455 yards. \nThe line has opened running lanes, but it has allowed 19 sacks. \nSenior quarterback Cameron Coffman is making the most of his one shot after transferring from Indiana. Coffman has completed 66.1 percent of his passes for 1,504 yards with 14 touchdowns, all best in the Mountain West. Junior wide receiver Tanner Gentry (678 yards on 37 catches) is his top target, but is unlikely to play Saturday. Six-foot-6 junior Jake Maulhardt has been a solid possession-type presence with 36 catches for 366 yards. \nDEFENSE \nThe Cowboys are allowing 32 points per game, tied for 10th in the Mountain West. Opponents have had success running the ball on Wyoming, which is yielding 218.6 ypg on the ground. Creating turnovers has been an issue, as the Cowboys have just four takeaways all season (only Troy has gained fewer). Opponents 43.3 conversion percentage on third downs is 105th in the nation. \nSenior end Eddie Yarbrough is an NFL-level talent anchoring the Cowboys line in their 4-3 system, with three of the teams five sacks this season. His 17.5 career sacks are tied for 11th among active FBS players. He and true freshman safety Andrew Dewey Wingard have five tackles for loss apiece. Wingard leads the team with 60 tackles. \nJunior linebacker Lucas Wacha, brother of St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Michael Wacha, has 52 tackles and is expected to play Saturday after missing the Nevada win with a concussion. Redshirt freshman safety Marcus Epps has two of the Cowboys three interceptions. \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nEvery kick has been an adventure. Freshman Tristan Bailey is 1-of-7 on field goal attempts and 17-of-19 on extra points. Gentry is the primary punt returner, with 10.4 yards per return. Junior D.J. May is averaging 32.6 yards per kickoff return, third best in the nation. Junior punter Ethan Wood is 24th nationally with 44.2 yards per punt. \nDID YOU KNOW? \nLegendary sportscaster Curt Gowdy attended Wyoming, where he played basketball. A large state park is named after him, located between Laramie and his hometown, Cheyenne.
