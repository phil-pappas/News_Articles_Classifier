Instead the Bubblers, ranked eighth in District 3 AA power rankings, took the game as an opportunity to get revenge for the Sept. 22 result. The Bubblers scored the first three goals and took all the points in a decisive 3-1 win. kAm%96 qF33=6CD’ |2EE {J @A6?65 E96 @AA@D:E:@?’D 244@F?E H:E9 2 8@2= 2DD:DE65 3J y2C65 qCJ>6DD6C :?
