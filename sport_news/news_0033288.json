Richard implied that had everyone gone to the huddle they would have gotten the correct call. \n“Get to the huddle,’’ he said, when asked what needs to happen to prevent a similar misunderstanding in the future. “We get to the huddle, we get our call from to the MIKE linebacker, we give ourselves a good chance to compete.’’ \nAsked if everyone huddled up, Richard said “it didn’t seem like it.’’ \nRichard said the call did not change at any point so there should have been no confusion. \nMembers of the secondary after the game huddled for a while in the locker room talking through what happened. \nRichard said he was encouraged by that response. \n“The last thing that we ever want to be in regards to the secondary is the problem,’’ Richard said. “We’ve always wanted to be the solution and help this football team in any way that we possibly can so ultimately when a play happens in the light that it did at the end and it comes down to a lack of our execution, that hit home. It hit home. So it’s very encouraging because it showed how much they cared, how much they care about this team and how much they care about getting right and doing things right.’’ \nRichard also said he is confident that the team will turn around its pattern of fourth-quarter fades. \n“Nothing is being called different,” he said of the fourth quarters. “We’ve got a plan and from play one all the way to the last play we’ve got a plan and our whole intent is to come out and do our best to execute that plan.” \nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bcondotta .
