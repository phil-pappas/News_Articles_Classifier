Scott, who did not play in the first half, also scored on a 1-yard run to help the Spartans (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) win their 10th straight game. They overcame an impressive return by suspended Rutgers senior receiver Leonte Carroo, who caught three touchdowns. Connor Cook ompleted 23 of 38 passes for a season-high 357 yards — one less than his career best — and two touchdowns. He came up with a 29-yard third-down pass to R.J. Shelton on third down on the winning 76-yard drive. Chris Laviano and Carroo, who was reinstated Wednesday after simple assault charges were dropped from a Sept. 12 incident outside the stadium, combined on TD passes of 5, 39 and 28 for the Scarlet Knights (2-3, 0-2). \nNo. 18 Michigan 38, No. 13 Northwestern 0 \nANN ARBOR, MICH. \nJehu Chesson returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown and Michigan scored on offense and defense to build a four-touchdown lead by halftime. The Wolverines (5-1, 2-0 Big Ten) have won five straight since their opening loss at Utah under coach Jim Harbaugh, building momentum going into a showdown at home next week against No. 4 Michigan State. The Wildcats (5-1, 1-1) were giving up a nation-low seven points a game and gave that up 13 seconds after kickoff. They allowed a season-high 21 points in the first quarter alone and struggled on offense, too. Michigan has shut out three straight opponents for the first time since 1980. The Wolverines scored TDs on a kickoff return, interception and offense for the first time since 1991 at Boston College, according to STATS. With a homecoming crowd already fired up, Chesson kept them buzzing when he raced across the field and up the sideline untouched for a score that seemed to stun the Wildcats. Michigan ran for scores on its first two possessions on Drake Johnson’s 1-yard plunge and Jake Rudock’s 2-yard scramble to make it 21-0 late in the first quarter. Jourdan Lewis picked off a pass late in the second quarter and returned it 37 yards for a score. Kenny Allen kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal to cap the Wolverines’ opening drive in the second half, giving them a 31-0 lead. Michigan padded the cushion with Derrick Green’s 4-yard TD run that ended a 12-play possession that took 7-plus minutes off the clock. Michigan’s only setback was senior linebacker James Ross’ ejection for targeting. Ross, a key reserve, will have to sit out the first half next week against the Spartans. Rudock passed a test against a highly touted defense, completing 17 of 23 passes for 179 yards without a turnover. Howland High School graduate De’Veon Smith had eight carries for 59 yards, after missing a game with an injured right ankle, and likely would’ve played more if the game was close. \nWisconsin 23, Nebraska 21 \nLINCOLN, NEB. \nThe Badgers’ Rafael Gaglianone made a 46-yard field goal with four seconds left after missing from 39 yards just over a minute earlier as Wisconsin beat Nebraska. Fullback Andy Janovich broke a 55-yard touchdown run with 3:38 left to give Nebraska the lead, but the Cornhuskers (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) for the second straight week couldn’t put away their opponent. All four of Nebraska’s losses have come on its opponent’s final offensive play. The Huskers, protecting a one-point lead, played it safe after Gaglianone hit the right upright with his field-goal try with 1:26 left. Wisconsin (4-2, 1-1) got the ball back at its 30 with 1:03 to play and drove to the Nebraska 28, where Gaglianone lined up for his game-winner on third down. Dare Ogunbowale rushed for 117 yards, most coming after starting Wisconsin running back Taiwan Deal went out with an injury to his left ankle in the first quarter. Joel Stave was 25 of 50 for 322 yards and a touchdown for the Badgers. \nNo. 22 Iowa 29, Illinois 20 \nIOWA CITY, IOWA \nJordan Canzeri rushed for 256 yards on a school-record 43 carries and Iowa held off Illinois for its sixth straight win. C.J. Beathard had 200 yards passing and two TD for the Hawkeyes (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten). They’ve already taken down four Power Five opponents heading into next week’s game against No. 13 Northwestern. Canzeri’s 75-yard touchdown run put Iowa ahead 23-13 late in the third quarter. Geronimo Allison pulled Illinois back within three on a 53-yard TD reception, but freshman Ke’Shawn Vaughn’s fumble with 3:09 left doomed the Illini. Wes Lunt threw for 317 yards and a touchdown for Illinois (4-2, 1-1). \nPenn State 29, Indiana 7 \nSTATE COLLEGE, PA. \nChristian Hackenberg threw for 262 yards, two touchdown passes, ran for two more and Penn State beat Indiana. Hackenberg was 21 of 39 and hit Brandon Polk and DaeSean Hamilton on 39-yard scoring strikes and turned a bootleg into a 1-yard touchdown run for a 19-7 halftime lead. He scrambled for a 5-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter and Tyler Davis kicked a 30-yard field goal to cap the scoring. Zander Diamont scored on a 12-yard run for the Hoosiers (4-2, 1-2 Big Ten) but completed just 9 of 17 passes for 90 yards before he was injured and replaced by third-stringer Danny Cameron in the third quarter. Cameron didn’t fare any better against Penn State’s defense. Senior defensive end Carl Nassib forced two fumbles and finished with two sacks. Austin Johnson and Garrett Sickels each had a sack and the Nittany Lions (5-1, 2-0) forced six 3-and-outs. \nMinnesota 41, Purdue 13 \nWEST LAFAYETTE, IND. \nShannon Brooks ran for 176 yards and changed the game with a 71-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter to help Minnesota break out of its offensive funk. Brooks had only 20 carries for 115 yards coming into the game. But his long run on the second play of the second half got the FBS’ second-worst scoring team started. Minnesota (4-2, 1-1 Big Ten) had 28 points in the quarter — more than it scored in any of its previous five games. Purdue (1-5, 0-2) has lost four straight overall, eight in a row in league play and has two wins over FBS foes under third-year coach Darrell Hazell. Minnesota quarterback Mitch Leidner was 8 of 12 for 59 yards with two TDs. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:44:43.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
