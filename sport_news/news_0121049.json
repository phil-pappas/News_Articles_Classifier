All four of Nebraska's losses have come on its opponent's final offensive play. \nThe Huskers, protecting a one-point lead, played it safe after Gaglianone hit the right upright with his field-goal try with 1:26 left. Wisconsin (4-2, 1-1) got the ball back at its 30 with 1:03 to play and drove to the Nebraska 28, where Gaglianone lined up for his game-winner on third down. \nDare Ogunbowale rushed for 117 yards, most coming after starting Wisconsin running back Taiwan Deal went out with an injury to his left ankle in the first quarter. Joel Stave was 25 of 50 for 322 yards and a touchdown for the Badgers. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:41:23.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
