He will take charge of JCTC, which has been forced to cut more than $6 million in expenses over the past two years amid sharp declines in community college enrollment, on Jan. 1, replacing outgoing president Tony Newberry.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nCommunity colleges suffer as economy improves\nHandy said he is excited to join a campus that has made a “major commitment” to improving student success rates and is optimistic about the future of the college enrollment.\nSome of the enrollment declines, he said, can be attributed to an “insidious national conversation” that causes young adults to question the value of a college degree.\n“I’m afraid what’s going to happen is a generation of students who’ve decided not to go to college is going to wake up here in the next few years,” he said. “They’re going to be getting married, starting families and they’re going to look at the jobs they’ve been able to get, and they’re going to go, ‘Oh my goodness, I’ve got to go back to school.’”\nCommunity colleges like JCTC, which are affordable and won’t leave students drowning in student loan debt, will be the place many young adults decide to turn, he said. He also has faith in national, state and local initiatives seeking to increase college-going rates.\n\"I feel good about where we're positioned,\" he said. \"The trick is to make sure that we've adjusted our expense patterns appropriately so when the tide does turn ... we're positioned well to manage that growth and grow appropriately.\"\nJCTC Board of Directors Chairwoman Lynn Fischer said Handy has solid experience fundraising, which has not historically been a large part of the college president's role. But \"because our annual appropriations from state have been declining for 11 years, we really must be looking at many alternative sources of capital for some of the big-vision dreams that we have,\" she said.\nFischer said the board was looking for someone who would be a \"transformational leader\" for JCTC, someone who could oversee the college's efforts to improve completion rates for students, foster educational partnerships, prepare students for the workforce and lead upcoming \"major changes\" to the Broadway campus, which she said could include a new building for the advanced manufacturing and information technology programs and upgrades to the technical campus on 6th and Chestnut streets.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nJCTC president says he will retire June 30\nThe board was impressed by Handy's depth of experience and his knowledge about JCTC and Louisville, she said.\nHandy, who met his wife, Kimberly, at Western Kentucky University, has several existing ties to the Louisville area. He served as chancellor of Ivy Tech Community College’s Sellersburg campus. His youngest son lives in Louisville, a city he said he is looking forward to working and living in.\n“I’m really excited about this opportunity,” he said. “… I look forward not just to Jefferson but also to the entire Louisville community.”\nReporter Kirsten Clark can be reached at (502) 582-4144.
