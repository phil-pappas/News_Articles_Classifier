There was a mass exodus of fans when the lead grew to 42-0 at halftime, and the ones who remained began a “fire Muschamp” chant that echoed throughout the stadium. \nThe scene in the locker room after the game, however, was far less noisy. \n“It was bad,” Keanu Neal said. “It was quiet, you could sense guys kind of losing hope, giving up.” \nPoole remembered a similar atmosphere. \n“There was not a whole lot to be said,” Poole said. “I mean, [Missouri] came out and dominated us from start to finish.” \nThat game was the beginning of the end for Muschamp and one of the main catalysts for the change that brought in Jim McElwain as head coach a few months later. \nAnd while McElwain obviously doesn’t have any personal memories of that contest, the loss has been on the minds of Florida’s players throughout this week. \nIn fact, a few players’ have had this Saturday’s game highlighted since the start of the season. \n“That was probably the lowest point of the year,” defensive lineman Alex McCalister said about the 2014 contest. “That was homecoming, we came in and just let that team take everything from us. \n“It’s definitely a big game [this year]. It was a big game on my calendar, going to Missouri and really taking it back from them.” \nIt’s difficult to say if that will translate into Saturday’s game, but coach Jim McElwain says he can tell the team has had good energy in practices and meetings this week. \n“There was a pretty good sense of urgency,” McElwain said. “What it tells me is they’re looking forward to the opportunity. I don’t think they’re taking it lightly.” \nCoincidently, this year’s Florida-Missouri matchup happens to fall the Tigers’ homecoming weekend. Most of the players weren’t aware of that fact until this week, but they weren’t unhappy about it. \n“That’s even more perfect,” McCalister said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:48:12.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
