We made some changes and got more into the game and we kept the ball more. \n\"You can see that when we believe in ourselves, and we dare to play football, we are a good team and that's what we have to do more. \n\"We have to really go for it and play our system and defend as high up the pitch as possible. \n\"Sometimes you have to get deeper but we have to keep the ball more. \n\"But we finished well with some good passing and good crossing situations in their half.\" \nMolde, who beat Fenerbahce 3-1 in the group opener, drew 1-1 against Ajax to leave them top of the group with four points. \nThe Norwegian outfit are two points ahead of Celtic and the Dutch side and their next two games are a double-header against the Hoops. \nDeila said: \"Yes, I am a little bit disappointed that we didn't win, but I am happy that we got a point and the group is still very open. \n\"We have to take the positive things as well. I am very happy with Kieran Tierney in his (European) debut, Scott Brown was fantastic in the midfield and worked really hard and James Forrest - what a difference we can see in him from half a year ago. \n\"So there are positive things there. \n\"But for me, I want to see us more on the ball, I want to see us braver on the ball to develop our own play and that is going to be the key for the future.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:36:58.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
