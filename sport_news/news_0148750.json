Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts doubled to right field in the first inning. David Ortiz then smacked a double off the wall in left-center, giving the Red Sox (78-84) an early 1-0 lead.\nThe Indians (81-80) responded in the second and third innings, and Salazar cruised from there.\n\"I thought it was a good finish for Danny,\" said Indians manager Terry Francona. \"I didn't want him to throw 120 pitches today. But I thought he did a good job.\"\nRoberto Perez doubled to left field off of Red Sox starting pitcher Rick Porcello (9-15) in the second inning and Giovanny Urshela followed with a single up the middle to tie it at 1.\nIn the third, Michael Martinez led off with a double to left field and Lonnie Chisenhall singled, putting runners at the corners. Porcello then gave the Indians a 2-1 lead with an error on a pick-off attempt and Jesus Aguilar added an RBI-single to left, making it 3-1.\nCody Allen earned his 34th save and recorded his 99th strikeout.\nThe final regular season attendance was 1,388,905 -- the lowest in Progressive/Jacobs Field history. That number, though, does include several make-up doubleheaders and the loss of one home game, a rainout against Detroit that wasn't rescheduled.\nSunday's win allowed the Indians to finish the season over .500 after a slow April that at one point put them in last place in the division.\n\"I told our guys today that one, I really appreciate that group in there,\" Francona said. \"They fought so hard to make our season be a positive, because we really were having a tough time. And that takes a lot of will and it takes a lot of caring and a lot of fight. And, yeah, we didn't do enough. But from where we were, we did some good things. And the hope is that you build off of that.\"\nSaid Francisco Lindor, a candidate for AL Rookie of the Year, \"It hurts that we didn't make the playoffs. But we've got so many years to come and hopefully we've got many years in the playoffs and we'll win it one day.\"\n(c)2015 Akron Beacon Journal (Akron, Ohio)\nVisit the Akron Beacon Journal (Akron, Ohio) at www.ohio.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1732590&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1732590&h=Danny+Salazar+ends+on+high+note+as+Indians+finish+81%2D80", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1732590"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:16:14.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
