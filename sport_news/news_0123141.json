The SAFE Act mandated that all such weapons had to be registered by April 2014 and could not be sold or transferred within the state. \nThe compliance date came and went with little fanfare, and this past June the state was forced by a lawsuit to admit that just 44,485 have been registered. \nThat number, hidden from the public for more than a year by state officials, was given to Rochester-area lawyer Paloma Capanna in response to a lawsuit she filed on behalf of radio host Bill Robinson. \nThe state contended that the contents of the registration database is exempt from public disclosure, but Capanna argued that it should be public information, like handgun licenses. \nThat means that somewhere between 95 and 97 percent of the state’s “assault weapons” owners have not registered their guns and are thus liable for felony charges. What is being done about it? \nA better question is what can be done? The state has no way of knowing who owns the affected guns, or how many. \nThe state can either continue to ignore the situation or repeal that aspect of the SAFE Act. Fat chance of that. \nOne has to guess that there will be some kind of negotiations that will allow the state to save face. \nGroton maintains trap lead \nScott Batzer and Don Nickerson both turned in perfect scores at Trumansburg last week to lead their Groton team to a 245 total, keeping it two birds ahead of the field after two weeks of the Cayuga Lake Trap League \nDryden’s John Stanley and Newfield’s Ted Labar had the only other 50s among the 124 shooters who took part. Newfield tied Groton for high team score of 245, and Dryden shot 244 to maintain second place in the standings. \nMark Patton of Dryden broke 48, keeping him in a tie for the league individual lead with Stanley and Batzer at 98. \nYouth pheasant hunt \nOrganizer Larry Shutts notes that there are still a couple of openings for this weekend’s Youth Pheasant Hunt, sponsored by the Conservation Alliance of New York. \nLicensed 12- to 15-year-old hunters who can be accompanied by a non-hunting adult are eligible for the hunt, which will be held at the Molyneau Tree Farm on Sherder Road, off Route 38B between Newark Valley and Endicott. \nAnyone interested should contact Shutts at (607) 642-8609. \nWolves act canceled \nWolves of the World, one of the primary wildlife acts for this weekend’s ninth annual Southern Tier Outdoor Show in Bath, has canceled due to an emergency in the exhibitor’s family. \nEagle falconry will put on two shows to help fill the schedule, and Maxman Reptile Rescue has agreed to fill in with three shows daily. \nHenderson's outdoors columns appear Thursday and his Field Notes columns on Sunday.
