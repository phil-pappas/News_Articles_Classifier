Austin in the Battle of the Piney Woods, two schools that took the names of two of the most important figures in Texas history, it was just another game; one played at a neutral site at Reliant Stadium, home of the NFL’s Houston Texans, in front of 25,000 fans, but another game all the same.\nNow here he is in the middle of a bitter rivalry that began at the FCS level and may have more weight than ever with both programs vying for bowl eligibility for the first time since moving to the FBS.\nBut to Fritz, the Mountaineers of Appalachian State are no different from the Mountaineers of West Virginia.\n“I want to win them all,” Fritz said. “I told the guys, this game is worth one just like last week and just like next week. You’ve got to have that kind of mentality if you want to win a bunch of ball games.”\nThis is, of course, all new to Fritz, a fact he reminded the media of during his postgame press conference after the Eagles’ 56-26 win over New Mexico State, when he was asked what he expected from his first trip to Boone, North Carolina, where Appalachian State will host Georgia Southern for a Thursday night game to be televised on ESPNU.\n“It’s my first trip to a lot of places,” he said.\nThat trip is unlikely to change his perspective about this rivalry, or any rivalry for that matter. Right now, he has a team to coach and a game to win.\nGreat history between teams\nAppalachian State coach Scott Satterfield seems to have just the opposite mentality as Fritz, and perhaps that’s because he knows the Mountaineers have home-field advantage.\nSatterfield released a letter Tuesday to the Mountaineer fan base, imploring fans to make their best efforts to pack Kidd Brewer Stadium.\n“We have the opportunity to become bowl eligible,” Satterfield said in the letter. “To add to the excitement and importance of Thursday night, the team standing in our way is none other than our longtime rival, Georgia Southern.”\nSatterfield has been around this football feud for a long time. He started 27 games at quarterback for Appalachian State from 1992 to 1995, then served as an assistant coach from 1998 to 2008. He returned as an assistant in 2012 before taking the head job in 2013.\nHe led the Mountaineers to a 27-17 win over the Eagles in his senior year and an undefeated regular-season record, and as a coach he was part of two App State squads that upset a top-ranked GSU team. Eight times in his career as an App State assistant, the game between the Eagles and Mountaineers was decided by 7 points or less, with one going into double overtime.\n“We had some great games back in the FCS,” Satterfield said during a phone interview. “We were playing for No. 1 or the conference championship back in the Southern Conference. There’s been a lot of great history.”\n‘Always a battle’\nThe players look like they’re buying in to Fritz’s philosophy, though it’s a little different for them, especially the seniors, who are 1-2 (or 1-3 for the redshirts) against the Mountaineers. They housed App State last season 34-14 on a Thursday night at Paulson Stadium, a statement game that let the Sun Belt Conference know the Eagles were a contender. It was payback for a 38-14 beating the Mountaineers handed the Eagles the year prior, but there hasn’t been any postseason implications attached to this game for two seasons. The last time for that was 2012 when GSU, ranked No. 1 in the FCS, hosted the Mountaineers and fell 31-28.\nThen in 2013, the Eagles were trying to exit the FCS on top as unofficial champions, when they traveled to Boone to play the 1-6 Mountaineers.\n“They beat us pretty bad,” GSU senior safety Matt Dobson said.\nThis season, both teams are 5-1 and unbeaten in the Sun Belt, and the winner could have the edge the rest of the season in the race for a conference title. Not only that, but these teams made the transition to FBS together, and Thursday’s winner will be the first to secure bowl eligibility.\nTrue, Dobson said, but both teams could be winless and the game would mean just as much.\n“It’s always a battle,” he said. “Doesn’t matter what the teams’ records are or who’s the favorite — you can throw all that out the window.\n“For the fans, I’m sure it’s just a little added excitement.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14825570.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14825569.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14825570.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14825569.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:07:20.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
