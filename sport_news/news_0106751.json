His name is Ant Righter and he's from Delaware County. \nPLUS: Giants' Tom Coughlin says Victor Cruz is still not cleared to practice \nRighter explained he rode the El back from Lincoln Financial Field with a group of Eagles fans that got more heated. Here's what led to the incident: \"They started saying worse stuff to me. I was ignoring them at first. And then I started saying stuff back. I had a hat in my back pocket, and [someone] took the hat and threw it on the ground. So I got mad. And I snapped out. He seemed like he was gonna fight me — the kid who grabbed my hat. Like anybody else would, I was pissed that he grabbed my property. So I did that [snapped out] and the kid walked away. And as I was walking away, and that's when I was looking behind me. They were still talking to me, saying a bunch of crap. Next thing I know, this guy came out of nowhere and hit me.\" \nYou can see in the first video above that after Righter's hat was taken, he begins jawing at the Eagles fans who took his hat. That's what led to the punch you can see in the second video. \nRighter did say he was drunk at the time but that having his hat thrown to the ground angered him: \"If I wasn't that intoxicated I probably could have controlled the situation, but stuff happens. But there's still no right, I should be able to go to game in a Giants jersey and not get punched. After the guy grabbed my hat, I did get mad. And I was drunk, and I did snap out. There was no excuse, I was drunk. After the kid took my hat, I walked away. Yeah, I was snapping on him. He probably would have snapped on me too, if I took his hat. If anyone says they wouldn't do that, they're lying.\" \nRighter also said he suffered no injuries in the scuffle. \nFollow Charles Curtis on Twitter @charlescurtis82 .
