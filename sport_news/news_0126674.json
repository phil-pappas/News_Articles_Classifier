We've had a great month so far.\" \nFayetteville is now just three victories from tying its single-season program record for wins. Ella May Powell had 36 assists in the win, while Warner added six aces. Olivia Wales recorded 15 digs, Abbie Kathol had 13 digs, eight kills and five aces and Faith Waitsman added eight kills of her own. \nFayetteville broke open a 10-8 game in the first set with a 10-2, Warner-led run en route to the 25-16 win. Fayetteville led 5-4 early in the second game then used a 14-1 run to take control of the 25-9 win. The third set was more of the same with Fayetteville using a 10-1 run to turn an 8-7 deficit into a big lead as its hitters dominated at the net to close out the match in a 25-15 win. \n\"For us, it's about getting a little better every night,\" Phelan said. \"And we put ourselves in really good position going into our last two conference matches and the state tournament.\" \nDesiree Mack's nine kills led Springdale, which was without sophomore libero Elaina Pack. Springdale will likely have its best chance to earn a conference win Thursday when it hosts Fort Smith Northside for Senior Night before closing the season at Springdale Har-Ber. \n\"I hope we finish strong on senior night and Har-Ber night,\" Springdale coach Kylie Moad said. \nFayetteville will host Fort Smith Southside on Thursday. \nSports on 10/14/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:04:12.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
