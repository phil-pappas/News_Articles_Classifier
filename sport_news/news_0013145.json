She broke a tie with Pro Stock Motorcycle racer Angelle Sampey for the female record. Sampey set the mark in 2001. \n\"I have been talking about a cowboy hat for months — wanting to come here and win a cowboy hat — so I'm excited to be able to get that done in front of all of our friends and family,\" Enders said. \"It's just a huge blessing. You know I didn't drive my best in the final round and my guys stepped up to the plate and picked up my slack, so I'm so appreciative to them. We just have such great team chemistry and great horsepower so I'm a happy girl.\" \nShe extended her points lead to 154 over Greg Anderson with two events left in the NHRA Mello Yello Countdown to the Championship. \nRichie Crampton won in Top Fuel, Del Worsham in Funny Car, and Jerry Savoie in Pro Stock Motorcycle. \nCrampton raced to his fifth victory of the year, beating Steve Torrence with a 3.972 at 283.07.
