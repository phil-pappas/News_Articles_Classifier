The whiffs, head coach Hugh Freeze said, were “as bad as I’ve ever seen.” Defensive coordinator Dave Wommack called the performance “ridiculous.” \nFreeze also discussed the team's injuries and not being locked in. \nSafety Trae Elston was upset with the lack of tackling but pointed to something larger as an explanation for why the Rebels (5-2, 2-1 SEC) were upset on the road for a second time in three weeks. \n“I think Memphis came out to play,” he said. “I think they outphysicaled us, they played harder than us, they wanted to win better than us. We’ve just got to check ourselves. A lot of the people on our team, we didn’t have our heart into it.” \nThe Rebels built a 14-0 lead with 9:44 remaining in the first quarter but allowed the Tigers (6-0, 2-0 American Athletic Conference) to score 31 consecutive points. Ole Miss rallied late, drawing within seven points in the third quarter, but couldn’t complete the comeback. \nThe Rebels fell to 0-2 in games they’ve trailed at halftime this season and 4-11 in such games under Freeze. Combined with their 38-10 blowout loss to Florida on Oct. 3, the Rebels have been outscored 49-14 in the first halves of their two losses this season. \n“Hopefully, I do a better job than I did at Florida,” Freeze said last week when asked how he can make sure the Rebels start well. “We need to make sure we feel really good about those first few calls, and that our kids feel confident again. But hopefully we have a few successful plays early.” \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com.
