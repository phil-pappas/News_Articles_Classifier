He completed 5 of 9 passes for 49 yards and a touchdown in those games. \nThen when UW lost starter Joel Stave (head) with 1 minute 37 seconds left in the first quarter, Houston had to run the offense for the rest of the game. \nHe responded to that challenge by completing 22 of 32 attempts (68.8%) for 232 yards. He had two end-zone interceptions that no doubt didn't sit well with coach Paul Chryst, but he also had critical touchdown passes of 23 yards to Robert Wheelwright and 9 yards to Alex Erickson. \nThe first score helped UW take a 7-3 lead early in the second quarter. The second was the clincher as UW built its lead to 24-13 with 9:42 remaining. \n\"He enjoyed getting the chance to go play,\" Chryst said. \"It didn't seem too big for him. I thought he competed.\" OFFENSIVE PLAY OF THE GAME \nUW was clinging to a 17-13 lead but was in the Illinois red zone, facing a tricky third-and-goal from the 9. \nErickson had eight catches for 79 yards to that point. That included three catches for 33 yards and three first downs on the drive, each coming on third down. \nYou would think the Illini would pay extra attention to Erickson. \nErickson and tight end Troy Fumagalli lined up to the left for UW. Fumagalli ran an outside route; Erickson cut to the inside against strong safety Taylor Barton. \nErickson had a step or two on Barton and Houston hit him with a bullet pass for an easy touchdown. DEFENSIVE PLAY OF THE GAME \nUW's defense limited the Illini, who entered the day averaging 28.5 points per game, to one touchdown and two field goals through three quarters. \nThen after UW's offense put together a 65-yard touchdown drive to take an 11-point lead, Dave Aranda's defense made a critical stop to snuff the Illini's attempted retort. \nQuarterback Wes Lunt hit wide receiver Dionte Taylor for 15 yards to the Illinois 40 on the second play of the possession to stir the crowd one last time. \nLunt dropped back to pass on the next play and tried to hit wide receiver Geronimo Allison, who had seven catches for 68 yards to that point. UW inside linebacker T.J. Edwards dropped into coverage, however, and tipped the ball high and over the 6-foot-4 Allison. \nSafety Michael Caputo came flying up from the secondary and made a diving interception to give UW the ball at the UW 49 with 9:07 remaining. \nIllinois got the ball back twice, but didn't come close to scoring and UW had a victory that was earned. SPECIAL TEAMS PLAY OF THE GAME \nUW punter Drew Meyer has quietly put together a solid senior season, but he was at his best Saturday. \nMeyer punted five times and averaged 46.8 yards. He had a long effort of 57 yards and placed three punts inside the Illinois 20. \nHis most important punt of the game might have been his first. \nIllinois got the ball first and moved from its 27 to the UW 45. Ryan Frain's 32-yard punt pinned UW at its 13 and the Badgers lost a total of 3 yards on three plays. \nOn came Meyer to punt from his end zone. \nA bad punt would give the Illini excellent field position and early momentum. \nInstead, Meyer hit a 53-yarder to the Illinois 37. V'Angelo Bentley returned the punt 16 yards but a holding call pushed the Illini back to their 35. \nThat turn of events prevented Illinois from building off the early momentum established by the defense. INSIDE THE HUDDLE \n■The UW staff made a change on the field-goal unit, apparently in response to seeing Nebraska almost block one field-goal attempt and seeing Purdue block a 35-yard attempt one week later. Both opponents attacked the left side of the UW formation, and Zander Neuville replaced tight end Eric Steffes as the wing on that side. Rafael Gaglianone made his only field-goal attempt, from 26 yards, and all three extra-point attempts. \n■UW's kickoff-return unit was beaten badly by the Illini. Natrell Jamerson came in averaging 19.3 yards per return but averaged only 16.0 on Saturday. That average was bolstered by a 31-yard return. His other three returns were for 9, 11 and 13 yards. The Badgers started their drives after the three short returns at their 11, 21 and 14. QUOTE \n\"I'm proud of the way the guys kept playing. You never know how each game goes. ... Guys stepped in. Guys stepped up.\" \nUW coach Paul Chryst, on his team's ability to overcome injuries BY THE NUMBERS \n2 Turnovers forced by UW, which had forced only nine in the first seven games \n5½ Tackles for loss by Illini linemen \n56.3% UW's third-down conversion rate (9 of 16) \n177 Offensive yards for UW's Alex Erickson — 96 receiving and 81 rushing \n232 Passing yards for UW's Bart Houston UP NEXT \nRutgers (3-3, 1-2 Big Ten) at Wisconsin (6-2, 3-1), 11 a.m. Saturday \nThe Scarlet Knights, who hosted No. 1 Ohio State on Saturday night, went 1-2 during the recent three-game suspension of head coach Kyle Flood. School officials suspended Flood after a university investigation found he had improper contact with an instructor regarding the academic status of a player. Rutgers rallied from a 25-point deficit to stun Indiana, 55-52, in Flood's first game back. \nJeff Potrykus © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
