The Eagles entered tied for first in the league with West Carteret and needed to beat the Wildcats for a second time this season to stay that way. That mission was taken care of as West Craven won in three-straight sets, 25-19, 25-22 and 25-17. Senior Erin Gray was a force for West Craven with 10 kills, four service points and a pair of aces. Carson Jones chipped in nine kills and also contributed four service points. “Erin was fantastic tonight and she took her game to another level,” West Craven coach Sheila Holloway said. “We had great energy tonight and our student section was awesome and they really add another element to our energy on the court.” It was a boisterous scene in the gym as one may have thought it was a basketball game with closed eyes. A key moment came in the second set, with West Craven having game point up 24-22. Senior libero Rendi Wetherington delivered a kill to close the set and give the Eagles a 2-0 cushion. “That set was definitely big and I thought that if we lost that set, we’d probably end up going five,” Holloway said. “We still have a lot of business to take care of but this win definitely puts us in a good position in the conference.” The Eagles had gone five sets back in September to beat Richlands on the road. The Wildcats handed West Carteret its lone conference loss and West Carteret knocked off West Craven earlier in the year. Megan Toler, Taylor Bryan and Abby Morris led the way in service points for West Craven with seven each. Brooke Monssen starred for Richlands with 13 kills and four service points. West Craven (11-6, 7-1 Coastal 3A) will host Jacksonville Thursday and then hosts West Carteret next Tuesday. Richlands falls to 9-7, 5-4 with the loss.
