Tough situations, offensive situations, defensive situations, it's part of the process,\" Hartley said.\nNaturally, the question had to be asked: Which of those needing to impress to be on the opening-night 23-man roster did it?\n\"Saying who I like, you do the math, your readers will know who we didn't like,\" Hartley said, too cagey to play his hand. \"I'd like to tell them by myself. We're not going to cut no one in the media tonight.\"\nLet's take a stab.\nVeteran winger Mason Raymond, in a dogfight for a bottom-six role at this point, was at his best in the first period, although he faded like the rest of the team.\nGoalie Joni Ortio could be credited for keeping the club within striking distance but the third goal allowed left something to be desired.\n\"We can't fault Joni for the defeat,\" Hartley said. \"The Jets were the better team. They executed better than us and they deserve the credit.\"\nAnd the defencemen vying for the sixth and seventh spots currently open due to injuries?\nWell, they all had some rough moments instead of finding a way to grab it.\n\"There's no sense losing sleep,\" said Ryan Wilson, the blueliner who's in camp on a tryout. \"It's gonna happen either way, so let the chips lay where they may and we'll see where we're at in the next couple of days.\"\nArguably the best player from start to finish was right-winger Garnet Hathaway, who's still likely ticketed for the minors due to the numbers game and a need for more pro experience. But the Brown University product moved himself up the depth chart.\n\"I got my legs moving well and got on the body better than I have in other games, that's my game,\" Hathaway said. \"And I got a couple scoring chances, took the puck to the net well.\n\"I worked my hardest out there and that's what's in my control. It's not up to me now. I want to help the team win and if they think I can, I will be here.\"\nDeryk Engelland scored the lone Calgary goal, while Mark Scheifele scored twice in a three-point outing to lead the Jets. Rookie top prospect Nikolaj Ehlers, the 2014 first-round draft pick, netted one goal and one assist.\nThe Flames also lost forward Joe Colborne early in the second when he was hit in the right hand while blocking Andrew Ladd's shot, and in turn, Ladd left the game after the second period due to injury.\nBoth the Flames and Jets close out the pre-season Saturday with another meeting in Calgary\nTHREE STARS\n1. LW Mason Raymond. Used his speed, especially in the first period, in his best pre-season outing, by far. Also played point on the powerplay.\n2. RW Garnet Hathaway. Likely headed ot the AHL very soon, but the undrafted winger out of the NCAA elevated his stock this camp.\n3. G Joni Ortio. A couple of goals were stoppable with a great save, but kept it tighter than it should have been in the second frame.\nrandy.sportak@sunmedia.ca\nwww.twitter.com/SUNRandySportak\nTop ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://www.twitter.com/SUNRandySportak", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:04:53.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
