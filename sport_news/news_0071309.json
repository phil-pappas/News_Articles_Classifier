Oklahoma set the tone early, taking only 1:04 to score on its opening drive on a 22-yard pass from Mayfield to Sterling Shepard. \n\"We had a great intensity coming into the game, and guys were fired up in the locker room,\" Shepard said. \"Everybody wanted to show what type of team we were because of last week's loss, so we did a great job with intensity and executing our jobs.\" \nThe Sooners took a 35-0 lead into halftime as Mayfield threw for all five of his TDs in the first half, including two to Shepard. He finished 20 of 27 for 282 yards. \nOklahoma kept rolling to open the second half. The Wildcats had benched Joe Hubener in favor of Kody Cook, who played most of the first half at wide receiver, and Cook promptly threw an interception that Zack Sanchez returned 38 yards for a touchdown that made the score 42-0. \n\"It's disappointing, that's a big word for it,\" Cook said. \"You're angry. You're disappointed. It's really frustrating. We obviously didn't expect to get shut out. We thought we had a pretty good game plan.\" \nThe Sooners tacked on two more field goals in the third quarter, and five minutes into the fourth quarter Joe Mixon scored the first rushing touchdown of the day for Oklahoma, stretching the lead to 55-0. \nMixon finished with 73 yards on 15 carries to lead a Sooners rushing attack that rolled up 232 yards. Mixon also caught three passes for 29 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter. \nThe dominating win came after Oklahoma's arduous trek to get to Manhattan. Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops said the Sooners left their facility at 2 p.m. Friday to drive to Oklahoma City and take a 40-minute flight to Manhattan but because of problems with various planes did not walk into their hotel rooms until 12:15 a.m. \nWaiting at the airport until late in the evening, Stoops said the support members of the program had to team up to deliver what amounted to a fast-food potluck so that players and coaches could have dinner. \n\"Try and get 10 burgers, 10 tacos, 10 — if everyone, if we had 10 people go out and get 10 whatever, we'd feed our players, and that's exactly what we did,\" Stoops said. \n\"Now the players want it every week,\" Stoops joked. \nMayfield said players were so focused that nothing could have distracted them from redeeming themselves from the 24-17 loss to the Longhorns. \n\"Our week of practice, I knew we were ready to come out and play, no matter what happened,\" Mayfield said. \"We could've stayed up all night and come out and been ready to play.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:12:21.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
