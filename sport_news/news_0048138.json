The best players on the one that returned, they got blocked. We're going to revisit that and some of the techniques and what we expect from our kickoff coverage. We'll address that pretty comfortably. The good news is we're down the road. It's something that surprised us. The length of the return certainly did. We recognize there's some things that need to get corrected and we're working on it.\"\nAny concerns about team being flat with small crowd?\n\"I so enjoyed that crowd. As much as I hate to admit it, I looked at the crowd very little. They sounded just like 100,000 to me. There's a very loyal contingent in that stadium that made a lot of noise and I enjoyed it. It was very much like Tiger Stadium.\"\nOn mixing up the plays, was that one of (offensive coordinator) Cam Cameron's better called games?\nIt's what we're going to do. Cam did a great job. Jeff Grimes did a really good job with the line with the suggestions he makes in the running game. It's what we're going to do, it's who we are. We had the opportunity to be pressed some. We're going to throw the football.\nLSU offense comes together in 45-24 rout of South Carolina | Vlog LSU beat writer Jim Kleinpeter and columnist Ron Higgins break down the Tigers' victory on Saturday.\nHow would you describe Derrius' (Guice) running style?\n\"He's pretty talented. Reckless might be the best (word). Angry. There's a number of ways to describe his running style. Efficient.\"\nDid Harris look more comfortable out of the shotgun?\n\"I think Harris does exactly what we ask him to do and looks really comfortable in both pieces. We're not going to as him to do something he's uncomfortable in, I promise.\nHow did the receivers look after last week?\n\"Last week was an unusual piece. We're really going to be a team that can count on being productive in the throwing game and count on those guys to make catches.\"\nWhat did you say to Steve Spurrier after the game?\n\"He's competitive, they kept scoring in the back end of the daggone game. It would have been a lot more fun for us if it hadn't. He kep calling plays that were good. He's a good coach, a quality, quality coach.\"\nTalk about Leonard jump starting the team again.\n\"I'd like to have us do that earlier, that second play of the second half. Great players make great plays. I think it's pretty obvious we're very talented at tailback, and certainly Leonard is one.\"\nWas Leonard hobbled at the end?\n\"No, we want to keep him fresh. He hits the one early in the second half and I'm sitting there thinking 'Let's get him out of there.'\"\nWhat did J.D. Moore's injury do to the game plan?\n\"It didn't really effect us much. The good news is it's not a serious issue. I liked (BryKeithon) Mouton. I liked him before and we have some other guys that can step in if J.D. misses some time.\"\nIs Darrel (Williams) as an upback something you've done before?\n\"Absolutely. And Darrel is another one who can really play a variety of roles.\"\nLSU guard Will Clapp says taking the fight to the defense fits the Tigers' style | Video After struggling to get Fournette free early, the LSU line wore South Carolina down\nDid you make the decision to go with the short kickoffs?\n\"I felt like we had some specialty kicks and it was a good time to try it. It put us in position to see how we can stop their return later. We hit hit a couple specialty kicks and hit one deep.\"\nWhat are the specialty kicks designed to do?\n\"To change the timing of a return. Two, to make and give question to who's supposed to field the ball. And three, if we can get a fiar catch by one of the fielders, that would be something we would be for. I think some of those were successful.\"\nHow did Brandon handle the two-minute at end of first half?\n\"It's what we do Monday and what we do on Thursday. He looked just like he does on Monday and Thursday. He handled the call. He's kind of calm under pressure. he sees it. He's put himself into 'I just want to play this call.' It allows him to have success and not be subject to the situation.\"\nOn the coverage busts, how does Jalen Mills help with communication?\n\"It would be nice to get him back for the Florida game. He practiced this week. It will be interesting to see if he's ready to go.\"\nWill he be?\n\"I don't know. I really shouldn't have mentioned it. But I felt I needed to after Shea's (Dixon) seven straight questions. . . here's a couple people over here with their hands raised. But I understand , it's what I'm supposed to do.\"\nAny chance he could have played in this game?\n\"Shea, what do you think?\"\nIs it getting the point where it's surprising when Fournette doesn't hit a home run?\n\"I'm not going to supposed that a great back would hit home runs every game. If you look at some of the great sluggers in baseball, they don't hit a home run every time they play a game. He does the things we ask him to do. We have ball security, he runs hard, if he misses a cut or gets tackled,you know what? I'm going to take those plays along with the other great plays and not expect too much. If I get to expecting too much I should put another back in. Let him takes some snaps and see how he does.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:39:48.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
