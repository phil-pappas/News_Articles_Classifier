I wish him the best.” \nLong, who started five games for the Orange as a freshman in 2014, threw for 935 yards and four touchdowns a season ago, including a career-high 307-yard, two-touchdown performance against North Carolina State. \nA Bethlehem, Pa., native, Long, who transferred to Friendship Christian prior to his junior year of high school, led the Commanders to a pair of state championships in 2012 and 2013, garnering Tennessean All-Midstate and Division II-A Mr. Football Back of the Year honors as a senior in 2013.
