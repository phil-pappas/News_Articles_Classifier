But the Slaters prevailed 2-0 on Sept. 12 on a pair of goals by Emme Lentine. \nBangor wasn’t quite as offensive-minded on Wednesday and Slaters coach Lisa Kienzle was quick to point that out. \n\"We didn’t shoot the ball,” Kienzle said. “We had four shots on goal. You can’t expect to score goals if you don’t shoot the ball.” \nKienzle was mystified as to why her team was so lackadaisical against a big rival. \n“I’m not quite sure why,” she said. “We had corners and opportunities in the circle. We just didn’t get enough shots off.” \nBangor had several furious thrusts in the final minutes, but was unable to dent the cage against Pen Argyl goalkeeper Kasey Hanlon. \n“We got pretty frantic in the second half, and that’s not a good thing,” Kienzle said. “We can’t play like that.” \nTo compound matters, star midfielder Cheyenne Ott was injured with 1:07 left in the game and had to be assisted off the field. Kienzle is keeping her fingers crossed that it’s nothing serious. \n“It was her hamstring,” Kienzle said. “We’re hoping for the best. She’s a quick healer.” \nOtt, who’s Bangor’s top scorer with 16 goals and 15 assists, was frustrated for much of the game by Pen Argyl’s Dana Evans . \nAfter a scoreless first half, Pen Argyl (9-5, 9-4) struck just 30 seconds into the second half when Lacey Hempeler knocked a shot past Slaters goalie Morgan Pysher for the game’s only goal. \n“We didn’t pressure the ball,” Kienzle said. “We gave them a lot of space, and they got a shot off. It came back to bite us.” \nAll things considered, it’s been a memorable year for Bangor. The Slaters have already qualified for the District 11 playoffs and are virtually a lock to make the league’s postseason tournament. \n“I’m definitely disappointed about what happened today, but it’s been a great season,” Kienzle said. \"Pen Argyl was a better team today. They played a better game and they deserved to win.\" \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @TomHinkelLV .
