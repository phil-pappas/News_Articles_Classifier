Youngstown State (3-4, 1-3 Missouri Valley) went for it on fourth on the subsequent series, but Jody Webb's halfback option pass fell incomplete out of the side of the end zone. \nA partial punt block late in the fourth by Chase Allen led to Southern Illinois' Austin Johnson kicking a game-tying 18-yard field goal to force overtime with 6 seconds left. \nEarlier in the fourth, Iannotti hooked up with Daquan Isom for a 75-yard catch-and-run touchdown to pull within 5, and the 2-point conversion made it a 3-point game. The Penguins went three-and-out, leading to the partial block. \nSouthern Illinois moved to 3-4, 2-2. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:19:47.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
