Â» The Tennessee Titans had no chance to blow a lead for a third game in a row. This time, they struggled to protect Marcus Mariota, and the rookie quarterback was limping before being pulled for the final drive for his own protection.\nMariota was sacked five times by halftime and turned the ball over four times Sunday in the Titans' 38-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins. The Heisman Trophy winner showed his toughness, not missing a play despite a low shot that left him needing a brace to finish the game.\nBut it was Mariota's worst game yet; he was 21 of 33 for 219 yards with a passer rating of 67.6.\n\"He's a battler,\" Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said. \"I love the kid. He's going to be a really good quarterback in the league. It starts with us being able to protect him better.\"\nMariota has been sacked 19 times through five games. The Titans (1-4) have dropped four in a row, and their home skid is up to eight dating to last season.\nFans booed heavily before heading to the exits, and Whisenhunt is 3-18 since taking over last season.\n\"There's no defense for today,\" Whisenhunt said.\nThen the coach started doing just that. He noted the Titans are playing a rookie quarterback and a rookie right tackle. Whisenhunt pulled Jeremiah Poutasi and replaced him with veteran Jamon Meredith in the first half. When center Brian Schwenke dislocated his left ankle, his replacement was another rookie in Andy Gallik.\nTennessee spent the past couple weeks talking about how close this team is after blowing double-digit leads against Indianapolis, then Buffalo a week ago. Miami scored first and never trailed. Tight end Delanie Walker said the blame is shared across the Titans and no one is pointing fingers.\n\"There's no excuses,\" Walker said. \"Basically, they beat us. They came to play, and they did that.\"\nMiami (2-3) snapped a three-game skid of its own. The Dolphins had been one of two teams in the NFL without a rushing touchdown, a drought Jarvis Landry ended on the opening drive. Lamar Miller ran for 113 yards and a TD.\nMiami also came in with only one sack, but Cameron Wake got his first four sacks this season and forced two fumbles by halftime.\nWith interim coach Dan Campbell making his debut, the Dolphins started the scoring with the Statue of Liberty. Campbell also won a replay review that changed a Mariota incompletion into a fumble, and Reshad Jones had a splashy celebration when he finished off a 30-yard interception return with a twisting leap into the end zone.\nThe Dolphins outgained Tennessee 434-299 while pounding Mariota.\nDolphins defensive end Olivier Vernon was flagged twice for roughing the passer, the first coming when he hit the rookie low in the left leg. Mariota didn't miss a snap, but he did put on a brace over his left knee between series. Whisenhunt criticized the hit.\n\"That should be taken out of the game,\" Whisenhunt said. \"That's not the way you play football. I think it was done with the idea of trying to hurt our quarterback.\"\nVernon defended himself, saying he knows it wasn't intentional.\n\"I've never been a dirty player in my whole career,\" Vernon said. \"Why would I start now?\"\nMariota said he hadn't looked at the play himself and that Vernon apologized to him after the game. Mariota also didn't think the brace limited his mobility.\n\"For the most part, I didn't even think about it,\" Mariota said.\nNOTES : Titans CB Perrish Cox tried to play with his injured hamstring but didn't last long. Titans LB Avery Williamson was deactivated with his injured hamstring. Back judge Greg Wilson, originally assigned to Patriots-Colts on Sunday night, worked this game. Wilson did not call Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright for batting the ball out of the end zone, and Seattle held on for a 13-10 victory over Detroit on Oct. 5.\nDownload ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:47:17.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
