How could I raise a kid with food issues? I love funnel cake.'\"\nLipshultz blogs about Becca's illness, hoping to raise awareness that eating disorders are serious, life-threatening illnesses and should be treated — and talked about — as such.\nShe knows some people look askance at her willingness to publicly share her daughter's battle, but she's resolute in her mission.\n\"If Becca had cancer or diabetes or pick-your-illness, we'd have no shame about it,\" Lipshultz said. \"We'd say, 'Becca has cancer, and we need your support.' Why should I hide this? We need the full support of our community, family and friends, and we want to support other families going through the same thing.\"\nBecca knows about the blog, Lipshultz says, but doesn't actively read it.\n\"She knows we are open about it, and I feel like not being open about it would make her feel like there's something wrong with her that we're embarrassed to share,\" Lipshultz says. \"I've been very open with my own experiences with mental illness; I had a horrible anxiety disorder when my dad was dying a few years ago. The big thing for me, personally, is raising awareness that this is a serious illness.\"\nTuesday's march will advocate for passage of the Anna Westin Act of 2015 , legislation to clarify the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which put mental health treatment on par with other medical treatment. Eating disorders weren't specifically mentioned in the law, however, which is what the Anna Westin Act aims to remedy. ( Anna Westin was a young woman from Minnesota who lost her life to anorexia in 2000.)\nEating disorders are classified as \"real, treatable medical illnesses,\" by the National Institutes of Health , and often co-exist with depression and anxiety disorders. Anorexia, according to the NIH, is associated with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Up to 30 million people of all ages and genders suffer from an eating disorder in the United States, according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders.\nAdvocates of the Anna Westin Act hope including eating disorders in the Mental Health Parity Act will lead to more research on preventing and treating them, more focused attention from health care professionals and more inclusive coverage from insurance companies.\n\"We need to stop the stigma and the shame and literally stand in the sunlight and show our faces,\" says Becky Henry, social media chair for Tuesday's march. \"Nothing's going to change until we have a bunch of angry moms on the Hill.\"\nHenry's daughter has battled eating disorders since age 14. She's 30 now, and Henry says she suffered through \"horrible treatment failure\" — doctors who didn't understand the signs of bulimia and didn't treat it as a mental illness.\n\"Eating disorders are the most deadly of all mental illness, and a lot of our health care professionals aren't even learning about them,\" Henry said.\nWhich leaves parents in the dark, says Lipshultz.\n\"I honestly didn't understand the mental health component and what had taken over our daughter's brain until the point when she went into the hospital,\" she said. \"I remember thinking, 'She's been lying to us about what she's eating,' and I got furious with her. If I could take it back, I would. Even being furious with her was like another voice in her head, saying, 'See? Your parents don't love you anyway because you're fat.'\"\nBecca was diagnosed in March and was admitted to the hospital in June for a dangerously low heart rate. Lipshultz says she is at a healthy weight now but the family assumes there is a long — possibly lifelong — battle ahead.\n\"I think of how I viewed this disease when Becca was diagnosed and how I view it now,\" Lipshultz recently wrote on her blog. \"I am definitely acutely aware that the road to recovery is much longer than I imagined — filled with some easy and some very challenging steps. It is not a straight path but one that goes back and forth and up and down — and in our case — it is not lined with gold, but instead paved with bumps of bagels, tortillas, pasta, pizza and meals out. But each time we pass a new mark and milestone I can look back a bit knowing we are making progress and hoping that by taking the harder path we can truly accomplish our end goal — a happy, healthy Becca.\"\nI hope for that too — for Becca and the millions of others quietly suffering through eating disorders.\nhstevens@tribpub.com\nTwitter @heidistevens13\n Mental Health Washington, D.C.
