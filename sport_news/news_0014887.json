Instead, she walked into an odyssey that has made her a symbol for frustrated airline passengers everywhere.\nTiana Fough As Stuart Tomlinson of The Oregonian/OregonLive.com reported , Fough was kicked off the plane and forced to take a later flight after a dispute with a flight attendant. Details of that dispute are sketchy, but many of the passengers who witnessed Fough's ejection felt she was treated unfairly. Fough was not the first passenger to suffer such indignity, nor is she likely to be the last. An increasing number of passengers have been booted from flights for \"things ... most individuals would consider trivial or even ordinary,\" said Douglas Kidd, executive director of the National Association of Airline Passengers .\nHere's an important point for travelers to remember before arguing their case in such a dispute: It doesn't matter who was right. Airline employees can kick passengers off flights for just about any reason. That, of course, doesn't mean that they should. So why do airlines treat passengers so poorly, and is there anything customers can do about it? A quick review of recent airline history is helpful in answering those questions.\nUntil the late 1970s, flying was regulated, expensive and something limited mostly to the wealthiest 20 percent of society. Once the airlines were freed from government control, prices plummeted as the airlines competed with each other for customers. In fact, they fought so hard for business that they just about killed each other. Today, the airlines with comprehensive national route networks all have bankruptcy in their recent history. In fact, most of them are composed of multiple formerly bankrupt carriers.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

Dysfunctional families tend to produce dysfunctional behavior. And that, in part, is what produced the not-so-friendly skies of today. To avoid yet another trip to bankruptcy court, the airlines have become energetic in both generating revenue (charging extra for everything from food and luggage to better seats) and reducing costs (driving hard bargains with both suppliers and employees).\nSo while many airline passengers feel they have been mistreated, many employees feel the same way. Flight attendants, in particular, frequently find their profession ranked high on \"worst jobs\" lists. That sets up a volatile environment. \"People having a bad day are drawn to each other like a magnet,\" Kidd said. And on any given day it's pretty easy to find both flight attendants and passengers who are having bad days.\nSo what can airline passengers do? Once you're at the boarding gate, your options are limited. So if you want to have as pleasant a flight as possible, you need to become an informed consumer. There's a lot of information about airlines available to customers who want to use it. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics issues reports on on-time performance . A variety of websites allow travelers to search for the lowest fares, though landing the best deal is a challenge because the airlines use their own computer programs to constantly manipulate prices based on demand.\nPrivate companies provide a raft of additional information, which is widely reported by news organizations. One worthwhile benchmark is the American Customer Satisfaction Index , based on a survey of travel-related companies' customers. J.D. Power also does an airline customer service study. Airlines' customer satisfaction rankings actually are at a 20-year high , but that's due in part to a handful of companies. And the three airlines with the best marks in recent ACSI rankings – Jet Blue, Alaska and Southwest – have more limited flight options than the traditional national carriers.\nThe good news for Portland travelers is that the highest-rated airlines have a larger share of the market in Portland than nationally. In fact, Alaska and Southwest are the top two airlines, based on annual passenger loads, at Portland International Airport. Horizon, Alaska's sister carrier, and Delta, which receives the highest customer ratings of the traditional national carriers, are third and fourth.\nEach airline has strengths and weaknesses in its route system. For reasons of convenience and price, most travelers will take a chance on a carrier with low customer-service ratings from time to time. When you do, remember that the odds of winning an argument with the airline are even worse than the odds at a Las Vegas slot machine.\n--The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/2015/04/20/airlines-hotels-best-worst/", "http://www.theacsi.org/the-american-customer-satisfaction-index", "http://cdn.portofportland.com/pdfs/June2015webstats.pdf", "http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mkl45efdgf/7-flight-attendant/", "http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/press_releases/dot094_15", "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/how-airline-ticket-prices-fell-50-in-30-years-and-why-nobody-noticed/273506/", "http://nationalassociationofairlinepassengers.org/", "http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2015-north-america-airline-satisfaction-study", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/20/pf/airline-customer-satisfaction-report/"], "published": "2015-10-24T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:13:49.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
