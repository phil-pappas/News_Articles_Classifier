Goodson earned Linebacker of the Week honors. \nNorth Carolina joined Clemson with two weekly honorees after rallying for a 38-31 ACC win at Georgia Tech. Marquise Williams was named the Offensive Back of the Week and Caleb Peterson the Offensive Lineman of the Week. \nOther week five honorees included Wake Forest's Cam Serigne as Receiver of the Week, Pitt's Terrish Webb and Florida State's Trey Marshall as Co-Defensive Backs of the Week, Duke's Ross Martin as Specialist of the Week and Louisville's Lamar Jackson as Rookie of the Week. \nACC Football Players of the Week are selected by a 14-member media panel. \nOFFENSIVE BACK – Marquise Williams, North Carolina, Sr., QB, 6-2, 225, Charlotte, N.C. \nWilliams rushed for a career-high 148 yards and scored three touchdowns to lead North Carolina to a record-setting 38-31 come-from-behind victory over Georgia Tech. The win was UNC's first in Atlanta against Georgia Tech since 1997 and marked the biggest comeback in school history (from a 21-0 first-half deficit). Williams led the Tar Heels in rushing yards (148), passing yards (134) and receiving yards (37). He scored on a 7-yard run in the second quarter with four seconds remaining to bring the Tar Heels within 21-14 at the half, and then scored what proved to be the winning touchdown with a 27-yard run in the fourth quarter on fourth down. Williams also caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver Quinshad Davis early in the fourth quarter to give the Tar Heels their first lead of the game. \nOFFENSIVE LINEMAN – Caleb Peterson, North Carolina, Sr., LG, 6-5, 300, Auburn, Ala. \nPeterson posted a career-best 13 knockdown blocks, did not allow a sack and graded out at 89 percent to help lead the Tar Heels to Saturday's win over Georgia Tech. Peterson helped pave the way for the Tar Heels to rush for 231 yards on 31 attempts, an average of 7.5 yards per rush. Carolina scored four rushing touchdowns as quarterback Marquise Williams had 148 yards rushing (9.9 yards per carry) and two rushing scores and tailback Elijah Hood had 60 yards rushing (5.0 yards per carry) and two touchdowns. \nRECEIVER – Cam Serigne, Wake Forest, So.-r, TE, 6-3, 245, Ashburn, Pa. \nSerigne hauled in 10 passes for 83 yards and a touchdown in the Demon Deacons' 24-16 ACC loss to visiting 11th-ranked Florida State on Saturday. Serigne caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Kendall Hinton late in the second quarter to bring Wake Forest within 14-10 at the half, and remained a consistent target as the Deacons battled the Seminoles to the finish. Serigne currently ranks sixth in the ACC in receptions per game (5.2) and is tied for eighth in receiving yardage (300 yards through five games). \nDEFENSIVE LINEMAN – Kevin Dodd, Clemson, Jr.-r, DE, 6-5, 275, Taylors, S.C. \nDodd had 3.5 tackles for losses of 17 yards, including a pair of sacks and a caused fumble in Clemson's 24-22 win over Notre Dame. Dodd had six total tackles and was involved in the key play of the game when he combined with teammate Carlos Watkins to stop Notre Dame quarterback DeShone Kiser on a two-point conversion attempt with just seven seconds remaining in the game. Dodd played 60 snaps in the game and also had a pair of quarterback pressures. \nLINEBACKER – B.J. Goodson, Clemson, Sr.-r, LB, 6-0, 240, Lamar, S.C. \nGoodson had five tackles, an interception and a fumble recovery in Clemson's win over Notre Dame. Both of his takeaways came in the fourth period with Notre Dame in the midst of a strong comeback bid. Goodson first had an interception, and then recovered a fumble on the Clemson 3-yard line to stop another drive. Goodson became the first Clemson defensive player to have two takeaways in the fourth period of a game the Tigers won by seven points or less since 1979, when Terry Kinard had a pair of fourth quarter interceptions in Clemson's 16-10 win at Notre Dame. \nCO-DEFENSIVE BACK – Trey Marshall, Florida State, So., DB, 6-0, 207, Lake City, Fla. \nMarshall led the Seminoles with 11 tackles and added a pass breakup in Saturday's 24-16 win at Wake Forest. The versatile Marshall played \"star\" and safety and helped hold the ACC's No. 1-ranked passing offense (300 yards per game entering the contest) to 215 passing yards. His 11 tackles were a career high. \nCO-DEFENSIVE BACK – Terrish Webb, Pitt, Jr., S, 5-11, 190, Clairton, Pa. \nWebb collected four tackles defended two passes and had an interception in helping Pitt limit Virginia Tech to 100 yards total offense and 91 yards passing in Saturday's 17-13 ACC road win. Webb's pick came with just under seven minutes to go in the game and helped the Panthers protect their four-point lead. It marked the third consecutive game that Webb had a hand in a turnover. He had interceptions in back-to-back games (versus Virginia Tech and Iowa) and forced a fumble at Akron on Sept. 12. \nSPECIALIST – Ross Martin, Duke, Sr., PK, 5-10, 185, Solon, Ohio \nMartin accounted for all of Duke's scoring in Saturday's 9-7 ACC win over Boston College with three field goals covering 36, 38 and 53 yards. The 53-yarder equaled his career long while matching the seventh-longest made field goal in Duke history. It is the longest in the ACC this season and is tied for the fifth longest nationally. Martin moved into sole possession of second place on Duke's all-time chart for career field goals of 50-plus yards (five). Martin's effort on Saturday propelled Duke to its first win without the benefit of a touchdown since 1978. \nROOKIE – Lamar Jackson, Louisville, Fr., QB, 6-3, 196, Boynton Beach, Fla. \nJackson picked up his second ACC Rookie of the Week honor of the season after leading the Cardinals to a 20-13 win at NC State. Jackson recorded his third 100-yard rushing game with 121 yards on 19 carries, including a 68-yard touchdown run – his second this season of over 65 yards. Jackson also also threw for 103 yards and a touchdown. After five games, Jackson already holds the Louisville school record for rushing yards in a season by a quarterback with 435 on 66 attempts (6.6 yards per carry). 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wfmy.com/1Lea5lk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:18:33.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
