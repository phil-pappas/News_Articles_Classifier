The pick-six, late in the second quarter, gave USC a 28-14 lead. In a departure from recent performances, the Trojans built on it in the second half, getting touchdowns from Cody Kessler (1-yard sneak) and JuJu Smith-Schuster (25-yard pass from Kessler).\nSmith-Schuster finished with eight catches for 143 yards. Kessler was 21 of 28 for 264 yards. Tailbacks Ronald Jones II and Justin Davis combined for 139 rushing yards.\nBy getting a lead and adding to it, USC (4-3 overall, 2-2 Pac-12) forced Utah (6-1, 3-1) out of its comfort zone. Star tailback Devontae Booker had just 62 yards on 14 carries (he did add 49 yards on six catches). Quarterback Travis Wilson threw four interceptions – surpassing by one the former San Clemente High standout’s total for the season. The Utes had just 99 rushing yards and 353 total yards.\nUSC won despite losing two more starters to injury – center Toa Lobendahn (knee) and tight end Taylor McNamara (shoulder).\nUSC visits No. 20 Cal next Saturday.\nContact the writer: mlev@ocregister.com\nRelated: USC-Utah box score", "external_links": ["http://sports.ocregister.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510240062&home=62&vis=94"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:25:15.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
