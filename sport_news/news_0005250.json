Five states -Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Mexico and North Carolina - have policies that TransAthlete views as discriminatory, with four of them using a birth certificate to determine gender.\nMosier added that there is no research to support the idea that allowing a transgender girl to compete would create a competitive imbalance.\nOne of the members of the Legislative Council to speak out during Monday's meeting, Barbers Hill ISD's Greg Poole, said that his sole interest in the rule was \"fair and equitable competition,\" not to \"cast stones at anyone's personal choice.\"\nIn previous meetings with UIL staff, Poole had lobbied that the league should be even more restrictive, requiring the student-athlete's original birth certificate, before being advised otherwise by the UIL's legal counsel.\nThe league has a \"non-discrimination\" policy in its constitution, stating that no student shall be denied an equal opportunity to compete in sports because of disability, race, color, gender, religion or national origin - with certain caveats. But the league hadn't taken steps to officially define gender until Monday.\nThe new rule adds a subsection which states that: \"Gender shall be determined based on a student's birth certificate. In cases where a student's birth certificate is unavailable, other similar government documents used for the purpose of identification may be substituted.\"\nThe change was one of over 60 revisions put in front of the council for approval on Monday; the UIL is rewriting its entire constitution, one of the directives requested from the Sunset Review process the league finished earlier this year.\nTwitter: @corbettsmithDMN\nOn Thursday and Friday night, the only way to keep up with your team and games across the area is beta.SportsDayHS.com .
