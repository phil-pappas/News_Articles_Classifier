Did you see or hear this imbecile today? For someone who only exists to say stupid things to be noticed for something so stupid it is shocking, it must be remarkable.\"You don't want me as your enemy\"? Kevin Durant is so far out of your league he wouldn't bother to wipe his ass with you. This backass jerkwater lies openly about Durant, gets called on it, and has the self important sniveling douchiness to get on the air and threaten a superstar. These media types can't wait to be part of a story themselves, even if they have to make one up and cast themselves as the \"D\" movie bad guy. I hope he gets fired and it can't come soon enough. ESPN has enough value that it doesn't have to pander to stupidity for ratings. Everyone everywhere hates this guy. For those who haven't eaten yet: Age: 35 Posts: 4,884 Just for the record; I am ALWAYS down to talk about what an indescribable douche Steven A Smith is. It's nice to know we can share this close bond. lol What a total buffoon. Sorry, I take Kevin Durant's word over Stephen any day of the week. All this dude does is pander to the players he loves and rips on the players he doesn't. He thinks he is this brave \"voice of the black man\" when most black people think he's a joke too. His only defense is; Durant is lying, I've interviewed him before in his rookie year so see we did talk once! What a moron. You know how I would describe someone who I had a conversation with years ago and haven't spoken to since? Yeah; Someone I don't talk to. Smith wouldn't even say, no he's lying, Kevin Durant told me this, cuz that's not true he's a lying little coward wanna be 'street cred' who believes that the best defense is a big scary offense like he's a freaking gangsta or something. I'm sure Kevin Durant lost a lot of sleep over his threat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:33:02.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
