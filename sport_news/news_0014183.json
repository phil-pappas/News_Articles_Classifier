Steven Fletcher seems to be scoring quite regularly, we all know Jermain Defoe can score and we have got Fabio Borini, so we can score hopefully a few goals from set plays, so if we can keep that going, then sort the defensive side out, then we should be okay. \n\"Then January brings another challenge. What player can we get, were can we get him from and more importantly, is he good enough? That's going to be a task that we need to start planning for now, we need to start finding out about now. \n\"But in the meantime, that wouldn't be my first priority, my first priority is to try to get this time winning.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:05:42.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
