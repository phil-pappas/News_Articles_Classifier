That sent the players streaming out of the dugout and prompted a wild celebration among the long-suffering Cubs fans. \n\"They deserve it,\" Rizzo said in the middle of the party. \"Hopefully, this is just a taste of what's to come.\" \nThe Cubs are headed to the NL Championship Series for the first time since 2003, when they lost in seven games to the Florida Marlins. On that occasion, Chicago lost the final two at home, including the infamous defeat in Game 6 when a fan grabbed at a fly-ball which a Cubs outfielder was about to catch, denying Chicago a vital out. \nChicago will face the winner of the Los Angeles Dodgers-New York Mets matchup. \nThat series is locked 2-2 after the Dodgers won 3-1 at Citi Field on Tuesday, sending the series back to Los Angeles for a decisive Game 5 on Thursday. \nRizzo's solo drive to right off losing pitcher Kevin Siegrist in the sixth put Chicago back on top 5-4 after St. Louis had scored two in the top half of the inning. \nSchwarber's monstrous shot leading off the seventh gave the Cubs a two-run lead and ended the scoring. The ball landed on top of the right-field videoboard. \nThe late drives by Rizzo and Schwarber along with Baez's three-run homer off John Lackey in the second came after Chicago set a postseason record with six homers in Monday's win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:15:26.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
