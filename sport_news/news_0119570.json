Defensively, I was really upset at the kids. We had a bad week of practice. The kids are young and inexperienced and their first year in this program and the attention to detail, trusting the coach.” \n“We played pretty well offensively,\" Owls coach Josh Shattuck said. \"We really made some adjustments that got things fixed quickly on the defensive side of the ball. [New Albany is] just a nightmare to defend with a couple kids they’ve got. They just feel like the can score a touchdown on any play.” \nThe Bulldogs scored on their first two possessions as they marched 71 yards in eight plays for their first score, a 2-yard run by Darquan Richardson. The Bulldogs picked up first downs on four straight running plays when Richards, Rondale Moore and Justin Ricketts took turns running the ball. \nRicketts raced 60 yards for a score on the Bulldogs’ second possession, and the senior quarterback ran 22 yards at 7:16 of the second period to put the Bulldogs on top 18-6. \nIn between the first two scores, the Owls lit up their side of the scoreboard when Alan Perry ran 49 yards for a score. \nFollowing New Albany’s third TD, Evens Cribs returned the kickoff 32 yards to the NA 38 and Perry passed three yards to Evan Frische for a score with 6:11 on the clock. \nFrische then recovered a fumble on New Albany’s next possession and the Owls turned that into a 6-yard TD run by Zach Carpenter. \nAfter the Owls recovered an onside kick, Perry passed 5 yards to Chris Knight for a TD with 13.6 seconds left in the half. \nPerry scored on a pair of 1-yard runs in the second half, while Richardson scored on a 57-yard run with 8:43 remaining in the fourth period that cut the Owls’ lead to 34-26. \nMoore topped the Bulldogs (2-4 HHC, 3-5) in rushing with 144 yards in 11 carries, Richardson gained 90 yards on seven carries. Ricketts had 80 yards on 13 carries for New Albany, which hosts rival Floyd Central in next week's regular-season finale. \nSEYMOUR 42, NEW ALBANY 26 \nNew Albany 12 6 0 8—26 \nSeymour 6 20 8 8—42 \nSCORING PLAYS \nN — Darquan Richardson 2 run (kick failed), 8:56. \nS — Alan Perry 49 run (pass failed), 7:16. \nN — Justin Ricketts 60 run (pass failed), 7:04. \nSecond quarter \nN — Rondale Moore 22 pass from Ricketts (run failed), 7:16. \nS — Evan Frische 3 pass from Perry ((Luke Dover pass form Perry), 6:11. \nS — Zach Carpenter 1 6 run (pass failed), 4:20. \nS — Chris Knight 5 pass from Perry (pass failed), 13.6. \nThird quarter \nS — Perry 1 run (Knight pass from Perry), 3:54. \nFourth quarter \nN — Richardson 57 run (Moore run), 8:43. \nS — Perry 1 run (Dover pass from Perry), 2:24. \nGAME STATISTICS \nSeymour: Zach Carpenter 20-97, Perry 15-114, Luke Dover 4-2, Morris 4-30. \nNew Albany: Ricketts 13-80, Moore 11-144, Richardson 7-90. \nPASSING", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:10:25.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
