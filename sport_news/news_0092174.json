The police said the gunfight erupted in Bangam Kunzer village, nearly 30 km from here, when troops of the Rashtriya Rifles battalion and the Special Operations Group of the J&K Police launched a search operation after receiving information about the presence of two militants in the area. “Around 7 am when searches were being carried out, the militants hiding in the area tried to break the cordon and opened indiscriminate fire on the forces triggering a gunfight. In the gunfight, one militant was killed and three soldiers were injured,” a source said. The injured jawans were evacuated to the Army’s Srinagar-based 92 Base Hospital for treatment. The condition of one of the injured is stated to be critical. An Army spokesman said the soldiers sustained injuries while ensuring no damage was caused to the locals of the area. The slain Hizb militant has been identified as Nisar Ahmad Wani, a resident of Adipora Kunzer. Wani had joined the group earlier this year and was a close associate of slain Hizb commander Fayaz Ahmad Bhat, whose bullet-riddled body was recovered near Tangmarg town last month. After Fayaz’s death, Wani was looking after the outfit in the area and was working in close coordination with south Kashmir-based militant commander Zakir, the police said. The exchange of fire between the two sides continued for almost an hour. Later, searches were carried out in the area but no fresh contact with the militants was established. The encounter took place close to the national highway that connects Srinagar with the tourist resort of Gulmarg. Wani had a narrow escape immediately after he joined militancy. On April 2, Wani along with Fayaz had managed to escape a cordon at Hardespora in Pattan in which an Army jawan and a special police officer (SPO) of the J&K Police were killed. Wani, the police said, was instrumental in luring local boys to join militancy. “He was also involved in intimidating local panches and sarpanches,” a police officer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:10:29.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
