The Knights defeated visiting Dayton 25-16, 25-18, 25-14 to extend their league record to 8-1. Tri-Cities Prep of Pasco is also 8-1 in league play following its 25-12, 25-13, 25-16 victory at Prescott Thursday. Dayton saw its league record slip to 7-3, and the Bulldogs are 10-4 overall. “The team played a great match tonight,” Dayton coach Scott Schafer said. “We have reached that part of the season where everything works well together as team members fulfill their roles. It’s great to see. “The first time we played Dayton, there were still rotations we were trying to figure out, which made for a different match. This time they stepped up and played a much better game.” Gabrielle Browning led WWVA at the net with 12 kills and Alissa Hendrickson followed with nine kills. Browning also shared the team’s digs lead with Sydnee Sutton, each with seven, and she produced three blocks. Hendrickson was the Knights’ blocks leader with four. Krista Schafer put up 35 assists to lead the Knights in that department. Schafer was also 14-for-14 serving with a pair of aces. WWVA travels to DeSales Monday for another league match. Dayton was led by Josilyn Fullerton’s all-around match. She scored six kills, put up seven assists, registered eight digs and had four blocks in the losing effort. Mia Becker led the Bulldogs with 12 digs and Hanna Becker added 10 digs. Jenna Phillips finished with eight digs, six kills and three blocks. “WWVA played great,” Dayton coach Shannon Turner said. “They passed the ball well and ran their offense with very few unforced errors. “We struggled with every game to get our passes where we needed them to be,” she added. “We didn’t run our offense well or consistently. We played scrappy and fought to stay alive, but you can’t stay alive if you don’t hit the ball.” The Bulldogs host Tri-Cities Prep Monday and finish up the regular season at Waitsburg on Thursday. Touchet falls to Colton COLTON, Wash. — Touchet suffered a 25-18, 25-15, 25-16 Southeast 1B League volleyball defeat here Thursday at the hands of the Colton Wildcats. The loss left the Indians with a 5-7 record in league matches and 6-7 overall. “We got in our heads a bit tonight,” Touchet coach April Miller said. “These girls can do amazing things when they put their minds to it. “Our biggest battle tonight was against ourselves. We can overcome this.” Rachel Miller led the Indians with eight kills, Cierra Jo McKeown contributed a team-high eight assists and Jennifer Aceves led the way with 10 digs. McKeown also totaled seven assists and a team-leading seven serving aces. Katie Skramstad put up seven assists and Abby Grudzinski chipped in with two stuffs. Touchet entertains Liberty Christian Monday night, which will be senior night for the Indians. Cardinals turn tables on Irish WAITSBURG — Coach Angie Potts watched her Waitsburg volleyball team turn up the heat and turn the tables on visiting DeSales here Thursday night. After suffering a five-set defeat in Walla Walla earlier in the year, the Cardinals turned away DeSales 25-20, 25-22, 25-22 to pull within one game of the Irish in the Southeast 2B League standings. DeSales is now 5-5 in league play and alone in fourth place. Waitsburg is 4-6 heading into the final week of the regular season. Waitsburg, which is 9-13 overall, visits Prescott Tuesday and hosts third-place Dayton Thursday. DeSales, now 9-10 for the year, faces a more difficult final week as it hosts SE2B co-leaders Walla Walla Valley Academy Monday and Tri-Cities Prep Wednesday. “This was the best, most well-rounded match we have played this season,” Potts said of her team’s Thursday effort. “I was really proud of them. They did everything well. “We absolutely knew we were well matched against DeSales,” Potts added. “It was nice to come back from losing to them in five sets and win this one in three.” Devon Harshman posted seven kills to lead the Cardinals at the net. Harshman also contributed two blocks. Bailey Adams and Caitlyn Jones shared the team’s digs lead with nine each, and Adams also registered six kills. Kaitlin Mohney had six digs in the match. Ariel Sandau had a team-best 12 assists and chipped in with three kills. Taylor Jones contributed four serving aces. DeSales, playing shorthanded because of injuries, was led by outside hitter Maddy Thomas, who registered five kills and 12 digs. Middle hitter Alicia Halder also finished the night with five kills and senior libero Teresa Acock totaled a career-high 53 digs. “It was a battle all night,” Irish coach Ann Murray said. “Our offense is what fell through,” she added. “Because of injuries we have had to change our rotation, and we’ve had to learn a handful of rotations in the past week due to injuries and missing players. This is definitely a setback when coaching a small team.” The top three teams qualify for the postseason. Walla Walla Valley Academy has already determined that it will not participate in the playoffs because of religious obligations and Tri-Cities Prep and Dayton have clinched postseason berths. Thus, Waitsburg and DeSales are contending for the final slot. Jaguars too much for Tigers PRESCOTT — Tri-Cities Prep proved to be too much for Prescott here Thursday, as the Jaguars defeated the Tigers 25-12, 25-13, 25-16 in a Southeast 2B League volleyball match. T-C Prep improved to 8-1 in league play and continues to share first place in the league standings with Walla Walla Valley Academy. The Knights prevailed at home in three sets against third-place Dayton Thursday. Prescott saw its league record slide to 0-10. The Tigers are 2-10 overall. “We doubled the amount of points we scored against the Jaguars the last time we played them,” Prescott coach Bob Young said. “We also increased with each set. That’s outstanding for us. “We look forward to carrying that effort into next week against Waitsburg and Asotin.” Prescott entertains Waitsburg Tuesday and travels to Asotin Wednesday for league matches. “Tuesday is senior night,” Young noted. “We will honor Athziry Amezcua, Ruby Rosales and Perla Xolio.” As for Thursday’s match, Young singled out the defensive play of Amezcua, Xolio, Maribel Mendoza, Joscelyn Granados, Yoali Ortega and Michelle Cardenas. They each finished with at least three digs, Young said. Pirates down L-W, clinch SE1B title POMEROY — Ireland Mayfield led the way here Thursday night as Pomeroy clinched the Southeast 1B League volleyball championship outright. After claiming a share of the title Tuesday with a straight-set victory at Lacrosse-Washtucna, the defending Washington Class 1B state champs have the league title to themselves after a 25-9, 25-21, 17-25, 25-18 victory over Oakesdale. The Pirates improved to 13-0 in league matches and 20-13 overall. They close out the regular season Tuesday when they host Colton in a league counter. “It was a good, solid match against a very gifted team,” Pomeroy coach Jim Greene said. “We dominated in the first set, but the next three sets were almost dead even.” Oakesdale was the team Greene believed would challenge the Pirates for the league championship when the season began. The Nighthawks are now battling Colton for second place. “They had everyone back from last season,” Greene said of the Nighthawks. “They were loaded. I didn’t know if we would finish 1-2 or 2-1. “Now I know they are hoping we can beat Colton on Tuesday because Oakesdale and Colton are tied with three losses.” Mayfield finished the night with a team-high 25 assists and added seven kills and five serving aces. Ally Bott led the Pirates at the net with 17 kills and Kacey Halbert led with 17 digs. Sydney Smith was Pomeroy’s leader at the service line, going 20-for-20 with three aces. Esther Schuh chipped in with 10 kills.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:36:56.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
