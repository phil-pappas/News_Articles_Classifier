In the span of more than 30 years since the first 400 were announced, one of the most noticeable trends has been in sports. Namely, it's been the prevalence of one league's owners. \nThe National Football League, with its soaring profit margins ( adding a billion in revenue last year alone ), is once again a fixture on the list. Of the many sports team owners who are mixed into the 400, 17 are NFL owners. That's a greater number than any other sport. The NBA, with 13, is the closest, though it's important to remember that some (like Paul Allen and Stan Kroenke) have ownership stakes in both an NFL and NBA team. \nPatriots owner Robert Kraft (net worth listed at $4.8 billion) saw an increase of $800 million thanks to the skyrocketing valuation of his team. The NFL cash machine is firing on all cylinders.

Names like Lamar Hunt (original founder of the AFL and Kansas City Chiefs owner), Eddie DeBartolo Jr. (former San Francsisco 49ers owner) and Georgia Frontiere (late owner of the Rams) appeared on the very first 400 list (also of note: the publication ran a fascinating top 100 list nearly a hundred years ago , expanding only more recently to 400). \nWhile other sports have certainly attracted wealthy owners (Ted Turner's ownership of the Braves, as an example), no other sport in the United States over the last 30 years has created so much wealth as the NFL. \nInstead of wealthy individuals buying sports teams as playthings (as happens most prominently in world soccer), the NFL has had a capacity to grow the wealth of an individual, exponentially. \nKraft's ownership of the Patriots exemplifies this trend better than almost anyone else. When he bought the Patriots, much of his own personal wealth was put on the line ( as the price was higher than any NFL team in history to that point ). Yet after a period of remarkable success, both on and off the field, the local businessman's gamble has been vindicated, as proven in most basic terms by his continually escalating Forbes ranking.
