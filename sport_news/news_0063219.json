But, new cameras and large-scale interviews may reveal the bullies, according to school administration. The latest development, a death threat note slipped into the student’s PE locker Tuesday, was immediately turned over to police by school administration. “It was a very serious, defiant threat,” said Superintendent Pat Chabot. “Not specific as to how, but it stated the killing would take place (Wednesday).” On advice from the school, the student did not attend classes Wednesday, and the school is trying to interview every student who entered the locker room Tuesday hoping one may have seen something, Chabot said. “So far we’ve interviewed dozens,” he said. The student’s parents were notified immediately, and a mass email informed staff Wednesday morning. Chabot said there was no need to notify other parents at the school because the note was directed toward one girl, and he believed no one else was in danger. The note is now in the hands of the Sonora Police Department, but both investigators and the school said they had no leads as of Friday. An ongoing investigation by the school and law enforcement was begun last November when the student was sent text messages and notes urging suicide. The written attacks turned physical in May when the same student was attacked in the locker room by a hooded assailant. In the wake of the attack, the school promised to update security cameras, which had never captured the attacker or those responsible for the notes. The cameras still have not been replaced. Chabot said Friday the district is well into the process of getting new cameras on campus, and expect to have the project go out to bid in a matter of weeks. In September, the district sent three administrators to a trade show hosted by Surveillance Systems Inc. at Thunder Valley Casino and Resort in Lincoln. Three vendors have since visited the campus to evaluate where and what type of new cameras can be installed. Estimates should be delivered next week, after which the district will put the project out to bid. “There’s a lot good software vendors that make the process of interacting with cameras much easier, which helps anyone find what they need to find. The old camera systems took a lot of training to be able use them effectively,” said Matt Leamy, technology systems specialist. The district is looking to purchase software that will allow the footage to be accessed remotely. “This all takes time, and we want to make sure it’s done professionally and that we have the best cameras we can afford,” Chabot said. Chabot said he did not want to reveal the budget until the project has been picked up by a contractor. The note Tuesday was found in the student’s PE locker, an area the school can never monitor with cameras. Though the bullying has persisted for months, it takes on added urgency in light of the arrests last week of four boys at Summerville High School who authorities said plotted to shoot students and teachers. “I think it shows that these kind of things can happen anywhere,” Chabot said. “We want to make sure if students are scared they can come to a counselor.” At Summerville, a group of students were the first to tell a teacher what they heard. Chabot added that the one positive of the Summerville incident is that is shows students feel they can trust adults and will speak up if they think something is happening.
