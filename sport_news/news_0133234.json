Now they say 25 is the age limit,\" said Banerjee.\n\"Now bridge is a sport where only when you gain maturity would you touch winning standards. So to achieve that before 25 is impossible. In short, even the little employment opportunity that was available will cease before long,\" added Roy on the sidelines of the ongoing 42nd World Bridge Championships here.\nOn whether bridge can take the route of chess, which gained popularity after Viswanathan Anand's success, the duo said \"only results mattered\".\n\"If we have world beaters among us in this sport then surely the chances are high,\" said one of them. \"But do we have? That is the big question. The current edition should throw some light.\"\nStressing on the lack of a proper system, Banerjee said: \"We do not have the necessary infrastructure and we play with so many limitations. Whatever preparations we do are our own effort.\n\"It is one thing to be considered national champions and we have been champion pair many times over but the demands are considerable in an international meet. The sport needs greater financial support from sponsors and government.\"\nThe two Eastern Railway officials hailing from Kolkata said it was too early to talk about India's chances of entering the knockout phase in the Bermuda Bowl event of the ongoing HCL-World bridge team championship here.\n\"We have so many more matches to go. It is too early to say anything,\" Banerjee and Roy, who are part of the Indian Railway team that qualified to represent the country in this Championship, said.\nIndia has only twice before qualified for the quarterfinal round (2000 Paris and 2005 Estoril, Portugal).
