Farrell completed chemotherapy in late September and had undergone scheduled post-treatment testing at Massachusetts General Hospital on Wednesday. Farrell was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's Burkitt lymphoma on Aug. 10 and took a leave of absence. Team president Dave Dombrowski announced just before the end of the season that Farrell would return as manager next season, health permitting. Bench coach and longtime Farrell friend Torey Lovullo took over as interim manager for the rest of the reason and will return as bench coach next season, giving up the chance to interview for managerial jobs to provide insurance should Farrell not be back to 100 percent by next spring. — Brian MacPherson CORSAIRS Tennis makes LEC final Kristen Rose, a senior from North Dartmouth, won the deciding match at fourth singles to help lead the fourth-seeded UMass Dartmouth women's tennis team to a 5-4 victory at top-seeded Rhode Island College in the semifinals of the Little East Conference Tournament on Thursday.
