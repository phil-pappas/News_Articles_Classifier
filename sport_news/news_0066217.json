On the third snap of the game, Johnson intercepted a pass by Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford.\nThe Lions lost six turnovers in a 42-17 loss to the Cardinals, and Johnson came up with three of them. He also intercepted Stafford's replacement, Dan Orlovsky, in the fourth quarter and came up with a fumble recovery in the second quarter. The fumble recovery gave Arizona the ball at the Detroit 22-yard line and set up a touchdown that gave the Cardinals a 28-7 lead.\nJohnson also had five tackles in the game.\nJohnson has three interceptions this season and 13 in the career. The former Sulligent High School star enjoyed the third two-interception game. He picked off two passes against the Atlanta Falcons in 2013 and had two interceptions against the Washington Redskins last year.\nJohnson was among the 25 former Alabama players who got on the field on the fifth Sunday of the NFL's 2015 season.\nOther former Alabama players who started on Sunday included wide receiver Julio Jones of the Atlanta Falcons, inside linebacker C.J. Mosley and outside linebacker Courtney Upshaw of the Baltimore Ravens, defensive tackle Marcell Dareus of the Buffalo Bills, cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick and right offensive tackle Andre Smith of the Cincinnati Bengals, middle linebacker Rolando McClain of the Dallas Cowboys, left guard Evan Mathis of the Denver Broncos, free safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and running back Eddie Lacy of Green Bay Packers, running back T.J. Yeldon of the Jacksonville Jaguars, linebacker Dont'a Hightower and tight end Michael Williams of the New England Patriots, free safety Landon Collins of the New York Giants, wide receiver Amari Cooper of the Oakland Raiders, inside linebacker DeMeco Ryans of the Philadelphia Eagles, defensive tackle Quinton Dial of the San Francisco 49ers and safety Mark Barron of the St. Louis Rams.\nJones caught five passes for 67 yards – all in the second half – in the Falcons' 25-19 overtime victory against the Washington Redskins. Jones scored a touchdown, but not on a reception. He recovered a fumble by Atlanta running back Devonta Freeman in the end zone to give the Falcons a 12-7 lead with 9:14 left in the fourth quarter.\nAtlanta became the first team in NFL history to win its first five games in a season after trailing in the fourth quarter of all of them. Jones, who was listed as questionable on the injury report because of hamstring and toe problems, caught consecutive passes good for 28 yards on a fourth-quarter TD march that gave the Falcons a 19-16 lead with 24 seconds left in the game.\nDareus made five tackles and had two quarterback hurries in the Bills' 14-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans. Dareus, who prepped at Huffman High School, brought seven buses of youngsters from Birmingham to the game in Nashville, Buffalo's closest game this season to his hometown.\nRELATED: MARCELL DAREUS BRINGING SEVEN BUSES FROM BIRMINGHAM FOR SUNDAY'S GAME\nMcClain missed the first four games of the season because of an NFL-imposed suspension , but he returned to lead the Cowboys with eight tackles, including a sack and two tackles for loss, in a 30-6 loss to the Patriots. Hightower got off to a fast start in the game for New England, with four tackles, including a sack. But he left the game with a rib injury in the first quarter and did not return. Williams made his first NFL start in the game.\nRolando McClain's sack from earlier #CowboysNation pic.twitter.com/kGB1jXTRl8\n— Cowboys 247 (@NFL_Cowboys247) October 11, 2015 Clinton-Dix had six tackles and his first interception of the season and Lacy ran for 27 yards on 13 carries and caught an 8-yard pass in Green Bay's 24-10 victory over the Rams. Barron, a safety by trade, started at outside linebacker for St. Louis because of injuries.\nClinton-Dix's interception came in the end zone, giving the ball back to the Packers with 9:03 left in the game and Green Bay leading 21-10. In the game's final minute, Clinton-Dix made a touchdown-saving tackle on wide receiver Stedman Bailey at the Green Bay 7-yard line after a 68-yard gain. Two plays later, the Packers came up with an interception to seal their victory.\nComing off his first 100-yard game, Yeldon scored his first NFL touchdown, catching a 4-yard pass with 2:57 left in the third quarter to give Jacksonville a four-point lead over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs came back for a 38-31 victory. Yeldon finished with 32 yards on 11 carries and five receptions for 31 yards. He suffered a groin injury and left the game for good after a rushing attempt on the last play of the third quarter.\nCooper caught four passes for 47 yards, ran once for 2 yards and returned a punt for 18 yards in the Raiders' 16-10 loss to the Broncos.\nOther former Alabama players seeing action on Sunday included Cardinals defensive tackle Ed Stinson, Bills offensive tackle Cyrus Kouandjio, Bengals defensive end Wallace Gilberry, Jaguars long snapper Carson Tinker, New Orleans Saints running back Mark Ingram and Tennessee Titans fullback Jalston Fowler.\nC.J. Spiller started at running back over Ingram for the Saints in their 39-17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, but Ingram ran for 57 yards on 12 carries and caught two passes for 17 yards.\nIn a statistical oddity, Ingram and Lacy were credited with tackles on Sunday after interceptions.\nFowler was last seen suffering a knee injury trying to run in an ill-fated 2-point conversion after his first NFL touchdown on Sept. 27. The Titans had a bye last week, and Fowler was back on the field on Sunday. On punt coverage, he caused a fumble to give Tennessee the ball at the Buffalo 39-yard line, which the Titans' offense turned into a TD for a 10-0 lead with 6:51 left in the third quarter. The Bills rallied for a 14-13 victory.\nBengals quarterback AJ McCarron did not play on Sunday.\nTitans guard Chance Warmack and Redskins guard Arie Kouandjio were designated as inactive. Warmack suffered a sprained knee ligament on Sept. 20 and missed his second straight game, although he was listed as questionable on the NFL injury report on Sunday.\nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE\nThe Carolina Panthers, Miami Dolphins, Minnesota Vikings and New York Jets were on their bye weeks.\nThe fifth week of the NFL season concludes with the Pittsburgh Steelers visiting the San Diego Chargers at 7:30 p.m. CDT Monday.
