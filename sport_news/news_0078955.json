He was told police were being called and that he needed to stay, at which point he said, “Tell the police I’m Commissioner Shabazz” and left again, police said.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/212788987_0_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/212788987_0_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:13:34.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
