Dominic Pileggi, R-9, Delaware County, introduced Senate Bill 411 , which amends the Right to Know Law by, among several changes, allowing an agency to deny requests from people involved in litigation, expanding access to university records and requiring agencies to develop policies to notify employees when their home addresses are part of Right to Know requests. \nHowever, state Sen. Michele Brooks, R-50, Mercer County, introduced an amendment that added state, municipal and school district employees, including teachers, to the list of workers, such as police and judges, whose home addresses are not accessible under the law. \nExempting public employees’ home addresses was opposed by the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association, which called it “overbroad and unnecessary.” While senators supporting the measure said they were doing so for safety reasons, the PNA said certain exemptions already existed, including one for people “at risk of a demonstrated harm.” \nKeeping home addresses accessible serves the public interest, the PNA said, by allowing the verification of residency for candidates and some employees. The media also uses it to confirm the identities of subjects they are writing about, which could include those charged with crimes or those being honored by their communities, the PNA said. \n“For obvious reasons, it is critical that these individuals are properly identified (and that others are not incorrectly identified),” the PNA said in a release to state media outlets. \nState Sen. Pat Stefano, R-32, Bullskin Township, did not vote for the Brooks amendment, saying there were numerous ways for home addresses to be obtained, and he did not see where it provided additional protection to workers. \n“There’s a million other ways (requesters) can find it,” Stefano said. \nHowever, state Sen. Camera Bartolotta, R-46, Carroll Township, Washington County, voted for the Brooks amendment, explaining it protects workers from people who are mentally unstable or have bad intentions. \n“You don’t want your private, exact street address to be out there for anyone to request,” said Bartolotta. “You don’t want to put someone’s family at risk like that unnecessarily.” \nBartolotta, who said she supports government transparency, disagreed with the PNA’s argument, saying she saw no benefit to having public employees’ addresses in the public realm. \nState Sen. Elder Vogel Jr., R-47, New Sewickley Township, said he voted against the Brooks amendment because “everything in it was pretty well covered already” and it seemed to simply duplicate Pileggi’s proposal. \nBrooks’ amendment narrowly passed 26-23, but Pileggi’s bill passed unanimously and now moves to the House for consideration. The three western Pennsylvania senators said they liked other parts of the bill such as limiting inmates’ ability to use Right to Know other than for requests related to their own cases. \nBartolotta said 40 percent of Right to Know requests come from inmates, some of whom are clearly intent on trying to dig up information on the prisons in which they are held. \n“That puts people in jeopardy,” she said. \nStefano said he also liked language restricting those who try to use the law to gather information for commercial purposes. \nPaula Knudsen, the director of government affairs and legislative counsel for the PNA, said that the group would continue fighting against the Brooks amendment language as the bill moves along in the state House. \n“We’re obviously going to advocate for the Brooks piece of it to be stripped out and to keep the Pileggi part of it,” she said.
