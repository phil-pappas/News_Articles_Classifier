This secret trade deal will affect all Canadians. It puts their jobs, their environment and their household budgets at risk.”\nAsked why it came now, Conservative spokesman Kory Teneycke said “because we’re nice guys, that’s why.”\nHarper acknowledged Thursday the final text would not be available before the election, but said “virtually all” sectors of Canadian industries that could be affected have been briefed and support the deal as good for the Canadian economy. The government has offered $4.3 billion over 15 years to ease dairy, poultry and egg farmers concerns, and $1 billion over 10 years to the auto industry to transition to more foreign competition.\nAll three national party leaders campaigned hard Thursday in Quebec where they each lay claim to best represent “Quebec values” but slung accusations at each other.\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau said Harper should be “embarrassed” to associate his campaign with Rob Ford, the self-admitted crack-smoking former Toronto mayor. Harper downplayed a rally announced by his brother Doug Ford, as an event organized not by the Fords but by the Conservative Party of Canada.\nBut many see it as a sign of desperation by a sagging Conservative campaign .\nAnd as Harper campaigned, his message to voters also lowered its initial expectations.\nUnlike Trudeau, Harper won’t say whether he wants Canadians to give him a majority government.\n“I and our party, we never take voters for granted. It’s not the way we do things. It’s a tight election,” he told reporters.\nIt was not out of modesty, but a tactical tweak which acknowledged a certain reality — though Harper would not articulate it.\nJust 10 weeks ago, in the early days of the campaign, Harper had no misgivings about calling for a majority, telling an audience in Belleville, Ont., the choice was clear. “It’s a choice we must get right and that choice has been and remains, a strong, stable national majority government.”\nHe says Trudeau and Mulcair are real threats, and pose grave risks to Canadian taxpayers’ financial stability. But Harper has adopted a tactically cautious approach to any talk of what Parliament would or should look like.\nIt sounds less arrogant — a lesson he learned to his chagrin in 2004 when voters rejected his calls for a majority. It wasn’t until 2006 voters handed him the first of two minorities, and only in 2011 did he win a majority of seats.\nNow after nearly 10 years in power, Harper refuses to answer questions about any post-Oct. 19 scenarios, including how would he work with other parties, and what coalitions could he form to implement an agenda.\nIt’s not at all clear to the public what Harper’s thinking is about his future, or with which party he believes that a minority Conservative government could seek support even on an issue-by-issue basis. The others — NDP, Liberals, Greens, and Bloc Québécois — have all said they would work to defeat his government.\nThe Conservative party promised a niqab ban at citizenship ceremonies would be its first legislative act. The Bloc supports that Conservative proposal. But Harper made co-operation with the separatist BQ politically toxic in the 2008 prorogation crisis, damning them as a nationally divisive partner in any coalition.\nConservative strategists and insiders, speaking on background, are frank: a majority is not in the cards if it ever was.\nBut now there are two distinct camps on whether a minority is even within reach.\nSome are downright gloomy, saying the party is losing big. Others are stoic, mindful the party’s big voter identification and get-out-the-vote machine has pulled out wins in the end — like in 2011 when naysayers were surprised.\nHarper says only that whoever wins the most seats will govern the country.\nOf his own future, he says little. Just that he’s got the best job in the country and would like to continue doing it.\nAt the outset of the campaign, sources told the Star Harper appeared set to hang on to lead the Conservatives even if one of his rivals won a tenuous minority, believing it would be unstable and short-lived, and that he would be best-placed to lead the Conservatives back to power.\nHarper has seemed zen on the campaign trail this week, even energized at a few evening rallies that have drawn larger crowds, but his touring campaign exudes an air of fatigue. Staff are tired, sick and flagging. Harper seems more at ease than those around him.\nHe told CBC in September that if he doesn’t win the most seats “I would not serve as prime minister.”\nTo some it suggested Harper would quit but in fact it just states the obvious.\nWith files from Joanna Smith and Les Whittington\nMore on thestar.com\nWhat 2011 federal election results look like in 2015’s new riding boundaries\nWhy concern for the environment doesn’t boost Green party fortunes", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:08:52.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
