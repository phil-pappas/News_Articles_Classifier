(Photo: Mike Carter-USA TODAY Sports) \nEAST LANSING -- If the Michigan State depth chart can be taken as a hint, injured right tackle Kodi Kieler may be close to returning -- he's on it this week as a co-starter, after he didn't appear a week ago. \nKieler has been out since injuring his knee in the second game against Oregon. Left tackle Jack Conklin missed Saturday's 24-21 win over Purdue with a knee injury suffered a week earlier against CMU. \nThe No. 4 Spartans (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) actually have co-starters at every single offensive line position on the depth chart entering Saturday night's game at Rutgers (2-2, 0-1). \nThat's center Jack Allen or Conklin at left tackle; Brian Allen or David Beedle at left guard; Jack Allen or Brian Allen at center; Benny McGowan or Donavon Clark at right guard; and Clark or Kieler at right tackle. \nMSU coach Mark Dantonio didn't give any solid updates on who may be available at today's news conference and said it probably won't be until Friday when the staff knows and decides on who will start where. \nAlso on the depth chart, freshman Josh Butler is now a No. 2 cornerback. Dantonio said of Butler being activated: \"He's probably right there. We're trying to hold (the redshirt), we'll see what happens.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1Lg1azQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:21:41.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
