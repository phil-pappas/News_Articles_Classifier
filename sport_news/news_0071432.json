Image 9 of 9 Schuylerville football uses early momentum swing to top Glens Falls 1 / 9 Back to Gallery Schuylerville\nAs his squad prepared for Friday's Class B West Division title showdown at Schuylerville, Glens Falls football coach Pat Lilac believed his Indians needed to capitalize on their scoring chances early and avoid playing from behind against the Black Horses' flexbone offensive attack that grinds through and wears down opponents weekly.\nGlens Falls had two drives reach the red zone in the opening half, but both resulted in turnovers. Lilac's worst fears were realized during those first 24 minutes, and then Schuylerville's strength up front helped generate two quick touchdowns in the third quarter as the Black Horses collected their second straight West Division title with a convincing 33-0 victory over Glens Falls.\n\"It feels very good to play a high-caliber team and put everything together,\" Schuylerville running back Skyler Bateman said. \"We had one of the best weeks of practice we've had in a long time. That preparation really translated into the game.\"\nThe Black Horses (6-0, 5-0 division), ranked No. 5 in the state, rolled up 488 yards on offense — including 449 yards rushing on 56 carries. Bateman led a balanced ground game with 139 yards on 14 carries and senior quarterback Will Griffen contributed 73 yards and three touchdowns to push his rushing TD total to 16.\nAs impressive as Schuylerville's offense performed, its defensive unit also excelled. The Indians (5-1, 3-1), rated No. 11 in the state, entered Friday's game having scored 242 points. They were limited to 152 yards Friday.\n\"We knew they had a lot of athletes. To shut them down is huge for us,\" Schuylerville senior running back/defensive back Joe Vanderhoof said. \"This shows we have a very dominant defense.\"\n\"This is very encouraging going forward — a real boost to our confidence,\" Bateman said.\nThe Black Horses marched 81 yards over nine rushing plays with the second series to reach the end zone for the first time. Zach Pierce completed that drive with a 16-yard TD scamper during which the senior dashed right and cut back sharply left against an over-pursuing defense.\nEarly in the second quarter, Glens Falls took over in Schuylerville territory following a short punt. The Indians later looked to tie the score when junior quarterback Josh Griffen threw the ball toward receiver Andrew Murphy .\nVanderhoof proceeded to position himself in front of Murphy and intercepted the ball in the end zone for the touchback. The senior credited assistant Jack Burger on his big play.\n\"I saw the ball in the air and knew (Murphy) was going to the corner,\" Vanderhoof said. \" Coach Burger always tells us to play the ball and almost be the offensive guy. He says to high-point the ball and I went up and got it.\"\n\"That was a huge play. I'm glad we have so many playmakers on this team like him,\" Bateman said of Vanderhoof.\nSchuylerville made Glens Falls' first turnover sting more as it drove 80 yards over 13 plays, capped by a seven-yard touchdown run by Will Griffen, to extend the lead to 12-0 with 7:35 remaining in the second quarter.\n\"As much as it was momentum for us (making the interception), it is a killer to the other team,\" Vanderhoof said. \"To pick them off and shut them down in the red zone, then go 80 yards says a lot about our team.\"\n\"Winning the turnover battle is a huge key to the game,\" Griffen said. \"To get the 80-yard drive and score is a momentum-booster for us and kills their morale.\"\nThe Black Horses scored on their next possession to grab a 20-0 lead as Griffen reached the end zone on a four-yard run and Tanner Dunkel added a two-point conversion run. Glens Falls proceeded to put together a 60-yard drive just before halftime, but Pierce registered an interception to conclude the second quarter.\nSchuylerville coach John Bowen certainly was pleased with the Black Horses' overall showing in the opening half and came away even more encouraged by his team's performance in the third quarter. The Black Horses stopped the Indians on their first possession after intermission and proceeded to gallop 83 yards in only four plays — with Griffen scoring on a one-yard TD run — to push the advantage to 27-0.\n\"We put a big stress on the final three minutes of the first half and the first three minutes of the second half, that those were the most critical of the game,\" Bowen said. \"We got the critical pick to end the first half and get the stop on their initial drive of the second half.\"\nBateman culminated the scoring with a 23-yard touchdown run with 2:32 left in the third quarter.\n\"The offensive line was tremendous and didn't allow them to get back into the game,\" Bateman said.\n\"We knew we had to work. We did what we needed to do to get the job done,\" Griffen said.\njallen@timesunion.com • 518-454-5062 • @TUSidelines", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767898/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767897/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767892/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767895/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767888/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767898/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767887/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767896/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767895/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767887/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767890/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767896/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767888/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767897/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767892/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/46/8767890/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:20:29.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
