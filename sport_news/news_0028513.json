This year, the Ballon d'Or is reserved for Messi, the best player in the world has already been named. For everything he's done, Leo deserves it,\" Neymar told Mundo Deportivo. \nHe also claims that one day he'd like to emulate his team-mate and win the biggest individual award in the game himself. \n\"I hope to grow playing alongside Messi. He's the best and an idol for me. And if I learn a lot then maybe one day I can win. \n\"Of course I want to be in the top three, that would be great for me.\" \nWith Messi continuing his recovery from a knee injury, Neymar insisted he can handle the pressure of leading the line for Barcelona as he has to for his country. \n\"Since I was young, I've always assumed responsibilities, for Santos, for the national team,\" he said. \n\"But here it's different, we know our responsibility, what we have to do on the pitch, and I'm going to do everything to help my team-mates. \n\"The challenge doesn't scare me even though I know it's difficult. \n\"Leo's fine. It's a delicate injury but he looks good and looks to be very happy with his recovery.\" \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
