As it was a scratch race and only 40 laps we thought why not, I'll just do it, and I just didn't panic, I guess. \n\"It was like that little break went away and everyone was looking at me to work and I was like, 'I don't need to work, this isn't my race to lose'.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:08:43.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
