Making somebody disappear — having something to do with their abduction — having something to do with a murder, that’s kind of extreme. That is a huge leap,” Potts told Mitchell.\nBut it isn’t a far-fetched scenario for prosecutors, who plan to call Potts’ ex-wife and another former girlfriend, both of whom have said he repeatedly beat them.\nAt least two women were granted orders of protection against Potts, a career criminal who once slipped out of his handcuffs while in FBI custody.\nFranklin, who casually dated Potts for a few months in 2006 and 2007, had filed a police report about her ex roughly a week before Sept. 18, 2007 — the day she was last seen alive at her University Village condo.\nAround that time, she also sent her friends an email about Potts’ criminal past, which prosecutors said sent him into a rage.\nIn a threatening call to the 28-year-old Franklin, Potts told her “he could have her erased,” prosecutors said.\nPotts was caught on surveillance cameras walking with Franklin in her building’s elevators and parking garage before she disappeared, authorities said.\nFranklin’s body was discovered Sept. 27. Her 2005 Chevy Impala was found just a mile away, in Hammond, Indiana, near the gas station where police say Potts was picked up by friends.\nDuring the ride home, Potts allegedly used Franklin’s cellphone to ring 911 three times. He didn’t say a word, prosecutors said.\nBut Potts’ silence wasn’t throwing anyone off, according prosecutors, who say cell tower records show his phone was at Franklin’s condo, the Dan Ryan Expressway and in Calumet City where the young woman’s pharmaceuticals and jewelry turned up.\nDefense attorneys are expected to stress that the case against Potts is circumstantial at best.\nHowever, prosecutors hope the alleged domestic abuse detailed in court records will help jurors understand the level of violence authorities say he is capable of.\nFranklin had told police that Potts “had been physical — not with me, but with other women,” according to court documents.\nDuring their 2005 marriage, Nataly Figueroa said Potts punched her so hard while she was driving on the highway that she had to pull off the road because her eye was swelling, obscuring her vision.\nFigueroa said Potts also choked and smothered her with a pillow when she was pregnant.\nA day before their second child was born, Figueroa said Potts grabbed her by the arm, causing her to fall on the floor.\nAnd when Figueroa said she wanted a divorce, she said Potts clocked her in the ear.\nFigueroa said when she would threaten to call police, Potts told her the police wouldn’t respond right away — and, he warned her, he could “cause a lot of damage in that time.”\nIna Dorsey, another woman who had a child with Potts, said he was rough with as her as well when they dated in 2007.\nIn one alleged incident, which prosecutors are not allowed to discuss at trial, Dorsey’s family home in Maywood ended up riddled with bullet holes.\nA relative of Dorsey’s said she got a call the next day from Potts. “Next time,” she said he warned her, “they won’t miss.”", "external_links": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/REGINALDPOTTS-150x150.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/REGINALDPOTTS.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:49:28.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
