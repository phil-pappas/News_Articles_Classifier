That would be coach Gary Pettis, 57 years old and in his 36th season of professional baseball. \nOn his way to the big leagues in the California Angels organization, Pettis played 120 games for the 1981 Holyoke club. He hit .266, stole 55 bases and made playing center field look easy. He reached the majors in '82, and stayed for 11 seasons, mainly because of his defense and speed. \nHis playing career for four organizations - California, Detroit, Texas and San Diego - included five Gold Gloves in center field, and 354 stolen bases. In 1985, Pettis stole a career-high 56, ranking him second in the American League to Rickey Henderson's 80 for the New York Yankees. \nAs for those Millers, they came to Holyoke in 1977, then moved to Nashua, N.H., after the '82 season. \nTHEY'RE FAMOUS: With the recent election of Bruce Landon and Bruce Cline, Springfield now has 13 representatives in the American Hockey League's Hall of Fame. \nThe AHL's first Hall of Fame class in 2006 included Eddie Shore, who owned the Springfield Indians franchise from 1939 to 1976; and Jack Butterfield, a former Springfield hockey general manager who later served as AHL president for 28 years. \nThe league's shrine includes seven players from Springfield's three straight Calder Cup champions of the early 1960s - Jim Anderson, Bruce Cline, Marcel Paille, Harry Pidhirny, Noel Price, Art Stratton and Bill Sweeney. \nHall of Famers Bronco Horvath from the early '50s and Bruce Boudreau from the '80s also played for the Indians. The Springfield Falcons are represented by their first captain, John Stevens; and Landon, co-founder of the franchise and still the club's director of hockey operations. Stevens also played for the Indians before they were moved to Worcester. \nFALL-STAR SHOW: The Western Mass. High School Fall Baseball League is now in its seventh season, under the leadership of Bill Bathel and Mark DiFranco. \nOn Sunday, the league takes a break from its regular varsity and junior varsity schedules to play all-star games, hosted by Springfield College. The junior varsity game will be played at 9 a.m., the varsity at 2. \nProfessional instructors Chris Corkum and Peter Fatse will address the players regarding preparing for college, pursuing academic and baseball goals, and what to consider if recruited. \nFall league playoffs will begin next weekend, with championship games in each division set for Oct. 25 at Springfield College. \nThe league has 28 teams, 19 in the varsity division. \nCALLING CITY FAMERS: Springfield's Public Schools Sports Hall of Fame committee is just about set for its 2015 induction ceremonies, but does need to clear up a few details. \nFor instance, committee chairman Mike Martin needs to hear from inductees Dwayne Kirby of Sci-Tech and James Hester of Putnam so they can be sent letters of invitation to the ceremony and dinner. \nWith teams being honored for the first time, the School Department's Athletic Office also would like to hear from any of their players who plan to attend. \nTickets to the enshrinement program, at $45, will be available soon through the athletic department. For any information about the Hall of Fame's big night, call Martin's office at (413) 787-7126. \nUMASS AND YOGI: The Sept. 22 passing of New York Yankees great Yogi Berra brought to mind the fact that he had a rooting interest in the University of Massachusetts. \nYogi's son, Tim, played at UMass from 1971 to 1973 as a kick returner and wide receiver in the football coaching era of Dick MacPherson. In 1972, UMass went 9-2 and beat Cal-Davis 35-14 in the Boardwalk Bowl at Atlantic City. \nAs a senior in 1973, Tim Berra set the school's season records for receiving yards with 922 and receiving touchdowns with 12. He also held the school record for career receiving yards with 1,486. Those records have since been broken. \nIn 1974, Tim Berra played one season on special teams with the Baltimore Colts. \nHis younger brother, Dale, played 11 seasons of big league baseball, including three as starting shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates. \nBEST BET for the weekend: Blingo, in the Knickerbocker Stakes at Belmont. \nGarry Brown can be reached at geebrown1918@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:09:41.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
