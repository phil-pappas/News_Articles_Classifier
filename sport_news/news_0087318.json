It's a small amount for a district with a $423 million operating budget, but they're planning to fight it.\nFor Nezbeda, president of the parent group Beaverton Community for Education, the lawsuit involving school building use fees isn't about the money.\n\"Communication, accountability and transparency,\" Nezbeda said. \"We want to see that out of the policy and rule makers in the school district.\"\nRead more Previous story about Beaverton School District building use fees Nezbeda has previously come before the board asking for clarification about fees for using district facilities. Beaverton Community for Education runs several free after school programs for kids and has been simultaneously charged and not charged for the programs, depending on the school.\nBut it was a girls' empowerment summit in June that tipped the scale. Nezbeda claims the district failed to tell her about potential custodian costs to clean up after the Saturday summit and didn't respond when she emailed facility staff with questions.\nThe parents behind Beaverton Community for Education had spent three months preparing for a girls empowerment summit when they learned the day before the event that they owed the district $583 for 11 hours of custodian labor.\nLinda Nezbeda, president of the Beaverton Community for Education parent group is leading the charge in a $583 small claims lawsuit against the school district. Wendy Owen/Staff Rather than cancel the free event at Mountain View Middle School , which drew 700 girls, or ask them to pay a fee, the parents scrambled to find the $583 facility use fee.\nThe summit targeted girls from low-income families and was meant to inspire them to stay active and healthy, Nezbeda said.\n\"I called everyone I could think of,\" she said. \"We just raised it.\"\nThe summit was a success, she said, and included Mayor Denny Doyle, Superintendent Jeff Rose and Beaverton record-setting swimmer Michelle Macy.\nBut the fee perplexed Nezbeda, who said she had previously held legislative forums at the middle school gym and never paid a fee. She also questioned how the district came up with 11 hours of custodian time. Volunteers spent a couple of hours cleaning up after the four-hour event.\nDistrict spokeswoman Maureen Wheeler said the district has denied the claim and the case will go to mediation.\nAmong the points the district contested is Nezbeda's claim that the charge was a surprise. The district said Nezbeda was told three months before the event that there and would be custodial costs. The amount, however, was not determined.\nAs for the amount, the district wrote that typically principals estimate the amount of custodial services needed and may readjust those hours after the event. \"Charges and payment are made after the conclusion of the event,\" according to the district's reply in the case.\nThe district has since revamped its facility use guidelines, but has not, yet, adjusted fees.\nNezbeda said she doesn't trust the system and doesn't plan to run any of the after school programs this year.\n\"We want this to change,\" she said. \"We're only getting started.\"\n-- Wendy Owen\nwowen@oregonian.com\n@bvrtnreporter\n@wowen1\n503-294-5961", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bvrtnreporter", "https://twitter.com/wowen1", "https://www.facebook.com/BeavertonCommunityforEducation", "https://www.beaverton.k12.or.us/schools/mountain-view/"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:52:12.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
