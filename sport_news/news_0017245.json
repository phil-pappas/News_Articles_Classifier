He produces a break of 123 in the second against his wildcard opponent.In the third frame, Tang fails to pot a black right around the pocket. That mistake is all Ding needs, and the home favorite manages to clear the table to lead 3-0.The fourth frame sees Ding take firm control after sinking a long-range red. With very little drama, the World Number Three makes a break of 69, and wins the match 4-0 after only one hour at the table, to reach the Last 32.\"We played quite fast. Four frames in one hour is close to my record when I'm training. He was a very good player when I was young, but now I think he couldn't concentrate on crucial balls. He should have played better,\" Ding said. Related Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:25:36.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
