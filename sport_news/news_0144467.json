(Courtesy SDSU) FARGO, N.D. - \nTwo Dakotas teams that have become recent rivals in the Football Championship Subdivision are already meeting for bragging rights - and more. More from KDLT Oregon Governor Says Shooter Was 20-Year-Old Man \nFour-time defending Football Championship Subdivision winners North Dakota State travels to South Dakota State to open play in the Missouri Valley Football Conference, a league that has five schools ranked in the top 10. \nThe Bison (2-1) defeated historic rival North Dakota in their last game, an event that brought plenty of buzz but was no contest. The Bison expect a stiff test against the Jackrabbits (3-0). \nSDSU coach John Stiegelmeier says the rivalry adds \"that juice to it\" and expects a stadium-record crowd in Brookings. \nNDSU coach Chris Klieman says it's a big game but there will still be a \"ton of football\" left in the season.
