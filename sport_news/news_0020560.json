USC (2-4, 0-4 SEC) is off to its slowest start since the winless 1999 campaign. Prior to last weekend’s loss at LSU, two players cleared by doctors chose not to compete. Afterward, a few others took veiled shots over social media. No wonder, then, Spurrier sensed it was the moment to step down. “I feel like it happened at the right time,” said senior safety Isaiah Johnson. The large banner bearing his image still hangs outside the stadium, and he still haunts his old office on occasion, but “the Steve Spurrier era of Carolina football is over,” as USC president Harris Pastides put it at the Head Ball Coach’s resignation announcement Tuesday. What the next era might look like is yet to be determined. In the meantime, there remains half a season to be played, and a steely-eyed offensive line coach to oversee it. Shawn Elliott’s first game day as South Carolina’s interim head coach will begin early — with a 7:30 a.m. appearance on ESPN’s “SportsCenter” program, broadcasting live from the USC Horseshoe. Later, he’ll be part of a “Gamecock Walk” which will include not only current players, but also a number of former football lettermen. Then it’s a 4 p.m. kickoff against Vanderbilt (2-3, 0-2), where Elliott wants an atmosphere that mirrors the intensity he brings to every game. “We want it to be like a rock concert in there,” he said on his first “Carolina Calls” radio program. It’s a strange dynamic, this idea that an interim head coach can somehow buoy a team mired in a down season. But Vanderbilt head coach Derek Mason has witnessed it firsthand — in 2013, when he was an assistant at Stanford, and the Cardinal were beaten by a Southern California squad coached by Ed Orgeron, who had taken over for the fired Lane Kiffin seven weeks earlier. “There’s that emotional push, there’s that emotional wave, probably within the first quarter or the first 10 minutes of that ballgame where the stadium, the fans, everyone wants to get back to football and get back to some sense of normalcy,” Mason said. “... That community (in South Carolina) is going to come out. It’s going to be loud. Our guys are going to have to withstand that initial force.” The Trojans won seven of their final nine games, although it wasn’t enough to land Orgeron the full-time gig. Clemson experienced something similar after Tommy Bowden was ousted five games into the 2008 season and Dabo Swinney took over on an interim basis. Swinney finished the regular season 4-2, and has been the Tigers’ head coach ever since. “It’s a huge transition. It’s very difficult,” Swinney said. “First of all, you’ve got a ton of emotion involved. You’ve got a lot of factions, there’s different groups. You’ve got a whole football team that did not come there for you to be their head coach. And yet, you’ve got to push that aside and get everybody to understand it’s bigger than any one person. At the end of the day, regardless what the scoreboard says, you have an opportunity to send a message that you’re not going to quit.” Elliott has certainly tried to safeguard against that, pushing the tempo in practice and pumping music over the loudspeakers — the latter something Spurrier did only during warm-ups. It was USC’s captains who convinced athletics director Ray Tanner that Elliott was right for the interim role, and a number of players say the changes have been welcome. “Choosing coach Elliott was probably one of the best decisions we could have made right now,” Johnson said. “He brings a lot of passion, a lot of energy. He’s very emotional, and that’s the kind of guy we need.” In lobbying for the job, Elliott told Tanner he wanted to restore the pride and passion that had become “hidden away” over USC’s first six games. That emotional wave an interim coach can bring was already beginning to swell. “Our team has rallied, let me tell you,” Elliott said on his radio program. “I don’t know if they’ve rallied around me, but they’ve rallied around themselves and their other teammates and the other coaches, and our entire staff. It’s a remarkable thing.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:31:04.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
