The two squads combined for 100 points in what was a true Mid-American Conference shootout. \nFor Cardinals head coach Pete Lembo, there are two ways of looking back at the game. \n“From a fan’s perspective, it was an exciting game,” he said. “We always talk about ‘MACtion’ and what we pride ourselves on as a conference. I think that game lived up to it in a lot of ways. \n“From a coach’s perspective, that’s not always what you want.” \nNorthern Illinois matched every offensive success Ball State had in the last three quarters of the game — and then some. The Cardinals called the game aggressively, going for it on three fourth downs and converting all of them. \nThey played at an up-tempo pace, where freshman quarterback Riley Neal looked comfortable. And Lembo was happy with the pass-run balance despite Ball State’s second-lowest rushing total this season of 110 yards. \nBut the defense simply could not get a stop. \n“Our defense struggled,” Lembo said. “It got off to a good start, and it was downhill from there. … There were times when we were overmatched physically. There were other times where some of our guys just didn’t cut it loose.” \nLembo would like to see defenders play a bit more aggressively, instead of “trying not to get beat.” One guy that stood out this week was safety Lamont McPhatter. He was on the field because of other players’ injuries — which continue to mount for the entire team — but he played like he was supposed to start. \nHe kept his foot on the gas and played 91 snaps of solid defense. \n“I’m not saying he played at an all-conference level against Northern,” Lembo said of the sophomore. “But he went 91 snaps. He did some good things, he flew around, he was fearless.” \nThere are 10 players on this week’s injury report, including senior linebacker Ben Ingle; cornerbacks Corey Hall and Tyree Holder; safeties Dedrick Cromartie and Terin Solomon; and senior defensive lineman Darnell Smith — who has been out with a knee injury all season. \nSome names not on the injury report this week are important as well. \nFifth-year defensive tackle Keenan Noel is listed as a possible starter at nose guard alongside John Whitman III. He played some at Northern Illinois despite being listed as “out” on the injury report last week. \nGeorgia State (1-4, 1-1 Sun Belt) has only rushed for 486 yards through five games this season. By comparison, Ball State has rushed for 1,064 yards through six games and that’s after a pair of pretty sluggish performances. \nIt’s surely a welcome sight for a defense that hasn’t been able to get its bearings in three straight games. That was the downfall, after all, in the team’s loss to Northern Illinois. \n“We just didn’t make any plays,” Lembo said. “We didn’t get a tackle for a loss when we needed it, we didn’t get a sack when we needed it, we didn’t get a pass breakup when we needed it.” \nContact Ball State sports reporter Dakota Crawford at dmcrawford@muncie.gannett.com and follow him @DakotaCrawford_ . 3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1hD8fyr TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:40:01.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
