It has extra significant meaning. \n\"Being involved in the derby is a privilege, a unique experience. But you can only enjoy it if you win,\" he added. \n\"The players are very much focused and aware how important the game is.\" \nThe 42-year-old admitted his team would have to be wary of Liverpool, especially the fit-again Daniel Sturridge, who has five goals against them in the league, but said he was more focussed on his own players. \n\"From our point of view, it's about us. \n\"We respect the opposition, we know we will see a team with a lot of experience and huge investment behind it. It doesn't affect how we go about it. \n\"I don't measure success by comparing our squad with other teams. I develop a squad window after window, and I am delighted with what I have,\" he said. \nMartinez confirmed that all the players who featured in the 3-2 win over West Bromwich Albion were fit, but said John Stones and Seamus Coleman would need late fitness checks to see if they could make the squad. \n(Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty ) \nOur top photos from the month of September.
