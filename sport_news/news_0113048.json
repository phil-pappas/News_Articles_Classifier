Barrett was always an Urban Meyer kind of guy and an Urban Meyer kind of quarterback. Now he's back to starting in an Urban Meyer kind of offense.\nMeyer announced Tuesday that the fifth-place finisher in the 2014 Heisman Trophy balloting will make his first start of the 2015 season in Ohio State's eighth game at Rutgers on Saturday night. This is Meyer winding up back where many thought he would have started the season after taking a pothole-filled path that never tripped up the Buckeyes, at least in the loss column.\n• \"J.T. has earned the right to start\"\nYou get a vibe now that this is what those around the program want, especially after the way the offense, relying almost exclusively on the legs of Barrett and Ezekiel Elliott, moved in the second half against Penn State.\nYou also got the vibe earlier that Barrett to begin with was what more than a few people around the program expected from the start. Barrett beat out Jones in the 2014 preseason, played well in his first season of college football, got hurt, and then didn't get his job back from the guy who replaced him until late October.\nThe end result is that it didn't matter. Ohio State mucked around with the quarterback question for more than half the regular season and emerged undefeated and still No. 1.\nGreat. No harm. But that doesn't mean there weren't some fouls.\nIn the end, it seems like Barrett is the player he was all along. And Jones never quite had the pieces in place to show what he could be. Neither of those things are a surprise.\nSo why did it happen this way?\nMeyer shot for the stars, taking a risk on Jones' big upside. He did it knowing that Barrett, the ultimate good soldier, would stay at the ready in any circumstance. It may have been a risk worth taking, because with the easy schedule and Barrett's easy nature, if it didn't work this possibility -- back to J.T. -- would always be there.\nIt was also a risk that maybe didn't have much of a chance of working the way things went around the quarterback. Jones didn't seize the day. That's clear. But these seem to be some facts in how this quarterback decision evolved:\n• Meyer picked the strong-armed wild-card Twitter star with a little more boom and bust potential over the steadier great leader elected a captain as a sophomore.\n• That competition winner played pretty well against a tough Virginia Tech secondary in week one, throwing for 187 yards and running for 99.\n• In week two, when Jones struggled off a short week, he was replaced after four drives with a 7-0 lead.\n• After returning in the second half of that game, Jones was replaced again the next week in the second quarter, with Barrett this time playing the rest of the game against Northern Illinois. The move led Jones, a star on social media as much as on the football field, to express frustration on Twitter about what he viewed as a demotion. He later said that was childish.\n• So now week four. The offensive line still hadn't played well. The Buckeyes hadn't developed a deep threat to replace Devin Smith, which is how Jones made his best plays last year. Trying to cram Braxton Miller into the offense, sometimes at quarterback, led to Jones losing rhythm and facing tough circumstances when Miller would take a snap and lose yardage. The play-calling structure, after the loss of Tom Herman, was a problem and eventually changed. All this happened while the quarterbacks were expected to grow and lead an offense while adjusting to new quarterback coach Tim Beck.\nJones missed on six deep balls, with the game plan finally letting him go down the field. He underthrew them, a strange reality for a guy with a cannon, but didn't get much help from receivers who don't make plays on the ball the way Smith did.\nThe Buckeyes vowed to fix that.\n• Week five was nearly a loss to Indiana. Jones was the guy, and though he was 18 for 27 for 245 yards, a touchdown and an interception, the Buckeyes were dangerously ineffective near the end zone. Part of that was Jones missing throws. Part of that was the Buckeyes forgetting to call Elliott's number in the red zone and getting away from the run game.\n• The Buckeyes had clearly given up on the quarterback run at this point, which is usually a focus of a Meyer offense. That's a choice Meyer made. But the Buckeyes also still hadn't really flowed into a Jones type of offense, the big-arm throws called around Elliott runs that worked against better competition last postseason.\n• So here came a red zone quarterback for week six against Maryland. Barrett got a clear role alongside Jones, and it worked. The Terrapins weren't much of a test, but this could be a long-term solution.\n• The Buckeyes did it against Penn State, but with the talented PSU defensive line teeing off on the pocket passer, Jones didn't look as sharp. When Barrett entered with that run threat, Penn State was forced to back off and Barrett's read-option mastery worked like a charm.\nAnd the switch was made.\nThe outcome is Barrett as the prodigal son returning to lead the offense and Jones, to some, as an outcast. That, of course, isn't fair. The Buckeyes wouldn't have won the National Championship last season without both of them.\nIt just turned out that losing two quarterbacks in 2014 may have been easier than having two quarterbacks in 2015.\nThe Buckeyes are back probably to where they should have been all along. The circumstances and choices made wound up making Barrett look like more of a savior and Jones like more of a problem than is real in either case.\nThe only issue for the Buckeyes was having a plan by Michigan State. Whether that was Jones or Barrett, or some kind of combo like the Maryland game, the only goal for that week 11 showdown of potential undefeated teams is total confidence in the quarterback in all corners.\nThe Buckeyes should find that with Barrett, a natural front man with great wheels and instincts who showed last year (if not this year yet) that he can make the necessary throws.\nThe Buckeyes could have found that with Jones. But he needed smart play-calling and receivers to grab those deep tosses. And he needed unbridled confidence in himself, the kind he showed last year when he was the last and only choice at quarterback.\nThe play-calling, which has clearly improved, still never fit him. No one is Devin Smith. And once he was yanked in week two and three, a message was sent that maybe Jones -- who started underthrowing deep balls and checking down more often -- never forgot.\nMeyer didn't win three championship rings by playing it safe. And the best gamble to take is the one where if you lose, you still keep all your money.\nThe Buckeyes are fine. Barrett and the offense look ready to roll. But the way this bet was played, it never had much of a chance of paying off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:40:20.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
