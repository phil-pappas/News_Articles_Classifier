Sources said due to unavailability of playgrounds and lack of adequate space in private schools in the city, students do not engage in games or physical training. They added that the situation is alarming in old city areas like Pacca Danga, Chowk Chabutra, etc, where academies are being run in small areas. The sources added that some schools had such a small space that it was not even possible to organise 50-m race. “Under the SRO 123 of the J&K School Education Act of 2002, the private schools seeking affiliation/recognition/permission should have required infrastructure for conducting physical activities. Further, it is mandatory for every private school to have one room for indoor games with area not less than 150 sq m,” an official said. “What to talk of taking strict action against these erring institutions, the department is not even bother to prepare a list of private educational institutions which lack playground facilities. A lot of stress is being laid by the authorities on introducing physical education subject in government as well as private schools, but what is the benefit if physical activities are not taking place due to lack of playgrounds,” he added. When contacted, JK Sudan, Chief Education Officer (CEO), Jammu, admitted that so many private schools in the city lacked playground facilities and running in small buildings. “Yes, it is true that many private educational institutions are running in small buildings where they have no provision of a playground, which is mandatory under SRO 123,” said the CEO, Jammu. When asked about whether any action has been taken by the department against these erring institutions, Sudan said, “The matter is to be taken up by the higher authorities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:20:10.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
