The 17-year from Chennai was named the Most Valuable Player of the Junior Basketball Nationals that concluded in Ludhiana recently. “The physical education teacher at his school,” said Hariram’s teammate R Karthik. Hariram, who scored 20 points in the final against Punjab to help his team win the Nationals, started playing basketball five years ago. Where does he train? “In his school,” said Karthik. Today, when almost every top athlete, especially in the northern states, is a product of some high-profile academy — state-run or private —Hariram’s answer sounded incredible. And Hariram, an India camper, was not the only one to have come out of the school system. “Most of these boys train at their schools. Basketball is very popular in schools, especially in the bigger cities. In Chennai alone, there are over 30 schools which have very competitive basketball teams,” said Tamil Nadu coach D James. “Also, there is a sports hostel in every district. So we get to choose from a big pool and only the best make the team. That is why our teams have been so successful,” added James, who is a coach with the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) in Chennai. While the Tamil Nadu boys were busy cutting down the net to take back as a souvenir, the Karnataka girls took turns taking pictures with the runners-up trophy at the other end. Just like their neighbours Tamil Nadu, the Karnataka teams have also been constantly featuring in the top four. However, the secret of Karnataka’s success has been a flourishing club scene. “There are over 60 clubs in Karnataka, most of them in the bigger cities like Bangalore, Mangalore and Mysore,” said Karnataka girls’ team coach Mohan Kumar. “Most of the clubs are as old as 40 years. There are teams in all the categories — from the junior to the senior levels. And the clubs keep playing matches and tournaments throughout the year,” said Kumar, who coaches at the Beagles Basketball Club in Bangalore. Kumar said the clubs don’t get any help from the government. On the contrary, the high level of competition in the clubs has forced the government to improve the level of its academies. Punjab of past\nCompared with these states, the situation in Punjab seems disappointing. The Ludhiana academy is the only proper boys’ academy in the state and it is supported by a few smaller centres. For the girls, there are only two academies in the state — one in Amritsar and one in Ludhiana — with about 40 trainees in total. While the Tamil Nadu and Karnataka coaches boasted that their teams were composed of players from all over their states, in Punjab’s case, the majority of the boys were trainees of the Ludhiana academy and the girls from the two centres mentioned. But what has hit the state the most has been the disappearance of sports from schools. In fact, that’s the case in general — apart from a few exceptions, there is no sport being played in the schools. But the situation was not always this way. Ask any veteran athlete and the answer would be the same. “Back then, everyone trained at the schools. And almost every school, in the cities or the villages, had very competitive teams in different sports. Not only that, almost everyone played some sport or the other — the physical education teachers made sure of that,” said Punjab Basketball Association’s honorary secretary general Teja Singh Dhaliwal. Dhaliwal added that every village was in some way like a club. “We trained together and played together against other villages. There used to be inter-village tournaments and the competition used to be very tough,” he said. However, the situation has drastically deteriorated, the origins of which go back to the militancy days. Just like everything else, sport was also hit badly then. A link was broken, but even decades later, the apathetic administrators have not made the effort to revive the condition. What was once a way of life, sport has now become a means to a job, with a majority of the sportspersons coming from the underprivileged backgrounds. Which is why it was heartening to find out that the Karnataka and Tamil Nadu teams had players from every kind of background. Hariram belongs to a middle-class family. The 6’1” youngster is a big fan of current India player Vishesh Bhriguvanshi, who is an ONGC employee. Despite ONGC being the top team in the country, Hariram said he did not think about joining the team. His dream is to play for India and join the Army. It is not wrong to seek a livelihood through sports. But in Punjab, the government has failed to provide jobs, the one major motivation for taking up sports. These are the reasons why Punjab, which was once arguably No. 1. in sports in the nation, has slipped down. The situation is no different in the other states in the region — Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. And it is precisely why the southern states — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala — have risen to the top. It can be argued, in the case of basketball, that Punjab has constantly been among the medallists, at least in the men’s section. But the bigger question arises, is winning titles the sole reason to play sports? There can’t be more than 300 boys and girls playing basketball in the state. However, according to James and Kumar, there are thousands playing the sport in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — rich, poor, some seriously and some as a hobby.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:12:24.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
