Scheduled once every fall, Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables and his defensive players endure a test of mental and physical endurance that could be described annoying at best and excruciating at worst. Georgia Tech’s triple option has a way of exposing cavities in even the most well-scrubbed of defenses. The Yellow Jackets have rushed for 30,601 yards since head coach Paul Johnson’s arrival at the start of 2009, more than any other rushing offense in the country. It’s that vaunted triple option again. The one that made Venables utter “thank God that’s over” immediately after his first clash with the Rambling Wreck three years ago. The matchup that Clemson (and Georgia, and ACC Coastal defenses) have grown to tolerate instead of embrace. “This style of offense, you recognize the margin for error isn’t much at all,” Venables said. “Literally on any particular play where a guy loses his footing or is slightly out-leveraged or slows down on a cut block or stares at the wrong thing, it can be six points. “They’re really good at exploiting discipline issues and technique issues, where you can get away with that against other schemes. It’s a lot of stress, mentally and physically for coaches and players.” There is a glass-half-full approach to facing Georgia Tech’s offense, and Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney. See, by definition, the triple option gives the quarterback three options: hand it off, tuck and run, or drop and throw. Kind of like Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson’s three options out of the zone-read. “You don’t see a lot of teams these days that line up and run the triple option every single play,” Swinney said. “But we run some triple option; we just do it a different way. “Their style of play is tight splits, cut you, guys arching out, violent misdirection all over the field. The quarterback is in control of it, just like our quarterback is, it’s just a different presentation.” For instance, mere moments before Watson ran for 38 yards on the first play from scrimmage Saturday in Clemson’s 24-22 win over Notre Dame, Watson possessed the choice of running, giving the ball to tailback Wayne Gallman or a quick throw to one of his four skill players split out wide. “If you really look, what we’re doing and what they’re doing is not a whole lot different, they’re just doing it out of the gun,” Johnson said of the Tigers. “We don’t zone block as much, but the principles are the same, I think if you ask Coach Swinney, he’d tell you the same thing.” Georgia Tech has lost three straight games, but remains atop the Atlantic Coast Conference rushing leaderboard by nearly the length of a football field. The Yellow Jackets’ 311.8 yards per game dwarfs the nearest foe, North Carolina at 219.8 yards per game. To hear a player readying to face Georgia Tech’s system for the first time was refreshing. Clemson true freshman defensive tackle Christian Wilkins never faced the system in high school at Suffield (Conn.) Academy, though he got his first taste of the triple option in the opener against Wofford. “It’s going to help because I have a better understanding of what to do against the triple option, like what’s the primary roles of the defensive players and how to take it on,” Wilkins said. “But Georgia Tech runs it different than anybody, and they run it very effectively. “You want to play fast and you want to be physical, but you’ve got to be prepared mentally for the cut blocks. It’s about staying low so you get your hands on them as soon as they go for your legs.” The Yellow Jackets are ravaged by injury, missing A-Backs Nate Cottrell, Qua Searcy and Broderick Snoddy and B-Back C.J. Leggett. But their biggest individual threat to light up the scoreboard for the visitors remains quarterback Justin Thomas, the 2014 all-ACC second-team quarterback. He ranked fourth in the ACC in rushing last year with 1,086 yards and eight touchdowns, and produced 1,719 yards and 18 touchdowns (on just 187 attempts.) “Terrific player. Everything goes through him. He’s very dynamic as both a runner and thrower. Great competitor, tremendous speed, makes good decisions. You can’t say enough good things about him.” Clemson lost last year’s matchup 28-6, but it wasn’t on account of the defense, as the Yellow Jackets scored twice on interception returns. Georgia Tech actually finished with its season low in total yardage against the Tigers with 353 yards in the Nov. 15 victory. “They’ll have a tweak here and there, a couple of change-ups,” Johnson said. “But they’ve pretty much been the same (under Venables.)” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:43:25.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
