I like it.\"\nHeld over 21 stages from May 6-29, next year's race totals 3383km and features six mountaintop or uphill finishes.\nAfter the opening time trial of 9.8km in Apeldoorn and two further, flat stages in the Netherlands that favour the sprinters, the peloton transfers to the 'sole' of the Italian peninsula where hostilities resume on stage four at Catanzaro, considered a 'medium-mountain' stage.\nThe peloton will then race up through the middle of Italy over a mix of flat and hilly terrain before reaching the Dolomites mountains in the north east of the country.\nOn the way, the contenders for the race's famous pink jersey could be brought to fire their first salvoes on stage six, which finishes an uphill finish at Roccaraso after a final climb of 18.75km.\nSpain's two-time and defending champion Alberto Contador , who is not expected to put his title on the line next year in what is his final season before retirement, said: \"It's not a crucial stage but days like this can't be ignored because they always give an indication of your rivals' condition.\"\nTwo days later, on stage eight, the race's second time trial, held over 40.4km in the Chianti region, could shake up the overall standings even further.\nThe first foray into the high mountains comes on stage 14 when the peloton races over 210km from Alpago to Corvara (Alta Badia) - one of three stages on the race given a five-star difficulty rating by organisers.\nIt should provide an ample warm-up for the next day's challenge. The final time trial, held over 10.8km, is uphill from Castelrotto to Alpe di Siusi and features a manageable but challenging gradient of 8.3 %.\nA further three days will be spent in the high mountains, on stages 16, 19 and 20, taking in trips across the border to neighbouring France which hosts the summit finish of stage 19 in Risoul and the start of stage 20 in Guillestre.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:41:03.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
