Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow KENNESAW — Kennesaw State’s triple-option offense has produced big numbers in the running game.That continued to be evident Saturday in the Owls’ 56-17 win over Point on Saturday. They scored their final five touchdowns on the ground and carried the 58 times for 403 yards.Kennesaw State (4-1) entered the game with 1,317 rushing yards on 218 attempts — a 6.0-yard-per-carry average — and 15 touchdowns. While the running game had produced for the Owls on a weekly basis, their passing attack is proving to be just as formidable.On Saturday, Kennesaw State scored its first three touchdowns through the air and ended the game completing 12 of 17 passes for 308 yards. The Owls nearly doubled their passing total for the season, having entered the game with 398 passing yards.“I wasn’t surprised, but I was excited,” Kennesaw State coach Brian Bohannon said of his team’s success through the air. “We know we have talented receivers who do a great job catching the football. We threw for 300 yards. It doesn’t get much better than that for a running football team.“We played to the strength of our team. Not every game is going to be like that, so a lot of credit goes to our offensive coordinator, coach (Grant) Chesnut, and the staff. There were some things we knew going in that we worked on. We know (the passing game is) an asset and we have to use it.”Kennesaw State used it well.Trey White completed touchdown passes of 43 yards to Darnell Holland, 69 yards to Chaston Bennett and 19 yards to Justin Sumpter as the Owls built a 21-0 lead midway through the second quarter.Kennesaw State’s play-action off the triple-offense set the tone for air attack. By the end of the first quarter, the Owls were 5-of-6 for 111 yards, and four of the five completions generated first downs. By halftime, they were 8-of-10 for 208 yards, with six of the eight completions producing first downs.When the game was over, Kennesaw State averaged 25.7 yards per completion, and 10 passes led to first downs.“We’re built with play-action in mind,” Bohannon said. “It’s down the field. We want to give our receivers a chance to make a play and to get first downs. When we do that, it makes it tough on defenses. We’re going to have to use everything to make ourselves successful.”Bennett came into the game with one reception for 14 yards, but he had two catches for 90 yards and a score against Point. Holland previously had one catch was for 9 yards, but he grabbed three passes for 84 yards and a touchdown Saturday.“It feels good to contribute,” said Bennett, who also ran for two touchdowns. “We see these plays in practice and execute them in the game. My role is still the same. It’s just better execution. Every week, I feel myself getting better. I just need to follow my rules and make plays. It’s about matchups and, if I can beat my man with speed, then we can make a play.”White finished the day 9-of-14 for 239 yards and three touchdowns. Reserve Jake McKenzie was 3-of-3 for 69 yards.“My job is to get the ball in the hands of our best athletes, depending on the looks we’re given,” White said. “We just executed on the plays we worked on. It’s great to see them work out in a game. I’m not surprised we scored through the air. We work on that.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:24:32.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
