(AP) â€” A second University of South Florida football player has been suspended from team activities for allegedly firing a gun on campus.\nUniversity police arrested junior cornerback Lamar Robbins on Thursday. He remained in the Hillsborough County Jail early Friday with an $8,000 bond.\nPolice say they arrested Robbins after an investigation into the Oct. 11 arrest of freshman reserve offensive lineman Benjamin Knox. Arrest reports say Knox fired a gun at a dorm on the campus near Tampa.\nKnox was suspended from all team activities earlier this week. The athletic department released a statement Friday saying Robbins had also been suspended.\n\"They will remain so as we continue to gather more information through the proper authorities,\" the statement said. \"We cannot state strongly enough our commitment to the values of our institution and that any behavior inconsistent with those will not be tolerated.\"\nUniversity police said a statement that they spoke with Robbins early in the investigation and he gave false information.\nRobbins is charged with discharging a weapon on campus, a second-degree felony, and giving false information to a law enforcement officer.\nA lawyer for Robbins isn't listed on jail records.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:29:27.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
