Wilkins told reporters he was “no MKG,” but he did provide a late spark in Saturday’s 97-93 preseason victory over the New York Knicks. Playing with a group that included veterans Tyler Hansbrough and Elliot Williams and rookies Aaron Harrison and Frank Kaminsky, Wilkins scored three of the Hornets last four points after New York had closed within 93-90. “The thing that stands out is he’s been around,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said of Wilkins, who has nine years and 563 games of NBA experience but hasn’t been in the league since 2013. “A guy like him gives you a chance to execute.” Wilkins has yet to be involved in a full practice with the team – that’ll happen Sunday – but will need to impress Hornets management quickly as they decide on a final roster spot. Clifford admitted Saturday night that a decision on a 15 th player may well come down to the undrafted Harrison or veterans Williams and Wilkins. On a night when both teams substituted liberally and the Knicks sat out probable starters Carmelo Anthony, Jose Calderon and Robin Lopez, neither team led by six in a contest in which Charlotte improved to 5-0 on the preseason. “In terms of approach, we were similar,” Clifford said of he and Knicks’ head coach Derek Fisher. “They were coming off a back-to-back and we were coming off a long trip.” Clifford started Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum at guards, Marvin Williams and Cody Zeller at forwards and Al Jefferson at center, but none of them played more than 16 minutes overall – and none played in the second half. Jefferson led a balanced attack in which 13 of the 15 who played scored points with 12 points. Kaminsky added 11 and Walker and Jeremy Lamb 10 apiece in Charlotte’s first game since playing twice in China in the past week. Reserve Cleanthony Early had a game-high 17 points for New York (4-1), which lost its first preseason game of the season. Charlotte notched its fifth preseason victory for only the fifth time in Charlotte’s NBA history; The Hornets went 5-3 in 1990, 2001 and 2013. Charlotte will go for a sixth preseason win in its last home preseason game on Monday at 7 p.m. against the Chicago Bulls.
