Both Blatter and Platini deny wrongdoing.\nPending the outcome of the FIFA investigation, the two soccer officials could be handed longer bans.\nPlatini received 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) from FIFA in 2011 which, he says, was unpaid additional salary from his job as Blatter's adviser between 1998 and 2002.\nPlatini has not produced a written contract to show the money was owed to him. Because of his ban from any role in soccer, Platini is not allowed to attend Thursday's meeting.\nExecutive committee member Allan Hansen, who is also a member of the FIFA audit and compliance committee, said earlier this week he could no longer support Platini if there was no written contract.\n\"I expect to get some further information because I didn't so far,\" Hansen said as he arrived at Geneva airport on Thursday.\nFIFA investigators have not yet been convinced there was even an oral agreement between Platini and Blatter which accounts for the unpaid debt called in at the start of 2011. Platini said he did not receive his full salary by 2002 because FIFA could not afford to pay him.\nBesides the FIFA probe, the payment is also being investigated by the Swiss attorney general.\nPlatini still hopes he can clear his name in time to stand in the FIFA presidential election in February, even though he is expected to be declared ineligible once the candidate integrity checks are conducted after Oct. 26.\nOnly Platini and Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan have said they have submitted their paperwork to FIFA ahead of the deadline for candidates.\n___\nAP Sports Writer James Ellingworth in Moscow contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
