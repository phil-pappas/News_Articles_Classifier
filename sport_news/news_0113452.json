Third-place Malmo reached three points by defeating pointless Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0 at home.\n“I think we created more chances than PSG, we controlled the match against a difficult team,” Madrid coach Rafa Benitez said.\nPSG had ball possession but just nine attempts at goal compared to Madrid’s 16. In the absence of the injured Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez, Benitez had to field a largely reshuffled team.\nManchester United 1 CSKA Moscow 1\nAnthony Martial gave away an early penalty and then scored the equalizer as Manchester United came back to draw CSKA Moscow. United’s struggles in Europe continued on a cold night in Russia, with Louis van Gaal’s men lacking creativity for much of the game despite enjoying twice as much possession as the hosts.\nWolfsburg’s 2-0 win over PSV Eindhoven in the night’s other group game leaves the German team atop Group B with six points at the halfway point of the group stage, two points ahead of United and CSKA.\nAtletico Madrid 4 Astana 0\nSaul Niguez, Jackson Martinez and substitute Oliver Torres scored a goal each as Atletico Madrid easily defeated Astana 4-0 to take the group lead with six points from three matches. Atletico’s other goal came when Astana defender Denys Dedechko turned the ball into his own net just before the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon Stadium.\nBenfica, which lost 2-1 at Galatasaray, also has six points but trails the Spanish club on goal difference in Group C. Galatasaray reached four points with its first victory.\nLukas Podolski scored a first-half winner for Galatasaray after Benfica had opened the scoring through midfielder Nicolas Gaitan in the second minute and Selcuk Inan levelled the game from the penalty spot in the 19th.\nJuventus 0 Borussia Moenchengladbach 0\nLast season’s finalist Juventus remained atop the group despite a dull home draw with Borussia Moenchengladbach. Apart from a dangerous free kick from Paul Pogba early in the second half that ’Gladbach goalkeeper Yan Sommer pushed away, there were few chances for either side in Turin.\nJuventus has seven points in Group D, one more than Manchester City, which rallied to beat Sevilla 2-1.\nIn Manchester, Kevin De Bruyne scored an injury-time winner as City continued its recovery in the group. Playing as a lone striker in the final minutes, the Belgium playmaker collected a pass from Yaya Toure, cut inside and drove a low left-footed shot inside the far post in the first of four minutes of stoppage time.\n“We had the character to try to win the game until the end,” City coach Manuel Pellegrini said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:15:48.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
