Chief Minister Harish Rawat made a series of announcements for the welfare of police personnel at a function held on Police Commemoration Day here today. He said cycle allowance had been doubled and a police welfare fund, with an initial corpus of Rs 1 crore, would be created. Earlier, he laid a wreath at the memorial at the Police Lines and observed a two-minute silence in the memory of policemen who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. The Chief Minister said vigilance sub-centres would be set up at Almora, Tehri, Pauri, and Pithoragarh. As many as 28 new police stations were being set up in the state and efforts were being made to ensure that one woman sub inspector (SI) was employed at each centre, he added. He praises personnel of security agencies for effectively performing their duties. The Chief Minister said the government was committed to the welfare of policemen and their families. He said policemen and other security agencies had done a commendable work during the 2013 flash floods in the state. “Even during the Char Dham Yatra, police personnel worked round the clock to assist the pilgrims,” he added. Despite a huge crowd of Lord Shiva devotees during the Kanwar yatra recently, there was no disruption of traffic on the highways. He asked police personnel to remain prepared for the forthcoming Ardh Kumbh mela. He said it was a matter of pride that state policemen were deployed on borders with China and Nepal. The Chief Minister urged the public to recognise the services of police personnel. October 21 is observed as Police Commemoration Day in memory of CRPF personnel who died fighting Chinese invaders in Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir in 1959. Home Minister Preetam Singh, Forest Minster Dinesh Agarwal, MLAs Ganesh Joshi and Raj Kumar, Principal Secretary (Home) Umakant Panwar and SSP Dehradun Sadanand Datte attended the function.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:06:10.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
