As if they needed added incentive, there's this nugget to keep in mind: Of the 75 teams to fall behind 0-2 in a best-of-seven series in major league history, just 13 (17%) rallied to win the series.\nThat doesn't bode well for Toronto, which is already down 0-2 against Kansas City in the ALCS, and it's a daunting prospect for Chicago against the Mets in the NLCS. It also adds to the weight of history that the Cubs carried into this series—the franchise has not won a pennant since 1945, more than a decade before any of the other teams remaining in this year’s postseason even came into existence—and makes Game 2 an especially critical contest for Chicago. Fortunately for the Cubs, they'll have the right man on the mound.
