After losing to the Lady Bearcats earlier in the season 8-5, head coach Neal Bailey said after the game that both teams hit the ball during the first meeting. The only difference, he said, is that Pilot Grove’s hits were right at the Cairo players. In the game on Wednesday, the Lady Tigers out-hit Cairo 8-5 and never let their foot off the pedal while scoring at least one run in four out of the six innings of play for a 8-3 victory. Pilot Grove, who improved to 15-11 on the season, will now advance to the quarterfinal round of the state tournament on Saturday at Canton starting at 2 p.m. Canton defeated Atlanta on Wednesday by a score of 3-0. Bailey said this is what every coach wants at end of the season to be playing their best softball. “Our goal is to just come out and play,”Bailey said. “The girls are having fun and if we are up by just one run at the end of the game, that’s ok. I knew it was going to be another close game but I didn’t think it would be a high scoring game. We put up a few more runs than what I expected but I figured if we got them at home and play some defense and Mel is on, I figured we could hold them down.” Bailey was right on all fronts. Although both teams finished the game with two errors, only one led to a run for Cairo. As for the Lady Bearcats, they had two errors and both proved costly as Pilot Grove scored a total of four runs-three in the first and one in the third. As for the pitching, freshman Melanie Wolfe went head to head with the CAC’s MVP in Allison Keen. While losing to the Lady Bearcats earlier in the season at Cairo, Wolfe looked to be the better of the two pitches on Wednesday by giving up only three runs on five hits and five walks. She also struck out five batters to pick up the complete-game victory and improve to 8-7 overall. As for Keen, she also went the distance and struck out 10 batters while giving up eight runs on six hits and five walks. Bailey said Wolfe had a couple of little hiccups but worked through them against Cairo. “We figured if we could keep her walks down we were in pretty good shape,” Bailey said. The Lady Tigers also had a brief hiccup in the top-half of the first as Cairo put up one run on one walk and a throwing error to second on a steal attempt. Page 2 of 3 - However that all evened itself out in the bottom-half of the inning after the Lady Tigers rallied back with three runs on two hits, two walks and a throwing error to lead Cairo 3-1. The throwing error proved costly as it enabled Pilot Grove to scoring the tying run at 1-1. The Lady Tigers later followed that up with a single to right by Wolfe, a walk by Marissa Day and another RBI-single to right by Samarah Bailey to extend the lead to 3-1. Pilot Grove never trailed after that while adding another run in the third on singles by Wolfe and Bailey and a ground out by Day to make it 4-1. The lights were definitely dimming on Cairo after that literally. With the Lady Bearcats coming to bat in the top-half of the fourth, the lights went out on three poles to delay the game for approximately 15 minutes. Of course it seemed to bother Cairo more than it did the Lady Tigers, who tacked on another run in the fifth on a fly out to deep second by Day to score Reagan Walker from third. The Lady Bearcats didn’t go down without a fight, though. In the sixth, Cairo got one of the runs back on a walk and a RBI-single to right by Brynn Winkler to cut the lead to three at 5-2. But it was all for not as Pilot Grove answered with three runs in the bottom-half of the inning on an infield single by Schupp and a two-RBI double to right-center by Walker to push the lead back up to six at 8-2. Bailey said it was nice to score extra three runs because Cairo had the top-half of the order coming up. “I knew they weren’t going to go away,”Bailey said. “It was obviously big, though, to score the three runs in the sixth because once you get toward the end of the game you never know. I also knew after their 7, 8 and 9 hitters they had the top of the order coming up in the seventh so Iwanted to do everything we could to get a run or two.” Luckily for Pilot Grove, it didn’t come to that although Cairo did manage to come up with one run in the seventh on doubles by Courtney Botkins and Marley Winkler. However, after loading the bases with two outs and trailing 8-3, Wolfe got the out she was looking for by inducing a fly out to left to end the ballgame. As for the hitting in the game for Pilot Grove, Reagan Walker went 2-for-4 with a single, double and two RBIs. Melanie Wolfe also had two hits with a single and a double while Emily Schupp and Samarah Bailey added one single and one RBI each and Marissa Day with two runs batted in.
