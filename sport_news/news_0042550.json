He tied for bronze behind Jamaican superstar Usain Bolt and American Justin Gatlin at the world track and field championships in August.\nDe Grasse was offered a seven-figure shoe deal after his NCAA performances but the sprinter announced shortly after his world bronze that he would complete his senior season with the USC Trojans.\nHe is currently in final negotiations with a shoe company, according to the source.\nDe Grasse became just the third Canadian to break the 10-second barrier in the 100 metres behind Donovan Bailey and Bruny Surin. (Ben Johnson ran sub-10 as well but the convicted doper's times were erased from the record books).\nDe Grasse also broke the Canadian record in the 200 metres.\nThe news comes a few days after Trayvon Bromell, the American who tied De Grasse for world bronze in Beijing, announced he was going pro. Bromell, who's also 20, decided to forgo his last two seasons of eligibility to sign with Bolt's agent Ricky Simms. He also signed an endorsement deal with New Balance.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Our choice is clear -- Stephen Harper\n0\nTCHC oversight of long-term disability lacking\n0\nFantino calls for criminal probe of Liberal co-chair\n0\nBlue Jays vs. Royals: 15 things to know\n0\nOntario hydro rates rising Nov. 1\n0\nRichard Nixon predicted Justin Trudeau would be future PM\n0\nLockdown lifted at Wilfrid Laurier University after online threat\n0\nDonald Trump's top campaign expense: Hats and T-shirts\n0\nMayor Tory responds to Kansas City mayor's ALCS bet\n0\nMercedes designs car-themed luxury apartments\n0\nAndrea Christidis remembered\nJays get ready for Game 5\nGame 5 will be The Stroman Show\nNorth Korean Yeonmi Park's View of Canadian Freedoms\nPredictions for the Jays in ALDS\nMore from Other Sports Sprinter Andre de Grasse going pro 0\nOscar Pistorius to be released from jail, moved to house arrest 0\nIndia's Dhoni silences critics 0\nLuge talent Kim McRae gets extra training kick 0\nFloyd Mayweather's luxury cars go up in flames 0\nInside Toronto sun.com Entertainment\nKardashians pause social media postings 0", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:57:07.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
