CSKA also have four points, while PSV Eindhoven are a point further back.\nSchneiderlin acknowledged that United had to be more creative in possession and said that while they were disappointed not to get the win it was more important not to come away from Moscow with nothing.\n\"We could have played a bit more direct sometimes, but we know that we can improve because we need to create a bit more,\" the midfielder said.\n\"It's a bit of mixed feelings. With the game we wanted to take the three points but in the Champions League it is a marathon, not just about one game,\" he added.\n\"It is difficult because we wanted to come here to win, but the most important thing was to not leave here without any points.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:46:27.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
