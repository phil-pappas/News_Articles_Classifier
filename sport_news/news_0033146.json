(AP Photo/Gail Burton) more > By TOM WITHERS - Associated Press - Monday, October 12, 2015 \nCLEVELAND (AP) - Browns star cornerback Joe Haden will likely miss one game with a concussion sustained during Sunday’s overtime win at Baltimore. \nHaden, who was already playing with a broken right ring finger, got hurt when he came up to stop a screen pass on the first play of the fourth quarter. Browns coach Mike Pettine said Monday that Haden has been placed in the NFL’s concussion protocol. \nHaden sat out last week’s game with the broken finger, but received injections and played with a padded glove against the Ravens. \nAlso, Browns quarterback Josh McCown said he will continue to receive treatment on his left ankle, which he rolled late in Sunday’s 33-30 overtime victory. McCown passed for 457 yards - a franchise regular-season game record. He’s hoping to be able to play this week when the Browns host the Denver Broncos. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:05:05.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
