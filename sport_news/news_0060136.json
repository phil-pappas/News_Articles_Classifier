The roster now stands at 17 players. The Nets have until Monday to cut two more men to get down to the required 15. Brooklyn opens its regular season against Chicago on Oct. 28 at Barclays Center.\nOf the training camp invitees, only guard Dahntay Jones and forward Justin Harper remain on the roster. Both are candidates to be cut — although Harper has been impressive this preseason, scoring 10 points in 17 minutes during Sunday’s win over Philadelphia, when coach Lionel Hollins said he wanted a look at the regular-season rotation.\nCenter Willie Reed had thumb surgery last week, which will keep him out for 6-8 weeks, giving the Nets a major depth problem with their bigs — a problem that has been exacerbated by Andrea Bargnani’s notoriously unreliable health. The 7-footer missed the entire preseason with a hamstring injury.\nIf the Nets decide to keep Reed, and play the opening weeks short-handed on the frontline, the team will owe him nearly $1 million in guaranteed money. The Nets won’t have to pay Reed if they cut him before the season starts. \nDonald Sloan, who the Nets signed in August, seems to have solidified his spot as the third point guard with Boatright gone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:40:01.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
