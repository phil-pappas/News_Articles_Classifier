Marcus Mariota Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota warms up before an NFL football game against the Indianapolis Colts Sunday, Sept. 27, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Zaleski) (Mark Zaleski) Comments \nOrchard Park, N.Y. â€” The Buffalo Bills are going to have a coast-to-coast reach for their Week 5 game against the Tennessee Titans. \nThe television coverage map shows the game obviously will air in Buffalo (and New England) and Tennessee. But it's also the early CBS game for Oregon and small parts of Washington and California. \nThe reason? Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota. \nMariota is the biggest star Hawaii has ever placed in the NFL, and those who live there have been able to watch every one of his games, including the preseason. \nHe also starred at Oregon, so it makes sense that he's on television in that market as well. It is interesting to note that the Bills game on CBS will be up against the Seattle Seahawks game on FOX at the same time on Sunday in Oregon. \nThis may be the most unique television coverage map the Bills will have all season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:57:10.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
