There are four races left for me to get this championship tied up and as long as it's done by the time I cross the line in Abu Dhabi that's what really counts. \n\"I'm excited to get out there, give my best and if I can come away with a third Stetson hat that would be unbelievable.\" \nHamilton's Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg is all but out of the championship title fight after he retired at the last race in Russia. \nIndeed if Hamilton outscores him by two points he will have little more than pride to play for in the remaining three grands prix after Sunday's round in America. \nRosberg said: \"With four races left and a big gap to Lewis, it's clear that the title is a long shot for me now. \n\"But it's not in me to give up or back down, so I'll be pushing flat out to the end and hopefully having some fun out there in the final few rounds this year. \n\"I really want to enjoy the next races, as our Silver Arrow is such a great car and gives me the chance to end the year with a few more wins. \n\"Austin is definitely somewhere that you can have fun too, so I'm looking forward to going back there. It's a great track to drive, I got pole there last year, and I'm coming off the back of a really strong weekend in Russia in terms of my performance, so if I can repeat all of that then I'll be in a good position.
