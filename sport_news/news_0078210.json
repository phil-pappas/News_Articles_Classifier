Mayo jumps toward the basket against Cleveland's Dionte Christmas (33) in the second half on Tuesday night in Cleveland. Tony Dejak/Associated Press Oct 13, 2015 at 10:11p ET 0Shares \nCLEVELAND -- LeBron James and Cleveland's other four projected starters sat out as the Cavaliers dropped to 0-4 in the exhibition season with a 110-101 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night. \nGreg Monroe and rookie Rashad Vaughn scored 19 apiece for the Bucks, who trailed by three going into the fourth quarter. Monroe had 13 rebounds and John Henson added 16 points and 10 boards for Milwaukee, which is expected to build off a surprising run to the playoffs last season. \nJames was given the night off by coach David Blatt as the Cavs played their second game in two nights. Center Timofey Mozgov also got a break and the defending Eastern Conference champions remain without Kyrie Irving (knee), Kevin Love (shoulder) and J.R. Smith (hamstring). \nJames came to Quicken Loans Arena, but the four-time MVP didn't feel well and was sent home. \nMo Williams scored 18 on 4-of-15 shooting and Richard Jefferson had 16 for Cleveland. \nBUCKS: Forward Damien Inglis made his first start and finished with two points in eight minutes. Inglis missed last season after undergoing two surgeries on a broken ankle. ... O.J. Mayo had 12 points and 10 assists. ... Swing man Giannis Antetokounmpo didn't play. \nCAVALIERS: Jared Cunningham , making a strong push to make Cleveland's roster, shot just 1 of 12 and scored six. ... Cleveland had just one turnover in the first half. \nTOO LONG: Blatt would like to see the exhibition season shortened to a \"maximum\" five games to give players more rest. \"I think that would be good for the game,\" Blatt said. \"I know that it would be good for the players and I also think it would be good for the fans.\" \nBucks coach Jason Kidd is also in favor of a shorter preseason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:34:15.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
