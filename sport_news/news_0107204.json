(Bill Haber/AP) \nJoe Vitt was an undersized linebacker at Towson University before becoming a football coach, so he knows something about toughness. Now an assistant with the Saints, Vitt is displaying more of it, after suffering a pair of major injuries while trying to foil a crime in progress. \nThe 61-year-old tore an Achilles’ tendon and broke a wrist while chasing car thieves early Saturday morning outside his home in Metairie, La. Vitt went to a hospital but reportedly has not missed any work — setting quite an example for his players. \nThe New Orleans Advocate has more details: \nVitt was at his home about 3:50 a.m. Saturday when he saw a shadow moving across his front lawn, said Col. John Fortunato, a spokesman for the Sheriff’s Office. The 61-year-old coach stepped outside to investigate and saw a blonde woman wearing gloves about to enter his neighbor’s unlocked car. \nVitt then looked at his own car — which was unlocked as well — and noticed a man was inside it, Fortunato said. The man and woman began running away when they noticed Vitt, and the coach pursued them until he fell to the ground injured. \nIf Vitt’s name sounds familiar, it may be because he served as the Saints’ interim head coach for 10 games in 2012 , while head coach Sean Payton was serving his season-long “BountyGate” suspension. Vitt himself had to sit out the team’s first six games for his alleged role in the scheme to reward New Orleans players for deliberately injuring opponents. \nVitt led the Saints to a 5-5 record during that span, before returning to his role as an assistant to Payton. Vitt also served as interim head coach for the Rams in 2005, compiling a 4-7 record while Mike Martz dealt with a heart illness. Des writes for the Early Lead and the D.C.
