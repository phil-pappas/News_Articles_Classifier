Potentially his last real mistake as a Blue Jays pitcher. \nA mistake that belies the inner-rules of baseball. \nIf you’re a left-handed pitcher, the old story goes, never throw a changeup to a left-handed hitter. Price threw a changeup to Mike Moustakas in the second inning, and Moustakas pounded the ball — in somewhat controversial fashion — over the right-field fence. \nThe Jays challenged the home run, believing a fan in the right field seats touched the ball early. The challenge was lost by the Jays: The home run stood. \nAnd after the home run that made it 2-0 Kansas City in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, Price settled down and pitched beautifully. \nOver the next 4⅔ innings Price allowed just two hits and struck out eight Royals batters. \nTHIS AND THAT \nLost opportunities: Ben Revere, who has had a rough series at the plate, led off with Game 6 with a double just inside the first base line. But the Blue Jays stranded their fastest starter, with Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion going quickly and quietly to end the first inning ... The Jays led off the fifth innings with back-to-back walks to Russell Martin and Kevin Pillar. Ryan Goins tried to bunt them over, but wound up flying out. Revere hit an opposite-field line drive that looked like it might be trouble. It was caught. Then Donaldson scolded a low liner that third baseman Moustakas made a terrific stab on. Had the ball got past Moustakas, the game would have been tied 2-2 with Bautista coming to the plate ... Through six innings, the Jays were 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position. Neither team was able to put two consecutive hits together through six ... Revere made a terrific leaping catch that saved an extra-base hit and probably a run in the seventh. Ryan Goins followed that up with a sharp stop at second. Jays ... Strikeouts hurt the Jays in the post-season: They struck out 51 times in the ALCS heading to the seventh inning of Game 6; K.C. struck out 34 times ... With two outs in the seventh and Moustakas on second base, Price was taken out in favour of Aaron Sanchez, brought in to face Alex Rios. Rios singled to left field with Moustakas scoring, making the score 3-1 K.C. \nSCENE AND HEARD \nRoyals starter Yordano Ventura breezed through the first three innings. After giving up the double to Revere, he retired 10 in a row ... Price was hoping for a clean inning to start the game under so much intensity and pressure. But he wound up giving up a first-inning home run to his former teammate and good friend, Ben Zobrist. The Jays middle infielders, Troy Tulowitzki and Goins, both made strong plays preventing infield hits ... The controversial second-inning home run by Moustakas, which might have been interferred with by a fan, was the first playoff homer from the third baseman ... Even when Price was pitching well, he wasn’t getting any breaks. In the third inning, he forced Lorenzo Cain into dribbling one by the mound, with backspin coming off Cain’s swing. Cain wound up with an infield single on maybe the lightest hit ball of the night ... After giving up the two early home runs, Price settled down, striking out six of the next 11 batters ... Pitching coach Dave Eiland came out to visit starter Ventura, after he walked the first two batters to start the fifth inning. The Royals got Luke Hochevar up in the bullpen after Ventura’s first real difficulty in the game ... Manager Ned Yost had a quick hook for Ventura, removing him in the sixth inning for Kelvin Herrera. Herrera stuck out the first batter he faced, Chris Colabello and then got Tulowitzki to fly out to centre field ... Ventura only gave up four hits in 5⅓ innings pitched but the Royals figured it was time ... Kansas City did not have more than one hit in any inning after the first six innings ... Near collision on a foul popup by Kendry Morales in the sixth. Russell Martin made the catch, basically entangled with Donaldson. \nK.C. AND THE HOME RUN BAND \n“Toronto uses home runs as their weapon, we don’t,” Kansas City manager Yost said. “We’re not the team that lives and dies with the power. We put the ball in play and try to make things happen ... We bunch together some hits and it looks really, really nice. And we’ve won some games because of it.” \nThe fact: Kansas City hit seven home runs in six games. The Blue Jays have hit five. \nSTROMAN ON PRICE \nMarcus Stroman is like a sponge. He picks up a little bit of everything, throughout the clubhouse. While Stroman takes all kinds of instruction on pitching and life from the likely retiring Mark Buehrle, he has been so impressed with Price over the time they’ve been Blue Jays together. \n“He’s the most genuine, humble, down to earth person you could ever possibly meet,” Stroman said. “He loves and cares for every single one of his teammates. I can’t put into words how crucial he is to our clubhouse, how crucial he is to our camaraderie. He’s the glue that gets everyone going. He’s the man behind it all. I just consider myself lucky to be one of his teammates and call him a friend.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:45:20.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
