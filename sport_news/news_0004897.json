Both boards would dissolve before the November election, meaning that the merger would need to be approved by Oct. 31. \nThe Allegheny Intermediate Unit would take over school board duties and oversee the merger until a new board is elected in April. \nThe plan was met with backlash from some community members, including incoming school board members like James Bogotay, who say they believe Baker’s plan is a ploy to prevent them from taking their seats in December. \nThe five newcomers have been vocally opposed to several of the current school board’s decisions, including the Moon elementary school reconfiguration and closing of Hyde Elementary School. \n“The issue today is not about how Moon Township residents see Cornell residents,” Bogotay said. “This has nothing to do with the kids, sadly. It’s 100 percent political.” \nBut some Cornell School District parents, like Beth Haus, of Neville Island, said they could overlook politics in favor of opportunities for their children. \nHaus, whose two sons attend school in the district, said if a merger could be agreed upon in two weeks, she would welcome it. \n“I have no concern whatsoever for self-serving politics,” she said. “All the children deserve the same kind of education that this merger would allow for.” \nThe discussion divided Moon’s school board as well, with board member Dennis Harbaugh acknowledging the benefits of a merger, but admitting that the three-week time frame would be “absurd.” \n“When I see an opportunity to help kids, it does hit me,” Harbaugh said. \nBoard member Gia Tatone, who wrote a book about the history of Coraopolis, argued in favor of hearing community input, citing historical examples of mergers between the two districts being revisited over the decades. \nBoard member Michael Hauser said he is not opposed to the merger that would benefit the children, but is more comfortable revisiting the topic once the new board is seated. \nIncoming school board members Bogotay and Mark Scappe say they agree with Hauser. \nScappe, a Cornell High School graduate who served on Moon’s school board when the districts considered merging in 1998, said he remembers the crucial planning and extensive community feedback involved. \nThe districts must consider teachers union organization, state funding, integrating curricula, sports and transportation among other things, Scappe said. \n“That was 16 years ago, and it didn’t work out that time,” he said. “However times change, things change and I have no opposition to revisiting it.“", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:31:12.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
