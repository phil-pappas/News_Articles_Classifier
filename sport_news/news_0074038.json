After a scoreless overtime, which saw chances at both ends and a B’s power play, the Caps scored on the first two shots of the shootout ( T.J. Oshie , Evgeni Kuznetsov ), while Ryan Spooner and David Krejci were stopped, giving the home team the 2-1 win.\nThe Bruins’ lone goal was by Loui Eriksson, set up at the goalmouth by Patrice Bergeron in the first period.\nRask didn’t see a ton of shots, but most were high-quality bids, including at least four clean breakaways, a couple of 2-on-1s and several more chances by Caps attackers alone at the net-front.\n“It really felt like there were no easy shots,” Rask said. “There were a lot of scoring chances. Obviously we made a lot of uncharacteristic things out there, giving up those breakaways especially. But it was fine. I felt great. I felt calm and I was reading the play and seeing the puck very well.”\nBackup plan\nThe backup battle, primarily involved Smith, Jonas Gustavsson , Malcolm Subban and Zach McIntyre . The former two were the last two standing.\nRask said he was confident that whomever is selected as his No. 2 would do the job and provide him more rest than last season when he played a career-high 70 games.\n“All the goalies who were in camp were doing a great job,” said Rask. “So I think we’re in great shape in that category. Obviously I’m trying to focus on my own job and doing that the best I can. Whenever I get rest I’m sure the guy who backs up will do a great job.\n“The thing you have to look at is that you’re hoping (as a team) to still be playing in mid-June. If the workload ends up being 90-100 games by the end of it, you’re pretty well exhausted. So you try to maintain that rest the best that you can. What the magic number (for games played) is, nobody knows.”\nPut up your fists\nFighting may be dying in the NHL, but you wouldn’t know it last night as the clubs had four big-time bouts: The B’s Tyler Randell prevailed in a tiff with Liam O’Brien in the first. Randell is the most unexpected name remaining on the roster, and has impressed with his effort and grit.\nThen Kevan Miller was on the wrong side of a bout with tough winger Tom Wilson . Wilson caught Miller with an right upper-cut that sent his helmet flying and likely will turn up in fighting video packages.\nIn the third, a pair of bouts came seconds apart. Adam McQuaid bested Oshie, and Miller got revenge, pummeling Wilson 15 seconds later.\n“It was good,” said Miller of the rough stuff. “It’s contagious. We like each other in here, we don’t want to see anyone get hurt. We stand up for each other.”\nRoster near set\nThe Bruins have, for now, just one skater and one goalie to cut. As of yesterday there remained 27 players on the roster, including the injured Zdeno Chara , Dennis Seidenberg and Seth Griffiths .\nAssuming Chara will play in Game 1, and with Gustavsson or Smith gone, that leaves one cut to be made. The scratches last night were Max Talbot and defenseman Zach Trotman.\nBackstrom out\nThe Capitals will open the season minus their top all-round player, center Nicklas Backstrom . The classy Swede underwent hip surgery in May.\nHe has been skating with the team and looked good at yesterday’s morning skate, but is expected to miss up to the first 10 games of the season.\n“From Day 1, we’ve been looking at maybe 10 games as the worst-case scenario and we’ll work from there,” he said. “Hopefully that team period will lessen.”\nFormer Boston College star Brooks Orpik , no favorite of Bruins fans after his cheap shot on Eriksson two seasons ago, is still out after offseason wrist surgery. He likely will be ready for the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:00:45.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
