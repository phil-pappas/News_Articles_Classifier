Their chief strategist Kenneth Esloyo was named ‘Coach of the Year’ in the Evo division. \nJaygard Vios added 11 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals, while Ryan Paul Abordonado finished 10 points, three rebounds and three assists for Telstra, which used a relentless offensive in the final half to turn the tables on Supportsave. \nIt was indeed a sorry loss for the Dragons as they got off to a blistering 24-16 start. The Dragons even padded their lead to 10 points at halftime, 39-29. \nThe Boomerangs, however, charged back with finesse in the third period, launching a 30-19 blitz to wrest the driver’s seat, 59-58, for good going into the last 10-minute mark of the contest. \nTelstra then fought steadier in the windup to walk away with a seven-point victor.   \nGermaine Jo Guarisma scattered 23 points laced with six rebounds, four assists and three steals, but Nino Belande was held off to only 14 points, 12 rebounds and three assists in a losing effort for Supportsave .— EBV (FREEMAN)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:11:13.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
