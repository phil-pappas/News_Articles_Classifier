Then you throw in that it's (Clayton) Kershaw, (Zack) Greinke twice each, (Jon) Lester, (Jake) Arrieta, I mean that's impressive.\n\"He's about as locked in as I've seen a hitter, and he's carried that out now for seven games. That's quite a feat, especially in the playoffs against this pitching.\"\nCubs catcher Miguel Montero said Murphy was a good hitter on a roll.\n\"He's always been a tough guy to strike out, he puts the ball in play,\" Montero said. \"When you put the ball in play a lot of good things can happen. Obviously his comfort level is really high. Good for him, not as good for us.\n\"He looks like the best hitter in the planet right now.\"\n(Editing by John O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:13:40.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
