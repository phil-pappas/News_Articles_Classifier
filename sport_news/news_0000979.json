Maybe not with championships or conference titles, but with one of the nation’s most exciting offenses comprised of some of the nation’s most electric athletes. Tavon Austin immediately comes to mind. The No. 8 pick by the St. Louis Rams in the 2013 NFL Draft will always be regarded as one of the greatest receivers in WVU history, and for good reason. Austin’s records speak for themselves: all-time leader in receptions (288), receiving yards (3,413), kickoff return yards (2,407) and all-purpose yards (7,286). His all-purpose yard total leads all other Mountaineers by nearly 1,500 yards. He also ranks second in career touchdown receptions with 29, a record he concedes only to the other half of his dynamic duo, Stedman Bailey. Bailey, who also plays pro ball in St. Louis, recorded 41 career touchdowns, including 25 in one season, which ranks third-best all time behind Troy Edwards’ 27 at Louisiana Tech and Randy Moss’ 26 at Marshall. His 3,218 reception yards rank only behind Austin for a career. After their departure, Holgorsen found a gem out of Lackawanna College in Scranton, Pennsylvania in Kevin White, who was also selected in the top 10 of the NFL Draft just two years after Austin. Although White only played in Morgantown for two seasons, he found himself in the top 10 in WVU for both receiving yards, receptions and touchdowns with 1,954, 144 and 15, respectively. West Virginia fans and Holgorsen have not had the luxury of one of the nation’s top wide-outs this season, but that’s not a trend anyone involved in the program feels will last much longer. The Mountaineers feature two very young, impressive receivers on the outside in redshirt sophomore Shelton Gibson and true freshman Jovon Durante. Gibson has emerged as a huge possibility for WVU’s next superstar. Through six games, he’s recorded 540 reception yards and six touchdowns. He also has averaged 23.5 yards a catch, tied for third-best in the FBS. \"We have a bunch of first-year receivers or second-year receivers that we are going to be talking about for a long time,\" Holgorsen said. \"How quick we can get there, I don’t know. I know (Gibson) is getting really close for us. He’s getting really close.\" Gibson has also emerged as a return threat for WVU. Since he’s begun getting reps, he’s returned nine kicks for 272 yards, including a 100-yard touchdown against Baylor, for an average of 30.2 yards a return; good enough for ninth-best in the NCAA. A surprising candidate comes in the form of David Sills, a quarterback who ranks low on the depth chart and has put coaches on notice with his play on the scout team. Sills has been groomed to be a quarterback ever since he was offered a scholarship to USC when he was 13 years old, but has found his way onto the field using a different set of skills. \"He started playing receiver for (defensive coordinator Tony Gibson) because we don’t have enough bodies to play receiver on the scout team,\" Holgorsen said. \"He turned some people’s heads down there, so I took him last week and had a talk with him. We practiced, and he looked pretty good. I asked him if he wanted to go play ball, and he said that he wants to do anything he can to help the team.\" Against Baylor, Sills caught two passes for 64 yards, including a 35-yard touchdown pass from Skyler Howard. It appears the Mountaineers could have the national recognition they’ve become familiar with in their receiving corps very soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:43:58.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
