They’ve lost five straight. Signs of improvement are hard to find each week. \nDarrell Hazell is in the middle of his third season. He’s lost 26 of 31 games and posted a 1-18 record against Big Ten teams. Three of Hazell’s five victories are against FCS teams and Purdue has dropped 12 straight to FBS programs. \nThat didn’t stop university officials from announcing $60 million worth of upgrades to the Mollenkopf Athletic Center on Wednesday. The project is pending approval by the board of trustees at its December meeting, but president Mitch Daniels, board president Michael Berghoff and athletic director Morgan Burke were involved in the announcement. \nAsked to access where the program is, Daniels responded: “It’s not in a good place. I can tell you all the reasons that we absolutely should have one, probably two more wins, if not more but 1-6 is 1-6. I’m at every game, so I know what’s been going on.” \nThis project and Hazell’s status as the head coach are unrelated, Burke said. Hazell has been an active participant in what the project should include to improve the roster and eventually lead to better performances. \n“This is something that is needed for the roster, the development of this squad. I wouldn’t mix the two issues,\" Burke said. \"There’s a lot of emotion in the air right now about the lack of success; we understand that. We’re trying to take a measured approach to deal with a particular deficiency that we think can be advantageous to this program into the future. \n“Darrell is the guy right now who’s running the ship. He and his staff have an experienced pedigree. They’ve been through some tough sledding before.” Artist renderings show what the improved Purdue Football Performance Complex is expected to look like.
