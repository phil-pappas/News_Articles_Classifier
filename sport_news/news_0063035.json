(Bob Dungo Jr.)\nWith the kind of talent they have, it’s no surprise that the Tamaraws have won eight of their first nine games in the tournament, and could still be undefeated had it not for the heroics of Ed Daquioag in their first round loss to the University of Santo Tomas Growling Tigers.\nThe remaining five games may look like a mere formality for FEU to assert itself as title favorite, especially with Mac Belo, Mike Tolomia and Roger Pogoy playing what many say is almost at the level of the PBA.\nThough the next assignments may appear easy, complacency could cost the Tamaraws dearly.\nTheir victories were not really dominating and in some instances, they barely survived games against Adamson, defending champion National University and University of the Philippines, three teams hardly considered in the same level as FEU.\nRacela, however, knows what’s ahead and that is to tell his players not to think ahead.\n“We’re not thinking about it (the semis) yet. One game at a time,” he said yesterday.\n“Still we’re looking for improvements. The last few days, we talked about how we can improve day to day and find consistency,” Racela said after FEU’s 68-57 win over UP on Wednesday.\nThough the scoreline may look comfortable the game was far from easy for FEU as UP hung tough for three quarters before Racela said his team “finally decided to play”.\n“The reason why there’s frustration is because as a coach, alam namin yung level na kaya nilang laruin. And then we see them play in this (low) level lang,” Racela said.\n“Kung tingin ko na di nila kaya yun, then di ako ma-frustrate kasi alam ko sinasagad nila yung ginagawa nila and I think now they understand na kaya ganyan ako kasi I want to push them.”\nThe final five games will be interesting for the Tams as Racela will find out whether his veterans can finally play on a level that is expected of them.\n“Now we have that space. Napaaga kami ng konti. Siguro the challenge for us is that teams are adjusting now and kailangan namin iangat yung level namin.”\nFEU will face La Salle, University of the East, Adamson, UST and NU in the next five games.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:41:01.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
