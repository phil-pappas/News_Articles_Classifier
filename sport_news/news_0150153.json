(AP Photo) \nHouston Texans cornerback Kareem Jackson gave a little scouting report on Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones on CBS Sports Radio's \"The Doug Gottlieb Show\" last week. \n\"We know he's pretty good,\" Jackson said in advance of the Texans' game in Atlanta on Sunday. \nJackson didn't need to watch film to know that. He and Jones were teammates for two seasons at Alabama , including on the Crimson Tide's 2009 BCS national championship team, before becoming first-round picks in the NFL Draft â€“ Jackson in 2010 and Jones in 2011. \nJackson and Houston's other starting cornerback, Johnathan Joseph, will be the Texans' first line of defense against the NFL's leading receiver on Sunday. \n\"He's definitely putting up some major numbers right now,\" Jackson said . \"A guy like that, man, you've got to do some different things to try to contain him. Our coaches have definitely prepared a great game plan for us, and you know me and the other cornerback, Johnathan Joseph, we're definitely going in there to execute that game plan. So for us, we've got to try to contain him and, like I said, do some different things to switch it up on him and, hopefully, we can be successful on Sunday.\" \nThrough the first three weeks of the season, Jones has 34 receptions and 440 receiving yards. He's the first Atlanta player to start a season with three straight 100-yard receiving games and the first player in NFL history with at least 135 receiving yards in each of his team's first three games in a season. Jones' 34 receptions are the most an NFL player has had three games into a season. \nRELATED: JULIO JONES RECEIVES NFL AWARD AFTER RECORD-SETTING MONTH \nDespite that showing, Jones said he could improve. \n\"I feel like I can do better,\" Jones told reporters last week. \"You can never play a perfect game. There's some calls I haven't executed properly in the first three games. I have to execute better. I feel like I'm capable of doing anything and everything. I just got to come to work every day. The main thing is staying healthy.\" \nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE \nJones missed Wednesday's practice again last week, with a toe ailment added to his sore hamstring. Those injuries won't prevent him from playing on Sunday. \n\"In my experience just being around him every day, it's the competitor that sets him apart,\" Atlanta's first-year coach Dan Quinn said . \"I mean it's the physical skills, too, but there's that and then the added part of the competitor. You know, like this rare world-class talent where the other half of it is this rare world-class competitor. I think you're putting both of those two things together, and it makes a pretty unique guy.\" \nThe Texans and Falcons kick off at noon CDT Sunday in the Georgia Dome. Alabama's CBS affiliates are scheduled to broadcast the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T17:19:09.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
