They ran all the way to the World Series, racking up 14 total stolen bases — 10 more than any other team.\nSpeed is one of their obvious strengths and a major part of their offence.\nThe Blue Jays , meanwhile, were the AL’s best team at controlling the running game, boasting the league’s best throwing catcher in Russell Martin and also a staff of pitchers skilled in holding runners. No AL team allowed fewer stolen bases against.\nSo it should make for an interesting cat-and-mouse game within the games in this ALCS.\n“It’ll be huge,” Jays’ manager John Gibbons said of controlling the running game against the Royals. “That’s a big part of what they do.”\nBut despite being the best power-hitting team in baseball, the Jays are themselves also among the top base-running clubs. They may not swipe as many bags as the Royals’ speedsters, but they led the majors this season with a 79 per cent stolen-base success rate (Kansas City ranked fourth at 75 per cent) and finished second — behind the Texas Rangers — in Baserunning Runs, a comprehensive statistic that accounts not only for stolen bases, but also how well teams take extra bases (such as going first to third or second to home on a single) and how well they avoid making outs on the bases.\nThe Royals, meanwhile, are middle of the pack in that regard.\nTim Leiper, the Jays’ first-base coach, is in charge of base-running for the team.\n“I’m extremely risk averse,” he told the Star recently. “It makes no sense to make outs on the bases with the offence that we have.”\nBut being selectively aggressive can open up another offensive avenue when the opposing pitcher is keeping their hitters at bay, he said. “Being aggressive intelligently and being aggressive by just taking chances are two different things. I think there’s a lot of information that allows us to be aggressive in certain situations.”\nLeiper keeps tabs on the pitcher’s speed to the plate and the catcher’s throw time to second, but also where the outfielders are positioned, the strength of their respective arms and the hitters’ tendencies as well. When a Jays runner gets to first, Leiper whispers that info in their ears.\n“We have the benefit, too, where we have a lot of big hitters in our lineup so a lot of outfields play deep on us,” he said. “But if you’re not aware of it, maybe you won’t do it. The one thing about going first-to-third, it has to be in your mind before the ball’s even hit. That’s the main thing: to plant that seed, know where guys are playing, know where certain guys are going to hit the ball and if the ball goes through this area, let’s make sure we get there. So before the ball’s even hit, there’s already the pre-thought that we’re going to get there.”\nKevin Pillar and Ben Revere, who this season stole 25 and 31 bases, respectively, rank second and third in the majors in terms of Baserunning Runs. But not too far behind are Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista, two players you wouldn’t necessarily think of as base-running threats.\n“They’re winning players,” Leiper said, “and they realize how important that part of the game is to winning.”\nDonaldson, who led the majors in runs scored this year, stole just six bases, but was never thrown out. He and Bautista both excel at going first-to-third and second-to-home on singles, while Donaldson’s aggressive dashes to the plate and acrobatic slides regularly made the highlight reel this season.\n“We’re going to slug our way through a lot of games,” Leiper said. “But at the same time there’s going to be a lot one-and-two-run games — especially at this time of year — where base-running is going to be extremely important.”\nMore on thestar.com\nJoe Buck can’t win, with either Jays or Royals fans: Mudhar\nBreaking down home runs during first round of MLB playoffs", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:14:43.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
