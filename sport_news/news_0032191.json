But Utley is appealing the suspension and will be eligible to play until he has a hearing with MLB.\nUtley released a statement through his agent, Joel Wolfe, Monday afternoon.\n\"The Players Association and my agent are handling the appeals process,\" Utley said. \"I have nothing more to say other than to reiterate that I feel terrible about Ruben's injury. Now my teammates and I are focused on Game 3 and doing everything we can to win this series.\"\nBefore word of Utley's suspension Sunday, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said it was \"definitely a possibility\" that he would have Utley in the starting lineup for Game 3. Utley is 6 for 18 with a double and a home run in his career off the Mets' Game 3 starter Matt Harvey.\nMets manager Terry Collins acknowledged he was a little surprised Utley was not starting given his history against Harvey and the Mets. Collins suggested Utley might still be feeling the effects of Saturday's collision with Tejada.\n\"Don knows his team better than me. But I got the same stats he's got and I know he (Utley) swings the bat pretty good against Matt Harvey,\" Collins said. \"After I saw the replay several times of the play at second, he's lucky he didn't get hurt because he took a pretty good shot. So maybe that's an effect, too. Something may be stiff or whatever.\n\"But I know ... he has a knack of beating us somehow. So let him sit over on the bench for eight innings.\"\nMattingly confirmed Sunday that Utley was checked for a concussion after Game 2 but he was deemed \"fine.\"\nTonight's lineups:\nDODGERS (1-1) \n2B Howie Kendrick\nSS Jimmy Rollins\n1B Adrian Gonzalez\n3B Justin Turner\nRF Andre Ethier\nLF Carl Crawford\nC Yasmani Grandal\nCF Kike' Hernandez\nLHP Brett Anderson\nMETS (1-1) \nRF Curtis Granderson\n3B David Wright\n2B Daniel Murphy\nLF Yoenis Cespedes\n1B Lucas Duda\nC Travis d'Arnaud\nSS Wilmer Flores\nCF Juan Lagares\nRHP Matt Harvey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:31:59.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
