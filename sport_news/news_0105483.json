Ten years ago, the annual USC-Notre Dame game exceeded it.\nIn what became known as the “Bush Push Game,” the top-ranked Trojans – riding a 27-game winning streak and coming off consecutive national championships under Pete Carroll – visited the ninth-ranked Fighting Irish. Notre Dame had dropped each of the previous three meetings by 31 points. But under brash first-year coach Charlie Weis, the Irish had visions of an upset, and were in position to pull it off.\nWhat happened next is the stuff of legend. The Register reached out to several players, coaches and broadcasters who were at Notre Dame Stadium on Oct. 15, 2005, to retell the story of that game. One of the main characters, star running back Reggie Bush, declined to participate, but his thoughts from immediately after the game are included.\nTHE ATMOSPHERE\nEvery USC-Notre Dame game is a big deal; this one was bigger. There were tens of thousands of people on campus who couldn’t get tickets for the game but were content just to be in the vicinity .\nNotre Dame tight end Anthony Fasano, currently with the Tennessee Titans: “It was probably the best football atmosphere I’ve ever been a part of. Just the buildup. Marquee players on both sides. Big pep rally the night before. We grew the grass long; it was a mental advantage, I guess. And really every play mattered in that game. It came down to the last one.”\nUSC tailback LenDale White: “It was electric. There were so many things going on. I remember seeing Joe Montana. It was such a big game, and we didn’t want to lose it. There were so many people outside, shaking the buses and whatnot.”\nTHE FINAL SERIES\nIn a game featuring three ties and five lead changes, Notre Dame seized the advantage on quarterback Brady Quinn’s 5-yard touchdown run with 2:04 remaining. USC took possession at its 25 with two timeouts facing a 31-28 deficit. After an incomplete pass and a second-down sack, the Trojans faced third-and-19 .\nPete Arbogast, USC radio broadcaster: “The play before the Dwayne Jarrett catch, Paul (McDonald, Arbogast’s broadcaster partner) is describing how we need to get 8 or 9 yards on this next play. I’m not thinking that. I’m thinking, what am I going to say when we lose? How am I going to present this?”\nUSC defensive end Frostee Rucker, currently with the Arizona Cardinals: “What stands out about the last series the most is that we didn’t quit. I may sound cliché, but we fought on.”\nUSC backup quarterback Mark Sanchez, currently with the Philadelphia Eagles: “It was just a great effort by everybody – the coaches, the players. Really just fighting it out and playing until the last whistle. I just remember how much we worked on those situations. Those last-second thriller plays have been rehearsed so many times. When we got into the game, with all that external pressure, the guys on the field didn’t seem to feel it. They just took exactly what we did on the practice field and executed really well.”\nBush, currently with the San Francisco 49ers, from that night: “I'm not going to lie. There probably were some guys who thought it was over. But we kept fighting.”\nFOURTH-AND-9\nUSC gained 10 yards on a pass from quarterback Matt Leinart to Jarrett. The Trojans called their final timeout with 1:32 left. On fourth-and-9, Leinart audibled and connected with Jarrett, who had missed time in the second half with vision problems caused by a third-quarter dive for a catch, for 61 yards to the Notre Dame 13 .\n1 2 3 Next Page VIDEO: USC-Notre Dame, Oct. 15, 2005 Related: Lev: 'Trojan War' takes USC fans back to happier times From 2005: USC pushed to the brink, edges Notre Dame From 2005: Dwayne Jarrett saw one ball he needed From 2005: Miller: Close isn't enough for Irish", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/9mWU2U_ukUc", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/leinart-94907-usc-trojans.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/usc-687272-film-simmons.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/jarrett-94834-usc-ball.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/plays-94934-usc-win.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:32:19.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
