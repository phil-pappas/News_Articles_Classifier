The score was set up by a 49-yard pass from Shawndarrius Phillips to Corey Gammage on the first play from scrimmage.\nAtlantic scored on each of its next three possessions. Dontavius Monroe made it 14-0 with a 3-yard touchdown run and Phillips gave the Eagles a 20-0 lead on a 34-yard run.\nJerrod Ferguson's 8-yard touchdown run stretched Atlantic's lead to 26-0 four minutes into the second quarter. George Hunter intercepted a Owen Levine pass on the final play of the first half and returned it 75 yards for a touchdown to give Atlantic a 33-0 lead at halftime.\nSpanish River scored its only touchdown on the fourth play of the second half when Levine connected with Dimitrius Hirsch on a 58-yard scoring pass, but Atlantic answered with a 74-yard touchdown run by Jerrod Ferguson and a 36-yard scoring run by Monroe to give the Eagles a 46-7 lead midway through the third quarter and ititiate a running clock for the remainder of the game.\nAtlantic had 380 yards total offense, 238 yards coming on the ground. The Eagles' defense limited Spanish River only 32 yards rushing and 110 yards passing.\nDespite the lopsided score, Atlantic coach T. J. Jackson said his team has plenty of room for improvement heading into the second half of the season, particularly with penalties. The Eagles were flagged for 115 yards in penalties.\n\"We've got to get rid of the flags. Way too many penalties,\" Jackson said. \"We've still got to work on getting the right personnel on the field in certain situations and definitely work on our passing game.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560df44c/turbine/fl-spanish-river-atlantic-recap-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:41:30.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
