Posted: Tuesday, October 6, 2015 7:57 pm St. Anthony edges Teutopolis, both advance to sectionals Ryan Czachorski Daily News Effingham Daily News \nSt. Anthony was pushed by county foe Teutopolis, but the Bulldogs bested the Wooden Shoes to win the Class 1A Robinson Regional. \nThe Bulldogs shot a 329 and edged out Teutopolis' 334, while Robinson grabbed the third spot at sectionals with a 358. Altamont finished fourth with a score of 366. \nIt was a close round at the top for the Bulldogs and the Wooden Shoes. \n\"It was a little bit tighter, Teutopolis' boys played really, really well,\" said St. Anthony coach Phil Zaccari. \"It was a little shaky at the end there.\" \nJared Hutchison carded a 78 for St. Anthony, and Niko Dust shot an 80 for the second-lowest and third-lowest rounds of the day behind Robinson's Tom Goodman, who shot a 76 for the medal. Jeff Niebrugge shot an 85 for eighth, and Luke Ludwig finished 12th with an 86. \nFor Teutopolis, Christian Deters tied for fourth with an 81 and Dylan Buenker shot an 82 for sixth. Keegan Meyer came in with an 85 for eighth and Mat Weber tied Ludwig for 12th with an 86. The Shoes thought they could compete with St. Anthony after finishing nine strokes back at the Windsor Invitational. \n\"We just about had them, our goal was to show up and compete today, and we definitely did that,\" said Teutopolis coach Lewis Martin. \"These past few weeks, we've been playing pretty good golf. \n\"Christian, Dylan, my one and two guys, we expected some good scores out of those two. They could have had a little better of a day today. Mat, I was really happy with, I think that's one of his lower finishes. We kept griding today and never gave up.\" \nMartin said that this was the second time the Teutopolis boys have finished in the top three and made sectionals, th other being in 2013 with a third-place finish. \nWhile Altamont came up just short, the Indians will send two to sectionals. Adam Mayhaus and Dylan Miller both shot 89s for the sixth and seventh individual slots. \nFor the other Indians' scores, Cameron Jackman shot a 93 and Grant Schmidt shot a 95. Coach John Niebrugge was happy with his advancing individuals, but thought the third spot was something they could have achieved coming in. \n\"We knew St. Anthony was there and T-Town, we assumed they might be a one-two; I thought that third spot was kind of open,\" Niebrugge said. \"Losing by eight shots, the boys were a little disappointed as a team. \n\"I know Dylan and Adam were pretty happy, that's the bittersweet part about golf, it's team and individual. Adam would probably tell you straight face he didn't shoot his best, he's happy to move on as an individual, but on the team front, he wishes could have carried the weight on his shoulders a little more.\" \nThe Bulldogs, the Shoes, and Mayhaus and Miller will move on to Monday's Class 1A Anna-Jonesboro Sectional at Union County Country Club. \nIt's the 10th-straight regional crown for St. Anthony, and Zaccari thinks they could cut a few shots off going forward. \n\"Jared had one bad hole, but other than that, played flawless. Niko was solid all round,\" he said. \"I think we can do better all around, Jeff and Luke could have shaved three or four strokes off their round, but I'm pretty happy with it.\" \nRESULTS \n1.
