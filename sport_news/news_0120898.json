More >> SELMA, AL (WSFA) - \nAdministrators are setting the record straight at Concordia College after a miscommunication led to upset students on the Selma campus. \nVice President of Business and Fiscal Affairs Dexter Jackson says a misunderstanding resulted in members of the student body believing all of the college's athletics programs were cancelled Wednesday, causing much concern. \nJackson stresses that it is \"business as usual\" for athletics and that no sports have been cut. \nThe college believes a correspondence between top officials was taken the wrong way regarding some away games. \nDr. Tilahun Mendedo, the president, and the athletic department were looking at canceling upcoming travel for teams due to financial constraints since budgets for some of the teams are low. \nThe president emailed the Vice President of Student Affairs about possibly eliminating travel. Officials say the VP of Student Affairs took it to mean that athletics were cancelled altogether since there wasn't enough money, and he email all of the coaches who then emailed all of their players. \nThe college tried to clarify the matter with students after a church service Wednesday morning but word still spread around campus. \nStudent athletes say they're relieved to hear that their programs are not being cancelled and that they can continue to play the sports they love. \nConcordia College's president said that at the end of year, the college will review all of its athletic programs as they do every year to determine if it is financially feasible to continue them for 2016-17. \nThe college relies solely on tuition and donors. Officials say Concordia would never cancel all of its athletic programs, but they will re-evaluate each one and do what is financially best for the institution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:57:23.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
