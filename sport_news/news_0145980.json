Allen and Bostic were outside linebackers in the Bears’ new 3-4 scheme, the one position on the team with depth. Sam Acho will man Allen’s spot, while Pernell McPhee has already been the team’s best defender on the other side. Lamarr Houston and Willie Young will be relied upon more than before, however. Now is the time to find out if those two are worthy of a playing-time boost, or directions to the door like their friends. QB Cutler sounds ready to return When quarterback Jay Cutler went down with a strained hamstring in the team’s Week 2 loss to Arizona, the floor fell out from under the offense with Jimmy Clausen under center. They were shut out for the first time since 2002 last weekend. Now Cutler sounds like he could be ready to return for this weekend’s home game against the Raiders after practicing in a limited fashion Wednesday and Thursday. After answering “Maybe” when asked if he could play if the Bears had a game today, he said “We’ll see” about Sunday. “We’ve still got a couple of days left. I don’t think we’re exactly where we want to be, but no one really is 100 percent healthy right now,” he added. Banged-up Bears in need of boost With WR Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) also returning to practice this week, the offense could be in for quite a shot in the arm if it gets its QB and its big-play wideout back. Punter Pat O’Donnell (knee), on the other hand, has not practiced, and the Bears may have to sign a free-agent for a game or two. Quote of the Week QB Jay Cutler, joking about media reports on his timeline for return: “When it happened I heard it was two weeks. …Am I playing this week or not? What’s the report now? I think Alshon’s playing and I’m not? I’m out, right? So I’m out?” Stat of the Week The Seahawks had 178 total return yards last weekend on the Bears. Chicago had 161 yards of total offense.
