(AP) - The state is replacing the parking lot and ramp at the Union Bay boating access site at Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. \nThe Department of Natural Resources says the ramp is being closed for the project, which is expected to extend into next spring. Dave Merk, park supervisor, says the ramp is being widened and deepened for improved access. Parking is being expanded. \nThe project is expected to be completed by June. The boat launch is located in the northeast corner of the 59,000-acre park. \nUnion Bay is a popular destination for boaters, anglers and campers. \nDuring construction, the Big Iron boating access site can be used as an alternative boating access site for Lake Superior and Union Bay. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:48:23.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
