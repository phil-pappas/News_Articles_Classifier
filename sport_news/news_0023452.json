Seven other members of the RKS also boycotted the meeting as the Medical Superintendent of the DRPGMC had not provided them copies of the agenda of the meeting. The governing body of RKS was scheduled to meet at 2.30 pm at the Tanda hospital, but the agenda was not distributed among the members and even Transport Minister GS Bali too was not provided a copy of the agenda till 2 pm by Medical Superintendent KK Katoch. GS Bali said he was sitting with Health Minister Kaul Singh Thakur during a programme of anaesthetics at Tanda when the Health Minister was provided with a copy of the agenda at 11.30 am and he (Bali) was ignored. Bali said he had remained in the medical college till 2 pm and when he did not get a copy of the agenda there was no point in attending the meeting as he had no formal communication. Bali said it was unfortunate that the Medical Superintendent did not take the meeting seriously and asked Health Minister Kaul Singh Thakur to take this issue seriously and take an appropriate action. Seven members of the RKS â€” Suman Verma, Parveen Saini, Kamla Sharma, Kuldeep Narayan, Abey Chand, Dr Rajeev and Rajesh Kumar, boycotted the meeting as they too were not provided with the agenda. Health Minister Kaul Singh Thakur told this correspondent that it was a serious lapse on the part of the Medical Superintendent and he had tendered an apology in the RKS meeting. Expressing serious concern, the Health Minister directed that a copy of agenda should be provided to every member at least three days before the meeting. Meanwhile, the RKS meeting approved an estimated receipt of Rs 20.55 crore and an estimated expenditure of Rs 21.34 crore for the current financial year. The Health Minister said regarding a recent scam he directed the Medical Superintendent to register a case of cheating and misappropriation of government funds with the police which was delayed by more than 10 days. Referring to a delay in starting the super speciality hospital, the Health Minister said following his meetings with Union Health Minister JP Nadda, HLL Compnay was directed to provide equipment worth Rs 33 crore by March 31, 2016. He said the delay was on the part of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:08:27.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
