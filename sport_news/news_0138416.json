So they certainly want to make the most of that and make an impression on everyone involved.” \nAdded pressure or not, Sullivan said the team is looking forward to hitting the ice tonight. \n“We’re excited to play an opponent other than ourselves,” he said. “I think we’ve had four hard days here. Productive days. \n“Now, it’s an opportunity for everyone to show what they can do. I think it will be great feedback for the coaches as far as what we’re trying to implement from a systems standpoint, whether or not we’re having success.” \nNapkin talk \nHere’s a look at the lines for tonight’s game: \nForwards: Tom Kostopoulos-Sahir Gill-Ty Loney; Riley Brace-Jarrett Burton-Adam Krause; Cody Wydo-Christophe Lalancette-Derek Army and Pat McGrath-Shane Bakker-John McCarron \nDefensemen: Mathew Malone-Harris Ruopp; Nick Petrecki-Ryan Parent and Brett Stern-Clark Seymour \nGoaltenders: Brian Foster and Casey DeSmith \nNot playing: Carter Rowney, Paul Cianfrini and Michael Beauregard \nRowney has been battling an undisclosed injury, so his absence is likely precautionary. \nFoster is expected to play the first two periods, with DeSmith taking over for the third. \nLoney, who is skating on the top line with Gill and Kostopoulos, will be someone to keep an eye on. He is the son of former NHL player, Troy Loney, who won two Stanley Cups with the Penguins. \nThe 23-year old signed with the Penguins organization after playing four seasons at the University of Denver, where he totaled 39 goals, 50 assists and 128 penalty minutes in 152 games. \nLoney, who is one of eight players in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on an AHL contract, made his professional debut last year when he signed with the Norfolk Admirals and recorded a goal and two assists in his professional debut on April 7 at Binghamton. \nHe finished with four points (2G-2A) in five appearances for the Admirals.
