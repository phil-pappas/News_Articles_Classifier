Whistles, obstruction, just very little happening. \nSo what did the coaches tell the Rangers between the second and third periods? \n“They didn’t come in,” Henrik Lundqvist said. “The message within the group was to believe in what we do here.” \nRick Nash said it was also about how important it was for the Rangers to get the victory. \n“The one thing we were explaining to each other is how important these two points were,” Nash said. “You think you’re going against a team that’s not in your division, not in your conference, it’s October, and we just tried to put emphasis on how important these two points were and we needed them.” \nWell, they got them, the hard way, in what turned out to be a 4-1 win at the Garden. \nKevin Hayes got a gift goal, when Arizona goalie Mike Smith’s pass hit J.T. Miller’s skate and ended up in front of an empty net, Keith Yandle scored a power-play goal against his old team, his first of the season, and Nash was credited with an empty netter when he was fouled from behind on a breakaway, his first goal of the season and 700th career point. \n“It was a little bit emotional,” Yandle said about facing his former team for the first time. “But after the first couple of shifts, it was game time and it was a fun game to play in.” \nEarlier, Mats Zuccarello – the Rangers’ best forward through eight games – made a perfect lead pass and Chris Kreider, at full speed, made a lunging redirection past Smith to tie the game in the middle of the second for his first of the season. \nAnd Lundqvist, who allowed a short-side goal on the second shot he faced in the first period, played a solid final 40-plus minutes, even making another of his spectacular “silly” saves this season, diving to rob ex-Ranger Anthony Duclair after giving away the puck to Max Domi. \nBefore a crowd that included Lundqvist’s buddy Matt Harvey, making a pit-stop on his way to the World Series, the Rangers came back from 1-0 down to hand the Coyotes their first road loss of the season. \nIt was the second win in a row for the 5-2-1 Rangers, who visit Philadelphia Saturday and are home against Calgary Sunday. \n“I didn’t even go in between the second and third,” Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said. “The guys knew what they had to do on the ice. And in the third they executed a little bit better and capitalized … we were able to get two points that are important.” \n“I think we picked up our game after out (first) goal and we started playing a faster game and we created more chances,” Lundqvist said. “That 1-1 game in the third, you don’t want to give them anything. You just let your skill and patience be the deciding factor.” \nWith the game winding down, Nash had a breakaway and was hooked from behind, so while the puck never went in, he had broken through, finally. \nAsked if he envisioned his first goal coming that way, Nash laughed. “The way things were going, yeah.” \nTwitter: @RangersReport 1 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1S00gsD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:25:31.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
