After that first weekend shock loss against Japan we had to stand up and be counted.” \nWith eight players remaining in the squad from 2007, there is experience of winning the Webb Ellis trophy, but Habana feels that counts for little. \n“2007 was great and it is always nice to reminisce about the past, but the past isn’t going to get us anywhere in this competition,\" he said. \n“As a group we have learnt quite a few lessons over the last three weeks and we can use those lessons to the best of our ability going into this knockout phase where you have eight of the best teams in the world competing for that little cup called Bill.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:12:22.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
