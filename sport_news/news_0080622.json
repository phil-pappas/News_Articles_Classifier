Then, the Huskies picked up speed. Battle Mountain scored 40 unanswered points in the first half en route to a dominating 54-6 victory over Aspen at Husky Stadium in Edwards. The Skiers avoided the shutout when Jesse Lopez scored on a 3-yard run in the closing seconds of the Western Slope League game. The Skiers played their second game under interim head coach Chris Peshek. Former head coach Ryan Triece resigned earlier this week. Trice had been suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct in Aspen’s game two weeks ago against Roaring Fork. Battle Mountain scored first Friday night. The Huskies drove 59 yards with Noah Shamus scoring on a 30-yard draw play. Shamus ran across for a two-point conversion and an 8-0 lead with 4:27 to play in the first quarter. Wyatt Harwood set up the score with a pair of long runs for the Huskies. Battle Mountain forced a safety on Aspen’s next possession when a Skiers’ shotgun snap sailed over the quarterback’s head and out of the end zone. The Huskies’ lead moved to 10-0 with 3:40 to play in the opening quarter. Harwood ran 48 yards for a Battle Mountain touchdown on the next possession. The Huskies led 17-0 after a Chase Keep conversion kick. Battle Mountain opened the second quarter with another scoring drive, including long runs from Harwood and Keep. Chance Archuleta picked up the touchdown on a 3-yard run. Keep’s conversion extended the lead to 24-0 with 9:18 to play in the second quarter. Quarterback Demetrius Parrish scored on a 1-yard sneak for the Huskies on their next possession. Keep’s kick put the Battle Mountain lead at 31-0 with 5:07 to play in the first half. But the Huskies weren’t finished with their first-half scoring. Battle Mountain scored again on a 31-yard field goal by Keep, giving the Huskies a 34-0 lead. The Battle Mountain defense stymied the Aspen offense in the first half. Of Aspen’s eight possessions in the opening half, five ended in punts. One ended in a safety. On one possession, the Skiers turned the ball over on downs. And on their eighth possession, the Skiers fumbled and Battle Mountain took over. Minutes later, Shamus scored on an 8-yard run to make it 40-0 — the halftime lead. Chance Archuleta opened the second half with an 89-yard touchdown run for the Huskies and a 47-0 Battle Mountain lead with Keep’s conversion kick. The Skiers fumbled on their next possession with the Huskies recovering. Archuleta ran 24 yards for his third Battle Mountain touchdown: 54-0. Battle Mountain improved to 3-3 overall, 2-1 in the Western Slope League, with the Friday night win. Aspen fell to 2-5 overall, 0-3 in conference play. The Skiers will play at Moffat County in Craig next weekend. Aspen will host Basalt on Oct. 30 in the final regular-season game.
