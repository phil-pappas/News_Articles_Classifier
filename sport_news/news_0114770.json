Roberts Stadium in Hattiesburg. The roster, comprised of current high school seniors, was announced Tuesday by Alvin Briggs, Director of the Alabama High School Athletic Directors & Coaches Association. The annual contest, an event of the AHSADCA and the Alabama High School Athletic Association, will be played in Mississippi for the first time. Head coach for Alabama is Thompson High School’s Mark Freeman. ead coac The annual all-star event has been played in Alabama since its inception in 1988. Alabama, 21-7 in the series, has won the last seven games with the last four being played at Montgomery’s Cramton Bowl. The game was played at Mobile’s Ladd-Peebles Stadium from 1988-2010 with the exception of 2007 – when two games were played in the series. The first, in June, was played at Mobile and the second game was played at Troy University in December. Since then, the game has been played in December. “The selection committee has worked extremely hard to once again put together an outstanding group of players,” Briggs said. “Several of the players have already committed to Division I schools and most will have a chance to play at that level after high school. We are excited about playing the game in Mississippi. We know, however, that Mississippi’s team is also very talented. Last year’s game came down to the final play. We are expecting another great game.” Among the players selected to the Alabama squad are two running backs already committed to SEC schools. Jarrion Street of Hewitt-Trussville, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound running back, has committed to Ole Miss and La’Mical Perine of Theodore, 5-11, 220 pounds, has committed to Florida. The Gators and Alabama each have three commitments on the squad. The Crimson Tide lists wide receiver T.J. Simmons of Clay-Chalkville, offensive lineman Deonte Brown of Austin and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams of Wenonah. The Gators also list Hoover defensive end Jeremiah Moon and Park Crossing defensive back Jeawon Taylor among their commitments. Also selected to the Alabama All-Star squad are Auburn commitments John Broussard of Central-Phenix City and Marlon Davidson of Greenville. Broussard, 6-1, 178, is a defensive back, and the 6-4, 270-pound Davidson is a defensive lineman. Other players chosen who have already made verbal commitments are Saraland wide receiver Velus Jones (Southern Cal), North Jackson tight end Austin Cummins (Louisville), Auburn offensive lineman Tyler Pritchett (North Carolina), Spanish Fort offensive lineman Jacob Johnson (Southern Miss), athlete Bailey McElwain of Hewitt-Trussville (Stanford), defensive lineman Darius Whitfield of St. Paul’s (South Carolina) and defensive end Erroll Thompson of Florence (Mississippi State). Among the top players still uncommitted are outside linebacker Ben Davis of Gordo and inside linebacker Lydell Wilson of Carver-Montgomery. Davis, the son of former University of Alabama standout Wayne Davis, is rated by most recruiting services as the No. 1 outside LB prospect in the South. Wilson is rated No. 1 inside LB. Quarterbacks chosen are Tyler Johnston of Spanish Fort and Tyrell Pigrome of Clay-Chalkville. The duo have three state titles between them. Johnston is being reunited with his former coach for this year’s game. The Toros won 5A titles in 2012 and 2013 when Freeman served as head coach. Clay-Chalkville won the 6A crown last season. Both teams, now in Class 6A, are still undefeated this season at 7-0. Alabama’s All-Stars won last year’s game 36-30 with the game-winning touchdown coming on the final play of the game. Alabama game MVP in 2014 was Kerryon Johnson of Madison Academy, now a freshman at Auburn. Among the recent MVPs have been two Alabama standouts, current Crimson Tide linebacker Rashaan Evans (2013) and current Jacksonville Jaguars running back T.J. Yeldon (2011).
