This year's baseball playoffs have delivered in a multitude of ways, chief among them the new blood that has risen to the top. Absent a real rooting interest, I'm into that. Give the long-abused fan bases something to cheer. Let their excitement ease another year without much here. The Yankees didn't score a run. The 100-win Cardinals won a single game. The Dodgers and Rangers — October semi-regulars, at least — lost division series that went the distance. We're left with four teams a collective 535 games under .500 in the regular season since baseball resumed in 1995. With two collective World Series wins since Ronald Reagan left office. Those championships were won by Toronto, who began the year sitting on an MLB-worst 20-plus year postseason drought. Four likable semifinalists, assuring a fresh, likable champion. Well, depending how you feel about New York. The Cubs can safely be called universally loved. (Outside of St. Louis, of course.) Yes, Joe Maddon can be a bit of an ordeal, and TBS positioning a dugout camera about a foot from his face isn't helping. People's passion for them, however, is raw and real. There are Red Sox ties everywhere: Jon Lester, David Ross, Theo Epstein, Manny Ramirez. And that parade of young sluggers? Imagine if Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo start hitting. Maybe there's some divisional resentment for the Blue Jays, a potential roadblock for years to come if their corporate ownership remains willing to spend. (The chase for David Price this winter should be a fun watch.) I love seeing the Rogers Centre full and rocking again, love seeing the super-slugging lineup the Red Sox were supposed to have and love that logo. (Yeah, I'm a weirdo.) The Royals feel a franchise really building something, if only they can afford it. They were 10th in attendance this year after years in the bottom 10; fans responding to success in a way, say, Tampa's never have. Payroll's already jumped for four straight years, and the roster's not getting any cheaper: Alex Gordon could opt for free agency this winter. Eric Hosmer, Lorenzo Cain and Mike Moustakas are all due arbitration raises next year. Yet that's a discussion for when these cardiac kids finally leave the field. Let's consider the other team standing, for whom the feelings are more mixed than I first imagined. In the same breath, I both understand why some view the Mets as underdogs and how that really can't ever be. Being the team staring up at the monolith as they were against L.A.? That was weird. The Mets were a top-six payroll team annually from 2000-2011. Their stadium, an underrated gem, cost $800 million — only cheap among their New York neighbors. They are, however, so clearly in another universe. The Red Sox of the past four years are those 12 Mets teams, which collectively spent about $1 billion to go 971-971 in the regular season and make just two playoff appearances. Even after three World Series titles here, though, the Mets are still the ancestors of 1986 to a lot of people. The chatter about Ron Darling replacing Jerry Remy showed that. We've not fully forgotten a team — above and beyond ripping New England's guts out — that was aptly feted in a Jeff Pearlman book called the “The Bad Guys Won.” “If you work on this (book) hard,” Pearlman quoted Bobby Ojeda telling him, “you're gonna find that we were a bunch of vile (expletives).” Watching the Mets flail and fail for most of 30 years was fun. And yet, I argue watching them succeed now is fun too. For one, it's a thumb in the eye to the Yankees, even better than the one the Cubs gave the Cardinals. It offers a reminder of the blueprint that allows bad teams to become good ones quickly. David Wright's been a quietly great face of a franchise. Yoenis Cespedes is the sort of alternatingly maddening and exhilarating player made for highlight reels. All that young pitching. All that Mr. Met. It's enough to make the New York-centric gushing about the whole thing tolerable. They're hardly my first choice, and probably my last. Having lived through 2004, just knowing from afar what would happen in Chicago supercedes everything else. Toronto's a beautiful city, even if closing that dome turns their stadium to a Tropicana-level dump. Kansas City's never out of a game, and plays with that fervor. There's no losers in this October Final Four, though. Especially if you just sit back and enjoy it for what it is: A cavalcade of young talent hopefully showing us the game we love is in pretty good hands.
