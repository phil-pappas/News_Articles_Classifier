The ministry, however, has said that there is zero chance of the competitions being held anywhere else but Brazil.

It is a real situation that can happen. I had a meeting yesterday and already discussed that possibility,” Giugni told Veja , following the opening on Wednesday of the International Indoor Showjumping Competition at Hípica Paulista in São Paulo. He said the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) had given the ministry until the end of the month to resolve the situation. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture denies the possibility of the riding events being held in any other country apart from Brazil and adds the FEI has not issued any formal statement imposing a deadline. Although it admitted to delays in the processing the paperwork, it said the relevant documentation for the safe movement of horses could be issued 120 days before the event. The documentation will also meet the required European Union approval. \nThe equestrian competitions are due to be held at the Deodoro complex where riding test events have already been held. Taking place in August, the competitions were deemed a success but only included Brazilian horses. Earlier in the year, an outbreak of glanders disease, a deadly contagious disease which affects horses’ lungs, led to one horse being put down and others to be relocated. Authorities insist the infection was handled well and poses no further threat to animals or humans.
