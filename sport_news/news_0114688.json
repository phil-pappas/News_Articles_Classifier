Petitioners asked the city to incorporate and rezone two additional parcels, which combined to add more than 26 net acres into the planned unit development; to rezone an existing section of land to provide for heavy commercial development and to add new development standards into the PUD that would allow for a mid-rise, four- to six-story multifamily development.\nAgent for the property owner, Jeff Halliburton of Thomas & Hutton, told council members this week his client was willing to hold the mid-rise complex at four stories, with the density tied to square footage per dwelling unit. The plan is to build 1,100-square-foot units in this development, Halliburton said, bringing the number of properties to fewer than 40 per acre.\nIn addition, Halliburton said, the petitioner has opted to abandon a request to rezone a parcel on the east side of Pooler Parkway from commercial to multifamily residential.\nWhen considered by the Pooler Planning Commission last week, city officials had reservations about the changes in zoning and standards. At the close of discussion, Pooler Planning Commissioners voted only to recommend incorporating the two new tracts. The requests to rezone and adopt new development standards did not get the planning commission’s support.\nBoard members at the time cited concerns about the effect this new development would have on nearby roads, schools and existing neighborhoods. Other concerns about the proposed apartment complex’s size, the proximity to nearby wetlands and traffic were registered by residents from the nearby Somersby community last week.\nThis week, some of these same residents attended to voice their opinions.\n“This is a fairly complicated proposal,” said Somersby resident Charlie Thornburgh. “We’re making some rather large changes. I’m not sure it’s to the advantage (of the city) in terms of traffic, in terms of utilities, in terms of schools and such.”\nBut City Councilman Stevie Wall said the request ultimately amounts to a redistribution of multifamily development in the PUD.\nThe council determined that the limiting the mid-rise development to four stories, especially when coupled with what Halliburton described as a 300-foot natural buffer, should shield that development from existing neighborhoods.\nIn unrelated business, the council voted to approve a proposed amendment to the development standards for the first phase of Savannah Quarters, subject to an agreement of the future repair of streets.\nThe city had tabled the issue last month to allow for Hal Kraft, the representative for the petitioner, to discuss the proposal with his client.\nThe planning commission on Sept. 14 voted to recommend denial of the change, which would have increased the amount of multifamily units by 35, from 754 to 789. City Manager Robbie Byrd said at the council’s last meeting that city staff concurred with the planning board’s recommendation because the community already has problems with on-street parking.\nByrd said he met with developers of the property last week and recommended the council approve the request, contingent upon an agreement being in place before the first permit is issued.\nIn other business:\n• Mayor Mike Lamb read a proclamation in recognition of the First Baptist Church of Pooler’s 130th anniversary.\n• The council approved requests to rezone 305 and 309 Carver St., from single-family to two-family residential to provide for construction of duplexes.\n• Council members accepted the maintenance bond and approved the final plat for phase 2 of Durham Park.\n• The council voted to release the two-year maintenance bond for the North Godley Industrial Park.\n• The council approved resolutions to provide lease supplements with the Georgia Municipal Association for the purchase of a new Chevrolet Tahoe for the city fire department and eight new Ford Explorers for the police department.\n• The council addressed concerns brought forth by Pooler resident and city council candidate Jeff Rayno about a recent notice of findings of coliform bacteria in the city’s water system.\nThe notice provided to city residents in their water bills this month said two samples collected in June “showed the presence of coliform bacteria,” violating the Environmental Protection Agency’s standards. Boiling water wasn’t necessary, the notice said, though it could have increased risk for residents with compromised immune systems, pregnant women, infants and the elderly.\nCity Manager Robbie Byrd said the notice was distributed to city residents in their water bills as soon as possible after it was delivered by the EPA.\nAccording to the notice, subsequent tests have not yielded any similar bacteria.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:27:47.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
