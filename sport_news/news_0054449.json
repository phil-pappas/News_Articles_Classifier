The nephew of 1984 Heisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie was 5 of 11 for 92 yards with a touchdown last week against Northern Illinois. \nNO BARNES: Duke WR Johnell Barnes won't play in the first half after his ejection for targeting in the second half against Georgia Tech. Barnes had a helmet-to-helmet hit on Georgia Tech PR Jamal Golden after he muffed a punt. Cutcliffe said \"I'm going to view it this way: We get a fresh Johnell barnes the second half of the game.\" \nHAPPY RETURNS: DeVon Edwards has two of his five career kickoff returns for touchdowns this season, including a 100-yarder last week against Georgia Tech. His average of 44.8 yards per return is tops in the ACC and second nationally. Duke is 5-0 when he brings a kickoff back for a score. \nGOING FOR 2-0: A win would make Duke 2-0 in ACC play for the second time under Cutcliffe and just the sixth time since 1970. The Blue Devils last won their first two ACC games in 2012. \nSERIES NOTES: This is just BC's second visit to Duke and its first since 2010, when the Eagles won 21-16. BC leads the series 4-2. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
