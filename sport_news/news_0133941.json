Schmitt created a \"Go Cubs Go\" design in his crop similar to the one he did in 2003 when the Cubs faced the Marlins in the National League Championship Series. By CAITLIN SWIECA — cswieca@nwherald.com \nSPRING GROVE — Ask Jack Schmitt what inspired the giant message in his soybean field, and he'll answer as if it's only natural to carve a giant \"GO CUBS GO\" in the middle of his crops. Related Links \n\"I'm a Cubs fan,\" Schmitt said. \nSure, that's the simplest answer, but his wife, Bev, will tell you he's no casual follower. \n\"He's a die-hard Cubs fan, I'll tell you that,\" Bev said. \"He's an exuberant fan and an enjoyer of life. That's part of his nature.\" \nJack Schmitt, 82, estimates he's been a Cubs fan for 70 years. Bev Schmitt says he's been working on the same Spring Grove farm for at least that long. \nHe can't quite remember, though, the Cubs' last World Series appearance, which came in 1945, exactly 70 years ago. \nHis optimism that this Cubs team can end that drought was clear when he decided to spend a half hour carving the message out with a tractor and disc when he was working Sunday. \nAt that point, the Cubs were tied with the St. Louis Cardinals at one game each in the National League Division Series. \nThe Cubs won their next two games to move on to the National League Championship Series, where they'll face the New York Mets. They now sit four wins from the World Series. \n\"I was glad the Mets won, because we beat them seven times this year, so I’m hoping that they come through,\" Jack Schmitt said. \"It’s been a long time.' \nHe said he put the same message in his field in 2003, and even though the Cubs lost to the Marlins in a seven-game NLCS that year, he had no qualms about repeating his work. \nThe family was able to get a photo of the tribute when they got a ride on their friend George Richardson's plane. Bev Schmitt said she's sent the photo to relatives near and far, who are all reveling in the Northsiders' success. \n\"I think Cubs fans stay Cubs fans no matter where they go,\" Bev Schmitt said. \"When you’re a Cubs fan, you never give it up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:48:25.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
