However, a loose service game from Fognini allowed his opponents to bring the match back on serve at 2-all. \nKlaasen/Melo held on to that momentum and broke again for 5-3. The pair then saved three break points to serve out the set in just 30 minutes. \nThe Italians were once again out to an early 2-0 advantage in the second set. But just as in the first set, Klaasen/Melo battled back to level the scoreboard at 2-2. Then Klaasen and Melo hit top gear and broke twice before taking the victory. \n\"The last two weeks have been great,\" said Klaasen. \"We've played some really good tennis together. I've enjoyed my time with him on the court. It's been a lot of fun on and off the court. When you win this much, it's good out there.\" \n\"For sure I expected us to have good results,\" said Melo. \"But I have to be honest, I never expected to win two tournaments at this level. I think we combine really well together. Raven has a really good volley and he knows how to cover a lot of the net. I also have a good volley, so passing us at the net is not that easy. We have fun and that's the most important thing for me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:37:10.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
