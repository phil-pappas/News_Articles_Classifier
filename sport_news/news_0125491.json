And they deserve to be out there too.\" M'Kenna Murphy (Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com ) \nOne of those young players is freshman forward Mikayla Bates , who scored both Crusaders goals in Tuesday night's 2-0 road win over Northwestern. \nIt was Notre Dame's fifth straight victory with all of them being shutouts. \n\"I think we're really getting a very good sense of team and we're all working with each other,\" Murphy said. \"It brings in an all togetherness that shows on the field. And that is how we score and that's how we win.\" \nMurphy has played a big part in the Crusaders' recent defensive success. \nShe did it again versus the Tigers, making eight saves. Murphy had a leaping save off a Northwestern corner kick with 24:11 left in regulation and showed off her vertical leap again just over a minute later when Emily Renner sent a free kick toward the net. \nAs is a common theme with the Crusaders, Murphy has experience on her side. \n\"M'Kenna is a very solid keeper,\" Aquilina said. \"She's been playing varsity keeper since her freshman year so she's got the experience behind her.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:39:28.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
