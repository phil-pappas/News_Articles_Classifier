They face a Missouri team coming off a 24-10 win over South Carolina with a true freshman starting quarterback. \nDrew Lock became the first true freshman quarterback to start for Missouri in 20 years when he replaced the suspended Maty Mauck last week. He completed 21 of 28 passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns.\"You see the confidence they have in him,'' McElwain said. \"They're doing the things that he is obviously successful at.\" \nThe Gators sit alone atop the SEC East and hope to stay there with a victory. \nWhile McElwain wasn't around for last season's loss, he can sense this one means something to the Gators beyond their current status. Same goes for Missouri. \n\"Based on history, I'm sure that they've got pretty good confidence that they will put it on the Gators,'' McElwain said. \"It's one of those deals where I'm sure based on that history, they felt pretty good about us being at homecoming.\" Report: Florida, Miami to battle in Orlando in 2019. \nMissouri has won six consecutive home games and the campus is pumped for a rare night game at Memorial Stadium. The Tigers did not have a night game last season. \n\"We've had some great wins in that stadium during the day,'' Tigers head coach Gary Pinkel said Wednesday. \"I just think the night atmosphere, our students feel it and are part of it. It's a pretty good environment.\" \nIn Florida's only other road game this season, the Gators defeated Kentucky 14-9 under the lights at Commonwealth Stadium. In the two games since, redshirt freshman quarterback Will Grier (554 yards passing, six touchdowns) has asserted himself to provide the offense with stability at a position that has lacked it recently. \nAfter practice Wednesday, McElwain said the team has responded well since the stunning victory over the Rebels. \n\"When there is a sense of urgency and a sense of focus from the meeting room to the practice field, at least you know comfortably that your guys are going to go compete,'' he said. \"That's what we're going to try to do.\" \nThe Gators offered no competition for the Tigers last season. They want to change that from the start on Saturday. \n\"Those guys are the champs,'' senior linebacker Antonio Morrison said. \"We're trying to knock them off.\" 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:43:24.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
