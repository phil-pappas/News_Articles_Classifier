Carter Stadium.\nClearly, these young Mustangs - and they are frightfully young as freshmen continued to earn more and more playing time - aren't afraid of a big stage.\nAnd that should serve SMU well moving forward. There are no more powerhouse opponents left on their schedule. They have gained valuable experience against Baylor and TCU, oviously among the nation's elite. They were embarrassed by neither of them.\n\"When you play two top five teams in the country, they better grow up pretty fast,\" coach Chad Morris said of his freshmen. \"We're playing a lot of freshmen and they're making a lot of mistakes. That's what happens when you play freshmen. Our program is not to the point where we can redshirt a bunch of guys.\n\"They're freshmen, and they're learning and that will pay big, big dividends as the season goes on.\"\nAgainst the Frogs, true freshmen running backs Xavier Jones and Braeden West got the bulk of the work in the backfield. Redshirt freshman receiver Courtland Sutton looks like the real deal and sophomore Ryheem Malone also played big.\nNobody in a higher classification than sophomore played a big role at skill positions for the Ponies, other than junior quarterback Matt Davis.\nAnd yet, they had a one-possession in the fourth quarter, trailing just 42-37.\nVirtually unseen on the field for the Mustangs: upperclassmen Prescott Line and Deion Sanders Jr., both of whom were presumed to be two of SMU's heavy lifters going into the season.\nInstead, the youth movement is firmly afoot.\n\"I really think we're going to have a leg up on the other people in the conference because of that,\" Davis said. \"We might have had the toughest preseason schedule in the whole country. And we stuck around with them. We're not proud of sticking around with them. We prepare to win. And we want to win. But I'm super-pleased. Getting that experience is going to help us a lot in the future.\"\nConsider who made the plays that enabled the Mustangs to throw a huge scare into the No. 3 team in the land.\nShelby Walker, a sophomore, caught a 35-yard pass to ignite the third-quarter drive that ended with a touchdown and drew the Mustangs within 42-24.\nAfter an interception by junior Horace Richardson, Davis found West for 19 yards that set up another quick TD.\nA 46-yard strike from Davis to Sutton put the Mustangs in position for the field goal that made it an eight-point game. Another deep ball to Sutton after SMU stopped TCU on fourth-and-one, set up another field goal that made it 42-37 with still more than eight minutes to play.\nObviously, the Mustangs had the Frogs' attention.\nThey drove down the field and pushed it back to a two-score game when Trevone Boykin hit Josh Doctson on a 42-yard scoring toss with 6:32 to play. That put the Frogs up 49-37.\nThe Mustangs were denied, but not without sending a strong message about the direction they are headed.\nWhile moral victories aren't anybody's idea of success, the Mustangs know now that they have the ability to compete with anybody. With James Madison wrapping up the non-conference schedule next week, which should give them a good shot at going into American Athletic Conference play with a 2-2 record.\nMORE COVERAGE\nClick here to visit the SMU page.\nNichols: SMU throws scare into No. 3 TCU, but Frogs QB Boykin's six TDs too much for Mustangs\nExperience playing Baylor, TCU for SMU freshmen will 'will pay big, big dividends' as season progresses\nSMU-TCU quick hits: Frogs strike quickly in first half; Mustangs test TCU secondary\nPhotos: Trevone Boykin leads TCU as Frogs claim Iron Skillet with 56-37 win over SMU\nFive Thoughts: SMU shows no quit under Chad Morris, nearly shocks rival TCU\nClick here to visit the TCU page.\nFive thoughts from No. 3 TCU's 56-37 win over SMU: Horned Frogs escape upset bid to capture Iron Skillet\nOn Twitter:\n @ESefko", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-3-tcus-56-37-win-smu-horned-frogs-escape-upset-bid-capture-iron-skillet", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/smu-tcu-quick-hits-frogs-strike-quickly-first-half-mustangs-test-tcu-secondary", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/smu-mustangs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcu-horned-frogs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-smu-shows-quit-chad-morris-nearly-shocks-rival-tcu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/nichols-smu-throws-scare-3-tcu-frogs-qb-boykins-six-tds-much-mustangs", "https://twitter.com/ESefko", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/09/19/photos-trevone-boykin-leads-tcu-battle-iron-skillet-smu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/solid-outings-baylor-tcu-means-experience-smu-freshmen-will-will-pay-big-big-dividends-season-progresses"], "published": "2015-09-20T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:48:01.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
