To help students get into the expanding career, the University of South Dakota has now added a Sports Marketing and Media degree. \nThe Communication and Media departments offer 20 different areas of study at the University of South Dakota, but the newest one is already creating buzz. \n\"We want to be one of the leaders in sports marketing and media in the region,\" Instructor Gary Larson said. \nThis is the first degree of its kind in South Dakota, and one of only a handful of programs nationwide. \nJunior Brandon Newell came to USD to study accounting, but he changed majors after working with Coyote News as a sports reporter. When he heard about the new degree, he knew it was the career for him. \n\"Marketing is going to be all about talking, getting into sales or getting involved with other people. It's not so much being behind a desk all day. And media, it's huge. The thing is opening up like crazy so I just saw it as an eye-opener and something to jump on,\" Newell said. \nNewell is working on creating a video for his multimedia design class. The degree is multi-disciplinary, with students able to use it for sales and marketing, public relations, event management, and broadcast journalism, just to name a few. After graduation Newell says he would like to get involved with a professional team like the Sioux Falls Skyforce. As for what he will exactly use his degree for... \n\"I don't know, I still got one more year left,\" Newell said. \nIn that same classroom Chris Timmerman works on his project. He's too far along into his Media and Journalism degree to switch at this point, but he thinks it will be a great thing for incoming freshmen. \n\"Now that we're division one in most of our sports it just really helps a lot more people get involved with sports at this University and I think it's great that it's so specialized now and students can focus on the actual sports aspect of marketing and media,\" Timmerman said. \nGary Larson is the man leading this class. He's one of the USD instructors with experience in sports and media. He was a basketball coach at the University, and worked for CBS during the Final Four. \n\"Having that background I think will help our program a lot and we have other people in our department that have their strengths that we can all bring in and tie into this, including other programs from the business school and the ed school that are also involved with this program,\" Larson said. \nWhile sports media and marketing is a growing field across the nation, Larson says it's a growing field right here in KELOLAND. \nLarson points to the sports at the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center, as well as the new sports performance enhancement complex on USD's campus as ways to use this degree locally. \n\"We can help promote all those buildings, all those facilities, all the events that will go on with those facilities, so I think everybody is really excited about it,\" Larson said. \nThe university expects to eventually graduate up to 15 sport marketing students each year, but current students expect that number to be much higher. \n\"You get tons of experience which I think helps you grow way more than anywhere in a classroom would,\" Timmerman said. \n\"I think that gives us more of an advantage being able to learn how to run stuff. Run video, create videos, we're starting blogs, how to create a blog. Just doing as much as you can now can really helps students, and this program, long term,\" Newell said. \nA new degree with high expectations. \nClasses are being taught through four existing majors: kinesiology, media and journalism, communication studies and business marketing.
