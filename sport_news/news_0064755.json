(Getty Images) \nIt would've been easy for Matt Harvey to put a fastball in Adrian Gonzalez's ear during the first inning of Game 3 of the Mets-Dodgers NLDS. For all the talk of retribution for Chase Utley's slide that broke Ruben Tejada's leg in Game 2, a beanball would've set some kind of tone. Certainly the Citi Field crowd on Monday night seemed all riled up from the very beginning. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nBut the Mets decided on a different, better tactic: They pounded the Dodgers into submission, slowly and without letting up. The night wore on and New York kept walking and hitting and scoring, a team postseason-record 13 runs in all. \nWith this vital Game 3 victory, the Mets are now just one win away from their first National League Championship Series since 2006 -- you know, just as we all predicted before this season. What was so heartening for the Mets wasn't just that they won but how they won. Harvey was far from perfect (5 IP, 2 ER, 7 K's), and his pitches didn't seem to be getting much movement. Early on, Dodgers hitters weren't fooled and the three runs he gave up in the second (one off a throwing error by Curtis Granderson) had the Citi Field fans feeling a smidge nervous. \nBut it didn't take long for the Mets to unload on Los Angeles starter Brett Anderson. Four straight singles in the bottom of the second cut the deficit to 3-1, and New York loaded the bases with no outs. After a Juan Lagares force out and a Harvey strikeout, the Mets needed a big hit to avoid wasting such a run-scoring opportunity. Granderson delivered (making up for that error in the top half of the inning), roping a bases-clearing double to the right-center power alley. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nNew York never gave up the lead again, but kept padding it along the way. Yoenis Cespedes' monstrous homer in the bottom of the fourth broke the game open at 10-3 and from there it was all over (though with two more hours of baseball to go). \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThe 34-year-old Granderson went 2-for-5 with 5 RBIs, tying a Mets franchise postseason record and taking another major step in what has been an impressive, if somewhat under-the-radar comeback season. His .364 on-base percentage as a leadoff man, including 26 homers, set a consistent tone for the Mets' offense all year long, especially once the new lineup additions (such as Cespedes) arrived at the Trade Deadline. From Aug. 1 on, Granderson had an .885 OPS from the leadoff spot and scored 45 runs in 54 games. While he doesn't have the range or arm or speed he once did -- he only stole 11 bases in 17 attempts this season -- he's a veteran presence on this team and a mentor to future stars like Michael Conforto (whom he may share an outfield with next season). \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers could do little right on Monday night. Anderson (6 ERs in 3 IP) did not give L.A. the non-Kershaw/Greinke buffer it was hoping for, and the bullpen was ineffective. The Dodgers' lineup did manage to crank out 13 hits, but much of that came late in garbage time against Mets relievers you likely won't see again. The fact that the offense couldn't do much against a less-than-steller Harvey has to worry manager Don Mattingly, with his $300 million team now one bad loss away from ending the season (and possibly his tenure with the team). \nRookie Steven Matz, with all of six career starts, will be called on for Tuesday's Game 4 to try and beat Kershaw, who'll be pitching on short rest. If the Mets falter, it's back to L.A. for a Game 5 showdown between Greinke and Jacob deGrom. While the idea of a 1-0, 23-inning deciding game is tantalizing -- and you can flip a coin as to who wins that one -- the Mets would prefer to just end the affair Tuesday night in front of what will surely be another delirious home crowd. It's unlikely that they will hang a baker's dozen on either of the Dodgers' NL Cy Young Award candidates, but they now have some confidence in the offense, regardless. \nAs for the Dodgers, time is running out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:01:23.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
