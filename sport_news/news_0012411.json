This market is expected to reach $2.0 billion by 2015 and $2.2 billion by 2020, registering a compound\nannual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9% from 2015 to 2020.\n- Football equipment will grow from $354.9 million in 2015 to $521.4 million by 2020, increasing at a CAGR of 8.0% from 2015 to 2020.\n- Cycling as a segment will grow from $$773.7 million in 2015 to about $884.0 million in 2020, at a 2.7% CAGR from 2015 to 2020.\nIntroduction & Scope\nINTRODUCTION\nSTUDY BACKGROUND\nOver the past several years, people have become very aware of the risk of long-term brain damage due to injuries suffered in contact sports such as football. The number of boys playing youth and high school football has declined significantly over the last few years, to the point where college and professional teams have expressed concerns over a shrinking pool of young talent in the game. The National Football League (NFL) has been sued by over 5,000 of its former players on the grounds that it did not do enough to inform them about the dangers of concussion and is not doing enough to take care of players who were injured. In 2015,\na federal judge approved a settlement that provides up to $5 million per player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma. As long ago as 1905, Teddy Roosevelt convened a meeting of the most influential figures in football to reduce the level of violence. Roosevelt's meeting resulted in significant rule changes in the game, such as the outlawing of rugby-style mass formations and gang tackling, increasing the distance required for a first down from five yards to ten yards to encourage plays that did not go through the center of the line, and the introduction of the forward pass. The introduction of new rules to reduce the likelihood of injury has represented on element of a two-pronged strategy for reducing serious head injuries in football; the other prong has been the introduction of new types of football helmets that do a better job of protecting the player. The attempt to design a better football helmet goes back at least as far as World War I, when the first full skull protection football helmets were introduced to replace the soft leather \"head\nharnesses\" that many players then wore.\nWhile the risks of playing football are more widely known than those of most other sports due to the game's popularity and its players' visibility, other sports must contend with safety risks of their own.\nGOALS AND OBJECTIVES\nThe overall goal of this study is to identify and quantify the market for protective sports equipment. Specific objectives include the following:\n- Identifying current and emerging technologies for protecting participants in various sports against traumatic or repeated-use injuries.\n- Analyzing and predicting trends in user markets for each of these technologies, as the basis for developing baseline estimates of the sports market for protective sports\nequipment.\n- Identifying and quantifying the key demand drivers in each of these markets and their projected market impacts.\n- Drawing attention to manufacturers of sports protection equipment that are most likely to benefit from the trends identified above.\nINTENDED AUDIENCE\nThe report is directed to the various companies interested in protective sports equipment, including:\n- Companies involved in developing, manufacturing and supplying protective sports equipment.\n- Manufacturers, suppliers and users of the materials used in protective sports equipment.\n- Companies interested in participating in the development, manufacture, supply and/or use of protective sports equipment.\n- Organizations that purchase/use protective sports equipment.\nThis report is intended especially for developers and vendors of protective sports equipment and materials used in the fabrication of such equipment and others with an interest in understanding where the market is headed with respect to sports protective technologies, including:\n- Members of industry and technical organizations such as the Sports and Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) and ASTM (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials).\n- Officials of sports organizations.\n- Government regulatory authorities.\n- The general sports and technology interest communities, including journalists.\nSCOPE AND FORMAT\nThis report focuses on protective equipment worn in nonmotor sports, including:\n- Football.\n- Baseball/softball.\n- Ice hockey.\n- Soccer.\n- Lacrosse.\n- Cycling.\n- Fencing.\n- Skiing/snowboarding.\n- Wrestling.\n- Roller sports.\n- Water polo.\n- Climbing.\n- Equestrian sports.\n- Boxing.\nThe emphasis is on commercially available equipment that is designed to prevent injury, rather than to protect injured tissue and promote healing once injury has occurred. The report also does not cover devices whose main purpose is enhancing performance and/or comfort, although they may also protect against injury. Athletic footwear is not included, because of the difficulty of distinguishing between sales of shoes to serious athletes, to whom their protective value is significant, and more casual wearers who wear them primarily for comfort and/or style. A similar rationale applies to cold weather clothing, such as ski parkas.\nThe report format includes the following major elements:\n- Executive summary.\n- Definitions.\n- Regulation.\n- Technologies (basic principles, materials, specific applications, major patents).\n- Major end-user markets, 2014.\n- Market drivers.\n- Projected sales, 2015 to 2020.\n- Manufacturer profiles.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe findings and conclusions of this report are based on both primary and secondary research methodologies. Market information was gathered from sports products manufacturers, materials and devices vendors, and sports-related organizations. Interview data were combined with information gathered through an extensive review of secondary sources such as trade publications, trade associations, company literature\nand on-line databases to produce the baseline market estimates contained in this report. The base-year for analysis and projection is 2014. With 2014 as a baseline, market projections were developed for 2015 to 2020. These projections are based on a combination of a consensus among the primary contacts combined with BCC Research's understanding of the key market drivers and their impact from a historical\nand analytical perspective. The analytical methodologies used to generate the market estimates are described in detail in the section on the U.S. market for sports protective equipment. All market projections presented in this report are in 2014 constant dollars at the retail level, unless otherwise noted.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p01556798-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
