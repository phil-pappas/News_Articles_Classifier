Polar Expedition, three-day photography exhibition by Mitul Dikshit, takes the viewer on a visual journey all through Scandinavia; covering Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Greenland and Svalbard Islands in the Arctic Circle. Polar frame\nAs the name rightly leads you on, Polar Bears show up pretty much in every alternate frame commanding every inch of the frames dedicated to them; as The Three Musketeers in an interactive mode, in a photograph titled Solitary in a pensive mood. Sitting by itself, on the move searching for direction or looking at its own reflection! “The best part about the expedition was Polar bears and the landscapes. That is more than enough motivation to hold a camera and start clicking.” Rests of the frames depict walrus seals, reindeers, birds, other wildlife and icebergs in various lights. “Every fifteen minutes the light changes,” he shares, having earlier exhibited on the Masai Mara, underwater escapades on the Great Barrier Reef. This time, a close brush with the Arctic and Antarctic happened out of sheer love for the wildlife and the unknown! Like father, like son\nOf the mind-boggling 23,000 photographs, he shares, “I shortlisted 150 photographs and thank God this place restricts you in terms of what you can display.” While the captions are only in the nature of titles, he shares, “I did not give them since I am not in favour of captions. The idea is to leave it open to viewer’s interpretation.” Out of the total 46 photographs displayed, 11 are by his son Idant! Focus on a little boy’s perspective on a new place; comprising a bus, a street performer! Up next\nIn the pipeline is a coffee table book on the expedition, due sometime early next year. “Its working title is Antarctica—God’s Own Canvas and it will be the most comprehensive book you’ll ever find on Antarctica.” Due also is yet another expedition, once again a close brush with Polar bears. “I am looking at getting to Alaska again and this time exploring dense habitat of Polar bears.” Each travel expedition calls for a thousand stories, which he lets pictures take care of. “I live for travel.” Cheers to that!
