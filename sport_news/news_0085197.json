But the outcome was well on its way. White’s school-record 100-yard interception return for a touchdown ended a 64-yard, and nearly nine-minute, Methodist drive and put Huntingdon (6-1, 4-0 USA South) in front 14-0 with 2:33 left in the first quarter. “That was a huge momentum swing for us,” Huntingdon head coach Mike Turk said. “We were up 7-0 and they were down to our 6-yard line. If they score there, who knows, it might have been a different game. But our guys kept fighting. “This win was a step in the right direction. This was the first time we’ve beaten Methodist and it’s a big win for us. It’s exciting to be 4-0 in the conference, but, we still have a long way to go.” In its third season in the USA South, this is the first time Huntingdon has started 4-0 in conference play. The Hawks travel to Greensboro next week before hosting Maryville and Averett to close out the regular season. “We have three conference games remaining and the target on our back is getting bigger each week,” Turk sai d. “We hav e to handle that the right way. We have to have the maturity level to know what’s at stake and come out ready to play our best each game.” In Saturday’s win, the Hawks took advantage of their opportunities early. In addition to White’s interception return, the defense helped set up two other touchdowns with turnovers and stifled the Monarchs’ offense Methodist, which gained 111 yards in the first quarter, finished the game with 265 yards on 75 plays. “Every conference win is a big win,” said White, who had two interceptions in the game. “But we came into this one with a little bit of a chip on our shoulder because we had never beaten them. We played with a lot of intensity today. We played assignment football and each player did his job.” Defensive lineman Heath McCray forced a fumble on a sack on Methodist’s first possession of the game and freshman Trey Hayes recovered near midfield. Five plays later, quarterback Luke Bailey connected with Nick Haas for an 11-yard touchdown with 11:08 left in the first quarter. The Huntingdon offense didn’t take the field again until four minutes into the second quarter. The Hawks ran just five offensive plays in the first quarter and 23 plays in the first half, but led 28-3 at halftime. “We were opportunistic today,” Turk said. “The defense played well and set us up in good field position several times and each time we were able to come away with touchdowns.” White’s second interception, which he returned 23 yards to the Methodist 16-yard line, set up the Hawks’ third touchdown. Huntingdon scored in two plays as Bailey ran 11 yards for the touchdown and a 21-3 lead. Bailey found Haas again just before the half, this time on a 5-yard touchdown pass to cap the first-half scoring. The Hawks closed their scoring on their first two possession of the second half. Bailey connected with Darius Dawsey for a 9-yard score and Vic Jerald broke free for a 52-yard touchdown run with 10:43 left in the third quarter. Bailey finished with 140 yards passing and three touchdowns on a 10-of-17 day. He also ran for 49 yards and a touchdown. John Iwaniec led the ground game with 93 yards on seven carries and Jerald added 81 yards on eight carries. Haas finished with 67 yards receiving and the two scores on five receptions. Freshman kicker Chase Young converted all six extra point attempts. Defensively, Jake Green and Lake Romine each had eight tackles and Octavis Harris and Anthony Wood each had seven tackles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:15:19.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
