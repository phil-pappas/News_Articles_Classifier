They changed drastically in the last year and that’s Mario’s credit,” Ayerza said. \nGiven the attacking style of both teams, though, an exciting running game is in the offing. \n“It’s great to see an Argentina team playing such good rugby and it’s a bonus on top of the passion of our traditional game,” said Ayerza, part of the squad that won the bronze medal in 2007. \n“It’s nice to see the global dimension this team is getting and which obliges us to play to the same standard to show our best version. We know we are two matches away from the world championship but we are also aware of all we still have to do to be better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:48:44.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
