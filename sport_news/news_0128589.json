Sauk Rapids is 5-4 in the conference and 8-7 overall. \nThe Storm are led by Kyra Harvey and Alisa Watson. They’ve lost to Rocori twice this season, once in the Sauk Rapids tournament. \nIt’s the start of a busy week, not only for Rocori and Sauk Rapids, but for all prep sports. \nThere’s prep football playoffs Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday. \nThere is no school Thursday and Friday because of Education Minnesota! meetings in the Twin Cities. \nThat means Thursday’s a big volleyball day at Sartell. The Sabres are host to their own invitational and have Foley and St. Cloud Cathedral coming as well as Hibbing, Maple Grove, Mound Westonka and St. Louis Park in the all-day tournament. \nAnd, the boys and girls soccer playoffs get under way Thursday. By Saturday, everyone will have played at least one match. Those seeds should be set over the weekend. \nA quick look at the schedule: \nTuesday \n• St. Cloud Tech Invitational cross country meet, 4:30 p.m. at Boulder Ridge Golf Club. \nThe location is changed for this huge meet, which includes St. Cloud Apollo, Sartell, Sauk Rapids, Cathedral and Little Falls as well as teams from Brainerd, Forest Lake, Rogers and Princeton. In the past, it has been run at Oak Hill Community School. \nFriday \n• Section 8-2A girls tennis championships, noon at Fitness Evolution, Sartell. \nThis is the first of two days as it is determined who is headed to the state meet. The team championship is wrapped up Friday. Tech’s the South Sub-Section 8-2A top seed. Thief River Falls is No. 1 in the North. The championship match is scheduled for 6 p.m. The individual tournament is Saturday. \nThe top team and the top two singles players and top two doubles teams advance to the state Class 2A meet Oct 27-30 at the University of Minnesota’s Baseline Tennis Center in Minneapolis. \nThis is the opinion of Times prep sports coordinator Tom Elliott.
