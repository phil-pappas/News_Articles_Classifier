The statistic that matters to him is the one Cook now has more of than any quarterback in program history: wins.\n“Quarterbacks are here to win. They’re not here for statistics,” Dantonio said. “It’s great vindication for a quarterback, but it’s also a program thing for our entire program. What it means is that this program has won at an unparalleled level for a number of years.”\nNo. 2 MSU (5-0 overall, 1-0 Big Ten) built an early 21-0 lead today, then held on late to secure a 24-21 victory against Purdue (1-4, 0-1) in the Spartans’ 100th homecoming. The victory was Cook’s 28th as the Spartans’ starting quarterback, passing former teammate Kirk Cousins for most in program history.\n“It’s a great accomplishment and it means a lot, but a lot of the credit goes to being on a team with a great defense,” Cook said. “If you’re not playing your best game, they can make you look better.”\nIt wasn’t a flashy game for Cook, who completed 13 of 19 passes for 139 yards and a touchdown and leaned heavily on his running game in the second half behind conservative play calling.\nHe completed only 3 of 7 passes for 11 yards in the second half, but ran five times for 48 yards, including a 22-yard run to put the Spartans in scoring range.\n“The weather and stuff made me not trust in my arm as much,” Cook said of a rainy day. “Finally, I kind of, you know, got out of my shell today and rushed a little bit.”\nFreshman running back LJ Scott ran for a career-high 146 yards and two touchdowns, but said it was Cook’s running ability which changed the game.\n“When he’s a threat as a ball carrier, it makes our offense tougher to defend,” Scott said. “He stepped up and did whatever he had to do today to win the game. … Connor made some big-time throws, too. He’s the man.”\nDownload our new Spartans Xtra app for free on Apple and Android devices!\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nMSU notes: Finley has surgery after breaking leg\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nMSU 24, Purdue 21: How the Spartans won", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spartans-xtra/id977780997?mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gannett.dolly.Spartans&hl=en", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/58cd4e06e6e1a9563d004f5d4fabd7a4b7a9423c/c=0-294-2029-2323/local/-/media/2015/10/03/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635794882673209515-msu-100315-kd-9.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/222d8bf0ded28a42bbd832ae2ad55e15b97aa9d4/c=141-0-2365-2224/local/-/media/2015/10/03/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635794956863465613-AP-Purdue-Michigan-St-Footba.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:16:13.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
