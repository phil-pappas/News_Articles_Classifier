Comment Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated Oct 22, 2015 at 2:45 AM Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated Oct 22, 2015 at 2:45 AM By most measures, Ohio State's defense has been solid this season. The Buckeyes rank 19th nationally in total defense and 13th in scoring defense. They are fourth in passing yards allowed and 23rd in stopping opponents on third down. But their coaches and players believe that Ohio State still has plenty of room for improvement heading into Saturday night's game at Rutgers. 'We just had a conversation about that,' coach Urban Meyer said on Wednesday night. 'Obviously, the expectation level here is to have the best defense, the best offense and the best kicking game. We're not there yet, (but) I think it's very close.' In certain ways, the Buckeyes defense has resembled a water balloon. Squeeze one part tight, and another bulges. >> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards Last week, they all but shut down Penn State's passing game. Except for a couple of big plays by receiver Chris Godwin, quarterback Christian Hackenberg could do little. He completed only seven passes. But freshman running back Saquon Barkley ran wild, gaining 194 yards. The two previous weeks, Ohio State allowed quarterbacks to run for big plays but contained opponents' running backs. 'We have to do a better job stopping the run,' defensive line coach Larry Johnson said. 'To have a great defense, you have to stop the run and make them one-dimensional. '(Against the pass) I think we're doing a great job getting at the quarterback and really changing the flight of the ball and how they do things, and creating havoc in the middle.' Ohio State is tied for fifth nationally in sacks per game (3.43). Teams have geared their blocking schemes toward trying to neutralize Joey Bosa, and that has allowed the rest of the defensive line to flourish. The Buckeyes moved Bosa inside on some passing downs against Penn State and inserted Sam Hubbard to give them four bona fide pass-rushers. Page 2 of 3 - 'Especially when I get single-teamed, I like going in the middle,' Bosa said with a sly smile. 'Getting our best pass rushers out there, it's fun to fly after the quarterback and pretty much have all four of us get there at the same time.' >> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! The Buckeyes will be challenged by a Rutgers offense that is averaging 34.3 points a game. Quarterback Chris Laviano leads the Big Ten in completion percentage (.693). Leonte Carroo is one of the country's top receivers, though Scarlet Knights coach Kyle Flood said Carroo is questionable because of an ankle injury suffered late in a comeback victory over Indiana last week. The Buckeyes have their own injury issues on defense. Nose guard Tommy Schutt, whose play has improved markedly recently, is out after having wrist surgery. Johnson said that Joel Hale and Michael Hill will replace him, and he also is considering using freshman Robert Landers. Outside linebacker Joshua Perry, who suffered a sprained ankle early against Penn State was limited in practice on Wednesday. Bosa said he was encouraged by his teammates' reaction after Perry got injured. >> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter 'I didn't sense anybody panicked, and he's such a leader to this team and defense,' Bosa said. 'Usually, when a guy like that goes down, it's panic and, 'What are we going to do?' I didn't sense any of that.' Page 3 of 3 - As the season hits the stretch run, the Buckeyes know it's time to jell. 'I think we're headed in the right direction,' sophomore cornerback Gareon Conley said. 'We only gave up 10 points last week, but we have high expectations, and we know we can be better.' brabinowitz@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:44:37.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
