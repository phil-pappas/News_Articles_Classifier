LBJ amassed 301 total yards in the opening half while holding the Cougars to 82. \nIsaiah Feaster led the balanced Jags as he rumbled for 62 yards on eight carries, including four touchdown runs. Deandre Wytaske added 74 yards on six carries, and he also also caught an 18-yard scoring pass from sophomore quarterback Aaron Green. \nGreen, who entered the game on LBJ’s third drive, finished the game 12-of-15 passing for 128 yards. Kahlil Thomas carried the ball just twice, but he scored on both carries, one TD covering 38 yards. \nThe LBJ defense was stingy all night, limiting Crockett to 143 yards, 48 on the ground. \nAshton Williams returned an interception 98 yards in the fourth quarter for a Jaguars score, thwarting Crockett (1-6, 1-4) on its only trip into the red zone. \nAnderson 28, Lehman 0: Two interception returns for touchdowns in a six-minute span bridging the second and third quarters put a stamp on the Anderson’s shutout of winless Lehman at Nelson Field. \nAnderson (4-5, 2-5 in District 14-6A) earned its second consecutive victory after losing five straight district outings. The first interception TD came late in the second quarter when the Trojans’ Wes Engeling picked off Lehman quarterback Jacob Zamora and rambled untouched for a 26-yard score. \nThe second pick-six came on Lehman’s first drive of the third quarter, as Zamora’s pass was tipped and grabbed on the run by Anderson’s Eric Slatter, who raced 28 yards to the end zone. A third interception-return TD by the Trojans’ Richard Ross, which came in the fourth quarter, was called back because of a holding penalty. \nThe Trojans scored first-half touchdowns on a nifty 34-yard reverse by Trey Espinoza and on a 43-yard TD pass from Trey Lundquist to Jacob Graves. \nLehman (0-8, 0-6) had trouble moving the ball, and saw most of its success come late in the game, when it went to the Wildcat offense that called for a direct snap to wide receiver Jeremiah Brown, who gained 63 yards on 13 carries. \n— Steve Habel, AA-S correspondent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:18:15.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
