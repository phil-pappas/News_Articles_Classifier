A resulting algorithm correctly predicted the men's sexual orientation nearly 70% of the time.\nResearchers presented the controversial findings at the American Society of Human Genetics annual meeting in Baltimore this week, though they have yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first example of a predictive model for sexual orientation based on molecular markers,\" says lead author Tuck Ngun in a press release .\nA skeptical molecular geneticist said such tests are prone to false positives due to \"spurious associations that are down to sheer chance,\" reports New Scientist. Another added that it needs to be replicated \"on larger samples in order to know how good it is, but in theory it's quite interesting.\"\nThe UCLA researchers used saliva samples from 47 pairs of identical male twins in which at least one of the two was gay\nNgun himself is gay and says he has no intention of pursuing some kind of commercial application for the results. In fact, he's done with the field entirely.\n\"I just left the lab last week,\" he says. \"I don’t believe in the censoring of knowledge, but given the potential for misuse of the information, it just didn’t sit well with me.\"\n(Almost one in three young Americans say they are some degree of bisexual .)\nNEWSER\nCourt Says Founder of Bikram Yoga Can't Tell You How, Or How Not, to Pose\nNEWSER\nShe Was Checking Facebook While Her Child Drowned.
