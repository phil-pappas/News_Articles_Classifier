Shutdown cornerback Prince Amukamara is going to miss two to four weeks with a partially torn pectoral muscle. He leads the team with seven passes defended. \nGiants coach Tom Coughlin disclosed the chest injury before Thursday's practice, which put Jayron Hosley into the starting lineup for the second time this season. \nHosley started against Washington on Sept. 24 when Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie was out with a concussion. \nHosley has come a long way this season. Heading into training camp, there were not a lot of people who thought he was going to make the roster. The 2012 third-round draft pick had had his chances in the first three seasons in the league and fell short more often than not. \n\"It was a confidence thing for me with all the ups and downs I had those couple of years,\" Hosley said. \"Now I am more focused and confident in my game. I'm more mature. I have been around. This is my fourth year and I have been a starter before and played in big games. Like I said it's nothing new I am ready for the challenge.\" \nMaturity is a word Hosley uses a lot. He learned what it takes to play in the NFL. He worked hard, but never hard enough. \nHosley also got a push from new defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. He told Hosley early he was good enough play, if put his mind to it. \n\"It means nothing if you don't have the same confidence in yourself,\" he added. \"But it helps when you have a coach behind you, pushing you and wants the best out of you.\" \nThis is the second straight year Amukamara has been hurt while having an excellent season. He missed the final eight games of last season after tearing his right biceps. The pectoral injury is on his left side. \nWhile discouraged with another injury, Amukamara is happy he will be able to return this season. \n\"I'm very encouraged, because I'm more mobile, I can move it around,\" said Amukamara, who was hurt making a tackle against the 49ers on Sunday night. \"I can still brush my teeth and stuff like that, and do stuff with it.\" \nAmukamara said Hosley played well after Rodgers-Cromartie was hurt against Atlanta and then missed the next game. \n\"I feel like he is playing great for us and he is definitely ready,\" Amukamara said. \nTrevin Wade and Trumaine McBride will play the nickel back in passing situations. \nThe status of Beckham and Randle is a little more uncertain. \nBeckham did not practice on Thursday. Randle was limited. Victor Cruz remains sidelined indefinitely with a calf injury. \nIf none of them play, the Giants receivers will be Dwayne Harris, rookie Geremy David and the recently signed Myles White. The three have combined for 13 catches this season with Harris having 11. \nNotes: The Giants signed cornerback Brandon McGee and offensive lineman Xavier Proctor to their practice squad. To make room, the team terminated the contracts of offensive lineman Adam Gettis and tight end Dominique Jones. ...Besides Cruz and Beckham, linebackers Jon Beason (concussion), Jonathan Casillas (calf) and Devon Kennard (hamstring) all did not practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:02:18.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
