The answer will come when they host the unbeaten Panthers Sunday afternoon (KPTV-12, (FOX), 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET) .\nWhether the Seahawks are prepared mentally for the Panthers or still suffering from a hangover from Cincinnati is just one issue. The Seahawks defense has cracked late in four of the five games this season, leaving some people to wonder if its reign as a dominant defense has passed. The offense and quarterback Russell Wilson will receive boost by the return of running back Marshawn Lynch . Lynch is expected to play after missing two games with an injured hamstring.\nCarolina quarterback Cam Newton and the Panthers are unbeaten, but few are convinced they are on the same level as Green Bay, Arizona or even the Seahawks. Their wins have come against mediocre and bad teams, so they have an opportunity to make a strong statement in the game against Seattle.\nif you want to watch the Seahawks host the Panthers, here's what you need to know:\nWhat : Carolina Panthers at Seattle Seahawks\nWhere : CenturyLink Field, Seattle, WA\nWhen : Sunday, Oct. 18, 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET\nTV : KPTV-12 (Fox)\nWatch online : You can watch the live stream onlive on DirecTV's live stream package\n-- Geoffrey C.
