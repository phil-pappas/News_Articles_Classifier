By RALPH D. RUSSOAP College Football Writer \nFacing the possibility of being out of the playoff picture five weeks into the season, No. 13 Alabama announced it is far from finished. \nFacing the possibility of being upset in Indiana, No. 1 Ohio State wiggled out of a tight spot to keep its winning streak going. Whether it was good enough to keep the Buckeyes in the top spot remains to be seen. \nThe first Saturday of October was dominated by huge conference showdowns and ranked vs. ranked matchups that will start to shape the College Football Playoff race. Alabama looks as if it is going to be part of that chase for a while. \nThe Crimson Tide (4-1) rolled into No. 8 Georgia knowing another loss would be devastating to its national championship hopes and ran right over the Bulldogs, 38-10. \n\"I know they've been criticized a lot, but I thought we played an outstanding game today, every part of the game,\" coach Nick Saban said. \nTwo weeks after people were asking whether Saban's Crimson Tide was a fading dynasty, Alabama put together maybe the most dominant effort by any team this season in game that was very much suited to its preferred style. Sure Alabama's offense has stepped into the spread, up-tempo age with offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin. But the Tide is still power at heart, both on offense and defense. Georgia is, too, but the Bulldogs were no match for Derrick Henry, Reggie Ragland and the Tide. \nWhile Alabama looked great, the pressure isn't off the Crimson Tide. That loss to Mississippi doesn't disappear off the Tide's resume. 'Bama still needs some help just to win the SEC West and cannot afford another loss. \nSome of that help came Saturday night in the Swamp. No. 25 Florida (5-0) matched Alabama's dominance in a 38-10 victory against the Rebels (4-1). \nHoping to reach the final four with two losses and no conference championship is a long shot. The Tide have plenty of tough SEC tests left, but considering the way Alabama responded facing maybe its biggest obstacle, you have to like its chances. \nAs for Georgia, technically the loss wasn't devastating for its playoff hopes - if that's any consolation for Bulldogs fans? If the Bulldogs win out and win the SEC, and their schedule sets up relatively manageable the rest of the way, they could still reach the College Football Playoff. But after that performance, it's hard to imagine Georgia easily righting itself. And while SEC East rival Florida looks as if it has found a quarterback in Will Grier, the Bulldogs (4-1) might be going back to square one in its QB search. \nAP poll voters might be searching, too, on Sunday. Who should be No. 1 in the country after the Buckeyes' great escape from Bloomington, Indiana? \nEzekiel Elliot had three long touchdown runs in the second half, but Ohio State turnovers kept Indiana (4-1) in it right to the end - even with a backup quarterback and backup running back leading the Hoosiers offense. A bad snap blew up Indiana's final play on fourth-and-goal and the Buckeyes (5-0) won 34-27. \nOhio State 2015 is starting to look like Florida State 2014. Much like last year, the defending champions have been less than dominant. But they are unbeaten. The winning streak is now 18, but you have to wonder if the Buckeyes will be on top of the new AP Top 25. \nIf not the Buckeyes, then who? No. 2 Michigan State (5-0) needed a late stand to hold off Purdue 24-21 at home. No. 3 Ole Miss was crushed. No. 4 TCU and No. 5 Baylor both won huge. Things weren't going well for No. 6 Notre Dame against No. 12 Clemson at soggy Death Valley. \n\"Look across the country and every day you better play,\" Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said. \"You better play.\" \nThe opinions that matter most won't be revealed for another month. The first College Football Playoff selection committee rankings come out Nov. 3. \nWinning ugly was fine for Florida State last year because the Seminoles won them all until the playoff. Ohio State will likely be afforded the same courtesy. As would pretty much any team from a Power Five conference. \nThere is plenty of time clear some things up. Or make them even more muddled. Probably the latter. \n___ \nAP Sports Writers Paul Newberry in Athens, Georgia, and Michael Marot in Bloomington, Indiana, contributed. \n___ \nFollow Ralph D.
