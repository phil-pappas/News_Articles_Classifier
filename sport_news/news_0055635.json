The previous Missouri State record was 208 set by Damaso Carerra in 2008. \nMissouri State had a team score of 854 and finished fourth out of 15 teams in the tournament, just 10 strokes back of host and tournament champion Southern Illinois-Edwardsville. Belmont (849) and Tennessee-Martin (851) also finished ahead of the Bears, who finished three strokes ahead of South Dakota. \nBrauburger’s performance also earned him men’s golfer of the week honors by the Missouri Valley Conference. He currently ranks fourth in the conference with a 73.00 scoring average and has finished no worse than 14th in the Bears’ first three tournaments this fall, including a pair of top 10 finishes. \nPrep Tennis \nRogers Heritage 7, Springdale High 2 \nSingles \n1, Tony Kopek, Springdale, def.
