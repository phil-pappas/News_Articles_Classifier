With Jonathan Gray rushing for 103 yards and Heard adding 61, all they needed to do was control the clock as the UT defense consistently shut down the KSU offense.\nRELATED: Box score\nUT (3-4 overall, 2-2 in the Big 12) built a 16-0 lead midway through the second quarter on two touchdown runs by backup quarterback Tyrone Swoopes in the team’s short-yardage package. The Longhorns had multiple opportunities to put the game away early, but several promising scoring drives stall near midfield.\nKSU (3-4, 0-4) scored its only points of the first half on a 7-yard pass from Joe Hubener to Dominique Heath. With four minutes left in the fourth quarter, they gained possession with a chance to tie the score, but UT’s Dylan Haines intercepted an ill-advised Hubener lob to end the threat.\nThree plays later, Swoopes scored his third touchdown with 1:47 left.\nmfinger@express-news.net\ntwitter.com/mikefinger", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844638/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844646/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844644/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844649/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844651/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/26/8844687/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844647/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844636/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844644/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844639/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/26/8844687/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844648/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844639/3/920x920.jpg", "http://player.performgroup.com/eplayer.js#d3cb25252602823516c4eb08c1.1hmezlz1jwowm10dzie3rtek1x.s", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844648/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844635/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844650/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844649/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844638/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844651/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844635/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://chron.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510240083&home=83&vis=21", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844650/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844646/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844636/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/25/8844647/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:03:07.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
