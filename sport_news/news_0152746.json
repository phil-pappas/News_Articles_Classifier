Kevin Love is eager to get back on the floor — perhaps even in time for the Cavaliers' opener on Oct. 27. About six months after a shoulder dislocation ended his playoff run in the first round last season, Love feels optimistic about the start of this one.\nAdChoices “I feel pretty good,” Love told Sporting News. “As far as the opener goes, I am not completely sure. I’ll probably get with the doctors and see what they have to say. I know that my six-month post-op is coming up here pretty fast. As far as getting the strength back, getting the range of motion, I feel pretty good, so I am looking forward to getting into some more contact, getting into a rhythm and getting out there as quickly as I can.”\nMORE: 4 East teams with a shot at beating Cavs | Love initially refuses apology from Celtic who injured his shoulder\nLove has been cleared for 3-on-3 practices, but not yet for 5-on-5. If it were up to him, he’d be back on the court, but he understands he needs to follow the rehab protocol for his injury.\n“(Six months is) just a ballpark figure that has generally been thrown out there by anybody who has talked about the rehab process for this kind of an injury,” Love said. “I like to think that I am ahead of the game, but there’s different tests and the due diligence that the doctor will go through and the training staff will go through. So all I can do is go out there every day and attack my rehab and hopefully I will be able to go out there and help these guys as soon as possible.”\nOf course, which guys he will be helping out remains a question. The Cavs are also dealing with injuries to Kyrie Irving and Iman Shumpert, with big man Tristan Thompson still a contract holdout.\nEven when all are healthy, the hope is that Love will take on a bigger offensive role in Cleveland, after averaging 16.4 points and 9.7 rebounds last year, down from the 26.1 points and 12.5 rebounds he posted the previous year in Minnesota. Both LeBron James and coach David Blatt have said they plan to utilize Love more.\nAsked if he has already started to plan for that bigger role or if he will just let it develop in time, Love said, “I think a little bit of both. I think when I really jump back into things and I am cleared for full contact and I get out there 5-on-5, maybe get into some preseason games, I don’t know, then I will start thinking about that stuff, and really see where I fit into things and how I can help this team right away. When we get all of our guys back, everybody gets to full strength, we’re off and running.”\nLove was speaking in connection with his partnership with the Shock Doctor mouthguards he has been wearing. Around the NBA, mouthguards have become more popular, and Love said he hopes that younger players pick up on that.\n“I think, growing up, you tend not to wear them because you don’t think they’re cool,” he said. “I can’t tell you why that is, but I think it is moving toward a younger demographic, actually wearing mouthguards that fit them and protect them. I partnered with Shock Doctor to teach young athletes to protect themselves on the field or court. I have had adult braces and kind of done everything to protect my teeth throughout my time at UCLA and in the NBA. I wish I’d done it in high school and earlier.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656868-nba-contenders-of-the-east-conference-cavs-lebron-bulls-heat-hawks", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2015-05-07/kevin-love-kelly-olynyk-ignoring-phone-calls-shoulder-injury", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:24:12.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
