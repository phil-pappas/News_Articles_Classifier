In a scene that looked all so familiar to northeast Louisiana fans whose teams had the misfortune of encountering #4 from Neville the past four years, KaVontae Turpin introduced himself to the college football world Saturday afternoon. Turpin caught six passes for 138 yards and four touchdowns as TCU celebrated homecoming with a 50-7 thrashing of Texas. Turpin's TD grabs covered 13, 49, 50 and 12 yards. On hand for an official visit, Bastrop wide receiver Isaiah Graham was able to witness Turpin's exploits first-hand. Neville head coach Mickey McCarty and several assistants also made the trip to Fort Worth. A look at how some former Bastrop Rams faired in the professional and college ranks over the weekend: RUEBEN RANDLE caught a touchdown pass for the second straight week as the New York Giants carved out a 24-10 victory at Buffalo on Sunday. Randle's 11-yard reception from Eli Manning put the Giants up 16-3 with 10:42 remaining in the first half. Randle finished the afternoon with three catches for 31 yards as the Giants evened their record at 2-2. Returning home Sunday night, the Giants meet the San Francisco Giants at 7:30 p.m. MARSHAY GREEN was credited with one tackle as the SaskatchewanRoughriders fell to the British Columbia Lions in Saturday's Canadian Football League action. DENZEL DEVALL was in on two tackles as Alabama crushed Georgia on Saturday afternoon in Athens. Alabama (4-1, 1-1 SEC) hosts Arkansas on Saturday at 6 p.m. in Tuscaloosa. JAY WILSON snared a 53-yard touchdown pass as Central Arkansas cruised past Abilene Christian 42-14 Saturday in Conway, Arkansas. Wilson's second touchdown reception of the season gave the Bears an 18-0 lead with three seconds remaining in the first quarter of their home opener. Wilson leads the Bears' receiving chart with 21 catches for 230 yards. UCA (4-1, 1-1) continues Southland Conference play Saturday at Houston Baptist. JEVANTE WATSON recorded one tackle and broke up a pass in Louisiana-Lafayette's 43-14 loss to Louisiana Tech on Saturday night in Ruston. The Ragin' Cajuns (1-3) open Sun Belt Conference play at home vs. Texas State on Saturday at 6 p.m. RECRUITING NOTE: Bastrop High defensive end/outside linebacker Travez Moore is scheduled to take an official visit to South Carolina this weekend.
