And in the opener against St. Louis Sherman played nickelback throughout.

He entered Thursday with 14 receptions for 323 yards, an average of more than 23 per reception \nIt worked early, as Smith did not have a catch and San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick was held to 8-of-13 passing for 44 yards. Lynch ill early \nAfter Marshawn Lynch had nine carries for 38 yards to key the Seahawks’ touchdown drive on their opening possession, he took the next series off. \nAnd he spent much of it vomiting into a garbage can on the sideline while dealing with an upset stomach. \nCBS, which televised the game,reported that it was the same ailment that has struck Lynch before, though usually before games \nLynch memorably sat out early at Arizona last season, a game he then punctuated with a 79-yard run. \nLynch returned after the first play of Seattle’s third possession. \nThomas Rawls filled in while Lynch was ill. Wilson, Lockett finally connect \nIn both games the past two weeks, quarterback Russell Wilson just missed on a deep pass to rookie receiver Tyler Lockett, including in overtime of the loss at Cincinnati. \nBut the two finally connected in the second quarter as Lockett got behind cornerback Tramaine Brock and caught a 43-yard pass in stride in the end zone for the first receiving touchdown of his career. \nWilson faked a handoff to Lynch on the play and rolled back to the left to hit Lockett, who had earlier scored touchdowns on a punt return and a kickoff return. \nLockett led the Seahawks with three catches for 71 yards in the first half. Defensive-line depth a little thin \nDemarcus Dobbs was among the Seahawks’ seven inactive players, leaving them again a little thin on the defensive line. \nDobbs had been listed as questionable because of a shoulder injury suffered in the win over Chicago but was not able to go, joining defensive tackle Jordan Hill (quad injury) on the inactive list. \nDobbs returned last week against Carolina but had missed the previous two games. \nWith those two out, among those getting more time to help fill in was rookie Frank Clark, who made the biggest impact of his young career early. \nAlso among the inactive players was fullback Derrick Coleman, who is sidelined after suffering a concussion in a car accident last week ago. \nAlso inactive for the Seahawks were CB Marcus Burley (thumb), LB Nick Moody (ankle), C Patrick Lewis (knee/ankle) and OL Mark Glowinski. Glowinski was the only the healthy inactive player. Also among the active players was center Lemuel Jeanpierre, re-signed to the team this week. \nAmong Seattle’s eight active offensive linemen was Kristjan Sokoli. He was active last week against Carolina for the first time in his career. Notes \n• The Seahawks wore their alternate Wolf Grey uniforms for the first time this season. The Seahawks can wear those uniforms twice a season. Seattle was 5-0 in those uniforms entering Thursday. They debuted in 2012, including a win over the 49ers here last year. \n• The game marked the end of a stretch of four games in 18 days for the Seahawks, which began with the Monday night win over Detroit. Seattle enters a stretch of four games in 38 days. \n• The Seahawks’ touchdown on their opening drive was the second time this season they have scored on their first possession. The other came against Cincinnati. The other five opening drives resulting in punts. Bob Condotta: 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com .
