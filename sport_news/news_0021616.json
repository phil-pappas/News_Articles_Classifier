Mahomes' health\nMahomes appeared to be back at full strength while helping lead Texas Tech to its first win in Big 12 play this season. The sophomore quarterback suffered a 'lower-leg injury' in the first quarter of Texas Tech's 55-52 loss to TCU.\nHead coach Kliff Kingsbury did not disclose any specifics of Mahomes' injury, but did confirm he would start against Iowa State earlier in the week.\nKingsbury's decision was justified as Mahomes finished with 428 yards and five touchdowns, including a pass to Mesquite-native Jakeem Grant, in which Mahomes twice evaded a defender before finding Grant for a 75-yard score.\nPatrick Mahomes escapes third down pressure to deliver this absolute strike to Jakeem Grant. http://t.co/ZeLZA7X0KA\nâ” Big 12 Conference (@Big12Conference) October 10, 2015 2. Chunk plays on display\nTexas Tech's offense functions at its highest efficiency when rattling off plays of 10 or more yards.\nEntering the Iowa State matchup, the Red Raiders were tied for the most plays gaining 30-plus yards (23) among FBS teams while leading the nation in plays gaining 40-plus yards (15). Texas Tech's offense added to that total with seven plays gaining at least 30 yards and three plays - all touchdowns - tallying at least 40 yards each.\nOffensive production is not an area of concern for the Red Raiders, as five of the six chunk plays resulted in touchdowns.\nGrant was the biggest benefactor of the offensive explosion, gaining at least 10 yards on three of his nine catches. The senior finished with nine catches for 166 yards and two touchdowns.\n3. Rushing attack\nTexas Tech's performance on the ground balanced the Red Raiders in their winning effort.\nDespite losing right guard Justin Murphy last week to injury, Texas Tech's offensive line controlled things at the line of scrimmage. The Red Raiders rushed for 261 yards and three touchdowns, including 101 yards for sophomore running back Justin Stockton.\nStockton broke free for a 54-yard touchdown in the third quarter to put the Red Raiders ahead 45-24 and in a position to coast to victory.\nWATCH: Justin Stockton. Paydirt. #WreckEm http://t.co/UbdJhNMk2x\nâ” TechGameday (@TechGameday) October 10, 2015 Although the Red Raiders will be without Murphy for the foreseeable future, their performance against Iowa State demonstrated the senior leadership along this offensive line will not allow an injury to be an excuse or distraction.\n4. Secondary searching for consistency\nMany teams would struggle to contain the high-powered passing attacks of TCU and Baylor which is why Texas Tech needed to re-establish consistency in its secondary against Iowa State.\nTevin Madison intercepted Sam Richardson on Iowa State's opening possession and Texas Tech's offense answered by putting together a scoring drive capped by a 7-yard touchdown run from senior DeAndre Washington.\nOn the following Iowa State drive, Richardson connected with Quenton Bundrage on a 33-yard touchdown pass and the Red Raiders were back at square one.\nHowever, senior defensive back and Irving Nimitz-grad J.J. Gaines helped Tech's cause by intercepting Richardson in the third quarter for the quarterback's second interception of the day. Gaines intercepted Richardson again in the fourth quarter for his second pick of the day. Iowa State's quarterback passed for 139 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions.\n5. Low penalty count\nMinimizing penalties was a summer goal for Texas Tech as the Red Raiders were the most penalized team in the Big 12 last season. Head coach Kliff Kingsbury wanted his team to limit the mental mistakes he felt contributed to Texas Tech's 4-8 campaign last season.\nAfter being penalized 17 times against Baylor last week - the most flags Texas Tech has drawn this season - the Red Raiders responded with a fairly clean performance against Iowa State. Only seven penalties were called against Tech - 11 total. The Red Raiders will need to continue avoiding mental mistakes as the week-to-week competition increases.\nFollow Mike DuPont on Twitter: @MikeDuPont_\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/scoreboard.asp?conf=1a%3A071", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/WreckEm?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_", "https://twitter.com/TechGameday/status/652970068796510208", "https://twitter.com/Big12Conference/status/652954374302334976", "http://t.co/UbdJhNMk2x", "http://t.co/ZeLZA7X0KA"], "published": "2015-10-11T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:27:42.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
