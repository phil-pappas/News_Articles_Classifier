The third-year coach thought Smith made achievable strides in his first career start against the No. 13 defense in the nation.\nSmith had platooned with redshirt freshman Troy Flutie after starter Darius Wade suffered a fractured left ankle Sept. 18 against Florida State. The inherent flaws in game planning for two quarterbacks were exposed and exploited in consecutive ACC low-scoring losses to Duke and Wake Forest.\nSmith completed 7-of-22 for 88 yards in a controlled passing game. He showed tremendous dexterity avoiding the Tigers’ relentless pass rush and made good decisions with the football on broken plays.\nSmith gave BC a 7-0 lead on a 4-yard touchdown pass to fullback Bobby Wolford with 8:13 to play in the first. He scored the game’s final points on a 1-yard rush with 1:29 to play in the fourth.\n“I think (Smith) did a great job as far as handling the atmosphere and we all stuck together to fight the atmosphere,” junior tailback Myles Willis, who led the BC ground game with 88 yards on 15 carries, said. “He prepared all week so we were prepared for it.\n“I’m sure this is what he’s dreamed and once your dreams become a reality you don’t have time to be nervous.”\nSmith also gained a real-time perspective on what it takes to be a successful quarterback in the ACC. Clemson sophomore Deshaun Watson eviscerated the top-ranked defense in the country with an undetectable fusion of short, intermediate and deep passes.\nWatson completed 27-of-41 passes for 420 yards and three touchdowns with two interceptions. Sophomore wide receiver Artavis Scott was Watson’s primary target with 10 receptions for 162 yards and touchdown.\n“They are very electrifying in the pass game so we knew they were going to try and throw the ball around today,” senior free safety Justin Simmons, who finished with nine tackles and an interception that set the Eagles up for their first touchdown, said. “I don’t want to justify a loss, but I do see improvement on both sides of the ball and we just have to get back to work.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:46:27.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
