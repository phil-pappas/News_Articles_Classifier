Boise State (6-2, 3-1), humbled in its worst Mountain West Conference loss in school history a week ago, needed the win to keep pace with Mountain Division-leading Utah State. Wyoming (1-7, 1-3), which notched its first victory last week, suffered its largest defeat of the season. The Cowboys’ Brian Hill, who entered the game ranked fourth in the nation in rushing, eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark for the season and became the fastest to reach that plateau in school history. However, Boise State’s defense held Hill well below his 140.7 yards per game average, limiting him to 76 yards on 23 carries. Wyoming mustered only 233 yards, its lowest output of the season. Rypien’s night started more positively than a week ago when he was 6-of-15 passing with two interceptions and two lost fumbles in the first five possessions during the Broncos’ 52-26 loss to Utah State. Against Wyoming, Rypien completed 13 of his first 14 passes for 102 yards and two touchdowns in staking Boise State to an early lead. Rypien started the scoring by hitting Thomas Sperbeck on a 13-yard touchdown pass on the Broncos’ opening drive. Tyler Rausa’s 39-yard field goal pushed Boise State’s lead to 10-0, and McNichols bulled his way into the end zone on a 1-yard run. With 7:37 left in the second quarter, Rypien connected with McNichols for a 4-yard scoring strike to give the Broncos a 24-0 advantage. Wyoming scored its first points with less than a minute before halftime when Cam Coffman hit Jake Maulhardt for a 15-yard touchdown pass, cutting the deficit to 24-7. A 36-yard scoring pass from Rypien to Sperbeck along with a 28-yard field goal by Rausa gave Boise State a 34-7 lead late in the third quarter. Wyoming tried to fight back, but had to do so without Coffman, who left the field favoring his right shoulder and never returned. Backup quarterback Nick Smith engineered an 11-play, 83-yard drive that ended when he plowed into the end zone on a 6-yard run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:05:12.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
