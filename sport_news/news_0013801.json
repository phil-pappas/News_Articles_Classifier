Talladega is already one of the wildest, if not the wildest, tracks to run at Sprint Cup race. Now we have this scenario to consider.\nMORE: Logano wins, Kenseth sent spinning | Kyle Busch not a fan Think of the the Tazmanian Devil after a couple of Red Bulls. It'll be that fast and that wild and crazy.\nLogano also won last week in the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. That win already put him into the Eliminator Round of the Chase. Eleven other drivers will now try to grab one of the seven remaining spots in the Eliminator Round.\nThe winners of next Sunday's CampingWorld.com 500 (500,1 miles, 188 laps) will automatically qualify while the top six drivers in points who have not won one of the three Challenger Round races will advance.\nPHOTOS: 2015 Sprint Cup winners | Gordon's final season | Stockcar Toons\nHere’s a look at the Chase grid standings.\n1.
