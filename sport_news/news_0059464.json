( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nThe start of conference play this week provided Mountain View more than just a chance to begin its season anew after starting the year 2-3. \nIt also turned out to be an opportunity for the Mountain Lions to form a bit of a new identity. \nThe normally high-powered Lions found themselves in a rare low-scoring defensive struggle against visiting Silver Creek, and MVHS proved to be the stingier of the two Northern Conference foes with a 15-14 victory at Patterson Stadium. \n\"I couldn't be happier. That's exactly what our defense needed,\" said Mountain View coach Bart Mayes, whose team snapped a two-game skid. \"They came through with some big, big plays for us. Silver Creek, we knew it was going to be a dogfight and a battle. They're well coached. I'm just proud of our kids. We'll enjoy the first win in conference for sure.\" Mountain View running back Tommy Hochheimer scores the go-ahead touchdown in fourth quarter Thursday night in his team's 15-14 win over Silver Creek. ( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nAfter trailing by five at halftime, the Lions (3-3, 1-0) shut out the Raptors (1-5, 0-1) in the second half and took the lead for good on a 32-yard touchdown run by Tommy Hochheimer midway through the fourth quarter. \nIt was the junior back's 18th carry of the game, with his previous high going for 9 yards in the first half. But the dedication to the run game paid off, as Hochheimer appeared to be stopped for a short gain before breaking through for the decisive score. \n\"I knew I had to make something happen. Coach Mayes' father (Tom Mayes) came up to me and said, 'You've got to make a big play.' So it was just instinct, I guess; I don't know,\" said Hochheimer, who had 22 carries for 74 yards. \"I'm pretty sure I got hit by two guys, then I just bounced back and ran for the pylon.\" Advertisement \nAs big as the go-ahead score was, the Lions still had work left with more than 8 minutes remaining on the clock against a Silver Creek team armed with a very capable kicker. \nBut like it did all night, the MVHS defense stood tall, forcing an initial three-and-out on the ensuing series before a turnover on downs to clinch it, a stop that ended with back-to-back sacks by Braden Barker and Clayton McCall, followed by one from Isaac Adamson. \nFollowing a second-quarter touchdown by Silver Creek — a 16-yard pass from Anthony Kasper to Anthony Allman that gave the Raptors a 14-9 lead — Mountain View held Silver Creek scoreless on five straight possessions. The Lions held the Raptors to 264 yards of offense in the game, with more than half that total coming from Kasper's 153 rushing yards on 27 carries. \nBarker was among the biggest reasons for the second-half shutout, called into action in the third quarter after an injury to Mike Felton, who up to that point had been the unit's leader. \n\"It feels amazing just having the chance to get my shot. I wanted to step up, and hopefully I did my job,\" said Barker, who before Thursday was mainly a special teams player. \"There's 11 players on the field. You do your job, and everything's all good.\" \nMVHS quarterback Dennis Landry helped keep the Lions within striking distance all night, finishing 11-for-19 for 172 yards with one touchdown and one interception. \nThe score went to Jordan Kress for 39 yards in the final minute of the first quarter to give the Lions a 9-7 lead. Kress finished as the team's leading receiver with three catches for 68 yards to go with 46 yards rushing. Landry hit five different receivers on the night as Dakota Sedillo, Reid Nichols and Jason Rios each had at least two receptions. \nThe first possessions for both teams were mirror images, a long drive stalling deep inside the opposition's territory. The only difference was Mountain View made its field goal, a 27-yarder by Ivan Thomas, and Silver Creek missed its, a 25-yard try by Sean Peskin. \nThomas' kick began a stretch in which the two teams combined to score 16 points in the final 1:25 of the first quarter. Kasper gave the Raptors their initial lead when he took a run 65 yards around the end for a score on the first play of a drive to make it 7-3. But the Lions answered with the Kress touchdown, set up earlier in the drive by a 30-yard catch by Sedillo. \nMountain View plays again on Thursday night next week, remaining home to host Fort Collins and looking for a 2-0 start to conference play. \n\"We took it as we had our preseason five games and we learned a lot about ourselves, learned some things we do well and lot of things we need to fix,\" Mayes said. \"We're admitting it, fixing it and not repeating it. Hopefully we'll keeping that going on these last four games in conference.\" \nSean Star: 970-669-5050, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/seanvstar \n\nMountain Lions 15, Raptors 14 \nAt Silver Creek Silver Creek (1-5) 7 7 0 0 — 14 Mountain View (3-3) 9 0 0 6 — 15 \nFirst quarter \nMVHS — Ivan Thomas 27 field goal, 1:25 SCHS — Anthony Kasper 65 run (Sean Peskin kick), 1:14.
