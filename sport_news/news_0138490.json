The Wayne Hills crowd was buzzing in anticipation. And celebration time was quickly approaching, with a bench anxiously waiting to erupt. \nBut then came Meghan Griffin, nearly in tears, limping off softly to the sideline. \nThe Patriots’ senior star was in obvious pain, despite a right leg heavily wrapped and taped. Her team was clinging to a one-goal lead. But the nagging hip injury suffered in a game Oct. 8, was too much to bear. \nPrior to her final removal from Saturday’s Passaic County girls soccer tournament final, though, the talented forward left her mark on yet another county title game, as the Patriots persevered in a hard-fought 2-1 victory over rival Clifton. \nAlthough Griffin may have been in discomfort throughout — as she’s been for the past two and a half weeks — she sure didn’t look it. \nGriffin assisted on Johnna Caporuscio’s goal in the first half (set up by a perfect lead pass down the right sideline from Callen Vander May). \nShe then struck the brilliant game-winner in traffic inside the box with 8:27 left to play. Those two plays lifted Wayne Hills to its third straight county championship and Passaic County-best 12th overall, while ending Clifton’s (14-1-1) undefeated season. \n“It’s definitely killing me right now,” Griffin said of her hip, as teammate Lynnea Kolpon (who assisted on the winning goal) stood by her side. \n“But it’s definitely worth it. It might hurt, but I’ll play through it because there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to win this county championship. When you see the ball hit the net on a goal like that, there’s honestly no better feeling.” \nBut it’s one she has experienced before. Two years ago, Griffin’s goal in the 47th minute — against Clifton in a 1-0 2013 PCT final win — that began the county three-peat. \n“Meg has really come alive here in the last week or so,” Wayne Hills coach Gregg Rehberger said of Griffin, who scored both goals in the 2-0 semifinal win over Wayne Valley. \n“She’s really turned it on and has been scoring some big and important goals for us. Our offense goes as she goes and when she’s not scoring, we struggle.” \nRehberger admitted his team didn’t play its best Saturday, particularly in the second half. The Patriots “didn’t attack” the way they wanted to, but a tough Clifton defense factored into that. \nAfter Wayne Hills controlled the first 40 minutes, Clifton flipped the script after halftime. And with 29:07 left, the Mustangs’ Daniella LoBue scored a highlight-reel goal from the left side of the box to tie the score. \n“My heart literally stopped after the goal,” Griffin said, now laughing. “But we just took it as motivation. Our tempo turned up and we knew we had to finish the game. We weren’t going to lose. We had to get what we deserved.” \nAs if the stakes weren’t high enough, the Patriots exacted a bit of revenge Saturday. Hills fell to Clifton, 2-1, in double-overtime in a regular season game Oct. 1. \nThe players said that defeat was only slightly used as motivation and Rehberger added that the teams’ meeting helped more from “a strategic standpoint.” \n“I don’t think you need to add much to this game the way this rivalry has been going the past few years,” Rehberger said. “It’s going to be tough no matter what and no matter who you’re playing in a county final.” \nTied at 1 with time winding down in the second half, Kolpon said with a laugh that Rehberger reminded the Patriots that “nothing’s worse than losing a county final, but nothing’s even worse than being co-champions.” \nKolpon and Griffin didn’t want that. And the seniors who have been playing together since sixth grade proceeded to team up for the game-winner. \n“When we walked off the bus [before the game], we all said we’d be coming back on it as county champions,” Kolpon said. “We did it again.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:21:32.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
