He stood out during the Hawks’ stay at Notre Dame but was sidelined with an upper-body injury until returning to practice Friday, leaving questions about whether he belongs.\n“Great question. We’ve got to see more,” coach Joel Quenneville said. “Watching him, there’s a certain level of skill there and ability. He’s fun to watch and so he gets an opportunity. Maybe it wasn’t like the other ones but certainly I think his history, he earned that. I think that’s part of it.”\nReportedly, part of the Hawks’ two-year deal with Panarin includes a clause that would allow him to return to Russia’s KHL if he’s not in the NHL, perhaps precluding a trip to Rockford he might need for seasoning.\nQuenneville said he hasn’t talked about that with Panarin.\n“I just know that I think a number of teams were in the mix of trying to sign him,” Quenneville said. “I know that highly recruited and highly sought. We were very happy at the time and then watching him play. We’re still happy and excited.”\nPatrick Kane , who was with Panarin and Artem Anisimov at Saturday’s morning skate, said: “I think it will be good to try and get some chemistry with him and Anisimov and hopefully he’ll do some good things out there tonight, give him some confidence going into Wednesday.”\nComing along\nMarcus Kruger got a late start in training camp after a visa issue delayed his arrival in the United States. Though he skated in Sweden while he waited for his immigration hurdles to be cleared, Kruger wasn’t able to practice with his teammates and had appeared in just one preseason game entering Saturday.\nQuenneville said his timing with the puck, stick positioning and faceoffs will need to get better when the season starts. That said, he isn’t worried about his dependable fourth-line center.\n“He’s one guy, to me, you don’t have to really worry too much about,” Quenneville said.\nIn brief\nGoaltender Michael Leighton was assigned to Rockford before Saturday’s game. After that move, the roster is down to 25 with 13 forwards, nine defensemen (including the injured Michal Rozsival and Kyle Cumiskey ) and two goalies, essentially setting it for opening night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:01:12.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
