It was a tremendous atmosphere, I can’t thank the fans enough. That was a big-time crowd to play in front of.”\nUSU head coach Matt Wells\nLOGAN — The best thing about winning a game following a short week is you have a little extra time to savor the victory.\nAnd make no mistake, Utah State's 52-26 bludgeoning of Boise State Friday night will be enjoyed by the Aggies and their fans throughout this weekend  and for decades to come.\nNot only did the Aggies (3-0 in the Mountain West, 4-2 overall) finally manage to beat the No. 21 Broncos (2-1, 5-2) for the first time since 1997 — a span of a dozen games — but the manner in which Utah State dismantled the Mountain West's top program was downright historic in nature.\nThanks to seven BSU turnovers in the first half, the Aggies headed into halftime with an extremely unlikely lead of 45-10.\n“What an unbelievable performance by our players,” USU head coach Matt Wells said after the game. “It was a tremendous atmosphere, I can’t thank the fans enough. That was a big-time crowd to play in front of. The juice and the energy felt from the fans affected our players. It was an unbelievable night. I don’t know if I have ever seen anything like that first half.\n“The key to the game was obviously those turnovers and turning them into touchdowns. Both sides fed off each other’s energy and production. The stats are pretty even except for that one thing. We’ve been talking about it all week, I just didn’t know it was going to come like that. Hats off to our players. It was a tremendous job by our staff in gearing up for a tremendous opponent and program in a short week and having our guys ready to play. It was an unbelievable effort, and an unbelievable win for our program.”\nWhile Boise State entered Friday's showdown having committed just six turnovers in its first six games, the Broncos ended up turning the ball over seven times in the first half and eight times in the game. That is the highest turnover total for a BSU team since the program moved up to the FBS level in 1996, and the most committed by the Broncos since committing 12 at Montana in 1989.\nIn addition, the Broncos’ 35-point halftime deficit was its worst since trailing Louisiana Tech 42-0 at intermission during a game in 1998. And when the Aggies scored their inaugural touchdown midway through the first quarter to go up 7-3, it marked the first time that BSU had trailed an opponent since the end of its 35-24 loss at BYU on Sept. 12, a span of more than 247 minutes.\n“We did everything the same as we usually do,” BSU safety Darian Thompson said. “The locker room seemed fired up before the game. But when it started, they just came out with more fire.”\nUtah State came up with three interceptions and five fumble recoveries, turning them into 35 points. Sophomore quarterback Kent Myers, whose only loss as a starter came via a 50-19 blowout at Boise State last November, completed 17 of 24 passes for 157 yards and three touchdowns while also rushing for 63 yards and another TD on 14 carries.\n“It was amazing,” Myers said of the victory. “We’ve wanted to beat Boise State so bad since last year. We really wanted that revenge. We’ve been preaching that this isn’t the championship, but it puts us in the lead. We just have to battle it out, and that’s what we came in here and did.”\nWhile the Aggies ended up rushing for 177 yards, the Broncos, who were without the services of injured tailback Jeremy McNichols, totaled just 34 yards on 30 carries. The Utah State defense, which sacked freshman quarterback Brett Rypien four times, finished with 10 tackles for loss, thanks to big nights from linebackers Nick Vigil (10 tackles, 2.0 sacks, 2.5 TFLs) and Kyler Fackrell (11 tackles, 2.5 TFLs).\n“We knew how good they were,” Vigil said. “We saw what they did to us last year, and they return most of those guys aside from the running back. But our defensive line did a great job of holding the O-line, letting us linebackers scrape off to make tackles. It’s a great credit to those guys.”\nAfter enjoying their epic upset, it's on to San Diego State for the Aggies this Friday night. The Aztecs (2-0, 3-3) headed into Saturday night’s late clash at Western Division rival San Jose State (2-1, 3-3) having won two straight games against Fresno State and Hawaii after dropping three in a row to Cal, South Alabama and Penn State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:34:49.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
