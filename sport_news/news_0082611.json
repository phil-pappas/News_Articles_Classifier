Junior Erin Hartwell scored a goal in the 75th minute to give Dover (4-7-2) a huge 1-0 division I win over Nashua South (1-12-0). “It was definitely a big game because it was senior night,” Hartwell said. “Having the great crowd was a big motivation for us and it was definitely a great feeling scoring one for them.” Dover took control late, which eventually led to the winner. Maddie Cannon found Hartwell in the low box, and Hartwell hit it right into the middle portion of the net. It was actually a good few minutes for Hartwell and Cannon. The two connected twice with Hartwell having four shots and Cannon adding one of her own in the flurry. “The goal started off with a really good cross by Maddie (Cannon),” Hartwell said. “It was a big clump of girls in the middle and Abby chipped it over all of them. I somehow got it and one timed it in.” The Green Wave struggled with emotion at the start on Tuesday, as senior festivities led to jitters and uneven play. South carried the play for much of the early stages. Luckily for Dover, its opponent couldn’t take advantage of the chances early that could have put the game out of reach. “You never know what to expect on senior night,” Dover coach Jason Wisniewski said. “There is a lot of emotion involved. Trying to focus them on playing can sometimes be difficult. The girls did what they needed to today. We played hard, but didn’t play great. We were able to get the result we wanted and kind of needed in order to possibly advance into the tournament.” Dover came on as the half came on and evened up the shots late in the first half. The best opportunity of came in the 37th minute, when Maddie Cannon was taken down just above the box. Cannon was awarded a free kick and it sailed just high. Shots were 7-6 South in the half, but Dover had the last five towards goal. The second half began much as the first ended, with Dover controlling the ball and getting shots toward the goal. The best early opportunity came in the 47th minute. Hartwell sent a ball toward the front of the woodwork to a waiting Megan Morrison but it went off the top of her shooting foot and went high. The Panthers had great opportunities to give itself a victory midway through the second half. In the 55th minute, the visitors had the Wave scrambling in its own box. South got three shots off, with two of them being blocked. They were unable to find the ball cleanly to get a quality shot on net. The opportunity was one of many squandered on the night for the visiting team. “I think overall we probably carried the play more than they did,” Nashua south coach Tom Bellen said. “But you have to finish the chances that we had. That was a good opportunity for us that we didn’t bury it. They came down and they had their chance and they finished well. That happens in soccer. The win continued Dover’s unbeaten streak, which has now reached three games. The Wave picked up ties against Concord and Exeter, both in the top eight of the Division I standings, last week. The victory also kept its tournament hopes alive and they now sit in 12th place in the standings. “We have three games left, all on the road,” Wisniewski said. “Two of them are teams that are near us in the standings. Basically we control our own destiny, beat those teams and we are in. I would rather take care of it on our own than let others do it for us.” By Josh Seguin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:43:49.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
