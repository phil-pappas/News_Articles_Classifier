He struck out three and walked two. His 2.48 ERA is second in the league, and he leads the league with 232 innings and a 1.02 WHIP.\nCorrea had three hits and was a double short of the cycle. He scored four runs as the Astros scored in every inning but the fifth and the ninth. Rasmus had two hits and three RBIs and Valbuena had two doubles to go with his homer and two RBIs.\nAmerican League\nAngels 2, Rangers 1: Mike Trout scored the winning run after leading off the ninth with a triple, keeping the Los Angeles Angels’ playoff hopes alive by beating the Texas Rangers.\nThe Angels (84-76) were one game behind Houston starting the day in the race for the second wild-card spot. Minnesota also began the day tied with Los Angeles.\nThe loss kept the Rangers (87-73) from celebrating an American League West title before a sellout crowd of 47,219.\nTexas, already assured of a spot in the post-season, came into the game needing one win or a Houston loss to clinch the division.\nRoyals 3, Twins 1: A two-run rally in the eighth inning lifted the Kansas City Royals to a 3-1 win over the Minnesota Twins.\nThe loss is a potentially crippling blow for the Twins’ post-season hopes; Minnesota began the clash one-game behind the Houston Astros for the second wild card spot in the American League.\nRoyals right-hander Chris Young allowed just four hits and one run while he struck out five and walked two through 6-1/3 innings.\nBlue Jays 8, Rays 4: The Toronto Blue Jays rallied from a 4-1 deficit to score four runs in the sixth and three in the seventh and pull away for an 8-4 win against Tampa Bay.\nIndians 8, Red Sox 2: Carlos Santana had two hits and three RBIs while Josh Tomlin pitched into the seventh inning as the Cleveland Indians beat the Boston Red Sox.\nSantana’s three-run double was the big blow in a four-run third inning. Tomlin had only one hiccup in the 6-1/3 innings, a two-run home run by designated hitter David Ortiz in the fourth inning.\nHe gave up five hits with five strikeouts and two walks.\nIn other gmaes it was: White Sox 2, Tigers 1; Athletics 4, Mariners 2; Yankees vs. Orioles (postponed).\nNational League\nCu bs 6, Brewers 1: Jake Arrieta threw six shutout innings while Anthony Rizzo drove in three runs as the Cubs cruised to a 6-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.\nArrieta (22-6) held the Brewers to just two hits while striking out seven in a final tune-up before he takes the mound against Pittsburgh next Wednesday in the NL wild card game.\nRizzo hit his 31st home run of the season and added a two-run single in the fifth for Chicago, who also got two hits from second baseman Starlin Castro and shortstop Addison Russell.\nBraves 4, Cardinals 0: Julio Teheran allowed five hits over six scoreless innings in his last start of the year as the Braves blanked the National League Central champion St. Louis Cardinals.\nRookie second baseman Daniel Castro homered off Cardinals starter Jaime Garcia and finished 3-for-5 with two RBIs and two runs scored.\nPirates 6, Reds 4 (12 innings): Starling Marte’s two-run home run in the bottom of the 12th inning lifted the Pittsburgh Pirates to a 6-4 victory over Cincinnati, extending the Reds’ losing streak to 13 games.\nIt was the left fielder’s 19th home run of the season and third career walk-off shot. He also hit a game-ending homer on Aug. 22 against the San Francisco Giants.\nIn other games it was: Dodgers 6, Padres 2; Rockies 9, Giants 3; Marlins vs. Phillies and Nationals vs. Mets (postponed). — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:05:30.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
