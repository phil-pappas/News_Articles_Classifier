Strasburg hung tight taking the third match 25-23, and then Estes took control of their home court and dominated the final match, 25-17. \nThis win gives the Ladycats a 2-9 record in their Patriot League, 2-13 overall record. Strasbury went home with a 0-9 league record, finding themselves at the bottom of the patriot league. \n\"It is so awesome to finally see the team starting to play together as a team,\" Coach Kyra Stark said. \"They didn't give up, they were scrambling and full of energy.\" \nStark is happy with how things are progressing now that the team's new assistant coach Anna Weddle is on board and helping with her experience and skills. \n\"We are getting a lot more done now, it's been a blessing having her join as the assistant coach,\" said Stark. \nWeddle has some good experience with volleyball; she's been a player, she has coached for a few years prior to coming to Estes Park and her connection with some of the players as a youth pastor in the community has really given the girls an immediate connection to their new assistant coach. \nLeading the Ladycats, Ani Cirone is recognized for her leadership and strong playing. Kaylee Coleson has the most kills for the team and continues to dominate the front line, and Lindsey Kufeld is also a strong leader and playing very well.
