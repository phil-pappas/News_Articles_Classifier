(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) Sponsored Links The Associated Press \nFrom Carlos Correa to Adrian Gonzalez, baseball's sluggers are having quite a day. \nThere have been 20 home runs Monday, a record for one day in postseason play. The latest was a solo shot by Gonzalez in the seventh inning for the Los Angeles Dodgers in their NL Division Series game against the New York Mets. \nCorrea hit two of Houston's four homers against Kansas City, and the Chicago Cubs hit a postseason-record six home runs in their victory over St. Louis. Three of Toronto's first eight batters homered in an ALDS win at Texas. \nThe previous postseason record was 15 home runs on Oct. 3, 1995, according to STATS. Like Monday, there were four postseason games on that day 20 years ago.
