I’m not sure at this point either one can handle the whole game. My hope is quite honestly that one of them will make it a non-decision and we are just not there yet.”\nThe two passers collaborated on a home win over Northern Illinois and a loss at Duke. Flutie is a roll-out passer who has completed 18-of-29 throws for 318 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.\nSmith is a read-option runner who leads the team with 213 yards on 27 carries and three touchdowns. BC’s power run game will get a boost with the return of junior tailback Myles Willis, who missed last week’s game with a shoulder injury. The Eagles now have three healthy ball carriers in Tyler Rouse, Marcus Outlow and Willis in place of Jon Hilliman, who is out with a fractured foot.\nThe contrasting styles of Smith and Flutie puts the onus on Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson and defensive coordinator Mike Elko to devise difference defenses.\n“I think in a lot of ways you get ready for what Boston College does offensively,” Clawson said. “They have relative skill strengths but you’ve got to prepare for their offense.\n“They are both capable of running aspects of it. But each brings something a little different to the table.”\nThe Demon Deacons are dealing with a quarterback issue that could develop into a controversy. Clawson has gotten solid performances from true freshman Kendall Hinton, who replaced sophomore starter John Wolford (ankle) in Wake’s Sept. 19 win at Army. Wolford’s brother Bobby is the Eagles’ starting fullback and leading receiver with seven catches.\n“(Wolford’s) starting to practice a little bit and he looks like he’s starting to feel better,” Clawson said. “We’re just going to kind of take it day-by-day and figure out what we’ll do later in the week.”\nHinton passed for 245 yards in his first career start against Indiana, the most by a Deacons quarterback in a debut, and has rushed for 218 yards on 54 carries and four touchdowns.\n“They are breaking in a young quarterback and the new kid Kendall Hinton is more of a dual threat,” Addazio said. “They have played some pretty darn good teams and I think they are a work in progress on offense just like we are.\n“I think they will present some problems for our defense.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:39:30.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
