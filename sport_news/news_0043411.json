In Region 8-A, Prince Avenue Christian (14-6, 10-1) and Athens Christian (12-9, 8-3) appear to be poised to advance to state, while in Region 8-AAA, Oconee County (11-13, 8-4), Jackson County (16-10, 8-4) and East Jackson (18-7, 7-4) are among the league’s top three teams. \nTHURSDAY, OCT. 8 \nVolleyball: \nRegion 8-AAA tournament at Jefferson and Oconee County, 5 p.m. \nTop-seeded Oconee County will host a pair of matches and will face the winner of Morgan County (fourth seed) and Hart County (fifth seed) at 6 p.m. Jefferson, the region’s No. 2 seed, will play the winner of a preliminary match against the winner between No. 3 seed East Jackson and No. 6 seed Jackson County at 6 p.m. The semifinals and finals will be held Saturday at the Arena in Jefferson. \nSoftball: North Hall at Madison County, 4:30 p.m. \nThe Red Raiders (19-8, 7-1) are the No. 2 seed in the Region 8-AAAA tournament and will host North Hall (18-7, 8-2) in a doubleheader, with a third game, if necessary, set for 4:30 p.m. Friday. The region finals will be held Saturday at a to-be-determined location. \nFRIDAY, OCT. 9 \nFootball: \nPrince Avenue Christian at Athens Academy, 7: 30 p.m. \nThe area’s two best Class A teams will do battle for the 11th time, with both teams holding five victories each. Both teams are unbeaten and both the Wolverines (ranked No. 2 in Class A) and the Spartans are comfortably ensconced in the Class A Private power rankings. Prince Avenue Christian has won the last three meetings (limiting Athens Academy to but one touchdown in all three games) and has won five of the last six. \nFootball: Morgan County at Jefferson, 7:30 p.m. \nJefferson — ranked No. 3 in Class AAA — appeared to have little trouble dispatching Elbert County, which was ranked No. 4, at the Granite Bowl last Friday night, and the Dragons (6-0, 2-0 in Region 8-AAA) will host a Morgan County (3-2, 1-0) team that is on a three-game winning run. Though the Bulldogs hold an 11-5 edge in their all-time series with Jefferson, which dates back 67 years, the Dragons have won two in a row and three of the last four. \nFootball: Flowery Branch at Clarke Central, 7:30 p.m. \nThe Gladiators (2-3, 2-2 in Region 8- ) were off last weekend but face a gauntlet of tough region foes over the next three weeks. Flowery Branch (3-3, 2-2) unsuccessfully slugged it out with Winder-Barrow last Friday and has also lost to Lanier (5-0, 4-0). If Clarke Central has hopes for the postseason, the Glads have to make a good showing in the next three weeks, starting Friday. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:28:28.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
