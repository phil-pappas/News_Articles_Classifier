(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) Back Photo: 5 of 5 Next AP Phelan M. Ebenhack Associated Press \nWIN THE FIRST QUARTER \nTampa Bay has been outscored 38-6 in the first quarter this year. The minus-32 point differential is second-worst in the league, ahead of only Miami (37-3). San Francisco is minus-29 and the 49ers have yet to score a first-quarter point. The Jaguars have scored one opening-quarter touchdown this year. Getting an early lead could allow the Jaguars to throw different pressures at Jameis Winston (above). \nCONTINUED FIRST-DOWN TREND \nThe Jaguars’ offense averaged 5.8 yards a snap on first down at Indianapolis (32 plays, 187 yards), up from the woeful 3.1-yard rate at New England. On first down, the Jaguars had 17 positive plays, including passes of 26, 48 and 21 yards. The Jaguars rank 21st in yards per first down play (5.1) and Tampa Bay’s defense is 16th (5.33). Stay ahead of the sticks after first down and the Jaguars can use T.J. Yeldon more often. \nSOLVE THE PENALTY PROBLEM \nThe Jaguars have a penalty problem (their 324 yards are third-most in the NFL), but it’s minuscule compared to what’s going on in Tampa Bay. The Bucs have been called for 12, 11, 10 and five penalties in their games this year; their 46 is second-most. The Jaguars must eliminate the unforced errors — illegal formation, false start, offside, late-hit — if they are to become a competitive team. Might as well start Sunday. \nWHEN THE JAGUARS RUN \nOnly Miami and Cleveland are worse stopping the run than Tampa Bay (185.5 yards per game). The Bucs have allowed only one 100-yard rusher (Houston’s Alfred Blue had 139 in Week 3) and are middle-of-the-pack in yards per attempt (14th/4.0), but the Jaguars should have a chance to get T.J. Yeldon (right) his second straight 100-yard game. \nWHEN THE JAGUARS PASS \nTampa Bay’s secondary was without cornerback Johnthan Banks and safety Major Wright last week, but the Buccaneers are tied for second in fewest passing yards allowed per game (185.5). Veteran cornerback Tim Jennings is a heady player. A key to their defense is the pass-rushing duo of end Jacquies Smith (right, four sacks) and tackle Gerald McCoy (three sacks). \nWHEN THE BUCCANEERS RUN \nThe Jaguars rank fourth against the run (83 yards per game) and first in yards allowed per attempt (3.1). They were stout in shutting down Indianapolis save for Frank Gore’s 22-yard run in overtime that set up the game-winning field goal. Tampa Bay is 17th in rushing (107.3 per game), but Doug Martin (left) is averaging 4.3 yards per attempt. \nWHEN THE BUCCANEERS PASS \nJaguars’ opponents have combined for a 98.0 passer rating against the Jaguars. Tampa Bay presents two problems in receivers Vincent Jackson (left) and Mike Evans. They’ve been Winston’s intended target on 47.4 percent (63 of 133) of his attempts and a combined 29 catches for 425 yards and two touchdowns (both by Jackson). The Jaguars expect the Buccaneers to use quick-game and screen passes to keep Winston in-rhythm. \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nTampa Bay gets the edge because it acknowledged its kicker issue and released Kyle Brindza after he missed six field goals in the first four games. The Jaguars, meanwhile, are sticking with Jason Myers (7 of 10). The Buccaneers have a solid return man in Bobby Rainey (9.5 on punts, 29.9 on kicks) and are top 10 covering punts and kickoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:46:03.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
