Hardy makes Dez seem level-headed By HOWARD FENDRICHAP Pro Football Writer Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy (76) tackles New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning (10) during the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Oct. 25, 2015, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Kathy Willens) Browse for Republican American Reprints Greg Hardy managed to make Dallas Cowboys teammate Dez Bryant seem like the level-headed, peacemaker type.In an unusual, on-field, in-game lashing out, Hardy broke into a Cowboys special teams huddle after the unit allowed a 100-yard touchdown return in the fourth quarter of a 27-20 loss to the NFC East rival New York Giants.Hardy shoved at least one Dallas player. NBC's \"Football Night in America\" showed a video clip of Hardy slapping at special teams coach Rich Bisaccia's clipboard.\"I was a little surprised he was in there,\" Cowboys safety Danny McCray said.Hardy stomped around for a bit, then headed to the sideline, where he exchanged heated words with Bryant — still sidelined with a foot injury, the receiver was wearing a knit cap.In the locker room afterward Sunday, Hardy was not in the mood to discuss what happened, issuing a half-dozen or so variations of \"No comment.\"The defensive lineman was appearing in only his second game for the Cowboys; he missed this season's first four games while suspended under the NFL's personal conduct policy.He joined Dallas as a free agent after playing in only one game last season for the Carolina Panthers. Hardy was convicted last year of assaulting a former girlfriend; the charges later were dismissed after prosecutors said the accuser did not show up for a hearing.In case you missed it, here are the other top topics after the NFL's seventh Sunday:5 UNBEATENS: Carolina's 27-16 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night made the Panthers 6-0, the first time in NFL history five clubs won their first half-dozen games. New England also got to 6-0, beating the New York Jets 30-23, while three unbeatens were on a bye: Cincinnati, Denver and Green Bay. The Packers play at the Broncos next week, then at the Panthers the week after that.BUFFERING: The word \"buffering\" got a lot of use Sunday, when folks took to Twitter to register complaints about the occasional glitches they experienced while watching Yahoo's stream of Jacksonville's topsy-turvy 34-31 victory over Buffalo in London. If the NFL can get Yahoo — or anyone else — to pony up enough dollars, more games could be shown that way, instead of via television.NO LUCK: What is wrong with Andrew Luck? He returned last week from an injured throwing shoulder, but he still doesn't look like the guy who not too long ago was considered a budding superstar. The Colts are only 1-4 when Luck starts this season, including a 27-21 loss to New Orleans on Sunday. The QB opened that one with five straight incompletions and was intercepted twice before halftime.MARINO'S HEIR: While the No. 1 pick in the 2012 draft, Luck, is struggling, and the Redskins don't even allow the No. 2 selection that year, Robert Griffin III, to wear a uniform most Sundays, the guy who went No. 8, Ryan Tannehill, is playing his best football yet. Tannehill completed his first 18 passes — stretching his two-game streak to a record 25 completions in a row — and tossed four TDs in the first 16 minutes of Miami's 44-26 victory over Houston. \"I thought Marino walked out again,\" Dolphins interim coach Dan Campbell joked.HOT SEATS: Since Campbell replace the fired Joe Philbin, Miami is 2-0 and has outscored its opponents — OK, so the Titans and Texans aren't really, um, good — by a whopping 82-36. In addition to making Miami matter, Campbell's quick success could sway other teams' owners into a switch. So what coaches could be in trouble? Mike McCoy of San Diego (2-5 after what he termed a \"pathetic\" 37-29 loss to Oakland), Jim Caldwell of Detroit (1-6 after a 28-19 loss to Minnesota), or Chuck Pagano of Indianapolis (3-4, but 0-4 outside the AFC South).
