She could have appealed the decision to state District Court but didn’t.\nRiley had prepared appraisals of four neighboring properties in 2008 and set the fair market value of all the land at nearly $2 million.\nThe property owners, who had hired her, later conveyed the property to an Albuquerque private school but ran into problems when they tried to use the appraisals to obtain a state income tax credit for land that is transferred for preservation or conservation.\n“I was reprimanded. I paid the fine,” Riley said, adding that the case was the first and last disciplinary procedure brought against her by the Board of Real Estate Appraisers.\nRiley’s licensing file shows no other disciplinary cases, and records of disciplinary cases before the board show that sanctions are generally less severe if cases are settled prior to hearings.\nDunn, who took office Jan. 1, announced in April that he had hired Riley as assistant commissioner for commercial resources. Dunn appointed Riley acting deputy land commissioner after his first top aide, former Questa Mayor Bobby Ortega, left after four months in the job. Riley has since been given the job on a permanent basis.\nRiley said the Land Office, which manages 9 million surface acres and 13 million acres of subsurface, has an appraiser on staff and that she isn’t involved in overseeing that person’s work. She is paid $100,000 a year as deputy commissioner.\nBefore being hired by Dunn, Riley was involved on behalf of herself and other private parties in several transactions with the Land Office, including commercial development of state lands, property swaps and a lease of state land for grazing. She also worked for the Land Office in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nRiley said she has no financial interest in any ongoing relationship between the Land Office and a private party. She said she continues to work as an appraiser and real estate broker but wouldn’t accept any private work involving the Land Office.\nAsked about the disciplinary case against Riley and her hiring, Dunn said in a written statement that Riley “has proven to be a great asset to the State Land Office.”\nDunn also said, “I hired Laura Riley based on her extensive experience in real estate, land use management in New Mexico and business. I knew she was well respected in these industries and qualified for the job.”\nAppraisal history\nThe disciplinary case against Riley stemmed from appraisals of land near Corona. Each of the four tracts was about 140 acres, and each was given an appraised value of about $490,000.\nThe landowners transferred the properties to Sandia Preparatory School, then sought a state income tax credit that is available to property owners who convey land for conservation or preservation. The tax credit is based on the fair market value of conveyed land, and the appraisals conducted by Riley were forwarded to the state Department of Taxation and Revenue for review.\nReviewers for Tax and Revenue rejected the appraisals, saying Riley “did not reach a reasonable conclusion concerning value” of the properties. The reviewers said they were concerned that Riley, in identifying comparable land sales, had considered some sales that she shouldn’t have and excluded others that should have been taken into account.\nOne of the reviewers for Tax and Revenue, who was a licensed appraiser, filed a complaint in 2009 with the Regulation and Licensing Department, the parent agency of the Board of Real Estate Appraisers. The board’s notice of contemplated action against Riley said the land values in the appraisals were “unsupported and grossly overstated.”\nRiley denied making errors other than a minor mathematical mistake. An appraiser hired by the board to conduct a peer review of the appraisals found that Riley had been careless, lacked understanding of certain appraisal techniques and had omitted significant data.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_08oct_deputy-e1444280427401-132x175.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:07:47.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
