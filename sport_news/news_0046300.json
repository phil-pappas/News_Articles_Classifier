It can’t happen again.”\nIt is here where we trot out the spread is dead and long live big boy football mantra after Alabama’s 41-23 victory, the easy out for another big game the Tide swallowed whole. But doing so would only diminish the enormity of what happened, and the beautiful symphony of a champion staggering but never wavering, stumbling but never falling.\nWelcome, everyone, to playing with everything on the line. Week after week, game after game.\nThe scary part: A month after a home loss to Ole Miss essentially left Alabama in win-or-walk mode for the College Football Playoff, the Tide still aren’t playing their best football.\n“We’re not a finished product by any means,” said Alabama quarterback Jake Coker. “We have to stay alive. It doesn’t get more simple than that.”\nIf we’ve learned one thing from this Alabama team halfway through the season it is this: they’re not the best team in coach Nick Saban’s nine years in Tuscaloosa, but they might be the most resilient.\nThey’re not the offensive precision of Baylor, or the defensive might of Michigan. They’re not quarterback-centric like TCU, or pressuring the quarterback like Utah.\nThey’re not the glitz and glamour of Ohio State and Texas A&M. They are, more than anything, the one team in the nation with no pretenses.\nThey’re flawed, they know it and they compensate for it by grinding out big wins in big games like no one else — all while knowing one more SEC loss ends the season.\n“There are a lot of things we can fix, a lot of things we can do better,” Saban said. “We still haven’t played our best game.”\nWHAT WE LEARNED: Michigan-Michigan State | Baylor | Iowa\nAnd they’re still a long way from a finished product, one that has less than a month before LSU comes to town in the defacto SEC West Division title game.\nThe offense is one-dimensional and the defense has no identity, other than a propensity to turn interceptions into touchdown s. Four times in the last three games, Tide defensive backs have done just that — and freshman cornerback Minkah Fitzpatrick did it twice against the Aggies.\nThey practice interception returns every week: everyone on defense run to the closest outside number and block.\n“The best way to get a big play,” Saban said.\nIt happened a school-record three times on three horribly thrown balls; three gifts that Alabama turned into touchdowns and used to outscore its own offense. What could be wrong with that?\n“I was giving it to (Tide offensive coordinator Lane) Kiffin about that,” Ragalnd said. “We’ll get better on offense. We have all the confidence in the world in them.”\nThere is no “them” in the Alabama offense; only “him” — bruising tailback Derrick Henry. At some point this season, some team may figure out how to stop Henry (32 carries, 236 yards, 2 TD). Until then, Alabama’s offense will continue to be one-dimensional, an understated here-it-comes, try-and-stop-it running game and a quarterback who does absolutely nothing special — but does just about everything they ask of him.\nSaban likes to think of his team as an NFL organization. This Alabama team, maybe the least equipped to win a championship since his first team that lost to Louisiana-Monroe at home, is a walking, talking version of an NFL team: games are either laughers, or it’s the fourth quarter and someone has to make a play.\nBut here’s the difference between Alabama and just about everyone else in college football: someone usually does.\nFrom Henry’s punishing running to a secondary that doesn’t necessarily cover well but can catch an interception — and then figure out how to get to the end zone (four pick sixes in the last three games). There’s something comforting about a team with so many flaws — how can Alabama have a passing game with no consistent threat on the outside? — that continues to live in the moment and push back at every turn since an unthinkable home loss to Ole Miss.\nThey sucked the air out of the big game in Athens, taking Georgia’s hot, efficient passing game and turning it into an utter mess. They clamped down on an Arkansas team with new life, and held them to 220 total yards.\nThen they strolled into this expansive, expensive moshpit; this shrine to all things bigger in Texas, and made the Aggies buckle and bend on a knee 15 minutes into the game. It wasn’t always pretty (4 for 16 third downs), and it wasn’t anything like the Alabama teams of the past.\nBut at this point, with so much riding on every game, maybe we should just sit back and enjoy the ride. And watch the carnage.\n“But we can’t keep making it interesting,” Ragland said.\nOne step away from getting better. One step away from losing it all.\nMaybe playing with everything on the line isn’t so bad after all.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658524-alabama-beats-texas-am-nick-saban-derrick-henry-jake-coker-kyle-allen-sec-west", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfzapc.img&quot;}}", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658517-michigan-state-beats-michigan-blocked-punt-jim-harbaugh-what-we-learned", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Preview:", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658496-iowa-northwestern-jordan-canzeri-kirk-ferentz-pat-fitzgerald-clayton-thorson-undefeated-big-ten", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658340-college-football-week-7-photos-pictures-ncaa-auburn-kentucky-charles-walker-ricardo-louis/slide/366608", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Best", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Is", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2015-10-17/alabama-scores-two-pick-sixes-minkah-fitzpatrick-eddie-jackson", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfznm5.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_ncaa&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfu55n.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Would", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Henry", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfvfBL.img&quot;}}"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:11:32.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
