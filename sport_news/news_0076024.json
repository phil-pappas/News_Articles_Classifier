Features local beer on tap and pub food, with the occasional band. Located on West Spruce Street, The Old Post has been feeding Missoula for over twenty years.

In 2006, Flathead Brewing Co. received two World Beer Cup awards, one of the youngest breweries to ever receive it. Will McKnight / Montana Kaimin @WillMcK_Photo \nThe Missoula Club, located on West Main street has been serving its patrons for over thirty years with burgers and beer. \nIf there are two things people in Missoula love, it’s drinking and football. \nAnd if they can combine the two? Even better. Tailgates are arguably a bigger attraction at Griz games than the games themselves, with fans itching to leave the stadium as soon as halftime arrives. If the game is a blowout? Those fans drink for joy in the streets and parking lots outside the stadium rather than watch the game inside it. \nDowntown, college and NFL games fill bar televisions as fans of all different teams hit the town to cheer on their boys. \nKaimin Sports hit 11 different bars (for research purposes only, of course) this weekend to watch the early Sunday NFL games, as well as the big Monday night showdown between the Packers and Chiefs. \nHere are a few standout places we noticed. \nBest place for die-hards: Red’s \nRed’s is an old-school kind of place that brings in old-school kind of people. \nTerry Lawrence, sitting at the worn wood bar under the row of old team pennants strung from the ceiling, says that he’s been coming to Red’s since about 1990. \n“It’s the best sports bar in town,” Lawrence said. “They remember everybody — your name, what you do, what you’re drinking — every time you come in.” \nRed’s is one of the smaller bars we hit, but it draws one of the most diverse (in terms of fandom) crowds in town. \nLawrence, a Packers fan, was sitting close to James Ledyard, who reps the Lions, and Ledyard’s friend Shawn McKinney, a Giants fan. \nAt back tables, there were groups of Eagles and Browns fans cheering their teams on. \nThe decor may not be as expansive at Red’s compared to some other establishments, but if you’re just looking for a place to watch your team on a Sunday morning with a bunch of other serious fans, this may be the spot for you. \nBest place to brunch and watch: Tamarack \nThe early 11 a.m. start for NFL games in Montana can be a little bit of a shock for East Coasters in Missoula, but it does offer a unique opportunity – Sunday brunch can start at kickoff and go straight through the first slate of games. \nNo bar we visited took better advantage of this than the Tamarack, which features a build-your-own mimosa and bloody mary bar on their lower level for the early Sunday games. \nThis is such an ingenious idea that we’re wondering why it hasn’t been federally mandated yet. If you want to add a little class to your gameday experience, hit up the Tam. \nBest newcomer: Meagher Bar \nThe Meagher Bar has been open for less than a year, but it ranks highly as one of the best places we went to, period. \nThe projection screen at the back end of the bar means they can show the game of the week in wide-angle, with the other big screens accommodating patrons who want to watch other games. \n“We opened on Dec. 8 last year, so we kind of missed football season a little bit, but we’re definitely going for the football crowd,” said Carissa Okragly, who’s been working behind the bar at Meagher since they opened. \nBest place if you’re from Wisconsin: The Top Hat \nThe Top Hat isn’t what comes to most people’s minds when they think of football bars, but owner Nick Checota, a die-hard Wisconsinite from Milwaukee, has been showing Packers games on the big projection screen for years now. \n“You don’t come in if you’re not wearing a Packers jersey,” yelled Zach Kraft, lounging on a couch right in front of the screen. \n“You can, but you’re stepping into the wrong territory,” added his friend Aaron Arnold. \nEven with this limitation, the Top Hat draws a packed crowd for every Green Bay game, one that boos every bad turn and celebrates every Packer score with a free shot of Packer Juice, a lurid green cocktail of Melonball and vodka. \nWith Aaron Rodgers being his usual superlative self leading the Pack to a 3-0 record so far, that’s a lot of free shots downed. \nBut somehow, I don’t think Checota minds. \nHonorable mentions: The Press Box is the quintessential Missoula sports bar, with three levels decorated with Griz memorabilia just across the river from campus. The Iron Horse was our first stop on Sunday, so it hadn’t filled up yet, but the sunlight coming through their big plate glass windows made it a nice place to finish waking up in. Boomer’s and the Desperado are classic wings-and-beer spots — worth a look if you don’t want to head downtown for a change. \nandrew.houghton@umontana.edu", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:55:56.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
