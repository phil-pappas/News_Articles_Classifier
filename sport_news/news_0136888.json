He is tied for the team lead with 4.0 sacks this season. Young led a ferocious defensive attack that recorded a season-high eight sacks and limited the Eagles to -10 yards rushing and 79 yards of total offense. It marked the most sacks on an opponent since the Cardinals tallied eight sacks against Wake Forest on Sept. 27, 2014. Louisville will look to extend its win streak Friday night as the Cardinals play at Wake Forest on Oct. 30. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. on ESPN2.
