QB1's Jim Baxter and Former South Carolina quarterback Stephen Garcia are joining forces to produce week-long (seven day) quarterback training academy sessions in the off-season. These sessions are for all quarterbacks from 2nd grade through collegiate and will be in three separate divisions - 2nd through 5th grade, Middle School, and High School/Collegiate. There will be one training week per month in the off-season with this particular training opportunity. Training sessions are in small group only and are limited space so early registration is highly encouraged to reserve your spot. The QB1 ELITE TRAINING WEEK includes SEVEN days of training with QB1 Quarterback Coach Jim Baxter and former USC Quarterback Stephen Garcia. These sessions begin on Monday afternoon and are 75 minutes long and run through Friday. The remaining two sessions are in camp format on Saturday and Sunday and include competition format. Funtional Performance Training focuses on drills designed specifically for the mechanical requirements for their position. During this phase, athletes will also learn about nutrition and training. We instruct on how to set these drills up and how to perform them so the players can take a program design with them to work on in their own time. Position instruction and drills which will cover the mechanical issues, footwork, and mental aspect of their position. Players will be instructed on coverage reads and progressions. You cannot control how tall you are, how good your competion will be, or how hard your competitors will work. What you can control are the development of your own speed, you footwork, your mechanics, your understanding of the mental side of the game, and how hard you will work. We will only concentrate on the things that you do have control over.
