FIBA Americas teams Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico; Angola, Tunisia and Senegal in the AfroBasket side; Asian countries Philippines, Iran and Japan and New Zealand representing the FIBA Oceania side. \nThere those who are saying that FIBA Asia was our best chance while the final Olympic qualifier would be hard to conquer since most of the top basketball nations will be campaigning in that event. \nWhat these doubters must realize is Philippine basketball in the international scene has grown by leaps and bounds. \nThe last FIBA World Cup in Spain where the Philippine team, collectively known as Gilas Pilipinas, happened just about a year ago and it was a fact that the Nationals overachieved in that event that led to countless compliments from basketball pundits around the globe. \nBefore beating Senegal in their last schedule, Gilas lost to three of four teams by an average of 3.6 points and these were against known basketball hotbeds Croatia, Puerto Rico and Argentina. \nThe Philippines’ other loss was against Greece, 82-70. \nFrom today until July 2016, that’s about nine months to prepare for that one big push to Rio though politics in basketball will surely be an issue. \nBut thinking positive about it, it is more than enough time to tweak the line-up that competed in China. \nThe biggest boost may come from the availability of Los Angeles Lakers sophomore guard Jordan Clarkson, who is technically eligible to play for the country after it was learned that he has been a holder of a Philippine passport before turning 16. \nAs per FIBA rules, a foreign-born player is required to obtain a passport that came from the country he intends to play for before turning 16. \nAs for his Lakers’ obligation, there won’t be any conflict for Clarkson because even if LA makes the Finals, the championship series would be over by June. \nMeantime, naturalized center Andray Blatche may be in better shape around that time as his Chinese Basketball Association commitment may be over by then. \nUsually, the CBA stages its season from November until March, giving Blatche enough time to rest for a while before plunging back to training for the Philippines Olympic bid. \nReports have it the Philippines has also signified its intention to bid for one of those three qualifiers together with Mexico, Canada, Italy, Turkey and Russia. \nWith all these possibilities, all our players and officials need to do is to lick its wounds only for a while, get into stride and continue our Olympic dream which definitely did not end up as a nightmare in China.
