We definitely didn't expect it.\" \nDavis and McGee voiced their support of Grier during a trying time. Their starting quarterback, who said he made a mistake by not getting UF medical staff to approve a supplement he took, will be missed. \n\"We're all going to make our own decisions at the end of the day,\" Davis said. \"If he made the mistake of not running it by them, it was a mistake. As a team we have to stick together, so we can't undress him for making a mistake like that.\" \nCold as it may seem, though, it already was time to move on for Davis, McGee and the resurgent Gators (6-0, 4-0 SEC). \nA visit to No. 6 LSU has their undivided attention. It still might not be enough to stop the Tigers (5-0, 3-0) and Heisman front-runner Leonard Fournette on Saturday night in Tiger Stadium. \n\"There's really no time to focus on distractions,\" McGee said. \"A family member, we love him, but a big game coming up and we're all in toward LSU.\" \nGrier has played a key role positioning the Gators for their biggest game since 2012, when just four current players were on the active roster — defensive end Jon Bullard, guard Trip Thurman, defensive back Brian Poole and linebacker Antonio Morrison. \nGrier, who was not at Tuesday's practice, was 5-0 as a starter this season and on track for the best season at the position since Tim Tebow in 2009. \n\"Will was doing some crazy things on Saturdays, some things I've never seen in my life,\" Davis said. \"He was shaking dudes, making all these crazy passes.\" \nBut Davis and his teammates are confident moving forward with sophomore Treon Harris, who has seven career starts and rotated with Grier during the season's first two games. Harris and Grier were neck-and-neck for the starting job until coach Jim McElwain finally went all in on Grier during the SEC opener Sept. 19 at Kentucky. \n\"Will and Treon were both in a competition, it was tight one, too,\" Davis said. \"Sitting out there practicing in fall camp seeing them both compete, it was good, it was awesome. We knew we had something if it went either way.\" \nHarris is now the Gators' sole option at quarterback, but a very good alternative to Grier if you ask McGee. \n\"He's really ready,\" McGee said. \"He's a heck of a quarterback who has been in a lot of big games. He's a heck of a player. \n\"I don't think there will be much of a drop off.\" \nThurman agreed, while lauding Harris' unwavering focus as Grier's backup the past four games. \n\"He's stayed with it and I applaud him for that,\" Thurman, a fifth-year senior, said. \"Because some guys, would just want to take the back seat, but he's been in the meeting rooms, he's been with Coach Nuss [offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier,] meeting with him, working. And even with Grier being the starter he's done well. \n\"I'm proud of him.\" \nHarris proved himself worthy in a big-game environment as a freshman coming off the bench to rally Florida to a win at Tennessee. \nBut Grier staged his own come-back against Tennessee last month to win over his teammates, including those, like Davis, who believed Harris would win the job entering the season. \n\"I was kind of surprised that he wasn't starting this year,\" Davis said. \"At the same time, coach makes those decisions. He picked the right guy, and now it's time for Treon to step up, take that spot back, charge on, and take us to the next checkpoint.\" \nFlorida's season remains full of possibility, even with Grier out and Harris in. The Gators have a commanding lead in the SEC East and would enter the college football playoff conversation with a win in Baton Rouge. \n\"We've been waiting for this all season,\" Davis said. \"We didn't know we'd be in this position, in the top 10, but we're just ready to go. We want to take over.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:29:08.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
