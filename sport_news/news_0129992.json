It would put the RedBlacks two wins ahead of the Argos in the standings. And it would give Ottawa one more win than Hamilton, the team it's tied with at the top of the East standings. The Tiger-Cats play Saskatchewan Friday night.\nThen there's the fact that Tuesday's game will be the the RedBlacks' third game in 11 days. Again, none of this is of concern to the RedBlacks or their coaches. No excuses, just take care of the business at hand.\n\"We tend to do better when we just focus on us and don't worry about the standings or how many days rest we've had or any of that stuff,\" said RedBlacks coach Rick Campbell. \"Guys are excited to get back out there again. It's happening fast, but we're just looking at it as the next game on the schedule.\"\n\"We all have our eyes on the big prize, but our mentality is to take it game by game, one step at a time,\" said linebacker Antoine Pruneau. \"Of course we know there is a playoff possibility and we want to get into the playoffs.\"\n\"We're hunkered down and we have tunnel vision for this game,\" said offensive lineman Nolan MacMillan. \"I'm looking forward to a couple of days off, but we're going to go out, we're going to empty the tank, we're going to play as hard as we can and hopefully it's enough to put us over the top.\"\n\"Don't look too far ahead, don't look at the standings,\" said defensive end Shawn Lemon. \"None of that matters now, it matters at the end of the season. Try to get a bit better than you were last week.\"\n\"Everybody's on the same page,\" said defensive back Abdul Kanneh. \"We understand the common goal which is to win games one week at a time. Eventually that leads to something bigger -- which is playoffs and then the Grey Cup.\"\nThe RedBlacks feel like they let one get away in Toronto -- a 30-24 loss they led into the fourth quarter. A bit more than a week ago, the Argos won 35-26 at TD Place in a game where the RedBlacks lacked intensity.\n\"It's very fresh in our minds,\" said Lemon. \"We played them a week and some change ago. They came into our house and beat us. They were a bit more physical than we were. It's a challenge for us to come out, be more physical and get a win.\"\nThe RedBlacks hammered the Montreal Alouettes 39-17 last Thursday. They'll need to take some of the positives from that game and put them into play against the Argos.\n\"(Against the Als), we tried to come here and do what we didn't go against Toronto -- make sure Montreal didn't leave with a win,\" said Kanneh. \"Now that we're done with that, it's back to square one with Toronto, try to make sure we get the W. We really want to play today. We don't want to wait.\"\n\"We have the ball rolling right now, we just have to keep it up,\" said receiver Greg Ellingson, who caught five passes for 83 yards agaisnt the Als. \"You never really know how things are going to play out so it's nice to stack up the wins while you can. We have a good opportunity with Toronto as the focus now and then we'll see what happens down the stretch.\"\nAs for yet another game, five days after their last one, Lemon said: \"We actually kind of like it. A lot of athletes don't like practising too much. Shorter practices and playing games ... game days are always fun.\"\nTwitter: @TimCBaines\nOttawa RedBlacks focused on task at hand\nBy Tim Baines , Ottawa Sun First posted: Monday, October 05, 2015 03:45 PM EDT | Updated: Monday, October 05, 2015 09:08 PM EDT\nWith a CFL playoff picture that's still plenty muddy, the Ottawa RedBlacks insist they're not getting caught up in the what-ifs.\nThe focus for Tuesday night's game is solely on the Toronto Argos, a team that has already beaten the RedBlacks twice this year.
