When the fifth pick came up in the 2015 draft, Leonard Williams thought he was about to be selected by Washington.\n“Yeah, I did,” Williams said from the Jets locker room Wednesday.\nInstead, Washington took offensive lineman Brandon Scherff, and Williams dropped into the lap of the Jets with the sixth pick.\n“I wasn’t sure (if he would fall),” Jet coach Todd Bowles said. “You think you have a shot at him. It was like, wow, this guy fell to six so without hesitation we took him and we’re very happy with him.”\nAt first Williams admitted he was a little bummed to have fallen in the draft.\n“I was a little disappointed just because I believed that I was a top-three pick,” the defensive end said.\nThe Jets didn’t need a defensive lineman, but they eschewed need and went with Williams anyway.\nOn Sunday, Williams will likely get a chance to face off against Scherff, the man Washington selected instead of him.\n“I can’t really say that it’s payback or revenge because they didn’t really do anything to me because they just chose what they needed,” Williams said.\nIN REVERSE\nOn Monday, Darrelle Revis said he hoped DeSean Jackson (hamstring) would play. It’s sounding more likely he’ll get his wish, as Washington coach Jay Gruden said Wednesday that he is optimistic that the explosive receiver would be back on the field.\nHowever, Revis changed his tune about whether he wants Jackson to be out there.\n“I don’t care if he plays or not,” Revis said.\nFOR STARTERS\nBowles wouldn’t reveal his plan for Sheldon Richardson on Sunday, but said that the defensive lineman could start depending on what package Washington opens up in... Right guard Willie Colon (knee) was limited in practice, and Bowles said he still isn’t sure if the offensive lineman will be available. Colon missed the team’s last game with the injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:25:20.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
