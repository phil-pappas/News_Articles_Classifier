Dissed NBA player John Henson got an apology Tuesday from the owner of a Wisconsin jewelry store whose workers locked the door and fled to the back when the Milwaukee Bucks power forward tried to come inside.\n“He was sincere in his apology,” Henson said of Schwanke-Kasten Jewelers president Tom Dixon. “He knew that shouldn't have happened. He's had some prior incidents, but it still doesn't make it right for them to do what they did.”\nHenson also told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that profiling of all blacks as criminals by businesses is “a real issue.”\n“I am going to do some things to raise awareness of situations like that and go from there,” he told the paper.\nHenson, 24, took to Instagram on Monday to describe the “degrading” incident that happened to him when he stopped by the upscale jeweler in Whitefish Bay to shop.\n“They locked the door and told me to go away,” he wrote. “After I rang the doorbell twice everyone went to the back. No (one) answered the door or told me what was going on.”\nJohn Henson/via Instagram Henson said he was racially profiled and discriminated against when he tried to shop at the Schwanke-Kasten jewelry store. Minutes later, Henson wrote, the cops arrived and grilled him about what he was doing at the store — and about the dealer vehicle he was driving.\n“I told them I was just trying to look at a watch,” Henson wrote. The cop “then had to go in the back and tell them to come out it was safe but this is after they ran my plates.”\nThe 6-foot-11-inch ball player wrote that the workers eventually came out of hiding and “proceeded to conduct business like they previously were as we walked up.”\n“This store needs to be called out and that's what I'm doing,” he told his 51,000 followers. “You have no right to profile someone because of their race and nationality.”\nThe family-­owned store has been in business since 1899.\ncsiemaszko@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Bucks' Henson says he was racially profiled at jewelry store", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:50:02.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
