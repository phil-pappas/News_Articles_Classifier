He just kind of looked at me and said, 'I don't care. Whichever one you like, Tabes.' That made me feel good. We can kind of check that one off the list, but you're only as good as your next kick, and he understands that, so he needs to have another good week this week.\" \nAlthough Coons had never kicked in a regular-season game before the opener at the New York Jets last month, the Browns were confident in his approach on the field, despite his penchant for missing several attempts in practice. \n\"He gets his misses out,\" Tabor said with a wry smile. \"With Thursday's practice on field goals, (it's) usually the miss day. It has been tough to say a little bit because a couple weeks ago, he might've missed four of them, and then, afterwards, he said, 'I'm going to go hit some more.' I said, 'No. You know, my mom told me some days, there will be days like that. You've just got to let it go.' \n\"With a young kicker, if they do have a bad day at practice, the natural tendency is, 'I'm going to go hit some more, hit some more,' and then, what happens is their leg gets tired. He's improved and he's working at his craft, and we're still learning Coonsey ourselves from the standpoint of he has multiple kicks, and we're working on some things on the side. If we need to use them, we'll be able to do that. \n\"I just thought in training camp, the one thing that really struck you is when he hits his ball, he has good rotation on his ball, but it's a straight ball. There's not a lot of draw or fade to it, and I just felt like going into the season, the weather, the wind and those type of things, that's what you're looking for, a guy that can hit his line and then, if he misses, it's not because of a duck hook or anything like that. It's just probably because his line was just a little off, but he's done a nice job for us. He's going to continue to get better, and we're excited about which way he's trending right now.\" \nAlthough Coons is trending in an upward direction according to Browns coaches, Tabor knows his kicker is still developing a routine, both during the week and the day of the game, and one of those things he is working to improve on is his kickoffs, and that is one thing the veteran special-teams coach wants to see heading into Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos at FirstEnergy Stadium. \n\"There's been some mis-contact with it, and that's something that he is working on,\" Tabor said. \"It's an area that he needs to improve and he will improve, but he's also beginning to move the ball a little bit, which is going to help us, especially with the weather. I think it's supposed to be pretty windy on Sunday, so I think the things that he's been working on hopefully come into play.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RNkBBm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:15:57.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
