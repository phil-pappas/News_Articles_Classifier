Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports)\n10 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE A New York Mets fan was left in critical condition in a Dodger Stadium parking lot after a fight with a Los Angeles Dodgers fan after Game 1 of the National League Division Series.\nWitnesses say the incident began as a verbal argument and escalated into a physical confrontation. The Mets fan was punched and fell and hit his head on the concrete, causing the severity of the injury.\nThe attack draws an disturbing comparison to San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow, who suffered serious brain damage after he was beaten in a similar incident on Opening Day at Dodger Stadium in 2011.\nPolice authorities are searching for those involved. The victim is in stable but critical condition at the hospital.\nThe Dodgers dd not comment on the incident.\nA friend of the victim tweeted: @Dodgers Embarrassed to be a Dodger fan as my Mets fan friend is in the hospital missing a piece of his skull after being hit by a lowlife.\nTOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1617756645cd53588f08f733dd136e8327d7b7ac/c=245-0-4012-2832&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803477247381488-USATSI-8849084.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RFDYw5&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RFDYw5&text=Mets%20fan%20critically%20injured%20after%20fight%20at%20Dodger%20Stadium&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/521cd80a4fb9f1f1edf37d025629b379daee5bba/r=500x332/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803477247381488-USATSI-8849084.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803477247381488-USATSI-8849084.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:05:01.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
