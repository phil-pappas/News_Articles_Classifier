To stem the flow of the blood rushing from the gash, a team doctor used a staple gun to patch Rooney’s skin together.\nThe 30-year-old captain then jogged back on the field as if staples were not holding his scalp together.\nThe gutsy move didn’t turn out to be a winning one, though, as the rivalry finished a 0-0 draw.\nFootage we really didn't need to see, Rooney getting his head stapled. #ManchesterDerby pic.twitter.com/xCt0W2I9bu \n— Neil Sherwin (@neilsherwin) October 25, 2015 \n\n  manchester city ,  manchester united ,  soccer ,  wayne rooney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:03:39.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
