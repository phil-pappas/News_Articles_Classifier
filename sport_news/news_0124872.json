Ed Wisneski Special to the Courier Nicknamed the \"Beast of Provence,\" Mont Ventoux in southeastern France stands as a 6,273-foot tall magnet attracting cyclists from around the world who brave its tricky winds and unyielding, gut-busting gradient to reach the barren, limestone summit devoid of trees and vegetation. That's why it's also called \"Bald Mountain.\" Considered one of the 10 most difficult cycling climbs in the world, the \"Beast\" has gained notoriety as one of the stages in the Tour de France. It's been part of the race 15 times since 1951, nine of them as the finish of a stage. In 2009, cyclists had peddled approximately 90 miles before beginning the final ascent, a feat of superhuman endurance.Six members of Bike Prescott, a local cycling group, made the pilgrimage to Mont Ventoux in mid-September: Eileen and Kelly Macauley, Pat and Jim McCarver, Randy Baker, and Tana Brown. Their tour company, Trek Travel, provided them with high-quality carbon bikes with electronic shifters and upgraded gears and brakes.\"You experience things on a bike that you don't on a bus tour,\" Pat says, \"like smelling the lavender. It's a challenging, iconic climb...a bucket list destination for some cyclists.\"The group erupted in laughter when advised that a Mont Ventoux website lists \"hike\" as the easiest way to get to the top. All six took the most famous and difficult of the three cycling routes to the peak, starting in Bédoin. They all made it to the summit after climbing 5,305 feet over a distance of 13.5 miles. The final 10 miles average an 8.9 percent incline with a maximum of 10.5 percent. The wind blows at least 56 miles per hour 240 days a year.\"We got a break with the wind,\" says Kelly, 52, the first of the group to reach the pinnacle in just over two hours, averaging about six miles per hour. (The record of 55 minutes, 51 seconds was set in 2004 by Spaniard Iban Mayo, who averaged 14.4 mph.) \"The day after our climb I saw a guy from Sweden. His bike was a mess. The seat was twisted. He was all scuffed up. When I asked him what happened, he said, 'The wind just blew me over.' We were lucky we didn't go a day later.\" In Prescott, there are shorter, steeper gradients than those at Mont Ventoux, places like the roads in Granite Basin and the ascent to Bucky's Casino from Route 89. The group trained on several of them. Nothing, however, could prepare them for what the French locals proudly call Le Mont Ventoux (THE Mont Ventoux), signifying there's no other mountain like it.\"What makes Mont Ventoux so difficult is that it's a long, continuous uphill climb,\" says Kelly. \"There are no flat stretches. The word that comes to my mind is 'ridiculous.' When I was riding next to Tana, I looked over and said, 'Can you believe we're doing this?' I must have told myself at least 10 times on the way up that I didn't think I could do it.\"The climb presents a psychological test as well as a physical one. Signs at every kilometer along the road post the distance remaining to the summit and the gradient, which increases steadily during the middle of the climb.\"The signs look like gravestones,\" Eileen recalls with a laugh. \"I saw a guy sitting on top of one.\"Another confidence deflator near the top, the Tom Simpson Memorial, reminds cyclists that in 1967 someone actually died from heat exhaustion and other causes on that spot, one-half mile from the peak.\"Your legs are asking for oxygen, and your brain wants it, too,\" Kelly says. \"Your brain starts doing funny things on this ride. Your motivation to complete your goal makes you blank out the suffering to finish the climb.\"From an overhead camera, the last kilometer with a 10% gradient coils like a hose thrown on the ground.\"It was very windy,\" Kelly recalls. \"It was so cold [in the 30's Fahrenheit] I could see my breath. That last kilometer is where you see a lot of cyclists walking.\"Kelly was the only one of the group who didn't stop during the ascent. Jim McCarver, 67, the oldest among them, was next to finish despite having to halt once to allow a herd of sheep to cross the road. Kelly turned around after reaching the top to accompany Eileen to the summit. Tana and Randy were near the finish, but Pat and Eileen had a good distance remaining after making a few judicious stops.\"You couldn't just stop anywhere,\" Pat says, \"because in some places it's so steep you couldn't get going again. Sometimes, it was hard even to use your water bottle.\"Kelly, Jim, and Tana enjoyed the thrill of their reward for reaching the summit - zooming back down the mountain at speeds between 40 and 50 miles per hour. Eileen calls it the\"Wheeee.\" \"I cried like a baby when I reached the top,\" says Eileen, who descended in a van with Pat because of they arrived much later than the others. Randy took it part of the way down.The following day the group biked 48 miles with a 4,150 feet climb to their next stop near a massive limestone gorge on the Nesque River. The six cyclists all have different training routines in Prescott. Because of their jobs, Eileen and Pat say they're lucky to ride 70 miles a week. Eileen did complete the 52.9-mile route of the Skull Valley Loop Challenge three times during the month before they left. \"It's pretty amazing they made it to the top,\" says Kelly.Tana rides an average of 125 miles per week. Earlier this year, she and Kelly combined as a team to tackle the 100-mile Chino Grinder, a race over gravel and paved roads. Kelly rode first 50 miles to Williams, and Tana covered the same distance back. Amazingly, they both finished the Skull Valley Loop Challenge the day after they flew more than 10 hours back from France to Phoenix!Last year the McCarvers cycled up another part of the French Alps used in the Tour de France, 10,930-foot L'Alpe d'Huez. The climb, 3,670 feet over approximately nine miles, has 21 hairpin turns and an overall average gradient of 8.1%, slightly more than the route to Mont Ventoux.\"Mentally, it was a very different climb [from Mont Ventoux],\" Pat says. \"You could stop along the way. We talked with cyclists from Sweden, Holland, Great Britain, and other places.\" Tana is already planning their next adventure for 2016, a seven-day, 470-mile ride along the California coastline from San Francisco to Santa Monica.Compared to Mont Ventoux, it should be a piece of cake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:47:26.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
