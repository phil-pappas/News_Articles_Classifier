After North Texas was dropped from the series, Jack Caress of Pacific Sports revived the local race.\n\"It's already bigger than last year,\" said Caress, one of the original pro series founders, who has worked with the cities of Rockwall and Heath to hold the event. \"This was never a short-term project. We came back with the goal to slowly but surely grow it and make sure it's legitimate forever.\"\nCaress, a longtime race producer in California, has used Active's services since 1999. He knows Active is not perfect and that there are other online registration options, but he's remained loyal.\n\"What Active did for the industry was extremely profound,\" he said. \"They legitimized online registration. They changed the industry forever.\"\nActive has continued to expand and offer new products. Caress said he's an early adopter of the Active Network Activity Cloud, which offers data insights and an understanding of the competitive race market to better identify potential participants and marketing strategies.\n\"How do we separate ourselves from the clutter?\" he said noting that many markets including Dallas have many events every weekend. \"Some of the information is helping us position ourselves in terms of pricing, when we do advertising, where we do advertising, how we reach out to people. They've done an incredible amount of research.\"\nFor the U.S. Open, Active's relationship goes beyond its role as a service provider. Active will have approximately 200 race participants, which is about 25% of the company's Dallas office. Others will be race day volunteers.\nACTIVEx, the company's employee and communit y health and wellness effort, has two specific goals: to fund raise for an organization whose mission aligns with the company's goal of \"making the world more active,\" and to encourage employee participation, said Arch Fuston, director and creator of ACTIVEx.\nThe company encourages its employees to sign up for one of the U.S. Open's races, which include Olympic, Sprint, Super Sprint-distance triathlons and a 5K. They also must agree to $300 toward the company's national charity: Kids in the Game. Nationally, ACTIVEx has raised nearly $500,000 and enabled nearly 4,000 youth from low-income families to participate in sports activities since 2013.\nIn return, the company buys participating employees their race entry, outfits them in appropriate race-day apparel and provides a training plan and group training opportunities including a three-day off-site training weekend.\n\"Everyone knows it's not about swimming, biking and running,\" Fuston said. \"It's about building relationships and helping each other succeed.\"\nActive challenges its employees physically and mentally to achieve an empowering fitness goal and to raise a significant amount for a good cause. An added benefit is its employees become more familiar with the markets the company serves and the products used to serve them, Fuston said.\n\"It's an eco-system of health and wellness,\" Fuston said.\nBriefly: Aledo's Megan Flowers Skeels won Sunday's Mohawk Hudson Marathon in New York in 2:46:39 to earn an automatic elite entry into the Boston Marathon ...
