Comment By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 9:00 PM By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 9:00 PM Erica Chalmers grew up in the shadow of Wellesley College. From her Natick home “it’s about a 20-minute walk,” she said. The natural beauty of the campus was inescapable. Walking the 2.4 miles around Lake Waban was a joy. “I spent a lot of time recreationally at the college, but I never imagined going here.” Still, her parents thought, Why not? Their daughter saw it differently. “It was so close to where I lived, so I always wrote it off as a joke.” It was no laughing matter. After a freshman year at Natick High and three at the Rivers School in Weston, Chalmers had the marks and the desire to get into one of world’s top women’s colleges. “I constantly feel enormously privileged to go to Wellesley,” said the 19-year-old sophomore. “It’s opened my eyes to a lot of things that go on in the world.” Chalmers is majoring in international relations. It’s a passion that has long burned within, especially regarding the education and needs of women around the globe. When she was at Rivers, Chalmers helped start a non-profit organization to help educate girls in West Africa. “I’m trying to incorporate that at Wellesley too.” She’s also trying to help the Blue soccer team get to the NEWMAC tournament. Last Saturday, Chalmers scored late in the second overtime to beat WPI 1-0. Time of game: 107:44. “Sometimes it takes more than 90 minutes,” said Chalmers. “That was a big game for us,” said Blue coach Tony Mohammed. It boosted his team’s record to 6-5-2. Mohammed couldn’t figure out why Chalmers didn’t immediately celebrate the clutch goal. “The referee didn’t blow the whistle right away,” explained Chalmers. “I thought it was bad luck, that the goal didn’t count. Then my teammates tackled me to the ground. I was in a state of shock, of disbelief. Was this really happening? I was in the right place at the right time.” “We needed to get at least a point in that game,” said Mohammed. There are no ordinary, carefree games for Chalmers. She plays with the scary reality that any game could be her last. She has suffered three concussions that forced her to miss numerous games. “The first concussion was when I was playing for Rivers,” she said. “I had a minor one soon after. I was very aware of concussions after that.” The third one occurred last month, against Emerson College. Page 2 of 2 - “I had the false impression that it wasn’t going to happen again,” said Chalmers. “I was receiving a pass on a throw-in. The ball hit the back of my head. I knew it was a concussion. I got a little disoriented.” She missed the next three games. “I did get to go home and spent time in the dark,” she said. Naturally, both of her parents are concerned. Her mother has done a lot of research on head injuries. \"For now, I’m going forward and playing with the team,” said Chalmers. “The athletic trainer knows what’s going to. Last year, we had a player who had to stop playing (because of a concussion).” Chalmers didn’t get much playing time last season. “But she worked hard this year and made an impression,” said Mohammed. “In many ways Erica is the heart of our team. She embodies what we want to preach to our players.” Like women’s education and soccer, preaching also connects with Chalmers’ lifestyle. She’s a member of Boston Church of Christ, which has a meeting place in downtown Framingham. When asked what she hopes to be doing in her mid-20s, she references his international relations major. “I’d love to be in some capacity where I could support girls education” around the world. “I’m a big dreamer.” Lenny Megliola can be reached at lennymegs@aol.com.
