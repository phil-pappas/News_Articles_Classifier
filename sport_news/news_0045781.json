I'm thankful for my teammates giving me that second chance.\"\nThe Huskers had taken the lead with 3:38 to play, but for the second straight week they failed to put away their opponent and now have lost four games by a total of 11 points. All four losses have come on the opponent's final offensive play.\n\"I'd have to look back a ways, but I don't think I've really seen this before,\" first-year Nebraska coach Mike Riley said. \"But we are in it. When you have games like we've had, you'll look at many different circumstances on how, playing or coaching, you could make a difference.\"\nFullback Andy Janovich broke a 55-yard touchdown run to put Nebraska (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) up 21-20.\nAfter the Badgers drove to the Nebraska 21, Galianone's field-goal try bounced off the right upright, no good. But he made good on his next chance.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:27:10.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
