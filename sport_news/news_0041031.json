The UNLV campus continues to celebrate after Saturday’s big defeat over UNR. The win means the Rebels have regained possession of the Fremont Cannon and, as of Monday morning, it is officially sporting a new red coat of paint. The Fremont Cannon tradition dates back more than 45 years. In its history, the cannon has been blue more than it’s been red. Now, many people who witnessed the big win over the weekend believe a new era for UNLV has dawned. It’s the most coveted college football prize in the entire state; the Fremont Cannon is a replica of the 19th century, Howitzer Cannon. Whether it actually works or not is irrelevant, what matters most to both UNR and UNLV is what it represents and which team gets to keep it for the entire year.UNLV managed a defeat on Saturday, October 3, beating UNR’s Wolfpack 23-17 in Reno. The victory is especially significant for first-year coach Tony Sanchez, who believes the program is headed in the right direction.\"Again, going into the season expectation for us weren't very high and what I challenged our kids was, let's just be that guy no one wants to fight. If we learn to be that guy no one wants to scrap with we're going to have a shot to win football games,\" said Sanchez.Athletic Director, Tina Kunzer-Murphy, shares that sentiment. She says now is the time to re-establish discussions about a brand new football facility on campus. \"I think people are believing in Rebel football and it's something. The climates changing, so it's the perfect time to do that,\" said Kunzer-Murphy. For the students, the cannon means bragging rights for the year. For the players, it’s only a first step. UNLV team members know there’s still a lot of the season left and a lot of stiff competition in the coming weeks. \"There is a toughness and a blue-collar grit to what we're doing here and we're going to keep that going,\" said Coach Sanchez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:29:44.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
