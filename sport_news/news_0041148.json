Fearnall was previously the director of marketing solutions at LinkedIn, and played a role helping the professional networking site expand into Canada.\nSteven Uster of FundThrough, an alternative lender that provides loans secured against a company’s unpaid invoices, says he often works with small business owners who report being turned down by the banks.\n“Likely, if the loan is less than $250,000, you’re going to get rejected, because banks just no longer like to lend less than $250,000,” Uster said. “It’s just not profitable for them.”\nOnline lender Mogo currently only provides personal loans, but founder David Feller says the company is working on a product for business owners.\nMost financial institutions require at least two years of business financial statements before they will offer a corporate loan — a “high bar” for entrepreneurs looking to expand rapidly, says Feller.\n“Because of the challenges they have going through the traditional models like the banks, a lot of small business loans are based off of personal credit,” said Feller, noting that many of Mogo’s borrowers are using the cash to fund their business ventures.\n“A lot of small business owners and entrepreneurs are just applying for a personal loan, as it’s easier to get that than a small business loan through a bank.”\nAt least one of Canada’s biggest banks, however, says it sees an opportunity in the marketplace lending space. At its investor day last week, CIBC (TSX:CM) said it has partnered with a fintech company to explore launching an algorithm-based online lending service that will offer loans at an average value of $50,000.\n—\nFollow @alexposadzki on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:50:59.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
