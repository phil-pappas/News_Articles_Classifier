And the four-headed monster of first- and second-year power pitchers in the Mets rotation might be the deepest, nastiest starting crew in this year’s 10-team playoff field.\n“Probably it is,” Cubs catcher Miguel Montero said. “Now we’ve got [rookie Noah] Syndergaard. I know he’s the ‘soft-‘throwing right-hander, right? He only throws 99.”\n“It is that good,” said of the Mets’ starting pitching. “We knew that coming in. We have Jake [Arrieta] pitching tomorrow. They know how good he is.\n“Listen, honestly, our guys were fine tonight.”\nAnd they have done this before, losing the Division Series opener to the Cardinals before winning the next three to advance.\nAnd they eventually got to Harvey – with Schwarber knocking him out of the game when he hit Harvey’s 97th pitch halfway to LaGuardia Airport.\nTheir $155 million playoff veteran, Jon Lester, had trouble keeping pace with Harvey – allowing a pair of homers and four runs in 6 2/3 innings.\n“Once again, I put our team behind the eight ball against a really good pitcher,” said Lester, who lost the St. Louis opener, and on this night kicked himself especially hard for giving up the go-ahead run in the fifth after Starlin Castro’s double on a misplayed line drive drove home Rizzo to tie it in the top of the inning.\n“That’s the game. I’ve got to do a better job of getting our guys back in the dugout,” Lester said.\n“Hopefully Jake can pick me up tomorrow.”\nAfter hitting 12 homers in their first five playoff games against Pittsburgh and St. Louis, the Cubs managed one by Schwarber, on a night the temperature started in the upper 40s and dropped throughout the game – cold enough that right-fielder Jorge Soler, Baez and Castro all wore blue ski masks in the field.\nSchwarber’s home run gave him four for the postseason – tying the Mets’ Daniel Murphy (who hit one in the first) for most this postseason. He also has hit homers in three consecutive games, tying Alex Gonzalez (2003) for the franchise record.\nAnd now they come back and try to steal home-field advantage against Syndergaard.\n“You can’t live and die on one game,” first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. “We did live and die on one game a few weeks ago [against Pittsburgh in the wild-card game]. So now we get to breathe a little bit.\n“We did lose our first game in St. Louis and bounced back. So I expect nothing less out of this team.”\nHarvey retired the first 12 Cubs he faced, half on strikeouts, before hitting Rizzo with a pitch leading off the sixth.\nCastro followed with his drive over the head of center fielder Juan Lagares – who started in before retreating, too late.\nThe hit tied the game, but when Castro failed to get out of the box quickly, he wound up on second instead of having a shot at a triple (he said after the game he didn’t believe he would have had three bases either regardless).\nIt proved potentially costly when Baez singled to left one batter later, and Castro was thrown out by Yoenis Cespedes at the plate.\nThe Mets regained the lead in the bottom of the inning on a pair of one-out singles and Chicago native Curtis Granderson’s two-out, run-scoring hit to center. In between, third baseman Kris Bryant dropped the ball taking it from his glove on a potential inning-ending double play.\nTravis d’Arnaud made it 3-1 with the Mets’ second homer of the game, hitting the giant apple behind the center field fence.\nThe Mets, who clearly didn’t believe Lester’s two throws to first in September proved he had cured his throwing yips, tried to take advantage throughout the game, adding a big insurance run in the seventh after Lagares stole third with one out.\nGranderson followed with a sacrifice fly for a 4-1 lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:29:51.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
