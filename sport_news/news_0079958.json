Hubble Ray Smith Miner Staff Reporter KINGMAN - After successfully moving the ball through the air in the first half, Lee Williams High School got a little pass-happy Friday night against Mohave when it couldn't run effectively enough to protect a lead with five minutes left in the Volunteers' Homecoming Game.It was the Thunderbirds who were flying high after quarterback Oliver Syme connected with tight end Matt McKee for a 20-yard touchdown pass to give Mohave a 27-20 win over Lee Williams, ending the Volunteers' fleeting two-game win streak against cross-town rivals.The Thunderbirds opened the winning drive in Lee Williams' territory after the offense sputtered with an incomplete pass that was nearly intercepted and three penalties that backed the Volunteers inside the 1-yard line, forcing a punt into a strong wind.Lee Williams assistant coach Ray Smith took the blame for the losing strategy, saying he should have called more running plays, which is the Volunteers' strength.\"I didn't call a good game in the second half,\" he said. \"We need to get back to the running game more. We just never got in the groove running the ball.\"Lee Williams scored all three of its touchdowns on throws from junior quarterback Daniel Mazon, who has proven himself to be a capable passer, though he overthrew a few receivers and was nearly intercepted a couple times. Receiver Colin McMullen stripped the ball from a Mohave defender when Mazon threw into dangerous coverage.Mohave took a 6-0 lead on a 27-yard touchdown run by Jason Urquiza, a 5-foot-8, 190-pound senior who was a load to bring down.Lee Williams answered with 4:28 in the first quarter when Mazon hit Nate Cottrell on a tailback delay over the middle, and Cottrell spun and danced free from three Mohave defenders on his way to a 90-yard TD, about 80 yards after the catch. The PAT kick by Drew Lisherness put the Vols up by a point.Urquiza swept around right end for a 5-yard TD to put Mohave back in front, 13-7, in the second quarter, and again, Lee Williams came back with a 25-yard TD strike from Mazon to Justin Sturgill on a post pattern to tie the game at halftime. The score was set up by another long pass caught by Sturgill, a nifty receiver who runs tight routes.Lee Williams recaptured the lead midway through the third quarter as Mazon threw a 16-yard TD to Cottrell, and the PAT kick was good.A short punt gave Mohave good field position at the Volunteers' 35-yard line, and Uquiza caught a swing pass in the right flat and took it 28 yards to the end zone. However, the kick failed and the Vols held a 20-19 lead going into the final period.\"We knew it was going to be a tough bunch of kids over here in their senior class,\" Mohave coach Rudy Olvera said. \"We threw the ball more than we'd like. Our quarterback (Syme) is a 4.0 (GPA) kid and he changed the route to the tight end. He's a 4.0 kid. I trust him.\"The Volunteers played without senior tight end Landon Kramer, who has quit the team as his father, head coach Eugene Kramer, has apparently been replaced by Smith midway through the season.Volunteers senior linebacker Jason Ruiz was part of a defense that came up big at times in stopping Urquiza. He caught Uquiza from behind on a 50-yard scamper down to the 10, and tackled Syme for a loss on a critical fourth-down play.\"They were more physical than us,\" coach Smith said. \"I thought the kids played hard in the second half. We just had way too many penalties. We just didn't make the plays in the second half. We did better in the second half on defense, and on offense, we fell off a little bit. We just didn't execute.\"Cottrell gained 34 yards on 17 carries to lead the Volunteers in rushing, while Mazon completed 10 of 22 passes for 200 yards and three touchdowns. Sturgill caught six passes for 93 yards and a touchdown, and Cottrell had three receptions for 107 yards and two scores.Lee Williams falls to 2-6 overall, 2-3 in section, and plays at Wickenburg (3-5 overall, 2-3 section) at 7 p.m. Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:42:02.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
