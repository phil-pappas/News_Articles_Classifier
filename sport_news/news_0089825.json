The Blue Thunder have a bye next week before closing out the regular season. The defending GISA Class AA state champions should have a bye in the first round of the playoffs before hosting in the second week of November.\n“We had two weeks off to prepare for this game, and I think we showed the ups and downs of having a bye week with all those penalties,” Thompson said. “There were a few questionable calls, but we need to understand the rules and finish our plays better. We’re going to need to make adjustments in all three phases of the game before the playoffs start.”\nThe Blue Thunder dominated with their rushing attack, piling up 272 yards on the ground. Irvin Riley had 80 yards on nine carries, and Mekhi Cooper had 90 yards on six carries, including touchdown runs of 40 and 21 yards.\nMemorial Day led 30-6 at intermission despite being flagged 17 times for 173 yards in the first half.\nThe Blue Thunder got on the board when Adrian Smith hit Delvechio Powell with a 13-yard scoring strike with 3:12 left in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, Cooper found a seam up the right side of the field and turned it into a 21-yard scoring run. Christian Smith’s extra point gave Memorial a 14-0 lead.\nThe Blue Thunder kept the pressure from there as defensive tackle Parker Singletary was all over quarterback Josh Armour a few plays later, with Armour coughing up the ball on the way to the turf. Riley was there for the scoop and score from five yards out. Cooper vaulted over the goal line seconds later for a 2-point conversion as Memorial went up 22-0.\nAdrian Smith lost a fumble deep in Highlander territory midway through the second quarter, but the Blue Thunder defense responded with a three and out. Two plays later, Adrian Smith fired a nice pass to connect with Kawan Williams for a 25-yard touchdown on a post pattern.\nFirst Presbyterian got on the board with 1:03 left in the half on Jamison Golson’s 6-yard touchdown run to cut the Memorial lead to 30-6.\nCooper got the second half started with his 40-yard touchdown run, and Rondell Newsome closed out the scoring for Memorial, taking a reverse in for a 4-yard score in the last seconds of the third quarter.\nThe Blue Thunder defense was strong with four sacks — two from J.B. Powell, one from Singletary and one from Brian Miller, who also had a fumble recovery. Miller has an offer from North Carolina State.\n“We made some mistakes and let our heads drop at times out there today,” said Adrian Smith, who rushed for 49 yards and was 4 of 6 passing for 60 yards and two touchdowns. “But we’re going to get our minds right and keep this momentum going for the rest of the season.”\nFP 0 6 0 2 — 8\nMD 14 16 13 0 — 43\nMD-Delvechio Powell 13 pass from Adrian Smith (Christian Smith kick)\nMD-Mekhi Cooper 21 run (C.
