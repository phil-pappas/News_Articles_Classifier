(AP) â€” Dylan Flores scored in the 82nd minute and Costa Rica tied Haiti 1-1 on Wednesday night in their Group B finale in the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament. Costa Rica and Haiti both lost to Honduras and Mexico in the opening games in Carson, California. Flores lined a shot from just outside the penalty box that goaltender Luis Odelus had no chance of stopping. Pierre Paulson gave Haiti the lead in the 51st minute on a free kick from in close. He lined the ball into the left corner of the goal. Haiti had a chance to win in injury time on a corner kick, but couldn't knock in a loose ball in the box.
