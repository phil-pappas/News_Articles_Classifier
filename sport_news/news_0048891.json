Harrington's record-setting performance earns weekly honor 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nLamar University junior running back Kade Harrington has been named Southland Conference Offensive Player of the Week announced league officials Monday morning. It marks the third time this season Harrington has received the honor. \nJust 24 hours after receiving a national weekly honor from the College Football Performance Awards, Harrington has once again been recognized by the league office for his efforts in the Cardinals 44-28 victory over Abilene Christian Saturday evening. Harrington finished the night with two LU single-game records, an SLC single-game record and an LU career record. \nIn what has become a familiar scene for Cardinals' fans, Harrington dominated the opposing defense in the win. The Kingwood native ran for 347 yards and two touchdowns on 28 carries. He also caught three passes for 18 yards. \nHarrington set a new school and Southland Conference single-game rushing record with his performance against the Wildcats. Already the owner of the second-best single-game mark in school history (set earlier this season at Sam Houston State), Harrington eclipsed a school record which had stood since 1985 (Burton Murchison). \nThe previous Southland record was held by Claude Mathis from Southwest Texas State (now Texas State). He held the record since 1996 when he rushed for 310 yards against Stephen F. Austin. \nHarrington's performance has historical significance as well. It was the 11th-best single-game performance in the history of FCS football, and it tied for the 36th-best game in NCAA Division I history. \nHarrington scored his two touchdowns on runs of 80 and 62 yards, and it was his second run that tied an LU career record for scoring. Harrington now has 198 points in his career which ties Sammy Carpenter who has held the record since 1954. \nHarrington also broke another single-game school record, one which he originally set in the victory over Sam Houston State. He finished the night with 365 all-purpose yards eclipsing his previous record of 313. \nHarrington is one of only two players in the conference averaging better than 100 rushing yards per game, and currently leads the nation averaging better than 166 yards per contest. He is also tied for third nationally with eight rushing touchdowns.
