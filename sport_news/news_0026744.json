Martin Luther King Jr. amid Confederate sculptures at Stone Mountain park.\nOrganizers discussed the issue Wednesday with Gov. Nathan Deal. They hope the Republican governor can stop the process.\nOfficials at the state park have proposed putting a replica Liberty Bell atop the mountain, which also is home to a giant carving of three Confederate leaders.\nThe site long has been controversial in Georgia. For years, the mountain was used for Ku Klux Klan rallies. The state later bought the site. Lawmakers designated it a Confederate memorial and prevented changes to the carving.\nThe June massacre of nine worshippers at a South Carolina church sparked discussions nationwide about Confederate symbols.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
