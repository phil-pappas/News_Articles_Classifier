Navarre shows great defense in win over Milton \n\"It was definitely tough last Friday (vs. Escambia) when Aaron (Mitchell) got hurt,\" Navarre coach Jay Walls said. \"But the credit goes to our kids. They did a good job this week in practice. We had to work some guys at different spots at linebacker, and a couple different guys at running back. We wanted to create some depth and the response by our guys was outstanding.\" \nFrye appears back to health at Escambia \nEscambia (4-4, 0-2) has dealt with its own injury woes, and to make matters worse, it happened to be the area's second leading rusher â€” Jabir Frye. \nBefore suffering an ankle injury two weeks ago at Pine Forest, Frye had carried the ball 80 times for 915 yards and 8 TDs. \nFrye missed Week 7 at Navarre, and no one seemed sure whether or not Jabir Frye would see playing time against Tate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:11:12.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
