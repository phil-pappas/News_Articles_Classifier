Comment   By Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 8:25 PM By Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 8:25 PM ROLLA, Mo. Fans may want to bring a pocket calculator to Lions Memorial Field Friday. There is no guarantee that the scoreboard will survive the expected scoring onslaught. The Rolla High School football team - or at least two-thirds of the roster due to injuries - will be playing one of the state’s highest-scoring teams Friday - as well as perhaps the state’s most porous defense - when it hosts Springfield Glendale. Kickoff for the Ozark Conference game is slated for 7 p.m. Both teams bring in 1-5 overall and conference records into the contest. Last week the Bulldogs were beaten on the road by Camdenton 43-15 while Glendale was outscored by Springfield rival Parkview 56-44. Rolla has struggled keeping opponents out of the endzone this fall, allowing an average of 35.5 points per game. However, compared to the Falcons, the Bulldogs resemble the ‘85 Chicago Bears. It’s all about offense for Glendale, as the Falcons average a staggering 43.7 points per game, and have single-game point totals of 62, 58, 48 and 44 so far this season. However, on the other side of the ball the Falcons are giving up an even more staggering 52.2 points per game, having allowed one-game totals of 71, 63, 56 and 56 this fall. When the two teams got together last year in Springfield, Glendale defeated Rolla 72-65 - then the third highest-scoring game in Missouri prep football history. “It’s about like playing basketball,” said RHS head coach Willie Howard. “You speed it up and run as fast as you can. You go in knowing you’re going to give up some; you just hope your offense is clicking.” Earlier this season the Falcons bolted to a 22-0 lead over league co-leader West Plains, on the strength of a couple of West Plains turnovers. The Zizzers eventually settled down, went to their power offense and churned out 71 points of their own. Glendale has run the extreme spread formation the past two years under head coach Mike Mauk, father of Mizzou quarterback Maty Mauk. This season the Falcons don’t even bother to pretend...they’re going to pass on every down. Howard says the Falcons haven’t lined up a running back in the backfield the entire season, and the only rushing attempts come on a quarterback keeper or some sort of receiver end-around. It’s been a difficult week for the Falcon program. Mike Mauk underwent surgery on Monday as part of treatment for colorectal cancer. Reports indicate that the surgery went well. Serving as interim head coach while Mike is sidelined his his son, assistant coach Ben Mauk, like his brother a former NCAA Division I quarterback. Page 2 of 3 - So what makes the Falcon spread so much tougher to stop that other spread offenses? “It’s the fact they stretch the field everywhere,” Howard said. “It puts you on your heels, then you end up playing their game at their tempo. They can sustain that pace; you end up not sustaining that pace.” Also, Glendale uses the on-side kick as a weapon throughout the game, trying to force turnovers to get the ball back quickly. As a result, Glendale’s offense features cartoonish numbers. Falcon sophomore quarterback Alex Huston tops the state in passing numbers, having completed 236-of-361 passes for 3,036 yards, 11 interceptions and 35 touchdowns. Huston leads the team in rushing with 184 yards on 24 carries. Glendale has three receivers who have caught at least 54 passes. Junior wideout Luke Montgomery is the state’s top receiver with 74 catches for 1,210 yards and 16 TDs while junior Von Oeser has 56 receptions for 548 yards and six TDs; junior wideout Jeremy Almeida 54 for 493 and six TDs; senior wideout Zach Helm 25 for 463 and four TDs, and senior wideout Reuben Lopez 19 for 244 and three TDs. Defensively the Falcons run a 4-3. Glendale junior linebacker Kyle Doran is credited with 39 solo tackles and 86 assists while junior defensive back Carson Liston has 28 solos and 43 assists and junior linebacker Ian Marshall 13 and 30. The Falcons have recorded six QB sacks and two interceptions. “The Montgomery kid is a very good receiver,” Howard said. “He can rip off 60 yards quick. Their quarterback does an exceptional job keeping plays alive. “They put their defense in bad spots because they on-side kick almost every time. They look physical on film, but have had a hard time stopping people.” How many healthy bodies Rolla will have to throw at Glendale is in question, as injuries have piled up. Here is the Bulldog injury report: *Starters or key personnel out for tonight’s game include junior lineman Colton Headrick (concussion), senior receiver-linebacker Brett Hoffman (concussion), senior lineman Zak Phillips (concussion), junior running back Curtis Martin (shoulder), senior running back-safety Lee Clancy (knee) and sophomore defensive back Davis Buhr (knee). *Questionable for Friday are senior defensive back Adam Dent (concussion) and senior lineman Jorge Barrera (concussion). *Probable to play with injuries are senior quarterback Kyle Morris (ankle) and senior wideout-QB-linebacker Zach Brown (shoulder). *Out for the season with various injuries are Buhr, Clancy, junior lineman Brandon Frazier, junior lineman Levi Crum, sophomore lineman Ryker Wilson, sophomore lineman Isaac Stormes, sophomore QB-DB Caleb Turner and sophomore WR-LB Austin Jones. That’s well over a third of the roster either out or questionable to play. Morris has completed 85-of-143 passes for 787 yards, seven interceptions and five touchdowns while rushing for 261 yards on 78 attempts and four TDs. Page 3 of 3 - Senior Wyatt Kinder leads the Bulldogs in rushing with 263 yards on 54 attempts. Senior wideout Keegan Chrisco has 29 catches for 315 yards and four TDs while Brown has 28 catches for 324 yards and a TD and senior wideout Josh Leon 21 catches for 136 yards and one TD. Senior end/linebacker Evan Voight has 17 solo tackles and 43 assists to pace the Bulldog defense while junior linebacker Xaviar Douglas has 15 and 19 and sophomore linebacker Ryan Smith eight and 26.
