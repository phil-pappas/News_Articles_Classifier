By RALPH D. RUSSOAP College Football Writer \nOhio State remained No. 1 in The Associated Press college football Top 25 and tied a poll record on Sunday, despite lagging support from the voters. \nMeanwhile, No. 2 TCU and No. 3 Baylor edged forward, No. 4 Michigan State slipped and No. 5 Utah and No. 6 Clemson took big jumps. \nAfter four top-10 teams lost on Saturday, the rankings were rattled and five teams received first-place votes. The Buckeyes received 38 first-place votes, their fewest this season after beginning as the first unanimous preseason No. 1. TCU has five first-place votes, Baylor received 10, Utah has seven and No. 9 Texas A&M has one. \nOhio State was the only team in the top 16 to have the same ranking this week as last. \nThe Buckeyes held off Indiana 34-27 on Saturday and have now been top-ranked 101 times, matching Oklahoma for the most in the 79-year history of the media poll. \n___ \nPOLL POINTS \nOne more week at No. 1 will give Ohio State a record all to itself. The most times being on top of the AP poll. \n101 - Oklahoma", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:38:28.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
