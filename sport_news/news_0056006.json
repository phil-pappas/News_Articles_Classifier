But the upcoming NCAA Pre-Nationals in Louisville represents the Jayhawks’ toughest test to date. The meet features 12 of the top 30 men’s teams and eight of the top 30 women’s teams. Included on the men’s side is national number one Colorado and number two Oregon. The race, hosted by Louisville at H.P. “Tom” Sawyer State Park, will mark the third meet of the Jayhawks’ season and the first outside the confines of Rim Rock Farm, where Kansas has enjoyed remarkable success. Senior Evan Landes captured a win for the men’s side in the Rim Rock Classic, while sophomore Lydia Saggau and freshman Sharon Lokedi took individual titles at the Bob Timmons Classic and Rim Rock Classic respectively. While the men’s and women’s teams both come into H.P. Sawyer Park with high expectations, the Pre Nationals represents a nearly polar opposite point in the season for both teams. The men rely heavily on their star powered senior class, which includes race winner Evan Landes and regional star Jacob Morgan. Morgan was an All Conference and All Region runner last season, while Evan Landes has already captured an individual victory this season. The women’s team, on the other hand, is seeing a youth movement. Their two race-winners this season have both been underclassmen. And now they’ll be joined by sophomore Alaina Schroeder at the top of the field. Juniors Nashia and Malika Baker will also be at the top of the field for the Kansas women. The NCAA Pre Nationals will serve as a great barometer for the Jayhawks in terms of seeing where they rank among the nation's elite teams. Both teams are aiming for top 50 finishes in the NCAA Nationals later in November, which are also at H.P. Sawyer Park in Louisville. The men will run an 8K, beginning at 8:30 a.m., and the women will run a 6K, beginning at 9:45 a.m. on Saturday, October 17. \n0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:16:18.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
