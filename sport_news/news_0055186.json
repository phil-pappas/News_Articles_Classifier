The redshirt freshman beat out junior Chauncey Briggs, but coach Chad Morris said they are locked in a tight competition. \"The door opened up for him, he took advantage of it and he doesn't want to give it up,\" Morris said. \"It's a daily competition. That's when you know you're getting better, when you've got guys competing at every spot.\"\nThe Mustangs were intent on improving their third-down performance after converting only 2-of-14 attempts in last week's loss to East Carolina. They converted their first six in taking a 14-7 lead. Their second drive produced third-down gains of 17 yards by Prescott Line, Shelby Walkers' 33-yard reception and Ryheem Malone's 9-yard touchdown catch.\nSMU WR Ryheem Malone came up big in his return to his hometown. The sophomore from Houston Bellaire caught a 9-yard touchdown pass from Matt Davis for a 14-7 lead with 5:24 left in the first quarter. Malone played in five games last season after transferring from Houston, making five catches. He entered Thursday's game as SMU's second-leading receiver with 13 catches for 163 yards and one TD.\nGreg Ward scored on a one-yard keeper around left end to give Houston a 28-21 with two seconds left in the first half. Ward surpassed Case Keenum on the school's all-time list for rushing touchdowns in one season for a quarterback with 10.\nAfter catching a touchdown pass in each of SMU's first four games, Courtland Sutton ended his streak last week against East Carolina. Sutton, though, opened the scoring by catching an eight-yard touchdown pass from Matt Davis.\nHouston 49, SMU 28: Complete coverage\nClick here to visit the Mustangs page\nNichols: Mistakes plague SMU in 49-28 loss to UH; Cougars rush for 7 TDs\nSMU quick hits: Mustangs' offense improves on third down; WR's homecoming a success\nNational reaction: Lack of defense in SMU-Houston game was 'laughable'\nPhotos: Mistakes doom SMU in 49-28 loss to UH\nFive thoughts from the SMU Mustang's 49-28 loss to the Houston Cougars\nOn Twitter:\n @BillNicholsDMN", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/five-thoughts-smus-49-28-loss-houston", "https://twitter.com/BillNicholsDMN", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/10/09/photos-mistakes-doom-smu-49-28-loss-uh", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/smu-mustangs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/smu-quick-hits-mustangs-offense-improves-third-wrs-homecoming-success", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/nichols-mistakes-plague-smu-49-28-loss-uh-cougars-rush-7-tds", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/national-reaction-lack-defense-smu-houston-game-laughable"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:12:41.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
