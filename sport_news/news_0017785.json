Jerry Brown signed legislation barring public schools from using the Redskins name for sports teams.\nIt was one of three sports-related bills Brown recently approved. He also signed a measure that bans using or possessing smokeless tobacco on the playing field at professional baseball parks and another that recognizes competitive cheerleading as a high school sport.\nThe mascot legislation will prevent public schools from using a term that American Indians regard as offensive. It goes into effect in 2017.\nOnly four schools still use the name. Messages seeking comment from school officials were not immediately returned Monday, a federal holiday.\nBrown rejected separate legislation that bans naming parks, schools and other public property after Confederate leaders.\nThis story has been corrected to show the bills were approved recently, not all on Sunday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
