The St. Louis Cardinals (Matt Carpenter, Peter Bourjos and Jhonny Peralta) and the Tampa Bay Rays (Curt Casali, two) tagged Price for more than one homer as a member of the Detroit Tigers. He allowed two homers in three post-season starts with the Jays: Rougned Odor and Robinson Chirinos of the Texas Rangers in Game 1 of the ALDS, plus Mike Moustakas and Ben Zobrist in Game 6. \nTHREE players older than Jose Bautista, 35, who had more than one homer and knocked in three runs in a post-season game. The oldest was Babe Ruth, 37, in Game 3 of the 1932 World Series when he homered twice against Charlie Root in a 7-5 win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. \nFOUR starters that the Jays have under contract for next season in Marcus Stroman, R.A. Dickey, Aaron Sanchez and Drew Hutchison. The Jays are expected to pick up the $12-million option on Dickey. Do they convert Robert Osuna into a starter? That’s only 484 innings and 35 wins for pitching coach Pete Walker to work with. \nSEVEN homers by Royals hitters (two each by Salvador Perez and Zobrist, one apiece from Kendrys Morales, Moustakas and Alex Rios) is one more than the Jays (two from Jose Bautista, one each by Troy Tulowitzki, Ryan Goins, Josh Donaldson and Chris Colabello). \nNINE more hits that the Royals had with men in scoring position (20-for-48, zero homers, 25 RBIs, .417) than the Jays (11-for-58, two homers, 19 RBIs, .190). \nFOURTEEN of 17 Royals hitters retired by Price after two solo homers put Toronto down 2-0. \nFIFTEEN stops LaTroy Hawkins made before leaving the visiting clubhouse: 1) The umpire’s room for a final time, thanking them for their work over the years. Of the six umps only John Hirschbeck was in the game when Hawkins broke in with the 1995 Minnesota Twins; 2) Manager John Gibbons’ office; 3) Hugged Jays president Paul Beeston; The other stops were to players lockers on his way out. \nTWENTY percent chance the Jays had of winning with Dalton Pompey on third after two stolen bases and Kevin Pillar on second after a walk and a stolen base with Donaldson at the plate. \nTWENTY Players scored from first on a single during the 2015 season. Lorenzo Cain did it twice in the post season including the winning run in the eighth. \nTWENTY ONE less strikeouts by Royals hitters (35) compared to Toronto batters (56). \nTHIRTY years since the Royals defeated the St. Louis Cardinals to win their only World Series and on the 30th anniversary of Dick Howser’s Royals beating Whitey Herzog’s Cards, the New York Mets visit Kauffman Stadium on Tuesday night to open the World Series. \nTHIRTY TWO million U.S. dollars in pitching coming off the books for 2016 in the free-agent departures (for now) of Mark Buehrle, Marco Estrada, Mark Lowe, Jeff Francis and Price. Buehrle’s future is uncertain. He might pitch next year, but he won’t be like Brett Farve or Roger Clemens, announce his retirement and then change his mind. He arrived in the spring of 2013 and had the clubhouse laughing within minutes. As he threw a duffle bag over his shoulder he yelled, “See you in spring training.” \nFORTY FIVE percent chance the Jays had of winning with Pompey on third and Pillar on second. \nFIFTY FOUR days between Rogers Communications naming Mark Shapiro as their new president to replace Beeston. Still GM Alex Anthopoulos has still not been told his duties for next season. Is he back? Is he back under a reduced role similar to the Boston Red Sox situation with Ben Cherington when Dave Dombrowksi took over. Cherington left the day Dombrowksi took over. \nFIFTY FIVE percent chance the Jays had of winning with Pompey on third and Pillar on first with pinch hitter Dioner Navarro at the plate. \nSIXTY points by which the K.C. outhit the Jays. Royals hitters batted .294 (59-for-201) with nine doubles, one triple, seven homers, 35 RBIs and a .786 OPS) compared to Toronto who hit .234 (12 doubles, six homers, 26 RBIs and a .709 OPS). What a wonderful season it was!
