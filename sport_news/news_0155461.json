(Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press) Related Stories Canadian women's basketball team wins Olympic spot \nTeam Canada forward Natalie Achonwa can make history this weekend for the second time in her life and she's not fazed. Not even a little. \nAchonwa, 23, plays centre on the WNBA's Indiana Fever, whose series final begins this weekend against the Minnesota Lynx. If Achonwa and the Fever take the title, the Guelph Ont., native will be the first Canadian woman to have won a Pan Am gold, FIBA gold and WNBA gold in a single year. Can't see on mobile?

Even then she felt no pressure to perform. \n\"There was never pressure in those moments because I was a 16-year old girl playing amongst professional athletes\", Achonwa told CBC Sports. \n\"I was never looked upon to take over, be the star. I was in a situation where I got to learn.\" \nThat is part of the reason she is in such a great position now on Team Canada. Achonwa has been on the team for five years, but still calls herself a \"young vet.\" \n\"I'm up there in terms of years on the team. But at the same time I'm still young. So I get to play a good role,\" she said. \n\"I get to lead by example and at the same time get to sit back and let [14-year Team Canada veteran] Kim Gaucher run us and keep us focused. \n\"I'm fortunate enough to play with such amazing leaders that it's never fully weighted on my shoulders.\" Looks at Team Canada experiences as separate season \nThe Fever begin a five-game series on Sunday. It will be the third major tournament Achonwa has played in the last three months, but takes the pressure off the third gold by not associating her work with the Fever with that of Team Canada. \n\"You have to,\" said Achonwa, adding she looks at them as two separate seasons. \n\"Although the skills that I learn in each overlap and help me to play better in each season, in terms of accomplishment and in terms of what you do in the individual tournaments, they have no connection with each other.\" \nAchonwa can add the Pan Ams and FIBA Americas to the list of experiences she pulls on not only in the upcoming finals, but as well as at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. — @NatAchon \nThe Summer Games will be her second, though Achonwa anticipates a different experience. \n\"The last time we went to the Olympics in 2012, we qualified on Canada Day, literally two weeks before we left for London,\" she said. \"We were one of the last teams to qualify. We were just happy to be there.\" \nThis time, the team qualified a year in advance. \n\"So not only do we get the time to build a team and build on the momentum of this summer, but we also get the resources, the media coverage,\" she said. \"There's a lot of time and energy that our performance team will put into making sure we're ready to compete for a medal this time around.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:29:05.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
