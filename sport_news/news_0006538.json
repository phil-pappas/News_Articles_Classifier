Related Links Coal City football falls to Lisle \nThere have been times in 2015 when Onsen has seen his Coalers look perfectly capable of playing with elite Class 3A and 4A competition – the kind of competition they will face Friday at 9-0 Marengo in the first round of the 4A playoffs. \nThen there have been times when the Coalers have made the kind of mistakes that have doomed them to an 0-4 record against playoff teams this season. \nEliminating those mistakes, Onsen says, is the No. 1 key for the Coalers to pull off a first-round upset and make a run in the playoffs. \n“It’s been a lack of consistency and making plays – we’re just not making plays,”Onsen said. “Every phase of the game just not clicking on the same page. We’re just not good enough right now. We’ve got to work hard and get to be.” \nTwo of the Coalers’ four losses – 56-13 to Plano and 34-6 to Manteno – would seem to indicate they have played at a level well short of that needed to succeed in the playoffs. \nBut Coal City is the same team that lost a 20-16 Week 2 thriller to defending 3A state champion Wilmington, which went on to finish 9-0 in the regular season. \nCoal City also lost by a four-point margin, 7-3, when it took on a Lisle team that finished 7-2. \nThe Coalers allowed 158 points this season, which was the lowest total in the Interstate Eight Large, and their defensive efforts in the Wilmington and Lisle games could be seen as indicators that they can stay in games with tough opponents. \nBut even on that side of the ball, Onsen believes more consistency is needed for them to have a chance. \n“In some of these games, we’re playing good defense, but then it’ll be third-and-10 and we’ll have a breakdown,” Onsen said. “Like the one drive in the Lisle (game) where they scored, it was a third-and-10. If we make the play, break up a pass, stop them from getting the first down, then they don’t score. … The Wilmington game, fourth-and-12, you know, (Nick) Hawkins goes for 17 for a touchdown. … OK, it’s a third-and-short for us, and then we’ll have a silly penalty – just things like that.” \nFor Coal City’s Week 9 opponent, Seneca, the results have been anything but consistent – at least in a positive sense – as the Fighting Irish lost each of their last six games by at least 22 points. \nBut as the Irish closed out an injury-riddled season against three playoff opponents, coach Ted O’Boyle says that their fight was regularly there, even if the wins were not. \n“It says a lot about the character of some guys that know that you don’t have a tomorrow no matter what happens in a game – there’s no playoffs, there’s no regionals, there’s nothing when you have the record that we have,” O’Boyle said. “You don’t tell it by the scoreboard because we’re playing Wilmington, we’re playing Plano, we’re playing Coal City, but effort-wise, the last three games were as good an effort as we’ve given all season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:01:49.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
