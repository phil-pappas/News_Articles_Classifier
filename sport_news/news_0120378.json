The victory pushed USF’s record to 7-0, including 3-0 and a first place tie in the NSIC South with Minnesota State. The Cougars have now won 19-of-20 games and improved to 4-0 in road games this season. This is the second consecutive season that USF has opened 7-0. USF head coach Jed Stugart, who improved to 51-13 at USF and 77-20 overall, was pleased with the workmanlike performance of his team. “I am proud of you guys,” said Stugart in a postgame celebration huddle on the field with his team. “We played a talented and hot team on their field and came away with a victory. It was great to see you rise up at crucial moments to put up another 1-0 week,” he said. USF, which never trailed, opened up a 27-7 lead in the third quarter and then held off SMSU. The Mustangs pulled within eight with 6:04 to play, but the Cougars responded the way they always do. Led by junior quarterback Luke Papilion, USF ran out the clock except for the final three seconds. In fact on a 4th and 22 and 24 seconds left on the clock, Papilion ran off 21 seconds of the clock by navigating back and forth across the field before being stopped for a one yard gain and just enough time for SMSU to run one play from their own 25-yard line. For the 10th straight game, USF had more than 400 yards in total offense, finishing with 483 on 80 plays. Papilion, who completed 20-of-34 passes for 225 yards and two TDs, rushed 17 times for 92 yards and a TD while sophomore Max Mickey returned to the lineup to lead USF with 14 carries for 99 yards. Add Justin Fulks’ 14 carries for 64 yards and a TD and USF had 46 totes for 258 yards and three TDs. Papilion, a Harlon Hill candidate, pushed his career passing mark to 5,433 yards, a total which ranks sixth on the Cougars’ career passing list. He also became just the second quarterback in USF history with 5,000 yards passing and 2,000 yards rushing (Dax Michelena, 1997-2001, 2,755 rushing yards, 7,665 passing yards). Papilion has 2,075 yards for 10th all-time on the USF rushing chart. He is just three yards from overtaking current running backs coach Kristian Porter (2008-12, 2077 yards) for ninth on that all-time list. Junior wide out Josh Angulo led the USF’s receiving corps with six catches for 77 yards and a TD. Angulo moved into seventh place all-time at USF with 121 career catches and now has 1,736 receiving yards, which ranks just 16 yards from sixth all-time (Trey Erickson, 2003-07, 1,751). Sophomore tight end Nick Stanke had a season-best five catches for 38 yards while Brady Rose had two catches for 33 yards, which pushed him over 100 career catches (101). While the offense was doing its normal thing, the Cougars’ defense, led by sophomore safety Josh Butler also asserted itself in the win. Butler had a career-best 13 tackles while recording a sack, TFL, two forced fumbles and three pass breakups. He led a defense that limited SMSU to a season-low 95 rushing yards. Senior linebacker Carter Ahlers and senior defensive tackle Grant Schindler added eight tackles each. Ahlers and Schindler were among six Cougars to register a sack. In addition, the Cougars stopped the Mustangs on four-of-five 4th down plays in the first half (3-of-7 overall). Early on, the Cougars quickly put up the first TD of the game. Papilion connected with senior wide out Garrett Shutt on a 38-yard TD strike for a 7-0 lead just 1:44 into the game. But the homestanding Mustangs answered when Davontay Stevens had a 18-yard TD reception from Blake Gimbel to cap a nine-play, 75-yard scoring drive. Late in the first quarter, the Cougars' defense Stevens for no gain on a 4th and one at their own 49-yard line. From there, USF quickly built the lead to 14-7. First, Max Mickey rumbled 32-yards to the SMSU 12 yard line. Five plays later, Papilion scored his sixth rushing TD - a one yard plunge - of the season to cap a 49-yard drive in 1:53. USF added to the lead early in the second quarter when USF again used a short field after a 23-yard punt by SMSU’s Austin Wells. Using just 2:50 off the clock, Papilion capped a eight-play, 50-yard drive by tossing a 17-yard TD strike to Angulo. The TD pushed USF's lead to 20-7 at the 11:16 mark of the second quarter. The Cougars took that advantage to the halftime break. After stopping SMSU on the opening drive of the second half, USF again added to their lead when Jonathon Witt scored his third TD in four games. Witt’s score at the 12:06 mark capped an eight-play, 47-yard drive in 1:59 as USF took a 27-7 lead. But SMSU, which was coming off a 61-3 win over Wayne State, was not finished on their Senior Night. Tommy Steidler caught a four-yard TD pass from Gimbel, who was 38-of-52 for a career-high 384 yards, at the 9:09 mark of the third quarter. Then late in the third quarter, SMSU went on a 15-play, 99-yard drive to move closer. Stevens, the league’s leading rusher (averaging 110 yards per game), who was held to 57 yards on 19 carries, scored on a two-yard run with :35 seconds left in the third quarter to cut USF’s lead to 27-19. Facing a little adversity, the Cougars answered with a stop on defense, created in part by Marco Naughton’s sack of Gimbel at the SMSU 11-yard line. A 31 yard punt by Wells set up USF at the SMSU 42-yard line. Four plays later, Fulks scored on a 21-yard TD scamper for a 34-19 lead with 12:50 to play in the fourth quarter. SMSU had one final charge as Davion Shelton hauled in a 11-yard TD pass from Gimbel with 6:04 to play. But USF’s offense dashed any Mustangs’ hopes with a clock-eating drive that took all but the final 3.3 seconds off the clock. USF now returns home to host city rival Augustana in the Key to the City game at 2:30 p.m., on Saturday, Oct. 24 from Bob Young Field. The game will also be USF’s Hall of Fame game when seven individuals with ties to the athletic department are honored on a Friday night ceremony at the McDonald's Center and during halftime of the USF-Augustana matchup.
