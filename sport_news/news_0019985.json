Barrera had a match-high 26 digs to go with an ace and three assists. “Jazmin Barrera had a really, really good night for us,” Broncos coach Jared Rudiger said. “Jazmin played very good, disciplined defense.” Rudiger’s squad gave up just one ace. Platte Valley improved to 9-3 in league, 14-4 overall, evening the season series against the Bulldogs. University fell to 8-2, 10-2. Bulldogs coach Lindsey Brown said her team lacked energy in front of a packed house, as the Broncos hosted their annual Cancer Awareness Match. “We came in a little flat,” Brown said. “We just made a lot of unforced errors.” Platte Valley made sophomore Bo Miller its honorary team captain. Miller is battling Leukemia after being diagnosed this past summer.
