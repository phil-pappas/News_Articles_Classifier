(AP Photo/Antonio Calanni) \nAfter drubbing Olimpia Milano in a preseason opener earlier this week, Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens will stick with the same starting lineup against Real Madrid. Marcus Smart, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, David Lee and Tyler Zeller will start tonight for the Celtics. â€” Boston Celtics (@celtics) October 8, 2015 \nStevens had earlier considered experimenting with the first unit. Injuries and sickness could be factors as Evan Turner (a starter from last season) and Amir Johnson (the biggest free-agent acquisition) will both miss the game. Perry Jones is also out due to a death in his family. \nBut again, Stevens will go with three guys who started last season (Smart, Bradley and Zeller), allowing most of the powerful bench to stay intact. When super sixth man Isaiah Thomas isn't on the court, the Celtics could want to run a lot of offense through Lee. Stevens has stressed how much he appreciates the big man's playmaking. \nStevens could still shake things up, of course, as Boston's roster has very little separation almost from top to bottom. But his rotation should start to emerge as the preseason continues, and might be forming already.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:11:13.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
