But what about the Dutch mule, made with one of the Netherland's most popular exports, juniper-forward gin? It's on the menu at Revival Social Club, a neighborhood spot in Edgewater.\nTim Wells, head mixologist as RSC, said he hopes the drink gets gin skeptics to rethink the spirit. \"I wanted to create a drink that wouldn't mask all the flavors of the gin, but rather highlight what really makes it great.\"\nThe Nolet's Dutch mule ($10) marries classic Nolet's gin — the distillery, founded in 1691, is the oldest in Holland — with a touch of Dolin Blanc vermouth, a hint of lemon, a snap of peach bitters and a fizzy top of ginger beer for a drink as crisp and refreshing as a bike ride through Amsterdam on a perfect fall day. 1133 W.
