You've got the rugby markings and a bit of damage from the games, which is what we knew would happen and we will tend to throughout the week. \n\"We worked pretty late through the double-header - that was always going to be the case. Two games in two days of any sport is a lot for a pitch to take. It's just general wear in high-traffic areas that we really have to tend to. \n\"By Sunday it will be looking fantastic.\" \nSome onlookers expressed concern at seeing Tully and fellow staff on the pitch during breaks in play in the trio of rugby fixtures. \nBut he added: \"That's just what you've got to do. \n\"It's best that we were going on during the games, instead of rugby players stamping on divots, putting them back in upside down or anything like that. \n\"We were going on, tending to them properly and putting them back in the right way up, so they had more of a chance to recover.\" \nNewcastle are currently bottom of the Premier League and still looking for their first top-flight win of the season.
