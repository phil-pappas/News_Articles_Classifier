A total of 610 million people in South Asia do not have toilets,\" UNICEF said. \nIn Sri Lanka some 14 percent of households in the nation of 20 million lack toilets, UNICEF said. \nLocal cricket legend Muttiah Muralitharan has also been enlisted to support the \"wash in school\" drive in Sri Lanka.
