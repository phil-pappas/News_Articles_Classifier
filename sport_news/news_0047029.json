Whether or not that's justified is up to you (there's probably a good argument you could come up with for each side). But the fact that he seemingly doesn't have LeBron James' respect was likely the cause for that belief. There were numerous reports throughout the year that seemed to indicate Blatt was a figurehead while James was the squad's real coach. And the two couldn't get together on anything, even a fucking high five\nNow that that's been summarized we bring you a Cleveland player who actually appears to respect the coach, and it's a guy who's certainly had his brushes with authority : J.R. Smith . Said Smith about Blatt:\n\" First things first, before we get into basketball, Coach really cares about me as a person. That's one of the first coaches I've had that actually cared about me off the court more than on the court, so it was that much easier for me to play for him and give my all because I know he cares about me as a person. When you have someone like that behind you it's so much easier just to play. I'd run through a brick wall for Coach. \"\nThe love is clearly there for Blatt off the court, which matches their chemistry whilst Smith is on it, largely due to the fact that the Cavs' official sideline general doesn't micromanage:\n\" He just lets me play. He tells me to make the best basketball play possible. He doesn't tell me not to shoot or when to shoot. He tells me to make the best basketball play. He trusts me with that.\"\nSounds like this is about as good of a player-coach relationship as Smith and/or Blatt is going to get. We guess it's a good thing for everyone but J.R.'s bank account that he decided to return .\n[via Cleveland.com ]\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/10/jr_smith_on_david_blatt_id_run.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:24:14.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
