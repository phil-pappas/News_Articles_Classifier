(Tony Gutierrez/The Associated Press) Related Stories \nThe Toronto Blue Jays beat the Texas Rangers 5-1 on Sunday to force a Game 4 in their American League Division Series. \nTexas still leads the best-of-five set 2-1. Game 4 goes Monday at Globe Life Park in Arlington. \nTroy Tulowitzki hit a three-run home run and finished with four runs batted in to lead Toronto's offence. \nBlue Jays righty Marco Estrada went 6 1/3 inning and gave up one earned run on five hits with four strikeouts and no walks. He retired the first eight batters of the game before Hanser Alberto hit a two-out double in the bottom of the third. \nTexas lefty Martin Perez tossed five innings, allowing four earned runs on six hits with two strikeouts and three walks. \nDioner Navarro scored Toronto's first run in the third inning on a fielder's choice. Navarro doubled to open the inning and came home two batters later when Ryan Goins grounded into a double play. \nJosh Donaldson scored the second run for the Blue Jays after starting the fourth inning with a lead-off double and advancing to third on a Jose Bautista fly out. Three straight walks to Edwin Encarnacion, Chris Colabello and Tulowitzki put Toronto ahead 2-0. Perez limited anymore damage by getting Navarro to ground into an inning-ending double play. \nDonaldson singled to open the sixth and was moved to third on another single from Bautista, ending Perez's night. \nRighty Chi Chi Gonzalez replaced Perez and walked Encarnacion to load the bases, but got Colabello to ground into Toronto's fourth double play of the game. Gonzalez looked to be out of the jam but Tulowitzki took him deep on a 3-1 pitch to make it 5-0. \nTexas sparked some life in the bottom of the seventh when Elvin Andrus singled and then went first to third on a Josh Hamilton single. Hamilton ended up at second on the play after Bautista bobbled the ball in right field. \nThat forced Estrada out of the game. He was replaced by lefty Aaron Loup, who got Delino DeShields to ground into a fielders choice that scored Andrus from third.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:39:59.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
