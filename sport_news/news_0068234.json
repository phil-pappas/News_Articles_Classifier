The Skinny: The Bengals are the only team in the NFL that hasn't made a roster move since the season began, and it's because they have dealt with very few injuries. Only one key player was made inactive for a game and that came this past Sunday when nickel defensive back Leon Hall was scratched due to a back issue. \n-- Andy Dalton's performance The Skinny: It's not just that Dalton ranks second in the NFL in passer rating at 116.1, it's how consistent he has been in compiling that number. His worst single-game rating was a 95.9 against Seattle and he had a near perfect rating in the fourth quarter and overtime. In each of the other five games his rating was 115.9 or higher, and he threw at least one touchdown pass in all six games and at least two in five games. He is on pace to throw for 4,696 yards, 37 touchdowns and only five interceptions. The good health has certainly helped Dalton as the return of tight end Tyler Eifert and Marvin Jones have been a big boost to the offense. Eifert, who missed all but the first quarter of the 2014 season is on pace for 75 receptions, 912 yards and 16 touchdowns, and Jones, who missed all of 2014, is on pace for 64 receptions, 856 yards and eight touchdowns. \n-- The first six opponents weren't as tough as they appeared when the season began The Skinny: Heading into Sunday's games the combined record of the Bengals' first six opponents was just 12-24. That said, Oakland is much improved from last season and each of the other five teams (San Diego, Baltimore, Kansas City, Seattle and Buffalo) was over .500 last season. It should also be noted that each of the four other teams that entered Sunday unbeaten had faced teams with a compsite record of under .500. New England's opponents were a combined 13-16; Denver's were a combined 10-24; Carolina's were a combined 9-20 and Green Bay's were a combined 11-24. \nTHREE THINGS THAT WENT WRONG \n-- Jeremy Hill struggled running the ball The Skinny: Hill had a spectacular rookie season in which he rushed for 1,124 yards and 5.1 yards per carry and that was even with him being the focus of defenses due to all the injuries to key offensive players, but this season with those weapons back he rushed for just 232 yards and averaged 3.1 per carry in the first six games. He has run very tentatively after losing two fumbles in the second game of the season against San Diego and doesn't appear to be as comfortable running out of the shotgun as out of the I formation like he did last season. \n-- The defense allowed way too many big plays The Skinny: Defensive coordinator Paul Guenther openly lamented that issue prior to the Buffalo game, and then the Bengals allowed four plays of 20 yards or more (which is classified as a \"big play\" by NFL standards). They have allowed the fourth most running plays of 20 yards or more (seven), are tied for 14th in most pass plays of 20 yards or more allowed (19) and ninth in most pass plays of 40 yards or more allowed (five). \n-- Too many third quarter offensive lulls The Skinny: Perhaps this past Sunday's game in Buffalo was a sign that this is going to change, because the Bengals outscored the Bills 14-0 in the third quarter and outgained them 168-40. In the first five games they had been outscored in the third quarter in three of them and by a combined 31-27. \nTHREE QUESTIONS STILL TO ANSWER \n-- How much did the schedule play a role in the 6-0 start? The Skinny: It's a legitimate question ask, but I do believe some of those first six teams are far better than their record indicates. The Bengals will find out quickly though as their first game out of the bye is on the road at Pittsburgh, which will be over .500 when that game is played no matter what the Steelers do on Sunday in Kansas City. \n-- When will linebacker Vontaze Burfict return and how much of an impact will he have? The Skinny: Burfict was eligible to come off the PUP list during the bye week and wisely wasn't activated from it, because when he is activated he has a three-week window to practice before he has to be placed on season-ending injured reserve or be placed on the active roster. It's possible he's activated this coming week, but not a guarantee and there's really no rush until he completely 100 percent healthy. You would think once he is healthy he would have some level of impact, but he is coming off knee surgery and that usually takes a year or more to return to full speed. \n-- How will this team react to playing with a target on its back? The Skinny: The Bengals have ascended into the NFL's elite and with that comes opponents having a little sharper focus and desire when they play them. There is a large core of players who have been part of four straight playoff appearances so they should know how to handle it and they've done it several times already this season. They didn't allow the Kansas City game to be a \"trap game,\" and they didn't have a let down at Buffalo after the comeback win over Seattle.
