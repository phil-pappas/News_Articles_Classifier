Actually, his ability to contribute any way possible after missing the second half of last season to have back surgery is encouraging. Hanzal's seven points to start the season are the most during any four-game stretch of his career.\n“His assists are coming more from doing good work in the defensive zone and supporting in the middle and things like that,” Tippett said. “They’re not what you’d call great pin-point passing there. It’s doing hard work to allow those guys to get space. Marty’s been really good so far this year.”\nHanzal hasn’t had any hiccups with his back. What’s more, he arrives early to squeeze in 45 minutes of extra stretching and does another 30 minutes of work after he leaves the ice in attempt to ward off any potential problems.\n“When I’m healthy, I’m having fun and I can play,” he said. “That was the biggest issue with me a couple years in a row. Now I have no issues, so I’m ready to go every night.”\nReunion time\nArizona mixed up its defensive pairings ahead of Saturday’s game, reuniting Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Zbynek Michalek and inserting Michael Stone next to Klas Dahlbeck .\nThe move was intended to spark Ekman-Larsson, whose play to start the season was characterized as “just all right,” by Tippett.\n“We gotta get him a little more focused on the hard parts of the game,” Tippett explained.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Coyotes' strong start kindles optimism\nEntering action Saturday, Ekman-Larsson had one goal and paced all blue liners in the NHL in shots (18). Helping out offensively is certainly one of his responsibilities, but the Coyotes are also seeking improvement on the defensive side of the puck. Tippett hopes by pairing Ekman-Larsson with a steady stalwart like Michalek, who regularly played with Ekman-Larsson the past few years, Ekman-Larsson can maximize his potential all over the ice.\n“He just drags Oliver into the fight a little more, a little more of a defensive mindset,” Tippett said. “I think that will help him greatly at the other end.”\nThe hype surrounding Ekman-Larsson entering this season was probably as high as it's ever been. Not only did he lead the team in goals last season and tie a franchise record for most by a defenseman in a single season with 23, but he’s taken on more of a leadership role as an alternate captain and likely feels pressure to be the heartbeat of the power play in Keith Yandle’s absence.\n“This year at times, I think he’s tried to do too much and then he tries to stay too long on shifts and then ends up doing less,” Tippett said. “Just get him refocused a little here on better defending.”\nLindback’s debut\nBackup goalie Anders Lindback made his first appearance of the season Thursday, performing mop-up duty in a 4-3 loss to the Wild.\nDespite playing more than half a game, Lindback faced only seven shots and made six saves.\nAZCENTRAL\nBoivin: Coyotes wear 'blow up, rebuild' approach well\n“I’ve learned that I have to really bear down in practices and look as them as games and really try hard because it’s hard when you get out there and you haven’t gotten a feel for the game,” Lindback said. “So you kind of have to do what it takes to stay ready.”\nInjury update\nCenter Antoine Vermette was back on the ice for the Coyotes after leaving Thursday’s game with a lower-body injury.\nIn returning to the lineup, Vermette has now appeared in 480 straight games – the second-longest active streak in the NHL.\nWinger Jordan Martinook sat out Saturday’s game. He’s day-to-day with a lower-body injury.\nAs a result, Joe Vitale made his season debut playing on the left side next to center Brad Richardson and captain Shane Doan .\nReach the reporter at sarah.mclellan@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8276.
