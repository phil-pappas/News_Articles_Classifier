Six months prior he made the trip with a busload of Eastern Washington teammates and nearly beat the Washington Huskies in a shootout that featured 111 combined points and was decided by seven.\nAdams threw seven touchdown passes that day at Husky Stadium, a record for a UW opponent.\nWhen he returned in the spring he brought himself, a few footballs and not much else. But he wanted to throw some more passes and, after being barred from EWU practices after announcing his transfer to Oregon, he linked up with Huskies receiver Jaydon Mickens to do it.\nAdams declined an interview request this week to discuss the throw-and-catch session with Mickens. On Thursday afternoon, his new head coach was just as mum as to whether Adams will get a chance Saturday evening to throw some more passes at Husky Stadium, this time for the Oregon Ducks (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12).\n\"I think we have an idea and certainly from a package standpoint, a schematic standpoint, I think we know where we are,\" said Mark Helfrich, asked whether Oregon would use one quarterback against the 3-2 Huskies or hold steady to a rotation including either Jeff Lockie or Taylor Alie . \"We'll keep that internal.\"\nAdams, the starter after fall camp, has looked \"good\" in practices, or about the same as he did in past weeks, Helfrich said.\n\"It's just a gradual progression of confidence,\" he added.\nAdams hasn't played in Oregon's past two games as he rests a broken index finger on his throwing hand, an injury that's affected how hard, far and accurate he can throw.\nOffensive coordinator Scott Frost, speaking on Monday , noted that Oregon's offense would get better once it stuck to one quarterback. UO hasn't had that luxury since Adams was pulled for good Sept. 26 against Utah, after a 2-of-7 start to what became a runaway Utes victory. Lockie earned starts each of the past two games and has completed a combined 21 of 33 passes with two interceptions and touchdowns, and has been sacked four times. Alie had a larger role in a victory against Colorado than he did in a loss to Washington State, but is the better runner of the two, offensive coordinator Scott Frost said. He's completed 4 of 11 passes in the past two games, with a touchdown.\nEach had looked forward to his opportunity, but played unevenly since receiving it. That hasn't necessarily dimmed either's confidence, Helfrich said, even if Adams could return soon and usurp the starting job.\n\"I think that's where (a lack of confidence) kind of shows up is the uncertainty and maybe not being as detailed in your preparation is something that usually shows up when a guy is in that frame of mind,\" Helfrich said, \"and from that standpoint, no, they've been good.\"\nThe Huskies have the Pac-12's best defense against the run and are second-best against the pass. The return of Adams could give Oregon's flagging passing game a boost in a stadium he knows well as a visitor. And, perhaps, he might allow Oregon to continue the trend of poor Pac-12 houseguests: Visiting teams are 14-4 in conference play so far.\n\"That is bizarre, I have no explanation for that,\" Helfrich said. \"I hope it continues this week, I'm all for it right now.\"\nNotes: Redshirt freshman running back Tony Brooks-James has not played two of the past three games due to injury. Taj Griffin and Kani Benoit have taken his carries as a result, with Griffin gaining 220 yards on 22 carries the past two games. Helfrich intimated that Brooks-James could return this week after not playing against Washington State, saying UO has elements of its game plan that include him. \"Royce (Freeman) is obviously the 1-A (option). I think a combination of all those other three in some order of Taj, Kani, Tony and then there are some specific things that each guy has in the plan.\" ... Injured sophomore cornerback Chris Seisay again left practice on a scooter ... The weather forecast calls for rain Saturday at kickoff, but Helfrich said precipitation wouldn't play a role in who plays at quarterback. \"If you get into a big wind situation that might affect some things. We'll wait and see the conditions.\"\n— Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/andrewgreif"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:12:39.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
