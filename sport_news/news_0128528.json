(AP) - Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell is warning people who have filed or may soon file for bankruptcy of a scam in which someone claims to be the consumer's lawyer, the lawyer's partner or a member of their staff.\nThe impostors use software to trick the person's caller ID system so that the call appears to be coming from their bankruptcy lawyer. They then instruct the unwitting consumer to immediately wire money to satisfy a debt.\nSorrell says the calls come late in the evening or during non-business hours so victims can't call their lawyers to confirm the request.\nConsumers who get a call should not wire funds and should contact their lawyer as soon as possible. Sorrell also says people should report any scams to the AG's Consumer Assistance Program.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
