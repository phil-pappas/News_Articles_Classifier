Wacha won 17 games but was 2-3 with a 7.88 ERA in five starts in September, including two losses to the Cubs. \n\"Wacha has the ability to be pretty darned good on the mound himself,\" Arrieta acknowledged. \"I just intend to keep us in the game, regardless of the circumstances, whatever comes up. \n\"But I like my chances to go out there and win us a ballgame.\" \nA victory over the Cardinals would bring the Cubs one victory closer to the NL Championship Series. \nAnd Arrieta is in position to add luster to what already is one of the greatest seasons in franchise history. \n\"Superhuman,\" first baseman Anthony Rizzo said of Arrieta's work. \"Just a good work ethic, a competitor. He expects way more than I've ever seen out of anyone else. \n\"He tries to do better. I don't know how that's possible.\" \nArrieta lost to John Lackey and the Cardinals 5-1 on May 7, but one of Arrieta's few flaws may be a brief loss of memory. \n\"I don't remember anything about it, honestly,\" Arrieta said with a straight face. \nIt was the only loss the Cardinals have handed Arrieta, who is 4-1 lifetime against them with a 4-1 record and 1.63 ERA in nine starts. \nWith Arrieta leading the way, Rizzo didn't knock the suggestion that the Cubs could become baseball's version of \"America's Team.\" \n\"I don't see why not,\" Rizzo said. \"This team has very good character. We're young and have a good time. \n\"Who knows how many times this is going to come around in our lifetime. We're going to enjoy it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:16:48.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
