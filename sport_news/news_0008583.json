The rating system is based on the difficulty of each kick, ­defined by factors such as distance, angle and game situation in which the kick is taken.\nLast year, Foley was ranked 51st of all kickers in the Super Rugby despite guiding the Waratahs to their maiden title — kicking at a percentage of 77.2 but with a rating of 4.68.\nDuring the pool stages of the World Cup, he’s missed just two of 19 attempts and has been awarded a kicker rating of 6.08.\nOnly Wales’ Dan Biggar (15 from 16) and France’s Morgan Parra (6/6) have better ratings of players in quarter-final teams.\nNotably, All Blacks veteran five-eighth Dan Carter is no longer knocking them over with laser-like precision — and is ranked ninth of the remaining kickers, with a rating of 5.43 after missing four of 20 attempts so far.\nHaving watched Foley kick them to victories in consecutive weeks, his Wallabies teammates have complete faith in their No 10.\n“I watch him train. I watch how much work the kickers do on the park to get to that position,” vice-captain Michael Hooper said.\n“It is no fluke they are out there kicking goals and kicking well. It is a lot of hard work.\n“They are the last guys out on the field often, so it’s good they get that praise and they deserve it because it’s a job that’s very difficult.”\nAAP\nRWC fixtures (Frame content direct link: https://dl54hz68b4x92.cloudfront.net/wknOc/4/ .)", "external_links": ["https://dl54hz68b4x92.cloudfront.net/wknOc/4/"], "published": "2015-10-15T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:38:33.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
