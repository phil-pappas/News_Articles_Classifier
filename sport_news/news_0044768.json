RB Dom Bragalone (79 carries, 362 yds, 4.6 avg, TD); So. WR Troy Pelletier (43 rec., 435 yds, 4 TD); Jr. WR Trevor Socarras (31 rec., 285 yds); Sr. Derek Knott (22 rec., 221 yds); Jr. LB Colton Caslow (58 TT, 3 TFL, 1 sack, 1 PBU); Sr. Noah Robb (41 TT, 3 TFL, 2 sacks, 1 PBU). \nFordham leaders: Jr. QB Kevin Anderson 118-254, 1,797 yds, 17 TD, 5 INT); So. Chase Edmonds (156 carries, 1,046 yds, 16.7 ypc, 5 TD; Jr. Robbie Cantelli (29 rec.,443 yds, TD); Sr. LB Stephen Hodge (69 TT, 2.5 sacks, 2 FF); So. Niko Thorpe (51 TT, 5.0 sacks, 9 TFL, 2 FF); Sr. DB JQ Bowers (3 INT). \nThe skinny: After a bye week, the Mountain Hawks get back into league play and back on the road to face the defending league champs and the No. 10 ranked team in the country. The bye week allowed Lehigh to get somewhat healthier, although DB Brian Githens, who is No. 3 on the team in tackles and has two of the team's three INTs, is expected to be out for most of the rest of the season battling mono. Fordham is a tough challenge, especially for a Lehigh defense that has been vulnerable against high-powered offenses. The Mountain Hawks must limit Chase Edmonds' big runs and also get a few turnovers, something that hasn't happened often enough. Likewise, Lehigh can't turn it over on offense. An upset could set up Lehigh for an exciting final month of the season and throw the Patriot League title picture out of focus. However, until proven otherwise, Fordham remains a cut above the pack. \nKeith Groller 's prediction: Fordham 38-24. \n\nLAFAYETTE (1-6, 0-2) AT HOLY CROSS (2-4, 0-2) \nWhen : 1:05 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 24, Fitton Field, Worcest7er, Mass. \nSeries : Leopards lead 16-13. Last meeting: Crusaders 24-14 ('14). \nTV: RCN-4, WBPH-60 \nLafayette leaders: DeSean Brown, 63 car, 213 yds, 1 TD; Drew Reed, 123-191-3, 1,203 yds, 6 TDs; Matt Mrazek, 41 rec, 474 yds, 2 TDs; Rocco Palumbo, 33 rec, 281 yds,; Brandon Bryant, 81 tackles (5.5 TFL); Mark Dodd, 47 tackles (5 TFL). \nHoly Cross leaders: Diquan Walker, 54 car, 215 yds, 4 TDs; Peter Pujals, 148-254-7, 1,640 yds, 13 TDs; Brendan Flaherty, 56 rec, 506 yds, 6 TDs; Kalif Raymond, 30 rec, 402 yds, 2 TDs; Nick McBeath, 59 tackles (4 TFL). \nThe skinny: Crusaders hard to figure offensively. Pujals was 35-for-70 passing for 508 yards and four TDs last week but can hurt Leopards running. Last year, he threw only 15 passes but ran for 115 yards on 26 carries. RB Gabe Guild has only 182 yards rushing this year but had 142 vs. Leopards in 2013. 'Saders took Fordham to OT last week, could easily be 5-1. Leopards' ground game has been woeful all season, worst in FCS at 44.7 ypg, thus allowing opponents to tee off on QB Drew Reed, who has been sacked 25 times. Injuries have been the difference-maker for Leopards, especially on offensive line and defensive secondary. Leopards must improve on third downs and in the red zone. Reed needs a huge game. \nPaul Reinhard's pick: Holy Cross 38-17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:39:53.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
