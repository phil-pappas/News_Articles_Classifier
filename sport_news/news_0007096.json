So their final Rock Valley Conference North Division game at Whitewater would again be a challenge. \nBehind the senior hitters Micah Kramer and Mikaela Grant, the Eagles earned a healthy 3-0 RVC North win on the Whippets’ home court. \n“We have not been 100 percent all season, so it is what it is,” Jefferson coach Greg Fairfield said. “We got to battle tonight and they came out strong and played solid. Whitewater is just like us.” \nThe Eagles won by scores of 25-17, 25-14 and 25-16 to earn the season sweep over the Whippets. \nComing into Thursday’s matchup, both teams were coming off games against RVC North leader East Troy. As Fairfield said, no team has an easy game against the state-ranked Trojans. \nThe previous match against these two teams ended with the same result and started similarly too. \nJefferson jumped out to an early edge with a 25-17 decision in Game 1. \nThe Eagles continued with a more decisive victory in Game 2, despite Whitewater’s Myriama Smith-Traore putting up block after block. Jefferson only trailed initially at 1-0, and then did not give up the lead for the remainder of the game. \nGame 2 was highlighted by Jefferson’s ability to serve deep into the court but with pace as well. Senior Emily Finger was able to match her teammate’s fast serves with her off-speed short balls. \n“She has a pretty nasty float serve and the way the fans were swirling in here tonight that thing was moving very, very good,” Fairfield said. “It is a hard serve to pass.” \nFairfield went as far as admitting that he himself does not even like returning Finger’s serves in drills during practice and Whitewater’s backline seemed to share his thoughts as they had a difficult time all night. \nWhitewater’s biggest threat all game was in Smith-Traore, who showed off her ability in Game 3 by leading the Whippet roster, which only features two seniors. \n“Against (Smith-Traore) you can only try and get hands in her face,” Fairfield said. “If she wants to go around the blocks she can. It is just a matter of trying to get digs around and behind the block to get the best of her.” \nAlong with Smith-Traore, Kate and Anna Riemer were able to keep the Whippets in Game 3, with their service game mounting a five-point comeback to take the lead, 13-12. \n“Our serving is tough and what keeps us in it,” Whitewater head coach Kathy Bullis said. “I try to let them take charge because I tell them the same things over and over again. I want to let them identify where they can improve because it will take them to the next level.” \nAt 14-14 and after a Whitewater timeout where Bullis let her team talk without hardly input from the coaching staff, the game saw its longest rally of the night. Jefferson finished the rally on quick one-ball that was buried too low for any Whitewater player to get a hand on it. \nAfter a Smith-Traore serve went into the net in the next Whippet service opportunity, the momentum and game went to Jefferson. \nGrant and junior outside hitter Tierney Hall combined for 11 kills to lead the Eagles, who also got 20 assists from Finger and 17 digs from senior libero Andrea Kubicek. \nGrant added three aces, while junior middle blocker Marissa Albrecht had a team-high three blocks. \nBoth teams will look to make a run in the conference tournament on Oct. 17 in Edgerton. With the injuries Fairfield’s team has faced this season, chemistry is the name of the game for the Eagles. \n“We are looking to find our groove going into the tournament and regionals,” Fairfield said. “We want to find a way to win.” \nBullis had a little different message for her young Whippet squad. \n“The bottom line is communication,” Bullis said. “They are doing a good job calling out how many hitters, but now we need to be verbalizing more. Another thing is confidence. Our young team has confidence in peaks and valleys.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:23:18.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
