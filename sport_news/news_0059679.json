This was a rematch of a 2011 fight between the pair, which went the distance and was won by Bracero with a unanimous decision.\nHe didn't have time for all that this time around, as Bracero caught O'Connor with a brutal right hand that sent him crumbling to the canvas.\nIt was evidently a scary scene of sorts, with O'Connor remaining down for several minutes and needing the attention of physicians while he was still in the ring. He eventually got up and was seen communicating with his trainer and Bracero, who obviously wanted to make sure that no permanent damage was done.\nO'Connor has a record of 26-3 with 10 knockouts, but after being on the wrong end of what many are calling the knockout of the year, it may be a little while before he steps in the ring once again. Bracero, meanwhile, recorded just the fifth knockout of his career, in what was his first non-decision victory in the last three years.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com\n[ via Uproxx ]", "external_links": ["http://uproxx.com/sports/2015/10/knockout-of-the-year-video/"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:23:23.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
