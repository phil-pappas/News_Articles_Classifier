Ted Cruz is galvanizing conservatives aligned with the Tea Party, and Marco Rubio is getting a second look as the two U.S. senators blast the establishment.\n\"We get tired of candidates standing up, professing what they think we want to hear, and then they get (to Washington) and it goes back to the old boys' club and nothing changes,\" said Myron Spanier, a prominent Republican in Arapahoe County.\nThe political climate — extrapolated from interviews with more than two dozen conservative activists and leaders ahead of Wednesday's GOP debate in Boulder — showcases Colorado as a microcosm of the national picture and foreshadows the future direction of the peripatetic 2016 presidential race.\nColorado essentially cut itself from the Republican primary picture earlier this year when the state party abandoned its presidential preference poll , but the debate puts the state's voters in the spotlight well before the general election, when this swing state may determine the winner of the White House.\nAdvertisement The Republican faithful are looking to the back-to-back debates on CNBC to help narrow the field — eager to see the contest move to the next phase even as they remain unsettled on which candidate is the best choice.\n\"I'm to the point where I'm looking for someone to really step up,\" said Larry Kramer, a 59-year-old retiree who leads a GOP group in Jefferson County, the state's political center . \"I want to start seeing some concrete things. ... We need something that's going to stick to the wall now.\"\nBefore the state party canceled the caucus presidential poll, the top candidates made a point to visit Colorado, even though it didn't sit at the front of the political calendar. Seven candidates appealed to social conservatives and activists at the Western Conservative Summit in June, where Carson and Fiorina won good reviews .\nThe state's conservative voters represent all factions of the Republican Party and bucked the trend in the 2012 caucus , giving Rick Santorum the win. And this year, there's no consensus behind a front-runner.\n\"You don't see it just in Colorado, you see it throughout the Rocky Mountain West,\" said Frank McNulty, a Jeb Bush supporter and former state House speaker. \"Regardless of what your partisan politics are, there is still an independent streak. People ... don't like to be told what to do or who to support.\"\nEven as the state's GOP voters winnow their list of contenders, the indecision reflects an internal tug-of-war between which candidates are most electable and which best represent the party's ideology.\nGOP activists feel burned by the 2008 and 2012 elections, and know the stakes are high with Hillary Clinton as the probable Democratic nominee.\n\"There's a lot of fascination with the three nonelected candidates: Trump, Carson and Fiorina,\" said Dick Wadhams, a veteran Republican strategist and former state party leader. \"I think it's clear that those three candidates have a lot of interest here in Colorado, and whether that will sustain itself, I don't know.\"\nTrump, the party's front-runner, is creating divisions among Republican voters — even in the same household. Joan and Jim Parker, a retired couple from Aurora, realized at a recent Republican breakfast meeting in Englewood that they are split on their top candidates.\nFor her, it's Carson. \"He just seems so much more logical on things than other people are,\" she said.\nFor him, it's Trump. \"I think he will stand up, take names, kick butt and get something done,\" he said, surprising his wife with his choice. \"We have a Republican Congress that cannot stand up. And I'm just tired of it.\"\n\"I think he should drop out,\" said Joan Parker of her husband's pick. \"Sorry, but I can't get excited about Donald Trump. He's too much of an egotist.\"\nJim Parker conceded a fear about Trump. \"I am worried he may or may not be a Republican,\" he said with a laugh.\nThe activists supporting Trump credit him for raising important issues that others are too afraid to emphasize, such as immigration, and suggest that he is the only candidate not beholden to special interests because he can self-fund much of his campaign.\nThe number of people who initially considered him unelectable \"is narrowing,\" said Kramer, who lives near Littleton. \"People are starting to say it looks like he could be the guy.\"\nOther conservatives — particularly those aligned with the Tea Party — remain skeptical.\n\"Many people who support him are running on emotion, they are running on their anger,\" said the Colorado Tea Party Patriots' Regina Thomson. \"They are not running on the reality of how he can govern and how he can actually accomplish many of the things he says that he wants to.\"\nAmong her members, the attention is focused on the U.S. senator from Texas.\n\"Ted Cruz, down the line, is by far the most constitutionally consistent, not only in his past behavior, but also in what he says he would do as president,\" said Thomson, who called him \"by and large, the front-runner as far as grassroots members are concerned.\"\nIn the debate, Republican voters repeatedly said they are looking for more substance from the candidates, not just a vision for how they would govern.\nLee Ormiston, a 70-year-old Republican voter in Aurora, said he wants to see more focus on the national debt.\n\"We cannot deficit-spend for very long,\" he said. \"You and I both know there's a limit to how much we can put on our plastic.\"\nRick Murray, who organizes a weekly Republican meeting in Highlands Ranch, said he is looking for a leader to emerge.\n\"Some people I like, some I think are stupid and they ought to get out of politics,\" he said. \"I haven't really seen anybody that's offered anything new yet — a really definitive plan that can get this country back on track.\"\nJohn Frank: 303-954-2409, jfrank@denverpost.com or @ByJohnFrank\nAbout the GOP debate\nThe third Republican presidential debate is set for 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Coors Events Center on the University of Colorado campus.
