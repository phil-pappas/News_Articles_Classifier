But with Luka Modric back in the starting lineup after recovering from injury, Real went ahead in the eighth minute when Lucas Vázquez squared for Ronaldo to finish past Sergio Álvarez in the home goal. \nDanilo doubled Madrid’s lead 15 minutes later when he found space on the right and had time to pick his spot. \nNavas, who has only conceded three goals in Spain’s top flight this term, was on scintillating form in the first half and his saves from efforts by Fabián Orellana, Iago Aspas and Pablo Hernández were out of the top draw. \nCelta, who thumped Barcelona at the Balaídos 4-1 last month, battled hard to get back into the game after the break, but their hopes were dealt a blow in the 57th minute when the centre back Gustavo Cabral protested a decision too energetically and was shown a second yellow card, earning a dismissal. \nReal failed to make their numerical superiority count, however, and Marcelo had to clear a Nolito effort off the line in the 72nd minute before the Spain winger pulled a goal back with a stunning drive into the top corner five minutes from time. \nThe Celta substitute John Guidetti fired narrowly wide moments later but Real held firm and Marcelo scored with the last kick of the match in the 96th minute to make it 3-1. \nReal have 21 points from nine matches, while Celta are level with the champions Barcelona on 18. Barcelona play their game in hand at home to Eibar on Sunday. \nAtletico Madrid are fourth on 16 points going into Sunday’s match at home to Valencia. Villarreal, who also have 16 points and are fifth in the league table, play at promoted Las Palmas. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
