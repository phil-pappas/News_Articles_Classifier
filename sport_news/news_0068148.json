Photograph by: Matt Slocum , AP \nREGINA — Robservations ... \nThe Saskatchewan Roughriders gave Kevin Glenn, who was traded to the Montreal Alouettes on Wednesday, a lovely parting gift. Glenn gets to play against the sieve-like Saskatchewan defence Nov. 8 at Percival Molson Stadium. Every quarterback should be so lucky. \nI will miss dealing with Glenn on a regular basis. He was the epitome of class during his second stint with Saskatchewan. Even on Wednesday, when his bye week was suddenly disrupted by a trade and life became instantly crazy, he took the time to return a telephone message from a rumpled scribe while checking into his hotel in Montreal. \nIt was shocking on Friday to see an offensive powerhouse such as the Toronto Blue Jays fail to score a run against the Kansas City Royals in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series. Moreover, the visiting Blue Jays eked out a mere three hits en route to losing 5-0. Surely, that has to be an aberration for a team as formidable as Toronto. \nThere isn’t any need to panic over an opening-game loss. Keep in mind that Toronto lost the first two games of its previous series before winning three in a row and eliminating the Texas Rangers. Conversely, the Blue Jays had 2-0 and 3-1 series leads over Kansas City in the 1985 ALCS and still lost in seven games. In other words, a hot start doesn’t necessarily foreshadow the outcome of a series. \nSo, which genius allowed beer to still be served in cans — i.e. projectiles — at Blue Jays home games? \nOn Oct. 9, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats’ Luke Tasker caught a touchdown pass, threw a pass, and also held the ball for placement attempts during a home game against Saskatchewan. Does that make him a multi-Tasker? \nDuring that game, won 30-15 by the Tiger-Cats, Riders defensive end John Chick approached every play as though it would determine a Grey Cup champion. Every football player, at every level, should take note of Chick’s non-stop motor. \nA year ago in this cherished space, it was written that the Roughriders should attempt to acquire quarterback Henry Burris from the Ottawa Redblacks. There was an immediate outcry from readers who opined that Burris was over the hill. Now, at 40, Smilin’ Hank is the best candidate for the Canadian Football League’s most-outstanding-player award. His detractors are suddenly disarmed. \nKudos to Steve Mazurak — the Riders’ vice-president, sales and partnerships — for working the gate at Regina Intercollegiate Football League games. Mazurak is a proud member of the Wascana Kiwanis Club, which has been the RIFL’s benefactor since 1954. When asked why he volunteers his time, Mazurak — a Sheldon-Williams Spartans alumnus — replied: “Because someone did it for me when I played high school football.” Talk about giving back. \nLuther Lions tailback Carter Hewson provides highlight-reel material virtually every time he carries the football. A Grade 11 student, the elusive Hewson specializes in leaving would-be tacklers grasping at air. \nWhy do hockey referees typically look the other way when, during a battle for the puck in the corner, a player repeatedly cross-checks an opponent in the back? \nThree-on-three hockey in overtime is outstanding. Four-on-four play in regulation time would be even better. \nThere is a local flavour to the Boston College football team. The roster includes Jake Burt, a freshman tight end who was born in Regina in 1996. The Burt family moved to Boston in 2000. \nNice people who deserve a plug: Alan Ford, Jaxon Ford, Sally Ford, Nolan Tonge, Brock Sich, Bryce Sich, Wally Sich, Rob Palmarin, Steve Mazurak, Krista Smith, Lloyd Osten, Jason Janssen, Kevin Glenn, Jayden Lorenz, Joel Gasson, Bonnie Skinner, Vera Baguley, Finley Easton, Michael Scraper, Tristan Oremba, Wascana Kiwanis football volunteers, and the all-star human beings who so cheerfully work at the concession during RIFL games. \nrvanstone@leaderpost.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:40:29.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
