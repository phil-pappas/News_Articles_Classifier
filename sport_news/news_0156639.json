Matt Marton, AP Fullscreen 1. Ohio State (5-0, 1-0) – It wasn’t anything outstanding, but it’s hard to discount a road victory in conference and that’s what the Buckeyes got when they held off the Hoosiers. RB Ezekiel Elliott was outstanding, running for 274 yards and three TDs as Ohio State maintains the top spot. Last week: 1.  Andy Lyons, Getty Images Fullscreen 2. Michigan State (5-0, 1-0) – The Spartans haven’t put together a complete game and had to hang on late to beat Purdue at home. It was the latest uninspiring victory, but it was a win. A trip to Rutgers this week offers another challenge against a lesser team before visiting Michigan in two weeks. Last week: 2.  Dale G. Young, Detroit News Fullscreen 3. Northwestern (5-0, 1-0) – The Wildcats defense continues to be outstanding, completing a shutout over Minnesota while allowing just seven points a game this season. The offense hasn’t been quite as good, but it’s showing steady improvement behind quarterback Clayton Thorson and running back Justin Jackson. Last week: 3.  Matt Marton, AP Fullscreen 4. Iowa (5-0, 1-0) – The Hawkeyes continued their impressive start with a win at Wisconsin, their first victory in that series since 2009. The offense has been solid this season, but was stymied against the Badgers. However, the defense did its job to preserve the victory. Last week: 4.  Morry Gash, AP Fullscreen 5. Michigan (4-1, 1-0) – The story for the Wolverines has been an outstanding defense that pitched its second straight shutout, the first time they’ve done that since 2000. They had three interceptions against Maryland and limited the Terps to just 105 total yards. The ante goes up next week in a battle with Northwestern. Last week: 5.  David Guralnick, Detroit News Fullscreen 6. Penn State (4-1, 1-0) – The Nittany Lions aren’t exactly riding high with confidence these days, but they came up with a win over Army and its triple-option offense. The offense is still having trouble getting untracked as Indiana comes to town next before a trip to Ohio State. Last week: 9.  Gene J. Puskar, AP Fullscreen 7. Wisconsin (3-2, 0-1) – It’s been a long time since running the ball was an issue for the Badgers, but after gaining just 86 yards against Iowa there has to be growing concern, especially with the continued inconsistent play of QB Joel Stave. To top it off, the Badgers face a brutal schedule over the next five weeks. Last week: 6.  Morry Gash, AP Fullscreen 8. Illinois (4-1, 1-0) – The Illini are riding high after rallying to beat Nebraska. Running back Josh Ferguson was knocked out of the game early but QB Wes Lunt rallied them in the fourth quarter. Next week’s trip to Iowa will be a chance for the Illini to prove they belong. Last week: 11.  Bradley Leeb, AP Fullscreen 9. Nebraska (2-3, 0-1) – It’s hard not to feel bad for the Cornhuskers considering all three of their losses have been heartbreakers. But entering the fourth quarter with a 13-point lead and giving up the winning score in the final seconds means next week’s meeting with Wisconsin might not be as big as most thought it would be. Last week: 8.  Bradley Leeb, AP Fullscreen 10. Minnesota (3-2, 0-1) – The offensive woes just keep rolling for the Gophers, who were shut out at Northwestern. They managed only 173 total yards with 99 coming through the air as both Mitch Leidner and Demry Croft struggled. Next week’s trip to Purdue won’t be easy for a team that can’t put points on the board. Last week: 7.  Matt Marton, AP Fullscreen 11. Indiana (4-1, 0-1) – The Hoosiers were game, coming just yards away from tying the game on the final play against Ohio State. As exciting as it was, the defense just couldn’t avoid the big play as Ezekiel Elliott torched the Hoosiers. Still, it appears Kevin Wilson has his team on the upswing. Last week: 10.  Andy Lyons, Getty Images Fullscreen 12. Purdue (1-4, 0-1) – If you can look good in defeat, the Boilermakers did so in falling to Michigan State. They had the ball down three in the fourth quarter but couldn’t get the big play they needed. However, playmakers are emerging with QB David Blough and RB Markell Jones. Last week: 14.  Dale G. Young, Detroit News Fullscreen 13. Rutgers (2-2, 0-1) – The best thing that happened this week for the Scarlet Knights is that they didn’t play. They’ll be welcomed back this week by a Michigan State team that isn’t exactly in a good mood after dropping in the polls despite remaining unbeaten on the season. Last week: 12.  Alex Goodlett, Getty Images Fullscreen 14. Maryland (2-3, 0-1) – The Terps are a mess on the field and the shutout loss at home to Michigan didn’t help matters. QB Caleb Rowe was 8-for-27 for 47 yards and three interceptions before he was pulled, while Daxx Garman wasn’t any better, going 2-for-9. There’s no light at the end of the tunnel either as Maryland travels to Ohio State next. Last week: 13.  Rob Carr, Getty Images Fullscreen Like this topic?

(Photo: Morry Gash, Associated Press) \nOften time, perception is far from reality.\nIn the world of college football, that seems to be especially true. A look around the nation this weekend offered a convincing glimpse.\nAlabama, thought to be a crumbling empire two weeks ago, walked into Georgia and destroyed the Bulldogs. And Ole Miss, the team that handed Alabama its crushing loss, went to The Swamp and got manhandled by a Florida team no one expected to be 5-0. Only that's exactly where the Gators are now.\nOther teams believed to be elite have many wondering today.\nThat idea has been magnified in the Big Ten.\nThe perception was Ohio State and Michigan State were the best. After each had lackluster victories Saturday, there is now some doubt.\nThe Buckeyes and Spartans are still the teams to beat, but the chance of actually beating them looks much more possible today. And over in the West it was Wisconsin, Nebraska and Minnesota expected to fight for a spot in Indianapolis in the conference championship game.\nNot so much anymore.\nNorthwestern and Iowa are unbeaten while Michigan appears to be getting better each week.\nAll three are shattering perceptions, and Northwestern and Iowa are at the forefront.\nThe Wildcats' defense was outstanding again, shutting out Minnesota, a team many expected to contend in the West but looks more like a pretender. The Hawkeyes, meanwhile, went on the road and beat a Wisconsin team that has been part of the Big Ten championship race for years.\nNorthwestern served notice early this season with a victory over Stanford in week one and followed it a couple weeks later with a win at Duke. The win over Minnesota was as complete as the Wildcats have had. They held the Gophers to 173 total yards while quarterback Clayton Thorson ran for a pair of touchdowns and Justin Jackson gained 120 yards on the ground.\n\"A pretty darn good performance in all three phases today,\" Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said. \"Explosive play on the punt return, took care of the ball offensively — no turnovers. Then to see the way that our defense was able to pretty much make them one-dimensional and stop the run.\n\"I thought it was a pretty solid performance across the board.\"\nIowa's performance wasn't as complete but it was no less impressive. The Hawkeyes weren't humming along offensively but they stymied the Badgers, holding them to just 86 yards rushing. And it was the first time Iowa has beaten Wisconsin since 2009, claiming the Heartland Trophy.\n\"We're sending a message to the Big Ten,\" said cornerback Desmond King, who added two more interceptions to raise his season total to five. \"We want to let them know the bullies of the Big Ten are back. That's what Iowa was known for back then. We're just trying to bring that back.\"\nThat's big talk from a team not expected to make much noise this season.\nOf course, that was the perception.\nReality is proving the big talk might be on the money.\nWisconsin struggling \nAnother reality surfacing from Saturday was the fact first-year coach Paul Chryst has a lot of work to do at Wisconsin.\nThe Badgers have been rather ordinary following a season-opening loss to Alabama. After plodding through three victories against overmatched opponents, an offense without a running game – something that has been Wisconsin's staple – came up flat in the loss to Iowa.\nThe Badgers had chances to win – a fumble on fourth down from inside the 5 in the fourth quarter was huge – but the firepower is absent.\nQuarterback Joel Stave continues to struggle, throwing two interceptions and losing two fumbles, while running back Corey Clement is out after hernia surgery.\nNeedless to say, frustration is mounting in Madison. However, that doesn't mean the Badgers are throwing in the towel.\n\"Coach Chryst speaks to us after the games,\" safety Michael Caputo told the Wisconsin State Journal. \"I think what he said really hit home. He just said 'This is what adversity feels like. This one hurts, but you've got to bounce back because it's a long road. It's a marathon, and we've just got to keep on rolling after this one.'\"\nIllinois making noise \nGotta give some props to interim coach Bill Cubit and his work at Illinois. He didn't exactly inherit the greatest position when head coach Tim Beckman was fired days before the season started.\nBut the offensive coordinator and former Western Michigan coach has done as well as expected. And Saturday's last-minute victory over Nebraska was evidence the Illini are not going to fold this season.\n\"I'm not stunned because of the type of kids we've got,\" Cubit said. \"But boy, I'm sure proud of those kids.\"\nQuarterback Wes Lunt hit receiver Geronimo Allison in the corner of the end zone with 10 seconds left, the fourth straight play they tried to connect. It capped off a furious rally as the Illini trailed 13-0 in the fourth quarter and had numerous missed opportunities.\nThere's no telling where this leads, but at 4-1 overall and 1-0 in the conference, the Illini are sky high heading into next week's game at Iowa.\n\"We all, as players, want to put this place back on the map,\" Lunt said. \"That's been a goal of mine since Day 1. This was just an awesome experience.\"\nmcharboneau@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/mattcharboneau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:13:40.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
