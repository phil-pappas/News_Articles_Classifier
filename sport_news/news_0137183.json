His 12-year-old son was in the car at the time.\nAs part of the judge’s decision, Sydor received a mandatory 15-day jail sentence. Including time served, Sydor will serve two long weekends at the Anoka County workhouse beginning Friday, said Ryan Pacyga, Sydor’s attorney.\nThe balance of the 60 days will be staggered in 15-day intervals the next three Octobers. However, if Sydor can establish that he has maintained sobriety each year that he reports, the judge can waive the next 15-day executed jail term.\nIf Sydor violates the terms of his probation, he can be put in jail for those remaining 305 days with credit for time served. Darryl Sydor:  Wild assistant coach could have his jail time reduced to 15 days. The team will address his status later.\n“I apologize to my family, friends, the Minnesota Wild and the fans,” Sydor said in a statement. “I am deeply saddened and humbled by my actions. Recovery is giving me the opportunity to redeem myself to all I have hurt. The support I have received has been overwhelming and I couldn’t be more thankful. The entire Minnesota Wild organization has stood by me and supported my family through this very difficult time. I can’t thank them enough for that. I am putting recovery first for myself and my family, and with that, everything else will fall into place.”\nAs part of his probation, Sydor must provide proof of satisfactory completion of treatment, cannot drink alcohol, use drugs unless prescribed by a doctor, can have no alcohol or drug-related offenses, must attend a MADD Impact panel and submit to random testing on demand by his probation officer at his expense.\nSydor also was fined $900 and will pay $113 in court costs.\nSydor, 43, played 1,291 NHL regular-season games and won two Stanley Cups.\n“I’m happy that Darryl received a sentence that reflects the good work that he’s done because while he’s responsible for his conduct in this case, he’s got a long history of good service to the community and being a good father,” Pacyga said. “This should not define who he is. He’s being given a chance at recovery, and he’s making the most of it.”\nIn a statement, the Wild said, “The Minnesota Wild is aware of the plea agreement reached today by Assistant Coach Darryl Sydor and respects the decision made by the Anoka County District Court. The team will continue to support Darryl, and his family, as he continues with his recovery. His return to the organization will be addressed at a later date.”", "external_links": ["http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14446997604630.jpg?w=263"], "published": "2015-10-13T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:52:52.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
