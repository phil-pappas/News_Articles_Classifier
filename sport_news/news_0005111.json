Dozier is the first McDonald’s All-American in over a decade to sign with South Carolina. (David Caraviello/Staff) × COLUMBIA — He may not have been a McDonald’s All-American, but as a top-40 national recruit out of Oak Hill Academy, Sindarius Thornwell is as qualified as anyone in South Carolina’s locker room to give P.J. Dozier advice. “The biggest thing is to try to stay away from social media, and everybody’s opinion on what he needs to do and what needs to be done,” said the junior guard. “Try to keep him focused on just playing his game and going out and doing the things we need him to do, instead of the things everybody else wants him to do. Just stay focused.” Dozier, the first McDonald’s All-American to sign with South Carolina since Rolando Howell in 2000, joins a team coming off USC’s first winning season in six years. The Gamecocks opened practice last week for a campaign which begins Nov. 14 against Norfolk State, and is the most anticipated of head coach Frank Martin’s tenure at the school. “I’m always excited to start the season, but I can honestly say, this season I’ve been the most excited and anxious to play,” said junior guard Duane Notice. “The group of guys we have collectively, I think everybody’s buying in mentally and physically.” After practicing last season with as few as seven players due to injuries and suspensions, the Gamecocks at last have some depth. After struggling last year with tendinitis in his knees, Thornwell appears back to full health. And then there’s a Dozier, the son and nephew of former USC players who was a star at Columbia’s Spring Valley High School. The 6-6 Dozier — who, like all USC newcomers, cannot speak to reporters until after his first semester — has played point guard in practice 90 percent of the time, Martin said. And he has Thornwell to help him manage expectations and block out distractions. “When P.J. goes through a moment where he doesn’t have a good practice or a good game, and the 5,000 people who claim to be his friends on (social media) start saying, ‘You’re not as good as they say you are,’ and all that nonsense – the guy in the locker next to him can say, ‘You’re all right, man. You’re all right. Don’t pay attention to that stuff,’” Martin said. Rated the No. 19 prospect nationally last year by ESPN, Dozier “has a high IQ,” Notice said, and his size can create matchup problems for defenders. “P.J. has come into college with a great mindset,” Notice added, “and I’m proud of him and ready to see what he can do this year.” USC is now without former walk-on forward Brian Steele, who due to continuing knee problems has given up playing and become a student assistant. But after losing just one starter from last year’s squad, there are now expectations for the Gamecocks — and their star freshman. “When you’re a good player, you kind of learn how to manage those realities,” Martin said. “It’s my job to try and help him through those things.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:54:51.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
