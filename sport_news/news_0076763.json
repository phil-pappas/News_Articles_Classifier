Make those jokes about the T-shirts, about errant Cy Young predictions and about too-soon contract extensions now, for one last time. If the Red Sox have their way, you will need new material come next spring to poke holes in the team's philosophy. Because Boston wants an ace. President of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski didn’t pound his fist on the table, and he didn’t pull a Woody Johnson and openly pine for a player currently the property of another team. But Dombrowski wants an ace every bit as much as Ralphie wanted a Red Ryder BB gun — and he'd probably shoot his eye out to get one. Dombrowski sees a roster that, despite a second consecutive last-place finish, doesn’t have that many areas requiring an upgrade. Sure, there's a major conundrum with Hanley Ramirez and first base, and right now the bullpen plan consists of a few guys who didn’t pitch down the stretch. But the quickest, the simplest and yes, the most expensive improvement the team can make is with a No. 1 starter. \"First and foremost, we've talked about trying to improve our pitching staff — starters and our bullpen,\" Dombrowski said during a news conference Tuesday that wrapped up the season and officially commenced the offseason for Boston. \"That will be a primary focus.\" Boston's brass spent the majority of last winter declaring a No. 1 starter more luxury than necessity. The motivation for that stance can be debated — whether the Red Sox didn’t land an ace because they didn’t view it as necessary, or the Red Sox deemed an ace unnecessary because they didn’t land one. That Boston failed in 2015 reflects more poorly on the execution of their plan than the plan itself. The Royals, Blue Jays and Rangers all got to July before making a move to bring an ace aboard — likely the same strategy Ben Cherington had in mind at season's start. The Sox and their new man in charge won't take that same approach this winter. There's an added urgency after another last-place finish. The starting pitching market is flush with big-name options. Boston has a plethora of options for its rotation. Clay Buchholz, Rick Porcello, Wade Miley, Eduardo Rodriguez, Joe Kelly and Henry Owens all acquitted themselves well for at least a portion of the season. Brian Johnson lingers as depth in Triple A. If the season started tomorrow, the Sox would be able to cover the requisite innings, or as Dombrowski put it Tuesday, \"I don't think the back end of our rotation is going to be the difficult part.\" Trading for Miley made a lot of sense last winter: Boston needed some reliable innings. Trading away Miley makes almost as much sense this winter: Boston doesn’t need the quantity as much as a higher level of quality. \"In our situation, when you’ve got Buchholz back and feeling good and you go from there, our depth in starting pitching is pretty good,\" Dombrowski said. \"I don't think it's the depth as much as you're looking for that one guy who could be your horse if you can get him.\" Those internal options for the rotation don’t include a bona fide No. 1. But the free agent market holds plenty of horses, headlined by Toronto's David Price and the Dodgers' Zack Greinke — provided the latter opts out of his current deal, as expected. Kansas City's Johnny Cueto and Washington's Jordan Zimmermann also would immediately vault to the top of the Boston rotation were they to sign with the Red Sox. Oakland's Sonny Gray and Cleveland's Carlos Carrasco might be on the trade market. Dombrowski said he expects Boston's payroll to be in the same ballpark as it was last season, when it exceeded the luxury tax and pushed up against $200 million. Mike Napoli and Shane Victorino are off the books for next season, removing $29 million from the payroll — a bit more than salary increases for Ramirez, Porcello and Allen Craig eat up. That should leave Dombrowski enough room to make overtures to the high end of the pitching market, even if the team can't find a landing spot for Ramirez this winter. An ace remains the most obvious place for a significant upgrade. In 2015, Boston missed not only the production of a typical No. 1 starter, but also the leadership. \"We have a lot of guys in position to do those things, but (to have a guy that shows the way) can always help — from a makeup standpoint, an experience standpoint and to be ready for a long season,\" general manager Mike Hazen said. T-shirts with \"He's the ace\" emblazoned on them? The Red Sox only want to print one of those next spring.
