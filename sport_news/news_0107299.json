It also eliminates the need to constantly hold the weapon and it prevents the weapon from falling or being dropped. As a result, it enhances safety and it reduces the risk of accidental discharge. The invention features a convenient and portable design that is ideal for use by hunters. Additionally, the GUN REST HOLDER is producible in design variations and a prototype is available.\nThe inventors described the invention design. “Our design provides a safer, more convenient way to secure the placement of a rifle or shotgun.”\nThe original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
