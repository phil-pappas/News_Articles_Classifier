Posted: Sunday, October 4, 2015 6:24 pm Kansas soccer's offense explodes for four goals against Iowa State in 4-0 win Skylar Rolstad | @SkyRolSports kansan.com \nKansas soccer rebounded from a Big 12 opener loss with an emphatic 4-0 win over Iowa State on Sunday afternoon. Freshman midfielder Grace Hagan scored for the second week in a row, while senior midfielder Liana Salazar added her fourth goal of the season. Salazar also registered two assists. Salazar’s first assist opened scoring. She found freshman midfielder Parker Roberts making a run into the box in the 28th minute. Roberts finished into the right side of the goal for her second on the season. Salazar then assisted the first goal of junior midfielder Jackie Georgoulis’s career from a corner kick in the 30th minute. Hagan scored at the back post from a pass from senior forward Ashley Williams in the 56th minute before Salazar capped off the afternoon with a goal of her own from a free kick from 20 yards away. \"I thought we played really well today,\" coach Mark Francis said in the team’s news release. \"The thing I was more pleased about though was that, we not only played well, but we converted our chances, which we haven't necessarily been doing recently.” “We had a lot of people score today which is something that is really encouraging,\" he added. \"Today was a good result for us. We really needed it.\" The scoring output from the Jayhawks is the highest in a regular season game since a 4-0 win over St. Mary’s in September 2014. On Sunday the Jayhawks overpowered the Cyclones with 22 shots, which Iowa State goalkeeper Lindsey Hendon responded to with 10 saves. Kansas sophomore goalkeeper Maddie Dobyns made four saves. Francis said the team’s attacking chemistry is also building as a result of positional changes for Hagan and Roberts. Starting last Friday, in a 2-1 loss to Texas, Hagan was moved from forward to right wing and Roberts was moved into the central midfield. Those changes have both seemed to pay off in the short-term. \nAfter defeating the Cyclones, the Jayhawks have now won four of their last five games, with the lone loss coming to the Longhorns in the Jayhawks' conference opener. Kansas returns to Rock Chalk Park on Friday night against Baylor. Kansas will be seeking it's second conference win and looking to win its third match in a row against Baylor. \n— Edited by Abby Stuke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:39:05.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
