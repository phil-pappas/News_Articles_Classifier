European soccer executive Platini will join world soccer chief Sepp Blatter in fighting lengthy bans.\nAdChoices UEFA president Michel Platini has appealed his 90-day suspension imposed by FIFA amid the ongoing corruption investigation involving world soccer's governing body.\nMORE: U.S. vs. Mexico, 9:30 p.m. ET Saturday | Three keys for U.S. | Three keys for Mexico\nPlatini and FIFA president Sepp Blatter were suspended Thursday, with Blatter accused of making a \"disloyal payment\" to Platini in 2011.\nBoth men deny any wrongdoing. Blatter appealed his suspension on Friday . He also allegedly signed an \"unfavorable\" contract with the Caribbean Football Union in 2005 that market experts claim handed over World Cup television rights for a fraction of their market value.\nSouth American soccer leaders backed Platini's appeal.\n\"The presumption of innocence is a fundamental right that has to be considered,\" CONMEBOL, the organization's acronym, said in a statement on its website. \"Mr. Platini has not been found guilty of any charge, therefore the provisional ban jeopardizes the integrity of the electoral process to the FIFA presidency, of which Mr. Platini is a candidate.\"\nPlatini had been in the running to replace Blatter as FIFA president but his bid appears in doubt following the week's events. Reports suggest FIFA's Executive Committee could postpone the elections scheduled for February 2016.\nFIFA confirmed Friday an extraordinary meeting would be held later this month, during which a possible postponement is likely to be discussed.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2015-10-09/usa-mexico-match-el-tri-dos-a-cero-preview", "http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2015-10-09/sepp-blatter-fifa-suspension-michel-platini-jerome-valcke", "http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2015-10-09/mexico-usmnt-match-preview-dos-a-cero-matchups", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2015-10-09/usa-mexico-concacaf-cup-match-rose-bowl-jurgen-klinsmann-confederations-cup", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:59:13.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
