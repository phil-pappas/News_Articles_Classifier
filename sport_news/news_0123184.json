Recent history, however, is not on the Aggies' side. Overall, the Bulldogs have won six straight games played in the series and nine of the last 10 overall. Utah State has a great chance to turn the tide of the series if it take care of the following three keys. Run the ball\nThis week's keys to a win start exactly how last week's ended: Run the ball. After last week's win against Colorado State the Aggies have now won 18 straight games with a 100-yard rusher and 20 of its last 21 games when they run at least 40 times in a game. Additionally, the Aggies are 12-1 in the last three seasons when they control the ball for more than 32 minutes. The lone loss came at Utah 30-26 in 2013, a game that the Aggies were in control of for nearly three quarters. \nWhile correlation does not necessarily equal causation in the above stats, one thing is clear: The Aggies win when they control the ball. This bodes well for the Aggies as Fresno State has given up 258 yards a game on the ground and over 5 yards a carry against FBS foes. LaJuan Hunt, Devonte Mays and Myers should have a field day against a bad Bulldog rushing defense. Limit mistakes\nDespite the recent history, Utah State is a better team than Fresno State this year. The Aggies need to limit mistakes. They cannot afford to give Fresno State opportunities to score on a short field or get behind the chains offensively with undisciplined penalties. Utah State head coach Matt Wells spoke about the importance of the Aggies cleaning up the penalties at Monday's press conference. \n\"A lot of those longer ones were created by some undisciplined penalties or stupid penalties,\" he said. You sometimes have aggressive penalties, which I'm OK with and we'll live with. We want to be aggressive on both sides of the ball. There are some undisciplined penalties that are presnap or they're mental penalties, and then there are some stupid penalties. We had both, and we've got to cut those out, and you've got to try to reduce the amount of aggressive penalties that you have.\" Get an early lead and force Fresno State to become one-dimensional\nThe Aggies jumping out to an early lead has multiple advantages, outside of the obvious. \nAn early lead will force the Bulldogs to become one-dimensional putting the game on the shoulders of either Zach Greenlee or redshirt freshman Kilton Anderson. Greenlee has managed to turn the ball over less than his predecessors this year for the Bulldogs, but his completion percentage is below 50. Anderson, if reports are right , will get his first start of his college career against the confusing Aggie defense. The one-dimensional Bulldog offense will allow a stout Aggie defensive line to pin their ears back and get after Greenlee all night. \nFresno State has an 11-1 record in Mountain West games played at home in Bulldog Stadium. It is important that Utah State jumps out ahead of the Bulldogs early to take the crowd and home-field advantage out of the game. Wells knows just how hard it is to play in Bulldog Stadium. \n\"I know Fresno State's reputation, I know Tim DeRuyter's reputation and I have a tremendous amount of respect for him, his staff and what they do,\" he said. \"That place gets loud, and I know what the walk is like from the locker room down to the field. I've done it as a player, as an assistant coach and as a head coach. We've been in there and it's a great home-field atmosphere. They have a good team. There are seniors on both sides of the ball that played in the Mountain West championship game two years ago. This is a good team. Don't let that record fool you.\" \nThe game kicks off at 8:30 p.m. MT, and it can be seen on CBSSN. \nParker Robertson is a graduate of Utah State University, a freelance contributor and an avid fan of sports.
