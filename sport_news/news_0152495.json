No chance, you'll have more surprises yet. \n\"He has to be happy on the field and feel good about himself. He has an advantage over many others in that he has never suffered from a serious injury. And while he still has that flicker then great.\" \nRonaldinho joined Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain in 2003 and went on to win two Primera Divisions and a Champions League title, before joining AC Milan in 2008. \nThe Brazilian playmaker, who also helped his nation to World Cup glory in 2002, helped the Rossoneri to a Serie A crown in the 2010-11 campaign. \nHe had made just nine appearances for Fluminense.
