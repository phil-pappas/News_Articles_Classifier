No wonder they are still winless in Vancouver this year and have lost four straight games on a homestand that ends Tuesday with a visit by the 9-0 Montreal Canadiens, the NHL’s top team. \nAfter that, the Canucks embark on a season-long seven-game road trip. They were supposed to prepare for it by stockpiling points at Rogers Arena, but have collected just two of eight available on this homestand. \nThe Red Wings had lost four straight, too, but somehow were still in the game at the start of the third period and eventually won it on Gustav Nyquist’s breakaway at 3:50 of overtime after Canuck defenceman Yannick Weber was trying to change at 3-on-3. \nAfter taking a 120-foot pass from Detroit goalie Petr Mrazek, Nyquist shot off Ryan Miller’s catching glove to score the winner. \n“It’s the toughest one to swallow,” Canuck defenceman Luca Sbisa said of the collapse. “We were great the first two periods and in the third we were just too passive instead of just keeping going and playing the same way. Mistakes happen because we play a different way. We’re scared to win almost. You think you’re doing the right thing by sitting back and playing more defensively, but it just bites you in the butt.” \nLucky to be down only 2-0 after surrendering a bushel of Grade-A scoring chances, the Red Wings needed only 2 ½ minutes early in the third period to eliminate the deficit. \nTeemu Pulkkinen cut the Canucks’ lead in half with a breakaway goal at 4:25, muscling past rookie defenceman Ben Hutton and rattling a shot under Miller’s paddle. After Weber took a careless high-sticking penalty, the Red Wings’ power play tied it 2-2 at 6:59. Tomas Tatar found plenty of space to walk the puck into the high slot and lean on a screened wrist shot that beat Miller high on the stick-side. \n“Leading 2-0 in the third, we’ve got to come out stronger than we did,” Canuck blueliner Chris Tanev said. “We’ve got to figure it out here. We’ve got to be more prepared going into the period. It felt like we controlled the game the first two periods, and then came out flat again and it’s 2-2 before you blinked.” \n“They came out with energy and got themselves re-established and changed a few things and got some chances,” Miller said of the Red Wings’ resurrection in the third period. \nAsked how his team keeps finding ways to lose leads and games, the goalie said: “I think there’s a lot of different reasons.” He did not elaborate, but probably was unhappy Nyquist was abandoned by the Canucks at the Vancouver blueline. \nAfter starting the season 3-0-1, the Canucks are now 3-2-3. \nThe Canuck power play, which had scored only twice in the team’s first seven games, scored twice in 15 minutes against the Red Wings to build Vancouver’s lead. Both goals came from the second unit. \nTanev made it 1-0 at 13:03 of the first period, taking Alex Burrows’ pass and whipping a shot from about 35 feet past the glove of Mrazek. Burrows was also the provider on the second goal, at 8:02 of the middle period, when he quickly relayed Bo Horvat’s pass to Brandon Sutter, who scored with a one-timer from the middle of the slot. \nVancouver had numerous other scoring chances in the first two periods and really should have had the game clinched. But Mrazek stopped Burrows on a shorthanded breakaway, heard Jared McCann’s shot hit the post, saw Canuck Radim Vrbata miss the net on a 2-on-1 and watched Wings’ defenceman Danny DeKeyser pull the puck off the goal-line as Daniel Sedin’s shot was about to tumble in. \n“The mistakes that we make cost us,” Canuck captain Henrik Sedin said. “We have so many Grade-A chances and it feels like it’s been that way in a lot of games. We’ve got to be able to put the game away earlier, but for some reason we can’t put the puck in the net right now and it costs us late in games.” \nimacintyre@vancouversun.com \nTwitter: @imacvansun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:09:36.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
