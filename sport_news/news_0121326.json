We've done a couple of things this week that hopefully South Africa haven't seen.\n\"If you look at some of decisions the best players in the world make, it's about high-risk, high-reward.\"\nWales have recalled flanker Dan Lydiate, whose renowned tackling skills are set to be put to the test by the ever-physical Springboks, with Tyler Morgan drafted in at center as George North returns to the wing.\nSouth Africa have lost just two of their 30 Tests against Wales, although one of those defeats was a 12-6 reverse in Cardiff in their most recent meeting last year.\nBut Warburton said: \"Players never talk about history. I'm always the optimist. If it’s Tottenham against Manchester United, I always think Tottenham will win,\" said the Spurs fan.\n\"We have an excellent chance of winning.\"\nSouth Africa have had their share of injury problems. The international career of captain Jean de Villiers was ended by a broken jaw against Samoa while veteran lock Victor Matfield remains sidelined by a hamstring problem.\nBut in Jesse Kriel and Damian de Allende the Springboks have a young and talented midfield combination. There is an equally promising Test future in front of the second-row pairing of Eben Etzebeth and Lodewyk de Jager\nGatland, asked what he expected from South Africa this weekend, said: \"Same old, same old. They’re an incredibly physical team up front and we have to match them at scrum time and in the line-out.\"\nWales will also have to keep an eye on Bryan Habana, with the veteran wing needing just one try to top New Zealand star Jonah Lomu's World Cup record of 15.\n\"He's truly inspirational,\" said Meyer. \"Bryan is not just the type of guy who plays for himself and records.\n\"There's always one or two tries that are on that he will execute and hopefully Saturday he keeps on scoring a few tries. We are going to need one or two.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:20:19.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
