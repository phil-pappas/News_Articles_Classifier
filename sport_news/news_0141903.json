The winners all certainly did that as we recap the day's action from the Boys and Girls Club in Richmond Hill, Queens. Team Long Island put Early Risers to sleep, 68-52 The Early Risers were in one of the most interesting positions any team could be in. At 2-1, a win would have seen them go to 3-1 and more than likely, win their pool. A loss would drop them to 2-2 and 4th place in their pool, and with only 3 teams from each pool making the playoffs, they would've been out.Team Long Island, while without a chance to finish first in pool play, needed a win to advance to next weekend's playoffs, and knocking down 13 threes in a game certainly will help get the job done and that's exactly what the Long Island squad did as they downed the Early Risers, a team comprised of players who hail from Section 9, by 16.With just 6 players it was going to be tough for the Early Risers to stay as fresh as a Team Long Island squad that was 10 deep, but early on the Bobby Rahn coached team was able to stay tight behind the perimeter shooting of guard Nate Garvey (St. Joe's Montvale, NJ '16) .Garvey was able to knock down a couple treys in the early going, but the tempo was in favor of Team Long Island as Steve Torre (Kellenberg '16) was able to get good looks from the outside and connect, while Shane Gatling (Baldwin '16) was his running partner in the backcourt as they each hit 3 first half threes, and while it looked like they could've run away with it, Garvey and Chris Paul (Don Bosco Prep, NJ '17) were doing all they could to keep the team close.A big three ball right before the half by Gatling from the right corner really seemed deflating for the Early Risers though as Team Long Island took the lead from 4 to 7 as the halftime buzzer sounded to go into the breakup 35-28.The lead was soon pushed to double digits for the first time in the game when Alex Sorensen (South Side '16) connected on a long ball, as the Early Risers perimeter defense struggled to matchup with all the shooters that Team Long Island had. It seemed like it was a non-stop assault from the outside as the well-coached team from Nassau and Suffolk was able to keep the pressure on and keep draining it from deep.While the Early Risers made one last effort early in the 4th quarter getting the deficit to just 7 with 7:22 to go, it was soon negated by back to back corner threes from Lukas Jarrett (Northport '16) , and that ultimately did the team from Upstate, NY in.The combination of made threes and strong pressure defense by Team Long Island wore down the Early Risers as they took control late for a strong 68-52 victory.Team Long Island advances now to the Round of 16 next weekend, and they do it off of great performances from both Torre and Gatling who had 18 points apiece, while Jarrett added 8 as well in the victory.It was a tough loss, and a tough way to be eliminated from iS8 for the Early Risers who were decimated by injuries on Sunday. Garvey had a game high 22 points to lead the way with Paul adding 12 as well in the defeat. Early Risers best NYC Finest 51-47 The second game didn't go as the Early Risers had hoped, but to start the day they were able to give themselves a chance at the playoffs with a hard fought 4 point win over a scrappy and young NYC Finest squad.Both teams were extremely well coached, but Garvey made enough plays late, and Riley Hayes (Burke Catholic '16) was able to hit some clutch FT's in the closing seconds to seal it and give the Risers the win.Garvey and Paul each had 13 to lead the Early Risers, while Hayes added 12 and a good number of important rebounds to help them get the win.NYC Finest was comprised of players from John Bowne H.S. and the youth on the team showed that the PSAL Queens Class \"A\" school has a promising future as sharpshooting freshman guard Alejandro Vasquez (John Bowne '19) paced the Finest with 17 points, and another freshman in Errol James (John Bowne '19) chipped in with 11 as well to help the cause that came up just short. H.S. of Construction shackles Frederick Douglass Academy 76-54 They may not have played in the most difficult pool but you have to give the H.S. of Construction credit as they navigated their way through pool play to finish 4-0 during the regular season, the only team in the iS8 Fall Tip Off Classic to finish unbeaten as they cruised late past a game FDA team by 22.While it took them a while to eventually put away a tough and hardnosed Frederick Douglass Academy, a PSAL Class \"A\" team in Manhattan, Construction was able to jump out to a quick 13-3 lead, and they never were truly challenged the rest of the way. Jordan Wright '16 was able to slither his way into the lane for Construction and finish around the rim against the Lions bigs in the paint, and Marcus St. Furcy '16 showed good range and rhythm from the outside to light it up from deep early on.The lead for the Red Hawks stayed between 10-15 for most of the first 3 quarters as Construction lacked the fire to really put away FDA, that was until the 4th quarter came around and they put the Lions away. Wes Nelson '16 did a nice job for the Red Hawks in transition with the ball in his hands, and Wright has really proven to be an underrated leader and all around threat as the backcourt duo pushed the ball up the floor time after time, pressured the ball constantly, and pulled away late for the dominating 76-54 victory.Wright had a game high 21 points to lead Construction in the winning effort, with St. Furcy chipping in with 10 points, and Nelson, Bryshon Bryant '16 , and Micaiah Goosby '16 all adding 8 points each in the win.No one was really able to get the FDA offense jumpstarted as they struggled to get any sort of offensive rhythm going at all in the game. James Blair (FDA '17) led the Lions with 10 points in the loss, and it was Steven Cherry (FDA '16) who scored 8 as well in the defeat as FDA was officially eliminated from the playoffs at iS8. Team Albany eradicates Hoops 4 Health, 97-73 The day did not start off good for Team Albany as they were supposed to play their first of two games on the day against the Shooting Stars, but that game did not take place because the Brooklyn based team was found to be using a player that played with another team in the tournament.With that player no longer allowed to suit up for them, they only had 4 players on hand to play the opening game and after waiting for over 30 minutes, the game was officially forfeited to the Shooting Stars.After having a break before their second game, Team Albany was able to find a couple more players, and coming into the game angry because of the forfeit loss, they took it out on Hoops 4 Health.The game was actually close for a half, but thunderous dunks by a trio of George Westinghouse H.S. players in Gerald Williams '16 , Malick Riley '16 , and Arsheen Jones '16 allowed Team Albany to pull away in the 4th quarter as they rolled past Hoops 4 Health by 24.Jones had 21 to pace the way for Team Albany in the win, while it was Riley with 18, Williams with 17, and Tyrone Waring '16 with 14 to lead the Westinghouse heavy team to the victory.While they had to forfeit a game this morning, and possibly one other as well, it still looks like Team Albany is in good shape to advance to the iS8 playoffs next weekend, while Hoops 4 Health finished the iS8 regular season winless and will have to wait until the spring to try their luck again in the prestigious tournament.
