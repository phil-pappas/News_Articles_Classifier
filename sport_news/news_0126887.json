That the Warriors took unbeaten and untied Pinkerton Academy to extra time was an impressive accomplishment but losing 2-1 on a goal by Julia Bousquet with 7:40 remaining in the second 10-minute overtime session still stung. “They should feel good about their effort,” coach Mike Jackson said. “They’re playing good competitive soccer and we’re having close results with traditional top teams.” It was Winnacunnet’s fifth overtime game this year. The Warriors are now 4-5-3 with two overtime losses. Pinkerton (12-0-0) escaped Hampton with its record unblemished. Winnacunnet had its chance, though. With approximately 15 minutes left in the second half the game was still scoreless – thanks in large part to Warrior goalie Emily Parks (12 saves). In a span of minute, Parks deflected on-target Pinkerton shots by Courtney Velho (in tight) and Bousquet (mid-range chip) enough to have them hit the goal frame and stay out. Both times Winnacunnet’s defense did enough to clear the ball out. After that onslaught, Winnacunnet began to regain its footing and it was junior midfielder Claire Gourgeot who found some space near the top of the box after one of several speedy advancements. This time she was knocked over as she struck a shot that advancing Pinkerton goalie Sammy Mitchell (5 saves) was able to smother. The trail official ruled that Gourgeot fell because she was being pulled down by a Pinkerton defender, resulting in a penalty kick. Winnacunnet’s Callan Kennedy wasted little time setting up the PK and then sharply depositing in the ball into the upper-left quadrant of the net to give Winnacunnet a 1-0 lead with 14:25 to play. “We practiced penalty kicks and we have set people and they can take them when they’re on the field,” Kennedy said. “You have to go with whatever you think is best and not second-guess yourself.” Pinkerton responded quickly, with Keara Doolan tying the game with 11:31 to play on a well-struck shot from 15 yards out after receiving a nifty pass from Nicole Alves. Alves had received a well-placed chip pass at the top of the box and then worked free from multiple defenders. In the first overtime, Alves nearly won it with a well-placed shot but Parks was able to time her leap and tip the ball up and over the cage. “Emily had at least three, if not four or five, saves that were spectacular on shots that were definitely going to be goals,” Jackson said. Which made the ending of the game seem a bit unfair. Pinkerton had knocked a ball back toward the Winnacunnet penalty area. Unlike many of the Astro advancements, this one seemed to lack precision or a specific intent but it created a dangerous situation where Parks had to make a commitment to come out and play it. She got to the ball in time and struck it cleanly with her foot. The problem was that Bousquet was also playing with hustle and desire and had tracked the ball. Parks’ attempted clear struck Bousquet in the midsection and then ricocheted behind Parks and toward the Warrior goal. Bousquet won the foot race to the free ball and banged in the game-winner. Teammates, coaches and Mitchell, the Pinkerton keeper, were all quick to remind Parks that without her saves in regulation and the first overtime, there wouldn’t have been a second overtime. Parks said she understood their intent but felt the goal still came down to her. “It’s kind of hard being a goalie. You put the game on your shoulders,” Parks said. “I really appreciate my teammates telling me the good saves I made but as a goalie you remember the ones that go in.” Jackson said that overall the game showed Winnacunnet’s continued improvement. The Warriors generated multiple scoring chances and took 14 shots. Pinkerton had 23 shot attempts. The defense did a good job of protecting Parks and battling in loose-ball situations. For the most part the Warriors were able to play at a high pace, despite being without injured and senior midfielders Savannah Spencer and Nicole Liebundgut. “They are connecting the dots about the ingredients of a winning team,” Jackson said. “I keep telling them, they are talented and they have what it takes to win. It would be nice to get that breakthrough win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:05:19.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
