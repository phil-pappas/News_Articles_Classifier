Both teams have lost three of last four this season. ... This will be St. Louis' first home game since Sept. 27. ... In last meeting, Phil Dawson made four field goals but missed potential winning kick near two-minute warning after snap was bounced. ... Browns have gone to OT last two games, beating Baltimore two weeks ago and losing last week to Denver. They were driving for potential winning field goal before Josh McCown was intercepted for second time with 44 seconds left in regulation against Broncos. ... Gary Barnidge is first Browns TE to catch TD pass in four straight games since Ozzie Newsome in 1981, including two scores last week. ... Browns intercepted Peyton Manning three times last Sunday. ... Rams have 19 sacks, tied for third in NFL. Robert Quinn has four sacks, tied for sixth, and Aaron Donald has 3 1-2. ... Rams rookie RB Todd Gurley has rushed for 305 yards with 6.2-yard average over last two games. ... QB Nick Foles threw four interceptions last week after totaling one in first four games. ... K Greg Zuerlein was 1 for 4 on field goals in last game; all three misses were from at least 50 yards, with one blocked. Fantasy Tip: Look for Gurley to get another heavy workload with backup Tre Mason hampered by ankle injury that limited him to five snaps and two carries in last game. Rams will look to exploit a run defense that has given up three individual 100-yard games in last four weeks.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCONNECT Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
