At the moment that same individual is lying on the floor in his own blood, and subdued and no longer able to carry on his criminal actions of any sort that can endanger others”, Doron said, adding “there was no justification or need for the defendant to contribute to the violent actions carried out after that point.”\nIn his closing statement, Doron called on the public not to take the law into their own hands and to act “as a just society.”\nCohen’s attorney, Ido Porat said of his client that “they say he is to blame for the lynch but the only lynch here is the way my client is being lynched in the press.”\nPorat said “this is exactly the type of case where we say it could either be worthy of commendation or condemnation. It’s obvious that at the moment that he was hitting or kicking the victim, at that point he was certain that he was a terrorist.”\n“What would have happened if the same victim – my heart is with him - really had been god forbid a real terrorist holding a gun or a bomb at the same time that he was struggling for his life. He could pull the gun and fire it at people, what would we say then about the defendant? Wouldn’t he in that case have been a hero of Israel? I would like this case to be seen in the right proportion.”\nIn the end, Doron ordered Cohen and the second defendant released on NIS 10,000 bond and ordered that both of them not contact any other defendants for the next 30 days.\nHe will report for meetings, he will pay 10k and he can’t reach the others for 30 days.\nThe Negev police announced on Wednesday night that they had arrested four suspects for the mob attack on Haptom Zarhum, 29, who died on Sunday night after he was shot by a security guard and beaten by several civilians who thought he was a terrorist. As he laid bleeding on the floor and not moving, a few civilians kicked him in the head and dropped a metal bench on his head.\nOn Wednesday, police announced that an autopsy had determined that Zarhum had died from the gunshots and not the beating.\nThe two other defendants will be in court later on Thursday.\nPolice said they expect to make further arrests.\nThe shooting and beating of Zerhum happened just after a terrorist named as Muhand al-Uqbi, 21, an Israeli from Hura, shot and killed Golani Brigade soldier Omri Levy, 19, from Sdei Hemed, before snatching his gun and shooting at least 10 other people.\n ", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js", "https://accounts.brightcove.com/en/terms-and-conditions/."], "published": "2015-10-22T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:56:32.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
