Rather, he typically blocks for the defending mythical national champion’s stable of college-caliber running backs.\nToday, during Gorman’s homecoming game against Durango, Lazarou got a rare carry close to the endzone. He responded with a 1-yard touchdown run, helping the Gaels finish off Durango 69-7.\n“He’s been blocking for these guys for three years,” Gorman coach Kenny Sanchez said. “Glad we finally got him his first touchdown.”\nBiaggo Ali-Walsh, Gorman’s dynamic junior running back, rushed for two touchdowns and 102 yards on just two carries. Quarterback Tate Martell passed for three touchdowns — two to Brandon Gahagan — before giving way to the second team, including senior Troy Wilewski, who rushed for a touchdown.\nRay Brewer can be reached at 702-990-2662 or ray.brewer@lasvegassun.com .
