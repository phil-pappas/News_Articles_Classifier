The end of Chuck Kennerson’s formal coaching career came to an end in 2012. But there is no timetable on the end of his impact. And considering he started his coaching in Honeoye in 1977, his impact was and remains significant. Little League baseball, modified basketball for boys and girls, junior varsity and varsity softball, and soccer. Ah, soccer. His passion. If anything in the world of athletics surpassed his love for the beautiful game, it was working with young athletes. Coaching, teaching, mentoring. Being there. The work of a coach, of course, goes beyond the pitch, diamond and hardwood. There are countless questions. Many, many pointers. Even more miles on a bus for road trips, or even in his own car to scout opponents. It all adds up, and it’s at the core of what Kennerson brought as a coach, teacher and role model to hundreds of kids, and fellow coaches, through the years. He’s given so much, and that’s why the Honeoye community and Richmond Recreation Softball League have no qualms in asking you for a single day to give back. Saturday is the day that a co-ed softball tournament will be played at Sandy Bottom Park off of West Lake Road in Honeoye. It’s a $200 entry fee per team, and it’s for Kennerson, who is battling an illness. Grace Wood, current girls soccer coach at Honeoye, says 100% of the proceeds will help Kennerson pay medical expenses. A silent auction also will help, in addition to raffles and other events through the day to raise funds. Organizers are looking for donations to be raffled and auctioned. If you grew up playing sports in Honeoye, you no doubt experienced Kennerson’s generosity. But he was much more than just a coach. He was there for open gyms that kept kids off the couch and out of trouble. He worked with goalies on extra drills and even following retirement, he’s been a steady presence for Honeoye athletics through booster programs and as a fan in the stands. This is a man who donated money from his own pocket to help with costs associated with the lights after they were installed at the Honeoye soccer fields. From time to time, he’d purchase Rochester Rhinos soccer tickets for an entire team at Honeoye. He bought team calendars and passed them out to any Honeoye kid who wanted one. “He’s the most humble but most giving person I’ve ever met,” says Wood. His dedication was, and is, genuine. It’s easy for a coach to coach any game. But it takes a special person to coach and teach, to recognize that the athletic field indeed is an extension of the classroom. Kennerson is that kind of coach, that kind of man. So whether it’s been six weeks or six years since you last picked up a glove or bat, it’s time to get back on the diamond to help a man who has helped so many over the years. It’s in our nature as humans to lend a hand to those who deserve it, and there is no question that Kennerson is deserving.
