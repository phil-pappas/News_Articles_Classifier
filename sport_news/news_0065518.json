Today, coach Bielema chose to respond.\n\"If that was an ass kicking, I'd love to see what last year was,\" Bielema said of Kingsbury, according to The Associated Press . \"I'm happy he got to vent.\"\nBielema was making reference to the Razorbacks winning 49-28 against the Red Raiders last season in Lubbock.\nAfter defeating Arkansas in their stadium last weekend, Kingsbury issued comments directed at Bielema in response to comments made by Bielema at a Texas High School Coaches convention.\n\"He stood up and said, 'if you don't throw to the fullback, we'll kick your ass and if you throw it 70 times a game, we'll kick your ass,'\" Kingsbury said in the postgame press conference. \"He just got his ass kicked twice in a row and probably next week by (Texas) A&M, as well.\"\nTexas Tech's head coach was eager to leave the comments in the past and move forward to Saturday's matchup against No. 3 TCU during his weekly press conference on Monday.\n\"I've moved on from it,\" Kingsbury said. \"What was said was said and we're getting ready for TCU.\"\nBielema added he wasn't referencing Kingsbury individually, but instead sharing his views of spread offenses.\nBielema on Kingsbury: \"Itâ™s like, 'Come on, brother, donâ™t be so sensitive.
