In addition, there are four training-camp players who likely will be headed to the team’s D-League affiliate in Maine.\n“I’ll visit with (coach) Brad ( Stevens ) sometime this week to discuss it,” said Ainge, the team president, before last night’s preseason game against the Nets. “We’ll decide by Saturday.”\nPerry Jones is still looking like the odd man out among those with guaranteed deals, though it’s certain the Celts will be looking at potential trades this week to loosen their roster logjam through means other than a cut.\nCoty Clarke , Malcolm Miller , Levi Randolph and Corey Walden all should have a chance to play for Maine.\n“We’ve used our players in practices and drill work, and they all have helped the Celtics in training camp,” said Ainge, who, like Stevens, appreciates the relationship with the Red Claws.\n“I love it,” he said. “It’s great. We feel like we have a great owner there ( William Ryan ) and a terrific coach ( Scott Morrison ), and we have a great relationship with them. Last year we had the best record in the D-League, and it was beneficial to James ( Young ) to go down there and play. Hopefully we’re staying healthy up here, and some of our young guys can get some experience down there again this year.”\nSaid Stevens, “There’s familiarity between teammates, systems. You can send a guy down at 11 o’clock in the morning to play a 7 o’clock game, and they don’t have a huge learning curve. I really like our D-League setup and our coaches and everybody else. It’s a really good situation.”\nNot at full strength\nThe Celts were without David Lee , Jae Crowder and Isaiah Thomas last night.\n“David has strep throat,” Stevens said. “Jae Crowder had a little mild sprain of his thumb. He still practiced (Sunday) but we’re going to give him two days off here. We’re not practicing (Tuesday) so he’s not going to play, but he should be good to go practice-wise Wednesday.”\nThomas said he was kicked on the left shin in Wednesday’s game in Brooklyn, and the problem flared up in Sunday’s workout.\n“(He) should be ready to practice (tomorrow),” said Stevens. “But (we’re) just being cautious and safe here in the latter stages of the preseason.”\nHappy birthday coach\nNets coach Lionel Hollins celebrated his 62nd birthday here yesterday, though “celebrated” may not be the accurate word.\n“I laid around the hotel room all day getting ready for the game tonight,” he said. “I mean, what the hell is there to do when you’ve got a game that night?”\nWhen it was suggested he could have gone out for a nice meal, Hollins said, “In the afternoon? I wouldn’t consider lunch a nice meal. You’re not going to Smith & Wollensky or P.J. Clarke’s or any place like that, you know. I guess I could have gone to Legal Sea Foods.”\nStevens upbeat\nWith two preseason games to go (here Thursday against the Knicks, Friday in Manchester, N.H., against Philadelphia) after last night, Stevens is pleased with how things have gone in camp.\n“We’ve made progress,” he said. “I felt like we had made progress at this time last year, and then it was frustrating not to see it more in the results. But I felt like we were playing better. It showed itself true late, and we caught a little bit of a rhythm. And now it’s going to be about how much are we able to manage those ups and downs emotionally. Really, my ideal would be we stick to that process and we take the emotions out of it, but that’s not realistic. Hopefully, day by day, we improve as a team and we’ll play well enough to put ourselves in position to have a chance to win.”\nThe coach believes he has a better roster fit this season than last, saying, “Yeah, I would say that it’s very balanced. We have a lot of 4’s and 5’s. We’ve got obviously three point guards, not counting Evan Turner or the newly minted R.J. Hunter at the point idea . . . but we’ve got some depth on the wing too. We’ve got depth. That’s what we have. And we have to utilize it to our advantage. We may play less minutes each, and hopefully that allows us to be even better as a group. But we’re still, at the end of the day, going to have to play the guys that are playing the best to give us the best chance to win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:12:12.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
