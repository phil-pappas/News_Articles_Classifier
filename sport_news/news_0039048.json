Some guys have to shave every day, some every week or so and apparently some never have to involve themselves with the ritual.\nWestbrook was also asked about details regarding a few of his favorite things and of course didn’t pass up the opportunity to promote his own forays into the fashion world, such as his cologne, shoes and eyewear . Of course there was no mention of his favorite aftershave. But if he had one, odds are it would be his own brand. And it wouldn’t have hurt to mention his recent line for Barney’s that is highlighted by his nipple-showcasing quasi-transparent shirts that feature mesh-like material across the chest and abdomen.\nWestbrook is of course renowned for his unmistakably individualistic fashion sense (also, see here and here ). So maybe a nipple shirt shouldn’t be all that surprising. But the fact he has never shaved? Very surprising, indeed.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2015/06/24/russell-westbrook-rocks-explicit-anti-cancer-shirt/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Star", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmlbaw.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBbnn36&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/10/22/russell-westbrook-says-he-has-never-shaved/", "http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2015/09/16/russell-westbrook-showcases-unique-sense-of-style/", "http://www.maxim.com/entertainment/sports/article/russell-westbrook-talks-his-court-indulgences", "http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2013/04/25/youre-with-me-leather-what-in-the-hell-was-russell-westbrook-wearing-pics/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgoiL.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;NBA", "http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2015/06/10/russell-westbrooks-eyewear-company-unveils-nba-themed-frames-pic/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBml96G.img&quot;}}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;basketball_nba&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Liv", "http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2012/06/01/what-in-the-holy-hell-were-durant-and-westbrook-wearing-last-night-pics/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmjB2P.img&quot;}}", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/BKQ29B/MSN-Prime&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Will"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:39:10.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
