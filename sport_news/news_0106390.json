Adam Schiff is a Los Angeles Dodgers fan, but the California Democrat delivered on a bet he made with good friend and New York Mets fan Rep. Steve Israel, of New York, Friday on the House floor, singing \"Meet the Mets\" while wearing a tie emblazoned with the Mets logo. \nHe ended with a plea for his time to expire and a jab at the New York Yankees. \nSchiff will also send Israel gourmet popcorn from Burbank, California as part of the bet on the Dodgers-Mets series earlier this month. \nThe Mets won the series 3-2 and have since moved on to the World Series. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
