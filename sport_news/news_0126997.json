So far, he's not showing any sign of jet lag.\n\"I played nicely again today and had a decent second day,\" Poulter said. \"I'm feeling a bit tired but playing good and I'm right there in the mix. It's nice to be in this position.\"\nDustin Johnson was the biggest name to miss the cut after a 72, which put him one stroke above cut level of even par.\n\"I played terribly. I didn't drive it good and didn't hit my irons good. I didn't do anything good really,\" Johnson said.\nAlso missing the cut was former major winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland (72), defending champion Scott Hend of Australia (74) and Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez (73). Jimenez was chasing a fifth Hong Kong title.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
