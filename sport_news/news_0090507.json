When casein is digested, it releases opiates called casomorphins. Casomorphins impact the dopamine receptors and trigger the addictive element. There you have it.\nSo how exactly did we figure this out? (And who can we thank for validating our addiction?)\nResearchers at the University of Michigan studied two groups. All of the participants filled out something called the Yale Food Addiction Scale to see which foods they found addictive.\nThe first group of participants then identified which of 35 listed foods were most associated with addictive-like eating. The second group took the same 35 foods and identified which food attributes, like fat grams, were related to the addictive-like eating.\nLong story short: Pizza was the most addictive food on the list. And guess what's on pizza? Cheese. There's no word on any support groups in the works for cheese addiction, but if we hear of any we'll be sure to let you know.\n>> Watch the vid eo report.\nTrending on Facebook\n2015 is on track to be the hottest year ever recorded A lot of NFL players hate 'Thursday Night Football' Shelter dog that bit toddler granted a stay from court-ordered killing A Mediterranean diet could give you a big, youthful brain All the emojis you ever wanted are now quite literally at your finger tips More popular and trending stories", "external_links": ["http://www.midss.org/content/yale-food-addiction-scale-yfas", "https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://www.newsy.com/videos/your-cheese-addiction-is-real/#ooid=FkM3NjeDqVI71Mm-oIEXCBqpYM31BZ7G", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334652/"], "published": "2015-10-22T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:47:03.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
