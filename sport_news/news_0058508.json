A native of Carbonear, Newfoundland, Cleary racked up 275 points (124-151-275) in 609 games with Detroit during his 10 seasons with the club, in addition to contributing 49 points (23-26—49) in 111 playoff games while donning the winged wheel. Most notably, Cleary was a member of the Red Wings' 2008 Stanley Cup-winning squad. \nCleary, 36, has previous experience in the AHL, having tallied 101 points (31-70—101) in 97 games with the Portland Pirates (1998-99) and Hamilton Bulldogs (1998-00). Prior to turning pro, the 6-foot-1, 205-pound forward was a two-time OHL First-Team All-Star, racking up 323 points (127-196—323) in 220 games with the Belleville Bulls from 1994-98. \nDetroit's second choice, 48th overall, in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, Ouellet collected 16 points (1-15—16) and a plus-24 rating in 52 games with the Griffins last season. The 6-foot-1, 200-pound blueliner also appeared in 21 games with Detroit during 2014-15, notching two goals, an assist and a plus-four rating, including his first NHL point (assist) on Nov. 22 at Toronto and his first NHL goal on Nov. 28 at New Jersey. During the 2015 Calder Cup Playoffs, Ouellet appeared in 16 games with Grand Rapids and led team defensemen in scoring with six points (1-5—6) and a plus-six rating. \nIn January, Ouellet was named to the AHL's Western Conference All-Star Team but was unable to compete due to being on recall with the Wings at the time of the 2015 AHL All-Star Classic. A native of Bayonne, France, Ouellet has tallied 33 points (5-28—33) in 122 career AHL games with the Griffins since 2013. \nThe Griffins will drop the puck on their regular season tomorrow against the Bakersfield Condors at Rabobank Arena at 10 p.m. EDT, before squaring off against the San Diego Gulls the following night at Valley View Casino Center at 10:05 p.m. EDT. Next weekend, Grand Rapids will kick off the home portion of its schedule with back-to-back games against the San Antonio Rampage on Oct. 16-17 at 7 p.m. at Van Andel Arena.
