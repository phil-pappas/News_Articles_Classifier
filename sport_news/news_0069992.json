Eight defensemen practiced with the Bruins in the days leading up to their Oct. 8 season-opener. Captain Zdeno Chara's upper-body injury made his status questionable, but coach Claude Julien still had seven other blue-liners — one more than he ever dresses for a game — to choose from. Therefore, the best defenseman available at AHL Providence was effectively No. 9 on the organizational depth chart. Less than two weeks later, Tommy Cross, who — not one of the eight skating with the B's when the season started — is among the Bruins' top six. This is no overnight sensation story, though. Cross had embarked on his fourth season at Providence, where he'd been named captain, when the Bruins summoned him to replace Joe Morrow, who was too sick to travel for a two-game road trip to Colorado and Arizona. At 26, Cross — drafted back in 2007 — is older than four of the eight defensemen still with the team. \"It’s a great feeling,\" he said of his long-awaited jump to the NHL. \"I'm still very excited.\" The Bruins, meanwhile, are very grateful for how prepared Cross was to step into the lineup. Chara was back by the time last week's trip began, but they were 0-3 with a league-worst 16 goals against, and having difficulty setting their defensive rotation. Veteran Matt Irwin had already been dispatched to Providence, Zach Trotman had been scratched twice after playing on opening night, and then Morrow got sick after playing in the first three games. The Bruins are 2-0 since Cross arrived, allowing a much more reasonable five goals over those two games. He has averaged a little over 14 minutes, logging an even plus-minus rating with a short-handed assist in Saturday's 5-3 win at Arizona. \"Play solid, keep it simple, chip in wherever possible, whether it's on the penalty kill, 5-on-5 — whatever matchup it is,\" Cross said of both his role, and his goal for as long as he's in the lineup. \"Just take care of my responsibility, which usually is to defend well, move the puck, and play a simple game.\" When the Bruins drafted Cross in the second round (35th overall) in '07, there were thoughts he might develop into a productive, puck-moving defender, but he was most effective as a steady, smart player with good leadership abilities. Rapid development wasn't in the cards, however. Cross had three knee surgeries during his amateur career, spent mostly at the high school/prep level in his native Connecticut before four seasons at Boston College, where he was a two-time NCAA champion and senior captain. \"Sometimes it takes a little while to get back to 100 percent\" after surgeries, Cross said, \"but I never think back to that stuff. That stuff doesn't even cross my mind.\" Sometimes, it also takes a little while for some pro prospects to develop. Cross, who spent part of his rookie pro season (2012-13) in the ECHL, doesn't question or complain about his pace. \"You learn a lot, the more experience you get,\" he said. \"I think I've learned quite a bit in my first couple of years. I'm not sure age has a lot to do with it, but it definitely helps having been around the game, gone to a couple of training camps, things like that.\" Julien says Cross has \"made mistakes, just like anybody else, but I think his hockey sense is really good. He makes good, smart decisions, and that's been one of his strengths.\" The coach has found him particularly useful as a penalty killer, especially in Saturday's win over the Coyotes: Every penalty taken by the Bruins was assessed to a defenseman, including three (Chara, Kevan Miller, Adam McQuaid) who are full-time penalty-killers. \"(Killing penalties) is something I had to really work on in Providence, to help myself get more ice time and establish a role down there,\" Cross said. \"It's a good way to get yourself on the ice.\" Cross will undoubtedly see the ice again on Wednesday against the Flyers (8:05, NBCSN, WBZ-FM 98.5), and try to do what he's been doing all along. \"Be positive, enjoy the process, keep working hard, and love competing,\" he said. \"That's kind of been my mentality.\" By Mike Loftus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:45:33.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
