Luongo is 7-0 with four shutouts in the past two years against the Sabres. \nJake McCabe and Tyler Ennis scored for Buffalo. \nCanadiens 3, Rangers 0 \nMONTREAL -- The third line provided the offense to give Montreal a win over the New York Rangers at the Bell Centre. \nTomas Fleischmann, Dale Weise and Tomas Plekanec scored for the Canadiens, who are 5-0-0 to start the season for the first time in franchise history. \nCarey Price made 25 saves for Montreal, earning his 35th career shutout and claiming sole possession of fourth place on the Canadiens' all-time list.
