Ava also performed at the Orange County Fair this year and in 2014 and lent her voice to a “South Park” episode when she was 7 years old.\n“She’s still not allowed to watch it because of the content,” Lindberg said.\nThe 7th-grader said she hopes to create an EP record with a music video soon and to become a well-known singer one day.\nAva described her music as mostly country, but with mild elements of rock and pop. She writes her own songs, but often performs covers at her gigs. Her favorite artists include the Beatles, Taylor Swift and Katy Perry.\nLakers spokeswoman Lisa Estrada said they first received a submission from Ava in 2013, but didn’t pick her until the most recent one. Pregame entertainment varies from choirs, solo singers and band members, Estrada said.\nAva will sing before the Lakers’ 7:30 p.m. preseason game against the Portland Trail Blazers at the Staples Center, though it is unclear whether the performance will be aired on television.\nContact the writer: 714-796-7949 or imojadad@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:44:46.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
