This is the kind of unsolicited suggestion box that powerful professional coaches have always happily employed, because they can and because they care. Anybody who’s heard stories about how Babcock operated in Detroit for a decade knows he’s earned a reputation for making personnel suggestions with force and confidence.\nCertainly you couldn’t have blamed him for scanning the lineup of Friday night’s opponent and thinking to himself: “I want some of those.”\nBabcock, of course, could have had them all if he’d chosen to stay with the Red Wings. But a big part of the price of accepting a $50 million (U.S.) contract to coach the rebuilding Maple Leafs was the professional obligation to watch from the other bench as his old team routed his new one 4-0 at Joe Louis Arena.\nWhen Babcock accepted the gig in Toronto he sounded like a prophet of doom: “Pain is coming,” he said. The fan base figured he was talking about theirs. It turns out he was talking about his.\nThere doesn’t figure to be a ton of angst in Leafland about a season that’s so far winless. On Friday night, Toronto’s problem was goaltending, to a point. Jonathan Bernier was chased after giving up three goals on nine shots including, for the second straight start, the first shot of the game and, in a new twist to his early-moments inattention, the first shot of the second period.\nBut as two-game losing streaks go, the hockey team’s stumble into the Babcock era isn’t a Blue Jays-esque crisis among Toronto’s sports watchers. Such were the tamped-down expectations in the centre of the hockey universe that Wednesday’s solid work in the Air Canada Centre opener against Montreal, even if it , rated as a pleasant surprise to many on hand.\nBut Babcock clearly hasn’t seen it that way.\n“We need the points badly,” he said before Friday’s game.\nReally? But what about the virtues of implementing “the process” and learning to play “the right way.” What about staying on message?\n“We dropped our first one,” said the coach, “so it’s important we get on the winning side quickly.”\nIn other words, Saturday’s home game against the Senators can’t come quickly enough for the man behind the bench. In other words, it’s no stretch to suggest it won’t be long until Babcock brings out his wish list.\nAnd Friday’s game might have offered a hint about who he’ll be wishing for. The Maple Leafs have been heralded for showing patience in assigning William Nylander to the AHL’s Marlies. Nylander is only 19 years old. With all the Detroit influence in Toronto these days — with president Brendan Shanahan and coach Mike Babcock boasting strong ties to the Red Wings and their draft-and-develop ethos — the rough narrative makes sense. The Hockeytown gospel has for years espoused the importance of over-ripening prospects in the minors.\nBut the gospel, as we’re finding out this autumn, isn’t written on stone tablets. And so it was on Friday that a Detroit rookie named Dylan Larkin scored his first NHL goal — this on a left-wing-rushing top-shelfer that got Bernier the hook.\nLarkin is 19. Nylander is 19. Larkin was selected 15th overall in the 2014 draft, seven slots after Nylander, who went eighth overall. Larkin played all of six AHL playoff dates last season after deciding to forego his three remaining years of eligibility at the University of Michigan. Nylander, after playing pro in Sweden, played 37 games in the AHL last season.\nAnd maybe more to the point, Red Wings GM Ken Holland, even though he has built a reputation for rigidity in the way he oversees the development of players, has been heard raving about the much-needed “energy” that’s come with the presence of Larkin and other young players who made bids to make the team out of training camp.\nWhat did the Leafs lack on Friday? Energy, among many qualities. Speed, too. Oh, and a goal. They’ve scored one in two games now and it could have been accurately credited to James van Riemsdyk’s presumably unwitting skate.\nThere’s a 19-year-old in the organization who might be able to provide some of those things. And now that the Red Wings have given their imitators permission, one assumes it won’t be long until Babcock employs that suggestion box.\nMore on thestar.com\nThe reality bites, but it's not over yet: DiManno\nFive key moments from the Blue Jays’ marathon loss in Game 2", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:40:38.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
