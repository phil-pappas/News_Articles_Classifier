Not only are multiple teams without their starting quarterbacks at this point in the season, but plenty of skill position players have gone down as well. \nHere are the biggest injuries to watch this week. 1. Jeremy Maclin, wide receiver, Kansas City Chiefs (questionable, concussion) \nJeremy Maclin has passed through the concussion protocol and is now available to play. He's been consistent for the Chiefs this season, so it's safe to plug him into the lineup as you normally would this week. \nAdvice: Play him 2. Ben Roethlisberger, quarterback, Pittsburgh Steelers (questionable, knee) \nBen Roethlisberger appears to be another week away from returning from his knee injury. He practiced on a limited basis throughout the week, but he's listed as questionable, and the Steelers added another quarterback to their active roster this week. Leave Roethlisberger on the bench. \nAdvice: Sit him 3. Dion Lewis, running back, New England Patriots (questionable, abdomen) \nDion Lewis is not going to play against the Jets with an abdomen injury, according to Adam Schefter of ESPN. That settles any question over whether he should be in your lineup. Lewis' matchup wasn't great to begin with, and this makes the decision easy. \nAdvice: Sit him 4. Marcus Mariota, quarterback, Tennessee Titans (out, knee) \nThe Titans aren't going to risk it with their rookie quarterback. Marcus Mariota will sit out with his knee injury. Zach Mettenberger will start in his place, so adjust your lineups accordingly. \nAdvice: Sit him 5. Odell Beckham Jr., wide receiver, New York Giants (questionable, hamstring) \nOdell Beckham Jr. was limited in practice all week, but he fought through this same hamstring injury last week without much issue. Beckham is a stud and should probably be in your lineup regardless of the injury he's fighting through. \nAdvice: Play him", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:20:33.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
