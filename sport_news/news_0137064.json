In fact, its efforts are expanding and evolving like its collection.\nThe museum has a 150-piece permanent collection, including 80 pieces built for outdoor display. It has helped place countless pieces on display in prominent spots in Greenwood Village, Englewood, Denver and elsewhere.\nPerhaps the most notable piece it is associated with right now is a giant pickaxe and gold nugget sculpture titled \" Pikes Peak or Bust ,\" erected near the corner of 17th Street and Tremont Place in Denver in a joint effort with students from the Rocky Mountain College of Art + Design.\nThe museum maintains offices and free-to-the-public gallery space in the Englewood Civic Center, 1000 Englewood Parkway, and just recently opened a new exhibition there for local artist Joel Swanson.\nAdvertisement Still, the museum leadership is emphasizing pushing into new, uncharted territory.\n\"Our actual mission statement is 'Making art part of everyday life,' \" said Cynthia Madden Leitner , the museum's president and executive director. \"But we've progressed beyond that.\"\n\"We're always trying our hand at something new. We're never stagnant,\" added Tim Vacca, the museum's director of programs. \"We're a progressive, small museum constantly trying new things in the community.\"\nNo project embodies that like \" Element House ,\" the museum's six-years-in-the-making modular, off-the-grid house that has gone from the 3-D model phase to a physical prototype on private land in New Mexico that could open to the public in 2016. Madden Leitner and the museum contracted New York-based MOS Architects — founded by principals Hilary Sample and Michael Meredith — to construct the prototype, using state-of-the-art building techniques and power and water systems that are independent of public utility systems. Madden Leitner attended an awards ceremony in New York last week where MOS was recognized for work including Element House. It sits on a property owned by artist Charles Ross, near where he is building his naked-eye observatory and earthwork sculpture \" Star Axis .\"\n\"MOA really enjoys collaboration and partnerships,\" Madden Leitner said, referring to Element House and enumerable other projects the museum has been involved in since it got started in Greenwood Village in 1981 as a joint effort between Madden Leitner and her parents, John and Marjorie Madden.\nIn 1999, it moved into the second floor of the building that became the Englewood Civic Center before the city even relocated its offices there, Madden Leitner said. Lately there has been talk about the city moving out of the building , and while the museum is keeping an eye on that, its executive director is focused on the mission.\n\"We've moved four or five times. We could actually be anywhere but we stayed in Colorado for a reason,\" Madden Leitner said. \"Englewood is our home base. We're always going to maintain the relationships and the art here but we're looking forward to our future, too.\"\nThe museum owns Fiddler's Green Amphitheater and worked with its promotion partner, AEG Live Rocky Mountain, to make $5 million in upgrades there last year, updating the facility and adding green elements, like a \"living wall\" made up of various plants.\n\"I've always appreciated them for being a great asset to the community,\" Greenwood Village Mayor Ron Rakowsky said. \"It's a huge cultural plus. It provides a great opportunity for youngsters in particular that might not be exposed to the arts to grow up and enjoy it.\"\nEnglewood City Councilman Joe Jefferson also expressed his gratitude for the Museum of Outdoor Arts and a hope that its work in Englewood would extend well beyond its 35-year anniversary in 2016.\n\"I think they've helped make Englewood a cultural art destination. They put us on the map, so to speak,\" he said. \"I have every intention of continuing that partnership moving forward.\"\nJoe Rubino: 303-954-2953 or jrubino@denverpost.com", "external_links": ["http://charlesrossstudio.com/staraxis/", "http://www.cooperhewitt.org/national-design-awards/2015-national-design-awards-winners/", "http://www.mos-office.net/", "http://www.elementhouse.org/", "http://moaonline.org/", "http://www.rmcad.edu/", "http://joelswanson.net/", "http://moaonline.org/dbrmcad/", "http://moaonline.org/contactus/"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:03:50.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
