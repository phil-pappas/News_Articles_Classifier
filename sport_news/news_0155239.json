LSU is seventh in the nation in rush offense with 315 yards a game and has the nation’s leading rusher in tailback Leonard Fournette with 210 yards a game. \nThe Eagles, though, are very good against the pass as they are No. 7 nationally with 127 yards allowed game. But opponents are running so well against them, why pass? \nThe Tigers, meanwhile, are 123 rd in the nation in pass offense with 100.7 yards a game behind sophomore quarterback Brandon Harris, who is not listed in the top 100 quarterbacks in the nation in passing yards and is 239 yards behind No. 100. Harris is better in the pass efficiency department as he is No. 77 nationally and No. 11 in the SEC at 129.7 on 29-of-47 passing for a .617 completion percentage and 302 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. \nLSU coach Les Miles had planned to let Harris throw more against 24-point underdog Syracuse last week, but the Orange stayed so close in the game that Harris threw just 16 times, completing eight for 157 yards and a touchdown in a 34-24 win while Fournette gained 244 yards on 26 carries. \nHarris did average 19.6 yards a completion and hit wide receiver Travin Dural for 51 yards and wide receiver Malachi Dupre for an 11-yard touchdown for a 31-17 lead early in the fourth quarter. \n“He’s doing what we expect him to do, and he’s expected to do it more regularly,” Miles said. \nPENALTY UPDATE: Miles hopes to severely cut the number of penalties his team drew at Syracuse, which was 14 for 120 yards. He went over each infraction on film with the team and stressed not committing penalties at practice. \n“I think our team recognizes that to have the opportunity to do the things we want to do, we have to get better at that,” Miles said. “The guys who took the discredit for the penalties did so in front of their team.” \nPRIME TIME IN THE A.M.: The LSU-Syracuse game played last Saturday at 11 a.m. on ESPN drew more viewers at 3.2 million than any other game televised by the ESPN family of networks throughout Saturday. \nThe other games televised by ESPN on Saturday were Central Florida at South Carolina on ESPNU at 11 a.m., Vanderbilt at No. 3 Ole Miss at 6 p.m. on ESPNU, No. 14 Texas A&M versus Arkansas at 6 p.m. on ESPN, and Mississippi State at Auburn at 6:30 p.m. on ESPN2. \nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “I will never jump ship. I’m drowning with my brothers.” \n---LSU tailback Leonard Fournette on his Twitter account in reaction to media commentary over the last several days that he should not play his junior season next year to avoid injury and get ready for the 2017 NFL Draft. He has not been available to reporters this week.
