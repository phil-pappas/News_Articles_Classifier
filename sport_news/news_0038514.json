Sure, the greatest dunks we have yet to come for the year ahead. But the early fall still has its highlights that can set the tone for some players when they meet again when the season is in full swing.\nEnter DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis . Both players are in the West, and will be seeing each of other when the season gets past Christmas. They are evenly matched in their physique, skills, athleticism, and everything else except player ratings and tantrums .\nBut this dunk just makes you giggle and feel bad for Davis reaching like he can't hold his ground against Boogie. And it can make you want to pantomime this crossover X two-step to a banger on your own time. But soon we will see more from these two, and it's only going to get better for the 2014-2015 season.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com .\n[via UPROXX ]", "external_links": ["http://uproxx.com/dimemag/2015/10/demarcus-cousins-dunk-on-anthony-davis/"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:22:00.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
