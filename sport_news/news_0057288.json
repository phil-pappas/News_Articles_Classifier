(Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Ann Arbor — Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh was not thrilled with the officiating in the Wolverines' loss to Michigan State on Saturday.\nThe Wolverines were penalized eight times for 70 yards. Among those calls was a targeting on linebacker Joe Bolden, who was ejected from the game in the first half.\nHarbaugh was asked if it was fair to assume he was not happy with the officiating in total.\n\"Yeah, you could say that,\" he said.\nCook had rushed for a six-yard game which would have put the Spartans in third-and-3 at the Michigan 39-yard line, but the Bolden personal foul gave the Spartans a first down at the Michigan 24-yard line. Two plays later, MSU tied the game, 7-7, on an 11-yard run by LJ Scott.\n\"I tried to explain it to (the official) that Bolden was pushed in the back,\" Harbaugh said. \"It really should've been a push-in-the-back penalty. But his explanation was that the review people saw it the same way. Hard to fathom.\"\nDefensive end Willie Henry said the defensive players rallied around Bolden, who ran from the Michigan sideline along the outside edges of the field throwing up his arms to get the crowd cheering, slapped hands with fans in the front row and stopped at the mouth of the tunnel to take of his helmet and raise it toward his team.\n\"We go out there we play for one another, so when you see one of your brothers go down, it just hurt, because he's captain of the defense and leader on the field, so next man up,\" Henry said.\nHenry didn't dispute being whistled for a personal foul on an unnecessary roughness call on the final play of the third quarter. That gave Michigan State a first down, when the Spartans would have faced fourth-and-3.\nHe explained it.\n\"Just trying to finish plays,\" Henry said. \"Coach always talks about physical plays through the whistle. It was so loud out there I couldn't hear the whistle.\"\nDETROIT NEWS\nHarbaugh says UM will put 'steel' in its spine after numbing loss\nHarbaugh said the officials missed a call against the Spartans when, late in the fourth quarter, Michigan quarterback Jake Rudock caught his pass that had been deflected. He lost three yards and UM punted.\n\"I thought for sure I saw a facemask on Jake Rudock when the ball got deflected back to him,\" Harbaugh said. \"But it was … they just kept fightin, they just kept fightin' and fighting through things, which you're so proud of as a coach. Guys fought their heart out and we'll come out and we'll build and we'll steel ourselves against it.\"\nShowing support \nHenry said he spoke to punter Blake O'Neill after his fumble that led to the Spartans' victory.\n\"I told him to keep his head up,\" Henry said. \"Everybody wasn't perfect. I didn't have the best game. I feel like we've got the world in his hands. We've got a lot of trust in Blake.\"\nEarlier in the game, O'Neill had an 80-yard punt that was downed inside the 2-yard line.\nKicker Kenny Allen , who made three field goals for the Wolverines, said he also offered words of encouragement to O'Neill.\n\"I talked to him (and) I just told him we're behind him,\" Allen said. \"We support Blake through everything, and that's the kind of team we're going to be.\"\nAll-everything Peppers \nIf you're keeping score at home, here's the box score for safety Jabrill Peppers: Two tackles, three punt returns for 48 yards, including a long of 34, three kickoff returns for 81 yards, including a long of 49, and he made his official on debut on offense.\nPeppers had two catches for 35 yards.\n\"He did great in all phases,\" Harbaugh said. \"As he does so often, he played great.\"\nangelique.chengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:25:36.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
