Christopher Hanewinckel / USA TODAY Sports Oct 21, 2015 at 10:41p ET 0Shares \nGeorgia , currently looking up at Florida in the SEC East standings by a game, may have two key players returning for its all-important game against the rival Gators in a week. \nSophomore receiver Isaiah McKenzie has missed the last two games, and for an offense coming off a game in which they scored nine points, they could use all the help they can get. \nDuring the SEC's Wednesday teleconference, Georgia head coach Mark Richt gave the update with the team's star punt returner. \n“Isaiah was working yesterday and I think he got a little sore,” Richt said. “I don’t think it’s anything to worry about. My guess, I’d have to probably still say questionable. I’m optimistic right now.” \nEven more encouraging news on the injury front came when Richt indicated that star defensive end/linebacker Jordan Jenkins is expected to return to the field for the Florida game. \nIn a game where every point could be critical, having a player already having earned SEC Defensive Player of the Week honors could be huge to the Dawgs chances in Jacksonville.
