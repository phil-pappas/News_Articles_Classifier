Chief Minister Harish Rawat said this after inaugurating a conservation project for the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) and a management plan for the Nandor Sanctuary, Haldwani, on the first day of the Wildlife Week-2015, held at the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) auditorium here today. He also inaugurated a website of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve at the function. Rawat said the wildlife week celebrations should not be merely customary. Officials should draft a concrete policy to create awareness among villagers about the importance of conserving flora and fauna of the state. He said being a state with a 70 per cent forest cover, it was not only our duty to conserve forests and the ecology but it was also a national responsibility. The government was working to develop eco tourism in the state. Funds would not become a barrier to develop parks, especially those dedicated to butterflies and reptiles, he added. Rawat also inaugurated a photo exhibition on wildlife. The programme was presided over by Forest and Wildlife Minister Dinesh Aggarwal, who expressed concern over the increasing encroachment of forest land by residents, especially in the higher areas of the state. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Srikant Chandola, Dr Savita, Ashwani Kumar, Dhanjay Mohan, Meena Grewal, and Rakesh Shah ere present on the occasion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:21:16.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
