If we defend well and score then it shows the balance is right.\" \nDespite their gritty efforts, Wenger knows Arsenal still have little margin for error to make the last 16 and, asked if he thought his team would qualify now, he said: \"I don't know. We need a result at Bayern in our next game.\" \n\n\nHaving Giroud back to his best would certainly help. \nAfter losing his place as Arsenal's central striker to Theo Walcott this season, Giroud reminded Wenger of his qualities as he came off the bench to score the crucial opener. \n\"Giroud had a little dip in form, but I see in the last two weeks he is coming back to his best,\" Wenger said. \n\"You have to give him some credit. It's not easy because he is used to being in the team. \n\"But he is a winner and when he comes on he gives us a different option.\" \nThe only frustration for Wenger on one of the most memorable European nights of his 19-year reign was the hamstring injury that forced off Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey in the second half and could keep him out for some while. \n\"He's not happy. He told me it's a tough injury,\" Wenger added. \nAlthough they failed to score for the first time in 13 matches, Bayern shouldn't be too troubled by their first defeat of the season. \nThey remain top of Group F and Guardiola was adamant he had no reason to be critical of his players. \n\"We tried to dominate the game and had enough chances to win it or at least not lose it,\" he said. \n\"I like to win, so I'm not happy but we played with a lot of courage here. I can't explain why we didn't score. \n\"We took the ball from Arsenal. They have very good, fast players, but we were played with a lot of personality and showed we can compete here. \n\"We created enough chances to win, but the opponent was more clear in the last moments. Sometimes in these moments we have to be perfect and we weren't quite perfect.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:22:04.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
