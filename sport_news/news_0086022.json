Yildirim, who denied any wrongdoing, spent a year behind bars before being released pending the outcome of the trial and appeal process. \nTurkey later abolished the special court that tried Yildirim and other suspects in the case, paving the way for a re-trial. \nOn Friday, the Istanbul court overseeing the re-trial acquitted Yildirim and 12 other defendants. \nHundreds of Fenerbahce fans celebrated the decision outside the courthouse. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:18:34.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
