Thirty-five years ago, he invented Rotisserie League Baseball, a simpler version of what has morphed into today's high-stakes online fantasy game.\nWhen Okrent started his Rotisserie league in 1980, the entry fee for him and his nine buddies was $250 apiece. There were no daily payouts, much less the million-dollar bonanzas advertised by FanDuel and DraftKings, the two online fantasy sports sites facing intense scrutiny.\n\"This isn't the thing I did for many years or what I had in mind when I started the damn thing,\" Okrent told USA TODAY Sports. \"My intention was just for me and my buddies to have a good time in the summer of 1980. I had no intention beyond that.\"\nUSA TODAY\nFantasy player files lawsuit against FanDuel, DraftKings\nOkrent, a writer and editor, worked with fellow journalists to publicize Rotisserie League Baseball, and by the mid-1990s a full-blown fantasy sports craze was sweeping across the county.\n\"I've been apologizing to wives for 35 years and to the children whose fathers disappear into fantasy sports,\" Okrent cracked. \"My guilt has been overflowing for so many years that this (scandal) is just a tiny drop added to the ocean of it.\"\nThat last sentence was uttered partially in jest, said Okrent, who added in all seriousness that he welcomed the ongoing scandal â€” in hopes it'll root out any possible corruption and restore the enterprise to something closer to what he originally had in mind.\nOh, and for the record, Okrent said he stopped playing fantasy sports in 2009 and never tried it online. A fan of Chicago Cubs, he said found himself more and more interested in watching his beloved Cubbies rather trying to keep pace with fantasy sports junkies spending more time than ever crunching numbers and studying statistics.\n\"I don't want to do that,\" Okrent said. \"I want to watch Jake Arrieta.\"\n2 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799800743559166-AP-DAILY-FANTASY-FOOTBALL-75775550.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/37072ca041204258abd419ce4cca0df6f151951d/c=533-0-3199-2666/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797486444686910-BLM-DRAFTKINGS-FANDUEL.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/77c65a214d325e13ce7558bb23f45ce14358e95d/r=500x316/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799800743559166-AP-DAILY-FANTASY-FOOTBALL-75775550.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ecf7d3b52667e50e25abfba5d1d6fd87738c69d/c=317-0-3671-2522&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799800743559166-AP-DAILY-FANTASY-FOOTBALL-75775550.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LlD0UP&text=Grandfather%20of%20fantasy%20sports%20weighs%20in%20on%20DraftKings%2C%20FanDuel%20scandal&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LlD0UP&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-09T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:54:03.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
