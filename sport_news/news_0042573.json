Minnesota won 41-13. (AP Photo/Doug McSchooler) \nThe University of Wisconsin football team shouldn’t need to sweat out another close game until at least mid-November. \nThe Badgers’ next four opponents have a combined record of 9-14, including a 1-7 mark in Big Ten play — a stretch that begins Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium against a 1-5 Purdue team that, believe it or not, actually has more talent than most teams that lose to Marshall and Bowling Green. \nSome of that talent is young, though, and the Boilermakers have too many liabilities surrounding it. They just can’t maintain consistency on either side of the ball. \nIt partly explains why they outscored Michigan State 21-3 in the second half of a near upset, only to allow 28 third-quarter points to a struggling Minnesota offense the very next week. \nWhen Purdue isn’t playing well — which, let’s be clear, is almost always — its defense’s tackling can reach embarrassing levels. \nOnly seven FBS teams have allowed more runs of 20-plus yards than the Boilermakers. They missed a whopping nine tackles in that third quarter against Minnesota and allowed 326 rushing yards in the game. \nThe Gophers didn’t pass because they didn’t need to. Quarterback Mitch Leidner had 59 passing yards through three quarters — when the score was already 38-6. \nThe other side of the ball hasn’t put it all together, either. \nPurdue made a quarterback change after three games, benching returning starter Austin Appleby and inserting redshirt freshman David Blough. It was a move that will certainly help the Boilermakers’ future, but we’ve seen some serious growing pains over these first couple Big Ten games. \nIt appears Blough will one day be a solid Big Ten quarterback. He has a strong arm and can make every throw on the field. \nHowever, he needs to become more consistently accurate. He’s only completed 53.5 percent of his passes this season and has misfired on his fair share of passes to open receivers. \nYou can often tell just by watching that Blough’s a freshman, whether he’s throwing into traffic or making a mistake like the one below, where he tries to pull the ball away too late on a read option, causing a fumble that Michigan State recovers. \nOnly three FBS teams have accumulated more turnovers than Purdue’s 17 this season. \nIt doesn’t help that the Boilermakers haven’t always given Blough much time to throw. He’s handled pressure poorly at times in his first three starts and will put the ball in dangerous areas rather than throwing the ball away or taking a sack. \nTrue freshman Markell Jones is quickly becoming the focal point of Purdue’s offense. The running back is averaging 6.24 yards per carry this season and has scored six total touchdowns. \nI mentioned earlier that Purdue does have some talent, and Jones stands out as the best example. I’m no scouting expert, but this run against Michigan State made believe he’s a guy with NFL-level acceleration. \nThe score of that game tightened up mainly due to that run and a botched punt that set up Purdue inside the Michigan State 20-yard line. \nMeanwhile, the Boilermakers’ defense looked like a completely different unit. There were only two plays in the entire second half in which Purdue missed a tackle. \nEverything came together, and the Boilermakers almost upset a top-five team on the road. \nWhile that may scare Badgers fans heading into Saturday’s game, we have six weeks of evidence that suggests that half was an outlier (and six weeks of evidence that suggests Michigan State shouldn’t be anywhere near the top five). \nUW fans shouldn’t have much to worry about Saturday. The Badgers’ defense is good enough to contain Jones and pressure Blough into poor decisions, and Purdue still ranks outside the top 100 nationally in scoring defense, total defense and rushing defense. \nEnjoy a comfortable win in the Big Ten.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:36:53.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
