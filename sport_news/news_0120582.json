He added a sign that read, “ Tom Brady got burnt by the Colts last year.”\nBrady and the Patriots smothered the Colts, 45-7, in the A.F.C. championship game in January. But during the game, the Colts showed the officials game balls, supplied by the Patriots, that appeared to be underinflated. That prompted an investigation, a four-game suspension for Brady and a federal court case that overturned the penalty.\n“I only do this for Tom Brady,” said Gainey, an auto salesman. “We’ve always hated New England.”\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Jets 34, Redskins 20: Led by Ryan Fitzpatrick’s Dive, Jets Hurtle Into a Division Showdown OCT. 18, 2015 Sports of The Times: Jets Face Midterm Exam as Patriots Week Arrives OCT. 18, 2015 On Sunday, Gainey and the rest of the 66,000 fans at the stadium — some wearing “Deflatriots” T-shirts and rubber hats in the shape of deflated footballs — hoped the Colts would bury the Patriots and win a measure of revenge in the latest edition of a long-simmering rivalry that, in recent years, has been dominated by the Patriots.\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nIn the end, the Patriots continued their mastery of the Colts, winning, 34-27. It was the Patriots’ seventh straight victory over the Colts dating to 2010.\n“It’s always nice to come into Indianapolis and get a win,” Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said.\nWith the win, the Patriots moved to 5-0, one of five undefeated teams. The Colts fell to 3-3 but remained in first place in the A.F.C. South.\nIn the days before the game, both coaches played down the significance of the game. But thanks to the Deflategate scandal, the N.F.L. has beefed up the inspection and custody of game balls.\nAfter their inflation levels are checked before games, the balls remain with an N.F.L. representative until 10 minutes before to kickoff and are then given to each club’s ball crew. At randomly selected games, footballs used in the first half are also measured to ensure that they are properly inflated.\nSunday’s game was played indoors, so weather was not a factor. Nor was defense for much of the game. Both teams put together long drives, and Brady and Colts quarterback Andrew Luck often had plenty of time to throw. The score might have been higher, but penalties cut short several drives.\nThe game started auspiciously for the Colts. After having missed two games with a shoulder injury, Luck started the game by tossing sharp passes to T.Y. Hilton and Frank Gore. On fourth down from the Patriots’ 5-yard line, Luck lofted a pass into the end zone that Donte Moncrief hauled in for a touchdown, the first by the Colts on an opening drive in 21 games.\nCharacteristic of their recent shootouts with the Colts, the Patriots struck right back. Brady tossed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Julian Edelman, who rifled the ball against the wall in the end zone and let out a primal yell. The fight was on.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story After a field goal by Stephen Gostkowski of the Patriots, the Colts’ next drive stalled. But their punt pushed the Patriots deep into their end of the field. Brady threw a pass to Edelman, who bobbled the ball. Safety Mike Adams plucked it out of the air and sprinted 14 yards for a touchdown. Blue and silver confetti fell from the ceiling, and fireworks boomed.\nIt was Brady’s first interception this season.\nOffense, though, dominated the game, which included face-mask penalties and personal fouls but no major altercations. Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount ran 38 yards for a nifty score. Luck then eluded two tackles before tossing a touchdown pass to Hilton to complete an 80-yard drive.\nWith less than three minutes to go, Brady led the Patriots down the field. But the drive stalled twice because of penalties, and New England had to settle for a field goal to cut the Colts’ lead to 21-20 at halftime.\nIn the second half, the Patriots picked up where they had left off. Brady completed five passes for 76 yards, the last one to tight end Rob Gronkowski, who ran into the end zone for a 25-yard score.\nBelichick said he expected a “gadget game” filled with trick plays. Indeed, Colts Coach Chuck Pagano tried everything to slow the Patriots. He passed the ball on fourth down and attempted an onside kick that failed.\nThen, on fourth down at the end of the third quarter, Pagano attempted a mind-boggling play by lining up nine members of the punting unit on the right side of the field while safety Colt Anderson took a snap from wide receiver Griff Whalen. In a version of the swinging-gate play, the Colts were flagged for an illegal formation, and the Patriots took over at the Colts’ 35-yard line.\nBrady then threw his third touchdown pass, hitting Blount with an 11-yard toss to put the game out of reach. Chants of “Bra-dy, Bra-dy” from the smattering of Patriots fans were quickly drowned out. The Patriots fans, though, had the last laugh.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/19/sports/19subJETS/19subJETS-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/19/sports/19RHODEN/19RHODEN-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:49:28.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
