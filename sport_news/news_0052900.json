Hours later, Westerhuis apparently shot his family, started his house on fire and turned the gun on himself. \nThursday Mid Central had its first regular board meeting since the tragedy. Immediately after the tragedy, Mid Central's Director Dan Guericke hired attorney Scott Swier to represent the educational co-op and all questions were directed to him. \nAngela Kennecke: \"Can I ask you why you didn't have more oversight of the GEAR UP grant funds?\" Dan Guericke: \"That's a confidential matter with our attorney.\" \nAngela asked if he was suspicious of Scott Westerhuis, but Guericke walked away without answering. \nWhile Dan Guericke is avoiding all questions about Westerhuis and GEAR UP, he couldn't avoid leading a public meeting of Mid Central Co-op's board, made up of superintendents from 13 districts in the area. \nGEAR UP only came up once with a couple of minor expenses from before the contract was cancelled. \n\"That's a credit card bill for gas. It would be very difficult to separate that out,\" Guericke said. \nEven though no one was talking about the situation facing Mid Central, there was evidence the problems has taken their toll on the co-op. \n\"The distractions from our normal work, the strategic planning committee has not been able to meet, so we're a little behind on some of our work in regards to writing our annual report for last year,\" Guericke said. \nAfter discussing other grants and programs, the co-op then kicked out our camera. \n\"We are now declaring an executive session,\" Guericke said. \nThe superintendents have been in executive session for over an hour to meet with Mid Central's attorney Scott Swier. \nIn all, the group met behind closed doors for nearly three hours. \nMid Central's attorney tells me the board appointed Stephanie Hubers as interim business manager for Mid Central and they hired an independent financial consultant and appointed four people to a budget committee.
