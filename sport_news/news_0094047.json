They have seven points from five matches. \nNorthEast coach Cesar Farias did not have to make too many changes to the team that defeated Chennaiyin FC 2-0 in the previous clash. \nThe hosts had a spring in their steps early in the game and had the first chance in the 22nd minute when they appealed for a penalty after Rino Anto brought down Bruno Arias. The referee, however, adjudged that the foul was just outside the box. \nBruno himself lined-up to take the free kick but saw ATK goalkeeper Amrinder Singh dive to his left to keep away the curling attempt. \nSix minutes later, Amrinder was called into action again as Reagan Singh's volley from just outside the box was set for the top corner only for the goalkeeper to make a top-notch save. \nAtletico de Kolkata were subdued in the opening session but had a chance in the 41st minute when Jaime Gavilan's corner kick was headed by Ofentse Nato but Cameroon defender Andre Bikey was on hand to turn away the ball for a corner. \nIn the second half, it was Kolkata all the way at the start. In the 49th minute, Gavilan got the better of two players and found Iain Hume unmarked. The Canadian striker crossed for Javi Lara whose shot from handshaking distance shockingly sailed wide. \nIn the 64th minute, Nato's header struck the crossbar with NorthEast goalkeeper TP Reheneesh well beaten. But when Reheneesh was tested again 10 minutes later by Hume, he proved equal to the task. \nCesar Farias introduced Sanju Pradhan and Nicolas Velez in an ambitious double substitution and it worked for the hosts. In the 77th minute, Sanju's shot was initially blocked by Arnab Mondal but the ball fell for Velez who did well to pick the far corner of the net. \nThe goal stunned Atletico de Kolkata and despite their attempts to claw their way back, NorthEast stood firm to run away winners in front of their home crowd. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:03:57.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
