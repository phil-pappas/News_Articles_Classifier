Here are five things Texas A&M fans should know about their opponent:\nFamiliar face returns: The Nevada Wolf Pack attempt to defeat an SEC opponent for the first time in program history as they kick off with No. 17 Texas A&M on Saturday at 11 a.m. Nevada head coach Brian Polian and his squad will get their first look at the remade Kyle Field, but the third year head coach is quite familiar with the Home of the 12th Man.\nIn 2012, Polian patrolled the sidelines of Texas A&M operating as the special teams coordinator and tight ends coach before heading to Reno before the start of the 2013 season.\nLast week No. 20 Arizona defeated Nevada by a score of 44-20. In the contest, the head coach accumulated two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties resulting in a $10,000 fine as well as \"an administration official on the sidelines during games and Polian will be subject to additional reporting requirements\" according to reports.\nDon't be late: Last week against Ball State, Texas A&M quickly jumped out to a 49-3 half time lead before ultimately winning the contest 56-23.\nThe Aggies represent the second consecutive ranked opponent for the Wolf Pack to face this season. A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin and his squad are a perfect 17-0 against non-conference opponents since his arrival in 2012.\nThe Maroon and White have seen the line for the Saturday morning contest dance around the 30 point margin and appear to be heavily favored. Given last week's performance, the high-octane offense and much improved defense from College Station could put the game out of reach early for Polian's Pack.\nWho to watch on offense: Juniors Tyler Stewart and Don Jackson had strong performances last week against Arizona in the 44-20 loss. Stewart completed a career high 18 of his 32 attempts for 159 yards and two scores through the air. After making his debut for the team last season against UNLV, he beat out Dante Mayes and Hunter Fralick.\nIn the rushing game, Jackson leads the way for the Wolf Pack this season, taking 37 attempts for 215 yards and two scores. Checking in at second in the ground attack is sophomore James Butler averaging 49 yards per game.\nWhere to watch: The game is set to be televised on SEC Network, the network of a conference which Nevada has yet to face.\nThe all time record for the series favors A&M 1-0 with the 48-18 victory coming in 1950. At the time the Aggies were a member of the Southwest conference while the Wolf Pack were independent. Nevada also has an 0-2 record against the Missouri Tigers, playing the school in both 2008 and 2009 while a member of the Big 12.\nThe 18 consecutive victories over non-conference opponents for the Aggies are a current FBS best.\nComing home to play: When the Wolf Pack of the Mountain West Conference travel to College Station, it presents an opportunity for a few members of the roster to return home to the Lone Star State.\nAmong the seven Texas natives on the Nevada roster, DFW area athletes include: Senior DT Jeremy Miller of Arlington, sophomore LB Travis Wilson of Cedar Hill, and freshmen Kelton Moore (RB) and EJ Muhammad (DB) out of Arlington and DeSoto.\nFollow Brandon Wheeland on Twitter: @BrandonWheeland\nFor Nevada Game Notes, click here\nFor Nevada season statistics, click here\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["http://www.nevadawolfpack.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/091415aab.html", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/nevada-fines-coach-brian-polian-10000-dollars-2-unsportsmanlike-conduct-penalties-arizona-091515", "http://www.nevadawolfpack.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2015-2016/teamcume.html#TEAM.TEM", "https://twitter.com/brandonwheeland"], "published": "2015-09-17T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:58:32.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
