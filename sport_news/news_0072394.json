At the other end Rovers keeper Lee Nicholls did not have a worthwhile shot to save in the opening 45 minutes.County improved defensively as the game progressed, but rarely threatened. An Izale McLeod shot from 20 yards, deflected narrowly wide on 53 minutes, was the closest they came.Jermaine Easter, whose red card at Mansfield on Saturday was rescinded on appeal, appeared as a second half substitute for Rovers and grazed the crossbar with a 73rd minute shot.In the end a draw was a fair result to a game of few clear openings.
