The 5-foot-9, 180-pound West High senior knew he was going to be even more of a primary offensive player this season and he went through a rigorous training schedule during the spring and summer with coaches at the Elite Training Academy based in Tracy. Dancy pushed his five-game season totals to 1,093 yards and 19 touchdowns after rushing for 105 yards on 13 carries with five touchdowns in last week’s 48-0 win over Bear Creek. Among schools that report stats to MaxPreps, he’s No. 2 in the section and No. 12 statewide in rushing, and tied for third in the section in scoring with McNair’s Derrion Grim, and tied for seventh statewide. Dancy’s biggest game this season was a 31-carry, 389-yard, six-touchdown outing in a 57-42 win last month against Chavez. That performance earned him a Northern California Offensive Player of the Week honor from Cal-Hi Sports. He’s already close to equaling his totals from last season of 1,231 yards and 12 touchdowns. “My mindset has been that this was going to be my final (high school) season and I needed to prepare, to make sure our team can get into the section playoffs,” Dancy said earlier this week. “In the summer I wanted to make sure I hit the gym every day and I worked on every part of my body.” West’s playoff hopes probably won’t hinge on Friday’s visit to Sanguinetti Field when the Wolf Pack (4-1) play Tri-County Athletic League favorite St. Mary’s (3-2). Looking through the rest of the teams in the league, West appears closer to the field than last year’s team that started 5-0 but then went 0-5 in the TCAL. Dancy and the rest of this season’s seniors weren’t subjected to the struggles of two years ago when the Wolf Pack were winless on the field (1-9 counting a forfeit) and lost by such margins as 60-0, 55-3, 75-8 and 55-0. They were primarily kept together to play in more competitive sophomore games. For the team to even be close to a playoff berth would be a solid achievement for Dancy, his teammates, head coach Steve Anastasio and Anastasio’s coaching staff. “The difference is that our team this year is more together than ever before,” Dancy said. “We know who we’re playing this week and it won’t be easy, but we also have to look at it as just another team in front of us. We do want to show everybody this season what West High can do.” It didn’t take long for Dancy to show what he can do last season in his first varsity game against Lathrop. He intercepted a pass near West’s goal line and raced 100 yards for the touchdown. By the end of the season, he already had a workout regimen in place and he stuck to it. “He was going to carry the ball at least 25-plus times per game, so each drill was tailored to strengthen his entire body, from Prowler sled push/pulls (300 pounds) mixed in with heavy bag (100 pounds) lift and carry for 50 yards each direction,” said David Luera, co-CEO of the Elite Training Academy. “We also would work on his balance and change of direction in a drill called ‘The Ring of Fire.’” In the “Ring of Fire,” zig-zagging runs were mixed in with pass catching. He’d begin by catching balls thrown by a Jugs machine at 70 mph from 20 yards away and would move 5 yards closer with increased velocities. “His best day was 90 mph at 10 yards,” Luera said. “Over the summer, we also tweaked Marcel’s start on his 40-yard dash. Most coaches use a hand-held stop watch, but we only use laser timing and Marcel has improved his time to 4.59 in the past year.” “Yeah, I noticed a difference from the first game,” Dancy said. “I was way faster and way stronger. Coach (Anastasio) was going to give me the opportunity and I wanted to make sure it counted.” Dancy also was quick to point out he wasn’t the only one on his team who improved quickness and strength. “Our offensive line returns four of five guys and they were with me working hard every day, too,” he said. “I noticed a big difference with them.” Dancy hopes more college recruiters notice him. With a 3.5 GPA and better-than-solid SAT scores, he said he has visited Sacramento State twice and soon will visit Arizona, San Jose State and Fresno State. No offers have come yet, but a few more big game, especially in the TCAL, could help. “If his team continues to win and make the playoffs, his numbers will be something to talk about at any level,” Luera said. “We’re hoping Division I.” — Contact high school sports contributor Mark Tennis at markjtennis@gmail.com.
