The Chiefs return 14 players from that squad and would love to take the next step and win their first league title this winter. \n\"Hopefully we get to the final again,\" said head coach Derek Tibbatts, whose team opens the season tonight when the Norman Wild visit Shoal Lake at 7:30. \"We have pretty much the same team, great goaltenders, we have some rookies added in there. We should do well. We just have to be consistent and work hard during practices and just have a consistent year.\" \nAmong the Chiefs’ returning players this year are both goalies, Miranda Cook and Emma Greenwood. Cook had the third-lowest goals-against average in the league last season at 1.47 to go with her .921 save percentage. Greenwood had a 2.20 GAA and a .911 save percentage. \nYellowhead also returns some good firepower in five of its top six point leaders from last season. Jalyn Elmes paced the team with 20 points (six goals and 14 assists). She’s back with Hannah Fouillard (nine goals, eight assists), Tatum Amy (seven goals, eight assists), Sam Geekie (10 goals, five assists) and McKenna Paddock (seven goals, seven assists). \nThe Chiefs went 6-2-0 in the pre-season and Tibbatts expects his team to compete with Westman, Central Plains,  Pembina Valley and Winnipeg for the league title this year. \n\"We have lots of speed this year, a lot of scoring. We’re just all-around a good team,\" he said. \n\"We don’t need to lean on anybody. Everybody’s pitching in 110 per cent. Each line contributes so it’s going to be good. We have to rely on everybody to be effective as a team.\" \nMeanwhile, the Wildcats are returning about a dozen players from last year’s squad and hope to make a deep run again this season. \nGuy Williams is back at head coach and said his team lost its focus last season but, if they can maintain a steady mindframe this year, they can have a good season again. \n\"We talked about how we lost sight of the process last year and we’re a good hockey team when we take care of playing the right way,\" he said. \"We let some goals get in our way last year. Goals are good but you have to keep sight of how to get there. That will be the focus this year to make sure we keep playing the game the right way and other things will take care of themselves usually.\" \nThe back end will be the strength of the Wildcats this season with five returning defencemen in Courtney Ganske, Kaitlyn Crowe, Brianna Williams, Shaelyn Vallotton and Tori Williams. Jenna Marshall, who had a 1.97 goals-against average and a .907 save percentage as a bantam-aged player last season, returns in net. Kaitlyn Slator will join her between the pipes. \nFour of Westman’s six scoring leaders from last season are also back in Ashton Bell (15 goals, 22 assists), Jaedon Cooke (11 goals, 15 assists), Ganske (seven goals, 15 assists) and Kenzie Robinson (seven goals, 10 assists). \nThe Wildcats attended tournaments in Swift Current, Sask., St. Cloud, Minn., and Portage la Prairie this pre-season and posted a 1-4-5 record. That doesn’t worry Williams as the team prepares to open the regular season when it hosts Norman in Hartney on Saturday (7:30 p.m.) and Sunday (11 a.m.) \n\"In St. Cloud you play very stiff competition there,\" he said. \"We learned a bit about how to play hockey against bigger, stronger, faster players there. Then last weekend we struggled to finish at times and had a lot of shots on net and made some mistakes and we will rectify that. \n\"Now it’s time to play some real hockey.\" \nICINGS: The MFMHL expands to eight teams this season with the addition of the Interlake Lightning … There are a handful of Westman players on both Pembina Valley and Central Plains. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:25:45.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
