The Indians’ performance Tuesday at Adrian High School took a 180-degree turn and earned them some revenge, as they bounced back to defeat the Maples 26-24, 25-17, 20-25, 25-18 in a Southeastern Conference White Division contest and “Teal Out” match to support and raise funds for ovarian cancer research. “I am so proud of them,” said Tecumseh coach Kim Foley. “Yesterday at practice, we focused on our mental toughness. That was affecting us on Saturday. We were making mistakes and getting down on ourselves, and we weren’t able to bounce back. We played our game tonight.” Back-and-forth momentum was displayed during the majority of the match, and a slow early start put the Maples (42-9-1, 7-3 SEC) in a position to constantly play from behind. “It was a tough match,” Adrian coach Kerry Watkins said. “They (Tecumseh) played very well. They played better than they have against us. We came out a little soft, and that’s hard to dig yourself out of a hole against a team like that. I give all the credit to them. They put us in that position, and it was hard to dig out of it when we’re that equal of teams.” The first set was the most telling of how equal the two teams were, as momentum was continuously traded. Tecumseh (37-4, 7-3) came out firing on all cylinders, as the Maples had some early jitters that were unlike their performance Saturday. Led by a 1-2 punch of setter Megan Freitas and hitter Morgan Skelton, the Indians jumped out to an early 12-5 advantage. “My DS’s (defensive specialists) were huge in this game tonight,” Foley said. “They got it to my setter Megan Freitas, who then got it to my hitters, and we blocked well up front.” Despite a sluggish start, the Maples shook the cobwebs off, and with a couple flicks of the wrist, brought the set’s momentum back to their side of the net. The Maples first tied the match at 16-16, before taking their first lead since scoring the first point of the match, when they jumped ahead 18-17. “If we could have started out the match like that instead of having to come back, then we would have been good,” Watkins said. The finish to the first set was a huge decider in the grand scheme of things, and the Indians were able to fight back to hang on. Adrian led 24-23 and was only one point away from a win, but Tecumseh stormed back with a 3-0 run to seal the set win. Page 2 of 2 - “In the first set, we were swinging at 24-23, and if we make that point, it’s a whole different night,” Watkins said.” The second set was close (25-17), but with another Tecumseh win, the Indians put themselves in good shape to close out the match, leading 2-0. “Everybody did their job, and that led to the win,” Foley said. “When we walked on the court, we didn’t blow this game up. It was just another game. We have four losses this season (two to Adrian and two to Chelsea), so this was a huge obstacle, because there’s a good chance we’ll see them in districts.” Down 2-0 in the match, the Maples weren’t quite ready to give up just yet. Adrian rallied in the third set and earned a 25-20 win to force a fourth set. In the fourth set, the Maples made it tough on Tecumseh once again, but the Indians prevailed to win both the set and the match. Tecumseh had big contributions from Skelton, Tyfanni Bryan and Freitas. Skelton blasted 18 kills and added 18 digs, five blocks and four aces. Bryan totaled 16 kills and five blocks, while Frietas had 24 assists, 15 digs and served 15-for-15. Emily Phelan totaled 24 digs and served 7-for-7 on the night, while Kamryn Powell added 16 digs. Taylor Mareches also contributed nine kills, four blocks and four aces while serving 21-for-21 for the Indians. The Maples were led by Alyssa McKenzie’s 29 assists and a solid night from Madison Hilll, who totaled 12 kills and 12 digs. Jennifer Caris also added eight kills, four aces and two blocks for Adrian.
