Posted: Thursday, October 1, 2015 2:04 pm Game preview: Virginia Tech vs. Pittsburgh Faizan Hasnany, sports editor   0 comments \nThe Virginia Tech football team will begin its Atlantic Coast Conference play this Saturday when the Pittsburgh Panthers come to Lane Stadium. \nThe Hokies have lost five of their last six games against Pitt, however they have won five of the six games played in Lane Stadium since the series started in 1993, with the only loss coming in 2002 when Larry Fitzgerald had three touchdowns for the Panthers. \nA key matchup to watch in this game will be the two star wide receivers for each team. \nJunior Tyler Boyd for Pittsburgh had more than 1100 receiving yards in each of his first two seasons, with a total of 15 receiving touchdowns over that time. In the two games he has played this season, Boyd is averaging over 10 catches and 100 yards per game. \nCovering Boyd will be even more challenging for the Hokies who will be without starting first team All-ACC cornerback Kendall Fuller, who underwent surgery on his right knee on Tuesday which will sideline him for the remainder of the season. \nFor Tech, sophomore receiver Isaiah Ford has been a consistent force on the outside this season, catching 22 passes for 361 yards and three touchdowns. Last season as a freshman, Ford broke Virginia Tech freshman records in both receptions and receiving yards with 56 catches and 709 yards. \nQuarterback Brenden Motley has filled in nicely for Michael Brewer who is still recovering from a broken collarbone suffered against Ohio State in the first game of the season. Motley has thrown for 770 yards and six touchdowns with just two interceptions. The redshirt-junior also has 164 yards and three touchdowns, tying him for the ACC lead in touchdowns with nine. \nAn area of concern for the Hokies this season has been run defense, where they rank 102nd in the FBS, allowing 205 rushing yards per game. They will receive a little help with the expected return of middle linebacker Andrew Motuapuaka, and with Panthers’ running back and reigning ACC player of the year James Conners out for the season with a knee injury. \nFreshman Qadri Ollison is starting for Pittsburgh in place of Conners, however, and doing so very effectively. Ollison has 305 yards on the ground this season with two touchdowns and is averaging 7.4 yards per carry. \nAlthough Pittsburgh intends to start junior quarterback Nate Peterman, don’t be surprised to see plenty of Chad Voytik who started for the Panthers and ran for 118 yards last when the two teams played last season. \nTech got off to a solid start running the football this season but struggled last week against ECU. A bounce-back performance from the Hokies backfield will be crucial this week where bad weather will likely be a factor again, potentially limiting the ability to throw. \nPittsburgh is ranked in the top 25 in sacks, with 3.33 per game; in rush defense, allowing 92.0 yards per game; in total defense, allowing 291.7 yards per game; in pass efficiency defense, with a 103.55 rating; and in third-down conversion defense, at 28.6 percent. Consequently, this matchup could prove to be one of the most challenging matchups that the Hokies’ offense will see this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:12:18.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
