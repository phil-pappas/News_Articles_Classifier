That should change when Texas plays next at Kansas State on Oct. 24. \nThe bye week is expected to provide ample time for junior right guard Kent Perkins and senior wide receiver Daje Johnson to return to the lineup. Perkins left the Oklahoma State game on Sept. 26 with a knee injury and has not played since. \nJohnson left the TCU game on Oct. 6 early in the first quarter after getting hit in the head while trying to make a catch. He didn't return to the game and wasn't able to play against the Sooners. Johnson is Texas' leading wide receiver with 14 catches for 201 yards. true I'm told both Texas WR Daje Johnson, OT Kent Perkins likely to play against KSU in two weeks. â€” Kirk Bohls (@kbohls) October 13, 2015 \nTexas coach Charlie Strong said Monday that he's hopeful both players will be ready to take on Kansas State, which has put together near-upsets of Oklahoma State and TCU in consecutive weeks. The Wildcats play at home Saturday against reeling Oklahoma. \nTexas' first week off after six consecutive games against five ranked opponents to start the season will also give junior defensive tackle Hasaan Ridgeway and sophomore defensive tackle Poona Ford time to heal up from shoulder dings sustained in the Oklahoma game.
