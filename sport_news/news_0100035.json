The right-hander tossed some light pregame passes on the sideline before Saturday’s game. \nWillis, meanwhile, was solid outside of poor a decision late that turned into a pick-six. He was 9 for 9 in the third quarter, and Beaty was pleased with the extra work he did during the week to familiarize himself with the playbook. \n“With each passing day, he gets more and more comfortable,” Beaty said. “I think the challenge for us is to not give him too many things and allow him to still be comfortable with what he’s seeing and what he’s executing so he can play at a little bit of a higher level.” \nAfter re-watching the tape, Beaty said he liked the way Willis was able to be calm in the pocket. \n“Boy, that’s something you really can’t coach. Guys can either sit in there and take it, or they can’t,” Beaty said. “He’s done a nice job of delivering strikes even when he’s getting pressured.” \nWillis, who was KU’s third-string QB four weeks ago, could provide some hope at a position KU has struggled to fill since Todd Reesing graduated in 2009. The Miege product Willis was KU’s top incoming recruit this season, according to Rivals.com. \n“He’s just showing us that the moments are really not too big for him at this point,” Beaty said. “He made some mistakes obviously, because he’s still a young guy, but, man, he made some great throws. He made some plays on extended plays that I thought were impressive.” \nBeaty also sees a player getting through his progressions quicker. Against Tech, Willis was able to better read the defense, find man coverage and deliver the ball quickly to the matchup he liked best. \n“He had some definite growth on Saturday,” Beaty said. “We look forward to him trying to continue to get better. We really think he’ll do nothing but improve.” \nAFTERNOON KICK SET — KU’s Oct. 31 game against Oklahoma will be at 2 or 2:30 p.m. and will be televised on Fox or Fox Sports 1, the Big 12 announced Monday. \nGame 4 of the World Series will be played on that same date and televised on Fox at a to-be-determined time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:37:15.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
