(AP) - No. 18 Michigan says the college career of defensive end Mario Ojemudia is over because of an Achilles tendon injury. \nOjemudia, a senior, was hurt during Saturday’s win at Maryland. \nMichigan plans to put senior Royce Jenkins-Stone in Ojemudia’s spot on Saturday at home against No. 13 Northwestern. \nThe Wolverines won 28-0 against the Terrapins without banged-up running back De’Veon Smith and cornerback Channing Stribling. Smith was hurt in the previous win over then-No. 22 BYU, appearing to injure his right ankle. Stribling’s ailment has not been disclosed. \nHarbaugh expects both Smith and Stribling to practice Monday, and hopes they needed to miss only one game to get healthy enough to play. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:03:42.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
