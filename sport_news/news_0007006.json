Kaneland answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Jacob Marczuk to Tanner Robertsen in the second quarter and then scored on a two-yard run by Jonathan Alstott with 25 seconds left in the first half to take a 14-7 halftime lead. \nKaneland then scored on a 15-yard fumble return by Austin Vickery and got a safety when they recovered a fumble in the end zone. The Knights had three interceptions and two fumble recoveries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:56:09.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
