Minnesota now holds a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series. But unlike previous post-season games, officiating was not a subject of post-game discussion among the players or coaches, nor did it lead to furor among the fans.

Great individual effort on her part.” After splitting the series in the first two games at Minnesota, both teams know the championship is at stake. Consider it a rematch of the 2012 WNBA series when the Fever won the first game at Minnesota and took games three and four at home. This time around, it was the Lynx to break the series tie in the first game at Indiana, putting the Eastern Conference champions on the ropes in a win-or-go-home scenario. To show how evenly matched the teams are, there were eight lead changes and 11 ties during the contest. The last tie occurred when Lynx guard Renee Montgomery took a pass from guard Anna Cruz and then hit a 24-foot jump shot to even the game 77-77 with 1:11 left in the fourth quarter.

[She] and Cruz just play really well together. It was fun to watch and see them be successful.” After Montgomery’s three-pointer, Indiana guard Briann January missed an 18-foot jump shot with 46.9 seconds left, but center Erlana Larkins grabbed the offensive rebound. It kept the Fever’s hopes alive temporarily, as Moore stole the pass and passed to Montgomery who missed a 16-foot jumper with 26.9 second remaining on the clock. Minnesota forward Rebekkah Brunson fouled Indiana forward Tamika Catchings, but since the Lynx had a foul to give, the Fever had to in-bound the ball. It appeared that the game would go into overtime when Fever guard Shenise Johnson missed a 23-foot shot that the Lynx rebounded with only 1.7 second left on the clock. Coming out of the timeout, Minnesota just needed Moore time.

Minnesota guard Lindsay Whalen threw the inbound pass to Moore, who faked Indiana forward Marissa Coleman, took one dribble to clear free of the airborne Coleman, squared her shoulders with the basket, jumped and released the ball from her hand with one-tenth of a second left on the clock. Before the ball made it through the net, the buzzer sounded indicating that time had expired. When it was over, the fans in Bankers Life Fieldhouse were silent and stunned in disbelief. The Lynx players huddled together anxiously to wait for the verdict from the official’s review. It was over and the Lynx took Game 3. Moore’s three-pointer marked the first time that someone hit a shot with under three seconds left in a WNBA Finals contest since Seattle guard Sue Bird hit a foul line jumper with 2.6 seconds left to clinch a 79-77 win over the Atlanta Dream in Game 1 of the 2010 series on Sept. 12, 2010. “It felt good. There’s not much you can do after it leaves your hand until it goes in the rim, other than hope it goes in,” said Moore. “But it felt good coming off my hand. It felt a little off-center, but not so off-center that it couldn’t go in. But I’m just glad it went in.” Catchings knows that Moore is a great player but also concedes that the game could have gone to overtime.

But it’s a team effort. It didn’t come down to just that last shot,” said Catchings. “That’s what you want to see for the Finals. That’s what you want to see representing the WNBA when people tune into the WNBA game and they’re looking at the Finals, you want a great game. You don’t want a blowout on either side.” Prior to the final minute of play, both teams played an even match. Minnesota shot 51.6 percent from the field compared to Indiana’s 50 percent. Minnesota shot 9-for-12 from the free throw line and 7-for-13 from beyond the arc. Indiana shot 9-for-11 from the free throw line and 8-for-17 from three-point range. The Fever held a 32-26 edge in points-in-the-paint and 28-27 margin in rebounds, while the Lynx held a 10-9 lead on second chance points and took a 6-1edge in blocked shots. Minnesota had five players in double-digit scoring led by Moore’s 24 points, and Indiana had four players in double-digit scoring, led by Shenise Johnson’s 17. Fourteen of Johnson’s points were made in the first half. Overall, this was a game for the ages. “First and foremost, I thought it was an unbelievable basketball game,” said Reeve. “I’m a little biased. I think that might be one of the best played WNBA Finals games in our history. I’m pretty mindful of things that have gone on before us, but that one’s got to be up there.” “Those are two teams that really had great offense, and just kind of delivering blows to each other and a little bit of a run, and then their run. We were fortunate to have a chance at the end there to have someone like Maya Moore to step up and hit a really huge shot,” she added. For the Fever, they know that their backs are up against the wall coming into Sunday’s Game 4. In fact, White acknowledges that being down 2-1 in the series does not alter her preparations.

We still have to find different ways that when they get up on us that we can create space offensively. Whether you win or lose, and whether you’re home or away, whether it’s Game 4 or Game 5, or Game 1, I think the way we prepare, and I’m sure the way they prepare, is the same,” said White. Catchings knows that her team has faced this before and what it takes to win. “We’ve been in this situation before, and before we came into this game we talked about it being the best of three series, back to the best of three instead of best of five, so now our back is against the wall again and we have one more game to live. We’ve got to focus on what we need to do to get better,” she said. But in the end, what will matter is not preparation or coaching, but execution. “This is the epitome of what I tell our players of what the Finals are about,” said Reeve. “Coaches are going to spend all their time worrying and strategizing. When it comes down to it, players out there are just playing, and making plays is what it’s all about. I thought this game epitomized it.” \nGame 4 will be held at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis on Sunday with a scheduled 8:30 p.m. ET tip-off. If the Minnesota Lynx win on Sunday, they will be crowned the 2015 WNBA Champions. If the Indiana Fever wins on Sunday, the series reverts back to Minneapolis for a decisive Game 5 on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:33:39.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
