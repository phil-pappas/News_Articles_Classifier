Blue Jays executive Mario Coutinho says the team reserves the right to cut off beer sales after the fifth inning if there are any problems. \nSome Toronto fans reacted to a ruling on a bizarre play in the deciding Game 5 of the Division Series against Texas last week by pelting the field with cans. \nCoutinho says the Blue Jays did an assessment of the situation with police and then talked it over with Major League Baseball.
