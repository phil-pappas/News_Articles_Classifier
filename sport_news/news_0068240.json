And with the women’s college game moving to quarters, having well-conditioned athletes is even more of a priority. \nSo, suffice it to say, Lady Bulldog practices are decidedly different than during Landers’ 36-year run. \n“We’re continuing to add and to build our press defense and offense,” Taylor said. “The first two weeks (of practice) was just a lot of transition, getting up and down the floor. We’re very athletic and it’s important for us to play fast and give ourselves as many chances to score in transition before we allow the defense a chance to get set against us. \n“So starting in the summer, we really picked up the pace, did a lot of conditioning. That has carried over well. Our girls are in great shape, so it’s a lot more up and down than probably what you’re used to seeing in the past.” \nWhile senior center Merritt Hempe commented on an increased dedication to running, sophomore guard Haley Clark was most impressed with a new efficiency at practice. \n“We definitely run a lot more, whether it’s actual sprints or in transition,” said Hempe, who averaged 6.4 points and 4.1 rebounds per game last season. “We’re trying to get up and down the court a lot. A part of that is Joni and a part of that is the game is changing. We have to be ready to play a whole quarter without a break.” \n“Practice is a lot more fast-paced; we get up and down a lot,” added Clark, who averaged 2.1 points and 1.4 rebounds a game. “And we get a lot done in a shorter amount of time. With coach Landers, practice could go for three- to three-and-a-half hours, and I feel we’re getting the same amount in less time because we’re playing faster. That’s probably the big difference. \n“I like it better. Sometimes, days are long and you start to zone out when you get to hour three. This feels more effective.” \nSo when the Lady Bulldogs open the 2015-16 campaign Nov. 15 against Stetson, fans will see perhaps the best-conditioned Georgia team in recent memory. Getting to this point, however, was not terribly entertaining. Taylor’s summer conditioning program was tough, but players hope the payoff will come in the fourth quarter of hard-fought Southeastern Conference games. \n“We have always done 110s on the football field, so we’d do four sets of four and maybe mix in some 220s, like a down and back, and after that we’ll go to the track and run two 400s and two 800s to work on distance,” Hempe said. “And this year we’ve started something new — we’re doing suicides as our court sprints. It used to just be a down and back, but now it’s more a change direction. We learned how to keep the pace up and shortened the times we get to do it in.” \n“It was deadly, but we got through it,” Clark said. “Our trainer (Josh) Rucci tried to incorporate our style of play into our conditioning, so we used to run 300s on the court and now we run suicides. We did that a lot and it was deadly, but it paid off when we got to practice.” \nGeorgia’s ability to scrimmage effectively in the early going hasn’t been a given, as several players — including newcomers Shanea Ambrister (torn meniscus) and Caliya Robinson (torn ACL) — haven’t been able to go “full contact” in practice when they’re able to practice at all. \nAnd the challenge of playing four quarters also looms in the misty future. \n“It’s going to make a big difference,” Taylor said. “I’m excited about it, first of all. I think it’s going to pick up the pace of the game. I think you’re going to see all women’s teams play faster now during the four quarters. I think it’s going to line us up with the professionals. A lot of our kids have aspirations to play either overseas or in the WNBA, and college basketball was the only basketball league that played two halves. This gets us more lined up with professional women’s sports, and that’s the goal for a lot of our girls to do.” \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:09:27.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
