Now, the Houston Astros need him to pitch the game of his life -- while starting on three days' rest for the first time in his career. \nAll of the playoff matchups were set Sunday on a final day of the regular season mostly devoid of drama. The Texas Rangers helped lock in the pairings by routing the Los Angeles Angels to win the A.L. West. \nThe real intrigue begins Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium. That's when the postseason opens with Keuchel and the Astros taking on New York ace Masahiro Tanaka in the A.L. wild-card game. \nOn Wednesday night, 22-game winner Jake Arrieta and the Chicago Cubs -- still trying for their first World Series championship since 1908 -- visit 19-game winner Gerrit Cole and the Pittsburgh Pirates in the N.L. wild-card matchup. \nThe Astros-Yankees winner will play at Kansas City in the best-of-five Division Series on Thursday. The same day, Texas visits Toronto. The Division Series in the N.L. begins Friday with the New York Mets at the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cubs-Pirates winner at St. Louis. Leaders: Miami's Dee Gordon had three hits on the final day of the season to edge Washington's Bryce Harper for the N.L. batting title, and Detroit's Miguel Cabrera won his fourth A.L. championship in five years. Advertisement Baltimore's Chris Davis homered twice to finish with 47 and lead the major leagues for the second time in three years. Toronto's Josh Donaldson topped the A.L. in RBIs (123) and runs (122). Colorado's Nolan Arenado and Harper shared the N.L. home run title at 42. \nThe Dodgers' Zack Greinke won his first N.L. ERA title to go along with the A.L. one he earned with Kansas City in 2009. Greinke's 1.66 ERA was the lowest by a qualifying pitcher since Greg Maddux's 1.63 for Atlanta in 1995. \nThe Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw finished with 301 strikeouts to become the first pitcher to reach 300 since Arizona's Randy Johnson in 2002. Ichiro pitches: Outfielder Ichiro Suzuki hit 88 mph and induced a swing and miss with a breaking pitch during a one-inning relief appearance for the Marlins in their season finale against Philadelphia. \"I can't say it was fun, but I'll never talk bad about a pitcher again,\" Suzuki said through an interpreter while laughing. \nThe 10-time Gold Glove Award winner, who turns 42 on Oct. 22, had never pitched in a major league game. He had pitched in an All-Star Game in Japan. Padres manager: Pat Murphy, who became interim manager in mid-June when Bud Black was fired, will not return as manager, the Padres announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:14:02.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
