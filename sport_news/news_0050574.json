Posted: Thursday, October 22, 2015 11:40 pm VOLLEYBALL: Pioneers sweep Brownstown in sectional opener By MITZI THOMPSON sports@newsandtribune.com News and Tribune \nCHARLESTOWN – Tournament favorite and No. 2-ranked Providence had little trouble getting past Brownstown Central in the first round of the Class 3A Charlestown volleyball sectional Thursday, defeating the Braves 25-23, 25-16, 25-15 in three set. \nWith the win, the 31-3 Pioneers advance to Saturday’s 12:30 p.m. semifinal match against Coach D.J. Zipp’s Scottsburg Warriors, who defeated Salem 3-0 in Thursday’s opener. Silver Creek, the defending sectional champion, will start things off Saturday morning with an 11 a.m. match against Corydon. The winners will play that evening in the 7 p.m. championship. \n“I love our draw,” said Providence coach Terri Purichia, whose teams have won the Class 2A state title the past two years before moving up to 3A this season. “I love that every time we walk into the gym there’s a team on the other side of the net that could beat us. That means we have to play our best and be ready to go every time.” \nThere wasn’t much doubt that the Pioneers came ready to play Thursday, dominating Brownstown through much of the match with their renowned quickness and powerful swings. Each time the Braves got a bout of offense, Providence promptly found an answer. \n“You don’t generally walk out of a sectional match with Brownstown with a 3-0 win, so I have to be pleased about that,” said Purichia. “They are always very well coached. Jennifer (Shade) does a great job of having them ready.” \nThe Braves (14-17) did manage to hang with the Pioneers for the first minutes of each set and kept the score fairly even in the third through 14-14, thanks to a handful of Providence errors and a couple timely kills by Brooke Meyer and Morgan Wehmiller. \nBut Providence regrouped from that point and outscored Brownstown 11-2 to finish the game. \n“We just got really sloppy,” said Purichia, whose Pioneers committed five serving errors, three hitting errors and a couple of net violations to start that third game. “We did a nice job controlling sets one and two, but just got sloppy in number three. There was a lack of concentration. I think they were, at times, trying to be too aggressive and force things that weren’t there instead of trying to control the ball.” \nA decisive double block by Marissa Hornung and Mandy Barney started the roll that finished the match, though, giving the Pioneers the 18-14 lead and all the momentum they needed to shut the door on Brownstown. \nHornung, a sophomore, finished the game with three solo blocks and two assisted as well as a match-high 12 kills, six digs and 10 service points. Jacquie Hornung had nine kills and had a hand on five blocks. Senior libero Audrey Shannon picked up 24 digs for the Pioneers, and junior setter Lexie Libs dished out 24 assists and had 13 service points. \n“Defensively we’re a pretty fluid unit, and I felt like tonight there was a lot of stop and go,” said Purichia. “A little too much thinking about what you’re doing rather than just reacting and doing. I hope that improves by Saturday. They were just a little bit nervous. It doesn’t matter how many matches you’ve won up to this point. Now, if you lose you go home, and there’s pressure when it comes to that point.” \nBrownstown’s net offense was led by Meyer, a junior, who put down eight kills. Leah Stidham, the junior libero, dug up 10 Pioneer hits, and junior setter Richayla Huff handed out 18 assists. \nCLASS 3A CHARLESTOWN SECTIONAL \nPROVIDENCE 3, BROWNSTOWN CENTRAL 0 \nProvidence 25 25 25", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:20:34.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
