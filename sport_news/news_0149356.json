They’re the top three in total offense and passing offense.\nThey’re also the next three opponents on Iowa State’s schedule:\nAt Texas Tech Saturday, at home against TCU, and then at Baylor.\nThat’s second-ranked TCU and third-ranked Baylor, by the way.\nDES MOINES REGISTER\nPeterson: Cyclones entering the world of 'made-for-TV football'\n“You’re talking about outstanding football programs,” Cyclones coach Paul Rhoads said during Monday's weekly session with reporters. “You’re talking about a Texas Tech football team that started extremely fast, then ran into the second and third-ranked team in the country.\n“We’re on the verge of doing that ourselves; they just beat us to it.”\nAdding to the sack total\nThat probably won’t happen, but it won’t be the fault of an Iowa State defense with 14 sacks, the second most in the Big 12.\nTexas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes gets rid of the ball so quickly that he has been sacked just once in five games.\n“Opponents have only got there once, because he gets the ball out of his hands fast,” Rhoads said. “To only be sacked one time tells you about what kind of player he is, and what kind of offense thy run.”\nThat doesn’t mean the Cyclones won’t even try, however.\n“We have to let him know we’re there — at least cause his feet to shuffle a bit and maybe cause him to hold onto the ball a little longer.”\nBuy Photo Iowa State's Sam Richardson tries to avoid the tackle of Kansas defensive end Dorance Armstrong, Jr. during their game at Jack Trice Stadium in Ames on Saturday, October 3, 2015. (Photo: Brian Powers/The Register)\nMore Richardson wins?\nQuarterback Sam Richardson finally broke through as a winner while starting a Big 12 game, Saturday’s 38-13 handling of Kansas ending his 14-game conference starting drought.\nHow might that translate to the future?\n“We’re very pleased with how Sam’s running our offense, and what he’s given us,” Rhoads said. “The win will give him added confidence. He’ll play a little lighter from here on out as far as being able to move around, because of the burden that’s been lifted off his shoulders.”\nMahomes will play\nTexas Tech’s quarterback completed 32 of 50 passes for 415 yards in last Saturday’s 63-35 loss against third-ranked Baylor, and he did it despite a sore knee.\n“He's getting treatment every day, and he told me it feels a lot better, so hopefully by this week he can be 100 percent,” coach Kliff Kingsbury told reporters Monday.\nKingsbury said Mahomes will start on Saturday, which isn’t exactly a surprise to Rhoads.\n“He’s got great poise and great composure,” Rhoads said. “Coach Kingsbury does an excellent job with quarterbacks.”\nHe leads the Big 12 with an average of 367.2 passing yards a game. He has thrown 14 touchdowns passes against just five interceptions.\nDES MOINES REGISTER\nISU holder's celebrations steal the limelight\nDefending Tech starts with ISU’s offense\nThere’s a fine line between ball control and scoring, Rhoads said.\n“We don’t want to compromise flow just to accomplish one goal,” he said when asked about the importance of keeping the Red Raiders’ offense sidelined.\n“The goal is to score points on offense, and in the process of doing that, score more than your opponent.”\nThe burgeoning freshman running back opens up a lot of opportunities for Iowa State's offense Randy Peterson\nWarren right, Warren left, Warren up the middle\nTexas Tech is the most prolific passing team in college football. The Red Raiders’ Patrick Mahomes is one of the nation’s top quarterbacks.\nSo how does 2-2 Iowa State expect to win Saturday’s 2:30 p.m. game in Lubbock?\nRush the football.\nTailback Mike Warren and the offensive line will be running against a defense that’s allowing 277.4 yards a game, the worst in the Big 12.\n“We have to continue to work to run the football,” coach Paul Rhoads said at his weekly press conference Monday. “How much Mike’s a part of that could change by game (or) it could change during the course of a game.\n“Mike’s going to be very active.”\nDES MOINES REGISTER\nIowa State's Warren: 'They're probably going to be coming for me'\nCyclone sports columnist Randy Peterson has been reporting on ISU during the past five decades.
