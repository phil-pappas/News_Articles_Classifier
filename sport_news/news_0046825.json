At some point in time this individual pulls a gun on the other — not uncommon in Philadelphia, unfortunately.\"\nStudents walk past police after being locked down at the Community College of Philadelphia Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2015, in Philadelphia.

Officers were still searching the campus for the weapon, he said.\nRamsey said prosecutors would decide later what charges would be filed, but they could include firearms violations, assault and perhaps terroristic threats.\nIt was unclear whether the suspect was a student.\nAdvertisement \"I was kind of freaked out at first not really knowing what to do,\" Lisa LeCain, a student at the college, told the Associated Press by email. \"But people around me were pretty calm, and I figured that as long as I would stay where I was until I'd know what to do, I'd be kind of safe.\"\nLeCain said she didn't feel her life was in danger, but she \"got scared ... when I learned they apprehended to suspect in the building where I was.\"\nStudents walk after being locked down at the Community College of Philadelphia Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2015, in Philadelphia.
