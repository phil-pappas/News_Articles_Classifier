A senior MC official said after issuing a show-cause notice to the firm, a report had been submitted to MC Chief Engineer Mukesh Anand in connection with the scam. Mehak Enterprises and an MC employee are allegedly involved in the scam. Earlier, the MC Chief Engineer had ordered a probe into the scam. The Public Health Department of the MC had allotted tenders of various toilet blocks in Sectors 17, 21 and 26 to Mehak Enterprises in 2012 for around Rs 700 per month per toilet block with a 10 per cent annual hike. Sources said the firm sublet these toilet blocks to Shyam Lal, an employee of the office of the Medical Officer, Health (MOH), of the MC, which was against the terms and conditions of the contract. According to MC rules, an MC employee cannot run toilet blocks on his or his family memberâ€™s name. The sources said the MC was receiving payments for these toilet blocks from a bank account in the name of MC employee Shyam Lal instead of the bank account of the firm. Recently, MC officials received a complaint in this regard following which the MC Chief Engineer had ordered an inquiry into the matter. Action recommended against MOH employee The MC Engineering Department, which looks after the toilet blocks in the city, has recommended to the MOH to issue a notice to employee Shyam Lal, who was allegedly running these toilet blocks instead of the firm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:15:33.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
