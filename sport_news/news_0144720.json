(Photo: Journal file) CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLast month, Tori Jarosz anxiously awaited word from the NCAA during a lengthy appeals process as she attempted to gain another year of college basketball eligibility. At the time, she didn’t know if she would be on a team. \nNow, the Marist College standout is on a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference first team. The MAAC announced its basketball preseason teams and rankings during a ceremony on Wednesday. \nSixth-year senior Jarosz and senior Sydney Coffey were the Red Foxes named to the women's first team. Marist men's basketball point guard Khallid Hart was named to the second team. \nJarosz was granted a medical hardship waiver in September, giving her an additional year of eligibility. The 6-foot-3 center averaged 17.1 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game last season. Marist coach Brian Giorgis called Jarosz “the best big person in the league last year.” Coffey, a wing, averaged 12.6 points and shot 37.5 percent from three-point range last season. \nMarist was picked to finish second in the conference, behind Fairfield. It marks the first time the Red Foxes weren’t tabbed the favorite since 2007. \n“We’ve got a lot more different things to worry about this year, being really young and inexperienced,” Giorgis said. \nThe Red Foxes were topped by Quinnipiac in the MAAC final last season, ending a run of nine consecutive titles. They endured a rocky offseason. On April 2, just weeks after a loss in the WNIT, four players informed the school and team they would transfer after the spring semester. In July, incoming freshman point guard Jordyn Jossart suffered what is expected to be a season-ending knee injury. \nHart averaged 14.7 points last season. The Red Foxes men, who went 7-25 last year, were picked to finish 10th out of 11 teams. \n“We’re going to build from the ground up,” Marist coach Mike Maker said. “There’s no quick fix with transfers or any of that.” Read or Share this story: http://pojonews.co/1LMYNVu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:59:42.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
