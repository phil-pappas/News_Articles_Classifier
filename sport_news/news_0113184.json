He gave up five runs and nine hits, while striking out seven and walking two. \n\"I don't think I had any really bad pitch selection,\" Cashner said. \"It was four ground balls and I did what I really wanted to do. But that kind of sums up the season, the way it has been.\" \nCashner finished the season with career highs in games (31), innings pitched (184 2-3) and strikeouts (165). \n\"It is something to build off of,\" Cashner said. \"I made every start this year and took the ball every day. My slider is definitely improved and that is going to be a big pitch for me.\" \nMilwaukee starter Zach Davies (3-2) pitched seven innings in his sixth major league start. He struck out six and walked two. \n\"It's awesome,\" Davies said. \"It happens, but I was just making sure I was going deeper into games later on here toward the end. It was good getting deep into six and seven innings.\" \nHernan Perez and Martin Maldonado each drove in two runs in the Brewers' five-run sixth. Perez and Maldonado had two hits apiece in the game. \n\"It was a move-the-line type of inning,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. \"We just kept moving the line. We hit a lot of hard ground balls through the infield, and we had some good at-bats in that inning.\" \nPadres outfielder Justin Upton left the game in the first inning after crashing into the wall while fielding a ground ball near the third base line. Upton remained on the ground following the collision and was helped off the field. \n\"He was checked out and everything looks fine,\" Padres interim manager Pat Murphy said. \"Nothing major. A neck strain. I don't know how sore he is going to be tomorrow.\" \nSan Diego has lost three straight and four of five, and was shut out for the 19th time this season. \n\"It's been a tough September,\" Murphy said. \"The times we had opportunities we didn't get the big hit.\" \nThe shutout is the seventh of the season for Milwaukee, which has won five of seven. \nPadres catcher Rocky Gale collected his first major-league hit, a single in the seventh. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nPadres: OF Matt Kemp (finger) will need 4-to-6 weeks to recover from a right middle finger strain and will not play again this season. \nUP NEXT \nBrewers: RHP Taylor Jungmann (9-7, 3.64) lost his last start in St. Louis after allowing six runs in five innings. He has not won a start since Sept. 3 against Pittsburgh. \nPadres: RHP Ian Kennedy (8-15, 4.38) takes the mound for San Diego following an outing in which he allowed four runs over five innings to San Francisco but did not factor in the decision. Kennedy has lost four straight. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:09:29.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
