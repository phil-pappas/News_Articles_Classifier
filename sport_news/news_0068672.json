SALT LAKE CITY, UT - OCTOBER 10: Running back Trey Watson #5 of the California Golden Bears runs in for a fourth quarter touchdown against the Utah Utes at Rice-Eccles Stadium on October 10, 2015 in Salt Lake City, Utah.

(Photo by Gene Sweeney Jr/Getty Images) ( Gene Sweeney Jr. ) \nCal turned the ball over six times, five coming on interceptions by Goff, who hadn't thrown more than two in a game since his debut as a freshman in the 2013 opener. \"Probably the worst game of my life,\" he called it. \nBut Goff, who drew a week's worth of national media buildup, also showed what all the fuss is about. He passed for 340 yards and two touchdowns, including a perfect 35-yarder with touch to Trevor Davis. \nAnd he drove the Bears from their own 5-yard line to the Utah 21 before Boobie Hobbs stepped in front of Darius Powe to bat away a fourth-down pass in the final minute. \nGoff suggested that the narrow defeat on a night where he was so mistake-prone shows how well his teammates played. \"I don't think the defense and everyone else around me gets enough credit,\" he said. Advertisement \n\"The defense certainly bailed the offense out the first half for sure,\" coach Sonny Dykes said, alluding to the Bears' five first-half giveaways. \nThe defense survived the first three turnovers -- allowing just a field goal -- but ultimately wore down against Utah running back Devontae Booker, who rushed for 222 yards and two touchdowns. \nReceiver Stephen Anderson conceded that the game was a missed opportunity. \n\"We got kind of wide-eyed. We just had too many mistakes,\" he said. \"Our defense played great, gave the offense more than enough opportunities to win the game.\" \nDykes said the week off probably comes at a good time for the Bears, who need to mend physically. The extra time should heal their emotions, too. \n\"I think we're going to respond better than ever,\" Goff said in a near-defiant tone. \"This is going to end up in the long run being a good thing for us, something we can learn from. We understand we can't turn the ball over that many times if we want to be a good team.\" \nSafety Stefan McClure said the defense is demonstrating its will to fight from start to finish after two seasons where the Bears were often helpless to stop an opponent. \nHe added that no one in the Cal locker room has any concerns about Goff. \n\"I'd still pick him of all the quarterbacks in the Pac-12,\" McClure said. \"I'm excited to see what he's going to do next Thursday on ESPN again. He's going to be ready to go.\" For more on Cal sports, see the Bear Talk blog at ibabuzz.com/beartalk .
