(John Sleezer/Kansas City Star/TNS via Getty Images) HOUSTON, Texas (AP) - \nDallas Keuchel remained perfect at home with seven gutsy innings and Chris Carter homered Sunday, leading the Houston Astros to a 4-2 win over the Kansas City Royals to take a 2-1 lead in the American League Division Series. \nThe Astros could wrap up the best-of-five series with a win over the defending AL champions in Game 4 on Monday. \nKeuchel (2-0) worked out of jam after jam, allowing five hits and one run with seven strikeouts after going 15-0 at home this season, a modern major league record. \nLuke Gregerson gave up a leadoff homer in the ninth to Alex Gordon before finishing off the Astros first playoff game in Houston in 10 years with a four-out save. It was save of more than three outs in three years. \nJason Castro drove in two runs with a single in the fifth that made it 2-1. Carlos Gomez, who has a rib muscle strain, started for the first time in the series and had an RBI single in the sixth. \nCopyright 2015, Schurz Communications", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:43:20.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
