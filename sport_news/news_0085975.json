The Caps will have the veteran Waston available — if they want — for tonight's game against the same team in Frisco, Texas. Photograph by: DARRYL DYCK , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nFRISCO, Texas — There has been some interesting developments today in the Vancouver Whitecaps roster situation ahead of tonight's crucial Major League Soccer matchup against FC Dallas (6 p.m., PT, on TSN, TSN 1040). \nBoth centre back Kendall Waston and young Canadian midfielder Marco Bustos have flown into Texas today after playing in international friendlies last night in New Jersey and Washington, D.C., respectively. \nWaston, the 6-5 dominator in the middle of defence for the Caps, played the full 90 minutes for Costa Rica in that country's 1-0 win over the U.S., an American loss that has turned up the heat on coach Jurgen Klinsmann. Bustos came off the bench for the final 19 minutes of Canada's 1-1 draw with Ghana. \nThe fact they're in Texas means head coach Carl Robinson is at least considering playing them. \nBustos is the more probable, given that he was only on the pitch for those 19 minutes and the fact the Caps are very thin at the No. 10, or attacking midfielder, position. Pedro Morales (hamstring), Nico Mezquida (hamstring) and Mauro Rosales (abductor strain) are all unavailable. \nWinger Kekuta Manneh played centrally a couple of weeks ago at San Jose and may well start there again tonight. But Robinson said at the airport on Monday, when he believed Bustos might start or play at least 45 minutes on Tuesday, that the youngster would have played tonight if he was available. \nWell, now he is. So does Robinson start him, or go with Manneh? \nThe 19-year-old, Winnipeg-raised Bustos had a strong second half of the season with the Caps’ second team — WFC2 — and has been itching for a chance with the first team. He's creative, has great vision and could help a Caps' offence that has been struggling to get traction in the last few games. \nWaston's situation is a bit more dicey. The Caps’ regular-season finale isn't until Sunday, Oct. 25, and Waston won't be making next week's trip to Tegucigalpa for the CONCACAF Champions League game, so it's not a case of wearing the big man out. But does Robinson risk potential injury by playing Waston on back-to-back nights? \n\"He'll probably tell me he's fine,\" Robinson said Monday when asked what he'd do if Waston did play Tuesday and then made it to Dallas. \"If I play him and it helps us get a result, then it's a great decision. \"If I play him and he picks up an injury then you'll probably call me crazy and say 'What are you doing?’ ” \nThe Caps currently sit third in the West, one point back of Dallas and Los Angeles, and can finish anywhere from first to fifth. The top two teams earn a first-round bye; third and fourth play host in a single-game knockout round. \nA loss in Dallas tonight won't kill the Caps, but earning a single point and then taking three from eighth-place Houston in that finale at BC Place Stadium could still land them in second place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:40:27.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
