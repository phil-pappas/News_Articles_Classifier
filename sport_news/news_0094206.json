Defensively Brentford handled us well.\" \nOf the boos at half and full time, Jackett said: \"It is fair enough. The fans encouraged us tonight, they stuck with it, I'm thankful for that. Their reaction is justified with that performance and that result. \n\"Their passing was sharper. I didn't think we were closing down well enough. \n\"Brentford set off at a good tempo, played very well, passed the ball very well, and we didn't get to their tempo. \n\"Middlesbrough and Birmingham (Wolves' next two opponents) are both going well, it's a huge challenge to us and we have to rise to it. \n\"We need to bring our fans into play with good performances, we didn't do that tonight. We were very flat. What do you think? Log in and start commenting \n\"I'm confident we can regain our form. We needed a bit of inspiration at 1-0 down, something to fall for us, perhaps one good quality ball, we didn't have our usual quality or final ball. I was disappointed with that.\" \nDominic Iorfa is suspended for Saturday's visit of Middlesbrough after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season.
