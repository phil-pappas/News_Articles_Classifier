But now he faces the challenge of running a team, in addition to his duties as offensive coordinator. He said Sunday that tight ends coach John Dunn would help him with gameplanning and some play-calling, and he said Wednesday that the rest of the staff has embraced the situation, though some are going to have to \"double dip\" moving forward. \n\"I haven't gotten a lot of sleep, but I wasn't getting a lot of sleep before then because we didn't score a lot of points,\" Locksley said. \"That was normal for me.\" \nLocksley met with the Terps on Tuesday and he talked about Edsall's firing and turning the page. He compared it to losing a parent, and he said he talked to them about the different degrees of responsibility that they might feel after Sunday. It was a traumatic experience for the program that they will have to work through. \n\"We've got to just do a great job as a staff communicating with them, making sure that they're in touch with the emotions,\" Locksley said. \"As I told them, I feel like crap because I know I played a part in this decision that was made on Sunday with not getting the job done on the offensive side of the ball and we should. A good coach lost his job.\" \nThe road ahead for Maryland under Locksley is an uphill battle, even to reach bowl eligibility. But there were signs of life against Ohio State last weekend before Edsall's ouster. It starts a week from Saturday with a tilt against Penn State in Baltimore. Then it's a visit to Iowa. Then a home game against Wisconsin. There are six more games to be played, and Locksley wants the players to enjoy it. Then, the results might come. \n\"More than anything, it's just a matter of the mindset and the psyche of coming out with the idea that this is a great opportunity, this thing should be fun as you come out on the field, it shouldn't be a grind,\" Locksley said. \"We're going to try to make the next six weeks as much fun as we can make it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:18:57.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
