The Italian founded Scuderia Ferrari, literally Ferrari Stable, in 1929 to help drivers in racing their cars. Enzo's second and sole living son, Piero, will retain a 10 percent stake after Wednesday's share listing of 9 percent of the company's share capital. Parent Fiat Chrysler will see its stake reduced to around 80 percent following the flotation which could value Ferrari at just shy of $10 billion.
