(AP) - Beach Boys vocalist Bruce Johnston says memories of owning a Ford Ranchero when he learned to surf just might have influenced his vote in a Mississippi vintage car contest.\nJohnston, Beach Boys co-founder Mike Love, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant and Biloxi Mayor Andrew \"FoFo\" Gilich were among judges for \"Best Cruiser on the Beach.\"\nThe Sun Herald ( http://bit.ly/1LelNsJ ) reports that a 1957 Ranchero owned by Dan Crossley of Lafayette, Louisiana, won Saturday's contest. Johnston joked, \"Out of 20, I gave it a 30, but I'm not biased.\"\nIt was part of the eight-day \"Cruisin' the Coast\" festival along U.S. 90 in Mississippi.\nThe Mississippi Press ( http://bit.ly/1LHQTPd ) reports that 7,639 people had registered by Saturday, almost 350 above last year's record.\nNext year's festival will be the 20th.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
