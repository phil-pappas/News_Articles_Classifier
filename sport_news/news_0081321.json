He played a single game at second for Seattle. “We truly like the way he is swinging the bat, that is why we are putting him in there. We hope he does some damage offensively, we get a lead and likely go a small bit extra defensively.’’\nDue to the fact Mets center fielder Yoenis Cespedes misplayed his fly to deep center, Ackley went 1-for-three with a triple. He was removed for Stephen Drew in the sixth.\nBrendan Ryan and Rob Refsynder also saw time at second base in Saturday’s win.\nGeneral manager Brian Cashman and Girardi lauded struggling lefty Chasen Shreve before Saturday’s game and one day after the reliever had an additional rocky outing. Nonetheless, Cahsman hinted Shreve’s current struggles may force the manager to back off the left-hander.\nAsked who amongst the substantial cast of relievers residing in the bullpen other than Dellin Betances, Andrew Miller and Justin Wilson, Girardi came to Shreve’s defense.\n“I still have a lot of belief in Shreve. I know he has had his struggles lately, but this guy has pitched seriously effectively for us this year,’’ Girardi said. “Look at his body of operate, not necessarily a snap shot of time. Of course, he is significant to us and we will need his innings. He is our guy and we think he will turn it about.’’\nShreve’s complete 2015 backs up Girardi’s request to view the entire canvas rather of the current struggles. In 55 appearances Shreve is six-two with a two.67 ERA, has permitted 42 hits in 57 ¹/₃ innings and struck out 64 whilst walking 30. But in his previous seven games Shreve has an 8.11 ERA, has provided up nine hits (3 homers) and seven walks in six ²/₃ innings.\n“I am not concerned about his well being, clearly he is pitching in a poor stretch suitable now,’’ Cashman mentioned. “Shreve is 1 of the reasons we got this far but Joe could have to get in touch with a various name till we resuscitate [Shreve].’’\nNo matter how a lot of times Girardi is asked about employing Alex Rodriguez at a position other than DH, the manager has the very same answer wrapped in a distinct paper: It is not taking place.\n“Going into spring training we stated we needed his offense the most,’’ Girardi stated. “Let’s not neglect he is 40 years old and operating him out there for defense there likely is not going to be a ton of variety. And it’s anything he is not comfortable undertaking.’’\nEven though the Yankees had Rodriguez take ground balls ahead of late August games in Atlanta and early September games in Boston at 1st base, it in no way got further than that.\n“It didn’t appear correct so we decided not to do it,’’ Girardi said. “He does not appear comfortable.’’\nRodriguez walked as a pinch-hitter Friday evening and flied to center Saturday in the very same role.\nBetances worked a great eighth, striking out two. It was his 37th straight road outing with out allowing an earned run. He has 42 ²/₃ innings in the streak that dates to final Aug. 28. The streak is tied for third with Mariano Rivera for the third longest.\nBeginning with Wilson’s strike out of David Wright in the sixth, Wilson, Caleb Cotham and Betances fanned seven straight Mets. The string ended when Cespedes grounded out for the final out in the eighth.\nThe Yankees have homered in 12 of the previous 13 games.\n ", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/09/19/girardi-goes-with-an-interesting-option-at-second-to-jolt-yanks/"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:07:12.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
