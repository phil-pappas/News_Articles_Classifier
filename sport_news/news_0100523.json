Phillip, Associated Press) 179 CONNECT 19 TWEET LINKEDIN 83 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Sparty statue was safe, guarded as usual by the Spartan Marching Band during the week of the Michigan State-Michigan football game. \nBut elsewhere on the MSU campus early today, unknown vandals spray-painted a block M and \"Beat State\" in U-M colors on the Magic Johnson statue at the Breslin Center. \n\"There's a lot of great Michigan kids,\" Spartans coach Tom Izzo said from Big Ten basketball media day in Chicago. \"There's some idiots. And there's some idiots on our side, too, that do crazy things. \n\"Messing with Sparty is a bad thing, like messing with their 'M' is a bad thing. But messing with Magic, that's a worse thing. And we'll make sure that from now on maybe the basketball team will sleep out. ... But we'll have him covered from now on.\" \nCleaning the bronze statue was expected to take most of the day and cost thousands of dollars. \n\"If suspects are identified, they will face criminal charges,\" university spokesman Jason Cody said. \nWhat they said \nMichigan State basketball coaches and players were asked during today's Big Ten basketball media day in Rosemont, Ill., for their thoughts on the Earvin (Magic) Johnson statue outside the Breslin Center being vandalized: \nMSU men's basketball coach Tom Izzo: \"There's a lot of great Michigan kids. There's some idiots. And there's some idiots on our side, too, that do crazy things. But messing with Sparty is a bad thing, like messing with their 'M' is a bad thing. But messing with Magic, that's a worse thing. And we'll make sure that from now on maybe the basketball team will sleep out. I know the band does and different people. But we'll have him covered from now on. But I don't look at that as the university, I look at that as a couple people defacing something that, the only problem I have with Magic's thing, even more than Sparty for me, is Magic gave so much to the game of basketball and sports and people and our state of Michigan. Michigan fans, Michigan State fans, he's one of the few guys who transcended all those things. And I know it's a gimmick and it's something but like I said, it'll give me a good reason to keep our guys intact next year, because they'll all be sleeping around that statue next year.\" \nMSU women's basketball coach Suzy Merchant: \"I just think that there's different places you can do that at to express yourself. It's pretty upsetting, that's an iconic figure in not only Michigan State history but in the history of the game of basketball. And he's done so much for so many people. There's a different way you can express your enthusiasm for the Michigan-Michigan State rivalry. It was upsetting. I saw that and I just, I felt my blood pressure go up. I was like, 'I want to play! Let me call one play!'\" \nMSU senior guard Denzel Valentine: \"That's a new one for Michigan. The Sparty statue was well-guarded so they hit the next statue over. But we'll be classy about it, we'll let our game do the talking Saturday and come out with the win. â€¦ I mean, it's all fun and games. It's just gonna make it a little bit better once we beat them Saturday. It's gonna be a little bit better, a little bit more satisfaction.\" \nMSU senior forward Matt Costello: \"It is what it is. I mean, it's gonna happen. College kids are always trying to do something funny like that. But it doesn't reflect on everybody, all the Michigan fans. I don't hold that against them, just like I hope they don't hold it against us when we've done something against them. It is what it is. We've got a game on Saturday, let fans do what they want to do.\" \nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @joerexrode .
