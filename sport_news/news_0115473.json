Springfield High school senior, Nick Amlin says,\n\"It would take weeks to get your project back it was extremely time consuming.\" This 20 year old kiln was to blame.\nNick family owns Amlin Auction Services, so when he spotted a newer kiln at an auction, he decided to act and call Mr. Abel Sean Abel tells 13 abc,\n\"We are of course in a budget crisis, which we are working out of, but I said Nick there's no way we can do it.\"\nKiln's are not cheap. They can cost hundreds of dollars. Nick says, \"I got a bidder number anyway.\"\nHe decided to bid on the kiln with the money he earns as a DJ.\n250 bucks later, Springfield High school had a new kiln. Mr. Abel says, \"He's a high school kid getting ready for college he has better things to spend his money on but he got it in his head and he said were going to donate it. Nick is very Springfield proud\"\nThis spacious kiln belongs to Springfield's ceramic class.
