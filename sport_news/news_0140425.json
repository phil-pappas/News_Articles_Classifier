The rest of Saturday’s Atlantic Coast Conference football game against Wake Forest showed the Wolfpack enter a shell of that form, which was more reminiscent of the previous two games that were ACC losses. The Wolfpack held steady for a 35-17 victory at BB&T Field, using a four-touchdown cushion to engage cruise control for the last three quarters against what appeared to be an overwhelmed Wake Forest team. “I think we had some plays there in the second quarter too, we just didn’t execute as well,” N.C. State coach Dave Doeren said. “We need to get better on offense in the second quarter. Offense has to adjust better.” While the Wolfpack (5-2 overall, 1-2 ACC) exorcised the demons of six straight losses in this venue — not having won here since Philip Rivers was the quarterback (in 2001) — the vexing aspect for N.C. State was its offense after the opening barrage. N.C. State scored on the third, first, first and fourth plays of possessions in the first quarter. The Wolfpack had the ball for a combined 2:45 on those possessions, and held the ball for 4:19 on the only drive it didn’t score. “We know we had to come out aggressive on this team, just execute our plays, got in the red zone and scored. Got up 28, we’ve just gotta keep pushing,” said freshman receiver Maurice Trowell, whose 59-yard catch and run on the third play of the game set the early tone. The Wolfpack’s next offensive play was an 85-yard touchdown run by Matt Dayes, who had 205 yards on 16 carries. The junior had 172 of those yards on 11 first-half carries. Brissett later connected with Nyheim Hines on a 58-yard pass, and Dayes busted loose again for a 57-yard touchdown run. After that Dayes touchdown in the last minute of the first quarter, the Wolfpack had 322 yards of offense. It compiled 153 yards across the last three quarters. “A lot of those from the first quarter on really fell on me, missing throws, making bad reads in the run game and things like that,” Brissett said. “Just things to clean up and just learn from it and be ready next week (for Clemson).” What didn’t waver was the Wolfpack’s defense, which held the Demon Deacons (3-5, 1-4) to 196 yards of offense until a 75-yard drive that ended with quarterback Kendall Hinton’s second rushing touchdown of the game with 44 seconds left. Page 2 of 2 - The Wolfpack recorded seven sacks, three of which came from senior Mike Rose on third downs. Freshman Darian Roseboro, listed as Rose’s backup on the depth chart, had two sacks. “The young boys on the D-line were going. They said the old man wouldn’t get no sacks, so I had to prove them wrong,” Rose said. Perhaps the biggest offensive gaffe for N.C. State came on a first down from Wake Forest’s 12-yard line early in the fourth quarter. The play was a swing pass to Jaylen Samuels that lost a yard. On the same side of the field that Samuels was stuffed, Trowell lined up without a defender in front of him, ran into the back of the end zone and jumped up and down with his hands raised. Brissett never looked his way. “Yeah man, but the play wasn’t set up for me to get the ball, it was really set up for the tight end,” Trowell said. “Just try to get Jacoby’s attention, if he just looked my way. The sideline was screaming at him, but he couldn’t hear it.” N.C. State ended any chance of a crazy comeback with Bra’Lon Cherry’s 52-yard punt return touchdown with 4:30 left. That marked the first time an opponent has had a punt return touchdown against senior Alex Kinal, Wake Forest’s most prolific punter in school history, since the 2012 season — his freshman year. ■ EXTRA POINTS …: John Wolford started at quarterback for Wake Forest, but exited after five empty possessions, four of which were three-and-outs. … N.C.
