That's probably the direction it's heading.\"\nCharles was making a cut deep in Bears territory when he hurt his right knee in the third quarter of Sunday's loss to Chicago. His right knee buckled at a gruesome angle.\nThe four-time Pro Bowl selection needed help from a trainer and linebacker Justin Houston to get off the field, never once putting any weight on his right leg.\nCharles tore the ACL in his other knee four years ago, missing most of the season.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) and the Associated Press.
