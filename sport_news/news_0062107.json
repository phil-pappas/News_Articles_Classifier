(Wade Spees/postandcourier.com) MOUNT PLEASANT — On senior night, the College of Charleston men’s soccer team upset No. 22 Hofstra, 1-0, on Saturday night at Patriots Point. A header off of Hamilton Carlin in the 18th minute helped secure Ralph Lundy’s 300th career victory at the College of Charleston in his 29th season as head coach. “This win feels great because it puts us in a great position in the conference standings,” said Lundy. “If we keep playing like this, we will be playing at home in November. Hofstra was 5-0 in the conference and ranked in the top 25 so getting a victory over them is what I’m truly happy about. “I am so blessed to have been at the College of Charleston and have all these great players over the years. I love College of Charleston and this win means a lot to me.” In the first half, neither team got into much of an offensive rhythm with only five total shots between both teams. The Cougars (6-5-2, 3-1-1 CAA) made one of their three first-half shots count in the 18th minute. Senior midfielder Adam Purvis, who missed the last month due to injury, returned to the starting lineup and played a ball from the left side of the box. Junior forward Hamilton Carlin maneuvered around the Hofstra defense and headed his second goal of the season. Overall, in 40 seasons as a head soccer coach, Lundy has compiled a 431-306-54 overall record. He currently ranks fifth among active division I men’s soccer coaches in wins (431). Redshirt senior Kyle Murphy scored the game’s lone goal with just 51 seconds left in regulation to give Clemson a 1-0 victory on the road at Syracuse. Redshirt junior keeper Andrew Tarbell added four saves in the victory. The fourth-ranked Tigers improved to 11-1-2 overall, and 4-1-1 in the ACC, while the No. 16 Orange fell to 9-4-1, 2-3-1. Charleston Southern’s home winning streak ended at four matches as the women’s team fell to Longwood, 2-0, in Big South Conference play. Amanda Spencer scored both goals for the Lancers in the match as CSU struggled to find momentum in their third contest over the last four games. Jazmin Gonzalez recorded seven saves in goal for the Buccaneers (6-6-2, 3-4) in the loss. Volleyball Addison Kaderli recorded six of her team-high 18 kills in the fifth set to pace visiting Charleston Southern past Radford, 3-2 (17-25, 25-20, 22-25, 25-21, 15-8). The Buccaneers rode the momentum built up in the fourth set as CSU recorded the final three points of the frame in building an 8-3 lead at the crossover in the fifth set. Radford was unable to pull within four points the rest of the way as Kaderli put in the final four CSU kills in the set, including the game-winner. Four Buccaneers were in double-digits in the kills category as CSU (6-17, 1-5) picked up its first Big South win of the season. Katrina Houston finished the match with 17 kills, while Connor Malone (11) and Meredith Parrott (11) were also in double-digits in the match. Tennis College of Charelston senior Zach Lewis, junior Vasiliy Kichigin, and sophomore Juan Estavarena, each won two singles matches on the first day of competition Friday at the ITA Regional in Cary, N.C., to advance to the round of 32. The Cougars went 8-3 on the first day of competition with five different players picking up at least one victory. Lewis defeated Robert Lingren of Elon, 6-3, 6-0, in the round of 128, and Jake Munns of Furman, 6-3, 7-5, in the round of 64. Senior Charlie Ghriskey defeated Brent Lett of Clemson 6-1, 7-5 in the round of 128 but fell in the round of 64.
