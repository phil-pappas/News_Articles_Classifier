More Headlines \nThe 1-3 Dolphins are coming off a 27-14 loss to the New York Jets on Sunday in London. \nPhilbin thanked team owner Stephen Ross, the players and coaches and Dolphins fans. \n\"This is a tremendous organization from top to bottom that has a talented and dedicated staff,\" Philbin said. \"I want to especially thank the players, coaches and football staff who have worked so unselfishly and represented the team with dignity and class. \n\"I would be remiss if I didn't thank the incredible fan base who has supported me and my family unconditionally since day one,\" he added. \nPhilbin met with Ross on Sunday and said he was confident that he still would be the coach when Miami plays the Titans in Tennessee on Oct. 18. The Dolphins have a bye this week. \nBut a disappointed Ross believed the team was not progressing fast enough, and that the season still could be salvaged. \n\"This was a tough decision for me to make knowing how tirelessly Joe worked in his four years here to make this a winning team. He is a man of the highest character and integrity that I developed a close personal relationship with,\" Ross said. \nDolphins tight ends coach Dan Campbell has been named interim coach and he will remain in that position throughout the season. \nPhilbin compiled a 24-28 in Miami since taking over in 2012. He is the first head coach in the NFL to lose his job this season.
