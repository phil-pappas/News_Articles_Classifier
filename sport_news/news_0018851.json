After a scary incident Tuesday, Lamar Odom’s life reportedly lies in the hands of Khloe Kardashian\nAdChoices The former NBA player remains in a coma in a Nevada hospital after being found unconscious at a Las Vegas-area brothel Tuesday night. In a bizarre twist, however, TMZ Sports reports that Kardashian legally is in charge of Odom’s medical decisions as long as he’s in a coma.\nOdom married Kardashian in September 2009, but the couple filed for divorce in December 2013. According to TMZ Sports, though, Odom and Kardashian waited until last July to sign the official documents, and the divorce won’t become final for at least two months due to an “extreme backlog in the family law courts.”\nThe “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” star arrived at the hospital shortly after Odom was admitted Tuesday night, TMZ Sports reports, and apparently already has made several of Odom’s medical decisions.\nAccording to reports, Odom arrived at the brothel on Saturday and partied for several days while taking a number of different drugs, including an herbal substance as a substitute for Viagra.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/14/lamar-odom-khloe-kardashian-still-married-making-medical-decisions/", "http://nesn.com/2015/10/lamar-odom-fighting-for-life-after-being-found-unconscious-at-brothel/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:25:03.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
