And now that free agency was approaching, he didn’t want to leave. \nHe loved the fans and the organization and the city, and as confetti fell that day, there was no place else Tate wanted to be. \n“Actually, after the Super Bowl, I was so confident I was coming back, I was showing up to the facility, just never cleaned my locker out, left all my stuff in there,” Tate told the Free Press last week. “I thought, ‘I’m going to be back. I know.’” \nFor most of February 2014, Tate was in and out of the Seahawks’ Renton headquarters. He hung out with the team’s equipment guys, had multiple conversations with the affable Carroll and traded text messages with Schneider “way more than I had during the season.” \nThe tenor of the conversations always was the same, with Carroll and Schneider telling Tate how much they appreciated him and wanted him back, and both sides vowing to make it happen. \nSeattle Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate celebrates after an NFC divisional playoff NFL football game against the New Orleans Saints in Seattle, Saturday, Jan. 11, 2014.

He invited his sisters for a spring-break trip that happened to coincide with free agency, never expecting he’d be making travel plans of his own. \nBut business is business in the NFL, and when contract talks with the Seahawks fizzled, Tate found himself suddenly boarding a flight to Detroit, where a five-year contract and a new beginning awaited. \n“My emotions, I didn’t know what to feel,” Tate said. “I thought for so long, ‘I’m going to be a Seattle Seahawk the rest of my life. I’ve done everything I possibly can.’ And it didn’t work out, unfortunately. They had just paid Percy Harvin, so they had a large sum of money invested in him, and I wasn’t looking for $60 million like he was. It just didn’t work.” \nThings didn’t work for Tate and the Seahawks collectively. Lions at Seahawks: Scouting report, prediction \nBut separately, as Tate prepares for his return to Seattle on Monday for the Lions’ prime-time showdown with the Seahawks on Monday Night Football, no one can complain. \nThe Lions got what turned out to be the steal of free agency in Tate, who caught 99 passes last year to lead the team to the playoffs. \nThe Seahawks used the money they saved on Tate to help sign Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas to contract extensions last spring, then made their second straight trip to the Super Bowl. \nTate posted career numbers in his first season with the Lions (99 catches, 1,331 yards) and has settled in nicely to his new home. \n“I’m thrilled for him,” Carroll said in a teleconference with Detroit reporters last week. “I’m thrilled for our guys. To me, he’s one of our guys. That’s just the way I look at it. Our guys watch our players that are in other places and we enjoy just seeing how they do. We don’t want them to do it against us, of course, but we love to see them have success in other places.” \nThe Detroit Lions Golden Tate warms up before preseason action against the Buffalo Bills on Thursday, September3, 2015 at Ford Field in Detroit.

As a 6- or 7-year-old, he prayed every night that he would be a professional athlete. And he spent his days growing up in Nashville, Tenn., playing football, baseball, basketball, hockey or whatever other game he could find in the neighborhood streets. \nIf not an athlete, Tate said he wanted to be a police officer growing up. Or a professional fisherman. \nSome of his fondest memories as a youth are the Fridays he had in kindergarten and first grade, when his parents picked him up from school with a Happy Meal from McDonald’s and drove straight to Percy Priest Lake or Old Hickory Lake. \n“With fishing poles hanging out of our Jeep and tackle boxes and the worms and crickets,” Tate said. “Going to catch bluegill and perch and bass and catfish, just used to love it, man. It was family time. You didn’t have cell phones then, all you had was each other.” \nTate traveled the South playing AAU baseball as a youth, with his grandmother usually in the driver’s seat and two coolers packed with sandwich meat and yogurt and Gatorade by his side. \nHe was drafted twice as an outfielder — in the 42nd round by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2007 and in the 50th round by the San Francisco Giants in 2010 — but gravitated more toward football, the sport that his father, Golden Tate II, starred in at Tennessee State. \nA running back in high school, Tate started two games at receiver as a freshman at Notre Dame and blossomed at the position the next two years. He left school after his 93-catch, 1,496-yard junior season, and the Seahawks made him a second-round pick in their illustrious 2010 draft class that included Russell Okung, Kam Chancellor and Thomas. \nTate played sparingly as a rookie in a move that he now says was the best thing that could have happened to his career. He knew little about running proper routes then, and less about taking care of his body and how to go about football in a professional way. \nDetroit Lions receiver Golden Tate, pictured, and Linebacker Stephen Tulloch host the Lions annual charity softball game at King Boring Field in Dearborn on Friday, June 5, 2015.

Mitchell, DFP) \n“My first season in college I only caught (six) passes, and so my second and third year were my seasons,” Tate said. “I thought I had it figured out, but little did I know. Looking back at it, you got to thank Coach Carroll, because who knows if he rushes me into that situation of being a starter or being the guy, who knows mentally (how I would have handled it). I don’t think it would have, but mentally that could have screwed me up for the rest of my career, me doubting myself. \n“But because they didn’t put the pressure on me, they were patient with me, it let my learning process be natural. When I was ready, I think we all reaped the benefits of it.” \nTate led the Seahawks with 64 catches for 898 yards during their Super Bowl season of 2013, but he was largely considered a complementary player on a team that relied heavily on its defense and running game. \nBeyond the money — the Lions offered “significantly” more in free agency than the Seahawks, and Tate acknowledged that “if the deal was that close in numbers, I would have stayed in Seattle” — Tate said he was attracted to the Lions in part by the chance to play alongside Calvin Johnson and Matthew Stafford on an up-and-coming team in a pass-friendly offense. \nOf course, Johnson missed three games and parts of two others with ankle injuries last year, Stafford has thrown 18 interceptions in his last 20 games, and the Lions are off to an 0-3 start and have the NFL’s 27th-ranked offense. \n“I’ve never been 0-3,” he said. “And I think this is the most talent we’ve had here in a long time, and this is one of the most talented teams I’ve been on in my career. And I want to win. I could have gone to one of these very, very bad teams and had nothing at all and got paid a lot of money, but I wanted to come here because I see a bright future. I see all the pieces that we need to win.” \nDetroit Lions wide receiver Golden Tate (15) celebrates after the NFL football game against the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley Stadium, London, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2014.

I could have. But it is what it is. That’s what life is. It’s choices you make. \n“I don’t look back. I’m still excited about where I am and love where I am and the long-term future of this organization. But you can’t help but to be like, ‘Damn.’” Our latest Lions podcast with punter Sam Martin \nLast week, Tate made headlines by saying on his weekly radio show on WMGC-FM (105.1) that opposing defensive players have told him after every game this year they knew what plays the Lions were calling. \nMany took those comments as a shot at offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi, but Tate said that wasn’t the case. He said he still believes in Lombardi and the offense. \n“I think we all just need to be a little bit better,” he said. \nThat starts Monday night in Seattle, where the Lions will try to turn their season around against one of the best defenses in the NFL. \nChancellor and Thomas, Tate’s draftmates from 2010, still are patrolling the Seahawks’ secondary, and Sherman is so good that he usually shuts down whatever receiver he’s covering. \nTate said he and Sherman used to have epic battles in practice, and he’s ready for those memories and others to flood back when he steps on CenturyLink Field. \n“I’m going to try my best to keep my emotions under wraps and use my emotions to help our team, not draw negative attention, or any more negative publicity,” Tate said. \nDetroit Lions wide receiver Golden Tate (15) runs out during player introductions for the Lions' NFL football game against the Denver Broncos, Sunday, Sept. 27, 2015, in Detroit. (Photo: Rick Osentoski, Associated Press) \nCoach Jim Caldwell said he’s not worried about that with Tate, who teammates describe as the ultimate competitor. \n“There’s emotion there. It brings back memories. So these guys are human. They’re not inhuman. They’re not robots,” Caldwell said. “So they do feel it and they do sense it, but I think they’re pros, too. And so I do think that they can manage and they can handle the stress and the excitement and all of those things that kind of go along with it.” \nTate, second on the Lions with 15 catches for 161 yards, is plenty excited for Monday night's game. But there’s no stress or nervousness. At 0-3 and with a chance to help save the Lions’ season, there’s no time for that. \n“Obviously, I want to win this game, and I tried not to worry about this game until the week got here,” Tate said. “But you can’t help but to think, ‘It’s my old team, man. Guys who drafted me, everyone who helped me get to here.’ This is a chance for me to go out there in that stadium and handle business. That’ll be great for us to do.” \nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.
