Tye elevated on a ball from freshman quarterback Davarius Turner, took it away from a Big Red defender and went 78 yards for what proved to be the game-winning score in a 22-18 win over Hughes Saturday afternoon at Glenn Sample Field. \n“We didn’t throw the ball very much today,” said Western Hills coach Jason Sparks. “I think we threw it three times, had one interception and one touchdown. That play (Tye’s TD catch), we thought it was gonna be one-on-one coverage and it ended up being, so we took a shot and Juwan made a play for us. He’s made plays all year for us.” \nAfter taking the lead, the Mustangs’ defense recovered a fumble and the offense drained the clock dry with senior running back Anton Kirby, who Sparks called a heck of a player. \n“We faced a ton of adversity, both teams did, both teams were slugging it out,” Sparks said. “I’m proud of how our guys took a punch and gave punches back. Very proud of our effort … to win on senior night is huge, they’ve given a lot to the program for four years; they deserve it.” \nHughes went up 18-16 when sophomore quarterback Edmond Taylor found his 6-foot-4 wide receiver, Mohlil Mecheau, for a 19-yard touchdown midway through the third quarter. \nWest High’s defense forced two turnovers and a turnover on downs in the second half to help the Mustangs (2-6) close out the Big Red (3-5). \n“Everything we did today was set up by our defense,” said Sparks, “they lived on the field and they didn’t quit. For them out there living on the field, they’d give up a big play then come back and get a pick or force a fumble. They played really well.” \nTurner turned a fumble recovery from his defense into a 39-yard touchdown run to start the scoring in the first quarter. Turner hit Tye for a successful two-point conversion to put the Mustangs ahead, 8-0. \nOn its third offensive possession, Hughes overcame multiple penalties, converted third-and-20 and fourth-and-10 to find the end zone on a 20-yard pass from Taylor to Mecheau. Hughes failed the first of all three of its two-point conversion attempts. \nHughes junior Tony Buckley snagged an interception in his own red zone to squash a West High drive. But a bad Big Red snap punting from their end zone gave the Mustangs a safety and a 10-6 lead. \nThe Big Red defense got in on the action when junior Juwann Blair scooped up his own forced fumble and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown to give his team a 12-10 lead in the second quarter. \nA shanked punt set West High up deep in Hughes territory and the Mustangs’ freshman signal caller added another rushing touchdown from 13 yards out to give West High a 16-12 lead at intermission. \n\"You gotta give credit to West High,\" said Hughes coach Matt Thompson. \"Their coaches had the guys ready to play and they executed. Unfortunately for us, we didn’t quite execute the things we wanted to. We did some great things, drove the ball more than we have in the last couple weeks. We just couldn’t finish it. I am proud of the way our guys fought; we have no quit in us - that’s one thing I love about this team.\" \nThompson said the Big Red will go back to work in preparation to host Aiken Thursday night. The Mustangs look to string together two wins in the Southern Ohio Public League with a trip to Shroder Saturday night. \nHughes 6-6-6-0 – 18 \nW – Turner 39 run (Tye pass from Turner) \nH – Mecheau 20 pass from Taylor (run failed) \nW – Team safety \nH – Blair 60 fumble recovery (run failed) \nW – Turner 13 run (run failed) \nH – Mecheau 19 pass from Taylor (run failed) \nW – Tye 78 pass from Turner (pass failed) \nRecords: W 2-6, H 3-5 3 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1LAJhvQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:04:24.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
