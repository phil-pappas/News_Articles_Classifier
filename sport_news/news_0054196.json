This prevents the clubs from getting wet and/or dirty. It also provides a place to hold an umbrella and cigarettes or cigars. In addition, it eases divot repair and ball marking. Overall, it promotes convenience.\nThe original design was submitted to the Racine office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
