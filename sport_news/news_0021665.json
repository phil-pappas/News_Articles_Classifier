(AP Photo/Michael Probst) \nMOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany — After taking criticism from United States coach Jurgen Klinsmann, Fabian Johnson helped Borussia Moenchengladbach to a 5-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday. \nJohnson played the full game and hit the post in the second half as 'Gladbach made it four league wins from four games under interim coach Andre Schubert. Schubert took over from Lucien Favre, who quit after starting with five losses. \nKlinsmann had openly criticized Johnson for taking himself off in extra time of the Unites States' 3-2 loss to Mexico in their Confederations Cup playoff last Saturday. \nThe American right back complained of a thigh problem and came off in the 111th minute of the playoff, seven minutes before Paul Aguilar scored Mexico's winner. \nKlinsmann told Johnson to return to Germany a day before the U.S. played Costa Rica in an exhibition, when he said \"he can rethink his approach about his team.\" \nKlinsmann's stance was subsequently criticized by Schubert, who said the U.S. coach had a \"responsibility\" to take the player off. \n\"When a player feels a tightening of their thigh in added time in a game and could then be on the verge of a more serious injury, I only think it's the responsibility of the team and himself to have him subbed off,\" Schubert said on Thursday. \nJohnson plays in a midfield role for 'Gladbach. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:01:45.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
