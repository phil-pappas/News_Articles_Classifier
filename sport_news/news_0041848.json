Yes, it was close, 28-22, in favor of the Falcons. But Matt Johnson and Roger Lewis are just too much of a QB-WR tandem for an average team like the Bulls.\nFor the first time this season Johnson was out-gunned at quarterback, with UB's Joe Licata passing for 348 yards to Johnson's 324. Even with the BG offensive line giving up four sacks, and the inclement weather, the Falcons were never in serious trouble, despite two late Buffalo scores. The bigger issue is allowing 500 yards of total offense. Against a better team, that's a problem.\nNorthern Illinois at Central Michigan -- CMU has been the one team that historically causes the Huskies the most problems. The spotlight shines bright now, however, because this 29-19 NIU loss comes early in the MAC season. Also of concern, the Huskies blew a 10-3 halftime lead in just one quarter, falling behind 23-13 by the end of the third and never challenged again. That said, Central Michigan is for real and Cooper Rush might be the best quarterback in the MAC not named Matt Johnson.\nOhio University at Akron -- Consider Ohio's 14-12 victory a program win, as the game was statistically a wash overall with the difference being Akron never could crack the end zone, getting four Robert Stein field goals instead, while the Bobcats took advantage of the two early scoring opportunities as QB Derrius Vick generated a pair of touchdowns.\nThe Zips seemed to have a \"take what they give you\" game plan, making a lot of passes, instead of taking what they wanted, which is running the football behind a senior-dominated offensive line. In the end, that might have cost them.\nMiami at Kent State -- The first order of business for a building program is \"beat the teams you are supposed to beat.\" In that regard, KSU's 20-14 triumph over Miami was a success, anchored by three interceptions. Two came from sophomore defensive back Demetrius Monday , who now has five on the season.\nBut the infamous fourth quarter 'prevent defense' which every fan knows ... prevents defense ... allowed Miami to roll up some late passing numbers and get back into a game they should not have been in. Hopefully, lesson learned because the next two weeks -- at Toledo and vs. Bowling Green -- will require four quarters of defense to even be close.\nToledo at Ball State -- The now No. 24-ranked and undefeated Rockets are one of just two MAC teams that won a MAC road game (Ohio) over the weekend, easily 24-10, and they have been winning while short-handed on offense as tailback Kareem Hunt , a junior from Willoughby South High, has been sidelined with a hamstring issue for the last two weeks.\nThe defense, however, is downright ornery, allowing just 13 points a game. The next three weeks -- Kent State, Eastern Michigan, UMass -- look to be a mild tuneup for a very tough stretch run the last four games of the season against all of the top contenders in both divisions.", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/531455/cooper-rush", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/552745/kareem-hunt", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/513573/matt-johnson", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/195/ohio-bobcats", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/550249/demetrius-monday", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/519697/robert-stein", "http://www.mac-sports.com/index.aspx?path=football&", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/513614/joe-licata"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:09:51.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
