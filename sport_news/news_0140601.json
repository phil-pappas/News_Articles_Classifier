The son of Tapit drilled a four-furlong bullet in 47 seconds at New York's Greentree Training Center, his final major piece of preparation for the $5 million Classic at Keeneland.\n\"Frosted has done very well since winning the Pennsylvania Derby,\" McLaughlin said earlier this weeek on an NTRA teleconference. \"He just seems to be getting better with each race and each day of training.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nHonor Code, Frosted tune up for Breeders' Cup\nEarlier this year a winner in the TwinSpires.com Wood Memorial before running fourth in the Kentucky Derby, Frosted also finished second in the Belmont Stakes as well as Saratoga's Jim Dandy before meeting American Pharoah in the Aug. 29 Travers.\nWith Jose Lezcano aboard -- regular jockey Joel Rosario was injured earlier on the card -- the colt pushed the Triple Crown winner on the lead before both faded, letting Keen Ice by late. By Sept. 19, Frosted was back at Parx Racing, dominating the Pennsylvania Derby.\n\"Frosted is just, you know, he just is like a throwback horse,\" McLaughlin said. \"He just doesn't miss a note. He stomps around and wants to strike the hot walker in the morning. He's happy. He never seems to get tired. The more we do with him the better he does.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nFrosted much the best in Pennsylvania Derby\nMcLaughlin said his brother Neil, who has conditioned Frosted at Greentree, joked he wouldn't be able to keep the colt on the ground for six weeks between starts this time. The Godolphin Racing-owned 3-year-old has posted a trio of works on the all-weather track leading into the Classic, which featured 10 pre-entries and draws post positions Monday.\n\"It's a tough, tough race with American Pharoah, and Beholder, Honor Code, Tonalist; Keen Ice beat us already,\" McLaughlin said. \"So it's a great group of horses, but we feel like we're up for a big race ourselves.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f5fd5a38ef886ac2726b60b019276cc559e28348/c=612-0-3044-2432/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Louisville/Louisville/635802654123716694-Honor-Code-May-31-credit-Susie-Raisher17.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/902281f4c3e9e8862a5b73a8ee7026c28be4e5a7/c=300-0-2700-2400/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Louisville/Louisville/635781809976321051-Frosted-credit-Adam-Mooshian.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:05:50.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
