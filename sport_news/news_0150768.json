BUTLER Olean Times Herald Olean Times Herald | 0 comments \nST. BONAVENTURE — For the last several months, the talk among St. Bonaventure basketball fans has centered on a celebrated returning trio. \nIt’s been highlighted by concern about an already suspect frontcourt that was made even thinner by the loss of their team’s tallest player a month ago. \nIt’s been punctuated by the same excitement over the possibilities and the usual worry over the question marks that always seem to be present throughout a Bona basketball offseason. \nNow, though, the focus can actually shift to just that … basketball. Now, many of those questions will start being answered. \nFor the first time since dropping a hard-fought game with Dayton in the Atlantic 10 Tournament last March, the Bonnies will take the court publicly Saturday morning, kicking off the 2015-16 season with the annual “Select-Your-Seat” open practice in the Reilly Center. \nAs part of the event, fans can watch the Bona men practice from 10 a.m.-1 p.m. and select available seats for season tickets in the process. \nBEGINNING WITH the official start of practice earlier this week, the Bonnies are looking to build on a year in which they won 18 games for a second consecutive season, won the second-most conference contests in program history (10) and earned the No. 7 seed (of 14 teams) in the A-10 Tournament before bowing to the Flyers in the quarterfinals. \nThe start to the current campaign has a decidedly different undertone to it than some of the ones before it, however. \nUnlike the last three years, when the scoring department was left mostly bare by the graduated seniors, Bona returns three of its top five scorers — and most consistent overall player — from 2014-15, including top point-getter Marcus Posley (16.7 points), second-leading scorer (13.5 points) and rebounder (7 boards) Dion Wright and point guard Jaylen Adams (10 points, 4.5 assists), back healthy after missing the final nine games of last season with a hand injury. \nUnlike the last three years, however, Bona has a massive hole at one particular spot on the floor — in the frontcourt — where it now has only a pair of 6-foot-7 players (Wright and junior Denzel Gregg) and two untested freshmen following the graduation losses of all-conference center Youssou Ndoye and reserve Chris Dees and the offseason wrist injury to 6-foot-10 Jordan Tyson, who was going to be counted on to anchor the middle this winter. \nHEADING INTO the preseason, the Bonnies will have to find a way to maximize their production in the backcourt, which includes juco swingman Courtney Stockard, sophomore “glue guy” Idris Taqqee and prized Canadian recruit Nelson Kaputo, while offsetting its shortcomings in the frontcourt. \nAnd everyone will likely get his chance to contribute. \nA year ago, Bona was expected to have the deepest team it’s ever had under Schmidt, who enters his ninth year at the program with a record of 124-123. This year, though, as the result of Tyson’s injury and the fact it has two four-year transfers sitting out, Bona has just nine eligible scholarship players, making for the shortest bench Schmidt has had in his tenure. \nAS FAR AS how a smaller-than-usual (for the last seven years, Bona had either Andrew Nicholson or Ndoye on which to rely in the post), faster and more perimeter-oriented style works for the Bonnies, that remains to be seen. \nMany of those questions, however, will begin to be answered starting tomorrow morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:57:43.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
