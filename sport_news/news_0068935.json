(Source: Alabama Athletics) \n(RNN) – We may have seen the play of the year. \nOne thing I hate is when someone hypes \"the play of the year\" and you watch the highlight and it's just a receiver making a catch you've seen about 100 previous times. It was a great catch, but it was no greater than the dozens of other great catches we see every year. \nBut I'm not talking about anything like that. I'm talking about a botched punt in the final seconds recovered by the defense and run in for a touchdown as time expired, turning a seemingly two-point loss into a four-point win. \nThat was No. 7 Michigan State topping No. 12 Michigan in dramatic fashion. For all of Auburn's magic a couple of years ago, not even they pulled out something like that. \nNot only was it a total reversal of fortune at the final whistle, but the player who scored the touchdown dislocated his hip diving into the end zone, a Michigan TV station thought the Wolverines actually won and it literally gave a fan a heart attack . \nIt was the coup de grace capping off a week full of notable non-offensive touchdowns, which are discussed in further detail below. \nThere was no other drama in the non-SEC top 25. (No. 21 Boise State lost to Utah State 52-26, but all other losses were to teams with higher rankings.) But true to form, the SEC was full of it. \nAnd, oh by the way, Kansas City took a 2-0 lead over Toronto in the ALCS and the Mets opened the NLCS with a win over the Cubs. You probably didn't notice because Major League Baseball likes to have its most important series compete with football for some reason. 1 \nHere's a look at what we learned from watching SEC games in Week 7. \n1. Offense is overrated. Alabama ran three interceptions back for touchdowns, LSU's eventual game-winning touchdown came on a fake field goal and the teams they beat both had punt return touchdowns at important times. \nMississippi State recovered a blocked punt at the 2 and ran an interception back for a score and Georgia and Missouri combined for no touchdowns of any kind. Defensive stops also played a huge role, including a fourth down sack by Auburn to seal its first conference win. \nAt a time when offense gets all the headlines and games that end with scores like 70-63 are considered the greatest things we've ever seen, defense continues to make a difference in who has a chance to win a championship and who doesn't. \nTurnovers are usually the deciding factor. In the seven games SEC teams were involved in this week, only one saw the team with more turnovers win. (LSU had one to Florida's none). It doesn't matter what style of football is played. Neither a slow, plodding running game nor a fast, no-huddle spread will be effective if the defense is there to stop it. \n2. Les Miles did what Les Miles does. No. 6 LSU is the best team in the SEC at this point and beat No. 8 Florida, the only other SEC team without a major flaw, 35-28. \nThe Tigers can run, stop the run, throw when they need to, protect the football and most importantly have Les Miles to turn the unthinkable into the inexplicable. The only thing LSU doesn't do well is avoid penalties. The Tigers (6-0, 4-0) are last in the SEC and 87th nationally in penalty yards per game, but had that under control against Florida. 2 \nMiles is at his best against the Gators (6-1, 4-1). In 2007, LSU converted five fourth downs in a 28-24 win. In 2010, a fake field goal when down by three with less than a minute to play resulted in a backward pass to the kicker that bounced before he picked it up and converted a first down. LSU won 33-29 with a touchdown in the final seconds. In 2011, a fake punt on fourth and 15 resulted in a 52-yard touchdown run by punter Brad Wing. The touchdown was disallowed when Wing celebrated early, but LSU won 41-11. Last year, a 50-yard field goal with three seconds left lifted the Tigers 30-27. \nThen there was Saturday. Tied at 28 with 11 minutes to play, kicker Trent Domingue fielded a throw, bobbled it for about five yards and scored a 16-yard touchdown. It ended up being the game-winner. \nYou can’t compete with that. \n3. Alabama remembered who it is. Derrick Henry carried 32 times for 236 yards, the No. 10 Tide intercepted four passes - three of which were pick-sixes - held No. 9 Texas A&M to 32 yards rushing and won 41-23. \nIt was Alabama at its best. Henry has set a career-high in carries in each of Alabama's last three games and he has scored a touchdown in every game this season. Alabama (6-1, 3-1) wins when it doesn't beat itself. In the past, that has come from special teams miscues and the passing game. \nSaturday, the most notable plays from quarterback Jacob Coker were two tough runs where he lowered his shoulder and absorbed hits from defenders. That's not just old school football, that's how Alabama wins. \nThere was a hiccup in the third quarter when the Tide fumbled on special teams, had some ill-timed penalties and settled for a couple of field goals, but the Aggies (5-1, 2-1) were never in danger of taking the lead. If you think defense is overstated, consider this: Alabama scored 21 points on interception returns and won the game by 18. \n4. Ole Miss needs a running game (WARNING: Statistical analysis). Things have turned sour for the Rebels ever since they climbed to the No. 3 ranking four weeks ago. How bad is it? Well, the team that's been on the rise ever since Hugh Freeze was named coach has fans upset with Hugh Freeze. \nThe No. 13 Rebels (5-2, 2-1) lost 37-24 to Memphis (6-0) and only had 40 yards rushing. Ole Miss is 71st nationally and eighth in the SEC in rushing, but that is misleading. Ole Miss' schedule is frontloaded with inferior non-conference opponents. \nTheir 167-yard per game average is padded by 338 yards against Tennessee-Martin, 215 yards against Fresno State (107th at defending the run) and 265 yards against New Mexico State (126th, second-worst, against the run). \nHowever, their other four opponents are all in the top 25 at stopping the run. Against Alabama (third), the Rebels had 92 yards. Florida (25th) held Ole Miss to 69 yards on the ground. Memphis (24th) limited the Rebels to 40 yards, and they gained 151 on the ground against Vanderbilt (23rd). Ole Miss has two more games against top tier rushing defenses - Arkansas (15th) and LSU (eighth). \nWithout the ability to back down the pass rush and pick up short yardage when it's needed, any team of reasonable quality the Rebels encounter can exploit their pass-heavy offense. That passing game is No. 10 nationally, but it's just as vulnerable as any one-dimensional offense. \n5. The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party is back to its old self. Georgia got exactly what it needed with a 9-6 win over Missouri and the Florida loss to LSU. Both teams are off next week before meeting in their annual \"party\" that they no longer like being associated with alcohol. \nWith Florida struggling in recent years, some of the game's former glory had gotten tarnished, but the Gators still proved it's a hurdle that has to be cleared with an 18-point win last year and a loss by only three two years earlier. \nThis year, it's Georgia (5-2, 3-2) that has made the game look less than stellar. After losses to Alabama and Tennessee, the Bulldogs had to beat Missouri to stay relevant in the SEC East race. They did and now with the Gators' loss to LSU, the Cocktail Party winner can be penciled in to the SEC championship game. \nEach team will still have two conference games remaining - Vanderbilt and South Carolina for Florida and Kentucky and Auburn for Georgia - but each should be wins. \nIf Georgia wins, it's in the driver's seat for the SEC championship and would only have to win out to clinch the SEC East. \nFlorida could clinch the SEC championship berth with a win, if Kentucky and Tennessee have each suffered a loss. (Kentucky plays Mississippi State next week while Tennessee faces Alabama. They play each other the same day as Florida-Georgia.) \nNo matter what, Florida and Georgia will be playing with their SEC championship hopes on the line, just like they're supposed to. \n6. Never trust Kentucky. A win over Auburn was just as important for the Wildcats to make a bowl as it was for Auburn (more on this in a minute). But a 30-27 loss has them eyeing Vanderbilt and Charlotte as their ticket to the postseason. \nAn upset over Mississippi State or Tennessee is not out of the question, but if Kentucky (4-2, 2-2) can't handle Auburn's attempt at a coherent offense and general lack of defense, there's not much to suggest those are legitimate expectations. \nBasketball season starts the day before the game against Vanderbilt and the No. 1 Wildcats will play Duke three days afterward, so it's possible no one cares anyway. \n7. Corey Fatony did it again. I talked about this a little more in depth last week , but punter Corey Fatony is still the best part of Missouri's team. \nMissouri (4-3, 1-3) has no offense. The Tigers are 98th nationally in passing yards, 121st in rushing, 125th (third to last) in total offense and tied for 124th (also third to last) in scoring. \nTheir punter, however, is in the top 25 in yards per punt average and leads the SEC in punting yards. He's had plenty of practice. He has six more punts and 260 more yards than anyone else in the SEC. And, of course, he outpunted his offense again. \nIn fact, Missouri's offense was outpunted by both punters in its loss to Georgia, and Fatony outpunted both teams. The Tigers had 164 yards of offense and Fatony punted for 320 yards, nearly doubling the offense for second consecutive week. (Georgia's offense had 298 yards.) Georgia's Collin Barber also outpunted the Tigers with 180 yards. \n8. Dak Prescott is a one-man show. Prescott is 28th nationally in total offense and second in the SEC only to Ole Miss' Chad Kelly. That's actually a step down from where he had been last year. \nHe was the whole show in a 45-20 win over Louisiana Tech, passing for 347 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for 34 yards and a touchdown. He also has the nation's longest active streak for passes without an interception. \nBut outside of Prescott, Mississippi State has little going for it. The Bulldogs (5-2, 1-2) are 98th nationally in rushing (Prescott is their leading rusher with 254 yards) and their defense is above average, but still in the middle of the pack. \nPrescott is the best player the school has ever had, as can be evidenced by looking at NFL rosters where the Bulldogs can be accurately described as Backup Running Back U. 3 \n9. Auburn might salvage a bowl game. Auburn needs two more wins to earn a bowl bid and beating Kentucky went a long way in that regard. Looking at the six games Auburn has left to play, there are four teams the Tigers (4-2, 1-2) have no business beating, one that looks like a toss-up and one the backups should be able to comfortably win. \nNext week's game against Arkansas is the toss-up. Following that with games against Ole Miss, Texas A&M, Georgia and Alabama means it's a must-win to feel good about playing in the postseason. The other game is against Idaho, which shouldn't require more than a glance at the final score, but I thought that about Jacksonville State too and Auburn almost lost that one. \nAnyway, the Tigers' defense (93rd nationally) is in no position to stop any of those teams (except Idaho) from hanging 40 or more points. And the way the Tigers' offense has looked to this point, the last thing they need is to get into a shootout. \nThe clash with the Hogs might be a battle for last place in the SEC West. \n10. The coaching carousel has started spinning. Steve Spurrier resigned this week and immediately went on ESPN's College GameDay to guest pick some games, and he didn't do all that well. \nHe was particularly terrible at picking SEC games, where he took Ole Miss, Florida and Texas A&M to win. They all lost. Maybe now we see why he left. (He did, however, correctly pick South Carolina to beat Vanderbilt and in typical Spurrier style got a good dig in over Southern Cal and South Carolina both calling themselves USC.) \nBut despite this being only halfway through the season, Spurrier isn't the only coach to be out of a job. The \"other\" USC dropped Steve Sarkisian over allegations of substance abuse and he checked into rehab. \nHe's not even the first coach to leave amid a scandal. Illinois dumped Tim Beckman before the season even started when he was accused of manipulating doctors and forcing players to play hurt. \nCentral Florida's George O'Leary appears to possibly be out the door of his own volition as well after stepping down as the school's interim athletic director. The Golden Knights are 0-7. And if you think the above linked comments about Hugh Freeze are bad, check out these emails Georgia fans have been sending Mark Richt. Ouch. \nAnd don’t forget Texas fans are still mad with Charlie Strong. This offseason may be more dramatic than the season has been. \nExtra points: 1 It's a battle they can't win. Even if you tried to watch the Mets and Cubs, staying there long enough just to see Matt Harvey get a strikeout meant missing something important in one of the three tight football games between ranked teams going on at the same time. I love baseball as much as anyone, but football will always be a better spectator sport. It's also worth noting that the World Series use to already be underway this time every year and now it's still more than a week away from starting. And there's more football on TV than ever before. \n2 They also have trouble getting their live tiger mascot into the stadium, but when he literally eats the opponent that doesn't matter much. It is, however, a knock against the universally ordained best home field advantage, because the presence of a tiger on the sideline is usually cited when touting Death Valley. \n3 Boobie Dixon, Malcolm Johnson and Josh Robinson are the only offensive skill position players the Bulldogs have, and they are all reserves. (Thanks to colleague @MattQuillenRNN and his NFL expertise for unearthing this little gem.) Also, it should be pointed out that I attended Louisiana Tech and may be a little bitter at the moment. 4 \n4 I am, but I'm used to it by now. \n\"What We Learned\" is a weekly column examining SEC football from an off-kilter perspective.
