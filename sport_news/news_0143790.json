Women pilots have been flying helicopters and transport planes for the past two decades, but combat roles for them have not been okayed due to various social reasons. Speaking at the Air Force parade at the Hindon airbase, some 20 km east of New Delhi, the IAF Chief said, “We have women pilots flying transport aircraft and helicopters. We are now planning to induct them into the fighter stream to meet the aspirations of young women of India”. Women in several other countries, including Pakistan, have been drafted to fly fighter jets, which usually fly at Mach-1, or the speed of sound. The jets carry missiles and bombs and are the first targets of enemy air defence guns and missiles fired from the ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:05:27.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
