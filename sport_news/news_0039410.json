Your juror may also have been convicted of failing to keep watch while towing a person on water skis or surfboard, or throwing a stink bomb into a crowd.\nHeather Visser, a spokeswoman for Ontario’s Ministry of the Attorney General, said people with certain kinds of criminal records have been shut out of jury duty since at least 1850.\n“Having people serve on a jury who themselves have certain types of criminal convictions could undermine confidence in the justice system,” Visser said in an email.\nShe would not say why having a pretend witchcraft practitioner, vagrant, convicted liar, or someone who makes indecent phone calls serve as a juror might not have that effect.\nLike Ontario, each province is responsible for maintaining its jury rolls, and qualification varies from one to the other.\nFor example, Alberta residents are excluded if they have been convicted of a criminal offence that carries a maximum sentence of more than one year, while being legally confined to an institution is one of the ineligibility criteria in Saskatchewan.\nResidents of British Columbia, on the other hand, need only be charged with a crime that carries a maximum fine of more than $2,000 or at least 12 months imprisonment to be excluded, while Newfoundland exempts anyone charged with an indictable offence or who has been jailed for same — if there was no option to pay a fine.\nEligibility to be a juror does not mean you will serve on one. Apart from provincial rules, the Criminal Code grants prosecutors and lawyers an unfettered right to challenge jurors who have been “sentenced to death” — or to a term of imprisonment exceeding 12 months. They also have some options to screen out others they deem undesirable.\nTangentially, a juror convicted in Ontario of disclosing a jury’s secret deliberations should in theory be allowed to serve on a subsequent panel. It’s a summary offence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:00:38.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
