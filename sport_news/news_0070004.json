Rescue teams were walking door to door to check on people stranded by the flooding.\nHaley said that although the emergency services were shifting from a response to assessment mode, the state remains in a \"vulnerable\" situation after going through a storm it \"has never seen before.\" While Hurricane Joaquin missed the East Coast, it fuelled a \"fire hose\" of tropical moisture aimed directly at the state, the weather service said.\nThe record for the most rain in 24 hours had been 14.80 inches, set during Hurricane Floyd in 1999.\nThat was smashed in several places, with some areas of the coast getting as much rain as they normally would in eight months, the National Weather Service said.\nIt reported almost 25 inches in Kingstree, 24 inches in the town of Longs in Horry County and 21 inches in Georgetown. â€”IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:12:55.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
