That's the mantra of the year — let's take it to another level — because we have gotten to Final Fours, we've gotten to five Final Fours since we won it in 2000,\" Izzo said last week. \"That's in what, 15 years? But we haven't won another one. So that's one reason for motivation.\n\"And I think our league is gonna even be better, when you look at it top to bottom, with Maryland up there, Indiana so high up there right now, there's a lot of good teams up there. So I think we have motivation to finish higher. And football motivates me.\n\"If we both have great years at the same time and build this athletic department into something that's incredible, I think that's motivation for our own players. A lot of them went down to the Western Michigan (football) game, they support them. So I've got a lot of reasons to be motivated. None more than, it's nice to get to a Final Four, it'd be nicer to win a national championship.\"\nConsidering Izzo's recruiting class for 2016, it's possible the Spartans will be among the favorites to do so in 2016-17. But his 2015-16 version has a senior star and leader in Denzel Valentine and the experience of last season's surprise Final Four run. And he has been happy with the off-season work.\n\"I think this team's got a chance to get better,\" he said.\n■ Champions Classic tickets: Tickets for the Champions Classic featuring MSU vs. Kansas and Duke vs. Kentucky in Chicago go on sale to the general public starting at noon Monday.
