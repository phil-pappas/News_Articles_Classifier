Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 3:30 pm Brew: Jayhawks should explore innovative fourth-down strategies Matt Hoffmann | @MattHoffmannUDK kansan.com Last season Texas Tech’s football team averaged 60.9 points per game. That’s about three points less per game than Baylor’s football team this year. To put that in perspective, Baylor averages 4.5 points per drive, not to mention the 745 yards they put up on average. The production of Baylor’s offense is going to be a near insurmountable for Kansas when the Jayhawks play against the Bears Saturday. The Jayhawks only average 22 points per game and 391 yards of total offense. It’s going to take pure luck, a trick play or five, and ingenious game planning for Kansas to have any chance at what would be one of the biggest upsets in college football history. That said, with nothing to lose, the statistics (that are all stacked against Kansas) say the Jayhawks should go for every fourth-down on Saturday inside of 10 yards. In layman’s terms, Kansas should not punt the ball on fourth down if the distance to go is less than 10 yards. It’s a highly unconventional and unlikely strategy to be implemented, it might just keep the game closer than many anticipate. For starters, Kansas has only converted on four of 11 fourth downs attempted this season. However, two of those attempts came from beyond 10 yards, and another from exactly the 10 yard mark. This means if Kansas can earn at least one yard on their first three downs, they are converting fourth-down attempts 50 percent of the time. Take that 50 percent of conversions and apply it to the number of punts KU has given away this year and the Jayhawks could increase their maximum scoring potential to 34.5 points per game (s hould they score a touchdown on each possession they extend with a fourth down conversion). Even with this increase in points, Kansas would still average 29.3 points less per game than Baylor. But when you throw in extra variables such as interceptions and a potential double possession in-and-out of halftime, should the coin toss go a certain way, we could have a fairly respectable game on our hands this Saturday. Imagine if   planned on going for every fourth down inside 10 yards regardless of field position. The Jayhawks would then theoretically face less than fourth-and-five a majority of the time, thereby inflating their maximum potential points per game. Going for it on fourth down also takes possessions away from Baylor since Kansas would not be freely punting the ball away. The Bears currently average about 14 possessions per game, two more than Kansas’ 12. However the Bears are more likely to give the ball back to the opposition because of their own score, versus the Jayhawks who punt at a much higher rate. If Kansas converted on 50 percent or more fourth-downs, it would keep the Baylor offense on the sidelines that much longer. It’s unlikely to happen, but Kansas will need to use all four downs consistently to have a chance at keeping the game against Baylor remotely tolerable for fans. — Edited by Abby Stuke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:01:32.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
