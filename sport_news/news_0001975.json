Strike partner Arkadiusz Milik claimed his sixth assist of the qualifying campaign by sliding a through ball into Lewandowski's path and the Bayern Munich man did the rest, sizing up David Marshall before passing it low into the net. \nScott Brown and Darren Fletcher were bypassed in midfield, and Russell Martin was caught out by the pace of Lewandowski, but it was a calm finish from the Poland international. \nFollowing the goal, Poland looked comfortable and threatened on the break through full-backs Lukasz Piszczek and Maciej Rybus, but Scotland grew into the game well and equalised on 45 minutes via a stunning strike from Matt Ritchie. \nThe winger had wasted two opportunities when well placed to cross for Steven Fletcher, but made up for it with a curling effort from 30 yards into Lukasz Fabianski's top corner. \nThe second half started at a blistering pace, with chances at both ends before Steven Fletcher completed the turnaround for Gordon Strachan's side. \nThe Sunderland man opened up his body to curl a left-footed shot over Fabianski from 15 yards on 62 minutes, sending Hampden into a frenzy and keeping their hopes of qualification alive. \nBut no sooner had Scotland gone ahead than news came through from Dublin that Shane Long had given the Republic of Ireland the lead against Germany. \nA victory for Ireland would mean that Scotland would have to win and hope that Martin O'Neill's side would then beat Poland on Sunday. \nBut Lewandowski's late equaliser rendered that scenario irrelevant. With Fabianski up from the back in the 94th minute, the Poland striker bundled home the equaliser after an in-swinging free-kick delivery from Poland's left flank caused chaos in the Scotland defence. \nGordon Strachan's team had defended superbly for 30 minutes following Fletcher's strike, with Marshall twice denying long-range efforts from Grzegorz Krychowiak, but they failed to see the job through in the dying seconds. \nWith Ireland's victory, Scotland find themselves on 12 points - six points behind Ireland and Poland with one match to play, extending their wait for a major tournament berth to 20 years as they now turn their attention towards qualification for the 2018 World Cup.
