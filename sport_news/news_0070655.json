But the kick was low, and Rod Rook-Chuncong managed to get a hand on it. \nWhile most of the Georgia Tech players celebrated, Austin went back to retrieve the ball, rolling along inside the 25-yard line. \nAt first, he seemed hesitant to pick it up. But then he did, taking off the other way in front of the Georgia Tech bench. He avoided Aguayo's diving attempt, then cut back on the final guy who had a shot at him to win the game for Georgia Tech (3-5, 1-4). Florida State was all set to win, but then forgot to kick the field goal. https://t.co/9OU7RHNxao https://t.co/zAS2S2vHfA â€” SB Nation GIF (@SBNationGIF) October 25, 2015 Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1N07Qn1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:50:06.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
