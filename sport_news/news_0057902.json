An NFL Network reporter was interviewing cornerback Adam \"Pacman\" Jones after a 34-21 win in Buffalo on Sunday, and the videographer's angle included several players coming out of the shower in the background. \nLeft tackle Andrew Whitworth was one of those shown. He said on Monday that the league should restrict media access to the locker room to prevent it from happening again. \nRiethmiller says the crew didn't follow network procedures that would have prevented the mistake.
