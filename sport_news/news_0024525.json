They led 10-7 in the decisive game only for Linn-Mar to score six of the next eight points for a 13-12 edge, receiving three kills from Amanda Ollinger and another attempt blocked out of bounds. A Carly Spies kill tied it, 14-14, and Linn-Mar was serving for the winning point after a Cedar Falls spike sailed long. A service error and Alicia Harrington kill propelled Cedar Falls (24-2, 5-1) to take control of second place in the Mississippi Valley Conference Valley Division. \nThe Tigers owned a strong size advantage with twice as many players at 5-foot-10 or taller. Ollinger and Spies are the tallest Lions at 6-1 and 6-2, respectively. \n“It was a great hard-fought match,” Kehe said. “No doubt, but sustaining that effort is a big important part of what we need to learn to do.” \nThe Lions trailed 15-9 in the fourth, but rallied to force the fifth set. Ollinger was key, tallying three straight kills in a five-point streak for the Lions. She also had two straight to tie it, 22-22, and another for a 24-23 lead. \nEven at this point, there are hard lessons to learn. This was a good experience for Linn-Mar (25-6, 4-2). \n“The biggest thing is the learning curve,” Ollinger said. “We definitely learned we need to finish games and what it feels like to be right there and not have it.” \nThe Lions had opportunities throughout the match, but Kehe said a lack of aggressiveness kept them from capitalizing on different situations. \n“Play hard every play,” Ollinger said. “Coach (Kehe) says we need to play intense and execute every play because you don’t know which point is going to matter.” \nThe performance is something that will help them as they get ready for the conference tournament and postseason play. \n“These are the kinds of matches we need,” Kehe said. “It helps prepare you for the tournament trail and being mentally tough.” \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:52:28.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
