The style of play has been around for years, but the Golden State Warriors’ NBA Finals win — with the series’ turning point in Game 4, where Steve Kerr moved Draymond Green to center and inserted Andre Iguodala at power forward — seems to have removed any lingering stigma about its legitimacy. Across the league, others teams are trying to follow suit.\nAfter finding playoff success with a small-ball tweak, the Washington Wizards added players like Jared Dudley to help make it a permanent part of their plan. The Indiana Pacers dumped center Roy Hibbert for a second-round pick and are alienating star wing Paul George by making him play power forward in their small-ball transition. Several other teams — the Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, Milwaukee Bucks — appear to be building their second-units as small-ball change-of-pace lineups. If your team didn’t spend the summer figuring out how they can play small, even if just to counteract a key opponent who will be using that style, then it’s falling behind.\nWhen Kerr pulled the small-ball lever in the Finals, it completely changed the on-court dynamic. Timofey Mozgov, who had been a terrific defender and pick-and-roll finisher for Cleveland, became a defensive liability. Tristan Thompson’s work on the offensive glass was canceled out by forcing him to defend a perimeter player. The defining lineup of that series — Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Iguodala and Green — was an extreme example of something that the Warriors had been utilizing all season. In 2014–15, Green started 79 games at power forward; in his two previous seasons, he had played roughly two-thirds of his minutes as a small forward.\nNBA Examining the best and worst bets for the 2015—16 NBA over/under lines by Ben Golliver", "external_links": ["http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/greendr01.html#advanced_pbp::none"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:37:45.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
