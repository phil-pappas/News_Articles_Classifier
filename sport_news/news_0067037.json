We can't out-run them,\" Skinstad said. \n\"The only way we can win is traditional powerhouse South African rugby and the players will not need to be psyched up for that, they will be really excited about this game. \n\"They'll love the clash and will want to smash into the All Blacks. More than anything, they'll just be pleased to have a chance to do that. \n\"We have to go really hard in the forwards for a long time before we can look to go wide. The All Blacks will go wide earlier than us. \n\"It's going to be a massive clash. If The Springboks are on song they'll be in with a shout. \n\"South Africa will be thinking 'we've pushed the All Blacks close before, so let's prepare for fire and brimstone. Let's take them on and march on to the goal'. \n\"New Zealand looked special against France, but France let them play like that. Maybe they've laid their World Cup bogey against French teams to rest now. \n\"But New Zealand are also a southern hemisphere side that we see a lot of. \n\"We play them twice a year so they won't be able to outfox the Springboks as easily as they did the French, but they're still a powerful team.\" \nSchalk Burger was man of the match in the 23-19 victory over Wales but unusually for an openside, spent most of the match operating at first receiver. He received rave reviews, but Skinstad was less impressed. \n\"I know Schalk and I love Schalk. He's a fantastic player but for me he's standing at first receiver too much,\" Skinstad said. \n\"You can't begrudge him the number of contributions he's made, but it's about the quality of those contributions. \n\"Did he off-load to somebody who ran through a gap? Did he lose the ball on the ground? \n\"He's playing well but against New Zealand he needs to carry less and tackle more. He needs to do the hard yards, clean out more. \n\"Schalk is a great contributor but he needs to spend less time at fly-half if South Africa are going to win.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:13:44.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
