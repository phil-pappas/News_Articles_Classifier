He said the ten-day time period may not be considered as a deadline but it would be enough to understand the seriousness of the BCCI for the resumption of Pak-India series. \"At the moment the chances of Pak-India series are very bleak but we have not yet closed the doors,\" he said adding, \"If we do not hear anything positive from BCCI then we will consider it a no from them and the MOU (memorandum of understanding) signed between the two countries for holding Pak-India series will be null and void.' He said the attack of Shiv Sena activists at the headquarters in Mumbai, withdrawal of ICC elite penal umpire, Aleem Dar from the ongoing cricket series between India and South Africa and threats to Pakistani former test cricketers Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar not to act as commentators are clear indicators that India does not have conducive circumstances for holding international cricket. \"Games ruling body, the international cricket council and all the cricket playing countries across the globe have come to the reality that a group of extremists have taken over the control of cricket affairs and its allied matters which is quite unfortunate,\" he said. PCB Chairman said that he visited India on the invitation of Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for an official meeting and he did not go there on his own. \"It was an official tour, not a courtesy visit, and I went to India after receiving official invitation from BCCI,\" he said. To prove his claim, Chairman PCB, distributed the copies of the invitation letter of the BCCI to the mediam men. He said the meeting with the Indian Board President, Shashank Manohar was fixed at BCCI headquarters, Mumbai to discuss various cricket matters but unfortunately Shiv Sena activists stormed into the BCCI headquarters. \"We watched the whole situation on TV which was very alarming,\" he said. \"We waited around 36 hours for a re-scheduled meeting but there was no reply from BCCI for conducting the official meeting which was against the norms of hospitality and we will be writing a letter to them in this regard,\" he added. Shaharyar said PCB would be suffering huge financial loss of Rs five million in terms of TV rights if the series does not take place. \"We will be able to overcome the loss as we have not played India in a bilateral series for last eight years and despite that we are running our cricket activities,\" he maintained. \"We will be exploring other options which are the part of our plan B to overcome the loss,\" he said but did not elaborate the plan B. Chairman PCB emphasized the need to keep politics away from cricket and called for cricket diplomacy. \"If we play cricket on bilateral basis it will help ease out tension and to resolve other issues,\" he said. \"In the past when tension was at rise between the two countries, cricket activities took places between Pak-India and in the given circumstances we still believe that we can look into the possibilities for resumption of bilateral series,\" said Shaharyar.
