I will do my utmost to maintain the high standards of success, class and character established by Jerry, Coach K and the many players who have sacrificed their time on behalf of USA Basketball.” \nSince a bronze-medal showing at the 2004 Athens Olympics sparked a revamp of the US program, American teams have gone 75-1, including a 63-game win streak since losing to Greece in the 2006 semi-finals of what was then called the World Basketball Championships. \nPopovich, a 1970 graduate of the US Air Force Academy, has coached the Spurs for 19 seasons, making him the longest-tenured coach in any major North American sport. His 18 consecutive winning seasons trail only Pat Riley’s 19 and Phil Jackson’s 20 in NBA history. \nWith an international squad led by France’s Tony Parker, Argentina’s Manu Ginobili and US Virgin Islander Tim Duncan, the Spurs won NBA crowns under Popovich’s guidance in 1999, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2014. He was named the NBA Coach of the year in 2003, 2012 and 2014. \nPopovich has an NBA regular-season career record of 1,022-470, the third-best win percentage in NBA history and just 105 wins behind Jerry Sloan’s record for all-time wins with a lone NBA team, and is 152-94 in NBA playoff contests. \n“There’s no doubt in my mind that we have the great fortune of bringing on board one of the NBA’s best and most successful coaches ever,” Colangelo said. “By making this decision now, it will allow us to have a clean, efficient and immediate transition following the 2016 Olympic Games.” \n“This progression plan will also help ensure that our national team will continue to build on the culture and success we have achieved since launching the program.” \nKrzyzewski was pleased to have Popovich as his replacement. \n“Gregg Popovich is the ideal choice to take over as coach of the USA program. His long track record of success — both in terms of winning championships and creating a culture of excellence — are well documented and, rightfully so, he is considered among the very best coaches in the world.” \nPopovich was general manager of the Spurs for more than two seasons before taking over as coach when the team began the season 3-15. The Spurs won their first NBA crown in his second full season as coach. \nPopovich served as an assistant coach for the US squad that finished third at Athens in 2004 and settled for sixth as host of the 2002 worlds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:50:44.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
