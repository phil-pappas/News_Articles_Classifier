Beason was taken into the locker room to get checked out, and the results of the testing confirmed that he suffered a concussion.\nBeason’s replacement at middle linebacker, rookie Uani ’Unga, two plays later teamed with Jay Bromley to stop Reggie Bush for a loss of a yard on third down.\nSo it goes for Beason, who missed the first two games of the season with a sprained knee — after playing in only four games last season before heading to injured reserve following foot surgery.\nBeason will get an extra day to get through the concussion protocol as the Giants next play Monday night in Philadelphia.\nShane Vereen came up big on the game-winning drive with move-the-chain catches for 11, 16 and 24 yards, finding openings in the 49ers man coverage. Once a favorite target of Tom Brady with the Patriots, this was Vereen’s first comeback with Eli Manning at the controls.\n“It says that, you know, we’ve got a better quarterback than a lot of people think but we love him, we trust him, we follow him, he’s our leader,’’ Vereen said. “We shouldn’t expect anything less.’’\nLeft guard Justin Pugh said he “tweaked’’ his ankle late in the fourth quarter and was upset he had to come off the field for the final two plays. He was replaced by John Jerry. Pugh said he will be fine for next week’s game in Philadelphia.\nJosh Brown’s 24-yard field goal in the fourth quarter was his 17th consecutive made field goal, matching his own team record.\nTE Will Tye became the first player from Stony Brook to ever catch a pass in an NFL game. Tye had four receptions for 48 yards.\nManning, in the third quarter, passed Kerry Collins and moved into 12th place on the NFL’s all-time passing yardage list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:20:07.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
