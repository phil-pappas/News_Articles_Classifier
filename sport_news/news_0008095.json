All that was missing were the leather helmets and some mud for good measure. \nRocori won the Section 8-4A championship Friday night, beating Willmar 7-0. \nThe Spartans play Hermantown at 7 p.m. Friday at Brainerd High School in the state Class 4A quarterfinals. The top-seeded Hawks (10-0) beat third-seeded Princeton 42-14 in the Section 7-4A final. \nThe game at two-year-old Viking Savings Bank Field was played in a steady rain that picked up in the second half. With temperatures topping out at 50 and a steady wind, conditions proved to be a huge factor in slowing down two teams that relay on spread, no-huddle offenses. And that's even with the pristine artificial field turf. \n\"All the credit goes to the defense,\" Rocori junior quarterback Connor Schoborg said. \"They were tough and stayed tough all night. \n\"There were a couple of big plays (by Willmar). But that was it.\" \nThe Spartans (8-3) repeat as section champions and make the state quarterfinals for the third time in the Mike Rowe era at Rocori.

The Spartans recorded their second straight shutout. They beat higher-seeded Detroit Lakes 33-0 last week, using their size advantage on the offensive line to maximum effect. \nFifth-seeded Willmar (5-6) matched up better than the Lakers. But the Cardinals simply struggled to move the ball on the ground or in the air. \n\"We bent but didn't break,\" Rocori junior linebacker Nathan Thorpe said. \"This has been our goal from the start.\" \nWillmar rushed 35 times for 87 yards and completed nine of 27 passes for 129 yards. There was a big interception by Gunnar Feldhege. There were several quarterback sacks and tackles for loss. \nMostly, the Cards were pretty frustrated.

The Rocori senior had a big night punting with the game on the line in the second half, twice pinning the Cardinals inside the 10 on 40-plus-yard punts with no return. \n\"It seemed like we did that like 10 times,\" Rowe said. \nMoving the ball proved difficult all night. Field position was vital. Skluzacek, who also contributes on offense and defense, was ecstatic. \n\"It feels incredible,\" Skluzacek said of the victory. \"I'm happy I could get the chance (to contribute).\" \nThat's pretty much how Mitchell Heinen was feeling, too. \nThe senior wide receiver caught his first touchdown pass with 8:13 remaining in the second quarter. \nIt was three-yard pass from Schoborg on a fourth-and-2 play. Schoborg's primary targets were covered. He rolled right. Heinen's defender came up to stop Schoborg from scrambling for the touchdown. \nThat left Heinen wide open in the back of the end zone. \n\"It feels great, just awesome,\" said a smiling Heinen. \"That was a lot of fun.\" \nThe touchdown completed a 10-play, 65-yard drive and included four completed passes. That's one more than the Spartans completed in the second half as conditions worsened. \n\"It seemed like we were more balanced offensively in the first half,\" Rowe said. \"In the second half, we kind of failed to finish in the red zone a couple times. \n\"It really was (about the tough conditions).\" \nWillmar was 7-for-17 throwing the football in the second half, mostly because it had to put it up. Rocori, ran the ball 47 times for 132 yards. Schoborg completed 13 of 27 passes for 159 yards with one touchdown and one interception, a pick by Max Trochlil at the Cardinals' 1-yard line. \nThe Spartans also lost one fumble. But overall, it was a solid effort. No one seemed to mind afterward as the players smiled and accepted congratulations from fans and family. \n\"I'm just fortunate to be able to play for and help lead such a great team,\" Schoborg said.
