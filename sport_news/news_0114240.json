The wrong judges heard the damning details of accused cop-killer Tyrone Howard’s violent role in a wild 2009 shootout that left two East Harlem bystanders wounded.\nThe Manhattan district attorney’s office put a blazing gun in the hands of the oft-arrested gangbanger in a powerful legal brief — filed with an appeals court in August, three months after Howard dodged prison.\nAP Tyrone Howard's mere involvement in the 2009 gunfight persuaded another judge four years ago to reject him for rehab. And it’s unclear if Howard’s prosecutor was ever aware that his colleagues in another office had the ammunition to keep the PCP-addicted drug dealer incarcerated.\n“The evidence was more than sufficient to show that . . . Howard became involved in a gun battle with the result that (the bystanders) were hit with their stray bullets,” prosecutors wrote in their brief to the Appellate Division.\nAn 11-year-boy was shot in the ankle and a 77-year-old man blasted in the back before the shooting stopped, with more than a dozen bullets fired from two separate guns, officials said.\nThe legal brief defended the 2011 conviction of Dan Evans, a small-time pot dealer. Evans was convicted in the attempted murder of Howard and the shootings of senior citizen Pedro Morales and the boy.\nThe 11-year-old recognized both Evans and Howard from the neighborhood and spotted them arguing at the edge of the court before the shooting, court papers showed.\nThe boy testified that as Howard stormed off, Evans opened fire at his back. The youth testified that he bolted from the hail of bullets before seeing Howard’s reaction — but recalled the man was wearing dark clothes.\nRick Kopstein / New York Law Journal Judge Edward McLaughlin knew of 2009 shooting allegedly involving cop-killing suspect Tyrone Howard, but it’s not clear he told Judge Patricia Nunez before she sent him to drug treatment in May, instead of jail. Enlarge Judge Patricia Nunez Enlarge The two judges who allowed the career criminal to enter a drug treatment program in May, Edward McLaughlin(l.) and Patricia Nunez, never heard the specifics of the gunfight on a basketball court in the East River Houses on June 15, 2009, court records show.\nJefferson Siegel/New York Daily News Career criminal Tyrone Howard is charged in murder of NYPD Officer Randolph Holder. There was no ballistic evidence in the case, but the judge at Evans’ trial told jurors that it didn’t matter whether Evans or Howard fired the shots that hit the victims.\n“Each was the accomplice to the other,” Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman told jurors, who convicted Evans for both the 2009 shooting and an unrelated 2006 murder.\nOne witness heard gunshots and looked out her window to see a man with “dark clothing over a white T-shirt.”\nA second witness spied a man in a black hooded sweatshirt and jeans walking out of the complex holding a gun.\nThe descriptions matched what the 11-year-old said about Howard’s garb, and “provided proof that defendant was not the only one with a gun on those basketball courts,” the prosecutors said.\nCourt records show none of the cited evidence was publicly disclosed to either Justice McLaughlin — who allowed Howard to apply for the drug diversion program — or to Justice Nunez, who approved it.\nIn fact, it was Howard’s own lawyer who reminded McLaughlin of his client’s arrest in the 2009 case, according to a transcript of a December 2014 hearing.\n“Howard was a career criminal with a long history of arrests and convictions, as reflected on his rap sheet available to all the parties,” she said.\n“We could not have been more clear in our assessment of the case at the time it was referred for diversion over our objection.”\nThe suspect’s mere involvement in the 2009 gunfight persuaded another judge four years ago to reject him for rehab.\nCharges against Howard were dropped in the 2009 shooting after the wounded pair couldn’t identify him in a lineup. If convicted, Howard’s eligibility for any drug diversion program would have disappeared.\nbross@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories EXCLUSIVE: NYCHA tried to ban suspected cop killer Murder rap for suspect in killing of Officer Randolph Holder Gunfire victim expresses outrage over alleged cop killer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:02:01.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
