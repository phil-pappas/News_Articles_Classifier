Taj Griffin finished with 110 yards rushing and a score, while receiver Bralon Addison threw a TD pass on a trick play to help the Ducks (3-2, 1-1 Pac-12) rebound from a 62-20 home loss to Utah last weekend. It was Oregon’s fifth straight win over Colorado (3-2, 0-1) since the Buffaloes joined the conference in 2011 — and by far the closest. The Ducks won the previous four meetings by an average of 43.5 points. They entered this game just a touchdown favorite. There was a moment of silence before kickoff for the people who died in the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, which is about 70 miles from Eugene.
