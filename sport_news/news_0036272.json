We can't just try to survive practice. We have to try to get better at practice and get better during the weeks.\"\nDespite forcing seven turnovers in last Saturday's 17-7 win at Charlotte, the Owls' mistakes could have been very costly.\nQuarterback Jaquez Johnson's fourth-quarter interception was returned 28 yards for a touchdown, pulling the 49ers to within 10-7. FAU was only able to seal the victory with Ocie Rose's 60-yard interception return for a score late in the fourth quarter.\n\"You've got to have focus throughout the week,\" Wright said. \"You can't just show up on Saturday.\"\nWright said the bye week comes at the perfect time, because the team has so many offensive issues to work on. The Owls will practice Wednesday and Thursday before taking the weekend off.\n\"Let's just work on the things that need improved fundamentally,\" Wright said.\nNext game: FAU vs. Rice, 2:30 p.m., Oct. 10, Fox College Sports.\nSrichardson@tribpub.com\n UNC Charlotte 49ers", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560db949/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-0930-20150929"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:46:29.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
