Her allegiance to the team began at an early age when her father, a farmer, instructed her to listen to the games and keep a scorecard while he worked in the fields. \"Usually, about halfway through the game, I'd walk out in bare feet, bring him some iced tea and cookies and show him the scorecard and let him know how things were going,\" Barnes said. Now, she watches and listens to Cubs games from the comfort of her apartment at the assisted living community in Freeport. Barnes and other residents, like Vernon Holesinger, are among the thousands of fans who have caught Cubs fever during the team's 2015 playoff run. Holesinger loved listening to Harry Caray during the legendary broadcaster's 16-year tenure with the Chicago Cubs . Oakley Courts Activities Director Chris Bamburg said she and staff even organized a recreational baseball game for residents ahead of Game 3 on Monday. \"It was a big hit,\" Bamberg said. \"We have so many lifelong fans that have really gotten into the spirit.\" Barnes, Holesinger and other residents said they're tired of waiting for the Cubs to finally win a World Series. \"I've been a fan my whole life,\" Barnes said. \"It's time they win one for me!\" Karen Patterson: 815-232-0133; Karen.patterson@Journalstandard.com ; @KarenP_FJS By Karen Patterson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:19:53.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
