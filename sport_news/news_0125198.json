Smith know something the rest of us don't, or they simply misread the news about Odom. Here's what Lil Wayne tweeted:\nR.I.P LO Dam man. My blessings to ur fam and friends.\n— Lil Wayne WEEZY F (@LilTunechi) October 14, 2015\nSmith gave a lengthier tribute to Odom on Instagram:\nRIP LO damn man I can't believe this... If this isn't a sign I don't know what is!!! This life is so much bigger then basketball an any other sport! I can't imagine what he was going through but I know he could have had some better people in his corner! Life doesn't care how much money you made or how man championships you have when its time to go it's time to go! Some people say \"it's easy to be happy you have millions!\" With all the money that comes trust an believe it comes with just as much heartache! Learning a balance is key never get to high on the highs an never get to low on the lows! #RIPLO\nA photo posted by JR Smith (@teamswish) on Oct 14, 2015 at 5:45am PDT\nOther current and former NBA players, meanwhile, were tweeting #PrayersForLamar:\n#PrayersForLamar Lefty with gammeeee!!\n— Reggie Bullock (@ReggieBullock35) October 14, 2015\nEveryone please pray for @RealLamarOdom to make it through this.
