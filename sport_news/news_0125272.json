The Lady Falcons and Lady Chargers have clinched playoffs spots and are scheduled to play each other for the second time in district at noon Saturday at Los Fresnos. \nWhile Brownsville Veterans may have surprised many by being in this position again with a team that came into its 2015 campaign as basically an unknown quantity, the Lady Chargers themselves are not at all surprised to be doing so well. \nEven though the Lady Chargers graduated some key players from last year’s successful team, including All-Valley hitter Mariza Cardenas, they still brought back three experienced starters who have led the way for the team’s newcomers. Their presence has made a big difference, coach Lisa Mares said. \nThose three returning senior starters are libero Krista Lopez and front-line hitters Sarah Sandoval and Megan Sanchez. \n“I was real optimistic about our season because of those three girls,” said Mares, who last year guided the Lady Chargers to a 34-12 record and the third round of the playoffs. “All three of them are super athletic girls, and all three have been with me since their sophomore years. \n“I knew it might be difficult because in past seasons those three hadn’t really been vocal leaders on the team, but I was still optimistic that we would do well,” added Mares, who is assisted by Arnold Torres. “I felt it was going to take some time but that we were going to get there because of those three. They may not be all that vocal, but the way they play speaks for itself.” \nThrough the course of the season, the Lady Chargers have evolved into one of the top teams in the Rio Grande Valley. \n“We’ve been practicing together for a while now,” said Lopez, a 5-foot-2 libero and three-year starter. “We’ve gotten used to each other. We’re not (just) good as individuals, we’re good together. \n“I think if we work together as a team, we have the potential to go far (in the playoffs),” added Lopez, who leads the team with 421 digs and 33 aces. “The key is working together. It’s been a process getting there. We had some sophomores move up (to the varsity) and we didn’t really know them, so it’s taken some time. \n“In the beginning of the season, I think people didn’t really see us as being one of the better teams because we weren’t ranked. I believe that’s what has motivated us to get to (near) the top (of district) again, and we’re right there (challenging for another title).” \nAdded Sanchez, a 5-9 middle blocker/hitter who has started one season, “I think a lot of us are really willing to work hard to be successful. All of us were here during the summer for conditioning, and we do a lot of other (volleyball) things outside of school like playing club ball. I think that makes the difference for this team.” \nRoy Hess covers sports for The Brownsville Herald. You can reach him via email at rhess@brownsvilleherald.com .
