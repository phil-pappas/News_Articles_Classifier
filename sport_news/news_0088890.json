Some of the guys who have had it done said it took them over a year to be pain-free. I hope it doesn't take me that long to be pain-free.'' \nWoods also said he played the majority of 2015 in pain, which ended up being his worst season as a pro. \nFor recovery from the Sept. 16 surgery, Woods will be out the rest of the year, but he said he hopes to return sometime in 2016. \nCopyright   Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 7:44PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:28:09.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
