The potential legislation — as currently written — would place the burden of enforcing the rule on the NJSIAA. \nTimko and other officials expressed concern over potential oversight for the bill. \nRELATED : Sen. Codey to push bill penalizing athletes who repeat grades for athletic edge \n“As it progresses we’ll continue to work with Sen. [Richard] Codey and the other sponsors,” Timko said. “I see where his issues are and I understand what they are. But at the same time being able to manage it might be difficult. We don’t have any jurisdiction over the middle school programs and a lot of those situations are there. Non-public schools could be another situation. As this thing continues to move forward hopefully he’ll be working with us and I think he will.” \nPaul Anzano, special counsel to the NJSIAA for legislative affairs, said the organization “would love to prohibit it or stop it or deter it, but with Codey’s proposal, enforcement becomes a question.” \nCoaches and recruiting analysts say athletes everywhere are repeating or “redshirting” in middle school in record numbers. The athletes who do it often grow bigger, stronger and faster, and become more polished athletes to better draw the attention of coaches and recruiters. Currently, there are no rules against athletes repeating a grade in middle school. \nNJSIAA attorney Steve Goodell said the organization already has protocol in place to deter redshirting at the high school level. A student-athlete is not eligible to compete as a high school senior if he or she turns 19 before Sept. 1 of that school year. And an athlete can only play sports for four consecutive years or eight consecutive semesters once they reach high school. \nRELATED : How to build a sports superstar in 2015: The engineering of 15-year-old Josh McKenzie \n“We share the concerns of the sponsor about redshirting,” Goodell said. “We have our own provisions against redshirting at the high school level. We generally don’t think that it’s good for a kid’s development. They shouldn’t be promoting sports over academics.” \nAnzano said reaction to the bill has been “mixed.” \n“It is inappropriate,” Anzano added. “But the public comments have been mixed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:32:48.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
