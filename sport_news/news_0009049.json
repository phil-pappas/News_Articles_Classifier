That’s all very nice, but Ian Clark is looking for a penthouse move: a seat on the bench of the world champion Warriors.\nAs it stands right now, heading into Tuesday night’s exhibition game against the Clippers at Staples Center , Clark has the edge on Chris Babb , Jarell Eddie and Juwan Staten for that final roster spot. Shaun Livingston and Leandro Barbosa are the primary backcourt backups, and swingman Brandon Rush is virtually guaranteed a spot, but head coach Steve Kerr and general manager Bob Myers are looking for a shooter, someone who can light up the arena from three-point range.\nClark just might be that man.\nDuring his four-year career at Belmont, including three trips to the NCAA Tournament, Clark spent long stretches averaging more than 50 percent on three-point tries and finished at an overall 42.5. That’s his calling card, evident from the moment he signed with the Warriors as a free agent in September.\n“He’s been great for us,” interim head coach Luke Walton said before Saturday night’s game against the Lakers . “He was great all through training camp, too. He can score the ball, which is what we like. He has a nice floater game when he gets in with the bigs, and he can obviously shoot from outside. He competes on defense, which is another thing we look at.\n“It’s too early to say (regarding his status), but he’s done everything he can do as far as impressing us and the front office. He’s put himself in a good position.”\nBy the time Clark was finished at Belmont, the school had been elevated from Atlantic Sun into the Ohio Valley Conference, which named him Co-Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year in his senior year (2012-13). Belmont’s tournament stays were brief — it was eliminated in the round of 64 all three seasons — and he went unselected in the NBA draft.\nHe didn’t need long to state his case. Hooking up with the Warriors’ Summer League team in Las Vegas, he came off the bench in the championship game against Phoenix and scored 33 points, including a 7-for-10 hot streak from long range. He signed as a free agent almost immediately thereafter with the Utah Jazz , beginning a vagabond-style journey through the NBA (the Jazz and Denver Nuggets ) and Development League stops with the Bakersfield Jam and Idaho Stampede.\nFittingly, he made his finest NBA impressions against the Warriors, scoring a career-high 10 points for Utah in November 2013 at Oracle Arena, but he didn’t find a home, getting waived by the Jazz in his second stint with the club late last season.\nSo there he was in the visitors’ locker room Saturday night, packed into tiny quarters with his teammates in an arena that should have been shut down years ago. Respectfully, he kept his comments quiet — and his confidence high — during an interview.\n“I’m feeling really comfortable, in the games and in practice,” he said. “The guys are really helping me out. I’m looking to bring a defensive mind-set, wreak havoc out there, be a pest, and knock down some shots when they’re there for me. We’ve got the best two shooters in the league right now, so (laughter) ... I’ll just try to help out as much as possible.”\nThe Warriors’ practices are known for their lighthearted mood, a tone set by Kerr last season, and some epic outside-shooting contests. “I’m definitely up for that,” he said. “Steph (Curry) and Klay (Thompson) have their own workout, but with the other guys, I’m trying to make sure I stand out.”\nClark said he was disappointed to go undrafted, but the slight lit a fire in him, one that still burns. “I knew I had to prove myself in other ways,” he said. “Summer League, predraft workouts, wherever I got a chance, and I never got complacent. I’ve been playing with a chip on my shoulder since I graduated college; it’s kind of what’s keeping me going now.”\nClark had occasional difficulty guarding Lakers rookie D’Angelo Russell on Saturday night, but Clark played 19 mostly solid minutes and shot 3-for-5 from the floor, including two three-pointers that brought the Warriors’ reserves to their feet.\n“He struggled with some things, but you don’t judge a player on just one night,” Walton said afterward. “We’re putting him out there at different positions, with different lineups, and that can be hard on a player. But if he’s gonna make the team, that’s gonna be his role. The great thing about Ian, he doesn’t get down, doesn’t shy away from a moment after something bad happens.\n“He just keeps working and trying to do the right thing.”\nBruce Jenkins is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.
