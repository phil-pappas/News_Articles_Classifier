Now bring on Arrieta and Lester. \nNobody in the champagne-soaked clubhouse bursting with elated New York Mets would utter those words Thursday, but it was clear the confidence they gained after beating two of the world’s top pitchers would carry forth in their next test. \nThat will be a National League Championship Series clash with the young and hot Chicago Cubs, after the Mets bumped off the $300 million Los Angeles Dodgers with a 3-2 victory in Game 5 of the Division Series. \nIn a taut series dominated by power pitching — the clubs tied a record for strikeouts through the first four games — it was heads-up baserunning and a tie-breaking home run by Daniel Murphy that tipped the scales in the Mets’ favor. \nThey didn’t figure to prevail when facing Cy Young Award winners Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke twice each in a five-game series, yet they beat each one once and now as a reward get to face Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester. \n\"Like I said here (about the Dodgers’ duo), they’re quality pitchers, but our pitching is very good as well,\" outfielder Yoenis Cespedes said. \"We’re going to continue doing what we’ve done so far, and with the confidence we have now, things will go well for us.\" \nWith a stable of young flamethrowers featuring Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Matt Harvey, the Mets can shut down any attack. The Dodgers can bear witness after striking out 54 times in the five games. The NL’s top home run-hitting club managed just two against New York pitching. \nDeGrom, overpowering in striking out a record-tying 13 Dodgers in a Game 1 victory, showed he could be resourceful as well Thursday. He allowed runners to reach scoring position in each of the first five innings, but after giving up two runs in the first, he bent but refused to break in the next five. \nRather than trying to blow away L.A. batters, deGrom fooled them with his breaking pitches, stranding eight runners between the first and sixth. \n\"Tonight was a battle,\" deGrom said. \"I knew I didn’t have my best stuff early on. Actually, the first inning I felt pretty good. They didn’t hit the ball too hard, but they found some holes. That was the last thing I wanted to do, give up two runs and put us behind. After that I just tried to settle in.\" \nHe got a boost from Murphy’s heroics. The lefty-swinging second baseman had taken Kershaw deep twice in the series, once each in Games 1 and 4, before teeing off on a Greinke fastball in the sixth for a 3-2 lead held up by Syndergaard in the seventh and Jeurys Familia in the last two innings. \nFamilia, a closer for the first time this season, retired all 16 batters he faced in the series and became the first Met to record a six-out save in the postseason since Jesse Orosco closed out the 1986 World Series. \nThat’s what Cubs hitters can look forward to late in NLCS games. \n\"He's the best closer in the game,\" Syndergaard said, \"and he did exactly what we thought he was going to do, and that is shut the door.\" \nBut what got the Mets past the most expensive team in American sports was not merely power arms but also smarts and moxie. They overcame the loss of shortstop Ruben Tejada, out for the postseason with a broken leg sustained on a late slide by Chase Utley in Game 2, a play that turned that game in the Dodgers’ favor and appeared to shift the momentum their way. \nInstead, the Mets won a 13-7 slugfest at Citi Field in Game 3 and, after losing to Kershaw the next night, handed Greinke his first playoff loss at home in six starts. One long-suffering MLB team is going to win the World Series \nMurphy was directly involved in all three of the runs. After putting New York ahead 1-0 with an RBI double in the first, Murphy set up the tying run with his legs and brains in the fourth. \nThird baseman Justin Turner was stationed in the second baseman’s usual position as L.A. shifted its defense for lefty-swinging Lucas Duda. When Duda walked, Murphy trotted to second and, noticing third unattended and Greinke looking down with the ball in his hands, sped to the bag and reached it uncontested. \nMurphy then scored easily on Travis d’Arnaud’s sacrifice fly to right field. \n\"I've never been in the playoffs before,\" Murphy said, \"but starting to understand how valuable 90 feet are. It's absolutely massive.\" \nThe Dodgers will have all season to ruminate over those critical 90 feet they gave away and their 2-for-13 hitting with runners in scoring position. Nightengale: Postseason GMs muse over 3-month-old trades \nThey’ll also ponder the possibility of losing Greinke — who has an opt-out in his contract he’s likely to exercise, although he has expressed a desire to return — and whether to bring back manager Don Mattingly. \nFor the second time in three weeks, Mattingly was the subject of a player’s dugout rant, as outfielder Andre Ethier was seen yelling at him in the bottom of the third. \nBoth sides later downplayed the incident, with Ethier saying, \"It wasn’t like we were going at each other. We were just in the moment, worrying about what was going on in the game and being passionate about what we were doing out there.\" \nLos Angeles has won three consecutive NL West crowns with Mattingly at the helm, and as opposed to previous postseasons, he didn’t make any truly questionable moves in the playoffs. The Dodgers certainly did not lose this series because of him. \nHowever, the so-called best team money can buy failed to advance past the first round in each of the last two years and is still seeking the franchise’s first trip to the World Series since 1988, or seven months after Kershaw was born. \n\"It's disappointing no matter what the situation is,\" Mattingly said. \"You work too hard. You put in too many hours. You travel. Things that guys go through to get here is extraordinary, and it comes to a crash and you can't — I don't think there is any way to soften that blow.\" \nGALLERY: METS vs. DODGERS Posted!
