Is Baker passing up pot of taxes? By Baker City Herald Editorial Board October 14, 2015 12:35 pm Oregon’s marijuana stores have done a brisk business since recreational sales became legal Oct. 1. Retailers reported sales topping $11 million during the first week. None of those sales was in Baker County. Baker County is one of six counties where elected commissioners have voted to ban retail pot sales in unincorporated areas. And Baker City is among the 13 cities where elected councilors voted to do the same. Critics of those votes lament that the city and county are letting a potential financial windfall pass us by, both in the form of sales revenue and taxes. Well, probably not. As for retail sales, no one opened a medical marijuana dispensary in Baker City or Baker County even when neither jurisdiction had banned such businesses. This shouldn’t surprise anyone — there are just 246 medical marijuana patients in Baker County, according to the Oregon Health Authority. That’s not much of a customer base. As for taxes, we haven’t missed out on a single dollar — yet. That’s because the state won’t tax recreational pot sales until Jan. 4, when medical marijuana dispensaries, which are regulated by the Health Authority, must collect a 25-percent tax on recreational pot sales. And when recreational retail stores (which will be regulated by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission) begin opening later in 2016, those businesses will collect a 17-percent sales tax. By voting to ban retail sales, Baker City and Baker County will lose some of that tax revenue. The state will distribute 10 percent of pot sales taxes to cities and 10 percent to counties, but jurisdictions, like Baker City and Baker County, that have banned sales won’t get their share. Cities and counties that allow sales can also add a 3-percent sales tax. Although we agree with local officials’ decision to ban pot sales — almost 60 percent of county voters opposed legalizing recreational use of pot, much less its sale — they have an obligation to find out how much money they are passing up by doing so. That’s the only way to know what the real stakes are — at least the financial stakes — in this debate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:26:12.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
