A further 350 million euros are expected to come in by 2024 for the sale of real estate at the newly constructed OlympiaCity on the Kleiner Grasbrook which will include the athletes' village. \nThe city will also need to build several key venues, including the 60,000-seater Olympic stadium and the swimming arena among other. \n\"This results in a negative balance of 7.4 billion euros to be funded through he public sector,\" the report said. \nHamburg, who beat the capital Berlin to be Germany's choice, will hold a referendum on Nov. 29 for the citizens to decide whether they want the Games or not as bid officials look for strong local support for their project. \nBritain spent around 9 billion pounds (S$19.4 billion) of public money when it staged the 2012 Olympics in London.
