Officials flagged the 6-5, 240-pound sophomore for blocking Mississippi State defensive back Brandon Bryant on a first-down pass from Kyle Allen to Josh Reynolds.\nSeals-Jones caught his first touchdown pass of the season, a 1-yard grab, on fourth-and-goal in the first quarter to give A&M a 7-0 lead. He had five catches for 34 yards before he was ejected.\nA&M senior kicker Taylor Bertolet drilled a 55-yard field goal in the second quarter to give A&M a 17-3 lead. It was the longest by an A&M kicker since a 62-yarder in 1999. Bertolet missed a 38-yard attempt in the previous week's game against Arkansas that would've given A&M the win at the end of regulation.\nBertolet's previous career high was 54 yards, which he hit against Louisiana Tech in 2012. Bertolet was 3-of-4 from 50 yards or longer for his career entering the season.\nBertolet missed a 49-yard attempt wide right late in the second quarter. He made a 24-yard field goal in the third quarter to give A&M a 27-10 lead.\nA&M quarterback Kyle Allen completed 9-of-9 passes in the first quarter for 116 yards and two touchdowns.\nA&M employed a new wrinkle to get the ball in the hands of freshman receiver Christian Kirk. He took the direct snap twice in the first half, gaining a combined eight yards.\nBackup running back James White returned for the first time since suffering an undisclosed injury in the season opener against Arizona State.\nLinebacker Otaro Alaka (undisclosed) and receiver Jeremy Tabuyo (undisclosed) did not play. Receiver Speedy Noil missed his second straight game to what the SEC Network termed an ankle injury.\nTexas A&M 30, Mississippi State 17: Complete coverage\nClick here to visit the Texas A&M Aggies page\nHairopoulos: Sumlin breaks through vs. Top-25 team at home; A&M has bye to prepare for Bama\nTexas A&M quotable: Sumlin impressed with play of defensive ends; 'will address' Seals-Jones tweets during game\nTexas A&M quick hits: Seals-Jones catches 1st TD pass of season, gets ejected for targeting\nFive thoughts: No. 14 Texas A&M improves to 5-0 despite slow second half offensively\nPhotos: Kyle Allen, ground game carry A&M past Mississippi State 30-17\nKate Hairopoulos answers Texas A&M/SEC questions at 3 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 7; ask yours now\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/texas-quotable-sumlin-impressed-play-defensive-ends-will-address-seals-jones-tweets-game", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/hairopoulos-sumlin-breaks-vs-top-25-team-home-bye-prepare-bama", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-14-texas-improves-5-0-despite-slow-second-half-offensively-defeat-21-mississippi-state-30-17", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-quick-hits-seals-jones-catches-1st-td-pass-season-gets-ejected-targeting", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/chats/2015/09/30/kate-hairopoulos-answers-texas-amsec-questions-3-pm-wednesday-oct-7-ask-now"], "published": "2015-10-04T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:40:06.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
