There have been lawsuits for the development and also to block the evolution of new charter schools from being made. Advocates of charter schools share a belief that Pennsylvania State Representative Margo Davidson also shares. Rep. Davidson remarked “I know some folks are going to beat me up for supporting (charter schools) “But I still say every child has the right to education, regardless of their zip code. We cannot continue to [let] children that live in poverty have only one option.” Rep. Davidson made her comments while in attendance for the opening of the first charter school in the William Penn School District. The school is called Vision Academy. The counter to that claim would be to fight the Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, for equal funding to all school districts. Instead, we have the charter school solution, but there is one issue we all need to know, who is actually running our children’s charter schools?\nMost parents will be surprised that there are area charter schools in our own Commonwealth that are actually Muslim based religious schools that are listed as charter schools. Three schools are here in Pennsylvania and one in Philadelphia that recently closed. The name of Fethullah Gülen may not sound familiar, but his man has established over 100 charter schools in the United States Gülen’s name is familiar with the officials in the both the FBI and Homeland Security. He has made millions with his charter school empire. The Department of Homeland Security said of Gülen he is not an expert in education, but is “the leader of a large and influential religious and political movement with immense commercial holdings. In their written denial, U.S. attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security also stated a suspicion about CIA involvement in funding the Gülen Movement’s global projects. Gulen has been reported to have said, “You must move in the arteries of the system without anyone noticing your existence until you reach all the power centers. Until the conditions are ripe, they [the followers] must continue like this. If they do something prematurely, the world will crush our heads, and Muslims will suffer everywhere, like in the tragedies in Algeria, like in 1982 [in] Syria, like in the yearly disasters and tragedies in Egypt.The time is not yet right. You must wait for the time when you are complete and conditions.\"\nSince then, the FBI raided 19 Gulen schools in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio in 2014. WikiLeaks revealed in a document that the government is worried the schools are being used to indoctrinate the students and use money to fund the movement in Turkey. FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds believes Gülen is a threat to U.S. interests. In Pennsylvania there are 3 schools operating that are Gülen schools. They are, young Scholars of Central Pennsylvania Charter School, Young Scholars of Western Pennsylvania, and Young Scholars of McKeesport Charter School. One Gülen School in Philadelphia closed was Truebright Science Academy Charter School due mismanagement and poor performance in test scores. One former teacher filed a federal lawsuit alleging the school had engaged in a pattern of hiring, promoting, and paying less-qualified Turkish nationals more than American-born educators who were certified and had more experience. The former teacher reached a settlement with Truebright in 2013.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/world-13503361", "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/08/120-american-charter-schools-and-one-secretive-turkish-cleric/375923/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/opinion/fethullah-gulen-turkeys-eroding-democracy.html", "http://articles.philly.com/2015-05-17/news/62244659_1_truebright-brian-leinhauser-commonwealth-court", "http://www.phillytrib.com/metros/william-penn-district-opens-first-charter-school/article_5885b55e-4105-57ea-939f-2879563969f1.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:16:22.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
