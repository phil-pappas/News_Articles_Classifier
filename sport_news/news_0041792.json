McCollum is expected to start at shooting guard during his third NBA season.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers are confident enough in the Lehigh University graduate's ability to handle the expanded role that on Wednesday they exercised their fourth-year option on him.\nThe 6-foot-3, 190-pounder will earn $2,525,160 this season and $3,219,579 in 2016-17.\nMcCollum is expected to be an integral part of the Blazers' youth movement that includes at least a 60-percent roster shake-up from last year's playoff team.\nOnly point guard Damian Lillard is back from last season's starting lineup that got bounced by the Memphis Grizzlies from the NBA playoffs in the first round.\nMcCollum, the 10 t h overall pick in the June 2013 draft, averaged 6.8 points during the 2014-15 season. He then gave Portland fans a glimpse of the future by putting up 17 ppg. in the Memphis series. He averaged 25.7 points and 4.0 rebounds in the final three games against the Grizzlies.\nThe 24-year-old hasn't started regularly since his junior year at Lehigh, where he led coach Brett Reed's Mountains to the upset of national power Duke in the 2012 NCAA Tournament.\nHealth issues began the following year, when McCollum started 12 games before suffering a college-ending foot injury.\nThe start to McCollum's NBA rookie season was delayed when he broke a bone in his left foot in Oct. 2013, during training camp. His first NBA game came on Jan. 8, 2014.\nThe following season, the Ohio native missed a month after fracturing his right index finger in a Nov. 17, 2014, game against New Orleans.\nMcCollum headed into the 2015 training camp earlier this week as the starting shooting guard. He'll also see time as the backup point guard to Lillard.\nThe Blazers also exercised a fourth-year option on frontcourt player Mason Plumlee and a third-year option on fellow big man Noah Vonleh. All three team options are for the 2016-17 season.\nPlumlee, the 22 n d overall pick by the Brooklyn Nets in 2013, scored 19 points on 9-of-9 shooting and grabbed 12 rebounds for Duke in the 2012 NCAA Tournament loss to Lehigh. McCollum scored 30 points.\nThe Portland (Ore.) Oregonian contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:05:43.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
