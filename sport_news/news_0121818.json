Alma mater is the biggest pride anyone can have,\" Mukherjee said.\nAsked whether the age cheating mess has forced the rethink, Mukherjee said: \"We have full faith in the AIFF. I would like to put it this way that a school tournament will give a Nicolai Adam or a Stephen Constantine more options to choose from.\"\nThough the beverage giants are scheduled to have a meeting on October 8 with the AIFF to chalk out the format, it was learnt from insiders in the governing body that a ten-state proposal is being prepared starting from the district-level preliminary qualification in each state to the state round and finally the national leg where ten best schools from the ten states will vie for top honours.\n\"Top two teams from the zonals conducted in each state will play the state qualifier. From there the top team from every state will play in the national round. Coke is game for the format. We will have a formal meeting next Thursday,\" an AIFF official revealed.\nMeanwhile, it was also learnt that Coca Cola are willing to sponsor the expansive scouting programme that the AIFF has set up of late.\n\"There will be more spotters watching the matches this time. We are also in talks with the AIFF to create an even more pervasive scouting platform,\" informed Mukherjee when asked about this development.\nThis, if materializes, will be the second nationwide inter-school tournament after Subroto Cup, which is conducted by Indian Air Force. The Mir Iqbal Trophy is under the aegis of AIFF, and this will be the first time a school meet will be organised by the governing body.
