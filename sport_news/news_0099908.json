On the next play after the turnover, Brandon Vosbury raced 54 yards down the right sideline for a touchdown, and Timothy Hawley's extra point made it 14-0 midway through the second quarter. \nAnd the way SV's aggressive defense bottled up Lansing, it seemed clear those 14 points would be more than enough for the Sabers, who evened their record at 3-3. \n\"I think that was the start of the game for us,\" Manchester said the Sabers' second-quarter surge. \"It led things off and got us going.\" \nThat first touchdown was pivotal. SV faced a third-and-19 from Lansing's 22. Manchester stayed in the pocket for a second or two and then sprinted left. \n\"First, I took off and planned on running the ball,\" said Manchester, who rushed for 66 yards and threw for 37. \"Then I saw Zach break to the corner and just lobbed it up.\" \nAdded Knewasser: \"I had a designated route I had to break off when he scrambled and I found the (left) corner of the end zone.\" \nHawley's PAT made it 7-0 with 10:10 left in the quarter. \nThe Bobcats (2-4) moved the ball 15 yards on their next possession, but on third-and-5 Boothe looked right the whole way and Knewasser cut in front of a Lansing receiver near the sideline for an interception. \nOn the next play, Vosbury took a toss right, cut behind a vicious block from Justin Wheeler about 10 yards down field and continued down the right sideline for a touchdown as SV's lead grew to 14-0 6:22 before halftime. \nThe third quarter brought a 23-yard scoring run from Vosbury and a 3-yard touchdown run by Manchester, the latter allowing SV's starting unit to call it a day. \nKnewasser rushed for a game-high 133 yards, Vosbury had 125 on the ground and the Sabers finished with 362 rushing yards. \n\"With Zach being a senior on his last homecoming, it was a huge game for him,\" SV coach Mike Ford said. \"He was hitting the hole with a little extra explosion. He had an extra burst today.\" \nAs for the defense, its biggest stop came midway through the first quarter. The Bobcats moved the ball from their 38 to SV's 30, where they faced a fourth-and-1. Boothe tried to sneak for the yardage, but SV's interior defenders stuffed it for no gain. \nKyle Novobilski, Caleb Strong, Dan Sheridan and Patrick Mower all had sacks for SV. \nOn its final drive, Lansing scored on a 10-yard screen pass from Zach Detrick to Luke Winslow to cap the scoring. \nSV has a huge Division III game against Chenango Valley (5-1, 5-0) this coming Saturday. The Sabers, Windsor and Owego all have 2-2 divisional records and one of those teams will not qualify for the Class B playoffs. \n\"It is up in the air,\" Knewasser said of Class B playoff picture. \"It could go either way at this point. We have a big game coming up with CV next week. We have to buckle down.\" \nThe Bobcats will host two-time defending Class C state champion Chenango Forks in Week 7. \nOn Twitter: @PSBRob 14 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1LosQmp TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:21:12.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
