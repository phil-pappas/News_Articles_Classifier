Sullivan led the field from round one and had built a five-stroke lead as he entered the final round at the Oceanico Victoria course, which started late due to heavy overnight rain. He increased that margin by hitting five birdies for a flawless 5-under 66 to finish with a total of 23-under 261. Sullivan's nine-shot winning margin shattered the previous event record of three strokes by Alexander Levy from last season. It was the 28-year-old Sullivan's third European Tour win after victories at the South African Open and the Joburg Open earlier this year. \"Those two wins in South Africa were unbelievable, but to show your peers that you can do it in Europe as well is unbelievable\" Sullivan said. \"It's just what I wanted to do and it's just incredible.\" Fellow countryman Chris Wood finished second, followed one more stroke back by a three-way tie for third of Anthony Wall , Trevor Fisher Jr. and Eduardo de la Riva .
