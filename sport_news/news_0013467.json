Instead of using firecrackers, electronic crackers bought from Kolkata would be used on the occasion. The function that signifies victory of truth over evil will be held at Gandhi Maidan on October 22 at 5.30 pm.\nKamal Nopani, president of Shri Ramleela Mahotsav Evam Ravan Vadh Samaroh Samiti, said, \"We are introducing something new that Patnaites have not seen earlier. The electronic crackers are eco-friendly and through this initiative, we also want to spread the message of environment protection.\"\nTo make the event interesting, a revolving stage has been made from where Lord Ram, Laxman and Hanuman would burn the effigy of Ravan. Another interesting feature would be Hanuman, who would be kept 15 feet above the ground from where he will burn Lanka. The effigy of Ravan would be 70 feet high, Kumbhkaran 65 feet and that of Meghnath 60 feet high. The dialogues exchanged between Ram and Ravan during the war would be narrated by Ram Chatritar Das and Narhari Das. Two separate galleries for women have been made and the programme would be inaugurated by Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind. Nopani thanked the district administration for its full cooperation.\nKeeping in mind last year's stampede, the administration is leaving no stone unturned to make the event successful this time. Commissioner, Patna division, Anand Kishor said watch towers have been erected at all the gates and more than 50 CCTV cameras have been installed in and around Gandhi Maidan. Ambulances would be kept ready near all the gates for any emergency situation. \"We have made all arrangements for people to enjoy the event. Unlike previous year, we will have enough lights,\" Kishor said. He added that the PMCH and NMCH authorities have also been instructed to come up with 24X7 emergency control room from October 21 to October 30 keeping in mind Dussehra, Muharram and election.\nPatna SSP Vikas Vaibhav said more than 1,500 policemen would be deployed in and around Gandhi Maidan. \"There will be a police control room at the Gandhi Maidan and all the galleries would have separate loudspeaker,\" the SSP said. He urged people to inform the control room if they find anything suspicious. Vaibhav added that once the programme starts, no one would be allowed to enter inside and the gates would be opened for exit only.\nA dry run would be conducted on October 20, after which entry inside Gandhi Maidan would be prohibited till October 22 evening. Parking would not be allowed near Gandhi Maidan after 1pm on October 22. Visitors have been asked to park their vehicles at Shri Krishna Memorial Hall and A N Sinha Institute.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-19T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:32:40.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
