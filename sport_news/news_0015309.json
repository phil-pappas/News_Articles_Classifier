(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE With the Lions offense and defense struggling so far in 2015, the special teams unit has been under minimal scrutiny.\nBut, as if often the case on a struggling team, the Lions are losing many competitions in the kicking game. When players can’t be consistently relied upon to block or tackle on offense or defense, it’s hard to expect that to improve on special teams.\nThe Lions had four returns — three punts and one kickoff — nullified by penalty in Sunday’s 42-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals at Ford Field. Running back Ameer Abdullah fumbled on one kickoff, too, which led to punt returner TJ Jones handling both duties.\nFor a team struggling to move the ball as much as the Lions, field position is critical, and the team has to take advantage of its opportunities in the kicking game to help turn around this tumultuous start to the season.\nOverall, despite some good moves by Jones and Abdullah, the blocking units did not create enough opportunities in the return game, based on the coaches film from NFL Game Rewind.\nThe most consistent issue came on punt returns as the Lions blockers on the outside — cornerback Nevin Lawson and wide receiver Corey Fuller — struggled to slow Arizona’s gunners.\nOn the Cardinals’ first punt, Lawson hardly blocked cornerback Justin Bethel, who forced a fair catch by Jones. A holding penalty on Lions linebacker Josh Bynes forced the Lions to start at their 13.\nWith 2:08 left in the second quarter, TJ Jones gains 62 yards, but only after Brandon Copeland (circled in red) holds a defender to create an alley.   (Photo: NFL Game Pass) \nOn Arizona’s next punt, Lawson again struggled to stay in front of Bethel, who forced another fair catch. Meanwhile, on the other side, Fuller received a penalty for illegal use of hands, forcing the Lions to start at their 18.\nThe Lions allowed a 35-yard kickoff return to the Arizona 29 by rookie running back David Johnson later in the first quarter as Fuller missed a tackle at the 13.\nIn the second quarter, Abdullah had a 41-yard return to the Detroit 33 before he fumbled, though the Lions maintained possession. To gain those yards, Abdullah had to elude an Arizona player inside the 10.\nA major highlight by the special teams group was a 42-yard punt by Sam Martin that Lawson downed at the 1.\nJones had a 62-yard kickoff return later in the second quarter, but there were plenty of issues. Linebacker Brandon Copeland was flagged for holding, giving the Lions the ball at the Detroit 20 instead of the Arizona 27. For the long return, Jones had to evade one player at the Detroit 21 after running back\nZach Zenner missed a block, and after running laterally, he had to make another guy miss at the 22. Copeland’s block was the one that created an alley for Jones.\nWith 13:10 left in the third quarter, TJ Jones gains just 2 yards after Nevin Lawson (left circle) and Corey Fuller (right circle) miss their blocks.   (Photo: NFL Game Rewind) \nIn the second half, Jones had a 2-yard punt and was immediately tackled by wide receiver Brittan Golden, who beat Lawson. Bethel beat Fuller on the opposite side to be in position for the tackle.\nAlthough Lawson and Fuller need to block better, the coaches should recognize that they need help on the outside. Finally, in the fourth quarter, special teams coordinator Joe Marciano ordered some help with safety Don Carey assisting Fuller on one side and safety Isa Abdul-Quddus shadowing Lawson’s side. Carey was called for a holding on the first return where that happen, and even though it looked like a questionable call, the Lions started that drive at the 28, erasing Jones’ 10-yard return to the Detroit 40.\nThe best return play was Jones’ 34-yard kickoff return later in the fourth quarter.\nThen, on the next punt return, the Lions went back to leaving Lawson and Fuller alone, and Bethel ran by Lawson to force another fair catch by Jones at 12. And, because everyone had a role in the loss, Jones misplayed the final punt and let it bounce at the 31 before the Cardinals downed it at the 14.\nTo their credit, the Lions did mostly well in coverage as Johnson’s 35-yarder was the only kickoff return for Arizona, and Patrick Peterson’s 10-yarder was the long punt return. But with so many miscues in the return game, it’s hard to say the Lions won the special teams battle.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com\ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:47:32.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
