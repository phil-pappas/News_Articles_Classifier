That’s not really true,” she told a Washington audience when asked about India not being part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, of which India is not a part.\n“We are very actively engaged in ARSEP (Asean Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) which consists of ASEAN and ASEAN FTA countries.\nSo we actually in ARSEP are moving faster along with other members,” Sitharaman said during a panel discussion on India-US economic ties organised by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a top American think tank. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:12:31.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
