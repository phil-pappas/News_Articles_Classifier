There had been mounting speculation that the Ravens, who are 1-5, could consider trading their top receiver to a team in postseason contention.\n\"That's the first I've heard that one,\" Harbaugh said following Friday's practice. \"There's no chance of that. I wouldn't part with him.\"\nSmith, who has already announced his intention to retire after this season, the 15th of his career, made it clear that he's not interested in a trade either.\n\"If they would trade me, I would quit,\" Smith said \"I like to finish what I started.\"\nSmith currently leads the Ravens with 36 catches for 510 yards and three touchdowns. His play, along with the Ravens' struggles, has resulted in talk that the 36-year-old could delay retirement and return in 2016 to play out the final year of his contract.\nHowever, Smith said Wednesday that he's still \"on schedule\" to retire and he's more focused on helping the Ravens finish the year strong.\nAsked Friday whether he'd consider trying to talk Smith into returning for another year, Harbaugh said, \"We've got a game Monday night and he's got to be here Monday night. I promise you that and for every game after that.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:25:15.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
