Some rivals have dismissed their breathtaking championship run with a wave of the hand and a snort. \nThe Warriors just got lucky, they said. They were able to stay mostly healthy for the entire grueling season, avoiding the big injuries that plagued so many other contenders, both in the regular season and in the playoffs. \nConsidering the stack of injuries that ruined some seasons, keeping 15 players healthy should be viewed as a tremendous accomplishment, not just a random gift from the basketball gods. \nAs the NBA prepares to tip off the regular season on Tuesday, the biggest issue facing a league on the upswing may not be labor strife or the age limit for draft eligibility. After a season in which star after star missed huge chunks of time, one of the biggest priorities is player health. \n\"I think what we saw in this season and in the playoffs, especially, is there is no question that injuries had a big impact on the competition,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \"Not that that's anything new. One of the things we're looking at as a league is what can we do to keep players on the floor?\" \nThe numbers last year were staggering. Eight players on the NBA's list of most popular-selling jerseys missed at least 15 percent of the 82 regular season games, including LeBron James (13 games missed), Blake Griffin (15), Derrick Rose (31) and Russell Westbrook (15). \nKevin Durant (55), Carmelo Anthony (42), Dwight Howard (41), Paul George (76) and Kobe Bryant (47) are among the stars who missed at least half the season and seven of the top 10 draft picks — not including Philadelphia's Dario Saric, who played in Europe — missed significant time with injuries. \nInjuries to Cleveland stars Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving in the playoffs hampered the Cavaliers' ability to hang with the Warriors in the finals, while the Miami Heat (Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh missed 58 games combined) and Oklahoma City Thunder (Westbrook, Durant and Serge Ibaka missed 88 games) did not make the playoffs for the first time in years due mostly to their missing stars. \n_ From overtraining at the AAU level to poor sleep patterns developed during the season's unforgiving travel schedule, the theories are many as to the number of injuries. And efforts are coming on all fronts to address the scourge. \nThe NBA appointed Dr. John DiFiori as the league's director of sports medicine, partnered with GE Healthcare to research musculoskeletal injuries and formed a board of physicians around the league to examine the issue. The league also changed the schedule to drastically reduce the number of back-to-backs and stretches of four games in five nights in hopes of easing some of the stress on players' bodies. \nThe NBA Players' Association hired Joe Rogowski, a well-regarded strength coach and athletic trainer, as its new sports science guru. \nAnd teams across the league are revamping their training and medical staffs and building new practice facilities to try to cater to player health. \nThe Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons have all brought in new medical and/or training personnel while the Wolves have partnered with the world-renowned Mayo Clinic to open a $25 million practice center that includes a chef on site to prepare healthy meals and a sports medicine wing with MRI machines and physicians available for immediate consultation. \n\"I think it's still too early to say this is why these injuries are happening,\" Rogowski said. \"But we are doing our due diligence. There are so many variables that are involved with injuries. So being able to look at all the different variables and not just one thing is very important.\" \nSilver is pushing teams to share more on what methods and technologies they are using to combat injuries. Some teams consider that proprietary and are reluctant to give it. \n\"I don't want to see our teams just competing in terms of best practices when it comes to the health and welfare of the players,\" Silver said. \"Teams can learn from each other and can apply it to the league as a whole. As you heard (Warriors coach) Steve Kerr say, as great as it is to win, you want to win with both teams best players on the floor.\" \nIt's a good line, but one that may fall on deaf ears when presented to hyper-competitive teams looking for any edge. \n\"The league feels like it's a priority, but it's a little interesting,\" Dallas Mavericks head athletic trainer Casey Smith said. \"Every team is their own entity. There are many of us that do share best practices quite often on all levels and there are some, frankly, that don't. That's their decision.\" \nSmith has kept the Mavericks at the forefront of sports science technology for years, teaming with coach Rick Carlisle and owner Mark Cuban to aggressively examine ways to keep their players healthy. From sleep studies to biomechanics and GPS tracking technology, the Mavericks are throwing everything they have at one of the league's fundamental problems. \nWhile they have embraced the need for players to rest during the season, Smith said it's also important to make sure a resting player gets in a hard workout on his \"off day.\" Dirk Nowitzki may not do the cutting, accelerating and decelerating and physical contact that he does during a game, but he will go through a weightlifting and cardio workout so that his body remains in \"active recovery.\" \n\"Although we may limit them from the court at times, we still very much expect some type of demand on their bodies to keep them at that highest threshold,\" Smith said, \"which I think surprises people sometimes.\" \nSmith is a big believer in studying movement patterns and trying to reduce the biomechanical asymmetry that can put greater stress on joints and muscles. That also requires athletes to do the same, often tedious, warmups and exercises every day to foster the needed muscle memory. \nTimberwolves president Flip Saunders coaxed long-time Pistons physical therapist Arnie Kander out of retirement after enduring a season when 10 of his players missed significant time because of injuries. Kander spent more than two decades in Detroit and gained a reputation for using unusual methods and contraptions to help keep players healthy. \n\"When you have four or five of your best players out, the game is less,\" Kander said. \"I'm a basketball fan. I happen to work in the NBA. So I like to see a better game.\" \n-- Jon Krawczynski \nUncertainty and edginess for Thunder star Durant \nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — It's still the preseason, and Kevin Durant already is tired of answering questions. Well, at least, certain questions. \nTake this interview session after a preseason win over Denver, for example: Durant missed most of last season for the Thunder with a broken right foot that required three surgeries. After scoring 23 points and playing nine minutes more than his previous preseason high, the 2014 MVP repeatedly was asked how he felt. \n\"You played more than 30 minutes, you played into the fourth quarter,\" someone asked. \"How was that for you?\" \n\"It wasn't the first time,\" Durant replied. \"It felt good, though.\" \n\"Kevin, how antsy are you for the regular season?\" went another question. \"Is the progression — are you ready to go, or do you still need the two weeks.\" \nDurant rolled his eyes, hesitated, then responded: \"Next question.\" \n\"Is this the best you've felt? I mean, you look ...\" \n\"Next question.\" \nDurant laughed and elaborated briefly on the third question, but the responses offer a snapshot of an increasingly visible part of the four-time scoring champion's personality. Durant's openness during his MVP speech 18 months ago won him accolades across the country. He's still that man — still engaging, humble and selfless — but now there is a pronounced edginess to this NBA superstar, even occasional defensiveness. \nMuch of the certainty Durant has known throughout his career is gone. For the previous half decade, Durant's seasons were easy to predict. He'd be in the race for the scoring title and the MVP award, he'd be among the league leaders in minutes and his Oklahoma City Thunder would be in the title hunt. \nThose things likely will be true again this season, but there are more external factors than usual this time. He'll be a free agent after this season, and rampant speculation from the media about where he might land has driven him to the point of calling people out. After building a reputation as one of the league's ironmen, he's faced a barrage of questions about his readiness, a tough pill for a man who missed just 16 regular-season games in his first seven NBA seasons. \nTeammate Russell Westbrook emerged as an MVP-caliber player and scoring champion in Durant's absence, and some wonder if two potential MVPs can co-exist. To top it off, he has a new coach in Billy Donovan, who has never coached in the NBA. \nSo the questions fly. People want answers, and in some cases, the soft-spoken Durant doesn't have them. \nDurant, of course, would rather let his game do the talking. This preseason, he averaged 18 points in five games and shot 59 percent from the field, including 57 percent from 3-point range. \nAfter Durant unleashed an unusually vicious dunk against Fenerbahce Ulker's Jan Vesely, Westbrook declared him ready. \n\"That just shows that he's back to his normal self, and that he's back to dominating and back to doing what he do,\" Westbrook said. \nThroughout the preseason, Durant has driven hard to the basket, closed out on defense, gone up strong for rebounds and has had no problem with contact or going to the floor — all signs of a player who isn't scared or worried. \n\"I never want to live in fear,\" he said. \"I love the game so much, so if anything were to happen again, I'd have to live with it. I think if I would have went out there with doubt in my mind, something would happen. I was always taught, no matter what, if I'm on the court, I'm all right.\" \nHe likes Donovan, though he's quick to point out that the whole team has to get familiar with the new coach. \n\"It's been fun,\" Durant said. \"I enjoy him. Great basketball mind, but more so, a better person. We've hit it off since the beginning. Just excited to play for him.\" \nWestbrook said sharing the ball with Durant would be a non-issue. \n\"It's easy,\" Westbrook said. \"We've been playing together for eight years. It's not rocket science. It's something that we're used to doing. We've been playing with each other for a very long time. We know how to get each other going and we know how to find our rhythm.\" \nAs for his future, Durant is focused solely on what is ahead — this season in Oklahoma City. \n\"I just enjoy the game of basketball,\" he said. \"I enjoy these wonderful fans here, and I just want to give them the best version of me that I can.\" \nDurant isn't offering bold declarations about what he, or the Thunder, will do this year. He's not worried that some feel the Thunder have lost ground to Golden State, San Antonio, the Los Angeles Clippers and Houston in the Western Conference. \n\"Radars and projections and comparisons — that really don't matter to me,\" he said. \"That's not my job. My job is to go out there and work as hard as I can every single day and try to be the best leader and the best teammate I can be.\" \n-- Cliff Brunt \nMavericks waive Dalembert, three others with season opener near \nDALLAS (AP) — The Mavericks have waived center Samuel Dalembert and three others as they trim their roster to get ready for the regular season. \nThe 34-year-old Dalembert spent the 2013-14 season with the Mavericks, who decided to leave him out of the mix as a backup to Zaza Pachulia. Dallas traded for Pachulia after DeAndre Jordan changed his mind in free agency and stayed with the Los Angeles Clippers. \nDalembert has career averages of 7.7 points and 7.8 rebounds in 13 seasons. \nThe Mavericks also waived Brandon Ashley, Jamil Wilson and Tu Holloway on Saturday, putting their roster one above the maximum of 15. Holloway signed with Dallas two days earlier and didn't appear in the preseason. \nDallas opens the season Wednesday at Phoenix. \nWarriors coach Kerr to miss opener with bad back \nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr will miss the season opener as he continues to recover from back surgery. \nGeneral manager Bob Myers told reporters Saturday that interim coach Luke Walton will coach the team for the season opener against New Orleans on Tuesday night in Oakland. Kerr will be on hand for the banner-raising ceremony but is not ready to take back the coaching duties. \nKerr has been sidelined since the opening week of training camp because of complications from offseason back surgery. The Warriors do not know when he will be healthy enough to return. The Warriors won the NBA title last season in Kerr's first season as coach. \nClippers waive Hayes \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — The Clippers have waived center-power forward Chuck Hayes, who signed with the team nearly two months ago. The move was announced Saturday. \nHe averaged 0.5 points and 2.5 rebounds in four preseason games with the team. The roster stands at 15 heading into the Clippers' season opener next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:32:10.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
