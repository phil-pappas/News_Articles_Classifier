A brief off-season then takes place before the players return to tournaments in the first week of January to start another grueling campaign.\nMartin Navratilova, winner of 59 grand slam titles, said it was too long.\n\"I still think overall we see the number of injuries and withdrawals is still too high,\" she told reporters on Monday.\n\"Maybe it's great to have all these tournaments, but at the end of the day, if you don't have enough players playing, you got a problem.\n\"So I still think for me it probably would be the length of the calendar that's a longâ€‘term project. I was talking about that 35, 30 years ago. The season is too long.\"\nIn Sunday's WTA Finals opener Romanian Halep thumped U.S. Open champion Flavia Pennetta 6-0 6-3. The Italian was likely to have been fatigued after a hectic recent playing itinerary including China and Moscow in a desperate bid to qualify for Singapore.\nSimon said he was unsure how he would change the schedule following the U.S. Open in September but said it was necessary.\n\"The players are tired coming out of the U.S Open. It's been a long season and they've played a lot of tennis,\" he said.\n\"Then you exacerbate it when you have a compelling race that's forcing them to play even more to try and get here.\n\"What we do with it is the $99 question that we have to resolve and figure out how to do it. But we do need to address that.\"\n(Editing by Rex Gowar )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:50:35.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
