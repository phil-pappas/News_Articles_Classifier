He speaks at a news conference early Friday morning.\nThe man believed to have shot and killed at least nine other people at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg on Thursday morning was not treated at the nearest hospital, Mercy Medical Center , officials there said.\nThe hospital received 10 patients, one of whom died, the chief medical officer, Dr. Jason Gray, said at a news conference early Friday morning. The hospital has not released the names or ages of any patients it admitted.\nSome people brought to Mercy Medical Center following Thursday morning's mass shooting were treated and released, and four were taken into surgery, Gray said.\nOf those receiving surgery, one has been released and another was expected to be discharged later Friday, he said. The other two patients who underwent surgery are stable, though one remains in critical condition.\nThree patients taken to Mercy Medical Center were later moved to hospitals providing a higher level of care, hospital CEO Kelly Morgan said.\nMercy Medical Center regularly provides trauma care, including for gunshot victims, but it does not provide neurological or cardiovascular surgery, Morgan said. The hospital treats 50,000 patients in its emergency department annually.\n\"I can assure you our team was ready, they were prepared and there was compassion,\" Morgan said.\nHospital staff train monthly for mass casualty events, he said, and many received their medical training through Umpqua Community College.\n\"I can assure you that every single person out here will be impacted by what happened at UCC,\" said Gray, the hospital's chief medical officer. \"Yesterday was a challenging day. But the days and weeks to come will be the most challenging. It will be a long period of grieving.\"\nThe hospital has made mental health care available to its staff and the wider community, officials said. A blood drive was planned for later Friday .\n-- Carli Brosseau\ncbrosseau@oregonian.com\n503-294-5121; @carlibrosseau", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/carlibrosseau", "http://www.mercyrose.org/"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:03:05.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
