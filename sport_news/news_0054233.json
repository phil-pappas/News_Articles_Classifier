But will these suspensions bring an end to a crisis that's shaken world football? \nA new low for football's governing body with the suspension of its leadership. The decision by the FIFA Ethics Committee to suspend Sepp Blatter, Michel Platini, and Jerome Valcke -- so as to investigate corruption claims was expected -- but no less dramatic. And once again underlined the sense of crisis within the organization. \n\"This today is one of the biggest news in FIFA history. A couple of months or even weeks ago, nobody could have imagined that Blatter has to leave his office, but that is exactly what is going on now. He has to leave the FIFA headquarter. But today is a day for hope as well. Today we have hope for FIFA,\" Journalist Tim Rohn said. \nThis is just the latest controversy for FIFA. In May, US authorities indicted 14 FIFA officials and associates on bribery and racketeering charges. A separate Swiss investigation also probed the bidding process of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. That though, did not stop Blatter from being re-elected as President. \n\"I'm not perfect, nobody's perfect, but we will do a good job together, I'm sure, so I thank you so much. I thank you for the trust and confidence, the trust and confidence, together we go. Let's go FIFA. Let's go FIFA. Let's go FIFA. Thank you,\" Blatter said. \nBut just four days later, Blatter announced he would stand down in February. \nThe decision did little to dampen the controversy. In July, a comedian showered Blatter with money ahead of a news conference. Last month, events took a more serious twist as Swiss authorities opened criminal proceedings against the 79-year-old. \nIt has been a turbulent few months for football's governing body. The crisis has now extended to the heart of FIFA's leadership. And there are some now questioning whether the upcoming Presidential Election should be allowed to proceed. Platini's suspension puts the Frenchman's hopes of becoming FIFA President in doubt. While another presidential candidate, Chung Mong-Joon, is now banned from the sport. Cameroon's Issa Hayatou -- the President of the Africa's football federation -- is in temporary charge of FIFA. His job is to bring a sense of integrity back to the organization -- but that is a sizeable task -- amid a crisis he knows is far from over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:11:42.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
