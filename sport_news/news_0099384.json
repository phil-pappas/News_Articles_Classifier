K-State hosts Oklahoma on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. RELATED ARTICLE O-line takes step forward against TCU Losing a game like Kansas State did last Saturday has a tendency to stick on one’s craw a while, but one positive in digging through the aftermath is the play of the Wildcats’ offensive line against a very good TCU team. \nFaced with a potential game-breaking decision on fourth-and-1 last Saturday night, Kansas State coach Bill Snyder went for the points. Two days later, Snyder admitted he’d had second thoughts about his decision to kick a field goal. \nTwo games. Two halftime leads. Two losses. \nThat’s not the kind of math Kansas State wants to see as it nears the midway point of the football season. \nYet that’s exactly where the Wildcats are right now, coming off a pair of tough losses — at Oklahoma State and at home to TCU — with 19th-ranked Oklahoma up next this Saturday for a 2:30 p.m. kick at Bill Snyder Family Stadium. \n“We were angry after that OSU loss because that was a tough loss coming down to the wire, and (the TCU loss) just adds fuel to the fire,” K-State quarterback Joe Hubener said. “We’re tired of losing these tough games because we know that we can play with anybody, and we showed that. \n“TCU is a great team and we played with them the whole game. We fully expect OU to come in here prepared, but we want this win.” \nWanting it and doing, though, are two different things and something clearly isn’t working in the second halves of games. The Wildcats blew an eight-point lead in Stillwater, Okla., and then watched an 18-point lead on TCU disappear last Saturday. Until it’s loss at Oklahoma State, the Wildcats had won 49 straight games when leading at halftime. \n“We’re not going to panic over it, but we’re doing as much research as we possibly can,” K-State head coach Bill Snyder said of the second-half meltdowns. “Is there anything that we should be doing different than what we’re doing? Part of it is a matter of emphasis, part of it is a way we might approach any changes we make in the second half and a variety of different things. \n“For the most part — I know this is a pad answer — but it’s a matter of execution, as it relates to offense, defense, the kicking game and coaching, what we put on the field. So, all of that has an impact on it.” \nThe third quarters, in particular, have been especially troublesome for K-State (3-2, 0-2 Big 12) in recent weeks. On the season, K-State has scored just 16 combined points in the third quarter through five games. At Oklahoma State, the Wildcats ran 14 plays and totaled just 1 yard of offense. K-State was outscored 16-6 in the second half. \nLast week, after putting together its best offensive first half of the season — including a clock-chewing 165 rushing yards — the Wildcats laid an egg in the third quarter. TCU scored 14 unanswered points in the period, while K-State seemed to abandon the game plan that staked the Wildcats to the big halftime lead. \n“Our first halves are going so well,” Risner said. “We need to come out, stick to what we did in the first half and see how that goes, not try to switch that up when the defense changes. Lets try to do what we did in the first half first and carry it throughout the whole game.” \nOnly four of the first 15 plays of the third quarter were rushes, as Hubener completed just 1 of 11 passes for 17 yards. The Wildcats turned the ball over their first possession of the half when the first-year starter threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown. K-State then punted on its next three possessions. \nThe Wildcats didn’t finally revisit the running game until the end of the third quarter — a drive that carried over into the fourth and was exclusively on the ground — capped by a 1-yard TD run by Hubener to give K-State a 42-31 lead. \nRisner said the Jekyll and Hyde offense comes from the Wildcats not yet having an identity on offense, now in Week 6. \n“I don’t know that we have a real identity — like Stanford is, smashing the ball down the field — and K-State has been one of those teams before, but with a new offense, so many new guys, new quarterback and new center, we’re all longing to find that identity, what we’re known for and can stick to,” Risner said. \n“We don’t know what we do well yet, maybe.” \nK-State is 10 points from being an undefeated team. The Wildcats had the nation’s second-ranked team on the ropes a week ago. Risner said that makes the losing all more frustrating because the Wildcats have talent, but he thinks they just haven’t figured out to put it all together in a single game yet. \n“It’s the most frustrating thing,” he said. “We’ve got all these pieces of the puzzle, we’re scoring touchdowns, doing some good things every week. But finish is the big word. We just need to finish.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:32:45.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
