Novotny's first of two TD runs opened up the scoring for the Lancers. \n\"We were just having our way with them. The line was coming off of the ball hard,\" said Novotny. \nLakeland quickly capitalized off of their momentum forcing a three and out and taking a two score lead less than a minute later. Michael Rossi's 52-yard touchdown run with 7:50 to go in the first quarter was a statement of the strength of the Lakeland team as a whole after he forced his way through two would be tacklers to take the rock to the house. \n\"Our goal is to run the ball and run hard. In the long run we're going to need the run,\" said McCormack. \nDefensively the Lancers were just as stout forcing two first half turnovers and allowing just three first downs. The Demarest offense proceeded to muster up just 50 yards of total offense in the first half against the Lakeland defense. \n\"They took the ball out of their hands. They played hard defense,\" said McCormack. \nThe defensive effort helped set up Lakeland on a shortened field for their third score of the game after the first of two interceptions by Jake Catalioto. Quarterback Danny Mullin's two-yard rushing touchdown put the Lancers up 21-0 as they headed into the end of the first quarter. \nUtilizing the same formula that gave them the commanding first quarter lead the Lancers would add three more scores in the second quarter to bury Demarest at 42-0. \nTouchdowns by Novotny (81 yards), Kelvin Gonzalez (8 yards) and Imbasciani (31-Yard Reception) gave the Lancers offense an efficiency of 85% having scored on six of their seven drives for the half. The team finished up with 279 yards of total offense for the first half. \nLakeland cruised to a 42-14 victory electing to play most of their junior varsity unit for the second half with a running clock. The Lancers victory improved the team to 3-2 on the season as they look to continue their winning ways against Passaic Valley next Friday night. \n\"[We need to] stay focused, work hard, keep our mind on our goal of a State Championship,\" said Novotny.
