Related Articles 2015 High school football rankings 2015 High School Football region standings (VIDEO) Player of the Week: Watson's climb leading Dawson back to top 5 things: What we learned from Week 7 of high school football \nArea teams continue to fight for their postseason lives this week, as the high school football campaign closes in on the stretch run. \nThe race for Region 7-AAA remains full of intrigue, and this weekend will provide fans with a good deal of insight as to how the chase for the playoffs and region crown will play out -- or it could descend into chaos. \nBanks County (4-2, 1-1 Region 7-AAA) is coming off a bye week knowing that victory on Friday over visiting Lumpkin County (2-5, 0-3) would put the Leopards in prime position for a postseason slot -- in fact it could even keep Banks in the region title race, depending on the region’s other outcomes this Friday. \nThe Indians are struggling in region play so far but know that they are by no means out of contention, and with standout Zach Matthews getting more and more carries, they could prove tough to stop. The showdown will be broadcast live on WDUN FM 102.9. \nElsewhere in 7-AAA, region leader Dawson County (4-2, 3-0) will travel to Fannin County (3-3, 1-1), looking to maintain its spot atop the standings. The Tigers and Rebels each feature explosive offenses and plenty of young talent in what should be an exciting contest that will be broadcast on northgeorgiasportslink.com. Also in 7-AAA West Hall (2-4, 0-2) will play host to Franklin County (3-3, 2-1) looking to gain some traction against a Lions team that needs a win to stay near the top of the region race. \n7-AAA program East Hall (2-4, 2-1) will also compete non-region this week, taking on Johnson (2-5) in a cross-county battle that will be broadcast live on WDUN AM 550. The young Vikings have found their rhythm in region play and would love another win to keep things rolling once they get back into 7-AAA competition next week. The Knights, meanwhile, would love to notch their second win in three contests. \nWhile the race in 7-AAA is full of possibilities, Gainesville will look for a win at Clarke Central to help squelch any thoughts of chaos in Region 8- in a game broadcast live on 1240 AM ESPN Radio. The Red Elephants (4-2, 4-1 Region 8- ) are coming off a razor-thin 16-8 loss to region leader Lanier and are tied for second in 8- with Loganville. Gainesville needs to bounce back in order to keep pace at the top of the standings and will face a Gladiators (2-4, 2-3) team coming off a 28-21 defeat to Flowery Branch last week. The Falcons stayed right in the playoff hunt with the road win and will look to maintain their winning ways against winless Apalachee on Friday. Elsewhere, Salem (4-2, 3-2) hosts Loganville (6-1, 5-1) in an intriguing battle, while Winder-Barrow will battle Cedar Shoals (1-5, 1-4) in a game the Bulldoggs (3-3, 3-2) must win to stay in the hunt. \nPerhaps the most intriguing showdown of the night will take place in Tiger, where rivals and Class AA top 10 foes Rabun County and Union County will face off for supremacy in Region 8-AA. The sixth-ranked Panthers (7-0, 3-0 Region 8-AA) and Wildcats (6-1, 3-0) feature plenty of playmakers, and last season’s contest proved thrilling indeed, as Rabun pulled away in the fourth quarter for the win. Also, Region 8-AAAA sees Stephens County (5-1, 3-0 Region 8-AAAA) look to keep pace with Buford when it plays host to Chestatee (0-6, 0-3). The Wolves (5-1, 3-0) meanwhile, will play host to Monroe Area (2-4, 1-2). North Hall (2-4, 1-2) will also look to bounce back at Madison County (1-5, 1-2) after suffering a loss to Buford last week. And, in a game broadcast live on wrwh.com, White County (1-5, 1-2) will head to North Oconee (2-3, 2-1) after a 21-20 loss to Stephens County last week. \nIt will be another huge week, and the stations of Jacobs Media (WDUN and ESPN Radio) and AccessWDUN.com’s Friday Game Night page will be on hand to have every angle covered. \nWEEK 8 AREA HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL SCHEDULE, OCT. 16 Apalachee at Flowery Branch Dawson County at Fannin County -- Radio: northgeorgiasportslink.com East Hall at Johnson -- Radio: WDUN 550 AM Franklin County at West Hall Gainesville at Clarke Central -- Radio: 1240 AM ESPN Radio Habersham Central at Centennial Hart County at Jackson County Heritage, Conyers at Lanier Lakeview Academy at Athens Academy Lumpkin County at Banks County -- Radio: WDUN 102.9 FM Monroe Area at Buford North Forsyth at Johns Creek North Hall at Madison County Oglethorpe County at Riverside Military Providence Christian at Commerce Towns County Prince Avenue Christian Union County at Rabun County Winder-Barrow at Cedar Shoals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:09:25.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
