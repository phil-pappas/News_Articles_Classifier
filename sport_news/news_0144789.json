And strong. More From KTVZ.COM Tennis' teenage 'pit bull' targets glory \nVenus Williams won her biggest title in five years Saturday, clinching the final in Wuhan when Wimbledon runner-up Garbine Muguruza retired with an ankle injury trailing 6-3 3-0. \nEarlier this week, Williams' younger sister, Serena, said she would skip the WTA Finals -- or year-end championships -- to \"heal\" after a draining season that saw the world No. 1 almost complete the rare calendar-year grand slam. \nBut Venus' victory over the Spaniard means the seven-time grand slam winner is expected to rise to eighth place in the race to qualify for Singapore, which begins October 25th. The top eight qualify, although Serena's withdrawal ensures that the ninth-place finisher in the calendar-year standings will also make the field in tennis' fifth most prestigious event. \nVenus Williams survived slugfests against Johanna Konta and Roberta Vinci the previous two days -- Vinci was the player who stunned Serena Williams at the U.S. Open -- to make the final in Wuhan. \nAt 35, her body held up more than the 21-year-old Muguruza's. \nMuguruza, however, is expected to climb to fifth in the calendar-year standings, significantly boosting her chances of appearing at the WTA Finals for the first time. \nMore points are on offer at this week's China Open, the last big women's tournament ahead of Singapore. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
