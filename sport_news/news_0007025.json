They’re No. 7 in total defense, giving up just 260.2 yards a game and No. 8 in scoring defense, allowing only 12.4 points a game. \n“Those guys are playing well; they’re flying around,” second-year coach Bryan Harsin said earlier this week as the Broncos (4-1, 1-0 Mountain West) prepared for Saturday’s game at CSU (2-3, 0-1 MW). “It starts up front, but I like the mentality that we have on that side of the ball.” \nIt starts up front, Harsin said, with a seven-man rotation at the three defensive line positions that includes five seniors and two juniors. Behind them is a talented group of linebackers, led by the most valuable player of last year’s Fiesta Bowl win over Arizona, Tanner Vallejo. \nCSU VS.

But this year’s unit might be the best yet. \n“When I was the offensive coordinator here (2006-12), no one appreciated them more than I did, because I know how we won games,” Harsin said. “I know the turnovers, I know the field position. I knew all those things that we took advantage of as an offensive team, and it was all because of our defense.” \n•The Broncos have gone 1112-11 in league play over the past 16 years, winning two titles in the Big West (1999, 2000), eight in the Western Athletic (2002-06, 2008-10) and two in the Mountain West (2012 and 2014) conferences. \n•Boise State quarterback Brett Rypien, a true freshman, set a Washington state record for career passing yards with 13,044 at Shadle Park High School in Spokane. He broke his uncle Mark Rypien’s Greater Spokane League record of 4,965 passing yards by the end of his junior year. Mark Rypien was the MVP of Super Bowl XXVI with the Washington Redskins. \nFollow reporter Kelly Lyell at twitter.com/KellyLyell and facebook.com/KellyLyell.news Read or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1Ryj6Xz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:28:23.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
