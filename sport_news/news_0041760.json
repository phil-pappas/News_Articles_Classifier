Midway through the fourth quarter, the Pittsburgh Steelers came out on the field in a three-wide receiver set. Instantly, Harmon flashed back to the first quarter. In that earlier play, Darrius Heyward-Bey had streamed down the left sideline while the tight end and receiver on the right side of the field went toward the middle of the field. Here in the fourth quarter, the Steelers were trying to run a similar play. When the ball was snapped, Harmon, who started on the right side of the field, sprinted to his left as Ben Roethlisberger wound up to throw. By the time the ball descended from the air, the safety came down with the interception. “It was a play earlier in that game. Similar field position, everything was real similar,” Harmon said. “The great safeties, they recognize. They might see something earlier and if it comes up again, they’ll be right there to make a play on it.” Safety is a position that doesn’t always register on the stat sheet. It’s requires preparation and communication. And sometimes, if you do your job correctly, it means an opposing quarterback throws a short pass instead of testing your secondary deep. There’s no way to calculate that in a box score. What Harmon did in Week One was a perfect example of a safety using his brainpower to make an impact in the game. It’s one thing that makes Devin McCourty, Harmon’s mentor, great. In his third season with the Patriots, Harmon is starting to catch on. “Being under Dev and even having that year under Steve Gregory my rookie year. Having those two players — smart and intelligent players, great football players — it just helped me,” Harmon said. “Being out there now, I’m just not out there playing football. I’m being in the game. I’m trying to find different matchups, trying to see where maybe I need to shade to or maybe where I need to help. Things like that, which have made me a better football player.” Through three games this season, Harmon has played 98 snaps, 48.5 percent of the defensive total. At this point last year, the safety had only played 44 defensive snaps. In order to make more of an impact this season, Harmon went to the film room. Not only did the 24-year-old watch more film of himself and other teams, he studied McCourty. Harmon doesn’t have McCourty’s kind of speed, but he aims to approach each play in similar fashion. Harmon’s goal was to see each play as his teammate would. The safety analyzed matchups and plays to gain the kind of knowledge that lets the safety know which direction to run when the ball is snapped. “Things like that really help you kind of figure out where you think the ball is going to be going and where you can go to help. Like the corners on deep routes and who you can help,” Harmon said. “Really just matching up and knowing who is where. That’s really a testament to Devin, just studying him and being under him and learning the game of football from a great safety standpoint.” This season, the extra work has been evident on the field. Not only is Harmon receiving more playing time, his play is sticking out. He has more interceptions (two) in three games than Cleveland, Jacksonville, New Orleans, Seattle and Washington have as teams through four games. McCourty said he’s noticed Harmon’s preparation paying off. “For him, it’s just a continuous growth in watching film, seeing things, and now the game starts to slow down. You get to see things in advance,” McCourty said. “I think it’s enabled him to make more plays. Even sometimes with a limited number of plays out there on the field, but still having a huge impact on the overall defense. I thought he’s done a good job of just being ready to take advantage of plays.” Part of Harmon’s development comes from more playing time. It’s one thing to learn in practice or in the film room and another to experience those things in real time during a game. Those moments when he wasn’t playing a lot weren’t easy, but it makes a start like he’s having now taste that much sweeter. “It’s a constant grind. It can be frustrating,” Harmon said. “I mean, we all come from different colleges where we played a lot of football and were all starting, but coming in here, especially a competitive team like this. It’s been a struggle with just telling myself, 'Just keep preparing like you’re the starter,' and doing things like that. But it’s all working out for the best and I’m excited to see where it’s going to go.” By Mark Daniels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:07:30.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
