The UAW said local union leaders will meet Wednesday in Detroit to vote on the tentative agreement. If they approve it, GM's U.S. hourly workers will vote on it.\nThe agreement covers 52,600 U.S. auto workers at 62 GM facilities in the U.S.\nUAW President Dennis Williams said the proposed deal will provide \"long-term, significant wage gains and job security benefits now and in the future.\" The union also hinted that this agreement — like a contract passed last week by Fiat Chrysler workers — gradually will eliminate a much-hated two-tier wage system in the plants.\nGM said in a statement that the agreement benefits employees but still provides flexibility to the company. The company said it would not comment further until the agreement is ratified.\nThe union told GM on Saturday that it would terminate its contract just before midnight Sunday. The UAW made a similar strike threat in discussions with Fiat Chrysler, but negotiators also were able to avoid a walkout then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:05:35.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
