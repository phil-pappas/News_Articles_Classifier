(Photo by Jerry Markland/Getty Images) Jimmie Johnson has had more than one interesting exchange this year with Twitter haters, including one back in August who called the six-time Sprint Cup Series champion \"washed up.\"\nAdChoices At least one of the haters showed up on Twitter on Monday, a day after Johnson made an early exit from the Bank of America 500 because of an oil-pump issue on his No. 48 car.\nIt seems this particular critic of the Hendrick Motorsports driver believes Johnson is somehow \"helping\" teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. but not \"helping\" teammate Jeff Gordon. Both Earnhardt and Gordon are in the Chase; Johnson was eliminated from the Chase two weekends ago at Dover.\nCheck out the full exchange, along with Johnson's epic reply.\n@jimmiejohnson mainly just helping the 88 now?
