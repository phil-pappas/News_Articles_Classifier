Captain Chris Little ran the Talkin’ Trash out to the Washington, returning to the Ocean City Fishing Center with 10 yellowfin tuna, a bigeye and a pair of mahi on ice, and a white marlin release flag flying from the outriggers. The crew at Sunset Marina reported back-to-back trips to the Washington aboard the Marli for Captain Mark Hoos, with 19 yellowfins on ice at the end of one trip and a catch of 18 yellowfins and 10 gaffer dolphin the next day. By the weekend, torrential rains, high winds and waves pushing past 30 feet put the brakes on offshore action. Conditions improved by the beginning of the week, but extreme changes in water temperature will likely slow fishing both inshore and offshore for at least another week or two. Satellite images posted prior to the storm by Rutgers University showed sea surface temperatures in the mid to upper 70s in ocean waters off of Delmarva. Post storm images showed a 15- to 20-degree temperature drop for much of the inshore and offshore waters off of Delaware and Maryland. The normal circulation of the Gulfstream will push warmer water back up the coast, but don’t expect to find any decent temperature breaks in the Wilmington, Baltimore, Poormans or Washington Canyons any time soon. While it will take a while for the tuna, billfish and mahi action to turn on again, deep dropping for tilefish should be back to normal as soon as seas are calm enough to fish. Anglers targeting ocean flounder were already seeing declines in the number of keeper fish at Old Grounds, Fenwick Shoal and Artificial Reef Sites Nine and 10 before the storm due to their seasonal migration out to deeper structure. With the sharp drop in water temperatures, look for most of the bigger fluke to be making the move out to deeper structure at locations including Reef Site 11, the Del Jersey Land Reef, the Jackspot off of Ocean City and wrecks located between the 20-and 30-fathom lines. Boaters fishing the shallow wrecks and the structure piled up on the inshore reefs should be able to put some tautog, triggerfish and sheepsheads on ice. Shore fishermen also score on tog, triggers and sheepsheads this time of year along the Indian River Inlet Jetties. Bait with green crabs, sandfleas, fiddler crabs or fresh surf clams. The fall striped bass season is slowly getting underway in Indian River Inlet with reports of a few keeper fish being caught by anglers live lining eels or live spot at night. Look for the fish to improve as schools of bigger rockfish migrate down the coast later this month. Boaters running through the inlet and navigating the back bays should keep a sharp eye out for boards, pilings and other debris washed into the waterways by recent flooding. Local beaches took a real beating from the storm, according to reports passed along by the crew at Old Inlet Bait and Tackle. As a result, it is likely that some areas could remain closed to four-wheel access for a while. Surf casters who do get out can expect to see a lot of new cuts and sandbars that weren’t present a week ago.\nDELAWARE BAY\nThe combined effects of strong northeast winds, heavy rains, extreme tidal flooding and high waves made fishing impossible late last week and over the weekend. But with calmer conditions in the near-term forecast, boaters and shore fishermen should be able to get back on the fishing by this weekend. Catch reports from Lewes Harbour Marina showed good, lower and mid bay fishing for boaters fishing the structure piles on the artificial reefs, the lighthouse bases and the walls off of Lewes. Matt Shoup topped the pre-storm reports with a 13.24-pound sheepshead that he landed while fishing fiddler crabs at Brandywine Lighthouse. Marina owner Joe Morris also weighed a 6.7-pound sheepshead for Dave Walker . With water temperatures dropping into the low 60s over the past week, anglers can expect to see improved fishing for keeper tautog. Randy Jensen and Charlie Breitenbach fished the Lewes side of the Outer Wall with Asian shore crabs before the storm blew up the coast for a combined catch of eight nice blackfish. Look for tog action to improve at the Inner and Outer Walls and the Haystacks as bay temperatures continue to drop. Shore fishing will likely be slow over the next week or so due to muddy conditions in most of the lower bay tributaries. When the water starts to clear, fishermen should be able to connect with a few late season flounder and an occasional keeper rockfish along the banks of the Lewes/Rehoboth Canal, Roosevelt Inlet and Broadkill River. Sidney Smith at Smith’s Tackle reported good numbers of white perch, along with a few puppy drum and short stripers in the upper bay tidal creeks, with bloodworms and peeler crabs responsible for most of the catch. With weather conditions back to normal, the crew at Captain Bones Bait and Tackle are starting to hear reports of perch, short rockfish and channel catfish action at the Woodland Beach and Port Mahon fishing piers. The most effective baits, according to shop owner Patty Foley are bloodworms, squid and cut bunker.\nRIVERS\nReports from anglers fishing the Delaware River, Christiana River and the C&D Canal indicated improving channel catfish action, despite extremely muddy water conditions. Effective baits include night crawlers, cut bunker, peeler crabs and chicken livers. Anglers fishing along the banks of the Delaware River and the canal also are catching white perch and a few throwback stripers on bloodworms. Catch-and-release fishing for short stripers topped the weekly river report from the crew at Master Baiter’s Bait and Tackle, with the best fishing coming on bloodworms at the Route Nine Bridges in southern New Castle County. With extremely muddy conditions in the Nanticoke River, downstate fishermen have been focusing on other tidewater locations largemouth bass action. Ken Conners and Ricky Taylor checked in at Taylored Tackle in Seaford to report quality bass fishing in Maryland’s Wicomico River. According to the reports, the best fishing was along the bulkheads near the boat ramp on a mix of dark colored Senko plastics and Producto worms.\nPONDS\nAnglers checking in with George Pechin at the Williamsville Country Store has reports of catch-and-release action on striped bass to 25 inches in the spillway at Coursey Pond. Most of the reports indicated a mix of crankbaits, jigs and other lures normally used on largemouth bass to be working on the linesiders. With water levels and clarity improving in the local millponds, anglers stopping at Captain Bones Bait and Tackle are reporting improving action on both bass and crappie. Bass are responding to Senkos, jigs and crankbaits, while most of the panfish are reported to be hitting on jigs tipped with live minnows. Pond fishermen checking with the crew at Master Baiter’s Bait and Tackle reported decent action on largemouth bass at Becks Pond and Lums Pond, with live shiners listed as the most effective offering.\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1RtSS8D", "external_links": ["http://delonline.us/1RtSS8D"], "published": "2015-10-07T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:58:33.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
