Whenever I speak to football leaders - most of them agree that Blatter is corrupt. But they never speak out. They would rather hide behind a curtain of fear and contempt,\" Chung Mong-joon said. \n\"Back in 2002, during an ExCo meeting, I asked president Blatter his salary and expenses but he refused. Naturally for president Blatter to paid without ExCo approval is embezzlement. That is why I plan to sue Mr Blatter on his embezzlement in court.\" Related Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:22:04.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
