Rangers' Beltre played with torn ligament in thumb \nThe future Hall-of-Famer went on the disabled list from June 1-22, but didn’t miss additional time despite having the ligament damage in his thumb. \n\"The prevailing opinion was 'rest'. But that's not really in his vocabulary,” GM Jon Daniels said in the team’s postseason press conference. “So, he played through what ideally he would've had more time to let cool off.\" \nBeltre hit .287 with 18 home runs and 83 RBI in the 2015 season, including a .305 average with 12 homers and 65 RBI after his June 23 return from the DL. \nHe left Game 1 of the American League Division Series with stiffness in his back. After missing the next two games, Beltre talked his way back into the lineup and returned for Games 4 and 5, recording three hits over the final two games of the Rangers' season.
