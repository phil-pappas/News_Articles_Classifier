The calls didn't stop until 9:30 p.m. The phones continued all day Thursday, beginning at 8 a.m.\nStenstrum, the commissioner of the Southeastern Football Officials Association,\nwas dealing with antsy athletic directors who wanted to make sure they had officials for their games. Stenstrum fielded calls - both on his personal and work phones - to get officials to games Thursday night and tonight. Some games were postponed, then rescheduled, then postponed again. Today could be another eventful day as rain continues to fall.\nWhen asked how his day was going Thursday, Stenstrum burst into laughter.\n\"It's been a challenge but that's the nature of the beast,\" said Stenstrum, who has been with the association for 28 years, including as commissioner the last 10.\n\"But this doesn't happen to us often. But when it does, it's hectic.\"\nStenstrum is in charge of scheduling officials for varsity and junior varsity high school games, and middle school and recreation league games.\nFortunately, he said, he has a crew of 200 officials.\n\"If I was in the western part of the state, those guys have far fewer numbers,\" he said. \"They don't have the luxury of the numbers to pick from.\"\nStenstrum also is thankful he has officials who have flexible schedules.\n\"We do the best that we can do to make sure the schools get what they're looking for in terms of officials,\" he said. \"... We just adjust and try to do the best with their request.\"\nLarry Rubama, 757-446-2273,\nlarry.rubama@pilotonline.com\nTwitter: @LHRubama\nThe most-complete high school sports coverage\nin South Hampton Roads.\nFollow @757teamz Football 2015 public school schedules Top 10 teams Baseball | Softball | Boys soccer | Girls soccer Bloggers: Jami Frankenberry | Larry Rubama Posted to : High Schools Sports", "external_links": ["http://hamptonroads.com/2015/10/all-rain-scheduling-officials-pain", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-boys-soccer", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-girls-soccer", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/03/rankings-top-10-high-school-baseball", "http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/jami-frankenberry", "http://media.hamptonroads.com/cache/files/images/775031000.jpg", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-high-school-softball", "http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/larry-rubama", "https://twitter.com/757teamz", "http://hamptonroads.com/pilot/sports/high-schools", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?app_id=191370510928567&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F757teamz&send=false&layout=button_count&width=120&show_faces=true&action=like&colorscheme=light&font&height=28", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/07/2015-public-schools-football-schedules"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:20:16.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
