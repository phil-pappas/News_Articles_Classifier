(WKRC) -- Seven times No. 17 St. Lawrence was awarded a power play and each time the No. 14/15 Miami hockey team's penalty killing unit was up to the task as it grinded out a 1-0 road victory on Friday night. \nRyan McKay made 26 saves to notch his ninth career shutout and his first since blanking North Dakota in the 2014 National Collegiate Hockey Conference semifinals to extend the RedHawks' (3-1-1) winning streak to three games and their unbeaten streak to four games. \nPlay went back and forth over the first few minutes with both teams showing speed in transition. A Miami penalty at the 6:13 mark put St. Lawrence on the evening's first power play. The Red and White were sharp during the penalty kill and eventually forced the Saints into a penalty with 14 seconds remaining in their power play. MU's man advantage was also uneventful as the game remained scoreless past the midway point of the first. \nMiami's best opportunity of the opening stanza took place on its second power play late in the frame. Anthony Louis and Jack Roslovic moved the puck up ice and worked the puck in front to Sean Kuraly, who burst down the right side for a close-range shot that a sprawling Kyle Hayton deflected out of play. The Saints finished with a slight 10-9 edge in shots on goal, but the contest remained scoreless after 20 minutes. \nThe RedHawks fired the first five shots on goal to start the second period, though it was a good defensive zone block by Devin Loe that frustrated St. Lawrence into a slashing penalty. The third Miami power play was a charm as Louis made a nice stand in the neutral zone and fed Kuraly to drive wide down the right wing. The senior forward backhanded a pass through the slot to Roslovic, who wristed a shot through traffic at the 4:52 mark for his fourth goal of the season. Officials did take a second look at the goal, but ultimately the scoring play stood. \nAnother Red and White power play created some good puck movement and another Roslovic bid for a goal, but a one-timer off a cross ice feed ended up blocked away with the Saints eventually killing off the power play. \nA three-on-one rush by Miami drew a penalty on St. Lawrence and another man advantage. However, that one turned out to be MU's least effective power play as it took a penalty of its own 54 seconds into the power play to get the teams to finish the period at 4-on-4, with a Saints' power play pending at the start of the third. The RedHawks outshot the Saints 15-2 in the middle frame and skated to the dressing room with the 1-0 lead after 40 minutes. \nMiami was able to kill off the carry over penalty with little trouble to start the third period, but consecutive penalties 52 seconds apart gave the Saints a two-man advantage at the 3:14 mark. The RedHawks held their formation and got timely stops from McKay to salt away both penalties with its one-goal lead intact. \nThat penalty kill became a theme in a third period that saw five St. Lawrence power plays and seven total man advantages. Miami got two opportunities with the man advantage as well, coming at 7:41 and 11:36, respectively. Neither were able to connect to provide breathing room for the defense. \nThe Saints once again went to work on a power play with 5:19 to go, but McKay came up with three crucial stops to keep it a 1-0 advantage. With time winding down, Hayton was pulled for an extra skater and an icing infraction put the faceoff in Miami territory with 40 seconds remaining. St. Lawrence won consecutive faceoffs and tried quick shots, one of which was blocked out of play and another was snared by McKay's glove. After tying up a third draw and burning some time with the puck in the corner, the Saints worked the puck to the point. Nolan Gluchowski tried to fling a shot through traffic, but Kevin Morris got in the lane for a block and cleared the zone to seal away the shutout win. \nMiami ended up with a 29-26 edge in shots, though SLU had a 14-5 advantage in the third thanks to its five power plays. The RedHawks' special teams were the difference in the contest as they connected on one of their seven power plays while killing off all seven Saint power plays. McKay recorded his ninth career shutout by turning away all 26 SLU shots while Hayton stopped 28 of 29 MU attempts. \nThe Red and White finish up their series with the Saints on Saturday. Opening faceoff is at 7 p.m. \nImage and information provided by Miami University Athletics Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:05:30.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
