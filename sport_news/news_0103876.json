That'll mark the end of a high school football career for a Northwestern senior who's been battling more than opposing teams. \nNolan Peterson has found at least a partial remedy to a challenge he's faced for years. \n\"I guess just to play, try not to think about it much and do what I need to do as best as I can,\" Peterson said. \nDoctors diagnosed Peterson with muscular dystrophy in junior high. \n\"I would always walk on my toes. My heals don't go to the ground, and I would get really tired in practice and stuff, and I couldn't run as fast or be as fast as the other kids so that's what kind of started it off,\" Peterson said. \nAt the time, he wasn't sure what to expect. Now in his final year of high school, he's still playing football, basketball and baseball. \n\"I'm slower than everybody else, so it's hard to pick up some speed but yeah it can be hard,” Peterson said. “So when I get so stiff and stuff it's hard to move, but I can get through it most of the days.\" \nPeterson doesn't want his condition to take away from playing time. He stretches whenever he can so he's able to stay in the game, and he looks for ways to compensate while on the field. \n\"I try to anticipate more. Anticipation makes me faster and that's what I try to do is use my brain as much as possible,\" Peterson said. \nPushing himself too hard could result in serious health consequences. His brother Nate is an assistant coach and has gotten used to monitoring him. He says he's proud of what his brother has accomplished. \n\"Everybody enjoys him, the whole community,” Nate Peterson said. “When he's either shooting baskets or completing passes, you can just hear everybody cheering loud for him, and so I think that's what helps is when everyone is behind his back because he's such a good kid.\" \nIn school, Peterson is reigning homecoming king, student of the month and has assumed student leadership roles. Having a disease that causes weakness and loss of muscle mass, Peterson admits he's nervous about the future. \n\"I am but I try not to keep my mind on it. Just do what I can right now and if it happens, it happens but yeah just try to keep going,\" Peterson said. \"I just do whatever I can to keep playing sports because that's what I like the most.\" \nNolan Peterson plans to attend SDSU next year to study agronomy. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
