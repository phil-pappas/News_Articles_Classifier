All four candidates self-identify as conservatives, even the lone Democrat, John Bel Edwards,” Sherman said.\nHe thinks some voters may decide based on who they don’t want to see in office.\n“Sometimes when folks go in that voting booth, they pull that lever for someone they really like, and sometimes they hold their nose and choose the least worst of the candidates,” Sherman said.\nSherman thinks if the governor’s race goes into a runoff, it could mean a higher than average turnout for the runoff election.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
