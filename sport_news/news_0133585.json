What Cal’s got is a solid-gold Heisman Trophy candidate leading a circus offense, a shaky but improved defense, and genuine hope.\nThe No. 23 Bears (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) play the No. 5 Utah Utes (4-0, 1-0) on Saturday night in Salt Lake City. This is the game that will tell you everything you need to know about Cal. This is the Bears’ chance to separate themselves from last year’s team, which right now is looming in their side-view mirror like the attacking dinosaur in “Jurassic Park.”\nThe consensus is that Cal is better than last year’s team, which started 4-1, then nosedived.\nCal senior safety Stefan McClure on Tuesday described the 2014 season as, “That nightmare that we had out there last year.”\nBryce Treggs, senior wide receiver, said last year’s team got a bit fat-headed.\n“I believe we believed our own hype a little bit,” Treggs said. “We started getting complacent a little bit, and we lost that hunger we had the first half of the season.”\nIt is possible that the Bears last year simply played to their schedule, running up wins early against weaker foes, then crumbling when the schedule turned on them.\nTreggs doesn’t buy that. He pointed out that Cal lost to UCLA by two and had a late chance to win, and came back strong against USC but fell short.\n“The signs of an immature team are finding a way not to get over that hump,” Treggs said.\nStanding up to the Utes would demonstrate that this Cal team has grown up and now gets over humps. This Cal team, it wants to believe, is not only better, but also more mature. When you were a kid, you did stupid things that you’re now ashamed of, right? That’s how this Cal team looks at itself. The players are hungry to prove they’ve grown up. \nHead coach Sonny Dykes is working hard this week to get his players to ignore the buzz and hype. The game will be featured on ESPN’s “College GameDay.” Junior quarterback Jared Goff is college football’s new media darling, appearing on every national TV and radio show, and all the magazine covers.\nRight now, Cal and Goff are kind of college football’s version of Stephen Curry and the Warriors: a superstar running an exciting offense, backed by an improving defense.\nDykes is trying to stamp out the trash-can fire of hype. \n“We haven’t talked about (the national ranking) much,” Dykes said. “When we were ranked last (in defense last season), we didn’t talk about it. Now that we’re not ranked last, we’re not going to talk about it, either. The things we stress to our players (is) let’s worry about things we can control. Let’s work hard, let’s go to class, be a good student, a good person.” \nUnder Dykes, Cal was last in the nation in yards-allowed-per-game in 2014. And the Bears were also near the bottom academically, although that was pretty much fallout from the previous coaching regime, and Dykes works hard on correcting that.\nBut if the Bears want to think they’re pulling themselves up from the very rock bottom, that’s fine. Whatever works.\nDykes said he doesn’t really have his antennae tuned to the buzz.\n“We’re so insulated,” he said, referring to coaches in general. “I mean, heck, you don’t really know what’s going on. You’re not too much up on world events. It’s hard to know what day of the week it is. You feel a little something different (this season), you don’t really know what it is ...\n“When you get your coffee in the morning, maybe those people are a little nicer to you than they used to be. Don’t have to worry about somebody poisoning my coffee like you used to.”\nIsn’t it just like Cal to skimp on the athletic frills? Big-time football coach doesn’t even have his own coffee taster?\nDykes will work hard to ignore and control the outside buzz, but his players, they get out in the world more.\nTreggs, asked if the Bears pay attention to the rankings, said, “Yes, definitely. We’re trying to stay in the national conversation. ... We’re definitely looking at this as a good opportunity to (stand in) the national spotlight and make a statement.”\nScott Ostler is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.
