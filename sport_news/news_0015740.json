Last Friday and Saturday featured lopsided outcomes except the McCann Tech-Mount Greylock game that was undecided going into the second half. Can this week's match-ups provide closer contests and narrow the widening gap between the upper-echelon and the rest of the league? Bye Weeks: None \nSpectators in Dalton may feel the need to wear a mouthpiece while watching what is sure to be a physical match-up between Hoosac Valley and Wahconah at 7 p.m., tonight. \nWahconah has a 3-2 record, winning two in a row, after dropping two games for the first time since 2012. \nThis rivalry game has been very heavy on defense as of late. The last two match-ups have been 8-7 wins by Wahconah. \nIn 2013, quarterback Ethan Wells scored from two yards out and punched in a two-point conversion with 2 minutes and 36 seconds left for the victory. \nLast season, Nick Clayton hit Ryan Washburn from 16 yards out for a touchdown with 2:06 left in the game. This time is was Clayton's two-point conversion run that gave Wahconah the win. \nThose games were defensive battles, but Hoosac's offense has not been slowed down yet, as the 'Canes are averaging 38 points per game. Running back Brenden Ellsworth has shouldered the offensive load the last two games, filling in for starter Avery Hall. Advertisement \nThe 5-foot-10 185-pound junior scored three times in the first half, leading the 'Canes to a 42-12 win over Monument last Saturday. Sophomore quarterback Nicholas Waterman got the start under center, filling in for Matt Koperniak. He showed off a strong arm, throwing for a touchdown and, converting a pair of two-point conversion passes. \nThe status of Hall and Koperniak's are not clear for tonight. \nThe status of Wahconah running back Tyler Cataldi is also unclear, but Evan Garvey did a good job filling in, rushing for 181 yards and three touchdowns against the Blue Devils. \nOne player that will be back is Wahconah tight end/defensive end Cole Morrison. He made his season debut against Drury last week. Morrison will be key in stopping Hoosac's rushing attack, and he adds another target — especially in the red zone — for quarterback Will Genaway. \nWahconah coach Gary Campbell Jr., did not hesitate to go for the win in those in his last two late-game situations against Hoosac. This season, he does have the luxury of having a kicker in sophomore Patrick Butler. Butler hit two field goals in the Warriors' 40-6 win over Drury last week, but a crunch-time field goal may be a lot to ask of the first-year player. \n\"Patrick Butler is going to be a whale of a kicker,\" Campbell said after last week's game. \"He's got great range, and he kicked a couple through the end zone tonight. He kicks [the ball] high and deep on kickoffs. ... We all see the end result of fields goals — make or miss. But we've got to get better at snapping, catching and placing it down. That's a tougher thing than you think.\" \nLEE AT MOUNT GREYLOCK, 7 P.M. TONIGHT \nThis game is an intriguing match-up between two teams with 2-3 records. On paper, it appears to be a showdown between two senior quarterbacks. Greylock's Brodie Altiere threw three touchdowns during the Mounties' 30-24 win over McCann Tech. Lee's Cam Abderhalden threw two touchdowns in a 36-12 loss to Pittsfield. Altiere has seven total touchdown tosses, while Abderhalden has four. \nBoth signal callers can move the ball through the air, however, the team that establishes the run will be in the best position to win. \nPittsfield's 325 yards on the ground, made it the third team to rush for 300-plus yards against the Wildcats this season. \nHeading into last week, Greylock's Pat Storie had 312 yards rushing on 43 carries. He's a proven runner going up against a shaky Lee run defense. \nUntil Lee establishes its own running game, or the ability to stop the run, Abderhalden will have to lead the Black and Orange with his arm. \nDRURY AT TACONIC, 7 P.M. TONIGHT \nTonight's game at Wahconah Park presents an interesting challenge for a young Drury (0-5) team. The Blue Devils use their spread offense to create passing opportunities for quarterback Kody Croiser and receiver Hayden Bird. Bird leads the team with 13 catches for 260 yards. He had two catches for 10 yard in Drury's 40-6 loss to Wahconah last week. \nUnfortunately for the Blue Devils, Taconic (4-1) has one of the top secondaries in the county. \nThe Braves added two more interceptions to their tally during their 42-7 win over Ludlow, giving them 10 on the season. \nBird, running back Thaylen Harrison and slot receiver Jamal Beda are all capable options, but Croiser must have time to throw and be pinpoint with his passes. \nMCCANN TECH AT DEAN TECH 7 P.M. TONIGHT \nMcCann Tech needs to rebound from its first loss of the season by returning to what earned them a Division VI championship last season — a strong running game and defense. \nLast week's 30-24 loss to Mount Greylock saw the Hornets defense struggle to stop the Mounties' passing attack. McCann allowed touchdowns of 30, 85 and 94 yards. \nCoach Bob LeClair said the game was a learning experience, and unfortunately for Dean Tech, the Hawks could be in line for a lesson. \nMcCann won last season's match-up 55-8, and coming off a loss, Nick Lincoln and company should have a chip on their shoulders. \nPITTSFIELD AT MONUMENT MOUNTAIN 3 P.M. SATURDAY \nPittsfield brings its seemingly endless string of ballcarriers to Great Barrington to face a Monument Mountain team that struggled without lead back Mike Buffoni. \nThe quartet of Edwin Rodriguez, Sam Sala, Mason Papirio and Brian Rodriguez all bring different elements to the Pittsfield (4-1) running attack. When Sala left with an ankle injury during the third quarter of the Generals' win over Lee, Edwin Rodriguez filled the void, finishing with 104 yards rushing and two touchdowns. Add in Kolbe Muzzy's running ability and Pittsfield has more than enough weapons to keep its offense flowing. \nFor the Spartans, they managed just 113 yards rushing, with nearly half of those yards coming on a 52-yard touchdown scramble from quarterback Brenden Perry. Perry's 80-yard touchdown pass to Cayvon Truden added to the stats, but their offense struggled for a majority of the game. \nEven if Buffoni plays, it'll take a near-perfect game to stop a Pittsfield team that seems to be hitting its stride.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:36:42.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
