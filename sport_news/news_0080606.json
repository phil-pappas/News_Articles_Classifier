Kotoko on the other hand have also set up a recruitment team who has reportedly drawn a 10-man shortlist of targeted players with Asokwa Deportivoâ€™s Joe Fameyeh on its radar. \nAshia has been a long term target for both clubs and with reports claiming he will welcome a move away from the Dansoman club, the pursuit has intensified. \nThe attacking midfielder is a reliable source of goals in the league and will decrease the burden of scoring goals as both Hearts and Kotoko as they were found wanting in the goal scoring department last season. \nAdams on the other hand has been a safe pair of hands for the Dormaa side since their promotion to the top flight. His great form earned him a call up to the Black Stars. \nWith both clubs also leaking goals last season, they both see the experienced goalie as a great leader of their defensive line to spearhead a title challenge next season. \nBoth clubs have got one over the other with Hearts winning the Abanga duel and Kotoko winning with Charles Taylor. Which club will emerge victorious this time?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:56:26.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
