At 2:10 a.m., someone reported to the Arizona Department of Public Safety seeing another person fire at least one shot with a handgun from a black sedan traveling westbound along I-10 near milepost 153. While troopers were arriving to that scene, a second \"shots fired\" call was reported in the area of I-10 and 35th Avenue and also involved someone firing shots from a black sedan. DPS troopers along with the Phoenix Police Department helicopter were able to follow the suspect vehicle to 83rd Avenue and I-10 where it pulled into an apartment complex, said spokesman Tim Case. Scanner traffic reveals the conversation between officials who were tracking the vehicle on the ground and in the air via a helicopter. \"Passenger stuck his head out the window and fired,\" someone says over the police scanner. \"I got at least probably three or four in the vehicle and they're all kind of bailing out walking...different directions,\" someone overhead in the helicopter says. \"It was the passenger that was firing correct?\"\"That's affirmative,\" some answers back. \"I got a white shirt, red hat, black pants he's the front passenger,\" the person in the helicopter said. Two people were taken into custody and a third person was detained about 45 minutes later. The black sedan was seized as evidence, he said. Case said he does not believe these new rounds of shootings are related to the larger investigation into the freeway shootings . He called this incident \"isolated.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:53:24.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
