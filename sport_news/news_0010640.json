Rodriguez worked several combinations on the cooler before it tumbled to the ground. \nThe one-sided bout drew an avalanche of meme’s and GIFs as well as a @Piratescooler parody Twitter account that quickly gained over 8,000 followers. Rodriguez took to Twitter to apologize on Thursday “for allowing my emotions to control my actions in a negative manner.” \nRodriguez added he “spoke to the cooler, apologized personally, and he’s forgiven me as Christ forgives all.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:58:52.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
