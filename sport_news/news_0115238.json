It is money that would help the department hire 150 additional officers to bring the force to 1,266 officers.\nThe mayor is also proposing a 15-percent pay hike for officers. He and the police chief believe that will boost retention and hiring.\n\"Our city’s population is growing, we’re attracting new businesses and retail that is creating jobs and our property values are up. This hard work is paying off and as a result, our revenue is up and we can invest more in our citizens’ priorities including public safety,\" Landrieu said.\nThe mayor's budget gives the fire department over $4 million more to hire about 50 new fire fighters and an additional $43 million for the firefighters' pension fund, but it does not solve the ongoing fight in court over millions in back pay and pension fund issues.\nThe District Attorney's Office and public defender would also get more funds under Landrieu’s budget.\nThe mayor also wants voters to renew a millage to fund a bond sale for street repairs. He says taxes would not go up.\nAlso included in the mayor's budget proposal:\nCOMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SAFET\nIn 2016, NOPD will receive an additional $10.5 million plus another $300,000 increase in consent decree funding.
