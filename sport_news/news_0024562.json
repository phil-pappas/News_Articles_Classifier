And the numbers are expected to mushroom as the season goes on and fans are bombarded with more enticing ads. \nDraftKings and FanDuel spent $26.1 million combined on TV commercials in Week 1 of the NFL season, according to ad tracker iSpot.tv. Since Aug. 1, Boston-based DraftKings spent upwards of $80 million to air 22,000 ads. During the same period, New York-based FanDuel spent $20 million on 7,500 ads. \nTheir ubiquitous commercials have surpassed sports advertising for beer companies and car manufacturers. In fact, in September, DraftKings aired 25,000 ads, more than any other brand in any industry. \n\"Get winnings right away!\" the ads promise. \"Get Cash!\" A young man named Erik Hafner is featured on one testimonial, saying: \"I started with a $25 deposit, and I made over $62,000.\" \nAs sports junkies fantasize about being general managers of teams, they plunk down entry fees ranging from $1 to $250 to draft make-believe rosters and pit their \"teams\" against those of other pretend GMs. Meanwhile, major investors with lots to gain have been pouring money into the daily fantasy sports industry. \nFanDuel in July got $275 million of investments from companies that include Google, Time Warner, NBC Sports, and Turner. \nDraftKings — whose CEO and cofounder is 34-year-old Jason Robins— raised $300 million from Fox Sports, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, Major League Soccer and Madison Square Garden. \nThe number of participants is staggering, and the leagues and networks have taken note. It’s in their best interest to fund and promote FanDuel, DraftKings and other fantasy leagues because the pretend teams generate interest in the players of the real teams, which spikes TV ratings and merchandise sales. Fans who normally wouldn’t follow teams other than their home teams now have a vested interest in the performance of players all over the country. \nThis has spawned a new industry of insider tips and phone apps. \nAccording to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, 56.8 million people in the United States and Canada are playing fantasy sports this year, up from 41 million last year. The average player spends $465 a year. \nDraftKings had 200,000 registered users in 2014, and this year it is up to 2 million. FanDuel has more than 1 million users and promises payouts of $75 million weekly. \nDespite their popularity, FanDuel and DraftKings find themselves embroiled in a scandal, as New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced last week that he had launched an investigation into possible advantages daily fantasy company employees might have gained by using data unavailable to the public to win prizes in a competitor’s contests. \nThe trouble began when DraftKings employee Ethan Haskell published data revealing which players were included on most rosters. The next day, Haskell finished second in a FanDuel million-dollar contest and won $350,000. \nKnowing the percentages of entrants who chose particular players could give you an edge that would lead to a bigger payout. \nU.S. Representative Frank Pallone Jr., of New Jersey, surprised by the volume of FanDuel and DraftKings commercials at the opening of the NFL season, has called for a congressional hearing to \"review the legal status of fantasy sports.\" \nAnd Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey also has asked for a review of the legality of the industry. \nThere is a fine line between legal and illegal online gaming. Online poker and waging on games is illegal. But monetized fantasy sports are legal in all but five states — Montana, Washington, Louisiana, Iowa and Arizona. \nFantasy league companies and supporters say their business is exempt from the federal Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act (UIGEA) because theirs are considered games of skill rather than games of chance. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:23:38.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
