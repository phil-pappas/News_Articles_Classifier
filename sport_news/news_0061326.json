Lions in a 198-yard outing.\nThat performance earned Bowman his second CFL Player of the Week nod this season and ranks right up there among his career best.\nA 69-yard TD catch paved the way for Bowman’s big day and even quarterback Mike Reilly was impressed.\n“I thought he did a great job on that deep ball,” said Reilly. “I thought I overthrew him and then he started doing that ostrich walk or whatever, the flamingo walk into the end zone. That was a great play by him to keep his balance and it was a play we needed.”\nBowman had his struggles earlier this year, but seems to have found his stride at just the right time.\n“Earlier in the year, I should have been a whole lot better,” said Bowman. “The hardest part (on the long ball) was to just get going. I gave it all and I just hoped Mike saw me. My guy saw me. Once I saw it in the air, I was a bit selfish. I wanted to score. Thankfully, my legs held up.\n“All the guys thought I was going to hurt myself.”\nThat play paved the way to the most explosive performance by Bowman this season, but ranks just third-best as an Eskimo and fourth-best overall in his career.\nAs fate would have it, Bowman’s career game happened in the last game of the 2011 season, when he romped for 226 yards and a pair of TDs against the Saskatchewan Roughriders.\nBowman may not repeat at the CFL’s top receiver this year but right now he’s No. 2, right behind Calgary’s Eric Rogers, with 1,084 yards on the season.\n“I’m very honoured and thankful for that,” said Bowman about his POW selection. “I have to give all the praise to my teammates. It’s a great honour, but all I can think of is the journey we’ve been on all year.”\nWhat’s made this season much more fun for Bowman is the fact he’s finally on a championship-calibre team surrounded a group of younger, yet unselfish players.\n“Two years ago, it seemed we couldn’t pull those close games out,” said Bowman. “Our team has made it routine. I’ve never been in this position before. We do have a good football team. The honours are great, but we have a lot more to do.”\nThere’s a certain level of comfort in the Mike Reilly-to-Adarius Bowman combination, which has been the offence’s bread-and-butter.\n“I don’t think it was a surprise to anybody who’s watched him for as long as he’s been here that he’s capable of those types of games any time,” said Reilly.\nOne of the biggest differences since the start of the year has been the fact Reilly now has more weapons and the offence does not have to depend as much on Bowman as it has in the past.\n“One of the best things in the last couple of months is that the ball is being spread around and you don’t know who’s going to have the big game,” said Reilly. “We’ve had the league’s leading receiver in the two years prior to this (Fred Stamps in 2013 and Bowman in 2014). Whether we get that or not this year, it doesn’t have a bearing on the quality of our best receiver, whoever that may be. It just means we have more options. Guys are stepping up to the plate and taking a bit of pressure off Adarius.”\nHead coach Chris Jones is well aware of Bowman’s value.\n“He’s a matchup nightmare,” said Jones.\ncon.griwkowsky@sunmedia.ca\nEskimos receiver Adarius Bowman earns second POW nod of season\nBy Con Griwkowsky , Edmonton Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 06:29 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 11:03 PM EDT\nAdarius Bowman can count the type of game he had against B.C. on one hand … and still have one finger left over.\nThe Eskimos wideout was in full flight Saturday against the B.C.
