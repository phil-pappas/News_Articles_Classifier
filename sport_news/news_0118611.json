RANGERS 4, COYOTES 1\nEverywhere the Mets go these days, the New York team wins.\nMets pitcher Matt Harvey was James Dolan’s guest at the Garden Thursday night at a Rangers 4-1 win over the Arizona Coyotes. Fresh off advancing to the World Series, Harvey received a thunderous ovation in the second period before congratulating Rangers players and coach Alain Vigneault in the weight room after.\n“Go, Mets, go,” Vigneault said with a grin, adding that he told Harvey: “Good luck. We’re with ya.”\nHarvey did not do interviews, but Vigneault said this wasn’t the first time they had met. Harvey followed the Rangers’ spring 2014 run to the Stanley Cup Final while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery, including an appearance at the visitors’ locker room in Montreal during that year’s Eastern Conference finals.\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News Mets pitcher Matt Harvey gets a big ovation from the Garden faithful. “He’s excited,” Henrik Lundqvist (34 saves) said of Harvey, a friend. “I’m happy for him, the way he’s been able to stay focused throughout. Obviously it’s a little crazy right now in the city when a sports team makes it to the finals. I’m happy for him, for the Mets. As an athlete in New York, you always appreciate success for sports teams in this city because people really care about it, and it’s exciting.”\nExciting was not the best description of the start to the Rangers’ second straight win. Arizona (3-3-1) led 1-0 at first intermission on a soft Klas Dahlbeck goal despite not putting a shot on Lundqvist until 14:46 in.\nThe Rangers (5-2-1), however, responded with four unanswered goals, highlighted by Chris Kreider’s first of the season to tie it one apiece at 10:06 of the second and Keith Yandle’s first on the power play against his former team for a 3-1 lead at 6:24 of the third.\nThe Coyotes drafted Yandle, 29, in 2005, and he played in Arizona from 2006 through last spring until his trade to the Rangers in exchange, primarily, for young talent Anthony Duclair and a first-round pick. So this wasn’t just another game for him.\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News Henrik Lundqvist makes 34 saves on Thursday night.\n“I tried not to think about it too much, tried not to let it get to me,” said Yandle, who sold his house in Arizona this summer and now lives in Manhattan. “But just seeing guys out there that I haven’t seen in a while and playing against them, it was a little bit emotional. But after the first, in time, it was a fun game to play in.”\nThe Rangers appear to be having a bit more fun in big thanks to Mats Zuccarello, who had two assists, easily could have had three, and looked dangerous almost every time he had the puck. J.T. Miller also assisted on Kevin Hayes’ goal into an empty-net at 2:35 of the third for the go-ahead and game-winning goal, blocking a turnover by Coyotes goalie Mike Smith (24 saves) out in front.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:11:14.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
