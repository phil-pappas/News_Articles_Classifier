Croft’s impact on the game was felt in a variety of ways, from his 23-yard field goal before halftime to his pair of interceptions. Brendan Hicks, Ramstein: The defending Division I champion Royals punched their playoff ticket Saturday with a dramatic 14-7 win over Wiesbaden in a rematch of last year’s title game. Hicks put Ramstein up in the first half with a 1-yard rushing touchdown, the highlight of a 28-carry, 114-yard performance. Marc Magwood, Rota: The Admirals needed standout games from key players if they were to knock off Bitburg last Saturday, and Magwood happily complied. He turned in 148 all-purpose yards with a touchdown on offense while returning a fumble 95 yards for another score. Aamaree Harrington, Vilseck: Teammates Drew Pinckney and Bryce McGregor crossed the goal line in the Falcons’ 14-0 defeat of Kaiserslautern on Saturday, but Harrington’s steady gains carried the day. The running back collected 126 yards on 19 rushes as Vilseck worked its way further into the Division I postseason picture. Volleyball Abigail Zipperman and Julia Smith, Stuttgart: The Panthers needed just six sets Saturday to serve notice that they’ll be a force in the upcoming Division I tournament. Zipperman had three kills and five blocks in a rout of divisional foe Vilseck, while Smith turned in 13 kills in a stunning sweep of defending Division I champion and previously undefeated Wiesbaden. Ally Donley, Alconbury: The Dragons fought off a challenge from Division III rival Brussels on Saturday thanks in large part to Donley’s efforts. She collected 18 assists and 13 aces in her team’s 23-25, 25-17, 25-11, 25-15 defeat of the visiting Brigands. Emma Knapp, Vicenza: The Cougars continued their strong season with a sweep of host Aviano. Knapp had six aces and 17 assists in the runaway victory. Cross country Austin Burt, Lakenheath: The homestanding Lancer took a 13-second win in Saturday’s northern meet, a feat that ranks second only to the fact that he’s competing at all. The sophomore started running three years ago after recovering from an accident that nearly cost him the use of his leg. Rose Gray, International School of Brussels: The freshman said her running is “starting to pick up” after Saturday’s race. That’s bad news for the rest of DODDS-Europe, as Gray is already at a pace that gave her a first-place finish in the meet at Lakenheath.
