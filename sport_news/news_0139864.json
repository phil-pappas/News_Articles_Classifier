It came immediately after the Impact's Andres Romero left the game on a stretcher because of an apparent right knee injury.\nThe Impact increased their lead to four points over seventh-place Orlando City for the final Eastern Conference playoff position. Both teams have two games left.\nLucas Pittinari put a low hard shot on the frame for Colorado in second-half stoppage time, but Bush saved it with a well-timed dive to his right.\nWith Montreal's victory, New York City FC was eliminated from postseason contention.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:51:05.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
