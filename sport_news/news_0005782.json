Talia’s manager says AFL probe nearly done \nMichael Talia’s manager is confident the AFL will soon clear the new Sydney player of leaking game-sensitive information. \nTalia, then playing for the Western Bulldogs, came under investigation after last month’s season-ending elimination final loss to Adelaide. \nThe Bulldogs called in the AFL amid allegations Talia leaked information to his brother Daniel, who plays for the Crows. \nMichael Talia joined the Swans on Thursday in one of the last deals of the AFL trade period. \n“We had no other option, after what went on there (the Bulldogs),” Liam Pickering told SEN radio. \n“I believe it (the investigation) has been concluded – I’ve spoken to one of the guys today at the AFL and I think they’re writing up their report at the moment. \n“I’d say there’s a decision coming on that which I fully expect to be positive for the boys.” \nSince the story broke last month, Pickering has defended the two brothers. \nHe said Michael in particular has been hung out to dry. \n“It’s been a really unwanted distraction (and) it’s been extremely unfair on Michael and his family. \n“It (the trade) is good for Michael – he can get on with it now and become a Sydney player.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:07:39.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
