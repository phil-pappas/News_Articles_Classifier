Article \nIt was all supposed to be different this time for the Cincinnati Bengals. \n\nThis was supposed to be their coming-of-age moment; undefeated coming into Sunday’s game against the two-time defending NFC champion Seahawks, this was supposed to be a statement game for the Bengals. \nThey had trailed for less than two minutes in their previous four games. Andy Dalton’s quarterback rating was off the charts and he was being mentioned in the same league as Aaron Rodgers and the game’s elite. \nCincinnati scored on its opening possession with an 86-yard drive. \nThen. Fade to ugly: \nDalton is intercepted at the Seattle goal line. \nDumb penalties. \nA fumble Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner returns for a touchdown. \nA defence shredded for 169 yards by running back Thomas Rawls, subbing for the injured Marshawn Lynch. It couldn’t have gotten much worse; Same old Bengals — down 24-7 headed into the fourth quarter. \nAnd, then, Cinderella arrived at the ball. \nThe Bengals turned tiger. The team that had not been able to win the big moments, grew up. Behind Dalton’s pinpoint passing, the special teams play of Adam Jones and a defence that forced six consecutive Seattle punts over the final minutes, the Bengals won a 27-24 overtime thriller. \n“For us to come back against a really, really good team is huge,” Dalton said after Mike Nugent banked a 42-yard field goal off the left post, allowing Cincinnati to open the season 5-0 for the first time in 27 years. Much of the game, the Bengals seemed second-best. Seattle had not surrendered a 17-point lead since 2004. \nThe Bengals habitually have found a way to fall short in these situations. \nPlaying against the league’s second-ranked defence, there is a sense the Bengals have won a watershed moment. While it seemed in doubt for a while, the statement they made is that they are for real. They can defend — sacking Russell Wilson at his own 14 to force the punt that started the game-wining drive. \nThey can throw — four receivers with more than 60 yards and Tyler Eifert’s two TDs, plus a dramatic diving catch setting up the tying field goal. \nThey can overcome adversity. Dalton threw for 331 yards against a ball-hawking defence. “I’m so proud of this team for fighting. You never know how things happen and we gave them points, but it feels good to be where we’re at,” said Dalton. “We faced a really good team, one that has won Super Bowls. It just showed the resilience of this team.” \nCincinnati trailed 10-7 at the half — and mostly had themselves to blame. \nA penalty to Andrew Whitworth nullified a 72-yard touchdown pass to A.J. Green. An interception inside the red zone cost the Bengals another field goal and allowed Seattle to drive for three points of its own. \nIt looked like the same bad Bengals when Seattle scored two TDs within 117 seconds early in the third quarter. Rawls busted a 69-yard TD run. On Cincinnati’s next possession, Michael Bennett went unblocked, knocking the ball from Rex Burkhead’s grip. Bobby Wagner picked it up, running 23 yards to the end zone for a 24-7 lead. \n“It’s going to be grind,” said Bengals’ coach Marvin Lewis, after Cincinnati matched the second-biggest comeback in franchise history. “It takes four quarters. Today it took five. The important thing is just to never quit.” \nTrailing 24-7, it seemed Seattle was in control, except this Dalton Gang fought back. Jones’ 34-yard punt return set up a TD pass to Eiffert. \nThe defence held, Dalton drove downfield again, diving through on a six-yard keeper to cut the deficit to 24-21. “We imploded in the third quarter, but we righted ourselves and started putting one play on top of another and kept going,” Lewis said. \nA Geno Atkins tackle on a Wilson scramble forced another punt. Dalton drove 69 yards without a time out, Eiffert diving in front of Kam Chancellor with an breath-taking catch, the field goal team racing on to the field to beat the clock with the tying field goal. \nIn overtime, Seattle never got out of the shadow of its own goalposts, the Bengals forcing punts twice. “We wanted to show that we’ve got a great defence and a great team,” cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick said. “We overcame a lot of things in this game. This will be motivation for us that we’ll be able to look back on. We’ve been in this situation, and we’ve overcome it.” \nTHE DEAD ZONE \nDetroit has been known for its muggings. But usually they don’t end up happening in broad daylight in front of 60,000 people. \nThe Detroit Lions didn’t just see their record drop to 0-5. They were bullied, had their lunch stolen and their caps pulled over their eyes as the Cardinals romped to a 42-10 victory. \nEarly in the third quarter, half the fans at Ford Field had left. Nothing to see, here. At least, nothing to enjoy. Carson Palmer silenced the crowd with a 99-yard drive hitting John Brown with a TD pass to open a 21-7 lead in the third quarter. \nRashad Johnson had two interceptions and a fumble recovery as the Lions turned the ball over six times, surrendering 28 points in a disastrous second quarter — this after a Calvin Johnson fumble at the goal line cost them a win last week. \nQUICK HITS \nOne of the best defensive performances featured Chiefs’ lineman Allen Bailey with seven tackles, one for a loss, a QB pressure, a forced fumble and a sack ... Seattle was a point spread underdog just the fifth time since the start of 2013. With Sunday’s loss their record is 1-4 straight up ... Robbie Gould’s third-quarter field goal gave him 1,118 career points, passing Kevin Butler for the franchise’s all-time scoring record ... Drew Brees had three turnovers leading to 17 points for Philadelphia ... Julius Thomas made his debut for Jacksonville, playing for the first time since breaking his right hand in the pre-season opener, had two catches for 20 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:41:46.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
