Bun B, who was one half of the acclaimed Port Arthur, Texas rap group Underground Kingz, released the song last week, and the team played it at Minute Maid Park before Game 4 of the American League Division Series against the Royals.\n\"This team deserved it,\" Bun B told The Associated Press. \"This city deserved it.\"\nGame 5 is Wednesday night in Kansas City.\nDone over the beat to Tyga's 2011 hit \"Rack City,\" the track mentions many of Houston's players by name and even references the fact that ace Dallas Keuchel had a perfect 15-0 record at home this season.\nBun B is a longtime Astros fan who supported the team even during its worst seasons over the past few years. Before this season the Astros, who lost more than 100 games in three straight seasons from 2011-13, hadn't been to the playoffs since reaching the World Series in 2005.\n\"It's amazing,\" Bun B said of Houston's season. \"We suffered through a lot of years in this city, with this organization. But we've got a great owner now. We've got great management. We've got a great front office and most importantly we've got great guys in the dugout.\"\nHouston star rookie Carlos Correa said he thought the song was pretty good. It probably didn't hurt that it includes the line: \"We got Carlos Correa he's the rookie of the year.\" All-Star second baseman Jose Altuve also got a shout out for piling up 200 hits for the second straight season.\nThe about 2 ½ minute song also discusses Club Astros, a name given to the transformation Houston's clubhouse undergoes after each win. Players bought flashing lights and a fog machine and the clubhouse looks more like a disco than a dressing room following a victory by the Astros.\nMany of the players were amused by a line in the song addressing the fact that left fielder Colby Rasmus always takes the field with his shoulder-length brown hair dripping wet.\n\"Hey Colby, don't dry your hair bro,\" Bun B bellows in the song.\nBun B was tickled to hear that the Astros liked that part.\n\"I didn't want it just to be fun for me and fun for the people,\" Bun B said. \"I wanted the players to have a good time and know that we watch them, we see what they're doing and we know the hard work that they put in and we're happy to see it pay off now.\"\n3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
