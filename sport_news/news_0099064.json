On Tuesday, defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson said the Jets are salivating at the thought of getting after Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and the Patriots. \"He's run this division for a while so I am kind of happy we get next,\" Richardson told reporters. \"We're getting after it.\" Richardson didn’t specify whether he was talking about Brady or Belichick, but added, \"I mean, they are the Super Bowl champions. Just leave it at that. You know, licking our chops.” Entering this week, the Jets defense is ranked first in the NFL, allowing 1,346 total yards. Their secondary – led by Darrelle Revis – is second, allowing an average of 186.6 passing yards. Their run defense is also ranked second, allowing an average of 82.6 yards. Belichick said the Jets, under new first-year head coach Todd Bowles, are running a defensive scheme that is similar to the Ryan-coached unit of years past. “They have a lot of talented players. … It’s really pretty much the same defense,” Belichick said. “They put pressure on you. There’s a good amount of pressure with extra linebackers and then there are times when they bring secondary players as well. I’d say that’s consistent with what they did in Arizona and even a little bit in Miami, so not really anything dramatically different from what we’ve seen from them in the past, but they are doing it very well and they have good players at every position, so that will definitely be a big challenge for us.” Added Danny Amendola: \"It’s a big game. I’ve been a part of this team for going on my third year now. The first thing I heard was that the Jets play hard. That’s no doubt. We’ll be ready this week.\" Addition and subtraction Some reinforcements could be on their way for the Patriots. As the team enters Week 7, it can now remove players from the physically unable to perform list. For the Pats, that means they could be getting some help soon in the form of wide receiver Brandon LaFell, defensive tackle Chris Jones and linebacker Dane Fletcher. Belichick was asked Tuesday if the team will activate LaFell and have the receiver practice this week. “Yeah, we probably will,” he responded. Teams now have a five-week window to let PUP players practice. Once they do, a 21-day countdown starts. In that time frame, a team must either add the player to its 53-man roster or return the player to the PUP list for the rest of the season. LaFell had a breakout season last year, finishing with a career-high 74 catches, 953 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. The wideout has traveled with the Patriots in the past two weeks to Dallas and Indianapolis. He worked out on the field before each kickoff. When the Patriots activate any of the three players, they’ll have to release someone from their 53-man roster, so some tough cuts could be forthcoming. Belichick added that his staff is still debating what to do with the three players. “We’ll talk about that a little bit later today when we get with the trainers and see how the workouts went today, and so forth,” Belichick said. “It’s definitely something that we will be talking about now with players that are in that category, but we haven’t made a final decision on that.” We’ll learn more today when the team holds its first practice of the week. Slater's status Matthew Slater made a brief appearance in the locker room on Tuesday and looked like he was walking and standing without any trouble. The special-teams captain suffered a leg injury in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s game. He had to be carried off the field by his teammates. Slater sat on the bench with his head in his hands for a few moments. He was also seen after the game being carted around inside Lucas Oil Stadium. Slater declined to talk to the media on Tuesday. Along the lines The Patriots are adding more depth to their offensive line. On Tuesday, the team signed Brennan Williams to the practice squad. The 6-foot-6, 314-pound tackle was a third-round pick of the Houston Texans in 2013. He hails from North Easton, Mass., and was last seen in training camp with the Jacksonville Jaguars. The 24-year-old hasn’t appeared in an NFL game. He underwent microfracture surgery on his knee during his rookie season and was released in 2014 with a failed physical designation. He was released by the Jaguars at the end of camp in August. The Patriots could use a little extra help at tackle. Last week they put Nate Solder on injured reserve and promoted Cameron Fleming from the practice squad. After starter Marcus Cannon left Sunday’s game with a toe injury, Fleming played 84 percent of the offensive snaps. The Patriots still have one practice spot open.
