Their race to the finish line begins Friday night against Liberty at Bethlehem Area School District Stadium. \nIf Easton wins one or more of the games, it should be enough to lock up a spot in the Districts 2/4/11 Class AAAA subregional field. \n“We remind them on a Saturday morning where everyone stands (in the playoff race) and what’s in store for them if we win and what’s in store if we lose,” coach Steve Shiffert said. \nRELATED : Easton's Nate Moser experiencing the 'life of a cornerback' \nBut with Freedom and Nazareth looming after the Hurricanes Friday night, there’s no room for a letdown game in the final stretch. \n“The competition is there every play, every game,” Shiffert said. “That’s what makes teams good – the ones that stand up to that every down, every play.” \nThe first challenge for Easton is Liberty, led by senior quarterback Doug Erney and his deep stable of talented wide receivers. The Red Rovers kept Parkland dual-threat QB Devante Cross somewhat in check last week and will need a similar performance from their defense Friday. \n“The biggest thing with Liberty is they spread it around more,” Shiffert said. “Their quarterback is no different than Cross, he’s an excellent passer and he loves to run with the ball. … You gotta have 11 guys playing disciplined football. We’re going to see that style of offense from here on out. We’ve got it for three weeks in a row coming up.\" \nEaston’s own quarterback, senior Trey Durrah , took a few hits in the Parkland game and had to come out for a few snaps in the fourth quarter. But he should be good to go come Friday, according to his coach. \n“He’s banged up a little bit, but he’s running better at this point in the week,” Shiffert said. \nEaston player to watch: Justin Swick . The senior defensive back has been all over the field for the Red Rovers, racking up 14 tackles, 4.5 of which have gone for a loss. He’ll need to play with that same wherewithal against a Liberty offense that can move the ball with ease when it gets into a rhythm. \nLiberty player to watch: Darian Street . The junior wide receiver, who recently picked up an offer from Pitt, has been one of Erney’s most dependable targets. He’s a dynamic playmaker that can beat a defensive back, or do some damage in yards after catches as well. \nEaston will win if … it can eliminate the mental mistakes it had too many of against Parkland. The Red Rovers play well enough defensively on most nights to win, but need to take care of the ball and cut down the penalties that have doomed them. They’ll also need a balanced offensive attack – the Hurricanes have been solid defending the run. \nLiberty will win if … it can keep the ball moving on offense and fend off the Easton defensive attack. The Hurricanes’ offensive line will need to protect Erney and open holes for the run game like it did against Parkland. If they get a lead, they’ll also need to keep building on it instead letting the Red Rovers hang around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:08:10.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
