He's a good goaltender; he's proven that over many years.\" \nHextall said he did not expect Mason to be away for an extended period but did not know if the goalie would return Wednesday for the home game against Chicago. Hextall declined to say whether the matter weighed on Mason before the game Saturday, when the steady goalie allowed an uncharacteristic four goals in the first 6 minutes, 46 seconds of the loss to Florida. \nJason LaBarbera was recalled from the Phantoms to serve as Neuvirth's backup. Flyers debuts \nDefenseman Radko Gudas and right winger Sam Gagner played in their first games with the Flyers Monday as the team switched up the lineup. Gudas replaced Luke Schenn, who was a healthy scratch. The Flyers acquired Gudas in March from Tampa Bay. He missed most of last season with a knee injury. \n\"He brings an element, a little bit of snarl,\" Hakstol said. \nGagner filled in for R.J. Umberger, who is day-to-day with an upper-body injury. Gagner played on Sean Couturier's second line and was used on the power play. \n\"I think everyone is confident that he can step in and help us,\" Hakstol said. No Snider \nFlyers chairman Ed Snider missed the game as he chose to remain at his home in California, where he is resting after recent medical therapy. Snider's involvement in team and company operations is not affected, the team said in a statement. \nLast year, a Flyers official said Snider was battling a treatable cancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:14:42.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
