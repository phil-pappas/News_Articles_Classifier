He couldn't wait to get started. \nDebates have raged about his propensity to make headlines, his punctuality on workout days, his desire to protect his precious right arm at the urging of agent Scott Boras. Controversy has obscured his immense talent. Latest Mets stories Mets, Jets, Rangers all home on fluky Sunday \nBut on Saturday night, in the Mets' 4-2 victory over the Cubs in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, there would be no forgetting why the Mets endured great pains to ensure that he would be ready for his moment.

He departed after allowing Kyle Schwarber's fourth homer of the postseason, a solo shot that landed deep in the Cubs' bullpen. Still, he walked off to a rousing ovation with the Mets ahead 4-2. \nTwo days after pitching the last two innings of the NLDS-clinching win over the Dodgers, Jeurys Familia recorded the final four outs against the Cubs.

He fed off the energy of 44,287 fans gathered at Citi Field for the Mets' first NLCS game since 2006 and first-ever playoff game against the Cubs. \nFor the sixth time this season, and the first time since Aug. 11, Harvey pitched into the eighth. He struck out nine, egged on by those who stood and waved orange towels whenever he got to two strikes. \nLittle could rattle Harvey -- not even a line drive off the bat of Dexter Fowler that smashed into his right triceps -- on the way to working past a handful of bad breaks to put the Mets in position to beat the Cubs. \nHarvey's first postseason start had been a slog. In a 13-7 victory over the Dodgers in NLDS Game 3, he never looked comfortable, allowing three runs in five innings. \nAfter the game, Terry Collins said he'd never seen him work harder to grind through a start. \"I just saw a guy who hasn't been out there consistently,\" Collins later said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:39:45.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
