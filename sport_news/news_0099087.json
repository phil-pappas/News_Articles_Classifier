Today Manager Louis van Gaal and team Captain Wayne Rooney met the media to preview the match. Here are some of the main takeaways. \nVan Gaal says the Champions League schedule has given City a slight advantage in preparation for what should be an epic Manchester Derby on Sunday. \n“Every club at the top of the league has the same problems. But now Manchester City has a benefit because they are playing at home [on Wednesday] and that is a difference,” the United manager said. “You have the benefit of the recuperation. Manchester City don’t have the travel we have so they have more rest. \n“There is nothing you can do. They have the benefit. We do a lot of things to try and help. We have cold baths, we have warm baths, less training sessions and practice so the freshness is good enough to beat City. But first we have to beat Moscow.” \nHowever, Van Gaal said he’s not looking ahead to the derby, he’s instead focused on the match tonight. \n“For me, as a manager, the next match is the most important match. I don’t think about Man City. I only think about CSKA Moscow and I have to focus on this match. \n“I demand that also from my players. We have already lost one game against PSV away and we want to gain one point at least. That is why it is a very important match for us.” \nHe also said that he’s willing to take a draw in this match. (Here’s more on that) \nRooney was asked what he’d like for his birthday, as he turns 30 today, and he gave “the yearbook answer,” the most canned of all responses: \n“If we start with three points tomorrow then that would be great, and then another three on Sunday.” \nRooney adds: “For me, he is a fantastic player and a fantastic team-mate. He is a player who is very tough to get around. For him to be from Argentina and play in the Premier League is not easy but he has done a great job. \n“He will be a very important player for us for the rest of the season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:24:37.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
