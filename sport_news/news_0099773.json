Players cannot switch models during the round. The penalty is known as a one-hole adjustment to the match. \nHowever, the referee was wrongly told that Mickelson was disqualified from the hole for using a different ball. In fact, Mickelson should have been allowed to finish the hole and then the adjustment would be made. \nJason Day, playing with Adam Scott, made birdie and won the hole to go 1 up. And then the one-hole adjustment made it 2 up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:03:16.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
