They’ll be very scrappy. They’ll put it on you to either score or give them points. They have the ability to score from every position.” \nThe Trojans, defending PIAA Class AAA champs, of course, have the ability to inflict punishment from anywhere as well. \nCOMPLETE COVERAGE : Parkland, Liberty advance to EPC girls volleyball final \nTheir five seniors are well known: Kristin Krause, Siena Salvaggio, Avery Perosa, Sam Webber and Erika Foose. Mike Krause has been pleased with the contributions from younger players Morgan Sherwin, Kirah Dreisbach, Megan Shaw and Grace Steurer, too. \nLiberty’s lineup is not nearly as senior-centric. Senior setter Maddie Capuano is distributing the ball, but beyond her the Hurricanes turn to juniors Amanda Rachwal, Sydney Wilson, Taylor Rezac and Kristin Kaleycik, sophomore Grace Mittl and freshman Lina Perugini. \nHurricanes coach Missy Lynn feels her team has evolved since the third game of the campaign. \n“It shined a spotlight on our weaknesses, which we’ve been working on all season long,” she said. “I think that we’re a better team than we were at the beginning of the year.” \nObstructing Parkland’s powerful swings will be a high priority. \n“Hopefully, we can slow their hits down,” Lynn said. “If we can slow their hits down, our defense can pick up the balls.” \nFoose was impressed with what she saw from Liberty. \n“I think they are a very, very good defensive team,” the senior said. “I see them flying on the court. It blows my mind, actually. I think it’s going to be a challenge for us to try to put the ball down. We’re going to have to step up our game a lot and it’s going to be an exciting match.” \nUpsetting the Trojans and earning a conference title would be a gigantic accomplishment for the 2015 ’Canes and the program as a whole. Mike Krause knows what’s at stake for the opposition. \n“I think Liberty is going to come in with something to prove to its own program,” he said. “They’ve grown so much under Missy. This is something where they can really measure themselves … They’re going to have a lot of energy, which is the way it should be.” \nThe enthusiasm is a certainty, whether there’s been enough progress to test Parkland’s fortified position atop the EPC remains to be seen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:09:31.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
