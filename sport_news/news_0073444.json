The YMCA is slated to operate the building, scheduled to open early next year. \n“Everybody is welcome in the YMCA,” Mayer said. \nIn talking about the experience of the YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap, LaRue wanted to make clear the Sammamish YMCA is a completely separate organization. Mayer said as the local YMCA is starting with a brand new building, it is in a great position to create private locker room and shower spaces. \nThe issue was never one of discrimination against the transgender community, LaRue said. The concerns revolved around nontransgender persons abusing the policy and using the locker room or shower room of the opposite sex for unwelcome reasons. \n“We are a member-driven organization,” LaRue noted. “We had over 1,000 comments.” \nIn October, in response to all those comments, the YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap changed its policy for family YMCAs. The Y’s website spells out the new policy. \nTransgender members in transition will use private locker rooms for dressing and showering at designated family YMCAs. At adult-oriented facilities, transgender persons may continue to use locker rooms and restrooms that align with their gender identification. \n“The Y is actively assessing our locker room practices to ensure they meet the needs of all our members,” wrote Bob Ecklund, president and CEO of the YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap Counties. “This includes ensuring children are not exposed to inappropriate nudity.” \nThere was some backlash from the transgender community regarding the rule change, LaRue said. \n“This seems like this is a situation where we are not going to make everyone happy,” LaRue added. “So far, it seems to be a reasonable solution.” \nOne other issue LaRue mentioned is that the law is largely silent regarding what is or isn’t required or allowed in such situations. The issue is new enough that the legalities haven’t caught up with reality. \nMayer said he had not heard from anyone in the community with concerns about the new Sammamish YMCA. He reiterated that he hopes any issues that do arise can be handled with respect and dignity for all involved. \n“Everyone is welcome at the Y,” he stressed. \n\nWritten by Tom Corrigan · Filed Under Local News \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:38:00.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
