EAST RUTHERFORD – Sheldon Richardson missed the first four games of the season, so perhaps he can be excused for forgetting the Jets made a coaching change last January.\nThe Jets’ 34-20 victory over a depleted Washington team Sunday gave them their first 4-1 start since 2010 and set up an AFC East showdown with New England next Sunday. The Patriots (4-0) visited Indianapolis on Sunday night.\nWhen asked about the Patriots, most Jets echoed Todd Bowles’ ho-hum declaration of “We have Game 6 [of the season] against New England, and we’ll play Game 6.”\nNot Richardson, even if his replies didn’t quite reach the level of Rex Ryan’s typical Patriots-related bombast.\n“He’s run this division for a while now,” Richardson said, “so I’m kind of happy we get next. We’re getting after it.”\nIt was unclear to whom Richardson was referring to when he said “he,” although he likely meant veteran quarterback Tom Brady. However, he also could have meant coach Bill Belichick.\n“I mean, they are the Super Bowl champions, too,” Richardson said. “Just leave it at that. You know. Licking our chops.”\nOther Jets didn’t stray from their coach’s message, just as Bowles almost surely would prefer.\n“It’s just another game. That’s how we have to approach it,” said wide receiver Brandon Marshall, who atoned for a lost second-quarter fumble that led to a Washington field goal by making a brilliant catch of an underthrown Ryan Fitzpatrick pass for a 35-yard score.\n“For us, it’s another game,” Marshall added. “I’m going to enjoy this one and then I’ll get to New England” today.\nRight guard Willie Colon said of the Patriots, “They seize every opportunity they have. They play well. They play at a high level. They don’t make excuses. If you don’t bring your ‘A’ game, you’re going to get embarrassed.”\nSo then this is a statement game for the Jets, right?\nNo, Colon said, adding, “I feel if you say that, you’re disrespecting the Buffalo Bills, you’re disrespecting the Miami Dolphins. They’re all worthy opponents.”\nFortunately for the Jets, the injury-plagued Redskins (2-4) were not worthy. Still, despite being without six starters due to injuries, Washington led, 13-10, at halftime, converting three New York turnovers into all 13 of its points.\nNeedless to say, Bowles wasn’t a happy man at halftime.\nRichardson was asked to describe the coach’s message at intermission.\n“Pick it up,” Richardson said. “We’re a better team than that. We know it. So go out and be who we are. Our best is not their best. It just means we’re better than them. It’s just that simple. We should be playing better. It shouldn’t even be close. And just leave it at that. Stop doing little things like sticking the ball out and getting it stripped from you. Protect the ball and make sure they’re not scoring off turnovers.”\nThe Jets did that for the most part, as Fitzpatrick’s 18-yard touchdown scramble in the third quarter put them ahead to stay, 20-13. It came on the next play after Darrelle Revis’ game-changing interception of Kirk Cousins. Revis had been beaten badly for a 2-yard TD catch by Pierre Garcon in the first quarter, but in the third quarter he baited Cousins into a poor decision and a worse throw, flipping the momentum.\nFitzpatrick threw two second-half scoring passes, including a 2-yarder to Eric Decker.\nMarshall said, “Obviously, we’re happy with our performance in the second half, but the thing I love about our team is when it’s not the way we want it, guys aren’t satisfied. … We made a lot of mistakes, especially on the offensive side, and we’ve got to get better.”\nNo doubt, because the kind of performance the Jets had Sunday likely won’t cut it against the perennial AFC East champions. Even after taking a 21-point lead, the Jets suffered a blocked punt for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, capping a mistake-filled day.\n“It’s going to be a battle next week,” said ex-Patriot Revis, who didn’t want to discuss his history with New England. “We’re familiar with them, and they’re familiar with us. It’s going to be a great game.”\nEmail: pelzman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:59:31.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
