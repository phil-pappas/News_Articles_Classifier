Gabe Heller's individual crown only added to the Cavaliers' exuberance. \nAfter finishing second last season, Aberdeen Roncalli senior Gabe Heller approached the state \"A\" golf tournament with one goal in mind, winning. The Cavaliers' ace shot an opening round 80 and was tied for sixth place, but carded an even-par 72 on the final day of play to rally past the field and win by three strokes. \n\"To win it finally is a nice thing as a senior to cap off the season and year with a win,\" Aberdeen Roncalli senior Gabe Heller said. \n\"I saw it coming. I believed in the kid from the moment I met him. I've known his family for a long time. He's a high-caliber player and he showed up when it counted,\" Aberdeen Roncalli head coach Ryan Patnoe said. \nThe state title has been a work in progress for Heller, who was handed the game at an early age. \n\"My dad put a golf club in my hand when I was like seven, so ever since then I've adopted the love of the game and just kept going up from there,\" Heller said. \nAs satisfying as the championship is for Heller, the team title means so much more. \n\"The team is most important to me. That's all I care about. Those guys are my best friends and we'll always be a part of the history of Roncalli, and they'll always be my family, no matter what,\" Heller said. \nThe title is also significant to first-year head coach Ryan Patnoe. \n\"It's kind of a shock to me. This is my first year coaching, so I can't believe we're state champions after the first year I've been here,\" Patnoe said. \nAs for Heller's future plans, he's looking at colleges and plans to go wherever the wind takes him.
