Lucas Casás For the Sentinel FSU's Dalvin Cook is following in the footsteps of Devonta Freeman, his former teammate at Miami Central High. \nHigh school freshmen often look up to their older teammates. They watch and learn the tips and tricks, the skills and secrets to go from backup to starter and beyond. \nAs a freshman in high school, Dalvin Cook learned from Davonta Freeman what it took to be successful. He watched as Freeman carried Miami Central High to the 2010 6A state championship, his 308 yards and three touchdowns lifting Central over Orlando Dr. Phillips, before heading Florida State. That time with Freeman offered lessons that Cook carries with him to this day. \n“We had three playoff games and he rushed for a thousand yards. Just the drive to get up and do it every game, to take care of his body and get back out there and run for 300 more yards,” Cook said. “I learned that from him.” \nFor all the great running backs to come through Tallahassee, none have been able to eclipse 1,000 yards rushing since Warrick Dunn in 1996. Freeman became the first Seminole in more than a decade to do it in 2013 and Cook made it two years in a row with a 1,000-yard rusher as a freshman the next season. \nAnd as Freeman continues to set the NFL on fire – he has nine touchdowns in six games this year for the Atlanta Falcons – Cook has been doing the same in the college ranks. Cook is just 45 yards short of 1,000 with at least six games left to play and is on various Heisman watch lists.

When Cook left the game because of the hamstring, Freeman gave him company by the training table. \n\n“It’s just the drive [Freeman] had in him. Don’t be denied,” Cook said. “It was all about determination with him and he came to practice and worked hard every day.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:24:54.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
