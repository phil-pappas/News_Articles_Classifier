(AP Photo/Gary Landers) more > By JOE KAY -   \nCINCINNATI (AP) - Hayden Moore threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score in his starting debut, and Cincinnati’s struggling defense held on for a 34-23 victory over Miami on Thursday night to end the Hurricanes’ streak of 10 straight wins over the Bearcats. \nThe redshirt freshman followed up the best passing game in Cincinnati history with a solid performance. The Bearcats (3-2) surged ahead 14-3 and overcame a scoreless third quarter behind Moore, who was 22 of 33 for 279 yards with an interception. \nMoore filled in with Gunner Kiel sidelined by a neck injury suffered during a 53-46 loss at Memphis a week earlier. Moore took over in that game and threw for a school-record 557 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions in only three quarters. \nMiami (3-1) was coming off a 36-33 win over Nebraska that featured five field goals by Michael Badgley. He made three more Thursday but missed from 51 and 53 yards as the Hurricanes repeatedly failed to reach the end zone. \nTrailing by 11 points, the Hurricanes went for it on fourth-and-goal from the 5 instead of taking the field goal. Brad Kaaya’s pass was incomplete with 4:41 left. Kaaya finished 24 of 39 for 255 yards without a touchdown or interception. \nTion Green’s 41-yard run then put Cincinnati in position to finish it off. Green had 90 yards on 15 carries. \nMoore got off to a solid start, leading the Bearcats to a 27-20 halftime lead. He completed his first three passes as Cincinnati pulled ahead 14-3, the first time the Hurricanes had trailed this season. After five straight completions, he threw an interception - hung the ball in the air too long - that set up a Miami touchdown. \nThe Bearcats had 300 yards in the first half, with Moore throwing for a touchdown and scoring on a 1-yard sneak. \nThe main point of emphasis for Cincinnati was avoiding turnovers. Cincinnati led the nation in turnovers coming into the game with nine interceptions and five fumbles. Miami has been among the best at forcing turnovers. \nAside from Moore’s first-quarter interception, the Bearcats avoided the big mistake. \nBoth defenses regrouped in the second half. The Hurricanes had 38 yards in the third quarter and missed a field goal, while Moore was sacked twice as the Bearcats managed only five net yards. \nMoore finally got going, Mekale McKay in stride for a 52-yard gain. He then threw a 7-yard touchdown pass for a 34-23 lead with 6:54 to go. The Hurricanes then had the chance to cut it to an 8-point game, but came up empty on the fourth-down incompletion. \nCincinnati’s offense was missing running back Mike Boone and receivers Johnny Holton and Chris Moore to injuries. \n___ \nFollow Joe Kay on Twitter: http://twitter.com/apjoekay \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:47:39.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
