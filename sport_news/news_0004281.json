As the school bus pulled into his Queens neighborhood, he soon got word from the folks who had spent that afternoon glued to their radios and televisions that the New York Mets won the National League title. \nThe 8-year-old hopped off the bus, skipping, then giddily ran along his block screaming, \"The Mets won the pennant! The Mets won the pennant!\" serving as herald for anyone within earshot. \nThat was in 1969, and those were the \"Miracle Mets,\" a crew of underdogs who had an improbable run to the franchise's first World Series after a sweep in the League Championship Series. \nGabriel's son reacted similarly on Wednesday evening, celebrating after the Mets, again on an improbable run, completed a sweep of the Chicago Cubs to advance to the World Series for the first time since 2000. The Mets, seeking their first championship since 1986, visit the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday for Game One. \nJerry Gabriel, too, felt inclined to share his excitement with the community, except his thumbs did the screaming. Something like this: #LGM. \nWhat followed the final out was a torrent of Facebook posts, texts, tweets and retweets about the Mets. In this age of social media, the bellowing voice can carry across the world. And that Twitter hashtag — short for \"Let's go Mets\" — can signal fans to gather online. \nNo longer does the conversation about \"last night's game\" have to wait until the following day or be limited to those hovering around the water cooler. The discussion occurs as the action unfolds, the glee and tension expressed in a line or two, and it can quickly spread to the masses. The water coolers now are handheld — we call them smartphones and tablets. Social media has evolved fandom into a 24-hour experience, in which fans can immerse themselves in team news, opinions and jokes at any time of the day. Editor's column: Mets and social media are rapid-fire fun \n\"When I was younger, if something happened in a game, I'd just say it to my dad,\" said Gabriel, 16, of Red Hook. \"But since I got Twitter, I can say it to everyone. Tweeting during games is like having a big conversation with a lot of people.\" \nWhen the Mets clinched the National League crown on Wednesday, there were a lot big conversations with a whole lot of people. Shortly after the deciding game, four of Twitter's top 20 trending topics were Mets-related. \nAbout 44 percent of Americans use another electronic device while watching TV, according to a survey conducted by the National Association of Television Program Executives. This is particularly so among millennials over the age of 13, who have one eye on the television and the other on a smaller screen, discussing what they just saw. \n\"Not everyone is viewing TV the same way we did 10 or 15 years ago,\" said Evan Auerbach, a social media strategist at DragonSearch, a Kingston-based digital marketing firm. \"The old-school model of 'me and my TV' is changing and people are seeking the second-screen experience. It's like a community in your palm, and fans of a show or a team like being able to share their thoughts with like-minded people.\" Can you master the Mets? Take a quiz \nJake Marshall successfully merged both worlds. Last Monday, ESPN's \"SportsCenter\" picked up his tweet and showed it on international television. \n\"@SportsCenter Mr. Daniel Murphy just because he's the new Mr. October!!!\" the 18-year-old Red Hook native tweeted from his @J_Marsh99 account. \n\"I was in school that morning and didn't see it, but one of my friends took a picture of it on TV and sent it to me,\" Marshall said. \"It was nuts. I was getting high fives in the hallway at school and giving hugs to random people.\" \nMarshall said he and several buddies tweet frequently about the Mets. Sure, they still gather often to watch games, but social media allows them to include the not-so-close friends — many they've never met. \nThey follow the beat reporters, the official Mets Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, those of individual players, and fan pages like \"The 7 Line Army\" and @InMetsWeTrust. There, one post can initiate a conversation with anyone from anywhere. It's like pen pals, sans the pen and postage. \nThroughout a season they'll toss about trade ideas or play manager and suggest lineup changes. Or, simply, share funny photos and videos. Vine clips and GIFs of Mets pitcher Bartolo Colon's awkward swings of the bat have gone viral. \nDuring the playoffs, as Murphy has clobbered home runs — his current streak of six consecutive postseason home runs is an all-time record — he has become the subject of several memes. A recent one is a photo of his head imposed on a goat, with double meaning. It's an allusion to the so-called \"Curse of the Billy Goat,\" which has supposedly denied the Cubs a championship for over a century. It also jokingly suggests that Murphy is the G.O.A.T., as in greatest of all time. \nWhen times are rough for the Mets — as they had been for nearly a decade — the fans can commiserate. Pain shared is pain lessened, right? And in times of great joy, excitement shared is excitement enhanced. \nJason Lawrence of Wappingers Falls shows off his Mets gear and fan towel. (Photo: Courtesy photo) \nWappingers Falls native Jason Lawrence said he watched the fourth game of the NLCS at his friend Louie Sinapi's home. In celebration, Sinapi's relatives popped bottles of champagne and drenched each other, spraying it all over their own living room. \"And they didn't care,\" said Lawrence, 18, a former baseball player at John Jay High School. \"That's how happy everyone was.\" \nHe then rushed to his phone to contact a few more friends: \"The New York Metropolitans are headed to the 2015 World Series. Yes. This is real life. This is the best moment of my life.\" That tweet, to his more than 1,000 followers, was followed by a string of retweets of Mets photos, videos and comments from other fans. \nA large percentage of Lawrence's 36,000 tweets are about his favorite team. During games, he said, he'll add commentary and jokes. He'll post photos of Marvel superhero Thor's hammer when Noah Syndergaard (nicknamed \"Thor\") records a strikeout. He attends at least 10 games a year, he said, and he'll post photos of Citi Field to his Instagram. He is fully immersed in social media. His parents, not so much. \n\"Someone posted a hilarious video of Bartolo (Colon) and I'm showing it to my dad,\" Lawrence said. \"'He goes, 'Shut that off! I'm trying to watch the game.'\" \nLikewise for Marshall, who said his mother, a Mets fan, doesn't understand why he \"can't just watch the game.\" \nLeslie Gabriel and his son, Jerry, enjoy a Mets game at Citi Field. (Photo: Courtesy photo.) \nThere is a bit of a generational divide, Auerbach said, with millennials growing up in a \"'first' culture,\" eager to share, analyze or spoof immediately. \n\"That's how media is consumed now and it'll continue in that direction,\" he said. \"People want to connect and everyone wants to feel like they're part of the conversation.\" \nAuerbach, too, is a diehard Mets fan, but he has gone into \"no social media mode\" in regards to his team in the playoffs. It's for superstitious reasons. But he is attempting to purchase World Series tickets, and if he's able to get them... \n\"I'd have to show those off,\" he said. \"That would go on Snapchat.\" \nStephen Haynes: shaynes@poughkeepsiejournal.com, 845-437-4826, Twitter: @StephenHaynes4 \nComing This week \nPick up the Journal on Tuesday for a complete preview of Game One of the World Series, and find commemorative photo pages of Mets stars throughout the week. \nWorld Series glance \nNew York Mets vs. Kansas City Royals \n(Best of seven series; games five, six and seven if necessary) \nGame One: Tuesday at Kansas City, 8 p.m. \nGame Two: Wednesday at Kansas City, 8 p.m. \nGame Three: Friday at New York, 8 p.m. \nGame Four: Saturday at New York, 8 p.m. \nGame Five: Sunday at New York, 8:15 p.m. \nGame Six: Nov. 3 at Kansas City, 8 p.m. \nGame Seven: Nov. 4 at Kansas City, 8 p.m. \nAll games televised on FOX and broadcast on WOR 710 AM 38 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pojonews.co/1S4QYLV TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:15:58.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
