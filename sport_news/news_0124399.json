But the success of the event will be measured by the amount wagered at simulcast centers several thousand miles away.\n“What we think is very big is the future of simulcasting,” said Tim Rooney, whose family has owned Yonkers Raceway since 1972. “Simulcasting domestically is not growing nearly as strongly as simulcasting internationally.”\nThe proliferation of casinos and state-run lotteries has largely turned harness racing into an afterthought in the United States. It remains quite popular overseas, though. Yonkers officials decided to tap into that market almost a year ago by offering some matinee racing on Sundays that is intended primarily for simulcast centers in France.\nPhoto The Yonkers Raceway site has been bustling since Empire City Casino opened in 2006 and began attracting more than eight million players annually.

Yonkers added to its overseas product by introducing afternoon racing on Tuesdays at the start of this year, with those cards generating as much as $500,000 abroad. The restoration of the International Trot represents the latest attempt by a modest track to extend its reach.\n“We think it’s the way to go,” said Bob Galterio, Yonkers’s chief operating officer. “At least it’s the way to try, because if we don’t do anything, we’re doomed to failure.”\nAlthough the Yonkers Raceway site has been bustling since Empire City Casino opened in 2006 and began attracting more than eight million players annually, the same visitors who keep slot machines whirring rarely venture outside to watch or wager on racing.\nThe International, in its first incarnation, ultimately fell victim to the plummeting interest in the sport. It was first run at Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury, N.Y., in 1959 and remained there until Roosevelt closed in 1988. Yonkers hosted the International for the next seven years before financial constraints caused it to drop the event.\nRooney began eyeing the return of the International almost as soon as money from Empire City Casino allowed for purse and other enhancements. “When we had the International before, Yonkers was highly thought of in international markets,” he said. “We’ve lost a little bit of that in the last nine years by not having the International. We’re hoping to get that back again.”\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nAnd it is spending heavily to do so, incurring expenses that will go far beyond the $1 million purse. The winner will receive $500,000 as part of a purse distribution that will extend through the first five positions. Overseas horses that fail to crack the top five will still receive a $37,500 payment for participating; those from North America who do not earn purse money will pocket $10,000. The race will be contested at a mile and a quarter, a common distance abroad but not in the U.S. and especially not at a half-mile oval like Yonkers’s.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The whatever-it-takes approach to making sure the International lives up to its name as a competition that attracts elite trotters from around the world may be worthwhile if Yonkers can turn a foothold in France into a broader acceptance of its simulcast signal. Fans through much of Europe and Scandinavia will be able to wager on the International.\n“With the decline in racing in the U.S., if we don’t branch out globally, we’re not taking advantage of a huge marketplace that is available to us,” said Joe Faraldo, president of the Standardbred Owners Association of New York. “If we don’t take advantage of that, we will not have an industry left.”\nYonkers officials succeeded in assembling a highly competitive field that includes standouts from Canada, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the United States. Bee A Magician, a 5-year-old mare with more than $3.6 million in earnings, will represent Canada. She is the 3-1 favorite from Post 5, largely because she has won three of four starts at Yonkers and broke her own record for aged mares competing at one mile with a 1:54.3 clocking there on Aug. 1. Mares historically fared well in the 36-year history of the International, with eight of them combining for 11 victories.\nTimoko, an 8-year-old trotter who owns 19 victories in 57 career starts for earnings of more than $3.7 million, will break from Post 4. He is so popular in France he has his own website. Owner Tom Andersen has high hopes for Norway’s Papagayo E, who will leave from Post 2 at 5-1.\nAndersen said of competing at Yonkers, “I hadn’t known I had this dream, but it seems to be fulfilled, to come to New York and compete against the best horses in the world.”\nLoading...
