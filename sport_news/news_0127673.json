The team rallied around each other and put on another dominating performance led by running backs Revell Williams and Basil Williams. \nBasil Williams got the scoring underway on his first carry of the game, breaking a 32-yard run and taking it to the end zone. \nHe said his blockers paved the way for him en route to his 106-yard night. \n“Our line had a big part of it,” he said. “They had a great game tonight, and our fullback, he set the tone. He came out hitting the linebackers giving me the hole to run through.” \nWith Mosley out for the game, the team used a next-man-up mentality. \n“Markquese stepped up at quarterback and other people had to step in and do their job,\" Revell Williams said. \nRevell Williams ripped off big runs of 81 and 33 yards, each going for touchdowns. He finished with 112 yards on three attempts. \nNot attempting a pass all night worked in the Bulldogs favor. \nHead coach Dave Ellen said simply, “If you don’t have to pass. You don’t.” \nThe only miscues the Bulldogs faced were four penalties and one big special teams play by the Tigers. Running back Jake Robb nearly took a kickoff to the house, but was stopped short at the 6-yard line. It was only three plays later when fellow running back Carl Carlson ran the ball two yards for the only Tiger touchdown. \nThe Bulldog defense was strong all night, allowing only 48 yards on the ground and six through the air. Bridgeton also forced a fumble, but didn’t recover it. \nThe Bulldogs will look to get above .500 next week against Millville. \n“We have a big game next week,” Basil Williams said. “We have to keep doing what we’ve been doing and getting better as the week goes on.” \nBridgeton 42, Lower Cape May 7 \nBridgeton (3-3) 14 20 8 0 - 42 \nL, Cape May (1-4) 0 7 0 0 - 7 \nScoring \nB: B.
