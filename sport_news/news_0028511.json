Goodell spoke about the NFL's failure to address domestic violence, sexual assault and drug abuse in the league. NEW YORK (AP) -- Twitter accounts for websites Deadspin and SB Nation were suspended by the social media platform Monday night after the NFL filed notices related to their use of copyrighted video highlights.\nAdChoices The NFL told The Associated Press that it requested Twitter ''disable links to more than a dozen pirated NFL game videos and highlights that violate the NFL's copyright,'' adding that it did not request that any Twitter accounts be disabled.\nThe NFL sent 18 Digital Millennium Copyright Act notices regarding the Gawker-owned Deadspin account, said Gawker social media strategist Terron Moore via Twitter.\nBoth suspended accounts regularly use GIFs of highlights from sporting events, including NFL games. The SB Nation account that was suspended, (at)SBNationGIF, specializes in such highlights.\nThe main Deadspin account was down for roughly an hour before being re-activated around 8 p.m. EDT, while (at)SBNationGIF was still suspended.\nBoth Deadspin and SB Nation still had NFL video highlights featured on their sites, and the Deadspin account still included posts with GIFs from NFL game broadcasts when it was re-activated.\nDeadspin, which doesn't hide its disdain for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, announced its return by tweeting a photo linking to a story titled ''The Many Horrible, Stupid Faces Of Roger Goodell: A Gallery Of Authoritarian Derp.''\nIn August, the NFL and Twitter announced a two-year content and advertising deal that expanded upon prior relationships between the league and the social media platform. The deal promised to funnel more NFL video highlights and pictures from games through Twitter, with the site using an automated formula to prominently display NFL tweets and related ads in the streams of accountholders likely to enjoy the information.\n---\nAP Pro Football Writer Barry Wilner contributed to this report.\n---\nOnline: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/AP-NFL", "http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://pro32.ap.org/poll"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:43:24.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
