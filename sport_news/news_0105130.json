The Friars completed a weekend sweep of the Buckeyes after Friday's 2-1 victory, improving their record to 4-0-1 and matching their start from the 2013-14 campaign, while the Buckeyes drop to 0-6-0. Nick Ellis (4-0-1) finished with 30 saves, including 16 in the middle period, for PC. Matt Tomkins turned away 26 shots for Ohio State. Trevor Mingoia posted a career-high three assists as the Friars had six different players score goals. Brandon Tanev got things rolling for the Friars just 4:30 into the first period as he collected the puck in the neutral zone, skated into the Buckeyes' zone and fired a shot from the top of the right circle that beat Tomkins high on the glove side. It was the senior's team-leading third goal of the season. Despite failing to convert on four power plays in the first period, the Friars continued to find success at 5-on-5 and added to their lead when Kevin Rooney notched his first of the season on a delayed penalty to put PC up 2-0. Ellis preserved the advantage, denying a streaking Anthony Greco twice from close range in the first. The lead grew to 3-0 with 1:26 left in the period when freshman Ryan Tait got his first collegiate goal on assists from Garrett Gamez and Josh Monk. Ellis withstood an onslaught in the beginning of the second period as three consecutive PC penalties forced the junior to make 10 saves. The Buckeyes eventually broke through with a short-handed tally when Tyler Lundey stuffed home a loose puck in the crease at 9:55. Just 1:03 later, John Gilmour restored the Friars' three-goal cushion as he buried the rebound of a Mingoia shot. Ohio State continued to claw back, this time with Luke Stork redirecting Kevin Miller’s backhand shot past Ellis with 1:24 left in the second. The Buckeyes outshot the Friars, 18-7, in the period. Things looked good for the Friars early in the third after Jake Walman and Mark Jankowski potted power-play goals just 39 seconds apart to put Providence up, 6-2. Jankowski had been forced to leave Friday night's game against the Buckeyes after he blocked a pair of shots in the second period. Undeterred, the Buckeyes struck for two quick goals in a span of 31 seconds, thanks to Matthew Weis and John Wiitala. Ohio State pulled its goalie late in the period, but the Friars couldn’t find the empty net for nearly three minutes. But it didn’t matter as crucial shot blocks and key saves from Ellis denied the Buckeye rally.
