Patty Murray, D-Wash., so he's presumably coming to Roseburg before or after.\nObama spoke at length about the shooting on Thursday, just hours after a gunman killed nine and injured nine before killing himself, and returned to the subject during a Friday press conference.\nIn both cases, Obama said it was not enough to offer condolences and said he would continue to press Congress to \"enact common-sense gun legislation.\"\nIn recent years, Obama has also consoled victims of mass shootings in Charleston, S.C., Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn.\n--Jeff Mapes\njmapes@oregonian.com\n503-221-8209\n@jeffmapes", "external_links": ["http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/obama-to-visit-seattle-for-patty-murray-fundraiser/"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:14:51.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
