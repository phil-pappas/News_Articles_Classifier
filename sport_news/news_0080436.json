Both police and the army will be deployed to patrol the streets of Male.”\nOfficial sources said four of the Vice-President’s associates were arrested shortly before Adeeb’s detention and were also being held on the prison island.\nYameen appointed Adeeb as his deputy three months ago after impeaching his original running mate Mohamed Jameel on charges of treason.\nHe had changed the Maldives’ Constitution to reduce the permissible age of a Vice-President from 35 to 30 so that Adeeb could be given the job. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:16:28.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
