We have a younger, more athletic team, and we have great flexibility to go on.”\n• Much has been made of the Nets basically being stuck in limbo for 2015-16 as they compete for a playoff spot while trying to set themselves up for free agency next summer, when they’ll have close to $40 million in cap room.\nProkhorov thinks the Nets – contrary to popular opinion – can surprise.\n“You see, I don’t want us to be in the mindset of focusing on next summer,” Prokhorov said. “I think we have a great opportunity to have good results this year in the East.”\nHe also hinted, as many have suggested, the team has big plans in free agency. They would love to get an audience with Kevin Durant, assuming the Oklahoma City star tests the open market, as expected.\n“We have a plan to search [for] opportunities,” Prokhorov said. “I don’t have to tell you guys about that. So, our task for the next season is that we’ll surprise our doubters.”\n• Prokhorov said talks are still ongoing with Forest City Enterprises over him purchasing the remaining 20 percent of the Nets and 55 percent of Barclays Center, allowing him to completely own both the team and arena, but no deal is in place yet. He also said there is work to be done on the team’s new television deal with the YES Network.\nProkhorov once again said he has “no plans to sell controlling interest of the team” – leaving open the possibility he could sell a minority stake, but remain the controlling owner.\n— Prokhorov, entering his sixth season as owner, was asked what he’s learned since taking over in May 2010.\n“I think basketball is a great sport, and the NBA is very, very competitive. I like it, and I enjoy every minute of it,” Prokhorov said.\nWas it harder than he expected it would be to win?\n“For Russians, the harder the better,” he said with a smile.\n  brooklyn nets ,  deron williams ,  jarrett jack ,  mikhail prokhorov", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:26:08.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
