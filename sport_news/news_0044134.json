Louisville won, 20-13. (Ethan Hyman/Raleigh News & Observer/TNS) By Joe GiglioRaleigh News & Observer (TNS) \nRALEIGH — There were enough positives in the second half of a loss to Louisville for N.C. State’s defense to build on for tonight’s game at Virginia Tech. \nThe Wolfpack held Louisville to three points and 77 yards on 31 plays in the second half of a 20-13 loss. The Cardinals went three-and-out on three of five possessions and completed just 2 of 10 passes for 13 yards. \n“They came out in the second half and played hard and played well,” defensive coordinator Dave Huxtable said of his unit. \nThe problem for Huxtable and the Wolfpack was the first half. The Cardinals scored 17 points, gained 229 yards (on 41 plays) and converted at will on third down. \nThe lesson for the first ACC road game of the season is quite clear, senior cornerback Juston Burris said. \n“We can’t just play well in the second half, we have to play all four quarters,” Burris said. \nLouisville freshman quarterback Lamar Jackson gave the Wolfpack fits in the first half last Saturday. Jackson ran for 102 yards, including a 68-yard touchdown, as the Cardinals built a 17-3 advantage. \nThere was some confusion on Jackson’s long touchdown run. Both defensive end Pharoah McKever and linebacker Airius Moore committed to the running back on the read option play, springing Jackson free. Once Jackson got into the secondary, he was able to outmaneuver safety Josh Jones and then outrun safety Hakim Jones. \nMore problematic for Huxtable was Louisville’s third-down success in the first half. The Cardinals were 6 of 10 on third down and on their second touchdown drive, were able to convert twice on passing plays when N.C. State’s safeties were too far off the ball. \n“We’re off at 10 yards, that’s not what’s being coached,” Huxtable said. “That’s just a mental mistake.” \nN.C. State had been one of the best defenses in the country on third down in the first four games. The Wolfpack had allowed only 9 of 48 conversions before the Louisville game. The Wolfpack still ranks No. 10 in the country in that category. \nVirginia Tech (2-3) is coming off one of the worst offensive performances in coach Frank Beamer’s 29-year tenure in a 17-13 home loss to Pittsburgh. The Hokies finished with 100 yards of total offense, their lowest output since Beamer’s first game in 1987. \nBut the Hokies have a mobile quarterback in junior Brenden Motley, who ran for 85 yards and touchdown two weeks ago at East Carolina, and could get a boost from the return of senior quarterback Michael Brewer. \nBrewer, who started every game and threw for 2,692 yards in 2013, broke his left collarbone in the season-opening loss to No. 1 Ohio State. Brewer threw for 139 yards and a pair of touchdowns to post Virginia Tech to a 17-14 halftime lead over the Buckeyes. He got knocked out early in the third quarter and has missed the past four games. \nThe Hokies went 2-2 without Brewer, who has been cleared to return against the Wolfpack. N.C. State expects to face both quarterbacks. \n“There are some plays with Motley that they wouldn’t run with Brewer,” senior defensive end Mike Rose said. “We’re going to prepare for both. If (Brewer) plays, we’ll be ready for him.” \nDespite Virginia Tech’s problems on offense last week, Rose expects the Hokies’ best effort. Coming off a disappointing loss of their own, Rose sees two teams in the same boat. \n“Both teams are going to be scrapping for survival at this point,” Rose said. \nThe only way for N.C. State to get back on track is with a complete defensive effort. Huxtable remains confident his group can learn from last week’s loss. \n“We had a little bit of setback, now we have to turn this week into a comeback,” Huxtable said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:02:58.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
