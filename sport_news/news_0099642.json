But on this day, the wide receiver also finished with four catches for 120 yards and a touchdown. A common theme for Edelman this season has been that he’s been very critical of himself after he’s torched an opposing secondary. Sunday’s game was the seventh time he cracked 100 receiving yards, but the performance was pretty constant from what we’ve seen from the wide out this season. In four games, Edelman has 34 catches for 399 yards and three touchdowns. When asked about focusing on his negative plays, he said his attitude comes from being coach by Bill Belichick his entire career. “I’m just trying to improve,” Edelman said. “Coach Belichick has been in the league for a long time. To see how he works, relentlessly still harder and harder every year, you see that, you’re naturally going to want to do that and try to get better every week. That’s what I try to do.” Of course, that doesn’t mean the wide out isn’t having any fun out there. “I’m having fun every year. It’s fun, but it’s business,” Edelman said. “It’s only four games. It gets fun a little later.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:36:09.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
