In his previous date with the Jays, the 11-year veteran went head-hunting, targeting Jays slugger Donaldson in particular and calling him “a little baby” afterwards. \nWith the Jays facing elimination in the best-of-seven series, Wednesday will be their opportunity to get back at the Royals starter at a most opportune time. \nFirst things first: If Volquez is anywhere near as precise and powerful as he was back at K.C.’s Kauffman Stadium, the Jays will almost surely make a hasty and embarrassingly quick departure from the series they were favoured to win. \nIn Game 1, Volquez’s fastball was routinely up in the 95-97 miles per hour range, a couple m.p.h. Faster than he normally delivers. It was enough to throw the Jays off and enough to pop the Royals out to a fast start. \n“The whole story the other day he was just so good,” Jays manager John Gibbons said on Tuesday. “He couldn’t have pitched any better. Really, he was just so good that he dominated us. Hopefully he’s not quite as good (on Wednesday) and maybe makes a few mistakes.” \nThis is what it has come down to for the Jays – a hitting attack that has been inconsistent and a pitching effort not post-season worthy. The Royals have been the opposite. \nAnd if those Royals think Monday’s Game 3 starter Johnny Cueto got a rough ride from the Rogers Centre crowd, expect the desperate home-town faithful to kick it up a notch for Volquez. That Aug. 2 contest here was memorable for many things (including the start of an 11-game Jays win streak) but also for the clash between Volquez and Donaldson. \nThe Jays third baseman was plunked on the shoulder in the first inning and pitched high and inside two innings later. Donaldson complained throughout and after, prompting Volquez to dump on him. \n“He can’t take it,” Volquez said at the time. “He was pimping everything he does. Somebody hits you, you’ve got to take it because you’re pimping everything you do.” \nGiven the way they’ve performed so far in the series, perhaps the Jays could use a little growl as elimination looms. In two Rogers Centre dates thus far, the Royals have kicked the Jays pitchers around the yard, scoring 22 runs on 30 hits. \nAs for Volquez, on Tuesday he was doing a little self pimping in advance of the big Game 4 start and opportunity to get his team the clinching blow. \n“That’s one of the best feelings in the world,” Volquez said of his Game 1 effort that in many ways set the tone for the series. “That day I was like ... I had a great feeling. I knew I’d pitch a really good game. I didn’t know it would end the way it ended. \n“I’ve just got to move forward, pitch (on Wednesday) and try to do my job. You’ve got to put that game in the past and see what happens.” \nFor the most part, the Royals have been careful to pretend that Aug. 2 fracas didn’t exist. The 5-2 win was a huge emotional boost for the Jays. While the Toronto bats have been inconsistent, the Royals have been getting some \n“I think it’s the ballpark, the ball just flies,” Volquez said. “It’s not like we’re playing in Kansas City and the ball doesn’t carry much. They can change the game with one swing. They’ve got a lot of power.” \nBOOMING BATS \nThe Kansas City Royals expected to be solid defensively in the ALCS, but the potent offence has been a pleasant surprise. \nAfter banging out 22 runs and 30 hits in Games 3 and 4 at the Rogers Centre, suddenly they are as dangerous as the Jays have been at the plate. \n“We were really focussed on being productive collectively,” Royals right fielder Alex Rios said. “And I guess we’re doing a pretty good job of that. Defensively we’ve been good, offensively we’ve been even better.” \nA former Blue Jay, Rios was three for three including a home run as part of the relentless Royals attack. \n“He’s had a number of really good games for us in the playoffs,” Kansas City manager Ned Yost said. “I don’t know. I just felt that Alex was going to have a great day today. I told him that before the game. \n“He sure did – the big home to give us the five-run lead and two more singles. Alex has worked really hard to get to this point this year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:47:16.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
