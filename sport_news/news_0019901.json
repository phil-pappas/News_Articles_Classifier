During a conference call today, Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels was asked, given the recent history between the teams and everything that unfolded after the AFC Championship game with the footballs, if the upcoming game was more personal, or had a little more of a personal edge?\nMcDaniels, on cue, made Sunday's game with the Colts sound pretty ordinary, if that's possible. But that's exactly how the Patriots want the game to sound.\n“I really don’t see it any different than each of the other games we’ve played. I think it’s a very good team. It’s a road game in a hostile environment in a place that’s tough to play on a Sunday night,\" McDaniels said. \"They’ve got new people, new personnel. Look, they want to beat us. We want to beat them. It’s not very complicated. But that’s the same thing it is every single week that you play in this league.\"\nMcDaniels then brought up a good point in that making it personal might impact how the players perform, and the thought of the Bills in Week 2 - being undisciplined and committing all those penalties - came to mind.\n\"It’s very difficult to get ready for the coaching staff, the schemes they use, the players that are on this team, the environment that you’re trying to compete in, trying to do your job in, and to allow really anything other than that to creep into your preparation, it’s going to take away from your performance,\" McDaniels said. \"Whether it’s this week, next week, two weeks from now . . . they’re all different challenges. They’re all really difficult. This game is really difficult to prepare for each week, that’s why it’s so hard to win. I think our focus is going to stay on this. I know mine is. I don’t really have anything to do with all that stuff. I don’t think really anybody in our building cares a whole lot about it at this point. We’ve got a challenge ahead of us. We’ve got a long work week. We’ve got a lot of things to get caught up on and get our players prepared to do. It should be a fun environment to play in . . . we’re going to go there and try and put forth our best performance. That’s where our focus is going to be this week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:17:45.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
