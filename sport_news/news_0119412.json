The Cultural Center never looked so good and the variety of scales of objects is nothing short of amazing. In high-ceilinged, large volume spaces, the large scales exhibited there look utterly splendid and in low-ceilinged, small volume spaces the appropriation of scaling down exhibits is equally mesmerizing. This is not to say that everything is wonderful but what is wonderful, is the energy that was apparent, to say nothing of the 3,500 people there on a weekday today enjoying the stimuli of the Biennial.\nSEND LETTERS TO: letters@suntimes.com . Please include your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes.\nI have never felt so good about being a native of this city and of its mayor’s and commissioner of cultural affairs’ commitment to engage Chicago, once again, to the heart and soul of architectural ideation. I am humbled to witness the work of the youngest generation, whose intellectual zest is only surpassed by their optimism. It is a great thing to wake up knowing that Chicago is once again in the vanguard and I for one will be forever grateful to Sarah Herda and Joseph Grima and in the leadership of the body politic, namely Rahm Emanuel and Michelle Boone, for their bold if not daring support as we make our way through the 21st century.\nSome years back, when I first evinced support for the next generation of architects by exploiting the notion of “passing the baton,” I never frankly dreamed just how visionary they would be in actuality. My job is done because it is clear that this group has coalesced into a vital force as a collective change agent.\nStanley Tigerman, Loop\nFor Cubs, time is now\nI have been a fan of the Chicago Cubs since 1976 and am in complete agreement with Rick Telander’s column of Oct 8. The St. Louis Cardinals are the Sith Lords of baseball and now is the time for the Cubs to end the decades of futility.\nAs Telander pointed out, the Cardinals win with incredible consistency. They are the best. They have what we want, and they won’t give it up willingly. Just as the Bulls had to take it from the Pistons 25 years ago, the Cubs will have to take what the Cardinals have. If the Cubs want to be the best, we have to beat the best. The Cubs have earned the right to contest for the top spot in the division and the entire National League. Now go out there and take it!\nGerald Shinn, Pilsen\nStunned and disappointed\nI must say the the news of the promotion of Constantine G. Dean Andrews by Police Supt. Garry McCarthy left me both stunned and disappointed.\nAndrews was in charge of the re-investigation into the death of young David Koschman. In the course of that investigation, it was determined that words were added to the report that were never spoken by the victim. Words that made it look like David was the aggressor and the offender was acting in self-defense. Conjured-up words by the police investigators.\nI’m at a loss as to which one occurred here , nd we may never know. Was it false official reports, lack of courage, lack of supervision, obstruction of justice, official misconduct, blind ambition? What message is being sent out here by McCarthy? Blind ambition will get you a big-time promotion down the line?\nThe men and woman of the Chicago Police Department deserve to know that their leaders take seriously that motto of, “We serve and protect.”\nBob Angone, South Loop\nBetrayal of trust\nVolkswagen’s CEO, Martin Winterkorn recently resigned amid discoveries that his company lied and cheated regarding the claims it made pertaining to emission control devices on its cars.\nRegardless of what facts may emerge in this frustrating, disappointing case, the following observations apply.\nBetrayal of trust and abuse of power are rife, and apparently central in this lamentable, preventable debacle.And, perhaps most important, is that Volkswagen executives did not attend to the age-old, profound wisdom: If one does not pay meticulous, scrupulous attention to one’s boundaries (whether personal, political, professional, occupational, or otherwise), all relationships risk ruin.\nLeon J.
