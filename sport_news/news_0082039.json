The Pioneers held the momentum going into halftime, leading 24-13. \nBut the second half was all Jaguars. \nBoulder Creek took a three-point lead, 27-24 late in the third quarter to put pressure on the Pioneer offense behind freshman quarterback Spencer Rattler. Pinnacle got two touchdowns, one accompanied by a two-point conversion to give the Pioneers a one-possession lead with six minutes on the clock. \nWith just over a minute to play, Boulder Creek runningback Willie Muller got a touchdown, but the extra point was missed. The Pioneers took the victory formation on the next drive, but hung their heads on the sideline. \nBoulder Creek has yet to win a game this season, but quarterback Gunther Johnson thinks the tides can change next week. \n\"Although we lost, it feels great how we played, and we're for sure going to carry that into next week. Next week we'll get our first 'W'.\" \nBoulder Creek (0-7) will face Horizon (0-6) next week, and Pinnacle (4-3) will face Centennial (4-2).
