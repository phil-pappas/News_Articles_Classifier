(John McDonnell/Post) \nWhile Ohio State running back Ezekiel Elliott garnered more headlines by passing the 3,000 yard career rushing mark last week against Penn State, a true freshman from Coplay, Pa., named Saquon Barkley continued to blossom in the Heisman Trophy candidate’s shadow. Barkley has quickly become a star for the Nittany Lions, not just for his production but also for his flair. \nThe lasting image of his 194-yard performance against Ohio State came in the fourth quarter, when after shuffling through two levels of the defense, Barkley dashed across midfield as a Buckeyes defender tried to pull him down by his undershirt. \nBarkley eventually sprang free for another memorable run, which despite coming in a losing effort, wasn’t lost on the Maryland coaches and players who stayed up late to watch the game in College Park. Maryland’s defense hung its hat on the fact that it held Elliott to just 106 yards in a 49-28 loss to the Buckeyes two weeks ago, but the unit wore down in the late stages of the game. The key this week? Treat Barkley with as much respect as Elliott in preparation, which entered the 10th day on Wednesday after a bye last week. \n“I feel like he may be just as good [as Elliott],” said Maryland linebacker Jermaine Carter Jr. of Barkley, who has rushed for 597 yards in five games and is averaging 8.3 yards per carry. He finished with 194 yards on 26 carries against Ohio State. \n“In the Big Ten you’re going to face good backs week in and week out. I don’t want to compare anybody to anybody but I think he’s a very good running back with great speed and great power,” Maryland Defensive Coordinator Keith Dudzinski said. \nMaryland’s defense currently ranks second to last in the Big Ten in yards allowed (457.7) and is allowing 196. 8 yards per game on the ground. Promising starts against Michigan and Ohio State have both been spoiled by the unit’s inability to close in late-game situations, which Dudzinski has struggled to put his thumb on in recent weeks. He was careful not to label the unit’s second-half struggles (Maryland has been outscored 50-14 in the last two weeks) as endurance related, but he has made a point to remind the players of the issue as it has prepared for Penn State. \nThe unit is also in flux in the wake of the firing of assistant coach Lyndon Johnson, who worked with the team’s outside linebackers. Graduate assistant A.J. Reisig has stepped in to help fill the void with those duties, Dudzinski said Wednesday. \n“We’re making it work,” he added. \nCarter Jr., who is second in the Big Ten with 10.5 tackles per game, said the key to stopping Barkley is staying disciplined with the run-fit. While Maryland must account for quarterback Christian Hackenberg, who attempted only 13 passes against Ohio State, Barkley’s ability was more of a talking-point on Wednesday. \n“You have to get up there and get your shoulder on him and get the rest of the guys to rally,” Dudzinski said. “He can make you miss and then he can hit the home run as well.” Roman Stubbs covers the University of Maryland athletics for The Washington Post. sports Success!
