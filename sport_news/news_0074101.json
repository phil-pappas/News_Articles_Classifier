Team needs were sometimes, but not always taken into account. We played fast and loose with that because it’s still quite early. So many of these picks are “Best player available.” \n“Fail for Cardale.”“Get Sacked and Worse for Hackenberg.”“Lose-ah for Bosa.” Whatever your slogan, let the NFL Draft tanking begin. \n1. Detroit, Robert Nkemdiche, DT/DE, Ole Miss \nNever mind the Lions victory over the Bears today, when the season wraps up, Detroit will be still be the embarrassment of the NFL. The LOLions are back, and looking locked and loaded to be on the clock at #1. (regardless of today’s bizarre, controversial victory) \nGetting to the prospect, you’re just not supposed to move like Nkemdiche does when you’re his size. You just can’t. He sometimes looks super-human on film, like Jadeveon Clowney or Ndamukong Suh did when they were coming out of college. \n2. San Francisco, Jared Goff , QB, California \nGoff goes really overlooked because people don’t stay up late to watch those Pac 12 games, and Cal has been so down for so long. However, Goff is a star in the making, and he’s shown a mastery for a high-powered complex offense that will make him very pro ready. Sonny Dykes’“The System” and its up-tempo “bear raid” offense has helped Goff flourish. Jared made big strides in 2014; putting up an impressive 35-7 TD-INT ratio for the season. Yes, Goff looked awful in the ESPN College Gameday contest, but one atrocious half of football does an NFL Draft stock make. Niners stay local here. \nFor more on Jared Goff, click he re \n3. Jacksonville, Joey Bosa , DE, Ohio State \nBosa is as blue-chip a prospect as you’ll ever find. The Big Ten didn’t have anyone taken in the top ten 2008-2014. (Although they did provide the 11th overall selection both last year and in 2009). The streak ended end this April when Iowa’s Brandon Scherrf went to Washington with the fifth overall selection. I’m not at all worried about the suspension, due to a marijuana offense reported ESPN. When the time comes, that will be ancient history. \nFor more on Joey Bosa go here \n4. Chicago, Jalen Ramsey , S, Florida State \nSuch a weak safety class in 2015. It was truly broke, and 2014 wasn’t anything special either. Now, finally in 2016 we’ll see a legit blue-chip safety prospect for this ultra pass happy league. Ramsey is more than that. He can play corner effectively too. So now with Ramsey, and this year’s first round pick, Kevin White breaking into the league, the Bears look more mediocre, and less awful in 2016. \nGo here for more on Ramsey \n5. Tennessee, Ronnie Stanley , OT, Notre Dame \nNotre Dame Coach Brian Kelly talked about Stanley’s leadership following the Irish upset of LSU in the Music City Bowl: “The will started with Ronnie Stanley, Ronnie today was extremely vocal, and it kind of lit a fire under everybody, and carried over. Ronnie’s not a big talker, but he kind of got charged up and it seemed to elevate everybody. “ \nStanley has started 26 consecutive games for Notre Dame dating back to the start of the 2013 campaign. He started all 13 games at right offensive tackle as a sophomore. He was part of an offensive line that allowed just eight sacks and ranked second in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision in fewest sacks allowed. \nGo here for more on Ronnie Stanley \n6. New Orleans, Laquon Treadwell, WR, Ole Miss \nThere was a lot of talk that the Saints were going to draft Drew Brees’ successor in 2015. Those reports also indicated that it might happen in 2016 instead. Again I think they’ll pass on signal caller and go best player available. \n7. Baltimore, Vernon Hargreaves III, CB, Florida \nIn today’s NFL, you can never have enough pass-rushers, pass-protectors or elite pass-defenders. The best of the best at those positions will always have a premium placed upon them. Hargreaves is the elite corner of this class; and a slam dunk top ten selection. Also, the Ravens need help in the secondary. The group has mad some depth issues and injuries. \nGo here for more on Hargreaves \n8. Kansas City, Taylor Decker , OT, Ohio State \nBig Ten Players. OTs. Yes, there’s a theme to this 2016 NFL mock draft; much like there is to every mock draft. Decker is a dynamite player, great talker and a stand-up guy off the field we’re told. He also gave the most realistic and truthful soundbite you’ll ever hear from a college football player in response to a NFL mock draft. \n“I think a big thing they look for is do you improve as a player year to year,” said Decker at Big Ten Media Day. \n“I had a decent projection coming out of this year, but I want to improve upon it. If they sense complacency, it won’t improve my stock at all.” \n9. Houston, Christian Hackenberg , QB, Penn State \nCouldn’t help but mock the QB to his former college coach. \nIn just two years at Penn State, so much has been said about starting Quarterback Christian Hackenberg. Following his Big Ten freshman of the year campaign he was hyped up as the greatest thing since sliced bread. He’s also been hit with the “overrated” label . \nFor more on Christian Hackenberg go to this link \n10. Miami, Shilique Calhoun , DE/OLB, Michigan State \nCalhoun was one of only two defensive players in college football in 2013 to score three touchdowns. He’s a long athletic pass rusher, who surprised us all when he opted to go back, because he could have been in the first round mix. Like Leonard Williams, he can play either DE or DT so expect his stock to soar like Apple Corporation during the evaluative process. \nGo here for more on Calhoun \n\n11. Washington , Connor Cook , QB Michigan State \nCook made the right call by returning to school. The Cotton Bowl performance showed us everything we need to know about the pro potential of Connor Cook. He has tremendous ability, but he’s certainly not there yet. You saw some throws that needed to be delivered accurately that weren’t. With his size, arm and his ability to beat you from the pocket he’ll be a franchise level QB eventually. \nCook is a guy who’s truly developed and progressed through his time in East Lansing. At first, he was a game-manager relying on his defense. Now he’s the focal point of not just the offense, but the entire team. \n12. NY Giants, Tyler Boyd, WR, Pittsburgh \nThe breakout prospect who’s come out of nowhere once the season kicked off. \n13. Cleveland, Vadal Alexander , OL, LSU \nAlexander started out his career at right tackle in 2012. LSU made a really smart decision by moving him inside to guard for 2013 and the sophomore made huge progress in his game. He had a solid 2014, but he should to return to Baton Rouge. \nCould have left this year, if he really wanted to, but he’s making the right decision by staying in school. \nFor more on Vadal Alexander go her e \n14. St. Louis, Nick Martin , G, Notre Dame \nZack Martin set the NFL world on fire his rookie season, becoming the first ever rookie Right Guard to be named the league’s All-Pro. Obviously, the 2015 first round pick is a Pro Bowler too. His little brother Nick will start at Guard for the Irish again this fall. He also has NFL potential. Both Martin brothers passed up the NFL in order to stay in South Bend all four years. \nGo here for more on Nick Martin \n15. San Diego, Darron Lee , LB, Ohio State \nOhio State players everywhere in this NFL mock draft. Another late riser, the redshirt sophomore is a potential early entry candidate now. \nGo here for more on Elliott \n16. Oakland, Leonard Floyd, DE/OLB, Georgia \nSEC players everywhere in this NFL mock draft. Imagine pairing this guy with Khalil Mack; what a force that could be! \n17. NY Jets, Jaylon Smith , OLB, Notre Dame \nOn the eve of Notre Dame’s (or as LSU/SEC folk call them “Notra Dame”) big upset victory over #22 LSU, Fighting Irish Coach Brian Kelly extolled the virtues of OLB Jaylon Smith: \n“Certainly, physically, one of the better players that I have coached in my career. His best football is in front of him. We took him this year and moved him inside. Which is a big step for a guy that’s played outside, it’s a big difference so this year’s been a learning experience for him.” \nVery high praise for Smith, who heads into the 2015 season as the most talented, and perhaps best overall player on the Fighting Irish. There were only three defensive players (DL Isaac Rochell, LB Jaylon Smith and CB Cole Luke) who started all 13 games for the Irish this year. \n18. Seattle, J ack Conklin , OT, Michigan State \nTruly an elite player at a very high value position in a class that’s very much loaded. \nGo here for more on Conklin \n19. Indianapolis, Tre’Davious White, CB, LSU \nTo get past Tom Brady and the rest of the pass happy AFC, it’s a good idea to load up DBs in Indy. \n20. Philadelphia, Cody Kessler, QB, USC \nKessler looks the part of a USC QB, at 6-1, 215 but these days, NFL GMs like their signal callers somewhat taller than this. No one can doubt Kessler’s on-the-field production. Last week versus Washington was a total aberration. That game was the exception, not the rule. \nOn the season, Kessler is averaging 69.5% completion, to go along with 15 TDs and 3 INTs. \nClick on this link for more on Kessler \n21. Cleveland, Anthony Zettel , DE/DT, Penn State \nIt’s early but Zettel is rated among the top two or three Defensive Tackles on NFL Draft board. Right now he’s a sure fire NFL Draft first-rounder; as long as he stays healthy and produces. NFL scouts love his work ethic and discipline, and regard him to be an over-achiever, but also can over-achiever with tremendous talent. \n22. Buffalo, Wayne Lyons , CB, Michigan \nLyons comes in as a Stanford graduate transfer; and he’s rated the top cornerback prospect in the next NFL Draft by some services. \nGo here for more on Lyons \n23. Minnesota, Myles Jack, LB/RB, UCLA \nAs the Bruins fortunes continue to rise so does the stock of Jack. \n24. Atlanta, Scooby Wright III , OLB, Arizona \nSaid Fox Sports Joel Klatt: “He is the best defensive player in America. He leads the defense in the 3-3-5 scheme that adjusts well to the spread and they tackle well in space,” If Zona gets a lot of “Scooby snacks,” by that I mean big time Scooby Wright plays: sacks, forced fumbles, scoop-and-scores, tackle-for-losses, interceptions etc. Wright will see his draft stock take off. \n25. Dallas, Ezekiell Elliott , RB, Ohio State \nStock blew up like nitro in the post-season. Look for his stock to continue rising this season. \nGo here for more on Elliott \n26. Pittsburgh, Spencer Drango, OT, Baylor \nHe was key as to why Baylor’s offense was such a well-oiled machine the past few years. His skill set translates to the next level too \n27. Carolina, A’Shawn Robinson, DT, Alabama \nMore of a best player available than needs based. \n28. Cincinnati, Maliek Collins, DT, Nebraska \nOvershadowed by Randy Gregory last season, Collins has the ability but also minus the baggage. \n29. Arizona, Adolphus Washington , DT, Ohio State \nHe admitted at Media Day that he wasn’t ready for the NFL last year, because he really wasn’t aware that he had much NFL Draft stock then. \nGo here for more on Washington \n30. Denver, Cardale Jones , QB, Ohio State \nThe perfect time and space to draft Peyton Manning’s successor in a QB class that makes up for depth what it lacks in top tier blue chip prospects. The question is, does Cardale even want to come out this year? \nGo here for more on Jones \n31. Green Bay, KeiVarae Russell , CB, Notre Dame \nYes, KeiVarae Russell could end up being a great redemption story by the time the combine rolls around. From suspended/possibly never playing football again to the NFL mock draft (he’s listed in the first and second round in numerous mock drafts), Russell is a great comeback story. He’s also a great talker. Russell is a very interesting, loquacious guy who will perform well at the interview portion in Indianapolis come February. \nGo here for more on Russell. \n32. New England, Travin Dural , WR, LSU \nTradition dictates we always start our mock draft order with the Patriots in the last spot. Even with poor quarterback play, Dural was one of the breakout performers in the SEC this past season. He’s averaged 21 yards per catch with 35 receptions for 747 yards and seven touchdowns. The 6-foot-2, 192-pounder plays big with the quickness to make plays downfield. Given that he’s from the same school as Odell Beckham Jr., he may draw comparisons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:58:09.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
