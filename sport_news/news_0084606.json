Both men deny suggestions of an improper payment by the FIFA head to Platini in 2011.\nThe spokesman said executive committee members would consult with acting president Issa Hayatou as part of standard procedure before deciding whether to hold the meeting.\nIt was not immediately clear what might be the agenda of such a meeting.\nGerman Football Federation president Wolfgang Niersbach called for an extraordinary meeting after the bans on Thursday and was swiftly backed by Asian soccer chief Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa.\nBoth are members of the executive committee, whose next scheduled meeting is in Zurich in December.\nAccording to the FIFA statutes, the president must convene a meeting if it is requested by at least 13 members.\n(Reporting by Brian Homewood ; editing by Ralph Boulton )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:55:11.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
