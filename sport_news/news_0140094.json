(AP) — Rutgers coach Kyle Flood has returned to his coaching duties and apologized for contacting a faculty member about a player’s grade. \nFlood spoke to reporters Monday for the first time since serving a three game suspension. He says he should have known the rules, and doesn’t have concerns about his job security going forward. \nRutgers had suspended Flood and fined him $50,000. While he could coach during the week, Flood could not coach on game days and was not allowed to be in contact with the team on game days. He was also not allowed to speak to the media during his suspension. \nRutgers went 1-2 in Flood’s absence. The Scarlet Knights travel to Indiana on Saturday.
