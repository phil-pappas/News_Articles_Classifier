The visit coincides with the Head of the Charles Regatta, one of the world's premier rowing events. \nUSOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky says the stop was planned well before the USOC dropped Boston as the U.S. bid city for the 2024 Olympic Games, and isn't meant as a fence-mending attempt. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:54:45.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
