He made only nine starts for Class Double-A Mobile, going 1-6 with a 4.69 ERA. At age 22, he's still ranked as the Diamondbacks' No. 5 prospect by mlb.com. \nOutfielder Daniel Palka, who hit 29 home runs this season for Class-A Visalia, went 1 for 4, and catcher Oscar Hernandez , who was on the major-league roster for most of the season, was 0 for 3 for Salt River.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:46:11.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
