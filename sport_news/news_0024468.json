October 16th 2015 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Rugby Union/News/ \nTHIS is one way to seal a trade deal. \nOverzealous London mayor Boris Johnson has made international headlines for a sensational barnstorming hit-up during a game of rugby. \nThe only problem is the 51-year-old public figure was playing against 10-year-old Japanese children in a friendly game of touch football. \nJohnson was celebrating the conclusion of a four-day trade visit to Japan by playing a game with students from Nihonbashi, Yaesu & Kyobashi Community Associations in Tokyo. \nWith the Brave Blossomâ€™s winning plenty of international admiration for their shock Rugby World Cup win over South Africa, rugby appears to be quite trendy in Japan right now. \nSo, with the game underway, Johnson stepped up to the plate and grabbed the football for the standard photo opportunity for media covering his visit.
