As the shot cleared the wall, Twins second baseman Brian Dozier put his hands over his head in shock and disappointment.\nBut the Twins weren't done and Ramirez, who had angered them with some post-home run theatrics on Wednesday night, made the crucial error that ignited their rally.\nCleveland's Trevor Bauer, making his first start since Sept. 13, allowed just one run and two hits -- two doubles in the fourth -- and got a no-decision. The quirky right-hander, who flew a drone above the field before the game, was demoted to the bullpen last month but made only one appearance in relief.\nThere were no issues between the teams, one night after Ramirez flipped his bat toward Minnesota's dugout after hitting a three-run homer.\nMinnesota manager Paul Molitor hinted before the game that there would be no immediate retaliation by saying, \"We're going to prioritize winning.\"\nAnd that's what the Twins did as Ramirez didn't even see an inside pitch while going 0 for 4.\nPlouffe's two-out, ground-rule RBI double in the fourth gave the Twins a 1-0 lead.\nTRAINER'S ROOM\nIndians: OF Michael Brantley plans to begin a two-week recovery program on his right shoulder with the hope he'll be able to avoid surgery. Brantley was shut down Wednesday for the remainder of the season with an injury sustained last week while trying to make a diving catch.\n\"Nobody ever wants to go under the knife,\" said Brantley, who received a cortisone shot. \"As it stands right now, we're heading in the right direction.\"\nUP NEXT\nTwins: RHP Ervin Santana opens a three-game series against Kansas City, which clinched the AL Central title earlier this week and is trying to secure home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Santana, who can't pitch in the postseason because of a drug suspension, has won five straight starts.\nIndians: RHP Josh Tomlin makes his final start this season in the series opener against the Boston Red Sox.
