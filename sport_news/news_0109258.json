The menu includes historical recipes like the Country Captain, an 18th Century curry with Indian influences still popular in South Carolina, and one of the city's best plates of fried chicken . It's slowly become one of my favorite brunch spots in Portland.\nMuscadine is a worthy pick, and the issue is a fitting tribute to Ozersky.\nRelated: Muscadine offers a taste of the south in Northeast Portland\nFor years, Esquire's restaurant coverage felt like it had lost step with current food world trends. The magazine effectively ignored the recent Portland restaurant boom, naming just one local restaurant to its list in the past a decade . Ozersky took over Esquire's restaurant coverage last year, the same year he moved to Portland, and though Portland's drought continued in 2014 , he promised it would end soon.\nThe drought ends soon. All hail the PDX.
