While we’re still young, we at least have guys that played a lot in ACC games last year.” \nOne of the Wolfpack’s biggest areas of growth since losing to Louisville in 2014 is in its ability to finish games. This week, and every week from here on out, Doeren knows his team’s ability to play every minute of the game is going to be of the highest importance. \n“We’ve lost our ACC opener the last two seasons to Clemson and Florida State,” Doeren said. “I think last year they learned how to finish as the year went on. When you get into conference play, that’s what you’re going to have are four-quarter games.” \nIf NC State’s offensive consistency is indicative of its ability to finish a full game, the Pack will continue to be just fine. \nNC State boasts an offense with the nation’s most efficient quarterback – Jacoby Brisett has completed 77.9 percent of his passes this season – and one of the nation’s highest-scoring running backs -- Matt Dayes is tied for first with nine rushing touchdowns. \nFor an offense that has been both productive and efficient in every game this season, the main threat against the statistically strong NC State offense is the Cardinals secondary. \n“We’re excited to play a really, really good defense,” offensive coordinator Matt Canada said. (They have) one of the best defenses in the country and (are) s team that certainly got after us last year. \n“For this to be our first ACC game, our opener, I think we’re very excited,” Samuels said. “It’s a good defense, they have a lot of ball hawks in the secondary, they’re very physical and they’ve got a lot of speed.” \nLouisville’s offense has turned the ball over 10 times this season, but on the opposite side of the ball, the Cardinals defense is in a four-way first place tie for most interceptions in the nation with nine, posing a threatening stat against Brissett’s no interceptions season. The defensive line is a force, making week one of ACC play a true test for NC State, regardless of the dearth of wins on Louisville’s record. \n“Obviously we’re aware that we’re starting conference play, that’s real,” Canada said. “We know we’re playing a great team that has a great defense that has challenged and stopped the majority of the teams they’ve played. So, we’ve got a tremendous challenge.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:46:37.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
