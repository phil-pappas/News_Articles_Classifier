The Vikings won 16-10. By Bob Gretz ChiefsDigest.com \nMINNEAPOLIS — When the Kansas City Chiefs figure out how to be productive in all four quarters of a game, they might actually pickup another victory during the 2015 NFL season. \nThat did not happen Sunday afternoon when they were unable to make up enough ground from a horrid first-half performance on offense and fell 16-10 to the Minnesota Vikings at TCF Bank Stadium. \nThe Chiefs have now lost five consecutive games, standing 1-5 on the season. There are 10 games left on the schedule, and with the engine of their offense — running back Jamaal Charles — lost due to injury, it’s hard to believe they can make significant improvement. \n“Right now we are 1-5; that’s what we are,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “We’ve got to fix that.” \nOn this Sunday, the Chiefs trailed the Vikings 10-0 at halftime with the Vikings controlling the ball, clock and momentum in the first 30 minutes. \n“It was 51 yards of offense in the first half and 50 yards of penalties,” Reid said. “Completely unacceptable.” \nThe Chiefs’ 51 yards of offense came on 20 plays, and quarterback Alex Smith averaged less than four yards per pass attempt and was sacked twice. There were three offensive penalties; all wiped out plays for positive yardage. \n“We really just had so many self-inflicted things in the first half,” Smith said. “Self-inflicted in the penalties; you can’t even get going when you’re going backwards, especially against a team like that on the road. You’re just making it impossible.” \nDespite that horrid first half, the Chiefs were still in the game due to their defense. They stifled running back Adrian Peterson, who had 16 yards on 17 first-half carries. Peterson finished with 60 yards on 26 carries, or 2.3 yards per carry. \n“I think we did a good job, but we have to finish better and keep the emphasis on stopping the run from now on,” said defensive lineman Allen Bailey, who had eight tackles and a sack. \nMinnesota picked up field goals of 24 and 45 yards from kicker Blair Walsh that were wrapped around a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to tight end Kyle Rudolph in the second quarter. \nAfter Walsh’s field goal in the third quarter, the Chiefs drove the ball to the Minnesota 16-yard line where they had a first down. They picked up nine yards on two plays and faced third-and-1 at the Vikings 7-yard line. Fullback Anthony Sherman was stopped for no gain, as was running back Charcandrick West on fourth down. \nThe Chiefs were upset by the officials’ ruling on West’s run because it did not appear his knee or any part of his body touched the ground as he was being tackled. He rolled over the back of the defender and continued running into the end zone. The officials, however, had blown the play dead. \n“His knee did not touch the ground,” Reid said, “That was the bottom line.” \nMinnesota led 13-0 at the start of the fourth quarter, but the Chiefs offense was moving and drove into the Vikings’ half of the field, settling for a 48-yard field goal from Cairo Santos. \nCornerback Marcus Peters grabbed his third interception of his rookie season on the next possession and Smith directed the Chiefs 77 yards on seven plays to their only TD of the game, a 42-yard catch-and-run from wide receiver Albert Wilson that brought the Chiefs within three. \nEven after Walsh added a 45-yard field goal with less than 5:00 to play, the 16-10 score was still a one-touchdown game for the Chiefs. But, they lost the next possession when West fumbled the ball away — it was actually inadvertently knocked out of his grasp by teammate Donald Stephenson. \n“It doesn’t matter who hits the ball or how it happens. I just have to hold on to the ball,” said West, who had 10 touches in the game for 39 yards. “Fumbles are not acceptable.” \nKansas City 0 0 0 10 — 10 \nMinnesota 3 7 3 3 — 16 \nFIRST QUARTER \nMin — FG Walsh 24, 5:40. \nSECOND QUARTER \nMin — Rudolph 4 pass from Bridgewater (Walsh kick), 4:43. \nTHIRD QUARTER \nMin — FG Walsh 45, 8:51. \nFOURTH QUARTER \nKC — FG Santos 48, 13:10. \nKC — A.Wilson 42 pass from A.Smith (Santos kick), 8:46. \nMin — FG Walsh 45, 4:46. \nA — 52,480.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:51:48.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
