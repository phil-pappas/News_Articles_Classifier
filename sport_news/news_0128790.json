Pinch-runner Carlos Gomez was initially ruled safe when he made a dive back into first base, but the call was overturned upon review. Davis got Jose Altuve to ground out to end it. \nGame 3 is Sunday at Houston. Astros ace Dallas Keuchel, who was 15-0 at home this season, starts against Edinson Volquez. \nPhotos: Royals rally to beat Astros, 5-4, in Game 2 of ALDS Oct 9, 2015; Kansas City, MO, USA; Houston Astros right fielder George Springer (4) reacts after scoring a run against the Kansas City Royals in the first inning in game two of the ALDS at Kauffman Stadium.
