Greg Sankey on Line 1. Steve Shaw on Line 2. \nIf the Arkansas coach hasn't already received a call from the SEC's commissioner and its supervisor of football officials, he should probably stay by the phone. \nBielema has some explaining to do. \nA video of Bielema's bizarre behavior on a key second-quarter play during Alabama's 27-14 win over Arkansas has gone viral . The Hogs returned a Jake Coker interception to the Alabama 24-yard line, then Alabama tackle Cam Robinson was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct. \nThat penalty moved the ball to the 12. Three plays later, Arkansas scored a touchdown and took a 7-3 lead. \nWhat we didn't know then is exactly what Robinson did to earn that flag. The viral video shows Bielema may deserve the credit/blame for an Oscar-worthy performance. \nAs Robinson and Arkansas defensive lineman Hjalte Froholdt tumble toward the sideline at the end of the return, Bielema rushes out between two officials to get in Robinson's face, then appears to fake-stumble backward as if Robinson shoved him. \nAn official throws a flag, and Bielema does a goofy little dance to celebrate. @ClayTravisBGID watch Beilema instegate Cam Robinson, fake like he was shoved, then dance a jig to celebrate. pic.twitter.com/DYSSZdEkOM â€” Anthony Jacks (@Coach_Jacks) October 12, 2015 \nYou know when it's a good time to confront an opposing player during the game? Never. \nRELATED: Alabama climbs from a hole of its own digging to avoid burying the season \nWe already knew Saturday night in Bryant-Denny Stadium wasn't Bielema's finest hour. He made not one but two questionable fourth-down decisions in the third quarter with a chance to upset Alabama, and both of them backfired. \nHe failed to go for it on fourth-and-1 at the Alabama 46 midway through the third quarter with Arkansas leading 7-3 even though the Hogs weren't exactly marching up and down the field. \nThen he called a fake punt on fourth-and-5 near midfield with his team trailing 10-7. The punter's carry came up short, and Alabama drove the short field for the decisive touchdown. \nPerhaps there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for Bielema's behavior on the video in the Robinson incident. No doubt he'll be given every opportunity to provide it to the SEC office. \nBut unless there's something we can't see on video, Bielema's actions may be worthy of a one-game suspension. \nThat's my take.
