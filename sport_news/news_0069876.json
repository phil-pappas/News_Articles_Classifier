For years, Price called for the tournament to be shortened to make it a closer battle. This year, the total number of matches was reduced to 30 from 34 .\n“This is what the Presidents Cup needed. There’s no doubt,” he said after the defeat.\nEach session, from Friday afternoon through to the end of the tournament, finished with only one point separating the teams.\nAt one stage on Sunday afternoon it looked as though the International team was on a winning surge, as Indian Anirban Lahiri lined up a 4-foot putt on the final green, at a point when other matches were swinging against the U.S. However, Lahiri’s putt lipped out, surrendering a point and the momentum back to the U.S.\nENLARGE The International team’s Bae Sang-moon reacts after a bad pitch shot on the 18h hole in his Presidents Cup match against Bill Haas of the U.S. on Sunday.

But after winning 2.5 points for the team, he said he was eager for another opportunity to play in the tournament.\n“It’s OK, it’s OK,” the crowd chanted to him as he finished the final hole.\nU.S. veteran Phil Mickelson justified his selection as a captain’s pick with three wins and a draw, making him joint top scorer for the team with 2015 British Open winner Zach Johnson. South African Branden Grace led the International team with a perfect record of five wins—only the fifth player in competition history to achieve the feat.\nAn anticipated matchup between the world’s top two ranked players—Jordan Spieth of the U.S. and Jason Day of Australia—didn’t happen, and both players lost their singles matches to other opponents.\nThe next edition of the tournament will be held at Liberty National, in New Jersey, starting in Sept. 2017. The Ryder Cup—the better known golf face-off between the U.S. and Team Europe—is scheduled to start in late Sept. next year, at the Hazeltine course in Minnesota.\nWhile the Presidents Cup is likely to remain the less anticipated of the two competitions, players and coaches from both sides agreed this year’s tight battle has breathed new life into the tournament.\n“They (they players) have got some fire to go on because it got so close,” said Price.\nWrite to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS072_1011pr_M_20151011031442.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS072_1011pr_P_20151011031442.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:14:35.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
