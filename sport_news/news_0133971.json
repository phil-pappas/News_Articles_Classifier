(AP/Ed Zurga) \nWith all due respect to Dez Bryant, we saw our biggest fantasy injury of the season last week. \nWhen Jamaal Charles’ knee buckled, fantasy owners could see their seasons going down the drain. \nThe Chiefs back — likely your first-round pick or keeper — is out for the season with a torn ACL, leaving the K.C. and you in the lurch. \nWhile Knile Davis has been the handcuff for a couple of years now, it seems that the back to own from K.C. is Charcandrick West. \nReports are that coach Andy Reid favours the undrafted rookie and the numbers show it, too. West had seven carries in the game and Davis had just two. West is also the better receiving threat, which is a big deal when you remember how much Reid and Alex Smith love screens and check-downs. \nBoth backs should be owned in all leagues until we see how this situation shakes out, but West looks the better bet for carries early on. Keep your eye on Davis, though, as he could inherit goal-line duties. \nBIG SHAKEUP IN BIG D \nAs for Bryant, he is back doing conditioning drills at practice this week while the Cowboys are on their bye week. Considering his injury and the surgery involved, it will be smart for both him and the team to be conservative when it comes to a return. \nHis foot injury is the type that can easily cause problems in the future if you don’t allow it to fully heal, meaning you shouldn’t count on Bryant back for Week 7. \nThe two fantasy-related changes that will happen in Week 7 are at QB and RB. \nMatt Cassel will take over for check-down king Brandon Weeden, but we don’t see that making much of a difference. He should remain on the waiver wire, unless you’re in a deep league and need a bye week fill-in. \nDallas is also taking the week off to get Christine Michael more involved in the backfield. This is bad news for Joseph Randle owners, as he stands to lose some touches with this change. Darren McFadden figures to keep his role on passing downs, filling the void left by Lance Dunbar’s injury two weeks ago. \nMichael should be picked up in all leagues and could be a potential game-changer down the stretch. \nBUFFALO’D \nAnother team with a lot of moving pieces right now is the Buffalo Bills. \nStarting QB Tyrod Taylor suffered a sprained MCL last week, though he didn’t miss any snaps. This week the injury should keep him out — though coach Rex Ryan says he’s a game-time decision — with former first-round pick E.J. Manuel getting his first start in more than a year. \nConsidering what we have seen from Manuel in the past, we’re not expecting much from him and this move lowers the ceiling on his receivers as well. \nThe biggest news about the Bills pass-catchers this week was the fact that Sammy Watkins is very unhappy with the amount of targets he’s seeing — which is really funny because he has been injured for the past two weeks. We’ll see how this demand works out if he suits up this week. \nLeSean McCoy seems to have proclaimed himself ready to play after posting a hint on Instagram yesterday and is listed as probable, though not yet 100% after a hamstring injury. Needless to say, we have concerns about how effective he’ll be against a tough Bengals front. Dan Herron and, to a lesser extent, Boobie Dixon, will still see carries. Karlos Williams remains in the league’s concussion protocol and is all but ruled out. \nGATES SWINGING \nThose who waited for Antonio Gates to return from suspension were greatly rewarded last week and it’s looking good going forward for the future hall of famer. \nHe led the team in targets, receptions and yards in his return, which should trouble Keenan Allen owners. The wide receiver was top dog in Gates’ absence, even filling his role in most sets. \nWe wouldn’t expect any more 18-target games for Allen going forward, but should be on the WR2 radar. \nTHINKING AHEAD \nWith some big fantasy teams on the bye next week, you might want to see where you might need a spot-start. With the Packers, Broncos, Bears and Bengals off, that will leave some big holes. \nOne player who’s not even active this week that you should consider grabbing is Brandon LaFell. The Patriots receiver will return from the PUP list and reports indicate that he’s ready to go immediately. \nLaFell equalled teammate Julian Edelman in points last season and will be an instant starter in one of the league’s best offences. \nSIT/START \nStart Blake Bortles, QB, JAC vs. HOU \nComing off his best game ever and faces a ripe Texans pass defence. \nStart Andy Dalton, QB, CIN at BUF \nFor all the hype that the Bills defence is getting, fantasy QBs have lit them up this season. \nSit Melvin Gordon, RB, SD at GB \nHas had a slow start to the season and Danny Woodhead is looking like a more solid play. \nStart LeGarrette Blount, RB, NE at IND \nRemember Jonas Gray? His massive game last season came against the Colts. \nSit Alfred Morris, RB, WAS at NYJ \nLosing more touches every week to Matt Jones, who should play through toe injury. \nSit Andre Johnson, WR, IND vs. NE \nBig game looks like more of a revenge plan against Texans than sustainable forecast. \nStart Allen Hurns, WR, JAC vs. HOU \nHas scored three weeks in a row and has two 100-yards games in a row. \nSit Percy Harvin, WR, BUF vs. CIN \nWatkins’ potential return and Taylor’s injury should greatly diminish Harvin’s value. \nStart Julius Thomas, TE, JAC vs. HOU \nMakes his second start after a hand injury in camp against a very average pass defence. \nSTAT CORNER \nThe top six receivers in career yards per game are currently active, led by Julio Jones at 90.3. That’s 14.7 yards per game more than Jerry Rice. \nADD OF THE WEEK \nWillie Snead, WR, NO \nHe didn’t have an excellent game on Thursday, but Willie Snead remains the top receiver on the Saints. After all the pre-season hype for Brandin Cooks, Snead has clearly passed him on the depth chart. \nDROP OF THE WEEK \nOwen Daniels, TE, DEN \nWe’re not entirely shocked to see Daniels appear on this list. We’re guessing most who picked up the Broncos TE were looking for a replacement with Gronk on the bye. Daniels came up small in Oakland, failing to notch a reception on five targets. \nWAIVER DEFENCE \nTennessee Titans DEF \nThe Titans defence is solid, but not spectacular, which could serve you well this week. Tennessee hosts a Dolphins team that just promoted its TE coach to the top job. Whether the team responds remains to be seen, but we do know Ryan Tannehill has thrown five picks in the past two games.
