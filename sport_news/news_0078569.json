The unassuming freshman surprised many, including herself but not her coach, by pulling away to victory. \n“I love how people reacted and appreciated everything,” said Cash, who finished in 22 minutes, 57.32 seconds. “At the end of the race, I love hugging people. \n“I don’t know why, but I think about other runners as I’m passing them and I feel sorry for them.” \nThey might have to get used to it. \nCash didn’t register a top-three finish during the regular-season, but she’s been running cross-country since the sixth-grade and peaked recently in practice. \n“I knew she could do it,” Honokaa coach Jeri Moniz said. “She executed a game plan.” \nThere was no surprise on the boys side. \nWaiakea’s Louie Ondo earned his second consecutive crown and led the Warriors to the team title. After the crossing the finish line, Ondo fought back tears, looked to the sky and shouted, “I love you grandpa.” \n“He passed away last week, and I was really close to him,” Ondo said. “He was like a second father. We had a special connection. \n“I remember he would always tell me that he couldn’t wait to watch me run. He was dedicated to me, so I dedicated this race to him.” \nThe boys race started with some drama thanks to a victory by Kealakehe’s Ziggy Bartholomy two weeks ago that relegated Ondo to a rare runner-up finish. \nDuring an overcast finals, Ondo finished in 16:34.69, which is more than 22 seconds off his personal-best at the course. Yet he was still 20 second ahead of the runner-up, Hawaii Prep’s Nate Ladwig. \n“I wasn’t running for myself, I was running for my team and my grandpa,” Ondo said. \nHilo’s River Brown, Konawaena’s Cody Ranfranz and Kealakehe’s Adalberto Malagon rounded out the top five, but Waiakea’s Rylie Cabalse (eighth), Slater Inouye (ninth), Adrian Larkspur (11th) and Eric Cabais-Fernandez all finished in the top 15 as the Vikings failed to win a race for the first time this season. \nWaiakea coach Jordan Rosado said the Warriors hadn’t won a team title since the 198os, but they got personal-bests from their Nos. 2-5 runners. \n“I’m speechless,” Rosado said. \nSo was Cash after excepting numerous congratulations and becoming Honokaa’s first female BIIF champ since Tia Greenwell in 2010. \n“I can’t believe it,” Cash said. \nCash came home strong, but a few runners collapsed at the finish, including Waiakea’s Saya Yabe (23.13.03), who was second. \n“This is the hardest course,” Cash said. “HPA has one hill, but this has a bunch of small hills. Uphill, downhill, uphill. Very tricky.” \nHilo’s Kaela Pacyao-Rivilla and Kamehameha’s Joey-Ann Cootey were third and fourth, respectively, and then came the Hawaii Prep contingent. \nEmi Higgins (fifth), Zoe McGinnis (sixth), Ada Benson (eighth), Savannah Cochran (10th) and Tove Fostvedt (11th) helped Ka Makani maintain their girls dynasty. \nOn Halloween on Maui at the HHSAA championships, Ondo will try to improve on his third-place finish at states a year ago, and this time he’ll be accompanied by his teammates. \n“People say running isn’t a team sport, but I think it is,” he said. “It takes seven to win.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:24:28.287+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
