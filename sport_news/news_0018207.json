Lee McDonnell (24), who has 111 previous convictions, remained at large for five weeks until he was caught by gardai following a chase on foot in Clondalkin, Dublin.\npictured Robert Ellis and Lee McDonnell He is serving a nine-year sentence for an aggravated burglary in which he broke into a house, beat a man with the butt of a replica gun and took his car.\nLater that day, he robbed a petrol station using the stolen car and also beat the shopkeeper with the replica gun. He is not due for release until September, 2021, after the Court of Appeal extended his sentence by two years earlier this year.\nDublin Circuit Criminal Court heard that, although McDonnell - with a previous address of Lough Conn Road, Ballyfermot, Dublin - faced internal disciplinary proceedings in Portlaoise Prison after his capture, his standard 25pc remission for good behaviour will not be affected. Instead, he was deprived of leisure activities, visits and the right to wear his own clothes for 56 days.\nSentencing McDonnell yesterday, Judge Martin Nolan said he had to deter him and others from future escape attempts.\nPerfect\nJudge Nolan imposed a ten-month sentence, pushing McDonnell's release date to 2022. The judge commented that \"there's no such thing as perfect security and Mr McDonnell took advantage of that\", adding: \"I don't think there's any criticism of the prison staff who were simply buying food.\"\nMcDonnell pleaded guilty to escaping from lawful custody and to possessing a Stanley blade on his capture.\nDetective Garda Michael O'Brien told John Byrne BL, prosecuting, that McDonnell was taken to the Mater Hospital for treatment for an arm injury in rigid handcuffs.\nAfter treatment medical staff requested that the rigid cuffs be left off him because of the injury. He was put in the back of the van, handcuffed to an officer.\nWhen another officer went into a chipper to get him food McDonnell pretended to be sick and asked that the van window be opened. He slipped out of his handcuff, leaned out the window and opened the door before escaping up Emmet Road.\nThe following month two gardai on foot patrol in Clondalkin spotted him. They chased him through several back gardens and on to a flat kitchen roof, before tackling him to the ground and arresting him.", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31616898.ece/a2964/ALTERNATES/w620/page4_mcdonnell.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:11:20.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
