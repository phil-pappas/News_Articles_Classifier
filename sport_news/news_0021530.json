He has seven in the league, only one less than Neymar. \n\"We know the importance of Luis,\" Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said. \"What he gives you is invaluable.\" \nBarcelona, still without the injured Lionel Messi, had lost two of its last four league games. It also had to rally from a goal down in its previous home match, a 5-2 win over Rayo Vallecano last week. \nEibar was unbeaten in four matches entering the matchup against the defending champions. \nIt dropped to seventh place in the 20-team standings following the loss. \nMascherano was sent off in the 83rd after complaining to the officials and could face a long suspension if found guilty of insulting the linesman. \nEarlier Sunday, fifth-place Villarreal missed a chance to stay near the leaders after a 0-0 draw at newcomer Las Palmas, while Real Sociedad defeated host Levante 4-0 with a pair of goals by forward Carlos Vela. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:17:30.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
