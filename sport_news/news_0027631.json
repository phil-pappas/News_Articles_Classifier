The Knightsâ€™ last win came against Scranton Prep. They are scheduled to play at North Pocono on Friday. \nDunmore is anchored in at No. 3 with 73 points. The Bucks won their fifth straight game since an opening night loss to Scranton Prep. \nThis week, the Bucks will host Lakeland, which moved up two spots to No. 8 after a 53-13 win over Montrose. \nDunmore and Lakeland have a storied rivalry. The Bucks have won 23 of the 43 meetings and the teams have combined for 12 District 2 championships in their history. \nDelaware Valley has gotten its season straightened out after starting 0-2. The Warriors, who are \nNo. 4, have won four straight and will host No. 5 Valley View on Saturday at 4 p.m. as part of Warrior Day. \nValley View captured the second annual RailRiders Bowl with a 14-13 win over Abington Heights, which stayed at No. 7 in the poll and will play at Scranton Prep on \nSaturday. \nOld Forge recorded its 21st straight win in the LFC Division III and its second straight shutout of the season with a win over Mid Valley. The Blue Devils will be home against Lackawanna Trail on Friday. \nWallenpaupack stayed in the poll, dropping one spot to No. 9, while West Scranton fell one spot after not playing Scranton because of the teachers strike. \nThose two teams are scheduled to play this weekend. \nNorth Pocono and Riverside also received consideration. \nContact the writer: \n@JobyFawcett26 on Twitter We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.
