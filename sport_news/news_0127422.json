They didn't win a single game in the National League Championship Series.\nYou'd think Cubs fans would be used to that by now. But this was the year they got used to winning.\nThe Cubs won 97 times in the regular season, then ousted two teams with better records in the postseason before falling to the Mets 8-3 in Game 4 on Wednesday night.\nThey clinched the division series at home, the first time that's happened in the 101-year history of Wrigley Field.\nLet's take stock of all that before we start with the wait-till-next-year business.\nLet's celebrate this year.\nIt was awesome. It was unexpected. It was thrilling.\nIt was a gift to the city of Chicago from a team of overachievers, including four standout rookie starters.\nLadies and gentlemen, we give you Cubs all-time postseason home run leader Kyle Schwarber, age 22. Rookie of the year candidate Kris Bryant, 23. Cardinal-killer Jorge Soler, 23. And who knows how this series might have ended if clutch-hitter Addison Russell hadn't been forced to sit out with a pulled hamstring? He's 21.\nJoe Maddon and his Cubs coaching staff are in harmony Mark Gonzales Most of manager Joe Maddon's coaching staff already was under contract before his arrival, and Maddon stopped his traditional bi-monthly meetings with his staff during the latter stages of the regular season.\nBut Maddon said he couldn't be more delighted with his communication with the coaching...\nMost of manager Joe Maddon's coaching staff already was under contract before his arrival, and Maddon stopped his traditional bi-monthly meetings with his staff during the latter stages of the regular season.\nBut Maddon said he couldn't be more delighted with his communication with the coaching...\n(Mark Gonzales) The Cubs are a homegrown team, young and hungry. Not a crew of grizzled veterans making their last stand. Not a collection of expensive talent purchased at the trade deadline to be offloaded in a fire sale the day after tomorrow. They'll be back. They'll have plenty of next years.\nBut this year was something special. Let's not forget it. There's so much to savor in the months before pitchers and catchers report to the desert.\nJake Arrieta's no-hitter against the Dodgers. Heck, Arrieta's whole second half, with that impossible 0.75 ERA that ought to win him a Cy Young Award. Four four-game sweeps. That Schwarber home run ball that landed atop the right field video board in that Game 4 win over the Cardinals in the division series. Six home runs by six different Cubs — a major league record — in Game 3 of the same series.\nWhile we all were watching this postseason unfold, Chicago's other sports franchises were doing their October thing.\nFor the Bears, that thing is digging a hole early and spending the rest of the season trying to claw back out.\nCubs fans around the globe scramble to keep up with team's playoff run Rachel Crosby Ben Harburg lives in Singapore, but he was in Wrigleyville on Wednesday night for Game 4 of the Cubs-Mets face-off in the National League Championship Series. He would've been there for Game 3, too, but he was in the air, making a 22-hour trip to Chicago.\nIncluding the wild-card game against the...\nBen Harburg lives in Singapore, but he was in Wrigleyville on Wednesday night for Game 4 of the Cubs-Mets face-off in the National League Championship Series.

Basketball. Hockey.\nWe live in a town that has all of that, every October.\nThis year, we had baseball too.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets Kyle Schwarber Stanley Cup Playoffs Cy Young Award St. Louis Cardinals", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56285e6c/turbine/ct-cubs-lose-nlcs-mets-edit-20151021", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56282ddd/turbine/ct-cubs-expat-fans-met-20151021", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56283875/turbine/ct-maddon-coaching-staff-bits-cubs-spt-1022-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:20:55.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
