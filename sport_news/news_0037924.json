Sepp Blatter, facing a criminal investigation as part of football's corruption scandal, will \"definitely not\" stay on as president of t he FIFA governing body after t he election of a new leader in February, his daughter said. \nHis former public relations adviser Klaus Stoehlker said last week that Blatter had not ruled out trying to stay on as he ad of world football beyond t he Feb. 26 vote. \nBut Corinne Blatter-Andenmatten said in an interview publis he d by Swiss news paper Blick am Sonntag on Sunday t he re was \"no way\" he would continue, and at some point he would publish his memoirs. \n\"I know he wants to quit , and he will do it,\" s he said. \nMajor football sponsors on Friday issued coordinated calls for t he immediate resignation of Blatter, who is being investigated by t he Swiss on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds. \nBlatter, who denies wrongdoing, said through his US lawyer he would not resign as it was not in FIFA 's best interest. \nT he scandals surrounding global football exploded in May, w he n 14 officials and sports marketing executives were indicted on US charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud in relation to bribery sc he mes that dated back decades. \nFebruary's election was set after Blatter announced in June that he was standing down, just days after winning a fifth term. \nSince t he n, t he question of w he t he r Blatter, 79, really will quit has hung over FIFA . \nBlatter-Andenmatten, who has frequently spoken out to defend he r fat he r's reputation, said he had stayed on because t he majority of football associations wanted him to, and because \" he never runs away w he n t he going gets tough.\" \nS he declined to discuss t he possibility of he r fat he r ending up in jail: \"I don't even want to think about it. It's inconceivable to me that he would have to go to prison.\" \nBlatter was questioned by Swiss federal prosecutors for eight hours on Sept 25, and looked \"shocked and disappointed\" to be taken by surprise by t he ir arrival, his daughter said. \n\" He just said to me: 'I think it's a dream,'\" Blatter-Andenmatten said. \nS he blamed t he media for ruining he r fat he r's reputation and said Swiss prosecutors appeared to have prejudged him. \nT he prosecutors said Blatter was suspected of a \"disloyal payment\" of 2 million Swiss francs ($2.05 million) in 2011 to Mic he l Platini, president of t he UEFA football confederation, at t he expense of FIFA . \nPlatini has not been accused of any wrongdoing, although he has acknowledged t he development has damaged his chances of replacing Blatter as FIFA president. \nBlatter-Andenmatten suggested t he job of FIFA president could be shared by more than one person after Blatter leaves. \nSwiss watch firm and FIFA sponsor Hublot did not join t he calls for Blatter to step down. \n\"We do not believe that it is our role to interfere in t he politics of FIFA ,\" Switzerland's Schweiz am Sonntag news paper quoted chairman Jean-Claude Biver as saying. \nT he same paper quoted Peter Gilli√©ron, president of t he Swiss Football Association, as saying he saw no alternative to Blatter until t he election. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:39:09.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
