So as you don't get confused a Demerara Shrub is nothing more than a simple sugar syrup that is made with fruits, sugar and sometimes vinegar. Once you start making the demerara you'll run across oleo sacrum another phrase that may confuse you. Oleo sacrum is nothing more than a combination of citrus and sugar that is more of a sugary oil that provides an added flavor and aroma to your punch.
