But we all know that sooner or later Old Man Winter will rear up and blast us with freezing temperatures and blowing winds. For most people, those thoughts are downright dreadful. One group of dedicated outdoors enthusiasts think otherwise-the mighty waterfowl hunter. Related Links Rogers: Allow yourself time to enjoy the fall season \nDepending on the zone in which you live, waterfowl season has already begun, or is about to. There are many duck hunters and goose callers that have been waiting for this page of the calendar to show itself. This die-hard lot goes above and beyond both in preparation and execution of their sport than most people realize. \nI have to say, I love to hunt waterfowl and have been lucky enough to hunt with some pretty amazing people all over the country. I’ve targeted ducks in the middle of the infamous Ballard County, Kentucky and most parts of the Arkansas flatlands. I’ve shot geese both over fields and in rivers. \nThat doesn’t mean I am a waterfowl expert. I’m just a guy that has hunted with some of the best and set up decoys in amazing locations. \nThe common factor I’ve noticed is that these dedicated individuals think nothing of waking hours before most other hunters, trudge hundreds of pounds of gear into the middle of a field or through the toughest of waterways, wait for the sun to rise, and anticipate the chance to call in a group of birds and watch them work to their decoys. Then they get up and do it all over again the next morning. The first time I went goose hunting I remember the guy I was hunting with tell me to meet him at a certain gas station at some horrific time of the morning. It was early enough I wondered why I even went to bed. \nWhen he pulled up, his truck pulled a sizable trailer. In it, dozens and dozens of full-bodied goose decoys waited to be dispersed. I’ll never forget when he opened the door to that thing. I thought there is no way he will want all of them. I was wrong. We carried those plastic recreations, four at a time, one trip after another, until I thought my arms would fall off. I have no idea how many we placed in the cut corn field, but when I finally turned around and took it all in I was impressed. An army of goose silhouettes made me twinge with excitement. Next came the layout blinds. We lugged them into the middle of the decoys. The next 15 minutes consisted of blending them into the surroundings. We stuffed corn stalks in and around the blinds to make sure birds soaring overhead wouldn’t pick us out. \nAfter I worked up a sizable sweat from the morning activity, we had to drive the truck and trailer to the other end of the field. No big deal until I turned around and walked back across half the county. \nI never in my life had done so much work on the morning of a hunt. I promised myself to never again complain about how much work it is to use a climbing deer stand. That was nothing compared to this. \nNo sooner had we returned to the blinds and settled in, did the sun start to peak over the horizon. In the distance, the telltale sound of geese honking cut the morning air. It was about the begin. This seasoned goose hunter I was with flagged down the birds, called them in with some well-timed calls and before I knew it I witnessed landing gear down and Canada Geese dropping onto our position. In that moment, that singular, beautiful moment, I knew that everything we had done was worth it. I now knew why the mornings started so early, why the decoys had to be setup just right, and how come the blinds needed to be covered. \nWaterfowlers experience an adrenaline rush that is hard to explain until you hear the whistle of the wings for yourself. Good luck this year and be safe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:46:51.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
