The chair was too far away and I almost fainted.\n\"Spike Lee says the mayor is a bully,\" Old School announced.\nNo!\nRahm? A bully? Impossible, said I from the carpet, as I stared up at the famed portrait of the mayor of Chicago as \"The Rahmfather,\" with the wry, sensitive expression of a Hollywood gangster on his face.\nA bully?\nThe same Rahm who cared so much about children in his six-part infomercial on CNN that was offered as \"news\"? The Rahm who wore soft sweaters during his campaign, and never swore in public, not even at those little kids who dared play on the grass when he was announcing the NFL draft coming to Chicago?\nThat Rahm? Preposterous!\nBut there it was in Chicago magazine's December issue, with Lee explaining in an interview how Rahm was angry about \"Chi-Raq,\" \"the movie about the slaughterhouse that is Chicago.\nWriter/director Spike Lee's latest film, \"Chi-raq,\" has sparked controversy since he announced the title and began filming in Chicago.\nRahm didn't like the title and neither did his minions among the aldermen, whom Lee called the mayor's \"bootlickers.\"\nThe mayor didn't like it because \"Chi-Raq\" suggests that Chicago is a violent place, like a war zone, like Iraq. Actually, Chicago is more violent than Iraq is now.\n\"OK, so that's where your mayor and I got off on the wrong foot, right away,\" Lee told Bryan Smith in an excellent interview. \"What I didn't like was him trying to paint me as this villain. I'm not the bad guy, but that's how he was trying to portray it. Do I have the guns? Am I the one pulling the trigger? To be honest, he's a bully.\"\nLee was asked how he handled the confrontation.\n\"You know I'm from Brooklyn, so … He's not gonna bully me. My tactic with the mayor — any bully — is to come out swinging. I said, 'Mayor, Your Honor, you're gonna be on the wrong side of history.'\"\nThousands of people have been shot down in Chicago already this year. That's right. Thousands. Most are shot on the West and South sides as part of gang wars and black-on-black crime, although all groups are represented in the body count. At the end of September, shootings were up about 20 percent over the same period last year.\nExclusive visit behind the scenes of Spike Lee's Chi-raq Nina Metz \"Chi-raq\" has been shrouded in mystery since news of the project first leaked in the spring, but a visit to director Spike Lee's film set this week revealed that much speculation about the movie — sparked largely by the title itself — has been off the mark.\nThis is the first feature-length film...\n\"Chi-raq\" has been shrouded in mystery since news of the project first leaked in the spring, but a visit to director Spike Lee's film set this week revealed that much speculation about the movie — sparked largely by the title itself — has been off the mark.\nThis is the first feature-length film...\n(Nina Metz) But national Democrats don't dare to show up in Chicago to condemn the constant bloodletting. Having them here would embarrass President Barack Obama and the mayor.\nAl Sharpton, who promised (or was that \"threatened?\") to live in Chicago, never quite got around to it, and I'm sure Rahm is eternally grateful.\nThe president hardly visits and if he comments on Chicago killings, it's usually in the abstract, or a reference to some perfect victim, not the scores of imperfect young men, mostly undereducated, desperate, without jobs or prospects, whose deaths are ignored or avoided by political activists because such deaths don't offer them much leverage.\nIn August 2014, while the hustlers were busy preening before the cameras in Ferguson, Mo., a 9-year-old named Antonio was gunned down by the gangs in an alley off 71st Street.\nThe Rev. Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Catholic Church, called it \"an execution\" and put out a reward. Pfleger also shamed political actors who were loudly demanding justice in Ferguson while avoiding the carnage in Chicago.\n\"We cannot simply be outraged about something that happens someplace else and get immune to what happens at home,\" Pfleger told me then. \"This is pure evil.\"\nThough the politicians avoid Chicago, Spike Lee did not. He connected with Pfleger, who helped him reach the community to tell the story. While Pfleger became an ally, City Hall made things difficult, Lee told Chicago magazine.\nLike Ald. David Moore, 17th, initially denying a permit for a community and crew block party, and Obama's Ald. Will Burns, 4th, who tried to pass a resolution to stop Lee from getting state tax credits for shooting the movie in Chicago.\n\"A lot of stuff he (Emanuel) might not have done directly, but I see his fingerprints,\" Lee told Chicago magazine.\nLee sounds like a guy who's studied the Chicago Way.\n\"Chi-Raq,\" as most film fans know by now, is loosely based not only on Chicago carnage, but on the work of ancient Greek author Aristophanes, who made a career of using theater to aggravate the political class.\nThe play Lee uses as his model is \"Lysistrata,\" a story of war-weary women who came up with a plan to win the peace.\nThe only quibble I have with the interview involves Lee's description of the play:\n\"Well, this play was written by the Greek playwright Aristophanes, 411 B.C. The lead character was tired of the war between the Trojans and the Spartans. So she came up with this amazing idea: We could make our men put down their spears, their knives, whatever, if we get all the women together and withhold sex, have a sex strike.\"\nAll good, except the Trojans had nothing to do with it. They had the horse problem ages before. \"Lysistrata\" is set during the devastating Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta.\nThe main thing is that Lee is right. Rahm is a bully, like many Chicago bosses before him, and many — but not all — aldermen lick the boots of the boss.\nAnd I can't wait to see \"Chi-Raq\" when it is finally released. I'm sure that Rahm wants to see it too.\njskass@tribpub.com\nTwitter @John_Kass\n Spike Lee Rahm Emanuel William D. Burns David H.
