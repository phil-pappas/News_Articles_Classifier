We have to find a way to be more consistent than what we played today,\" \nAs expected, quarterback Brandon Doughty had a huge day throwing for 359 yards and five touchdowns while surpassing 10,000 yards in his career. \nFrom the start, Doughty picked apart the Blue Raider secondary and put MTSU in a hole that the Blue Raiders could not dig themselves out of the rest of the game. \nOnly one of the Hilltoppers scoring drives at the half lasted more than four minutes and to add insult to injury, Western Kentucky recovered an onside kick at the half to put them up by 38. \nBy the end of the game, the Hilltoppers had put up 593 yards of total offense on MTSU. The last time a team put up 500 yards on the Blue Raider defense was Alabama on Sept. 12 this year. \n“We were sticking to the game plan, but we just tried to open up more and get our run-game going,\" MTSU receiver Richie James, who finished with 7 catches for 144 yards and two touchdowns, said. \"Give credit to them; their offensive is explosive and they made plays. \n\"It’s hard to catch up with an explosive offense.\" \nDespite knowing Doughty and the Hilltoppers would run trick plays, the MTSU secondary got burned one for a touchdown when wide receiver Nacarius Fant hit fellow receiver Taywan Taylor for a 69-yard touchdown. \n\"We knew we had to keep the ball in front of us,\" Stockstill said about the Hilltoppers' use of trick plays. \"They're an explosive team and have great dynamic, skill players.\" \nThe Blue Raiders showed life out of the gate in the second half when quarterback Brent Stockstill started finding his receivers downfield. \nStockstill’s most reliable receivers this season, Richie James and Ed Batties, finished the game with 183 yards combined and three touchdowns. \n“I told our team at halftime that I think we’re a good football team, and we proved that in the second half,\" Stockstill said. \"Our guys are going to compete and pay hard and finish every play, so I was proud of how we came out in the second half and got another score on the board at the end of the third quarter.\" \nBut Western Kentucky did too much damage early, and the Blue Raiders dropped their third game in a row and dropped to 1-1 in Conference USA. \n\"We'll stay positive, and I have no doubts whatsoever about this team,\" Stockstill said. \"We'll bounce back and get back to work tomorrow,\" \nMTSU will host Florida International at home next week and still has a chance to become bowl eligible on the year. \nBut with Saturday’s loss, the wiggle room got a whole lot smaller. \nReach Aldo Amato at 615-278-5109 and on Twitter @Aldo_ Amato", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:26:41.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
