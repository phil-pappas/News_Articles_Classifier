Here are some of the highlights:\nQuestion: Maybe it's just me, but it seems like the Big 12 is being left out of many experts' current CFB Playoff predictions. What does your final four look like right now?\nCarlton: Actually, I'm seeing a lot of love for Baylor right now, despite the Bears' non-conference schedule. My view: until at least one Big 12 team shows up in the College Football Playoff bracket in December, there's going to be a lot of trepidation about the lack of a title game and what happened last year. And if you're TCU or Oklahoma, you can't be thrilled with being idle on that final weekend without a chance to make a case.\nQuestion: How genuine of a threat to Baylor/TCU is Oklahoma now? And are the Sooners merely playing spoiler at this point?\nCarlton: That loss to Texas isn't great for a playoff resume.
