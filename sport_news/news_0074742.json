(Photo by NFL via Getty Images) Seahawks Notebook: MLB Bobby Wagner expects to play Thursday against 49ers 1 / 4 Back to Gallery \nThe Seahawks defense should get a major boost Thursday night against the 49ers when middle linebacker Bobby Wagner returns after missing this past Sunday's loss to the Panthers with a strained pectoral muscle. \nWagner, a first-team All-Pro last season, told reporters Tuesday at the Virginia Mason Athletic Center that he expects to play against San Francisco. He was a limited in Monday's practice but participated fully Tuesday. \nThe 25-year-old hurt his pectoral muscle in the first quarter of the Seahawks' Oct. 11 loss to Cincinnati. He initially thought it was a cramp, and after being looked at, decided to ignore the pain and finished the game. \nHis return means that K.J. Wright will return to his natural weakside linebacker spot after filling in one game for Wagner on the inside. That should bode well for the Seahawks when they face a 2-4 49ers outfit ranked 12th in the NFL in rushing, at 118.3 yards per game. \nThe middle linebacker in the Seahawks defense is responsible for verbalizing the playcall in the huddle -- a tricky job because of CenturyLink Field's noise level -- so Wright was asked Tuesday what happened on the miscommunication that allowed Panthers' quarterback Cam Newton to find tight end Greg Olson open for a 26-yard, game-winning touchdown pass in the game's final minute. \n\"I guess you can put that on the (inside) backer, but it's something that just happens,\" Wright said. \nAccording to Wright, the signal from the sidelines came in on time. They had a chance to huddle because Newton had spiked the ball on the previous play, yet the mix-up still occurred. \n\"It probably won't happen all season, where teams pick up on our miscommunication like that so it was a one-time deal,\" Wright said. \"It's just kind of the theme of our season this year.\" \nAsked what could prevent another miscommunication, defensive coordinator Kris Richard said \"get to the huddle,\" while hinting that it didn't seem like everyone understood Wright's playcall. \n\"What was supposed to happen, was a coverage that didn't happen,\" Richard said. \"And ultimately, we all saw the result of that.\" \nSherman not panicking \nCornerback Richard Sherman on Tuesday downplayed any notion that the Seahawks are worried about their inauspicious start following two consecutive Super Bowl appearances. \nA reporter asked how big of a hole Seattle has dug with a 2-4 record. Last season, the Seahawks began 3-3 before rallying to win nine of their last 10 and clinch homefield advantage in the NFC. \n\"The same size it always is,\" Sherman said. \"Not anything to be concerned about on our end. I think we're a hard team to rattle, a hard team to get down... you don't win all the games. And I think sometimes these moments kind of help you improve as a team, and we appreciate that, we appreciate how tough it is this year.\" \nThree of the Seahawks losses have come against the Green Bay Packers, Bengals and Panthers. Each of them are undefeated. \n\"We're in a lot of these games and it would be a different story if we were getting blown out by 40 points every week and there was no way to fix it,\" Sherman said. \"But there's one mistake, one play here that guys just need to clean up and correct.\" \nThe 49ers and Seahawks used to form one of the most compelling rivalries in the NFL because of their success and the history between coaches Pete Carroll and Jim Harbaugh. With Harbaugh at Michigan and Seattle and San Francisco currently tied for last in the NFC West, the hype is no longer. \nEven if Sherman downplayed the difference this year compared to years' past. \n\"It's no different than it was then,\" he said. \"It's the same old. One game at a time, another opponent, another opportunity to go out there and show what we can do.\" \nInjuries \nCenter Patrick Lewis (ankle), defensive tackle Jordan Hill (quad), linebacker Nick Moody (ankle), defensive tackle Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder), Sherman (ankle) and fullback Derrick Coleman (concussion) didn't participate in Tuesday's practice. Right tackle Garry Gilliam (ankle) was limited. \nCornerback Marcus Burley (wrist) practiced for the first time since he broke his thumb against the Lions on Oct. 5. \nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Seahawks news .
