(Photo: Instagram) \nThe officer said he smelled alcohol on Manziel's breath but that he didn't appear to be intoxicated. The officer said Crowley had bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and did appear intoxicated. \nCrowley cursed at the officer and stated: \"I didn't do anything wrong and my dad's a lawyer.\" \nPolice eventually released them both without charges. \nThe couple has been living together for two months, but Crowley said she is returning to Texas soon to finish her senior year at TCU. \nCrowley later posted on Instagram: \"J and I are good. I appreciate the people who stopped to check on us and call the police. I could see how it may have looked... Fortunately, it was just an argument, it was private and we are all good.\" YOU MAY ALSO LIKE...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:17:13.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
