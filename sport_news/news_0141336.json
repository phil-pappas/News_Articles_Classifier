According to Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, who is preparing his team to play at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Sunday afternoon, the Cowboys boast “the best offensive line in the league.” In left tackle Tyron Smith, center Travis Frederick and right guard Zack Martin, the Cowboys feature three offensive linemen they selected in the first round of the NFL draft (2011, 2013 and 2014, respectively) who went to the Pro Bowl last year. Right tackle Doug Free and left guard Ronald Leary, who have nine and three years’ NFL experience, respectively, round out the Cowboys’ offensive line. “They’re big, physical, they run well, and they play well together,” Ninkovich said. “I think that’s one common thing. A good offensive line plays well together and they communicate well. I think they do that at a high level. “It’s definitely a very good offensive line and a good challenge for us, and it starts (Wednesday) to get ready for that.” No reaction to Hardy: Signed as a free agent during the offseason and after kicking off his career with the Cowboys by serving a four-game suspension from the NFL for a domestic violence incident, pass-rushing defensive end Greg Hardy is scheduled to make his debut with the team on Sunday. Already, though, he’s made his presence felt. On Tuesday, Hardy told reporters in Dallas: “I love seeing Tom Brady … Have you seen his wife (Gisele)? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game (Gisele has five sisters, including her twin, Patricia), all her friends come to the game. (It’s) one of my favorite games of the year, guys.” The Patriots quarterback shrugged off Hardy’s comments Wednesday. “I’m just getting ready to play, man,” said Brady. “I’ve got to focus on my job. He’s a great player. It takes a lot of different things to handle a guy like that. “He’s been a great player since he’s been in the league so we’re going to have to prepare for him and be ready for all different types of moves that he’s got and they’ve got a good d-line, anyway. They count on getting pressure from their front four and getting to the quarterback so I don’t really care about his personal feelings.” Page 2 of 2 - Speaking to the New England media via a conference call, Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett “Typically, we try to keep things in-house here with the Cowboys,” said Garrett. “Greg’s excited to be playing and sometimes things come out of your mouth when you’re excited and I think he has an understanding it’s more important to define yourself by what you do as a player than anything else. So I think he’ll learn from those comments and the reaction to them. “I don’t think there was anything – there was no bad intent – I think he’s just excited to get back playing football.” 100 times two: Sunday’s game will be the 100th consecutive regular-season start for Brady, the second time in his career he’s reached that number since he succeeded Drew Bledsoe as the Patriots’ starter in 2001 (the first streak reached 111 games before he tore up his knee in the 2008 opener against Kansas City). “Well, I’m happy I’m available to my team,” said Brady. “I think that’s something I’ve always taken a lot of pride in, so trying to be out there and be a consistent, dependable player and certainly being available to those guys is what my job is. “It’s pretty fun. It’s great to go out there and play a lot of football, and I’ve been very fortunate to be protected so well by the offensive line. So a lot of good luck, it all helps.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:12:06.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
