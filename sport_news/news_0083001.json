His last full season in the AHL was 2007-08, when he went 38-38 for Bridgeport.\nWhile that was a long time ago, Tambellini said he expects the same rate of success in the AHL now. Saturday, he scored both goals for the Crunch on terrific shots from the right side.\n\"That's what I've always tried to bring to my game in pro hockey is an elite-level shot,'' Tambellini said. \"I got a chance to use it twice tonight. That (scoring) is my role. That's what I've done my whole career and I don't plan on changing that.''\nTambellini also has the obvious veteran's savvy. His first score came just 16 seconds into the game on a breakaway down the right side, and Tambellini said he felt it was important to test Sens rookie goalie Matt O'Connor with a quick bid.\n\"Any time you can catch a goalie, it was kind of a long wait, everybody is a little kind of rusty just to start the game,'' he said. \"When you can put a shot on there right away, usually good things happen.''\nDefenseman Anthony DeAngelo is a rookie in name only DeAngelo, a Tampa Bay first-round pick in 2014, looked poised and polished in his first contest in front of the home crowd. He recorded a helper on Tambellini's game-winner, skated on the penalty kill and was a point man on the first-unit power play.\n\"We do have a ton of confidence in him,'' said Crunch coach Rob Zettler. \"He's a talented, special player.''\nDeAngelo, who took turns with Crunch vets Matt Taormina and Joey Mormina, also showed he'll stand up for himself, trading jabs with Binghamton defenseman Mark Fraser behind one rush up ice.\nSyracuse Crunch Light Show Fans are treated to a light show to start off the Crunch home opener on Saturday night at the War Memorial.\n\"It's no big deal. Obviously, I won't back down from anybody,'' DeAngelo said. \"I'm looking forward to getting out there more and more and just getting more and more used to it. I didn't have many nerves tonight, which was good. It makes the the game easier for you.''\nDeAngelo had one bad pass that was picked off for a turnover, but he said in the big picture that was a good thing. It reinforced the lesson that passes he could have gotten away with in juniors won't fly in the AHL.\nTye McGinn has his teammates' backs\nThe 6-foot-3 McGinn was signed as a free agent to fill a much-needed power forward's role for Syracuse, and Saturday he showed his protective side.\nIt started when 5-9 Crunch forward Yanni Gourde lined up opposite Binghamton's Colin Greening on a faceoff. Gourde and the 6-3 Greening chirped before the puck dropped, and McGinn moved over to take Gourde's spot on the draw.\nMcGinn and Greening snarled at each other, and after the rubber hit ice their gloves quickly followed. They squared off for an extended bout in which both players landed several blows.\n\"We're slowly finding out what kind of character this guy has, and it's really high. He's an unreal teammate,'' Zettler said.\n\"When a bigger guy's going at it with a little guy, a bigger guy kind of steps in there,'' McGinn said. \"You don't always have to fight in those situations. But it was kind of a mutual agreement and I thought it was a pretty good fight. If I'm on the ice and something happens, I'll be the first one to jump in.''\nDifferent season, same shorty problem The Crunch tied for the AHL lead with 12 short-handed goals allowed last season, and the only score it surrendered on Saturday was a shorty by Cole Schneider in the second period.\nIt started when Syracuse forward Tanner Richard couldn't control a pass on the right point. Schneider beat Richard to the biscuit and powered past him for a breakaway on goalie Kristers Gudlevskis.\n\"I tried to get body position, and he kind of out-muscled me or lifted my stick. It's kind of a blur right now,'' Richard said. \"I just kind of know that he beat me in a one-on-one battle and that shouldn't be happening. Then he took it down and scored. So that one's pretty much on me.''\nIf Gudlevskis plays like this, the Crunch will be tough to beat The third-year netminder was outstanding with 27 saves.\n\"Guddy was really good,'' Zettler said. \"I didn't think we gave up a ton of chances, but the chances we gave up, there were a lot of Grade A chances. And he was there to stone them.''\nThe Crunch bench is still tight The expansion of the War Memorial rink to a regulation 200 feet also lengthened both benches. That was supposed to allow room for the backup goalies to sit on the bench during games instead of taking seats behind the doors leading to the locker rooms.\nBinghamton backup Chris Driedger plopped down on his team's bench during the action, but Crunch backup Adam Wilcox remained on a chair in the aisle.\n\"Even though there's more room, it's still tight. It just gives you more room to move around,'' Zettler said.\nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LindsayKramerPS", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIi-6QN5G_E"], "published": "2015-10-18T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:53:44.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
