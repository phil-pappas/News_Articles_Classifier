Cox/Getty Images \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story NAPA, Calif. — Rory McIlroy’s success is built on quick calculations, such as determining the yardage he has left to the flag after a booming drive on a long par 4. But the math did not add up on the column of figures he was recently studying. In a 365-day span, McIlroy spent 287 nights in hotels and the equivalent of 14 days on airplanes. An accounting of a recent 12-month chunk of his life revealed that McIlroy had 18 days off after fulfilling his professional obligations. He hardly had enough time to recharge, much less refine his game. The continuous loop of golf seasons creates a time crunch that is especially acute for McIlroy, who is starting a new season on the PGA Tour this week at the Frys.com Open before heading abroad for the conclusion of the 2015 European Tour campaign. OCT. 9, 2015 Since the start of the calendar year, McIlroy has seen his world ranking slip from No. 1 to No. 3, behind Jordan Spieth and Jason Day. Their superior short games, McIlroy said, caused him to address in practice “a few of the areas that I’m not maybe quite as good as they are.” Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week. Ball-striking carried McIlroy to the summit and kept him there for 95 nonconsecutive weeks. His fall prompted him to reassess his approach of spending more time on the range than on the green. Like many athletes, McIlroy prefers the ego boost of working on what he does well to the discomfort of confronting his shortcomings. On Wednesday, he appeared committed to following the example of Phil Mickelson, who took what he had read in a college psychology text about overcoming a fear by facing it and applied it to golf by working on uncomfortable shots until they become strengths. See More » “It’s just trying to keep the strengths as strong as I can and chip away at the weaknesses,” McIlroy said. “I sometimes felt last season I neglected those weaknesses too much to focus on the strength. For me, that is my ball-striking and hitting fairways and greens and giving myself plenty of opportunities for birdies. You can do that all day, and you’re going to play well and have good finishes, but I felt like my putting definitely could have been better this year.” But how will he carve out the time to improve on anything? The 2014-15 PGA Tour season ended on the final weekend in September. McIlroy, 26, is playing during four of the next six weeks, including the final three events in Europe, where he is the season-long points leader. In a golf utopia, officials from all of the world’s tours would get together and arrange their schedules so there existed a period of six to eight weeks without a single competitive event. That would allow the players a chance to catch their breath, build their stamina and rebuild their swings and would afford fans of the game a chance to miss it. The reality is that the game’s gatekeepers will overschedule their marquee players in the name of pleasing their corporate partners and providing tournament starts for as many players as possible. So each man is left to build his own breaks into the schedule. McIlroy will take off all of December and most of January, which means he will skip the Tournament of Champions in Maui, for which he qualified by winning two Tour events in 2014-15. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Of course, as he pointed out, he already had an unscheduled layoff after spraining his left ankle in July while playing pickup soccer with friends. The injury caused him to miss the British Open. After being sidelined for six weeks, he returned for four tournaments, starting with the P.G.A. Championship, before the season ran out on him. “I guess coming back at the P.G.A. for me was a start of a new season,” McIlroy said, adding, “This is sort of a continuation of that. Even though it’s the new PGA Tour season, I feel like I’m in the middle of a nice little run to the end of the year.” McIlroy, a four-time major winner, can complete a career Slam with a victory in the Masters. His focus is his performance in the majors, which is why three victories worldwide between January and May did not impress him much. “I feel like I’m at a point in my career where a great season is defined by major championships,” McIlroy said, adding, “So it was a lost year in the fact that I didn’t win a major and add to that tally.” McIlroy is playing this week to fulfill an obligation he made in 2012 to the PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem. He promised to play in the Frys.com Open at least once between 2013 and now after he had been freed by the Tour to participate in a lucrative nonsanctioned event in Turkey that took place the same week as this event. McIlroy traveled here from Europe on Tuesday, adding a few thousand more airline miles and a few more nights away from home to his yearly totals. “It’s crazy numbers,” McIlroy acknowledged, adding, “No way I could sustain that for the rest of my career.” But he does not intend to slow down any time soon. “For now, that’s the life I live,” McIlroy said. “I’m enjoying it.” Loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:46:47.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
