It took until October -- and they needed overtime to do it against the Brandon Weeden -led Cowboys -- but whatever, it counts. And 1-3 is better than 0-4, especially when the Panthers and Falcons are sitting atop the NFC South at 4-0. \nDrew Brees also returned after missing last week's game with a bruised rotator cuff. And while he was his usual efficient self -- 33 of 41 for 359 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions -- he still didn't look completely healthy. He rarely threw downfield, instead settling for short and intermediate passes, but he was good enough to beat a Cowboys defense that was manhandled by the Falcons last week. \n(This is where we note that Brees' arm looked plenty strong here, late in the fourth quarter , but the larger point is that these passes were relatively infrequent on Sunday.) \nThe good news is that, barring a setback, Brees will only get healthier and stronger. The bigger question is whether the offense can find consistent playmakers to help him, and more importantly, if that 31st-ranked defense can improve. Because let's be honest: Rob Ryan isn't going to have the luxury of going up against a Weeden-led offense while Tony Romo and Dez Bryant \nDrews Brees celebrates his game-winning touchdown throw. (USATSI \n1. It was a perfect ending to Brees' evening. Moments before Brees and C.J. Spiller connected on what amounted to an 80-yard pitch and catch, it looked very much like the Saints didn't want to win this game (more on that in a second). But New Orleans won the toss, got the ball first in overtime, and never gave the Cowboys' offense a chance to take the field. \n#DALvsNO October 5, 2015 \npic.twitter.com/o6EfMXCg9e — #DALvsNO () October 5, 2015 \nEarlier in the game, Brees surpassed 5,000 career completions, second behind only Brett Favre (6,300) Peyton Manning (6,025). Oh, and Brees also holds the NFL record for 54 consecutive games with a touchdown pass . \n2. Here's why the game even went to overtime: An optimist might say that kicker \npic.twitter.com/H41Rp02bAZ — Stephen Garcia () October 5, 2015 \nWho is that man and what is he doing? \n3. Brandon Weeden was sorta clutch down the stretch. The Cowboys (2-2) trailed 20-13 with 4:05 to go in the fourth quarter and the ball on their own 9-yard line. So naturally, Weeden engineered an eight-play drive that included 39-yard completion to tight end Jason Weeden and a \"NO WAY THAT JUST HAPPENED\" 17-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams on fourth-and-7. \nThe Cowboys tie it up! pic.twitter.com/KyC35LIA0N — HuffPost Sports () October 5, 2015 \nEven Dez Bryant was impressed. \nDub that's how you keep fighting nice ass catch!!!! — Dez Bryant () October 5, 2015 \n4. Weeden was slightly less conservative against the Saints. A week ago, Weeden completed 22 of 26 passes for 232 yards, but none of those completions went to outside receivers. On Sunday, he was slightly more adventurous (see above), and finished 16 of 26 for 246 yards and a touchdown. Weeden still seemed to look short often, and almost never looked left for a receiver. Of course, one of the few times he did -- early in the third quarter -- he found Brice Butler for 67 yards. \nWeeden looked left again on the very next play, an incompletion, before going back to his right twice more (incompletion, sack). The Cowboys settled for a field goal. We suspect that as Weeden becomes more comfortable he'll use the entire field. And this showing further cements his place as the starter in Romo's absence, even with the recent addition of Matt Cassel . \n5. Random fact you already knew: Hey, Weeden played baseball! \n@MLB & @NFL Drafts () October 5, 2015 \n7. Cowboys injuries continue to mount ... \nBefore \nTOUCHDOWN pic.twitter.com/bHmPBGXXuq — SB Nation () October 5, 2015 \nAnd linebacker Sean Lee , who had a solid start to the season, left in the first half with a concussion. He didn't return, and now he'll have to go through the league's concussion protocol before he can play again. \nWhich brings us to this tweet, via ESPN's Darren Rovell: \nThe Dallas Cowboys #Injuries (via", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:00:27.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
