Karolina has had an excellent season,” he added. \nRussia have called up world number three Maria Sharapova, 24th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (31) and Elena Vesnina (111). \nVesnina and Makarova are in the top ten of the WTA doubles rankings, ranked seventh and ninth, respectively. \nThe two nations have met five times in the Fed Cup before but three of those meetings were between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. \nThe Czech team lead their head-to-head record with Russia 3-2, including a victory in the most recent encounter in the 2011 final in Moscow. \nThe Czechs have won the trophy eight times, including five victories as Czechoslovakia which went on to split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. \nFour-time champions Russia, who are trying to bounce back from a disappointing 2014 season, when they lost 4-0 to Australia in their opening round clash, will be playing in their 11th Fed Cup final overall. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:23:29.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
