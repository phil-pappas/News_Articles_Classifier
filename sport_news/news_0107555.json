They deserve this.\" \nFranklin's first-round opponent will be revealed during Sunday's 7 p.m. MHSAA Selection Show on Fox Sports Detroit. \nThe Patriots' will watch the show just like they beat Royal Oak — together. \nFranklin got off on the right foot when Rob Erwin hauled in a 65-yard TD pass from senior quarterback Denzel Adams on the first play of the game. \nAfter Royal Oak evened the contest at 6-6, the Patriots scored back-to-back touchdowns: the first on a 4-yard keeper by Adams and the second on Chris Nehasil's 2-yard plunge. Jake Giacobbi booted both extra points to give the Patriots a 20-6 advantage before the Ravens scored with six seconds left in the first half. \nFranklin's football team comes together following Friday's playoffs-clinching win over Royal Oak. (Photo: NANCY ERWIN) \nThe Patriots received a nice omen on the second-half kick-off when they recovered an unintentional onside kick near mid-field. A few plays later Jacob Clark scored to make it 27-13. \nAdams scored the final two touchdowns for the winners — both in the third quarter. \nClark had a huge night for Franklin, picking up 172 yards on 14 carries. Adams added 158 yards on 14 attempts. He also completed 6 of 7 passes for 101 yards. 447 CONNECT 20 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.hometownlife.com/story/sports/2015/10/24/livonia-franklin-defeats-royal-oak/74523408/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:53:29.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
