He expects Harstfield will take three visits between Nov. 15 - the end of the East Coast Prep season - and Dec. 15, but said that could change if he falls in love with a school. \nHartsfield had committed to Penn State last year before a hazing scandal at Sayreville that ended up in the cancellation of the season . None of the players involved were publicly named because they were minors , but police did go to Hartsfield's house . \nPenn State reportedly pulled its scholarship offer in the wake of the scandal, and Harstfield decided to attend the Massachusetts prep school. \nBell said the five schools most interested in Hartsfield have been UCLA, Boston College, Temple, East Carolina and West Virginia but that he had 15-20 schools looking at him. Bell added since Hartsfield is visiting Rutgers, he would put the Scarlet Knights in the mix with the other five contenders. \nProfiles on all the players just went up on the East Coast Prep web site that often drives more attention to the athletes, according to Bell. The staff left the following comment on Hartsfield: BCS ATHLETE, SUB 4.4 SPEED, CAN PLAY EITHER SIDE OF BALL AND RETURN, WR ON OFFENSE, CB ON DEFENSE, QUALIFIER, GREAT YOUNG MAN, GOOD WORKER, DEDICATED, COUD BE NFL DOWN THE ROAD. \nHarstfield talked exclusively with NJ.com after East Coast Prep played the Penn JV at Franklin Field in Philadelphia this year. \nBecause of the attention involved in the situation and the need to put time between the scandal and his college career , Hartsfield said he felt it was best to attend East Coast Prep, a one-semester program in Massachusetts. \nHartsfield has not spoken publicly about his involvement, if any, in the scandal. \nTHE Q&A: Myles Hartsfield talks to NJ.com \nBell said Harstfield doesn't have any offers, but considers it a matter of time. The 6-foot, 195-pounder could play defensive back or wide receiver at the next level and is also a dynamic return man. \n\"The situation is pretty simple,\" said Bell. \"They're going to want to meet the kid before they offer him, and that's not going to happen before he visits. \n\"He's good enough to play at any school. The greatest impression he will make is when he's sitting in front of someone.\" \nWhen he talked in Philadelphia, Hartsfield said he looked forward to that opportunity to meet coaches face-to-face. That's how he sold Bell on taking him at East Coast Prep. \n\"What I really wanted to express was the part about Myles' Hartsfield's character,\" said Hartsfield. \"(Bell) didn't know much of what happened. Me and my dad went up to Massachusetts and expressed to him. ... We didn't want him to know until I told him. I wanted him to know my character and not what the media says. \n\"If you look at what happened on the Internet, you'll see Myles Hartsfield is a bad person and an animal. I didn't want him to judge me on my character through the media. I wanted him to judge me on what I say.\" \nHartsfield knows he'll have to answer questions about the scandal from college coaches and that's a process that could happen this weekend at Rutgers. \n\"It's something I'm going to have to deal with the rest of my life,\" said Hartsfield back in September. \"That question about Sayreville is going to come up everywhere and me and my parents worked on it every day. Every interview the No. 1 question is what happened at Sayreville? I've progressed in speaking, being in front of people and talking. \n\"A lot of (coaches) ask the same question. Wherever I go, I'm going to have to tell the story. I'm going to have to tell the story to the head man, the president, the AD for them to be comfortable with me.\" \nBell feels Harstfield will make a favorable impression. \n\"When they meet him, they'll find out he's a great kid,\" said Bell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:29:17.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
