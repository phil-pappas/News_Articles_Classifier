Let me start this column out with a bit of a disclaimer: I am a diehard Houston Astros fan. This column will have my highest intentions of being objective. That having been said, the Kansas City Royals have their work cut out for them as they try to advance past the American League Divisional Series. The Royals head to Houston with the series tied up 1-1 after a come-from-behind victory in the later innings of Friday’s ballgame at Kauffman Stadium. Unfortunately, Kansas City’s upcoming away games are going to be much more difficult to win for a couple of significant reasons. If you have paid attention to any of the coverage from the major television networks on the ALDS, then you’ve heard how poorly the Astros play on the road. On the other side of the coin, they are dominant at Minute Maid Park, boasting an AL best 53-28 record as the home team this year. It would be fair to say the Royals have momentum coming into Game 3 after winning in dramatic fashion Friday. Anytime a team can get a comeback win late in a game against the an opposing bullpen, it provides a necessary confidence moving forward. That poise is huge considering the Royals suffered a loss in the opener. If Kansas City had dropped the second game, the ALDS would have been all but over with what they have waiting for them back at Houston. With the team being rejuvenated, the Royals are back in a position to take command of the series with a win Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately, it’s not just the home-field advantage the Astros have that’s working against them. Kansas City is on tap to square off against the top pair of pitchers the Astros' rotation featured this season. The goal for Kansas City at this point in the series is to force a fifth game by splitting with the Astros in Houston. That will be easier said than done, though. Sunday’s matchup puts Royals right hander Edinson Volquez (13-9, 3.55 ERA) up against Astros southpaw Dallas Keuchel (20-8, 2.48 ERA). If the Royals come away with a win in Game 3, consider it the biggest upset in the postseason because Keuchel doesn’t lose at home. That’s not me being a homer either. He garners a 15-0 record with an ERA of 1.46 when he toes the rubber in front of his home crowd. If the Royals are to have any chance in Game 3, they have to get early runs against Kuechel, who has had a propensity to allow teams scoring opportunities in the first couple of innings before he settles in. If Houston continues the trend of the first two games by scoring in the early goings against Kansas City and holding them off the scoreboard, Keuchel will find his rhythm and Royals will find themselves down 2-1. Page 2 of 2 - The stronger chance the Royals have of forcing a Game 5 back in Kansas City will come Monday, when Houston rookie righty Lance McCullers Jr. (6-7, 3.22) faces up against Royals right hander Yordano Ventura (13-8, 4.08). Ventura took the loss in Game 1 after he was removed following the hour-long rain delay, and you can be sure he will be primed and ready to go with the spotlight squarely on his shoulders. Even though he gave up early runs in the first inning against the Astros Thursday, Ventura had success earlier in the season against the Astros, tossing seven innings of one-run ball on July 26 at home. McCullers is coming into the game with confidence as well, beating the Royals in Houston on June 29, allowing one run on four hits in seven innings, striking out six in the win. There is a weakness to his game, however. When the rookie isn't right, he throws a lot of pitches, and that’s where the Royals can take advantage. If Kansas City can force McCullers out of the game early and get into the Astros’ less-than-stellar bullpen with the game still in reach, Royals fans have a good chance to find themselves at Kauffman Stadium for Game 5. The theme for the series for all Royals fans should be wanting to face the Astros' bullpen for as many outs as possible. The Royals have several advantages coming into the pair of games in Houston, having a deeper lineup with more balanced hitters as well as the experience having gone through a deep playoff run with their backs against the wall last season. Climbing out of the current hole they are in and getting home-field advantage back will be a challenge, but the Royals didn’t finish with the best record in the American League for no reason. If they can find a way to force a Game 5 in Kansas City, the Royals have a strong chance to make a second-straight appearance in the American League Championship Series.
