Everyone loves debating the merits of one player against another.\nHere we get to do both, breaking down the top 100 players in the NBA heading into the 2015-16 season.\nTo be clear: This list is strictly for this season. It doesn’t factor in potential, which is why you only see one rookie. It’s also why you don’t see someone like Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who is out for the season with a torn labrum.\nSit back, read through, see where you agree — and where you don’t.\nPart 1: 100-51 Timberwolves No. 1 pick Karl-Anthony Towns Photo: The Canadian Press via AP 100.

Danilo Gallinari, SF, Nuggets \nFinally healthy, he looked terrific at the end of last season and in Eurobasket.\n65. Nikola Mirotic, PF, Bulls \nExcelled as a rookie, and may be a starter ahead of Joakim Noah.\n64. DeMar DeRozan, SG, Raptors \nNeeds to develop a 3-point shot to take the next step as a player.\n63.
