The COC said it hasn't received any other complaints, although other women have given interviews to Quebec media accusing Aubut of sexually harassing them.\nThe 67-year-old native of Saint-Hubert-de-Riviere-du-Loup, Que., was emotional, his hands shaking at times, as he said he'd never thought about his behaviour in 45 years of professional life.\n\"Today, the wake-up call is brutal,\" he said. \"I have an enormous, an enormous, lots of, lots of, sorrow. I infinitely regret having hurt so many people who certainly did not deserve it. I hope that one day these people will be able to forgive me.\n\"I have already begun consulting the best experts who will help me to change my behaviour and become a better person.\"\nAmid the current crisis, he said he he understands that society has changed and that it \"demands greater respect between individuals, more specifically between men and women.\"\n\"I assume full responsibility for my actions,\" Aubut said just before leaving through a side door. \"I have nobody else to blame but myself.\"\nLa Presse and the Globe and Mail both reported a letter written by the then CEO of the COC to Aubut in 2011 indicated high-ranking people in the organization were uncomfortable with his conduct toward women.\nInterim COC president Tricia Smith said this week the organization's board was not aware of \"any specific interactions that would be construed as harassment.\"\nSmith insisted the board did not know about the letter but said an independent body has been asked to look into the circumstances of the June 2011 letter.\nAubut became a board member of the COC in 2000 and took over as president in 2010.\nOn Friday, his law firm confirmed Aubut's immediate departure, with Andre Morrissette, the chair of the board at BCF, wishing him the best of luck as he seeks help.\n\"Mr. Aubut and his family are going through an extremely difficult period,\" Morrissette said in a statement.\n\"Mr. Aubut acknowledged his mistakes this morning and he takes responsibility for his actions We welcome this gesture in undoubtedly difficult circumstances.\"\nAubut previously served as chief executive officer of the NHL's Quebec Nordiques until the team moved to Colorado in 1995. He notably helped retired NHL hockey players Anton, Marian and Peter Stastny defect from communist Czechoslovakia to Canada in 1980 to play in Quebec City.\nHe is both an officer of the Order of Canada and of the National Order of Quebec and was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:58:15.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
