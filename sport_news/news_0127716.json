Here's a look at the biggest movers and shakers in his poll this week. \nTeam on the rise \n* Florida: The Gators beat down No. 3-ranked Mississippi, 38-10, and vaulted from unranked to No. 10. Florida had close wins over East Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee, but this was a rout. First-year coach Jim McElwain has Florida on the right track; Colorado State should have held on for the full buyout price. \nTeam on the fall \n* UCLA: I was high on the Bruins, placing them at No. 5 last week (they were seven in the AP poll; 10th in the coaches poll), but UCLA fell flat in a 38-23 loss to Arizona State. The Pac-12 is still wide open, but the Bruins took a bad home loss and paid the price by tumbling to No. 16 on my ballot. \nHuge win for Clemson \n* Entering the week, the ACC looked like the conference most likely to be squeezed out of the playoffs. But after Clemson knocked off Notre Dame, 24-22, that might not be the case anymore. Given the weakness of the ACC, Clemson needed this big non-league win. I moved the Tigers from 12th to fifth. \nThe Big 12 sleeper \n* It’s not often you can call Oklahoma a “sleeper,” but with TCU and Baylor being the name teams in the Big 12 this season, the Sooners have snuck in under the radar. Oklahoma’s next five games are highly winnable. Wins those and the Sooners are 9-0 heading into back-to-back games against TCU and Baylor. \nChris Murray’s AP Top 25 \n1.
