(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) Sponsored Links The Associated Press COLLEGE PARK, Md. â€” \nJim Harbaugh was joined on the Michigan sideline Saturday by his brother John, who offered advice and cheered for the Wolverines in a 28-0 win over Maryland. \nJohn Harbaugh usually spends Saturdays during football season getting his Baltimore Ravens ready to play on Sunday. But because the Ravens were in Pittsburgh on Thursday and Michigan was playing nearby, John got the chance to be with his brother. \nAt the start of the game, John Harbaugh stood at the end of the Michigan bench. By the second quarter, he was standing next to Jim. \nAfterward, Jim said, \"He gave really good input during the game. It was great to have him here.\" \nThe Harbaughs are the only brothers in NFL history to coach against each other in a Super Bowl. John's Ravens beat Jim and the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in 2013.
