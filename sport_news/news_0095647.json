It's fair. It's simple. And, best of all, levying the 10-cent tax would require buy-in from voters. Good luck with that part, by the way.\nThere's no doubt the city's roads need work, and raising local gas taxes is a reasonable way to generate some of the necessary money. Unfortunately, the state Legislature this year placed a great, big pothole in the City Council's path by rescuing Oregon's controversial low-carbon fuel standard . The state expects the mandate, designed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, to raise fuel prices by up to 19 cents per gallon over several years. Not a penny of this will be used to fix roads, as Portland voters will know when they cast their gas-tax ballots, as Novick would like, next May.\nEditorial Agenda 2015\nMake Portland a city that works Get pot right Smart choices for education\nHelp rural Oregon\nKeep people and goods moving\nFoster small business growth\nTrack health reforms\nRead more about the editorial board's priorities for Oregon.\nAlmost certain to participate in the public-information campaign will be fuel distributors and gas stations represented by lobbyist Paul Romain, who told The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board Monday that his clients are likely to campaign against Portland's gas tax unless the Legislature revisits the low-carbon fuel standard. Romain said months ago that his clients will force a public vote on any statewide hike in fuel taxes unless lawmakers revisit the fuel mandate.\nIf state and local officials aren't gnawing their fingernails over the possibility of such a campaign, they should be. Fuel-tax increases tend to be unpopular among voters, and Portland residents already pay a 3-cent-per-gallon tax levied by Multnomah County. Meanwhile, everyone who receives a ballot is capable of factoring in the inflationary effect of the low-carbon fuel standard, which will do nothing for either roads or the environment. The contribution of Oregon's cars and trucks to global carbon dioxide emissions is vanishingly small .\nHere, then, is the math Portland voters will be doing next spring: 10 cents (the local gas tax hike), plus up to 19 cents within several years (the carbon standard) plus an unknown statewide tax hike. That's right, there's more to come, at least if Oregonians value well-maintained roads everywhere, as they should. Democrats in the Legislature chose to save the low-carbon fuel standard this year knowing that doing so would undermine any effort to pass a road-funding package during the same session. The plan now, it seems, is to do it in 2017 , by which point legislative leaders seem to believe Oregonians will have forgotten about the fuel standard.

Among those who may be keenly aware of gas prices in 2017 are Portlanders, who by that time may have approved Novick's local tax. Without their support, a statewide gas tax has little chance of passage. But many of them will wonder why they should pay more at the pump when they've already raised taxes to fix local roads. For this reason, Novick's proposal would make a statewide hike in the gas tax less likely even without the added complication of the low-carbon mandate.\nIt would be tempting to chastise the Legislature at this point for creating such unnecessary headaches for Portland. But a couple of facts get in the way. One is that most Democratic legislators representing Portland and surrounding areas voted for the fuel mandate. The other is that Novick and his four colleagues on City Council sent lawmakers a letter in support of the mandate, calling it \"part of the City of Portland's commitment to promoting a prosperous, low-carbon economy.\"\nSpeaking of prosperous, guess who really, really, really likes the mandate? Chemical giant DuPont, which explained in a recent guest column that it needs requirements like Oregon's to generate business for its new cellulosic ethanol plant ... in Iowa. So much for keeping Oregonians' fuel dollars from flowing out of state, which was a favorite argument of mandate supporters.\nBut we digress.\nA good way for lawmakers to ease the paths of both local and statewide hikes in the gas tax is to pull the plug on the low-carbon fuel standard during the 2016 session. Novick and his colleagues would do their constituents a service by sending legislative leaders a letter to that end. Alternatively, they should prepare to explain why Portlanders ought to support a local gas tax knowing that a statewide tax hike is on the horizon and an effective climate-change tax headed for the pump.", "external_links": ["https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2015R1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/48576"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:25:12.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
