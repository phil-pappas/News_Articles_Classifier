He also was the biggest challenge for the St. Louis Cardinals, who insist they will be ready for the first playoff game at Wrigley Field in seven years.\n\"We've gone up against a number of teams and a number of pitchers where everybody kind of ruled us out and said you can't do this or that, and I think this team has responded well in the past,\" Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.\nThe past includes two wins against Clayton Kershaw in last year's playoffs. It also includes a victory over Arrieta in May, but that was long before he went on one of the most dominant runs baseball has ever seen.\nArrieta is 17-1 with a microscopic 0.81 ERA in his last 21 starts. The stretch includes a no-hitter against the NL West champion Los Angeles Dodgers, and a five-hit shutout at Pittsburgh in the wild-card game last Wednesday.\nObit: Dean Chance, who won the 1964 Cy Young Award and later pitched a no-hitter, died Sunday. He was 74. There were no details on the cause of death. Chance died two months after being at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Calif., for his induction into the Angels Hall of Fame. In 1964, Chance went 20-9 with a 1.65 ERA for the Angels and won the Cy Young â€” from 1956-66, only one pitcher in the majors won the award each year. Chance threw a no-hitter for Minnesota in August 1967. Chance went 128-115 with a 2.92 ERA in 10 seasons. He began with the expansion Los Angeles Angels in 1961 and also pitched for Minnesota, Cleveland, the Mets and Detroit. He was a two-time All-Star.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:14:50.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
