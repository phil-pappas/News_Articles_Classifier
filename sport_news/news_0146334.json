He must be drooling at the possibilities for Sunday, right? \n\"No, not really,\" Bennett said. \"A lot of teams treat me differently from how they treat other tight ends as far as attention goes. I'm pretty sure they're going to have a different way of covering me, doing different things to try to prevent me from getting off.\" \nThe Raiders better do something different because the early returns have been bad. \nCleveland Browns tight end Gary Barnidge, an eighth-year player who has never had more than 13 receptions in a season, torched the Raiders for six catches and 105 yards -- both career highs -- and a touchdown in Oakland's 27-20 win last week. \nThe Baltimore Ravens' Crockett Gillmore caught only 10 passes during his rookie season last year, but had six grabs for 88 yards and two touchdowns against the Raiders in Week 2. The receptions and yards both account for around 30 percent of his career totals through 18 games. \nTyler Eifert at least has some pedigree to him as a former first-round pick in 2013, but the Cincinnati Bengals' tight end had never delivered close to the nine-catch, 104-yard, two-touchdown performance he had in the season opener, Oakland's only loss this year. Advertisement \nThe total damage from opposing tight ends so far: 21 catches, 305 yards and five touchdowns. \n\"You have to give them a lot of credit,\" Raiders defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr. said. \"You can't just say, 'Hey, we can't stop all the tight ends.' They're professionals as well. We're working on it, and that's another area of improvement for us.\" \nA good chance to show improvement is against Bennett, who had career highs of 90 catches, 916 yards and six touchdowns last season with Chicago. He's the Bears' leading receiver with 13 catches for 118 yards and a touchdown through three games this season. \n\"It will be a tough matchup for us,\" Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said. \"We're getting prepared to meet the challenge.\" \nBennett's impact could be lessened if Jimmy Clausen makes the start at quarterback. But if Jay Cutler goes -- he figures to be a game-time decision -- there's a good bet he'll target Bennett as much as possible. \nThe Raiders biggest issue is, too often, tight ends are getting free releases off the line of scrimmage and getting downfield without being touched or even picked up. It's been bad enough that Del Rio joked earlier this week that teams have placed cloaking devices over their tight ends to make them invisible. \nOn the biggest plays over the first three games, the tight ends have been lined up with a pass rusher across from them whose responsibility is to get after the quarterback. It's typically the job of the linebacker or safety to pick him up in the second level and that's where the breakdowns have occurred. Bennett said he expects that to change. \n\"I go into every game prepared to see blanket coverage and have to work to get open every single play,\" he said. \"When you see people have success, that team is doing everything they can to correct it, so I feel like this week will still be a challenge.\" \nSafety Charles Woodson, playing through a dislocated shoulder, was beaten in coverage deep on Barnidge's longest reception last week, a 40-yarder. That came after Barnidge scooted past middle linebacker Curtis Lofton and raced past Woodson on a post route. It's the type of play opposing coordinators will be eager to call until the Raiders can stop it. \n\"We have to be more aware of them,\" Norton said of the tight ends. \"We have to certainly pair our defenses better. We have to improve that. That's one of our purposes to improve this week.\" For more on the Raiders, visit the Inside the Oakland Raiders blog at ibabuzz.com/oaklandraiders .
