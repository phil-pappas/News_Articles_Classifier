PICTURE: ANNA ROGERS Source: News Limited \nCAIRNS schoolgirl Olivia Firth wasn’t even born when the Cowboys last made the NRL grand final. \nBut as a third-generation supporter, the seven-year-old will be cheering louder than ever tonight when the club strives to finally secure its elusive maiden premiership. \nOlivia’s mum, Hayley, and grandmother, Jacky, know all too well what a Cowboys win would mean for the region. \nFor years they have watched their heroes fall painfully short of glory. \n“They’ve come close on so many occasions, it’d be such a boost for the town,” Hayley said. “We’ll have to go to Townsville if they have a victory parade.” \nAs members, Jacky, Hayley and Olivia have been to countless home games and now feel part of the “Cowboys family”. \nHayley said mingling with the players at club functions was always special for fans. \n“We met Ben Hannant and Lachlan Coote, and even had a photo with JT,” she said. \n“They’re very community-minded people, whether it’s visiting hospitals or supporting the kids. The Cowboys have done a lot for rugby league in North Queensland.” \nWhile she dubbed Johnathan Thurston a “club legend”, Hayley said players like Matt Bowen and Brent Tate also deserved recognition for making the Cowboys successful. \nThe diehard trio will be glued to the TV at Jacky’s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:33:47.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
