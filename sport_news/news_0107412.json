Skyline and Wasatch follow at 1:15 p.m., Fremont and nationally-rated Davis at 3:45 p.m. and Lone Peak and Weber at 6 p.m. \nThe Timberwolves take an 8-5-3 record into the first semifinal against the Bees (11-6-1), who stunned host Timpview in the quarterfinals via a shootout, 4-2. \nWasatch (14-1-3) carries arguably the best defense in the state into the semifinals, where it will look to build on its 0.6 team goals-against average and 9.7 saves per game from goalkeeper Torri Bills. The Eagles (16-1-1), meanwhile, are looking to get back to the state final a year after falling via a penalty shootout, 7-6 to the Timberwolves. \nDavis charges into its 5A semifinal against Fremont with a 19-0 record, but the Darts needed extra time to hold off American Fork, 2-1 in the quarterfinals. Davis is currently ranked No. 32 in the nation and No. 1 in the state by MaxPreps. \nThe Silver Wolves (16-0-2) rolled by Herriman, 6-2 in the quarterfinals and have outscored their two playoff opponents 9-3. \nIn the final match of the day at 6 p.m., Lone Peak (15-3) puts its three-game shutout streak to the test against Weber (13-2-1). The Knights haven't allowed a goal since a 2-1 win Oct. 6 against Herriman, and have picked up playoff victories of 6-0 over Bingham and 2-0 over Mountain Crest. \nThe Warriors rolled by Syracuse, 4-1 and held off Lehi, 2-1 to book their spot in the semifinals. \nWatch the game live via the video embedded above, or at live.ksl.com beginning at 11 a.m. MT .
