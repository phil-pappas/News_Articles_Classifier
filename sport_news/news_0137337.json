Comment Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 9:00 AM WHITE CASTLE The skid continued for Ascension Catholic last Friday night as they hit the road for a matchup against 12th-ranked White Castle. The Bulldogs were dominated, 38-7, to fall victim to their fourth straight loss. Ascension Catholic began the year with a promising 53-25 victory over Catholic High of Point Coupee, but ever since, they have struggled mightily. Much of those struggles have been the result of a brutal schedule. They first dropped a road game to 2A Dunham before facing back-to-back teams in 1A's top-10. They were beaten, 70-46, by seventh-ranked Central Catholic, and then 46-7 by second-ranked Southern Lab. Seeking their first district win, they took to the road for another tough matchup against a team just outside of the top 10 in White Castle. The Bulldogs of White Castle dominated from the very beginning. Much of their dominance came on the ground--where they chewed up 327 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Quarterback Jeremy Richard only had to throw the ball five times, but he completed four of his passes. Two of those completions went for touchdowns. Richard also ran for another score. For the second straight week, the Ascension Catholic offense had their share of struggles. They were held out of the end zone in the loss to White Castle. Their only score came from the only player that scored the week earlier against Southern Lab: Kaleb Winchester. Winchester scored on an 80-yard kickoff return. The loss not only dropped Ascension Catholic to 1-4 overall, but it also put them in an 0-2 hole in District 6-1A play. They'll be looking to turn things around this week as their Homecoming rolls around. They will be hosting district and parish rival Ascension Christian. The Lions are having one of their best seasons in school history as they enter the matchup at 3-2. Ascension Catholic has beaten Ascension Christian four years in a row. Last season, the Bulldogs crushed the Lions, 62-7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:15:24.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
