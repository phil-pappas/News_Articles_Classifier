But Harbaugh was asked why U-M only ran three plays essentially up the middle instead of more time-consuming to the outside.\n\"That's a thought, you can run sweep plays to the boundary, extend the play, might extend it six or seven seconds, been in that situation before too and had the ballcarrier go out of bounds,\" Harbaugh said on the Big Ten teleconference. \"Yeah, that was a thought. It's always been my experience when I like to kick a field goal or not kick a field goal or run or pass, you'd love to have the opportunity to do it again and see how the other way worked.\"\nOn first down, U-M tailback De'Veon Smith was running outside but cut upfield just to the left of the right hash and, after being tackled for a four-yard gain, the play took five seconds down to 1:42 before MSU called timeout.\nSmith took the next handoff and danced a bit but gained two yards, going up the right hash and Harbaugh called the timeout himself with 56 seconds left and only one second left on the play clock.\nOn third down and three, Smith ran right of the right hash and fought for only one yard, and U-M milked to clock down to one second left, again, with Harbaugh calling timeout, leaving the fateful fourth-and-2 with 10 seconds left.\nNFL/College rumors 'disrespectful' : Just as it was last fall, though for a different reason, Harbaugh's name has come up in NFL circles for coaching vacancies.\nHe was mentioned with the Miami Dolphins opening, where Joe Philbin was already fired and Indianapolis, where Chuck Pagano is still coaching but reported to have issues with his management. A similar rift is what hastened Harbaugh's departure from San Francisco after last season.\n\"I won't comment on it, it's disrespectful to the game,\" he said. \"I look at it as disrespectful.\"\nNote: Harbaugh credited MSU's defense for the Wolverines' struggles running the ball, saying it was \"stout\"\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
