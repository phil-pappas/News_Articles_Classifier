A 13-yard loss on a sack in the second quarter. \nIt didn't happen often, but when Upper Dublin erred, Stover was quick with an answer for the Cardinals. \nAfter the loss of 3, he launched a 56-yard pass to wideout Cole Swiger, which set up a 3-yard touchdown run from Kaleif Lee, the first of his two scores. \nStover responded to the sack with back-to-back 19-yard completions, and then capped the drive off with a 22-yard strike to Danny Boggs. \nBut the most significant cleanup, the one that set the tone for the rest of the evening, didn't come on a subsequent play. It came on the following drive. \nOn Upper Dublin's second drive of the evening, Jack Rapine, making his first start at tight end, fumbled a catch deep in Upper Moreland territory. \nRather than get frustrated, Stover and Rapine talked it over on the sideline. And in a minute, it was behind them. \"We just wiped the slate clean,\" Stover indicated. \"It was on to the next one.\" \nStover said he told Rapine he liked the effort on the play, but that he could have made a smarter play and secured the ball. \nSo on the very next drive, who did Stover look for in the end zone? None other than No. 9, Rapine. Stover hit the tight end from 10 yards out to put Upper Dublin up, 14-0, early in the second quarter. \n\"He can run, he can pass, and you know that, if you're running a route, the pass is going to be dead on, right to you,\" Rapine explained. \nStover finished the evening 13 for 18 for 224 yards, with three touchdowns and one interception. \nEven Stover wasn't perfect. He threw that interception, his own mistake of the night. \nBut he sure knows how to fix a problem. \nUpper Moreland 0 0 0 7 - 7 \nUpper Dublin 7 14 7 7 - 35 \nUD: Kaleif Lee 3 run (Todd Spirt kick) \nUD: Jack Rapine 10 pass from Ryan Stover (Spirt kick) \nUD: Danny Boggs 22 pass from Stover (Spirt kick) \nUD: Sowers 10 pass from Stover (Spirt kick) \nUM: Morgan 11 run (Randy Meehl kick) \nUD: Lee 60 run (Sprit kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:56:36.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
