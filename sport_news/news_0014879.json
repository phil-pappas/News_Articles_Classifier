Veteran additions such as David Lee and Amir Johnson have claimed significant minutes in the big man rotation already, leaving Sullinger to battle Tyler Zeller and Kelly Olynyk for leftover playing time.\nBrad Stevens has made it clear he’s likely to play just four big men most nights during the regular season, and Sullinger has been the odd man out in that equation for most of the preseason. He’s played behind all four bigs regularly (when everyone has been healthy), leaving his playing time in question once the real games begin next week.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below In order to earn back his minutes, Sullinger knows he has to standout from the pack and show off his versatility. Friday night against the Sixers, we saw a bit of that ability, as the 23-year-old took the ball coast-to-coast on the fast break and finished in the paint.\nIn case you were wondering, Sullinger going coast to coast takes longer than a vine. https://t.co/6KE8F4YHzC\n— Brian Robb (@CelticsHub) October 24, 2015 The play highlighted a strong two-game stretch for Sullinger to close out an otherwise disappointing exhibition season. The 6-foot-9 forward grabbed a team-high 14 rebounds in just 20 minutes against the Sixers Friday, and he also flirted with a triple-double on Thursday night against the Knicks, posting 16 points, eight rebounds and six assists.\nWas it too little, too late for the big man to make an impact? We will find out on opening night Wednesday, when the Celtics host the Sixers at the TD Garden\nPhotos: Meet the 2015-16 Boston Celtics\n.\nPrevious -- of -- Next Isaiah Thomas, guard, four-year veteran, second season with Celtics: In 21 games with the Celtics in the 2014-15 season, Thomas averaged 19.0 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists in 26.0 minutes.
