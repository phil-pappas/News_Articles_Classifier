Love this cutie!” \nPHOTOS: ‘DWTS’ Dancing Pro Lindsay Arnold Marries Her High School Sweetheart \nWhen the cute couple officially ties the knot, it may be déjà vu for the DWTS family. Carson was a bridesmaid in fellow dancing pro Lindsay Arnold’s June nuptials to her high school sweetheart , Sam Cusick. Coincidentally, Arnold and her beau are also from Utah – they were raised 30 miles north of Carson and Mcallister in Salt Lake City. \nCarson, who is dancing with Carlos PenaVega this season, was a So You Think You Can Dance contestant before joining DWTS . She started in a troupe dance on the ABC competition show in 2013 and became one of the series’ pros last year. \nCongratulations to the happy couple! \nOne of Carson’s fellow DWTS competitors also has stars in their eyes. Bindi Irwin recently gushed to ET about having the support of her boyfriend, Chandler Powell, as she competes alongside dancing pro Derek Hough for the season 21 mirror ball trophy.
