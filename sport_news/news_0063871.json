We have spoken about the (artificial) surface - yeah, it will be different, but a lot of us have trained or even played on similar surfaces. \n\"We really just can't wait to get it going and hopefully get that 10th win and finish off in style.\" \nOnlookers will be hoping this match is more entertaining than Friday's underwhelming 2-0 defeat of Estonia. \nHowever, one major positive from the Wembley encounter was the man-of-the-match display of Ross Barkley, whose progress is impressing Toffees team-mate Jagielka. \n\"I have answered quite a lot of questions about Ross,\" he said. \"He has had a good start to the season. \n\"We have all wanted Ross to kick on and it seems like he is progressing sort of mentally and physically as a footballer at the moment. \n\"It was a fantastic performance. It was nice for him to get an assist and the general performance, but he is still the same player - he is still hungry to play. \n\"He has got a long way to go yet but it is nice that he is progressing along nicely.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:02:04.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
