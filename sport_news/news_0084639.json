Pics/AFP \n\nDefending title-holder Federer was stunned 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3 by the world number 70, who is yet to claim his first career title and has only won three matches in total at the Grand Slam tournaments.\nThe 34-year-old Swiss gave a thin smile and a wave to the crowd as he exited a shocked Qi Zhong Stadium, where he lifted the trophy last year and also won the Tennis Masters Cup in 2006 and 2007.\nRamos-Vinolas is the lowest-ranked competitor to beat the world number three in more than two years, since he lost to Argentina's 114th-listed Federico Delbonis in the Hamburg semi-finals in July 2013.\n\n\nAlbert Ramos-Vinolas seems pleasantly surprised after his win over Federer yesterday \n\"The first round here in Shanghai has always been historically quite difficult, getting used to the conditions and the surface and the balls,\" said Federer, who saved five match points against Leonardo Mayer in his opening match last year.\n\"The balls play very different than in other places. Last year I got lucky. This year I didn't. So it's a pity.\"\nFederer, who had a bye in the first round, had played Ramos-Vinolas only once before, in the first round of Wimbledon in 2012, dropping just three games in a 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 dismissal of the Spaniard.\nBut it was a very different story in the Shanghai second round yesterday as he struggled to impose himself in the first set and collapsed in the tie-breaker with a string of unforced errors.\nMy mum, dad watched nervously at home: Albert Ramos-Vinolas \nSpain's Albert Ramos-Vinolas said his father was so nervous he couldn't work and his mother was running around the house as they watched their son upend the great Roger Federer in Shanghai yesterday. In by far the biggest upset of his career, the 70th-ranked left-hander shocked the defending champion and World No 3 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-3 at the Qi Zhong Stadium, far away from the family home in Spain.\nAfterwards the 27-year-old said: \"My father was working. He stopped because he was very nervous. My mother was also at home running around the home alone. I just spoke with my girlfriend, my father, my mother, my fitness coach, my other coach who is travelling.\" Ramos-Vinolas has never won a tournament on the men's tour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:12:55.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
