So when they come onto the playground and there’s a kid that’s bigger than they are for a day, I think it probably pisses them off. And I can’t blame ’em.” — R.A. Dickey on the Kansas City Royals, Aug. 2, 2015.\nKANSAS CITY—The bat didn’t hang in the air for very long. Jose Bautista didn’t send it flipping upwards, the way Yoenis Cespedes did the other night after crushing a three-run home run for the Mets, like he was tossing it over a high fence. No, after the mammoth home run in Game 5 of the American League Division Series on Wednesday night, after the biggest, most emotional baseball play in this city since 1993, Bautista didn’t flip his bat at all. He flung it away, defiant, burning. He watched the homer sail for a second, and then he hurled the bat away. It was majestic.\nSo, of course, the Texas Rangers were upset. Baseball loves unwritten rules almost as much as hockey, and the notion of respecting the game permeates everything. The pitcher whose fastball got annihilated, Sam Dyson, put it like this:\n“Jose needs to calm that down, just kind of respect the game a little more,” Dyson told reporters per The Washington Post’s Barry Svrluga. “He’s a huge role model for the younger generation that’s coming up playing this game, and I mean, he’s doing stuff that kids do in Wiffle ball games and backyard baseball. It shouldn’t be done.”\nBaseball loves that kind of thing. Don’t show people up. Don’t be a hot dog. Be humble, in the face of a game which will humble you six to seven times out of 10. Show some class.\nPfft. As the Toronto Blue Jays prepare for Game 1 of the American League Championship series against Kansas City, the Jays are a travelling show: David Price, Marcus Stroman, Josh Donaldson, Edwin Encarnacion. But Bautista stands as the avatar for this team: its swaggering, defiant self-confidence, dashed with showmanship and emotion. He is a proud man, and thanks to the strange meltdown by defensive genius Elvis Andrus — poor guy — Bautista propelled this team to within four wins of the World Series.\nThis will be contentious. When these two teams met at the beginning of August in Toronto, Royals pitchers hit Blue Jays batters, and Jays pitchers retaliated. Royals Game 1 starter Edinson Volquez called Donaldson a baby, and the Royals believed the Jays were stealing signs. Royals pitcher Yordano Venture deleted tweets to Bautista that said, “I used to respect you, but you’re a nobody,” told him to “keep running your mouth,” and hinted at future retribution. Asked about the hit batters, Royals manager Ned Yost said, “None of them were intentional on our part. It’s part of the game. They’re as good an offensive team as you’re going to face. They have tremendous power, but they all dive to the inside of the plate which makes them susceptible to inside pitches.\n“If you continue to throw away, away, away, you’re going to get hammered. You have to throw inside.”\nThe ball Bautista sent screaming to left, of course, was inside enough to have been ball two. The biggest task the Royals face in this series is the one Dyson and the Rangers faced: Don’t let the Jays mash you. Don’t make mistakes and allow extra baserunners and let Jose Bautista hit a cathartic, emotion-drenched home run, after which he threw his bat.\nThere’s nothing baseball, whatever baseball says. Reggie Jackson watched his home runs, when they were big enough. Rickey Henderson admired them, then took wide slow turns and stutter-stepped at every base, and good luck telling him not to. (Henderson’s all-world evisceration of the 1989 Jays remains one of the all-time hot dog genius turns in baseball. How can you hold it against him?)\nBaseball is slowly embracing the bat flip, because it’s great theatre. In a game that humbles you so often, why not celebrate the moment where you conquer it back? Jose Bautista emerged from obscurity in Baltimore and Tampa Bay and Kansas City and Pittsburgh, and somehow he became a star. He compared this game’s emotions to Dominican winter ball, which reminds you of the recent Jorge Ortiz’s USA Today study of bench-clearing in baseball, and how of the 67 incidents he examined from the past five seasons, 87 per cent of the initial confrontation came from players of different ethnicities. Half of those were between Latino and white players. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?\nBautista hit that fastball with two outs of a tie game whose emotional tides were still heaving. Now Bautista and the Jays will play Kansas City and try to be the bigger dogs. If you’re good enough, you should be allowed to celebrate.\nMore on thestar.com\nRaptors’ DeMar DeRozan shrugs off slow start", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:58:22.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
