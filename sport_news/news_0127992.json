The best round ever recorded by a Badger came in 2013 when Kris Yoo shot a 65 at the NCAA Central Regional in Norman, Okla. \nFerrell then registered a 2-over 74 in the second round to put her at a 4-under 140 through 36 holes. She had a two-stroke lead in the 54-hole tournament over Notre Dame's Isabella DiLisio . COLLEGE FOOTBALL \nMichigan State defensive back Jalen Watts-Jackson was released from a hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., Monday, a day after he had surgery on a hip he injured while scoring the winning touchdown against Michigan. \nWatts-Jackson came up with a Michigan fumble on the final play of the game and returned it 38 yards to give the seventh-ranked Spartans an incredible 27-23 victory Saturday. The redshirt freshman appeared to land hard on his left hip while being tackled into the end zone by Michigan tight end Jake Butt. \nHis surgery Sunday at the University of Michigan hospital lasted more than three hours. BASEBALL \nDetroit Tigers left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris is battling cancer. \nThe 22-year-old, acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays near the July trade deadline in a deal for ace David Price , revealed the diagnosis on Instagram, saying he had known about the growth since his time with Toronto. \nNorris said he had the option to shut down his season following the diagnosis of a malignant tumor, but a doctor said he could finish the season before surgery and he chose that route. \nNorris went 3-2 with a 3.75 ERA this year in 13 starts for Toronto and Detroit. \nZito retires: Left-handed pitcher Barry Zito , who spent his entire 15 years in the big leagues with Oakland and San Francisco, announced his retirement. \nThe 37-year-old Zito, who won the 2002 AL Cy Young Award with the A's, went 165-143. SOCCER \nCarli Lloyd is among the 10 players on the shortlist for the 2015 Ballon D'Or award for the women's world player of the year after the American scored a hat trick in the World Cup final. \nLloyd, whose club team is the Houston Dash of the NWSL, was one of three U.S. players on the list, the most of any country. She's joined by Seattle Reign teammates Hope Solo and Megan Rapinoe . \nBrazil's Marta , who won the award every year from 2006-'10, did not make the list.
