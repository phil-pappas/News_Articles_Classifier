(AP) — University of South Dakota starting running back Trevor Bouma is done for the season after breaking an arm.\nBouma suffered the injury Saturday in USD's 24-21 upset of four-time defending Football Championship Subdivision champion North Dakota State, the school said. Bouma rushed 20 times for 94 yards in the game and had two receptions for 80 yards. He broke free for a 14-yard run to reach the NDSU 27-yard line shortly before the game-winning kick.\n\"Something happened on that last carry,\" Bouma said in a statement. \"I couldn't explain it to you. All I remember is that I got up and it felt weird. Something was wrong, and so I went to the sideline.\"\nCoyotes coach Joe Glenn said Tuesday that Bouma was scheduled for surgery on the broken arm — the same one he broke a year ago that cut his season five games short. He'll miss the final five games again this year.\n\"The doctor said it was just a freak thing,\" Bouma said.\nThe 5-foot-11, 210-pound junior from Le Mars, Iowa, was leading the Missouri Valley Football Conference in yards per carry and was the league's fifth-leading rusher.\nThe game also was costly for NDSU, which has lost starting quarterback Carson Wentz to a broken throwing wrist. He'll be out for the rest of the regular season. The team hasn't ruled out a possible return for Wentz should the Bison make the playoffs.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
