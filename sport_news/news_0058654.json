He's done terrifically well.\" \nVardy has not been the only pleasant surprise at the King Power Stadium. \nRanieri's summer appointment as manager following the dismissal of Nigel Pearson led many observers to predict that Leicester would struggle. \nHowever, the Italian has so far impressed in leading his team to fifth place, and Pardew has revealed his admiration for the manager and the start he has made. \n\"We're playing against a Leicester side who have been the surprise package,\" he said. \n\"I think with our signing of (Yohan) Cabaye people looked at us and perhaps thought we might have a good season, but I don't think everybody (could) see Leicester's season coming. They've done tremendously well. \n\"I'm a big fan of the manager, who carries himself really well and he's had big teams so he knows how to keep a winning run going and they're in a great zone at the moment. \n\"It's a really tough game, and a crucial game, in terms of us and Leicester because it will propel one above the other.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:17:37.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
