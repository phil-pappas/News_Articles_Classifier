Believe it", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — There are no dramatic tales to tell regarding what Jay Cutler told Bears wide receivers, whoever they are, in the huddle during two clutch fourth-quarter scoring drives in Sunday's 18-17 victory over the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.\nThat would have required Cutler and his receivers actually huddling, which the Bears quarterback strongly discouraged down the stretch.\n\"I try not to huddle, I try to keep them at the line so they're not thinking,'' Cutler said. \"That's why I'm always waving them away, 'Let's go, let's go.' Just to keep them in the moment so they can't stop and think, 'Hey, what are we doing? We've got 30 seconds left and go make a play.' ''\nFor the second straight game, Cutler executed the plays with the game on the line, this time despite having a rookie center in his first NFL start, Hroniss Grasu, and a wide receiving corps as unproven as it was unknown.\nFor the second straight Sunday, Cutler made it hard for his critics to complain and easier for coach John Fox — and dare I say Chicago? — to believe in the beleaguered quarterback whose moxie merits respect.\n\"Jay is the definition of resiliency,'' guard Matt Slauson said.\nTrailing by 11 in the fourth quarter as many of the 75,799 fans foolishly fled to the exits, Cutler threw two touchdown passes in the final 3 minutes, 5 seconds — the Bears' first two TDs on the road after 19 possessions without getting into the end zone.\nOn the first one, a 22-yard beauty to Marquess Wilson, Cutler looked off balance when he threw it, but the ball landed on the spot between two Chiefs defenders. On the game-winner, a 7-yard strike to Matt Forte with 18 seconds left, Cutler dropped the shotgun snap but recovered quickly and calmly enough to \"put the ball only where I could get it,'' Forte said.\nPraise for Cutler probably was easier to find in the locker room than in the barroom. Fox forgave Cutler's first-quarter fumble in the end zone — which Chiefs linebacker Ramik Wilson recovered for a touchdown — quicker than many watching at home did.\nWhen it comes to Cutler, our city's sports-talk radio Man of the Year annually since 2009, he remains a quarterback who lacks the special quality Super Bowl contenders seek yet possesses enough ability to keep a team from picking first in the NFL draft. Uncomfortably, Cutler resides somewhere in the middle of the pack, but the last two games should remind everyone who dismissed him out of habit that he is redeemable. He also likely will emerge as the Bears' best option in 2016 if this trend continues.\nIn 2015, progress is commending Cutler after two straight victories that had less to do with his talent than his mental and physical toughness. The Bears would be winless without Cutler, a guy still fighting a hamstring injury and whose maturation Sunday included making those around him better the way top-tier quarterbacks do. Cutler began building trust with receivers Wilson, Josh Bellamy and undrafted rookie Cameron Meredith — a trio that entered with 32 career receptions combined — by demanding more at practice. Even Cutler kidded about how much he yelled at his receivers last week.\n\"If we ran the wrong route or ran too slow, Jay would get on us — little things,'' Wilson said. \"But that showed us how much he cares. We needed that kind of thing to get the best out of us.''\nCutler's assertive approach worked. Wilson caught six passes for 85 yards and a touchdown. Bellamy came through with six receptions and Meredith added four, including two on the winning drive. Who needs Alshon Jeffery, who mysteriously missed his fourth straight game?\n\"Coaches can only go so far and at some point they get tuned out and players have to take ownership,'' said Cutler, who completed 26 of 45 for 252 yards. \"Every one of the leaders on the offense and defense are starting to take on those roles and become assistant coaches in the meeting room.''\nEvidence of Fox's coaching again was obvious for a team rocked by injuries. They were missing five Week 1 starters against the Chiefs. The training room has become such a populated place, the Bears should consider selling naming rights. But when linebacker Shea McClellin left with a knee injury in the third quarter, Christian Jones called the defense and LaRoy Reynolds — signed 13 days ago — filled in capably. An aggressive defense gave up 10 points, a solid effort even if running back Jamaal Charles departed with a knee injury and quarterback Alex Smith belongs on the NFL's all-overrated team.\nWhen linebacker Pernell McPhee blocked a 27-yard field-goal attempt to cap another disruptive day, the Bears bounced around like a confident bunch — a far cry from the 0-3 team that skulked home from Seattle.\n\"It was fun to see guys grow,'' Fox said. \"This is about playing smarter, tougher, longer than your opponent.''\nThis is about the Bears playing follow the leader.
