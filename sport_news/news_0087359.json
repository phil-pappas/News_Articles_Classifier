By Daniel Lewis , Football League CorrespondentFiled:   12:18   12:18 UK \nThe winding-up petition against the development company behind Northampton Town 's Sixfields Stadium revamp has been approved. \nBuckingham Group took legal action against County Developments Ltd over the non-payment of around £3m-worth of work carried out on the Cobblers' home. \nA court hearing was held in Birmingham on Thursday morning, seven days after a winding-up petition was initially issued by HM Revenue and Customs. \nSpeaking in the aftermath of the hearing, Buckingham Group director Tim Brown is quoted by the Northampton Chronicle as saying: \"As a contracting organisation we have put more seats in stadia than any other UK contractor. It is the first time we have ever encountered a situation such as this.\" \nBrown also claimed that Buckingham will now look to recover the money, while also considering a plan to resume work on Sixfields' East Stand.
