He is a quality player who will add real value to our squad.\" \nScott Johnson, Scottish Rugby's Director of Rugby, said: \"John has proved himself to be an excellent professional and his performances during the Rugby World Cup consolidated our belief that we would like him continuing his rugby in Scotland. \n\"This new contract means he can develop his career in Scotland and make himself available for national selection. \n\"It is also vital we continue to recruit well to develop our professional teams, so his addition to the Edinburgh Rugby squad will strengthen both his connection to rugby in the country and the team.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:13:56.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
