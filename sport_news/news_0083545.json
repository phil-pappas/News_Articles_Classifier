Buy Now Courtesy Kelly Olson \nBrady Olson had heart surgery on Dec. 31, 2013 after doctors discovered a leaky aortic valve just three days before he was supposed to report to fall football camp at the University of Mary in Bismarck, N.D. \nBOZEMAN — Cooper Olson will never forget the day his best friend had his dream taken away. \nIt was Aug. 11, 2013. Olson was sitting in a hotel room in Rochester, Minn., when he and the family received the news. \nBrady Olson, Cooper’s older brother who graduated from Westby High School that spring and signed to play college football at the University of Mary in Bismarck, N.D., would never see the field. \nDoctors had found a heart murmur earlier that summer. Second and third opinions — the final say coming from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. — determined that Brady had a leaky aortic valve that would prevent him from playing competitive sports for the rest of his life. \nThe news came three days before Brady was supposed to report to fall camp. \n“You just kind of realize that you can’t take anything for granted, that nothing’s guaranteed to you,” Cooper said. “So when you have the opportunity, you have to work as hard as possible.” \nCooper is heeding his own advice. Whether it’s school — his Montana State tuition has been waived by his high school grade-point average and ACT score — or sports, Cooper’s undeniable work ethic has helped him accomplish whatever he sets out to do. \n“My whole life I’ve wanted to be a Bobcat,” he said. “I’ve wanted to play basketball for Montana State.” \nThat opportunity began in earnest Sept. 24. \nAfter trying out for the MSU men’s basketball team six days earlier, Cooper got the call that he had made the team. He began practice Oct. 2. \n“It’s a big deal for me, too,” Brady said, beaming. “Growing up it was always our dream to play for the Bobcats or play college sports or whatever. Basketball’s really been our life since were little kids, so it was pretty exciting for me, too. \n“It’s really heartwarming to see it. Coming from what I came from and him doing what he’s doing, it’s been a journey.” • • • \nCooper’s opportunity might just be beginning, but the journey started a while back on an old basketball hoop hanging in the barn. \nThe boys played countless games of one-on-one, pushing, motivating and supporting each other to get better every day. The games were competitive, but it wasn’t a typical sibling rivalry. \n“They just always did everything together,” the boys’ mom, Shari, said. “Brady was kind of the boss. Cooper did what his big brother wanted him to. They never really had any conflict. They were pretty tight.” \nCooper credits Brady with helping put Westby on the map. Brady helped guide the newly formed Westby-Grenora co-op to the Class C 6-Man football playoffs as a senior in 2012. \nThat winter, Brady was the catalyst on a Thunder team that advanced to the Class C state basketball championship. \nA few months later, he was winning MVP honors in the 6-Man all-star football game in Custer. \n“I always knew Brady was, like, really good,” Cooper said, “but then to watch him dominate like he did, you’re like, ‘Wow. He could go places.’” • • • \nThe first indication that Brady’s future might not follow the expected course came July 18, 2013. \nA doctor in Plentywood noticed a heart irregularity and recommended Brady see a cardiologist in Bismarck, N.D. From there, he was sent to a valve specialist at Mayo. \n“They told us at the time that, no, he couldn’t play sports,” Shari said. “But they thought he had a couple years left before he would have to have the valve replaced. Less than six months later at a check-up in Billings, they said he needed to have surgery immediately.” \nAt 19 years old, Brady had open-heart surgery that New Year’s Eve to repair his aortic valve. \n“It never really hit me until afterward, after it was done,” Brady said. “They tried to explain it all to me, and I just kind of blanked out. I didn’t really want to hear it. I just had it in my mind that it wasn’t going to be that bad.” \nDuring surgery, it was also discovered that Brady needed to have his aortic root replaced. A scheduled 3½-hour surgery ended up taking more than seven. \n“It was the longest seven hours of my life, just waiting to hear if he’s all right,” Cooper said. “Seeing Brady after his heart surgery was one of the worst things ever. He looked horrible honestly and could hardly talk, couldn’t even move. You just never thought he would ever get back to normal again.” \nAnd Brady won’t. Not completely. \nHe can live a relatively normal life, but he’ll be on medication the rest of his life. He can play intramural or pick-up basketball, but he has to be careful with the physicality of sports. Handling the daily grind of college athletics is out of the question. \nBrady’s college football opportunity was taken away from him. That’s why this opportunity, as a walk-on at MSU, is so important to Cooper. \n“It’s added motivation,” he said. “Just to work as hard as I can every day and try to get out on that court eventually and represent the Olson name.” • • • \nCooper was a scrawny, wide-eyed sophomore on the Westby-Grenora team that advanced to the state championship in 2013. \n“Obviously I grew about four or five inches,” he said with a laugh. “I’m 6-(foot)-1, but I’m still scrawny now. I’m stronger than I was before. \n“But yeah, playing one-on-one with Brady, he was always bigger than me. So you kind of learn how to finish around the basket against bigger defenders. I think he really helped me.” \nBy the time he had finished his high school career, Cooper was widely recognized as one of the best players in Class C. As a do-it-all point guard, he played on three state-tournament teams, finishing second twice and third once. \nThough he was one of the best 6-Man quarterbacks in Montana and a top triple jumper, as well, basketball was and is Cooper’s passion. \nMSU coach Brian Fish started to take notice. The Bobcats’ second-year coach communicated with Cooper off and on through the summer and fall, encouraging him to attend the team’s open tryout on Sept. 18. \n“I had heard Cooper’s name, obviously,” Fish said. “I’ve got some very, very good friends in Plentywood who told me about him. I had always kind of watched him and got some tape. We invited him to try out, and it was unanimous with the staff that we would want to keep him around. He’s been a really, really good guy to have around the team.” \n“I’ll be nervous for sure,” Cooper said a few days before his first practice with the team. “But as soon as you get going, it’s just basketball. I’m doing what I love to do, so I’m just going to have a lot of fun.” \nThat's what he was doing on Oct. 2, 2015. That’s a day he’ll never forget, either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:03:11.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
