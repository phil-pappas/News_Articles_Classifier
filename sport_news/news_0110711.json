She actually wondered if there was an orchestrated \"fix\" on the game.\nShe even used the word \"fix\" in describing her concern.\nAnd Michigan State won by 26 points.\nThe official video review needs to go. While correcting and clarifying some calls, it isn't helping. It's not improving the overall quality of the product.\nEven with replay, game officiating remains interpretative at the moment of the call. What's really a catch? What's really targeting at the head? And replay can only work within the framework of that first interpretation.\nVideo review was foolishly sold as a corrective panacea. Instead, it has only made the situation worse in both college football as well as the NFL.\nIt's made referees lazier, thinking they don't need to perform their jobs better because the replay eye upstairs is there to bail them out. It's given coaches and players convenient excuses for overlooking their own accountability in not executing enough winning plays over the course of a 60-minute game. And it's made fans even more paranoid that there are sinister forces lurking in smoke-filled rooms hell-bent on deliberately making bad calls against their beloved teams.\nEnough.\nIf ignorance offered more sanity, then football's better off without video replay.\nMake the game officials full-time employees. Train them better. Push them harder. Demand more consistency. Hold them to a higher level of accountability for their mistakes.\nBut video replay isn't making their job any easier — as evidenced by the deafening cascade of boos from the Spartan Stadium crowd Saturday after some questionable calls against the Hoosiers.\nMichigan State thought it had a fourth-quarter fumble recovery when the Indiana receiver spun free, regained his balance and kept running. He wasn't down. The ball got stripped loose. Every TV replay as well as the stadium video board confirmed that. But the referee ruled that forward progress already stopped.\nThe formula hasn't changed since the first football game ever played. Teams must play through the officiating. And sometimes play above it.\nThe Big Ten does a better job than most conferences in monitoring its officiating. It has openly acknowledged errors. It publicly reprimanded the officiating crew that wrongly cost Illinois an extra down in a game earlier.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nSharp: Tired, hurt, MSU relies on resolve, Connor Cook\nAs a partner in the Collegiate Officiating Consortium, the Big Ten's attempting to create more transparency.\nIn August, the conference acknowledged that it screwed up two first-half plays in last season's Ohio State-Penn State game. An Ohio State interception counted when TV replays as well as the Beaver Stadium video board clearly showed that it should've been an incomplete pass. There was a technical snafu in the video review booth at the stadium that prevented the crew from getting every available camera angle.\nAs a result, the Big Ten promptly gave replay officials access to a mute feed of the TV broadcast as a failsafe.\nWhich begs the question: Why didn't it consider that before?\nThe officials also failed to notice that the play clock expired before the Buckeyes kicked a 49-yard field goal.\nAnd — for some reason — such situations aren't subject to video review.\nOhio State beat Penn State in double overtime. A loss in the game would've denied the Buckeyes a berth in the inaugural College Football Playoff.\nThe overall quality of officiating isn't any worse now than it was five, 10 or 20 years ago. Mistakes happen. Human error is always involved in every element of sports. But the expectation of perfection through video has only further magnified the imperfections.\nContact Drew Sharp: dsharp@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @drewsharp .
