Reinhold Matay / USA TODAY Sports FOX Sports   2:15p ET \nThere's still two weeks before the 2015-16 NBA regular season tips off, which means there's plenty of time for coach Scott Skiles to continue to put his imprint on his young Orlando Magic team. But the early results for the new-look Magic are overwhelmingly positive. \nNo one on the Magic has been more effusive in his praise for Skiles than Evan Fournier , who could be a big part of Orlando's success this season. If everything comes together for the Magic, the team could make a push for the postseason -- but it would take a big season from Fournier. \nFortunately for the Magic, Fournier told the team's official web site that he thinks Skiles' system is a nice match for his own skill set: \"I think (Skiles’ schemes) really do fit me,\" Fournier said. \"To be honest, I really love (Skiles’) toughness. The way he talks to us, the way we practice – I just love his toughness and I’m very happy to play for him.\" \nFournier is also working to make sure he fits in well with Skiles' vision for the Magic. With the ball whipping around the perimeter and off-ball movement emphasized by the coach, Fournier knows that he has to be ready to fire from the 3-point range at a moment's notice. And he told the Magic's site that he's confident in his outside shooting headed into 2015-16.
