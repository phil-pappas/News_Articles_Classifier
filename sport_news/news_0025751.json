Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: You've seen the Aggies' run defense the past couple of years vs. Arkansas. Was it better last Saturday or about the same as 2014?\nHairopoulos : Better, but still troubled. When defensive coordinator John Chavis said A&M wasn't outmanned this year against Arkansas, you had to agree. Seemed like the scheme led to some of the trouble, as much as Alex Collins and the linebackers not closing the gaps as quickly as they were asked. Will be interesting to see how the linebackers improve and if they can ever get the top guys on the field at once. Sumlin wouldn't reveal Otaro Alaka's status.\nQuestion: Do you think the Aggies are worried that Taylor Bertolet's miss at what looked to be a chip-shot winning field goal try vs. Hogs will get in his head?\nHairopoulos : Considering Bertolet's history, of course it's cause for concern to miss what would've been a game-winning FG. I was impressed that they sent him right back out for the extra point in overtime. Looked like it hooked to the right some, but he made it. But will this be on everyone's minds the next time A&M is in that situation? Absolutely.\nQuestion: Was the Arkansas nail-biter a good reminder for the Aggies that the road ahead will be tough or an indication that they may not be quite as good as their record indicates?\nHairopoulos : Both. Give credit to A&M for pulling it out when it felt like Arkansas was in control. That was a reminder of the big-time playmakers they have, ie Christian Kirk, Josh Reynolds, Myles Garrett, Kyle Allen. They changed that game fast. But, yes, it also exposed a lot of things for A&M to work on. We still have a small sample size to draw from -- win over Arizona State (which has since struggled) and big wins over Ball State and Nevada. But Arkansas played nearly the exact game it wanted to, and A&M still won.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/chats/2015/09/23/kate-hairopoulos-answers-texas-amsec-questions-3-pm-wednesday-sept-30-ask-now?hootPostID=6a3da5c44a6a9fe3981fd7def88d217c"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:41:43.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
