Because this game was about more than beating the No. 1 team in the country.\nIt was about the IU football program coming into its own.\nFor the first time in five years, there was a sell out at Memorial Stadium — meaning there were more eyeballs on IU football today than in the last half decade.\nIt would be nice, then, to see the Hoosiers put up a fight — and that’s exactly what they did.\nThrough the loss of starting running back Jordan Howard and quarterback Nate Sudfeld, the Hoosiers made it a contest down to the last second.\nBy the fourth quarter, IU had earned the attention of the nation, with the hashtag #iufb the No. 10 trending topic in the United States.\nNo more talk of “Is IU the worst undefeated team in the country?”\nIU came away with its first tally in the loss column, and more respect than it has garnered the entire season thus far.\nWith the No. 1 team as its metric, the Hoosiers proved they can play with any team in the country.\nIU outgained Ohio State 114 yards to 36 in the first quarter, even without the commanding presence of starting defensive tackle Darius Latham up front.\nAgainst the defending national champion that returned all of its talent and then some, the IU defense picked up seven tackles for loss, two sacks and two turnovers and limited early-season Heisman hopeful Braxton Miller to just two touches.\nThe performance leaves fans with one disturbing question to wrestle with: What would have happened if Sudfeld and Howard had been healthy?\nBut that is question fans must contemplate internally, with the solace that, in the words of IU Coach Kevin Wilson, the injuries to Sudfeld and Howard are just “minor deals.”\nAnd that, as Wilson indicated in his postgame press conference, this loss is merely “a stub of the toe” in the grand scheme of IU football.\nA team that at beginning of the year aspired simply to get to a bowl game — a team that was one made two-point conversion away from a 0-1 start to the season at the hands of Southern Illinois — can aspire to much more now.\nI’ll let Ohio State Coach Urban Meyer tell you what is, in my mind, a foregone conclusion for IU football.\n“That’s a team that will be going to a bowl game.”\nvziege@indiana.edu", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:46:34.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
