Related \nAccording to the league, the top five most popular jerseys belong to a quintet of young stars -- the oldest being only 28. \nChicago Cubs phenom Kris Bryant had the best-selling jersey, the league reported Monday. \nBryant, 23, is the youngest player to come in at No. 1. \nSan Francisco ace Madison Bumgarner comes in at second. The Giants pitcher is only 26. \nBumgarner's batterymate, catcher Buster Posey at age 28 is the oldest player among the top five, and his jersey is the third most popular. \nRounding out the top five is Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw (27) and 24-year-old Los Angeles Angels center fielder Mike Trout. \nJust behind Trout is likely National League MVP, Washington Nationals right fielder Bryce Harper, who is just 22. \nBoth the Cubs and New York Mets saw team merchandise sales skyrocket. The Cubs' sales were up more than 80 percent over last year, while the Mets saw 95 percent increase. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
