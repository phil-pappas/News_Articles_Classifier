Exeter is a great team, we played better than them today. We had a bunch of chances to go up two. We hit a crossbar and on another their goalie made a diving save, which I think gave them momentum. They got two fluke goals. My kids played their hearts out.” Dover’s midfield and back line made things difficult for the Blue Hawks (8-3) with strong tackles and challenges and catching Exeter offsides on 10 occasions. “Andy’s team played the offside trap and defense really well today,” Exeter coach Jim Tufts said. “They played it effectively; it took us a long time to solve it. It was the first time we have seen it, we did a nice job with it. Dover played really well. We were persistent, like we have been all year.\" Dover controlled possession at the beginning of both halves, breaking through the Exeter midfield on many occasions. The persistency paid off, as it was able to find the back of the net first. Ayalew Binette on a break found Aran Cherouvis in the low box. “Ayalew played a really good ball down the line,” Chevouris said. “I put it bottom corner. I really couldn’t do anything wrong with that pass.” Dover was able to hold Exeter back for a while, but the talented Blue Hawk squad got a throw-in from the lower right side of the pitch in the 55th minute. Sean Lavery took the throw and got it into the box, where Alle Torres dePalma was able to head it over Green Wave keeper Kieran Lombard. Less than a minute later, Exeter’s Jack Carr found a loose ball in the low box, giving Exeter a 2-1 lead. “The coach was telling me yesterday that Sean is really good at throwing it up from the corners,” dePalma said. “We were practicing it yesterday because the field isn’t as big as what we normally play on. I am happy I scored a goal.” “It was pretty much the same goal, except the ball came right down,” said Carr. “It was just a scramble in front of the net and I pushed it toward the net and luckily it went in.” The Green Wave generated many late chances, in an attempt to tie the game. In the 65th minute, it had a flurry of opportunities, including a shot blocked by Blue Hawk defender Alex Carborne. Ten minutes later it was Exeter keeper Caden Blazek’s time to shine. Binette got open in the mid-box and the keeper made the diving save through traffic. Dover also saw a Jesse Rothery header in the 78th minute go just high of the woodwork. “It is a tough result for us,” Binette said. “Our defense held up very well. The two goals were disappointing, but it was a great result for us.” Dover had 19 shots, with six on the Exeter keeper. The Blue Hawks had 21 shots, nine of them being on net. In all senses, both teams attacked and held possession for long stretches. For Dover, it feels confident it can move on quickly. “My kids are just getting more used to playing with each other,” said Allen. “Hopefully that can continue and hopefully they can wipe away this game and move to the next. If we play like this against every team, we have a chance.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:14:25.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
