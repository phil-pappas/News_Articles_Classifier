Mets take 2-1 series lead with power display \nNone adequately describes in full the seventh inning of the deciding fifth game of the ALDS between the Rangers and Blue Jays Wednesday afternoon at Rogers Centre. \nThe Blue Jays' 6-3 victory included a near-riot by the highly agitated sellout crowd of 49,742 -- an ugly scene that included a hailstorm of garbage hurled by angry fans -- a game protest, two bench-clearing incidents, three consecutive errors by the Rangers and a titanic, go-ahead three-run homer by one of the sport's most feared sluggers. \nAgain, all in the seventh inning. Baseball Chaos erupts at Rangers-Blue Jays ALDS Game 5 \nWhen the dust settled on the cauldron of emotions that boiled for 31/2 indescribable hours of postseason baseball, the Blue Jays, in the playoffs for the first time since 1993, moved on to the American League Championship Series, where they will meet the Astros or the Royals. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nTo the theater of the absurd: \nWith the score tied at 2 to start the seventh, Toronto righthander Aaron Sanchez came on in relief of Patchogue-Medford High School standout Marcus Stroman, who allowed two runs and six hits over six innings. \nRangers second baseman Rougned Odor greeted Sanchez with a single. Chris Gimenez's sacrifice bunt moved Odor to second and Josh Donaldson made a spectacular barehand play on Delino DeShields' chopper to third for the second out, which moved Odor to third. \nWith Shin-Soo Choo at the plate, Sanchez threw a 1-and-2 pitch for a ball. Catcher Russell Martin's return throw to Sanchez hit the lower part of Choo's bat, near his hand or perhaps on it, and the ball skipped away. Baseball ALDS: Rangers vs. Blue Jays \nOdor alertly ran home. \nPlate umpire and crew chief Dale Scott initially sent Odor back to third, but Rangers manager Jeff Banister argued and, after the six-man umpire crew conferred, Odor was awarded home, putting Texas ahead 3-2. \nFans immediately began throwing water bottles, cans and game programs -- among other things -- onto the field as Blue Jays manager John Gibbons came out to argue. After a discussion of over 10 minutes, and a replay review, the call stood, with the Rangers ahead 3-2. At that point Gibbons officially protested the game and more refuse rained down from the upper levels of the stadium, with several spectators appearing to get injured. \nRemarkably, the Rangers promptly committed three straight fielding errors to start the bottom of the seventh, loading the bases for the Blue Jays. Leadoff man Ben Revere failed to get the run home, grounding into a 3-2 force. Next came Donaldson, who popped a flare over second baseman Odor's head into short right. Kevin Pillar scored from third to tie the game, but Revere had to hold up and was forced at second. That was all for Cole Hamels, replaced by righthander Sam Dyson to face Jose Bautista. With the count 1-and-1, Dyson threw a 97-mph fastball Bautista annihilated to deep left-center for a three-run homer that gave the Blue Jays a 6-3 lead and brought the house down, as well as more trash from the upper deck. \nAs Edwin Encarnacion, whose homer, coupled with another dramatic bat flip, tied it at 2 in the sixth, came up, he and Dyson began yelling at each other, leading to the first benches-clearing event. After Troy Tulowitzki fouled out to end the inning, he and Chris Gimenez, the Rangers catcher, began jawing and the benches emptied again. \nTexas put two on with one out in the eighth against Sanchez, but closer Roberto Osuna struck out Josh Hamilton and Elvis Andrus to end the threat and had a 1-2-3 ninth to send the Jays to the ALCS. \nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s sports newsletter for stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:38:50.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
