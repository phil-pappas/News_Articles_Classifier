To lose Game 2, Ned? Well, yes, that could very well be a death sentence for Kansas City.\nIt’s the cruelty of October: One loss can change everything, even early in a series. And just two wins at the start of the playoffs can suddenly give you the aura of a team of destiny. How quickly things have changed for the Astros, who were fighting for their lives just a week ago. Now? The Astros look formidable: Two days after beating the Yankees at Yankee Stadium, the Astros overcame a ferocious K.C. crowd; a 47-minute rain delay that figured to derail Collin McHugh ’s start; a George Brett impersonation from Kendrys Morales (the DH became the first Royal with a multi-HR playoff game since Brett in ’85); and a brilliant relief appearance from Chris Young , to beat the AL’s best regular season team. There’s a reason why even the Royals say this Astros team—young, hungry, and fearless—reminds them of those brash K.C. kids of ’14. \n• MORE MLB: Full postseason schedule, start times, TV listings, results \nIts manager, A.J. Hinch, is pushing all the right buttons right now, as Yost seemed to do a year ago. Hinch played hobbled Carlos Gomez in the wild-card game, and the centerfielder rewarded him with a home run at Yankee Stadium. In Game 1 of the ALDS he sat Gomez for Jake Marisnick , who doubled off Yordano Ventura and scored on Jose Altuve ’s single to give Houston a 3–0 lead. After the rain delay, as Yost pulled his starter, Ventura, Hinch stuck with McHugh, who allowed just one run over four innings after returning. “We’ve got a little bit of a soft rule of about an hour or so,” Hinch said. “It was starting to get to that point.” \nFor the most part, the Astros followed the formula that made them the surprise team of 2015 and propelled them past the Yankees on Tuesday: Their starter gave them a solid outing; the homer-happy offense provided the fireworks (with George Springer homering in the fifth and Colby Rasmus in the eighth) while again striking out a ton (14 times!); the defense made plays; and the bullpen closed things out, with three scoreless innings from Tony Sipp , Will Harris , Oliver Perez and Luke Gregerson . \nA driving rain began to fall in the stadium in the second inning, as a bolt of lightning overhead sent fans beneath the overhang. After the completion of the inning, the tarp was rolled out, with nearly disastrous results , beginning the 47-minute delay. With the stoppage, Ventura’s night was over after two innings and 42 pitches. Said Yost, “We were considering bringing him back [in Game 4], and when he sat there, [pitching coach Dave Eiland] and I said O.K., 50 minutes max, for him. Forty-five for a young guy is more like our number.” \nChris Young, Ventura’s replacement, presented the Astros with a completely different look: While Ventura’s fastball is the hardest in baseball among starters—96.1-mph average, according to Fangraphs—Young averages 86.6 mph on his heater, one of the slowest fastballs in the game. Young is 6'10\", but he seems much taller on the mound. Even without the big fastball, he can be intimidating. Young struck out the first batter he faced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:52:19.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
