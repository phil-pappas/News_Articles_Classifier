New defensive coordinator Keith Butler is taking more risks with his young group and it’s paying off with more pressure in the backfield. \nSecond-year defensive end Stephon Tuitt leads the Steelers with 3½ sacks and said he’s been helped by Butler’s approach that frees him up to beat the man in front of him rather than just occupy blockers. \nAll that blitzing, however, comes with a price. Baltimore ran for 190 yards in an overtime victory last week, capitalizing whenever the Steelers got a little overzealous with their pass rush. \nDefensive end Cam Heyward says the defense is still trying to find a balance, but needs to be better on first and second down. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:02:41.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
