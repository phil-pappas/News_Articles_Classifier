But when the time came for the return gifts, it was a shocker. The gifts for the kids varied according to the status of the parents! Since Birthday Girl’s dad was a corporate honcho, the enterprising mom decided the best way to make contacts and influence seniors would be to give their kids fancier gifts than the rest. While some (gutsy) kids kicked up a ruckus, refusing to go home with the visibly smaller packets, adults, too were red faced. One wondered if relationships, too, were becoming “corporatised” in our society? Perhaps, the yardsticks employed in the corporate world of packages and profitable deals were affecting our social life — a cash-surplus, time-starved, corporate world, rewarded contacts over friends. A utilitarian approach worked, instead of cementing long-term bonds with the immediate or extended family. The idea of a global market with free exchange of goods, ideas, manpower and technology is yet to fully take root. A kinship-based society, with traditional social structures and deep-seated belief in family loyalty, is clashing with the idea of a global world. Cutting-edge competitiveness of the workplace often impacts intimate relationships. As corporate capitalism dissolves family and community and social controls, long-distance relationships and geographical dislocation, too, contribute to social friction. More disposable incomes heighten differences over spending and saving, messing up relationships between parents and children and spouses. Children usually emulate the acquisitive culture from parents, their first rolemodels. Simple pleasures do help complex lives The key ingredient in any relationship is the ability to empathise and reflect back positively to the other. A meaningful relationship requires time, patience and sharing. Is money and work taking priority over sharing and communicating? While many are able to form friendships at work and maintain meaningful personal relationships, others get lost in the long working day and barely finish tasks, let alone maintain or build relationships. Human relationships in an increasingly commercial India are based more on acquisitiveness or showing-off latest gadgets. With Diwali around the corner, gifts bought and exchanged completely surpass the rule 15-20 years back, which was to exchange pleasantries with friends and relatives. How many people after work, have a cup of tea or a short walk with a spouse/partner or catch up about their day and spend time with children? Here too, television and technology take over. As a psychiatrist, one has counselled an alienated spouse ventilating angst over a smartphone that has taken over the spouse's life. A tab/I Pad is often handed to the child, instead of narrating bed-time stories. There is conflict between parents and even arguments over the expensive gifts given to family members (especially if the woman gifts her side of the family expensive gifts from her money!). Here, the old Indian family system still comes in. Many are unable to let go because of the enmeshment typical of many Indian families. Parents, who adapt with times and learn to let go, also help their children to live independent lives. Can long-term relationships be nurtured when priorities are skewed by brands and prices? Those who manage to eschew corporate culture and take out “me time” at home to pursue simple pleasures are happier. A coffee or potluck at home or a Saturday or Sunday picnic or a cycling trip together may foster better relationships than a trip to the mall. On Sundays, couples who visit families, do voluntary work or pursue passion for music, gardening or cricket cope effectively with corporate stress. Despite corporate “package deals”, they escape the mindlessness of expensive gifts and meaningless Mall visits. — Simmi Waraich, consultant psychiatrist, Fortis Hospital, Mohali", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:22:34.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
