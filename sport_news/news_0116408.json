Sandra Dukes / USA Today Sports FOX Sports   3:44p ET \nMichigan football coach Jim Harbaugh might not like Michigan State very much, but he has a lot of respect for the men who coach the Spartan football teams and men's basketball teams. \nHarbaugh told listeners to WXYT radio in Detroit on Thursday morning he got to see the Spartans basketball team \"behind the curtain\" when his brother-in-law, Tom Crean was a graduate assistant to head coach Tom Izzo. \n\"Just the intensity of Tom Izzo, it's there all the time,\" Harbaugh said. \"Just to watch him and watch him how he interacts with the players and the coaches, I learned so much just watching him coach all game. He's always coaching. The acumen of his profession knowing basketball, coaching, epitomizes coaching to me. He's done it at the highest level for a long, long time. One of the all-time greats.\" \nAs for Mark Dantonio, Harbaugh acknowledged the Spartan football coach's reputation as the master of the trick play despite his conservative reputation. \n\"There's a lot of things to worry about, right?\" Harbaugh said. \"Mark Dantonio, he's maybe the best of all time. Fake a field goal. He'll have a special play. Seen it time and time again successfully. There's a lot of things to be on high alert for.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:04:42.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
