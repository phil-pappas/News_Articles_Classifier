The Steelers safety laid a hit on Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith during Thursday night's game that left Smith with a back injury and relegated to the sidelines. Afterwards, Smith -- who doesn't need much to set him off -- was asked about the play.\n\"For the first time in my career, I feel like I'm 36,\" he said . \"I got speared in the back by an ex-teammate and I kind of know his character and who he is.\"\nMitchell and Smith played together in Carolina in 2013.\nSmith continued: \"After he hit me, he said, 'How do you like that?' So, I mean, the best thing I can do without threatening him and saying that I will assault him when I see him is I will say I look forward to playing him again and he's on my lifetime hit list.\" \nJust watch pic.twitter.com/dCrc8aVQov \n— Glenn Younes (@gunitradio) October 2, 2015 One problem: Mitchell didn't tackle Smith on the play he got hurt. That was linebacker Lawrence Timmons and cornerback Antwon Blake.\nWhere exactly is this \"spear\" from Mike Mitchell on Steve Smith? Cant find it. Blake and Timmons made tackle on him when he hurt his back.\n— Mark Kaboly (@MarkKaboly_Trib) October 2, 2015 I saw Smith grab Mitchell facemask and not let go on a tackle. Yet to find spear.\n— Mark Kaboly (@MarkKaboly_Trib) October 2, 2015 Found Smith get in Timmons face after clean tackle. Yet to find aforementioned spear.\n— Mark Kaboly (@MarkKaboly_Trib) October 2, 2015 By the way, that's the same Antwon Blake who had to deal with the Steve Smith Death Stare earlier in the game.\nSteve Smith straight punking Blake pic.twitter.com/m6w9VaUauv \n— gifdsports (@gifdsports) October 2, 2015 To recap: Smith is angry because he got tackled and it hurt. And he decided to take out his frustrations on a former teammate who even wasn't involved in the play. Either way, the Steelers-Ravens rematch will be Dec. 27 in Baltimore. It's probably in everyone's best interest to (sorry in advance) ... ice up, son . Steve Smith wasn't happy with how a former teammate tackled him.
