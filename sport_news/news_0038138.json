Willpower and proper channeling of emotions will be the key to success in this one.\nNews and state No. 1 Canisius has won the last four meetings in the series, but the current Marauders’ senior class is expected to come into the game with extra determination as it does not want to go its entire scholastic career without at least one win over the Crusaders. The last time that happened to St. Joe’s is believed to be during the 1970s, according to coach Dennis Gilbert.\nIf the Marauders want to pad their 47-34-3 all-time edge in the series, they will need to establish the run with senior Darren Thompson. That should set up play-action for strong-armed senior quarterback Mike McCarthy. The one thing that won’t help St. Joe’s is being one-dimensional like they were during last year’s matchup, when the Crusaders yielded just 29 total yards and four first downs.\nCanisius brings a 21-game winning streak into the contest. The Crusaders’ best chance at extending it may just be to hand it off to Cole Burniston, who rushed for 179 yards and four touchdowns – most of which came during the second half – during last week’s 64-34 win at St. Francis. He kept gaining yards even after St. Francis knocked starting quarterback Tyler Stranahan out of the game with an upper-body injury. Stranahan, a senior, absorbed a hard hit into the turf while completing a pass. If Stranahan can’t go, either Dan Barnes, Steve Aichele or Jeremy Cych will get the start under center for Canisius.\nInteresting note about the rivalry: Each school has had winning streaks of at least five games three times. Canisius has two seven-game win streaks (1948-54 and 1971-77) and a five-gamer (2007-09). St. Joe’s boasts the streak – 17 straight wins (1983-98), a six-game win streak (1955-60) and a five-game win streak (2003-06).\nOther key games Saturday:\n• St. Mary’s at St. Francis, 1 p.m.: Both teams come in searching for their first league win, but the Lancers already have three league losses on their ledger.\n• Hamburg at McKinley, 1 p.m., at Riverside’s Dingboom Field: Hard to believe McKinley hasn’t won yet this season. Five-year streak of making Section VI playoffs ends, which means the Macks will try to play spoiler and prevent Hamburg from clinching a playoff spot.\n• Grand Island at Sweet Home, 2 p.m.: Both teams’ playoff hopes are slim. A win by either keeps hope alive though.\n• Williamsville East at Williamsville North, 2 p.m.: Will East keeps slim playoff hopes alive with win. Williamsville North keeps Class A North title hopes alive with win.\n#PrepTalkLive\nFrom Friday Night Lights to Saturday afternoon homecoming games, BuffaloNews.com is the place to keep track of all of Western New York’s football action.\nReview our #PrepTalkLive coverage from Friday night’s action, including photo galleries and a live blog of how the night transpired.
