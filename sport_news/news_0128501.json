Arizona State. Cal. Tennessee. Penn State. Since taking over as head coach for the 2005 season, Whittingham’s name has arisen early and often in the media, though never quicker than this. If he were any hotter he’d be in a movie trailer. \nBut flashy he’s not. \nThis is a man who thinks tucking in his shirt is dressing up. He might look uneasy with Hollywood as the backdrop, but that’s what good football coaches do — ignore the extraneous stuff. \nWhich is why Utah fans should worry, and why Whittingham is a serious consideration to replace fired Steve Sarkisian. If USC needs anything, it’s a low-maintenance guy to coach one of America’s high-profile teams. It needs a no-nonsense figure because, too much of L.A. is already nonsense. \nHand USC’s talent over to a coach without baggage and he can win national championships. Give USC a controversial coach like Lane Kiffin, or a troubled figure like Sarkisian, and it’s going to be one letdown after another. \nWhittingham will be considered until he says he’s not interested. But he could also let Utah athletics director Chris Hill sweat. Sometimes saying things like, \"I'm the coach at the University of Utah\" only means ... for the time being. \nHe got a contract extension last offseason, but not without stress. It was a poorly kept secret that going into the 2014 season he was upset he and his assistants hadn’t been offered new deals. \nIt was a tough but understandable situation for Hill. Utah was coming off back-to-back 5-7 seasons. Had he extended the contracts and Utah failed in 2014, Hill would have been excoriated. But the Utes went 9-4, winning the Las Vegas Bowl. Now they are undefeated and ranked fourth nationally. \nThe Trojans would be nuts not to inquire. Whittingham loves wearing black. What’s more L.A. than that? \nJust don’t expect to see him rollerblading in Venice anytime soon. \nWhittingham’s strengths put him up with other star considerations such as TCU ’s Gary Patterson, Arizona’s Rich Rodriguez and Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly. Whittingham is a fine recruiter of Polynesian players, which comprise more than one-fourth of his roster. That's a demographic that has been a major factor in USC's successful seasons. \nWhittingham's teams are unfailingly tough, something USC has lacked this year. He doesn’t have any apparent NCAA issues, which is particularly attractive to a program that has been hit as hard as USC. \nAlso, his personal life is in order — which isn’t the case with Sarkisian, who was fired on Monday amid reports of a pending divorce and struggles with alcohol. \nSome of the reasons Whittingham is attractive to USC are the same reasons he would like coaching there. Nearly half his Utah roster is from California, anyway. He could do his shopping and recruiting on the same trips. Whittingham traditionally gets his team to warm weather climates for bowl season and now he'd be living in one. \nMaybe the issues with Hill are history. Just as likely they're on pause. With the Utes currently making national news, this year would be as good a time as any to jump ship. Conversely, how much better does it get than what he now has? \nEither way, with an interim coach in place at USC and the season ongoing, nothing permanent is likely to happen for months. \nAfter that, Whittingham can leverage an even better deal with the Utes. \nOr perhaps he’ll put on sunglasses and turn “I Love L.A.” up on his sound system. \nThe latter isn’t out of the question. \nAs everyone in both coaching and Hollywood knows, it’s seldom good policy to turn down too many parts.
