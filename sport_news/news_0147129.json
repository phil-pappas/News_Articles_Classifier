He's a guy it's pretty hard to repeat as a goalie.\"\nWhen it comes to the number of appearances Crawford will make for the Hawks this season, he isn't even going to try to emulate the legendary Brodeur, who played in 70 or more games in a season 12 times. Crawford's career high in games played is 59 during the 2013-14 season and he has taken the net 57 times (including rare relief appearances) on three other occasions — including the '14-15 campaign.\nWith a new season approaching, Crawford — along with coach Joel Quenneville — envisions a continuation of the pattern.\n\"Ever since I've got here I've been right around 55 starts,\" Crawford said. \"I imagine it will stay somewhere around that. 'Q' likes to keep things pretty much the same. Things have been working, so what's the use of trying to overplay or try to get more and more work when maybe it's not needed? I think it's important also to see what kind of streak I'm on and how I'm playing. At the same time, you don't want Scott (Darling) to get cold or, vice versa, you don't want me to get cold. There's a fine line of how many games to play and to deal with, whether you're feeling good or seeing the puck and on a big streak.\"\nDarling's emergence as a more-than-capable backup gives the Hawks two goalies who can win games, something that's imperative in today's NHL.\n\"It's always important,\" Crawford said. \"You always want to be competitive and have someone to push you but also to have someone to give the team confidence, too, no matter who is in net. We have that here.\"\nSaid Darling: \"Watch the way the whole league is, teams that have a lot of success … have a backup goalie who can come in and contribute wins and points. Teams that have struggled maybe weren't getting the contribution from the (backup) so they had to play (the starter) 75 games, and that's a tiring year for a goalie. It definitely helps (Crawford). He knows he doesn't have to play 82 games and we're going to be OK. I'm proud they're confident enough to put me in net.\n\"As a backup, you're just always ready to go,\" Darling added. \"It's kind of our job. You treat practices like games. You never know how many games you're going to play, but I'll take any I can get.\"\nDuring his seven seasons as Hawks coach, Quenneville has never had a goaltender appear in more games than Crawford's 59 in '13-14, and he has not hesitated to go with the hot hand in the past, as evidenced by giving Darling four consecutive starts during the first round of the playoffs against the Predators last season after Crawford struggled early.\n\"You have to have two goalies in this league who can both play, both can win games and your team feels comfortable with them in the net,\" Quenneville said. \"(Darling) did a great job of getting our attention last year in camp about this time. He kept getting more as the year progressed. There might have been some uncertainty there in the past and now we're probably as comfortable as we've been with our goaltenders, 1-2, starting the season.\"\nThere is no question the roles are clear-cut — for now.\n\"I don't want to forecast too much,\" Quenneville said. \"(Crawford), you think of him in the low-60 numbers (for starts). Sixty might be all right. We like healthy competition, back-to-back games and workload and their play sometimes can change that too. We're not etched in stone as far he's going to play 60. Whether he plays 55-60, who knows? We think that healthy competition sometimes is good for everybody. But they have a good rapport with each other where it's supportive and it's being good teammates. In that area there's a lot of relying on one another and helping one another.\"\nckuc@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChrisKuc\nPrivacy Policy Ice Hockey Corey Crawford Scott Darling Chicago Blackhawks Joel Quenneville Martin Brodeur NHL", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612aa1f/turbine/ct-blackhawks-goalies-spt-1006-20151005"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:03:49.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
