(Eric Francis / Getty Images) Fred Mitchell Contact Reporter \nThe glass is half full again for the Wildcats after escaping Nebraska with a 30-28 win to improve to 6-2 (2-2 in the Big Ten) and become bowl eligible. With next weekend off, Northwestern can relax, get dressed up in Halloween costumes and prepare for Penn State on Nov. 7. Offense : (B): Clayton Thorson (13 of 28 for 177 passing yards) became more resourceful, choosing to run when pass plays broke down. His runs of 68 and 49 yards set up scores. Defense : (A): Dean Lowry (10 tackles, 2 sacks, 6 tackles for loss, 1 pass breakup), Anthony Walker (13 tackles, one TFL) and Nick VanHoose (72-yard pick-6) led the NU defense that is regaining its swagger. Safety Traveon Henry had 5 tackles, one for a 9-yard loss. Special teams : (A-minus): Jack Mitchell scored 12 points, including three field goals, and he had 4 touchbacks. Hunter Niswander had a 56-yard punt, one inside the 20. Miles Shuler ill-advisedly called for a fair catch at the Wildcats’ 4, setting up a Nebraska safety, but he had a 30-yard kickoff return. Coaching : (A): Defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz devised an effective plan to contain Huskers’ QB Tommy Armstrong and offensive coordinator Mick McCall put Thorson in better situations to make plays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:36:07.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
