Nailed it.\nPower laces and hoverboards? Sort of .\nAbolishing all lawyers and flying cars? Unfortunately not.\nBut it was the prediction in the movie that the Chicago Cubs would end over 100 years of futility and finally win their first World Series since 1908 that had baseball fans excited.\nThe New York Mets crushed that dream Wednesday night when they eliminated the Cubs from the 2015 National League Championship Series.\nGreat Scott!\nAt a special screening for the film Wednesday, star Michael J. Fox admitted on the red carpet that he was a little torn over that one.\n\"It's tough because I'm a New Yorker and I would love to see the Mets do well. But I'd love the see the film be right. So I'm torn,\" Fox said before the game ended, adding \"Whatever happens, happens.\"\nChristopher Lloyd, who played Emmett \"Doc\" Brown, said he didn't really follow the predictions, except for that one.\n\"I'm hoping the Cubs win tonight and go into the series, that would be the ultimate prediction,\" Lloyd said with a bit of trepidation.\nBut that was not to be.\nNot all is lost, Cubs fans. You can still buy the edition of USA Today printed from the movie that has the Cubs winning the series over Miami in a sweep.\nActual cover of October 23 USA Today.
