He was actually eligible to come off the list last week as players on the regular-season PUP list must sit out the first six weeks of the season at which point teams then have have a five-week window in which to allow the player to begin practicing. From the day the player begins practicing, teams have an additional 21-day window in which to decide whether to activate the player to the 53-man roster. If either of those deadlines pass, the player must remain on the PUP list for the remainder of the season. \nBengals head coach Marvin Lewis declined to reveal the plan for Burfict this week as the Bengals seek the first 7-0 start in franchise history when they play on Sunday at the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 1 p.m. kickoff (the game can be seen on Local 12). \n\"\"We've spent too much time talking about someone not on the roster,\" said Lewis \"When heâ€™s ready to come off rehab, he's ready.\" \nIt appears as if the main issue with Burfict's timetable for returning deals with his conditioning. While he moved well in Monday's workout he also labored to get through it. \n\"It's like coming into training camp,\" said defensive coordinator Paul Guenther. \"You're not going to be in football shape right away, so you can't play a whole bunch of snaps right away. We'll have to ease him into it when he gets back.\" \nGuenther said he'd obviously love to have Burfict back on the field, but he isn't sure when that will be either. \n\"There's some matchups and different things you can do with a player like that,\" said Guenther. \"He's one of our best players when he's in there. It's not different than having a top running back or top receiver. Your plan changes. Certainly when he gets back, it will be good.\" \nGuenther said the good thing is it won't take long for Burfict to pick up the defensive scheme once he does return. \n\"From an Xs and Os standpoint, I think he can pick it up in a day,\" said Guenther. \"I mean he's that smart. He knows our system inside and out. From a physical standpoint, everyone's different. I remember a couple years ago he hurt his ankle in practice on Friday or Thursday and when we were traveling to San Diego he was in a boot. He was in a boot on Saturday, and he went out on Sunday and played one of his best games as a Bengal. All guys are different. Once he gets out there, whenever he does, and he gets going, it's all going to be feel at that point.\" \nOTHER PUP PLAYERS NOT ACTIVATED; GILBERRY SITS: Neither of the other two players on the PUP list - offensive tackle Cedric Ogbuehi and linebacker Sean Porter - were activated on Monday. Both are coming off knee surgery as well. ... Defensive lineman Wallace Gilberry appeared to be the only player on the 53-man roster not participating in Monday's practice. He was bothered by a calf injury leading up to the Seattle game, but played in that game and then practiced all week leading up to the Buffalo game and played in that game as well. ... Defensive back Leon Hall , who missed the Buffalo game with a back injury, and both defensive end Michael Johnson and linebacker Vinny Rey , who left the Buffalo game with injuries, practiced. It's unclear if any of the three were full or limited participants as the Bengals were not required to file an official practice report, because it doesn't qualify as a practice leading up to the Pittsburgh game. That first practice will be held on Wednesday. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
