Staff Photo by Nick Verhagen Hannah Brautigan pushes her way towards the Summit goal. \nAt 8-2 the Mounties have developed into a very tight, well-rounded team. Through natural synergy and willingness to share spotlight, the Mounties' greatest strength lies in their offense. Led by junior midfielder Eva Kaplan (6 goals, 8 assists), the Mounties have recorded 39 goals and 32 assists and have managed to successfully spread the ball with 10 of the 18 positions players have scored goals. \nAlong with their ability to move the ball forward, the Mounties have done an equally good job on defense and keeping the ball away from their goal with senior goalie Cassandra Cardenas and sophomore goalie Anjali Abram having a combined save percentage of 79 percent. After Abram, who stepped in for a sick Cardenas in the season opener, recorded 14 saves in the 5-0 loss to Oak Knoll, Cardenas has 43 saves and has allowed only nine goals. \nThe Mounties' skills, and a little bit of luck, were put on display last Thursday when they defeated Summit 3-1 with goals coming from sophomore forward Missy Wrede and senior forward Hannah Brautigan. \n\"We went into today with the right energy,\" Brautigan said. \"My teammates did a good job setting up really nice opportunities. It helped prove ourselves and prove that we're not just here to play easy teams and get easy wins.\" \nAs it has been all season, speed and passing were what Montclair focused on the most against a strong Summit team while they tried to shutdown senior forward Sophie Pollinger who has plagued teams by scoring 20 goals. Montclair successfully held Pollinger to only one assist that came when the ball found its way past the sticks of several Montclair and Summit players before senior forward Brooke Daney tapped it in with just over seven minutes left in the game. Despite the unlucky bounce during the late goal, the Mounties also saw two extremely lucky bounces that were both an inch away from finding the back of the goal. Narrowly missing the corner of the goal, both shots hit the post and ricocheted toward the sideline, allowing the Mounties to compose themselves and get into position. \n\"Summit's a good team,\" said head coach Mary Pat Mercuro. \"The win against Summit is very encouraging. Summit had a hard time moving the ball and the girls played together. It was good field hockey.\" \nIt was also announced last week that Montclair is officially the number two seed in this year's Essex County Tournament. With an automatic bye into the semifinals, on Saturday, Oct. 10, the Mounties will play either Millburn or Glen Ridge, who played on Wednesday, Oct. 6 after the Times went to press. \nMercuro said that she is happy with the seeding and hopes that they get a chance to play West Essex again, noting that, when they lost 6-0, West Essex didn't get Montclair at their best. \n\"There are no excuses but we can definitely give them a better game,\" Mercuro said. \nMounties shut out chatham \nThe Mounties put on shooting clinic in their game against Chatham on Tuesday, Oct. 6 when they took 19 shots on goal. Give credit to Chatham goalie Emily Buckman who saved 17 of them but even that wasn't enough to stop the Mounties who won 2-0 thanks to goals from juniors Marley Schwartz and Natalie Rechan. Rechan and senior Isabella Guaval each recorded an assist on the day. Montclair did an excellent job shutting down Chatham, allowing only three shots on goal. The Mounties travel to Millburn today, Oct. 8 for their game at 4 p.m. \nEmail: verhagen@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:19:19.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
