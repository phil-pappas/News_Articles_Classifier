(Image Source: Christian Peterson/Getty Images) \nHere’s a look at the Monday Night Football matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and the Arizona Cardinals: \nSeries: Ravens Lead 4-1; Streaks: Ravens won past 4; Last Meeting: Ravens 30, Cardinals 27 (10.30.11) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: ESPN (Mike Tirico, Jon Gruden & Lisa Salters) \nSpread: Cardinals -9; O/U 49 ½ \nInjury Report: Ravens: Out: S Terrence Brooks (thumb), WR Breshad Perriman (knee), TE Maxx Williams (knee, ankle); Questionable: CB Asa Jackson (thigh), FS Kendrick Lewis (knee), CB Lardarius Webb (thigh); Probable : CL Chris Canty (calf), OLB Elvis Dumervil (non-injury related), ILB Daryl Smith (non-injury related), WR Darren Waller (concussion), OG/OT Marshal Yanda (ankle) \nCardinals : Out: TE Darren Fells (shoulder), OLB Alex Okafor (calf); Questionable: WR John Brown (hamstring); Probable: CB Justin Bethel (foot), WR Larry Fitzgerald (non-injury related), WR Brittan Golden (groin), DT Cory Redding (shoulder), DT Frostee Rucker (foot), OLB LaMarr Woodley \nWhere They Stand: The Arizona Cardinals are coming off their second loss of the season, but at 4-2 remain a full game in first place in the NFC West heading into tonight. Despite two losses and the fact that there are five 6-0 teams in the NFL, Arizona leads the league with their plus-88 point differential. While the Cards appear to be the class of their division, the Baltimore Ravens reside in last place in the AFC North and look to avoid becoming the first six-loss team in the conference. Somehow there are seven teams in the AFC that have worse point differentials than Baltimore’s minus-19. \nThe Ravens: QB Joe Flacco likes playing under bright lights, with a 4-1 record, 1,136 passing yards, six TDs (1 INT) and a 93.5 rating in his past five on Monday Night Football. From his days in the NFC, WR Steve Smith Sr. has 54 receptions for 866 yards and eight scores in nine starts against Arizona with four 100-yard games. With one grab he can pass Andre Reed for 15 th all-time. RB Justin Forsett has produced 100-plus scrimmage yards in his past three games and he went off for 182 yards and two scores in his only career start on MNF. ILB Daryl Smith leads Baltimore with 55 tackles, including nine last week with a sack. He’s one of five Ravens with multiple sacks this season, led by DE Lawrence Guy (3 sacks). OLB Elvis Dumervil has 2.5 sacks this season and four in his past three on MNF. When healthy, Jimmy Smith (2 INTs, 4 PDs) and Lardarius Webb (5 PDs) form one of the best corner duos in the NFL. \nThe Cardinals: When QB Carson Palmer starts the Cardinals have been as good as anyone in the NFL, 17-4 in his past 21 starts. At his disposal, Palmer (1,737 yards, 14 TDs, 5 INTs) has a blend of crafty experience and speedy youth to throw to. WR Larry Fitzgerald has caught a pass in 176-straight games and his 104 TD receptions since he was drafted in 2004 are the most in the league. Second-year WR John Brown is a big-play threat coming off a career day with 10 catches for 196 yards last week. RB Chris Johnson (4.8 YPC) leads the Birds in rushing and has gone over 100 yards in four of his past six games on MNF. RB Andre Ellington likes playing against the AFC with 358 yards from scrimmage in his past three inter-conference games. A third RB, rookie David Johnson , leads all rookies with six TDs (3 rushing, 2 receiving, 1 kick return). The Cardinals defense is a ball-hawking bunch coming in with an NFL-best 11 INTs. CB Patrick Peterson (2), as well as S’s Rashad Johnson (3) and Tyrann Mathieu (2) all have multiple picks this season. Peterson is the only player with 15-plus INTs (17) and at least five return TDs (5) since 2011 and only Johnson has had multiple INT games in the past three seasons. S Deone Bucannon doesn’t have a pick but leads the team with 42 tackles, as six of their top eight solo tacklers are DB’s. \nPrediction: The Cardinals are going to win this game…the only question is by how much? Their four wins have come by a total of 102 points (average margin of 25.5), while Baltimore’s five losses have come by a grand total of 22 points (average margin of 4.4). The Ravens’ season is over but this is Monday Night Football, they are going to bring it tonight, so don’t be surprised if they manage to keep this one close, just like their first-five losses. \nScore: Cards 27, Ravens 23 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
