Century's Julia Hatmaker and Hanah Warther celebrate a goal against Manchester Valley. (KEN KOONS/STAFF PHOTO / Baltimore Sun Media Group) Jake Rill Contact Reporter Carroll County Times After tying each of the past two years, Century girls soccer cruised past Manchester Valley on Thursday \nHannah Warther started the game by scoring just five minutes in, leading a flurry of three Century goals in the opening 10 minutes, and setting the tone early as the Knights cruised against their biggest county competition. \nBut as the seconds ticked away in Century's 3-1 win over the visiting Mavericks on Thursday, Warther, the county's leading scorer, went down in pain. \nThe Knights senior forward went down inside the box, getting tangled with the ball and a MV defender, and laid on the ground, yelling loud enough to hear from the Century bleachers. Warther walked off under her own power, but was still visibly upset over the discomfort in her right knee after the game ended. \n\"We have some girls injured and some bumps and bruises,\" Knights coach Sara Figuly said. \"We don't want anyone else going out.\" \nInjuries have plagued both of the county's top two teams. Century is without junior forward Kylie Davis (broken collarbone) and Manchester Valley has missed Lizzie Colson (left foot), last year's leading scorer in the county and the reigning Times Player of the Year, for the last six games. \nIt's uncertain how severe Warther's injury is or if she will miss any time. But it would certainly be a blow for the Knights (9-1, 3-0 county) â€” Warther leads Carroll with 31 points. \nShe reached that total with a pair of goals early against the Mavs. Keri Mathias set up Warther's first goal in front of the net with a perfect pass. Warther needed to beat just Mavs goalie Ali Johnston to beat, and she did, booting it past for a 1-0 lead. \nLess than three minutes later, the Knights made a long pass down the field, avoided an offsides penalty, and had three strikers get past the back line of Mavericks' defenders. Megan Callan hauled it in, dribbled down the field for about 15 yards, and scored for a quick 2-0 lead. \n\"We just knew that we needed to come out with intensity,\" Callan said. \"We just wanted to come out and give everything we had.\" \nWith more than 30 minutes remaining in the first half, Warther found the back of the net again, scoring a nice unassisted goal from close range. \nThe Knights shared the county championship with Manchester Valley last season, after the two teams both went 6-0-1 in the county and tying each other 3-3. In fact, the two teams had tied two years in a row. \nManchester Valley had been getting large scoring contributions from Rayna Deltuva, Demi Askew, and Mackenzie DeWees, among others. \nBut against the Knights' strong defense in their third game in as many days, the Mavericks couldn't create the scoring chances they so often do. DeWees had the lone goal for MV (8-2, 3-2), scoring on a penalty kick with 4:40 until halftime. \n\"We could've been 100 percent, Century's a great team and we all know that,\" Mavs coach Joe Miller said. \"They looked sharp, they just ran by us the first three goals. We looked a little tentative and play tentative against a good team, they're going to burn you.\" \nThe Knights are the only team with an unblemished county record, but they still have five more games against Carroll opponents remaining. However, even if Century wins the Hersh Division, it will have to play the winner of the Cowan Division, which is currently Manchester Valley, in the county championship game later this month. \n\"There's been a lot of wins and losses in the county that were unexpected so you never know what's going to happen,\" Callan said. \"You've just always got to be on top of your game and play hard and never let up.\" \nGoals: MV-Mackenzie DeWees; C-Hannah Warther 2, Megan Callan. \nAssists: MV-none; C-Keri Mathias. \nSaves: MV-5 (Ali Johnston); C-2 (Cari Rusk). \nHalftime: Century, 3-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:38:26.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
