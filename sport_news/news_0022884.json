If you are playing aggressively against leg spinners maybe you can get runs but there's also the chance of getting out.\" \nWhen asked who among coach Trevor Bayliss' side could hit back best, Mahmood said: \"Joe Root is playing well, and he's been phenomenal with his bat, and he is doing really well. \n\"Jos Buttler, I have seen him, Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, Cook - they have such a good side.\" \nPakistan's hopes of repeating the whitewash from three years ago took a back step when Yasir was ruled out of the first Test after suffering a back spasm during training earlier this week. \nShould he recover in time for the second five-dayer, which starts on October 22 in Dubai, England will face the kind of leg spin as Yasir has become the fastest Pakistani to reach 50 Test wickets. \nIn October last year, Australia great Shane Warne hailed Yasir as \"the best young leg spinner\", and Mahmood was in agreement, saying: \"Definitely he's a game changer. Throughout the World Cup I was saying he's a match-winner. \n\"He's young, but if Shane Warne can see the talent in him?there is a similarity. He has the potential. If he has the right captain, like Misbah-ul-Haq, so he handle him really well, that's why he can perform well. \n\"I hope he's the next Shane Warne for Pakistan.\" \nMeanwhile, England's status for the series of second-favourites will be hanging over their heads until at least a Test win has been secured. \nHowever, Pakistan too cannot afford to take things lightly despite being unbeaten in their 'home venue' of the UAE according to Mahmood, who said: \"It will be a tough series for both of them. It's not going to be easy. \n\"People were saying Pakistan will do 3-0? If you see both sides, I think England are on a better position right now, not just for this series but also for the future. \n\"They have a lot of young players, playing positive cricket. It's what you need. \n\"Its always the case that history can be made. Cricket is a funny game. \n\"Pakistan have to play good cricket. If England have to beat them they have to play really, really good cricket.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:06:44.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
