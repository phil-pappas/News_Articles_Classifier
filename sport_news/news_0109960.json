When it was bad, well, this all started to look like one horrendous mistake.\nThe Islanders made their regular-season debut as tenants of Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on Friday night, and they turned around what was looked like a dud of a performance into an entertaining game — even if it ended in a 3-2 overtime loss to the defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks.\nPatrick Kane, the Chicago sniper under investigation for sexual abuse, finished it off with a power-play goal in the extra period, a deflection getting by Isles backup goalie Thomas Greiss. It was Kane’s second of the night.\nFollowing the first 43 years of the Islanders’ existence being spent as residents of suburban Nassau Coliseum out on Long Island, the change in environment seemed to hit the fans like a jolt. The game started with overwhelming disdain being voiced for the move. But as the Islanders started to play better, it was clear that the fans’ passion has moved westward — even if it moved with an edge, and one that doesn’t seem to love change.\n“I just want to compete and execute,” coach Jack Capuano had said before the game. “Everything else will take care of itself.”\nThe Islanders were obviously rusty in the first game of the season, but they did manage to tie it, 2-2, at 1:18 of the third, igniting the crowd for the rest of the night. The tying goal came when new defenseman Marek Zidlicky took a long slap shot, founding its way through a Mikhail Grabovski screen and passed goalie Corey Crawford.\nThe first real burst of excitement didn’t come until 5:22 into the second period, when Johnny Boychuk made a great pass to captain John Tavares, somehow left alone in front. After Chicago goalie Corey Crawford stopped the first shot, Tavares got his own rebound and scored the first Islanders goal that counted in Brooklyn.\n“Like every season, we’re all excited,” Tavares said on Thursday. “It’s finally here. It’s been a long time thinking about it.”\nBefore the game, there was a small ceremony on the ice, with Islanders legends Bryan Trottier, Mike Bossy, Bobby Nystrom and Billy Smith all in attendance. Also on the ice for the ceremonial puck drop was owner Charles Wang, as well as the two men who will be majority owners after this season, Jonathan Ledecky and Scott Malkin.\nWhen the actual play started, there wasn’t a ton of jump from either team, with offsides in abundance. Kane, the Blackhawks star being investigated for sexual assault near his home in Buffalo, had a great backhanded chance, but was thwarted by Greiss. Soon after that, the fans began chanting “No means no!” and did so often when Kane was near at the action.\nBut just over halfway through the first period, the Isles were on the power play and young forward Brock Nelson made a careless play with the puck in the neutral zone, turning it over for an Artem Anisimov shorthanded breakaway. The former Ranger netted a high backhand and allowed the Blackhawks to take a 1-0 lead into the second period.\n“It’s obviously a big game being the first game here, but the same time, we’re playing hockey, and just have to go out there and do what everyone in here gets paid to do,” Nelson said before the game, as the 23-year-old signed a three-year, $7 million deal on the eve of training camp. “Just play the game not put any more of that outside pressure.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under barclays center ,  chicago blackhawks ,  new york islanders ,  patrick kane", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:46:06.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
