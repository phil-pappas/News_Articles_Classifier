(AP Photo/Tim Ireland) By The Associated Press The Associated Press \nThe latest from NFL games around the league on the seventh Sunday of the season (all times EDT): \n12:10 p.m. \nThe top wide receiver active for the Chiefs on Sunday against Pittsburgh has eight receptions all season. \nGood luck with that, Alex Smith. \nJeremy Maclin passed the league's concussion protocol after getting hurt last week in Minnesota, and he practiced Friday. But the Chiefs' leading receiver was inactive against the Steelers, which means Smith won't have the biggest weapon left in Kansas City's popgun offense on the field with him. Jamaal Charles is already out for the season with a knee injury. \nRunning back-turned wide receiver De'Anthony Thomas has just eight receptions this season, making him the Chiefs' top pass-catcher aside from tight end Travis Kelce. Jason Avant and Chris Conley, who is starting in Maclin's place, have just seven receptions apiece. \nAt least Smith and the Chiefs have this going for them: Pittsburgh's pass defense is allowing more than 280 yards per game, 26th-best in the league. \n___ \n11:41 a.m. \nKeep Adrian Peterson in your lineups. \nThe Minnesota Vikings star running back is active Sunday at Detroit, a day after being downgraded to questionable with an illness. \nPeterson had 134 yards rushing and 29 carries, both season highs, last month at home against Lions. In his first 13 games against the Lions, Peterson ran for 100-plus yards eight times and scored 11 touchdowns on the ground. \n— Larry Lage reporting from Detroit \n___ \n9:30 a.m. \nKevin Harlan and Rich Gannon typically call games for CBS, but on this particular football Sunday, their microphones say \"NFL on Yahoo.\" \nThe league is experimenting with streaming the matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars from London. With kickoff at 9:30 a.m. EDT, it is available only through Yahoo outside of the teams' home cities, not just within the United States but around the world. \nThe NFL wants to figure out whether there's significant money to be made in distributing games \"over the top\" — streaming them directly to fans. Yahoo and other tech companies such as Google and Apple could be future partners in how the league broadcasts the sport, to go along with its traditional deals with the television networks. \nViewers in Buffalo and Jacksonville are able to watch Sunday on their local CBS stations. Everywhere else, anyone with an Internet connection can see the game for free. The stream is available on any device through various Yahoo properties, including Tumblr, and the NFL's website and app. \nFans are still able to watch on their televisions if they own connected devices or sets. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:12:36.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
