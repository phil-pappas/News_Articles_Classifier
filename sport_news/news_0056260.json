(AP) -- Om won the $200,000 Twilight Derby by 2 1/4 lengths Saturday at Santa Anita.\nRidden by Gary Stevens, Om ran 1 1/8 miles on turf in 1:45.90 and paid $3, $2.40 and $2.20 as the 1-2 favorite.\nIreland-bred Mister Brightside returned $6.40 and $4.40 in his U.S. debut for his owner, retired rider Walter Swinburn.\nRoyal Albert Hall was another half-length back in third and paid $3.40 to show.\nThe victory, worth $120,000, increased Om's career earnings to $394,500, with four wins in eight starts.\nIt was an emotional victory for Om's owner, the Sareen Family Trust. U.S. Marine Major Taj Sareen, the son of K.B. Sareen, was killed this week when his FA-18 fighter jet crashed shortly after takeoff from a British air base.\nSports & Recreation Royal Albert Hall   39010/73864   2834/4545   8425/11364  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:03:48.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
