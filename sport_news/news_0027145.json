After word broke late last week that a prostitute wrote a book that could bring down the UofL basketball program, the Bluegrass has been anxiously awaiting any little piece of news on the story. Everyone, red and blue, is tuned in to see how this ends. One side dreading a potentially disastrous outcome, while the other watches its archrival suffer, hoping for the absolute worst. \nMe, I’m enjoying the hell out of it. Can’t thank the universe enough for wrapping this gift and delivering it to my doorstep last Friday. Like everyone else, I’m devouring handfuls of popcorn with all eyes glued to the situation, rooting for Louisville’s demise. But as I wait for it all to play out, I have so many questions about the whole thing. I’m throwing them all out there tonight… \n\nYou’re a star basketball player. Why hookers? \nAnyone playing basketball at the University of Louisville should have no trouble getting laid on any given night. That goes for everyone on the team; not just the star players. Walk-ons get boy band ass when they’re a member of a top 10 basketball program. There are jersey chasers everywhere and they’re very good at doing just that: chasing jerseys. The whole point of their existence is they come to you, hence the “chase.” Minimal effort to get them home for a night. It’s a great deal for athletes. It’s unfair to the rest of us, really. \nBut for some reason, the Louisville boys wanted paid help. Showing up at the nearest house party is just too much work, I guess. They had to hit the ATM and call in the professionals. I don’t understand it. It’s completely free and legal 20 steps out their front door on campus. \nWhy at the dorms? \nSo let’s say nightwalkers are your thing. Maybe you prefer a seasoned vet in the sack and the way she smells like USA Gold menthols, knockoff Dolce & Gabbana perfume, and week-old Long John Silver’s. It’s not my style, but who am I to judge someone else’s tastes in women? The heart wants what it wants. I get it. No judgment here. Do you. \nBut why take them to the dorms? Hookers, bless their hearts, traditionally perform their craft in half-star motels and dark alleys. (So I’ve heard.) You don’t take them out of their element and into a new arena. Not only are they fish out of water; in this case, they took pictures and kept a journal and now it’s all over the place. \nYou know where they wouldn’t have taken pictures? Red Carpet Inn. You know where there’s no evidence anything went down? Red Carpet Inn. Not the UofL basketball dorms. \nBut isn’t that what you paid them to do? \nSounds to me like a real waste of money. You had one job! \nWhat kind of a sick human being pimps out her own teenage daughters? \nWhile I find humor in 99. percent of this whole scandal, the mother-daughter prostitution ring is terribly sad. \nIf you want to sell your body for money, by all means, do as you please. God gave it to you and if you want to share it with the world to pay this month’s cable bill, that’s your prerogative. But to pull your own daughters into that lifestyle and encourage them to do the same? Disgusting. Sickening. Hell isn’t hot enough for you. \nWas anyone surprised to see Chane Behanan’s name in the mix? \nChane, man. That guy can’t stay out of the news. Mr. Violation Of Team Rules himself played a major role in these allegations, to no one’s surprise. Almost two years removed from his dismissal from Louisville and he’s still a cancer to Rick Pitino and the program. \nAnd to think, he almost ended up at Kentucky. \nIs Tom Jurich suffering from dementia? \nIn his Friday evening press conference, Jurish uttered the words, “Coach Pitino has a perfect track record.” \nSelective memory much? \nWhere did Andre McGee get the money? \nThe allegations date back to McGee’s time as a graduate assistant, a position that does not pay well. So unless he was the unanimous Team Player of the Year, or had a part-time job on the side, how did he fund these parties? \nI love my friends, but I’m not buying them hookers. Not on more than one occasion, at least. \nWhen will this stop being funny? \n— Drew Franklin (@DrewFranklinKSR) October 2, 2015 \nDid Rick Pitino know it was happening? \nAh, the million dollar question: Did Rick Pitino know? \nThe madam says yes, Pitino knew. She claims Andre McGee told her, “Rick knows about everything.” \nBut as scandalous as Rick is — and he is very scandalous — I have a hard time believing he would’ve let this go on where it did. My guess is, at worst, he knew to a certain extent and turned his head. I can’t imagine he played any role in it or allowed it to happen. \nWill the 2013 title banner come down? \nUnlikely. \nBut U of L fans will never, ever, ever, ever, ever hear the end of it if it does.

CW October 5, 2015 at 8:50 pm | Permalink \nMaybe if they didn’t try to say Calipari is a dirty head coach or that he pays our recruits whenever UK basketball is brought up to them, then maybe. But until then, this can be karma for them telling us the past 6 years that UK would get riddled with sanctions by the NCAA when, in fact, they are the ones facing sanctions now. jeffj October 5, 2015 at 8:20 pm | Permalink | Reply \ndag gone drew !! you nailed this to the wall !! can’t wait to see “duh -vile’s” 1st “practice’ UKinIN October 5, 2015 at 8:29 pm | Permalink | Reply \nNot defending anything ever about U of L but a madame saying that McGee said “Pitino knows everything” is not the same as Pitino knowing. It wouldn’t stand up in court and Jurich would never fire Pitino on that kind of evidence. What I’m waiting for is for Pitino to take responsibility for HIS program and Jurich’s tap dancing as he explains that Rick isn’t going anywhere. leon singleton October 5, 2015 at 8:29 pm | Permalink | Reply \nWill Pinto’s tattoo come off. calipeari October 5, 2015 at 8:30 pm | Permalink | Reply \ndom hawkins broke his hand in practice today, out at least 4 weeks Questioning Glare October 5, 2015 at 8:38 pm | Permalink \nSource?

People who can get laid whenever they want only go to hookers because they’re supposed to be “professionals” with discretion. In this day of social media and everyone having a platform though, it’s hard out there on a pimp.

Guess you’d have to ask the NBA and NFL players. They have unpaid groupies too. Harry October 5, 2015 at 8:56 pm | Permalink | Reply \nNo evidence of any decency here. I think it’s pathetic myself, pathetic that it happened and pathetic that it’s being celebrated. seefus October 5, 2015 at 9:01 pm | Permalink \ni’m just thankful it didn’t come out at christmas time—i might have died with glee. Ironic October 5, 2015 at 9:19 pm | Permalink \nI don’t think UK fans are celebrating that it happened, at least not as much as some of the recruits dad’s were allegedly celebrating it. We just like seeing the fans eat their own words when all we’ve heard is how much our program cheats. I do enjoy seeing karma go full circle. No wait, the dads were involved……I don’t feel bad celebrating their demise if their own parents were in on it. I’m gonna make a L1Cwhore cake and invite all the neighbors over. We gonna celebrate Shelby October 5, 2015 at 9:22 pm | Permalink | Reply \nThis isn’t a “party or two” folks, it’s several encounters between recruits, players, and prostitutes…of course pitino AND jurich knew. Wink, nod, and look the other way. This is the same athletic director who had the colossal gall to rehire Petrino–the biggest piece of trash in the college football coaching world. I need no further proof that winning, regardless of the methodology, comes first to jurich. No way in hell is this all andre mcgee’s doing–it was funded; mcgee didn’t make enough money to pay for this. TheDude33 October 5, 2015 at 9:53 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI hate Louisville more than anything but Pitino was doing this crap at UK back in the 90’s. I was there from 94-98 and had talked to 2 profs that said that they had been asked by the Athletics Dept to give kids grades (Antione Walker). They didn’t want to but had tremendous pressure to do so. I know what Louisville has done is bad but Pitino knew all about back then. He knows about it now. So I’m not surprised at all. lonnieb October 5, 2015 at 10:27 pm | Permalink \nI’m sure a random professor told YOU a student at uk that he gave grades to basketball players because of pressure. You can say you had classes with the players and they didn’t show up all the time and didn’t know which way was up…….but that professor didn’t risk his teaching credentials by telling another student he gave grades to the ball players U no October 5, 2015 at 10:56 pm | Permalink \nHahaha this is ridiculous. He’s gonna just volunteer this info to a student. Um ok……if it sounds like a card fan and lies like a card fan……well you’re a card fan aren’t ya. Sorry bout your programs impending demise but don’t try to bring us down. We celebrating yo Jaw October 5, 2015 at 9:55 pm | Permalink | Reply \nHow is this whole thing good for BBN except for spite?

TheDude33 October 5, 2015 at 9:56 pm | Permalink | Reply \nAlso, if the media had the resources it has today back then Pitino woulda been busted back then. Katmomama October 5, 2015 at 10:13 pm | Permalink | Reply \nThe real victims of this story are the recruits. If my 17-yr-old son went to an official college visit and was treated to hookers I would be opening a giant can of whoop-ass on that coach! There is no way the coaches didn’t know this. I think not only Petino, but Jurich and the entire bunch needs to go. But they have a president under investigation, so there isn’t much of a moral compass to lead. Just Say'n October 5, 2015 at 10:41 pm | Permalink | Reply \nUpdate: My brother just informed me that in the book the madame says that one of the reasons she got upset with McGee was that he wanted her to get him some white women and that @issed her off. I doubt you’ll see that in the papers anywhere. Especially in ‘metro’ loserville.
