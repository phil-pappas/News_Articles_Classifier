The scheme promised Rs 3,000 honorarium to the guest doctors everyday for practising in the hill districts. The doctors opting to serve had an option to select the district they want to practise in. Also, the their boarding, lodging and travel needs were to be taken care of by the government. However, after conceptualising the scheme, the state Department of Health failed to publicise it and as a result, the scheme could not elicit any response. “The nodal officer was appointed a month back to publicise the scheme and attract doctors from other states. But it could not be done when the char dham yatra took off. We could have attracted considerable doctors during that period. A month’s exercise has yielded just two doctors,” said Dr RP Bhatt, DG Health. While two doctors hailing from other states have responded, it is not clear when the government will sign an agreement with them. Meanwhile, the department is also contemplating starting tie-ups with charitable trusts rather than individual doctors. But, for all this to take place, the government has to first work out a water-tight contract with the individuals and charitable institutions concerned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:14:15.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
