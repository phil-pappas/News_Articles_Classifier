They started off the game strong behind big gains by junior Joshua Petty and Turner. \nA big 24-yard pass from Lacy to senior Andrew Ennis put the Indians at the 1 and Petty took it in the end zone on the next play to put the Indians on the board after taking off 7:08 off the game clock. \nEast Limestone recovered the kickoff and continued to use the run game to punish West Point up front as Lacy and Petty gained big chunks of yardage and the latter finished the drive off with a 7-yard score to put the Indians up 14-0. \nWest Point (4-4, 3-3) would capitalize when they started a 15-play drive from the 33-yard line as Smith gained 59 yards on the ground, including a 6-yard score to cut the deficit to 14-7 with 7:53 remaining in the half. The Indians took over at their 20 yard line and a 74-yard run by Petty quickly put them in business at the 6-yard line. \nJevonte Alexander then punched it in from a yard out to put East Limestone up 21-7 with 4:59 remaining in the first half. \nThe comeback started for West Point when they recovered an Indian fumble and Tristin Skinner nailed a 36-yard field goal to pull the Warriors within 21-10 at the half. \nWest Point got a great kickoff return from Kobe Smith to start the second half as he returned it to the 46-yard line. He helped engineer a 12-play drive that took 5:41 off the clock and he ended it with a 2 yard tote to cut the lead to 21-18 with 6:59 left in the third quarter. After forcing another Indian fumble and a punt on their next two possessions, West Point took the lead for the first with 9:21 remaining in the game. \nAfter both defenses forced a punt after the Warrior comeback, junior Khristian Thompson picked off a Lacy pass at the 46 yard line. After getting two big first downs behind runs by Smith and Moore, the Indians defense shut down Smith on a 4th-and-12 to regain possession with less than a minute to play. \nPinned deep in their own territory, Lacy completed his pass to Turner, who used his speed to outrun the Warrior defense and give East a 28-25 lead with 13.9 seconds left in the game. \nEast Limestone (6-2, 5-1) got a huge game on the ground from Petty, who finished with 121 yards on 15 carries and 2 touchdowns. Lacy finished the game completing 2 of 3 pass attempts for 89 yards. \nWest Point got another big game from Smith. He finished with 181 yards on 41 carries and 2 scores. \nEast Limestone (6-2, 5-1) hosts Ardmore for its final region game of the season next Friday while West Point travels to Lawrence County for a game that will decide the final playoff spot in 5A Region 8.
