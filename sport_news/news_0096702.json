ACC is in the West Division, Guerin is in the East.\n\"We did reach out to the officials who worked the game (Sept. 19 at Guerin) to get more details,\" Anderson said. \"At this point, I think it would be best if (the schools) work out some sort of agreement. It's best when the school administrators take care of things like this.\"\nAnderson, who oversees football for the IHSA, said he couldn't think of a similar situation in his six years with the IHSA.\n\"Generally, coaches tend to get along,\" he said.\n\"Typically, if something comes up, it's usually a coach having a disagreement with an official or officiating crew. If a coach is ejected from a game, he has to sit out the next contest, or more if he's totally out of line.\n\"That's generally where we have disagreements. It's rare to have the two sidelines have a disagreement that develops into a confrontation.\"\nrarmstrong@tribune.com\nTwitter @RickArmstrong28\nCopyright © 2015, Aurora Beacon-News College Sports Illinois High School Association Aurora Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5605eee0/turbine/ct-lns-jeff-bonato-column-st-0926-20150925", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c6655/turbine/ct-abn-football-aurora-central-catholic-st-1001-20150930"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:59:35.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
