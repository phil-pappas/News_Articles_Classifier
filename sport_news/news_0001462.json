Fortunately, there are a few good techniques that can help you tell truth from fiction.\nDon’t trust yourself. A team of researchers at Cornell University in the US created a computer ­algorithm for detecting fake hotel reviews by analysing the language used in legitimate and phony write-ups. The computer program, Review Skeptic, is accurate about 90 per cent of the time, but humans alone performed poorly at determining the truth teller. “People are terrible,” says Claire Cardie, who helped develop the system. “I was very surprised. We just cannot tell the difference much more than chance.”\nListen to the language. Beware of extremes: overly ­enthusiastic or negative reviews are red flags. False reviews tend to use more extreme language to get their message across. So if someone says “It is the most comfortable bed ever,” entirely in capital letters, take pause. Additionally, the Cornell researchers found when it came to hotels, fake reviewers tended not to talk about the spatial details — such as the floor or bathroom.\nInstead, they focused on the reason they were there, such as ­describing a recent fake vacation or business trip. In practice, this makes sense because someone who has never been to a location may have a tough time describing it accurately.\nJunk the jargon. On the flip side, beware of recommendations that read like product manuals. Reviews that repeat the full product name or model number may be an attempt to game the search engine system. If they use excessive technical or marketing jargon, odds are they aren’t a genuine review — most real people don’t talk like that.\nReview the reviewer. Check out the profile of the person providing the review, says Louis Ramirez, senior features writer with online deal site DealNews. If they write reviews only for a particular company, that’s a huge warning sign they may have a vested interest in that business. Some sites let people upload ­pictures of the item they bought, which can add credibility.\nAmazon verifies some of its ­reviewers, indicating they actually bought the product (although some of the people it’s suing allegedly found ways around that). Some other sites allow posts only from people who’ve made a purchase there. Look closely on the site for their review policies.\nPay attention to detail. If you think about your experi­ences with an unpleasant holiday or product, you can probably ­explain exactly why it was bad. ­Ramirez suggests if you’re unsure about a review, put more stock in someone who provides details of why they didn’t like a product (“Oh, the battery only lasted four hours”) than in someone who complains more generally (“I hated this laptop. It was horrible”).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:16:01.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
