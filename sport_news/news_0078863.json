Gillespie / Baltimore Sun Media Group) Glenn Graham Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun No. 10 Arundel girls soccer walked away satisfied while Severna Park did not after a scoreless draw Thursday. \nThe Arundel and Severna Park girls soccer teams both could have used a win Thursday to further boost their confidence with the regular season quickly winding down. \nInstead, the No. 10 Wildcats and host Falcons played 80 minutes of regulation and 20 more minutes of overtime without a goal to settle for a 0-0 draw. \nA combination of responsible defense, sure goalkeeping and some missed opportunities took center stage. \nArundel goes to 5-3-2 on the season and 3-2-1 in Anne Arundel County, while Severna Park is now 4-4-2 and 3-2-2. \nWith a young roster of 11 sophomores, three freshmen, four juniors and only two seniors, the Wildcats have been a continued work in progress this season and coach Laura Coe saw the effort Thursday as another step forward. Best of Baltimore-area high school sports photos, week 5 Open link \nThey had good moments on the ball with their short passing game, stayed consistent for the most part on defense with junior Hailey Arpin the steadying influence, and when called on, junior goalie Sabrina Doherty was flawless with 10 saves. \n\"Today is the first time they have played together as a team for an entire game and I really think that when we can start finding the net, they'll hit their stride,\" Coe said. \nThe Falcons left the field thinking they missed an opportunity to claim a win. They carried the play for chunks of the second half and had two prime late chances to come away on top. With under eight minutes to play, sophomore Sarah Gellert got behind the Wildcats defense to go in alone on Doherty, but was just a smidge wide of the right post on her shot from 12 yards. Less than a minute later, freshman Kathryn Ryan had a similar chance, but a poor final touch enabled Doherty to come out aggressively to smother the opportunity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:38:21.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
