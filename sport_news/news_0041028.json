(Richard Hamm/Staff) OnlineAthens / Athens Banner-Herald Cedar Shoals' Jerphari Colbert's big night propels Jaguars to big win By Nicole Saavedra published Monday, October 5, 2015 close Greyson Lambert's girlfriend Adeline Kenerly crowned Miss Georgia during UGA-Alabama game \nCedar Shoals coach Scott Wilkins knew what sophomore fullback Jerphari Colbert was capable of. \nOn Friday, Colbert showed it, leading Cedar Shoals (1-4, 1-3 in Region 8- ) to its first varsity football win since November 2013. \n“When he became a starter midway last year, we could see, OK, he’s going to have the chance to be very good,” Wilkins said. “The fullback in our offense is the guy where we’re going to make people stop the fullback. He did a great job.” \nHeritage-Conyers couldn’t stop Colbert in the Jaguars’ 20-3 win. Colbert ran 19 times for 142 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught four passes for 31 yards. \n“I just saw big holes and I took it,” Colbert said. \n“He was a clutch short yardage back for us,” Wilkins said. “... He’s a guy you have to start accounting for. I thought the guys up front did a great job. I thought the other backs blocked very well, and he got the opportunity to show what he could do. I thought he did a good job.” \nThe win snapped a 15-game losing streak for Cedar Shoals and was the first victory since Wilkins returned for a second coaching stint at the school in 2014. Finally, the Jaguars put a complete game together. \n“It was defense one game and then the offense would be down,” Colbert said. “This game we put both together.” \nAfterward, Colbert and his teammates joined the band in the stands to celebrate. \n“After the game (Friday), it was like kids at Christmas time,” Wilkins said Saturday. \nWilkins hopes the future is bright for Colbert — and the rest of the dozens of underclassmen who make up Cedar Shoals’ roster. The Jaguars travel to Loganville this Friday. \n“I think he’ll continue to improve and get better,” Wilkins said. “He ran track last spring and became a workout fanatic this offseason. He’s a tenth-grader, he’s another one of those young players that we think are going to continue to grow as our program continues to grow.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:28:27.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
