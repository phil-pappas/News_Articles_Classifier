And then they came to Toronto, and the Jays came heavy. No matter what, one of these teams is going to be hard to bury. Grab your shovel, but be ready to fight.\nAnd that’s as it should be. In Game 3 the Jays played like themselves, like their best selves. They pounded the ball to places the Royals couldn’t chase it down unless they bought a ticket. They talked about how they needed an early lead, before Kansas City’s near-death bullpen got one. They talked about breaking out.\nHey, welcome home. Troy Tulowitzki, who was waving at balls early in Game 2, hit a three-run home run to centre, 411 feet. Josh Donaldson, with one hit in his last three games, sent a two-run homer to left centre, 400 feet. Ryan Goins, who looked eviscerated as he answered question after question about his bizarre Game 2 gaffe, added a solo shot to right centre, 392 feet. He had a nice night, Goins. He deserved that.\n“That’s what we do,” said Gibbons.\nBut two of those homers may not have gone out in the cold air of Kauffman Stadium, with its 410-foot centre field fence, to 400 in Toronto. In Toronto, they go. It was almost enough to make you wonder about the end of the regular season, and the failure to secure four games here, rather than the middle three.\nBut in the meantime, they needed it all to win this game. The Jays needed to pack it on, to keep running, to keep swinging. They needed to push the lead to 9-2, 10-4, 11-4. Because in the ninth the Royals started stringing together hits, and the Jays were forced to go to closer Roberto Osuna, who may have a cracked nail or a blister on his throwing hand, and therefore no slider, according to ESPN Deportes\nBut they held, because four ninth-inning runs wasn’t enough. They won 11-8, because they had a cushion. These are the Toronto Blue Jays. Series ain’t over.\n“I felt like we had great at-bats the entire night,” said Donaldson. “And we were able to go get that big hit for us, and I’ve always said the run is the hardest at playoff time.\n“And we’re going to have to come out tomorrow and play just as good if not better, because you see the quality of team they have over there. They don’t stop until the 27th out. They’re tough.”\nThis is what the Jays are facing. They are facing a team whose starting pitcher in Game 1, Edinson Volquez, junked the plan to throw inside because he, in his words, “felt sexy,” and decided to throw a pile of the best pitches of his life to the outer half of the plate instead. They are facing a team that starts a human hashtag named Alcides Escobar at leadoff even though it doesn’t make any sense, that strings together hits, that chases down what you hit like Rafael Nadal in his prime, and forces you to hit it better, hit it again. The Royals are baseball in its weirdly mystical sense, all in all.\nThe Jays are baseball with a club, and a bigger club, and after leaving 18 men on base in the first two games of this series, they were due for something like this. They needed this because going down 0-3 would be something close to the end, and because they needed a big enough lead that the Royals couldn’t come back. They got it.\nThe Jays came back to a changed city. They didn’t let the plebes in the 500s buy tall boys they could throw, but they could have, because nobody was throwing anything on this night. Someone brought a sign that said ‘We’re Not In Kansas Anymore,’ which must have been funny to the people of Kansas City, Missouri. It turned into a party, and it never really stopped.\nIf the Toronto Blue Jays do lose this series, they can blame the weather in Baltimore, the beer and the champagne, Osuna’s second blown save, and themselves. If it comes to that, then maybe they will rue the final few days of the season, and wish they had four possible games in this giant concrete pinball machine, and look back with regret.\nBut that’s not on the menu yet, and may never be. Right now, the Jays are back. They’re not in Kansas anymore, but then, they never were.\nMore on thestar.com\nGoins turns his luck around to get Jays back in series: DiManno\nBlue Jays make amends in Game 3 win over Royals: Griffin", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:10:29.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
