I think he's on schedule, whatever that means. There's been no setbacks.\n\"Obviously, when he trusts his ankle and feels good about his ankle, he'll then join us for practice. Then it's about practicing every day and getting his timing, his conditioning and all those things ramped up. I still think -- I'm guessing -- he's probably 3-4 weeks away, maybe two. I don't really know.\"\nMeanwhile, Red Wings forward Johan Franzen remains on short-term injured reserve after suffering a return of his concussion symptoms after playing just two games this season. He suffered the latest of multiple concussions in his career on a hit from Edmonton Oilers forward Rob Klinkhammer on Jan. 6 that ended Franzen's 2014-15 season.\nFranzen has been seeing Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, director of Michigan's neurosport program, but there is not timetable for his potential return to the ice.\nKlinkhammer was not penalized for the hit on Jan. 6 and said he was unaware until recently that Franzen was still experiencing issues.\n\"I didn't really know he was hurt, to be honest with you,\" Klinkhammer told MLive.com. \"I remember we collided, and he left the game. But I didn't realize it was serious until someone mentioned to me the other day. I thought he was playing last year. I didn't know he was missing an extended period of time.\n\"It's a crappy situation. There's life after hockey. It's your career for right now, but you've got to protect your health and your well-being, especially your mind. That's something that's really important.\"\n Hockey\nRed Wings' Pavel Datsyuk expected back mid-November 0\nPascal Dupuis returns to Penguins a year after injury, blood clots 0\nCalgary Flames head coach Bob Hartley happy for John Tortorella 0\nSenators' Chris Neil 'blessed and fortunate' to play 900 games 0\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-23T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:38:19.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
