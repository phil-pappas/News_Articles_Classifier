Simon that six times between Sept. 17, 2014 and Dec. 16, 2014 he knowingly possessed pipe bombs.\nNeal Allen Panschow Columbia County Jail Simon set Panschow's sentencing for Jan. 12. Under the terms of a plea agreement, he is expected to serve nearly six years in prison. But under federal sentencing guidelines, Simon could sentence him to as many as nine years.\nPanschow, who was held Monday in the Columbia County Jail, is suspected of persistent run-ins with Oregon authorities, including a felony charge of fleeing police in Tillamook County in March 2014.\nPortland police caught sight of him on Dec. 16, when officers witnessed his Honda Civic swerving on Southeast 52 nd Avenue. They quickly learned the car was stolen and that its driver was suspected of assaulting a police officer in Lake Oswego. When they tried to stop the car, it sped up and they lost him.\nA man in the 4600 block of Southeast Flavel Drive flagged them down, saying he saw something fly out of the passenger window of the Civic. Officers later recovered a Ziploc plastic bag that held two pipe bombs. As the Portland Metropolitan Explosive Disposal Unit moved in, two more of the destructive devices were found a couple of blocks away.\nBut investigators caught a break. They learned that Panschow had been caught on surveillance video at a Plaid Pantry in Northeast Portland on Dec. 16, about 35 minutes after he threw pipe bombs out of his car, according to the criminal complaint.\nPolice arrested Panschow five days later.\n-- Bryan Denson\nbdenson@oregonian.com\n503-294-7614; @Bryan_Denson", "external_links": ["http://www.clackamas.us/sheriff/edu.html", "https://twitter.com/Bryan_Denson"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:37:44.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
