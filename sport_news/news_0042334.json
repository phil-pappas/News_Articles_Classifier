They are: Fort Worth's Elizabeth Eder Northern, Dallas' Dawn Grunnagle, former Rockwall and Texas standout Allison Mendez, former North Texas standout Ingrid Mollenkopf and former Ursuline and Rice standout Becky Wade.\nTwo others -- Dallas' Becky Angeles and Aledo's Megan Flowers Skeels -- plan to race upcoming marathons in hopes of qualifying. Both are moms who raced in the 2012 Olympic Trials.\nThe women's A standard is two hours, 37 minutes. The B standard is 2:43 in the marathon or 1:15 in the half marathon. The qualifying window began Aug. 1, 2013, and closes Jan. 17.\nEnoch Nadler was the area's only men's qualifier. He qualified by clocking a 1:03:55 at the January 2014 USA Half Marathon Championships in Houston. He has since moved and said he's no longer training for the trials.\nNorthern will race Sunday's Twin Cities Marathon. Her goal is to run below 2:40. She set her personal best, 2:42:02, at the California International Marathon in December 2014.\n\"My shoot for the moon goal is to hit the A standard,\" Northern said. \"If I get under 2:40, I will be more in the middle range of the rankings for the trials. That will make me more confident going into the trials.\"\nGrunnagle and Mendez plan to race in the Oct. 11 Chicago Marathon. Grunnagle qualified for the trials by clocking a 1:14:56 half marathon at the June 2014 Garry Bjorklund Half Marathon in Duluth, Minn.\nGrunnagle has run one marathon, the unseasonably hot, humid ASICS LA Marathon earlier this year. She battled abdominal issues and finished in 2:56:38, which was much slower than her goal. She had another disappointing race last Sunday when cramping forced her to withdraw from the San Jose Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon.\n\"My No. 1 goal is to get through Chicago without having to stop so I have that confidence that I can run a strong marathon before I line up for the Olympic Trials,\" she said.\nMendez, a Rockwall native, lives and trains in Austin with pro team Rogue Athletic Club. She ran a 1:13:47 at the Gore-Tex Philadelphia Half Marathon in November 2013 to qualify. Chicago will be her first marathon. She also plans to race the USA 12K championships next month in Virginia.\nMollenkopf also qualified at the 2013 Philadelphia Half, where she clocked a 1:13:03. She trains with Dallas coach Robert Vaughan. She plans to race a 5K this month, the Dallas YMCA Turkey Trot 8-mile and a half marathon.\nWade, a four-time NCAA Division I All-American, won her debut marathon, the 2013 California International Marathon, in 2:30:41. It earned her the A standard for the trials. She lives in Houston and trains with her college coach Jim Bevan. Wade, recently posted that she will begin building up her mileage this fall. She plans to race at least one half marathon, possibly Houston, in January, and a few shorter road races as she builds up for the trials.\nSkeels, 41, has spent the last nine months training for a marathon. She planned to race Sunday's Twin Cities but contracted a chest cold and was forced to withdraw. She would have been competing in the U.S. women's masters national championships. She now plans to race the Oct. 11 Mohawk Hudson Marathon in New York.\nAngeles said she's training for the Oct. 24 Michelob Ultra 13.1 Dallas Half and the Nov. 7 Indianapolis Monumental Marathon.\nBriefly : Craig Lutz will make his pro debut at Saturday's USA Track & Field 10-Mile Championships in Minneapolis, which is part of the Medtronic Twin Cities Marathon weekend festivities. ...
