The referees reviewed the play for a few minutes before declaring the basket good and leaving the Fever crowd stunned.\nMinnesota leads the best-of-five series 2-1.\nGame 4 is Sunday night with Minnesota trying to win its third title in five years. The team that has won Game 3 has won 70 percent of the titles since the WNBA went to a best-of-five format in 2005. Indiana is trying to become the first No. 3 seed to win a title. The first 18 championships were won by either one or two seeds.\nThese two teams played in the finals in 2012, which Indiana won for its lone title. After splitting the first two games that season, Indiana routed Minnesota in Game 3. This one was a much tighter contest.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:13:01.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
