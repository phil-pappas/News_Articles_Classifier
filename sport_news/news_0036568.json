None of our goals have changed — it’s just how we handle the pressure this year.”\nDavis head coach Souli Phongsavath\nSALT LAKE CITY — The prediction was that 2015 was going to be the year the Davis High School girls soccer team broke free from its disappointing playoff exits and made a legitimate 5A state title run.\nNow, a year removed from winning the 2014 state title, those predictions have now become heavy expectations and pressure as the nation's sixth-ranked Darts ( topdrawersoccer.com ) have racked up a 20-game winning streak that dates back to last season and are picking up steam heading into the start of the playoffs.\n“I think the expectations are kind of what we always thought they’d be. We were a year earlier than what we anticipated, so the expectations are still high. We just have more pressure on us this year than we had last year. None of our goals have changed — it’s just how we handle the pressure this year,” Davis head coach Souli Phongsavath said.\nDavis, a talent-packed team led by players such as Ireland Dunn , Olivia Wade and Haylee Cacciacarne , is extremely well balanced and owns one of the most potent offenses and punishing defenses in the state.\nWade and Dunn have completely dominated their opponents and have combined to score 48 goals this season while Davis has blown its opponents out 100-7 in its first 16 games.\nTheir dominance on both sides of the field has sparked a perfect 16-0-0 start to the season and made them the frontrunner to repeat as state champs.\nHowever, it won't be an easy task with several talented teams gunning for the state's top-ranked team.\nDavis, which last lost to Fremont and Weber, will likely have to go through one, if not both, of the top teams out of Region 1 to reach a second straight title.\nWhile a Davis-Fremont semifinal matchup looks imminent, Weber's path to the Darts in the title match is less likely with teams such as Viewmont, Mountain Crest, Lone Peak and Brighton standing in the way.\n\"We aren’t looking past anybody and we’re just taking things one game at a time. We know we have a huge target on our backs and we just have to focus on us and play our game. There are some really good teams and we’re just trying to stay focused on the task at hand,” Phongsavath said.\nMeanwhile, the Knights, which fell to Davis 1-0 in the first game of the year, the Region-3 champ Bengals and the Region-2 runner-up Vikings are all ranked in the top-five teams of 5A and will look to make a deep run in the postseason.\nLone Peak has really found a rhythm as of late as it has won nine of its last 10 games, including seven straight and a pivotal road region win over American Fork, to help lock up the top spot in Region 4.\nThe Knights have been a force on the offensive end and are second in 5A in goals with 66 while limiting their opponents to 15 goals.\nThey are extremely well balanced and led by the trio of Cameron Tucker (18 goals), Natalee Wells (14 goals) and TJ McKendrick (10 goals) while Megan Running and Brianna Allen have combined for six shutouts in goal.\nAnd, after having its undefeated and championship season spoiled by Davis in last year's title match, Lone Peak should be eager to get things rolling and make a serious run at the defending champs.\n4A\nThe Skyline High School girls’ soccer team is the only team in the state, other than 5A's Davis, to score 81+ goals while holding its opponents to 12 or fewer scores this season.\nAnd, combined with their recent playoff success of three state championship appearances in the last four years, including back-to-back title games, the Eagles (14-1-1) should be considered one of the favorites in 4A.", "external_links": ["https://mail.bonneville.com/owa/redir.aspx?SURL=vHcLOx6ZC6OkCo2cRLKILngvOpSSS6iEsggpFFdGkPv28m0AdNPSCGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AdABvAHAAZAByAGEAdwBlAHIAcwBvAGMAYwBlAHIALgBjAG8AbQA.&URL=http%3a%2f%2ftopdrawersoccer.com"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:19:57.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
