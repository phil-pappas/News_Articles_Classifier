Kamari Murphy withdrew from Bishop Ford HS on Dec. 2, and enrolled at Lincoln HS the same day. On Dec. 14, the PSAL pronounced the 6-7 junior eligible to play basketball for the four-time defending champion Railsplitters.\nMurphy's arrival in Coney Island , and his rapid confirmation by the PSAL, has triggered a caustic backlash among rival coaches in Brooklyn .\nAt the crux of the controversy is this: Murphy was listed on Bishop Ford's active roster and played in several preseason scrimmages, Bishop Ford president Ray Nash told the Daily News.\nEligibility regulations that appear on the PSAL Web site, however, stipulate that a player found to be on an active roster at any public or private high school may not transfer and suit up with a team in the PSAL during the same season.\nThe coaches contend that the PSAL ignored its eligbility rules, and that the league applies inconsistent standards when determining the status of a transferring student-athlete.\n\"The PSAL fails in its duty to enforce the rules consistently,\" said Transit Tech coach Michael Perazzo , who said he wanted to put a spotlight on a system that is \"flawed and so far from transparent, it's almost sad.\n\"The process ... clearly needs to be looked at very closely by some type of independent body,\" Perazzo added.\nA Department of Education spokeswoman defended the PSAL's enforcement of its eligibility requirements for transfer students, saying that the league reviews each case individually. The PSAL offical ruling stated that Murphy was not on Ford's active roster when it began the investigation on Dec. 4, despite the fact that he had suited up for the school during preseason.\nThe case-by-case approach is precisely why coaches say they're so dissatisfied.\n\"Why is there so much confusion as to what the rules really are?\" said Boys & Girls coach Ruth Lovelace . \"Why do different teams get different treatment? It's pretty blatant. If you break the rules, you should be punished.\"\nOr, as Robeson coach Todd Myles put it: \"You can't have one set of rules for one group and another set of rules for someone else.\"\nBoys & Girls played Thursday's game against Lincoln under protest because of Murphy's presence.\n\"We played under protest because the rules are meant to be followed,\" Lovelace said. \"The rule ... states that a kid can't play if he's on an active roster. The rules are meant to be followed. He was on two rosters, it's clear as day.\"\nStudents who transfer between New York City public schools are required to sit out 12 months from the date of their transfer, but exceptions are granted.\nA student who transferred this year to Boys & Girls, Leroy Fludd , requested such an exception. He played his freshman season at Grady HS, but said that school officials there told him that they were suspending the boys basketball program this year.\nThe PSAL initially ruled Fludd ineligible for this season, but Fludd has appealed the decision.\nPerazzo said the PSAL dragged its feet with two of his players at Transit Tech and attempted to hold them to a different standard than Lincoln's Murphy.\nThe PSAL initially ruled Transit Tech's Richard Williams eligible after the sophomore transferred from Washington Irving . In November, the PSAL reversed course, saying he was ineligible because he suited up for two scrimmages last year and was on the active roster.\nPerazzo appealed the decision; at a pre-conference hearing on Nov. 23, PSAL executive director Donald Douglas concluded that Williams had not violated any rules and was okay to play this season.\nPerazzo was more vocal about a case involving senior Deylon Bovell, who transferred from Teachers Prep after he was mugged at knife point. Bovell sought what is known as a safety transfer, an exception that has been granted several times in recent seasons, but the PSAL declared him ineligible.\nTransit Tech appealed the ruling, but DOE hearings officer Arnold Nager denied the appeal without granting Bovell a hearing.\n\"One could reasonably draw the conclusion ... they acted with malice,\" Perazzo said of the PSAL.\nAttorney James Villani was preparing to drag the PSAL into court on Dec. 10 and ask a judge to grant an injunction allowing Bovell to play. The night before the case was to be heard, the PSAL relented and Bovell was pronounced eligible. He played his first game with Transit Tech last Tuesday, a 75-67 loss to Lincoln.\n\"You want to believe that they have the best interests of the students at heart, but based on their actions, it doesn't appear to be the case,\" Villani said. \"The case was sloppily handled (by the PSAL). If he didn't hire a lawyer, he probably wouldn't have been able to play this year, and he would have missed an opportunity to get a scholarship to go to college. He would have missed out on his entire senior season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:38:37.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
