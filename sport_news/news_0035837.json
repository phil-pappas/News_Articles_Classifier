Station dropped a close one to No. 12 Lafayette last week and will be eager to end a win streak. \nNo. 4 Scott County (5-1) at Henry Clay (3-3), 7:30: The Cardinals have averaged 54.6 points in against Kentucky opponents. The Blue Devils are coming off a disaster at Pulaski County in which they netted only 42 yards. \nClark County (0-6) at No. 12 Lafayette (5-2), 7:30: Tough opponents littered the first half of the Cards' schedule, and their winless record shows it. Can they upset a Generals team that is putting things together defensively? \nMadison Central (4-2) at Tates Creek (2-4), 7:30: Both are coming off bye weeks. The Indians hammered Woodford County 55-0 on Sept. 25, while Tates Creek was grounded by Bryan Station's tough defense. \nWestern Hills (3-2) at Lexington Catholic (3-3), 7:30: It's the first Class 3A, District 4 game for both squads, whose seasons have been up and down. LexCath has played a much tougher schedule; the Wolverines haven't given up more than 20 points in a game this season. \nLexington Christian (4-2) at Middlesboro (1-5), 7:30: Taking a two-game skid into district play wasn't the goal for LCA, but it figures to use that as motivation against the Yellowjackets coming off a bye week. Middlesboro, also off last Friday, earned its win Sept. 25 against previously undefeated Harlan. \nTOP STATE GAMES \nLawrence County (4-2) at No. 21 Belfry (5-1), 7:30: Joey Cecil's Bulldogs need a quality win after close losses against the best two foes on its schedule to this point, Montgomery County and Raceland. A victory over the Pirates would be as high-quality as it gets, but that will be tougher with Belfry coming off its first loss. \nCollins (3-3) at Central Hardin (3-3): After three straight defeats in which it gave up 35 or more points, Collins shut out high-flying Franklin County for its most significant victory since beating Highlands for the 4A title in 2013. The roller-coaster Bruins could use a pick-me-up after getting rolled by No. 6 Bowling Green on Sept. 25. \nNo. 7 St. Xavier (4-2) at No. 5 Manual (6-0), 7:30: The metrics slightly favor the Crimsons, who have three shutouts against a less-than-great schedule. Between the two, St. X owns the only win over a top-10 team (Bowling Green) and played Trinity closely last week. It also lost to Central, which Manual defeated 28-10 to open the year. \nNo. 10 Ryle (6-0) at No. 11 Cooper (5-2), 7:30: The Jaguars have allowed only seven points in two wins since falling at Simon Kenton on Sept. 18. The Raiders' Tanner Morgan is averaging 221 yards through the air and has thrown only three interceptions. \nLeslie County (6-0) at Prestonsburg (3-3), 7:30: Senior offensive/defensive tackle Blake Asher, a 6-4, 300-pound Division I prospect, leads a Leslie County team that's had three shutouts and not allowed more than 19 points in a game. The Blackcats also boast a Division I talent, Dalton Frasure (Austin Peay commitment), who has 53 tackles on defense and has scored 12 touchdowns. \nDanville (5-1) at Somerset (4-2), 7:30: While they uncharacteristically went 0-10 last season, the Briar Jumpers lost their three district games by a combined eight points, including a 21-19 defeat at Danville. Both teams are off to starts worthy of their ample tradition. \nAnderson County (3-3) at Woodford County (3-3), 7:30: The Bearcats looked poised for big things before dropping three straight. They'll look to right the ship against the Yellow Jackets, who've been more up and down than maybe any team in the state. \njosh moore, jmoore@herald-leader.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:43:34.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
