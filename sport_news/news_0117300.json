The Army says 12,405 acres may have been contaminated during the Davy Crockett days.\nFort Carson is joined on the roster by installations in Hawaii, Washington state, Georgia, Kentucky, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, South Carolina and California.\nThe Army says cleaning up the waste at Fort Carson and other installations is too expensive — the price tag is estimated at more than $25 million in Colorado and more than $300 million nationwide — so it is asking the federal nuclear watchdog agency for permission to leave the waste where it may have been for 50 years.\nA 1961 report on the Davy Crockett program shows that about 7 ounces of depleted uranium were used in each training round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:04:03.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
