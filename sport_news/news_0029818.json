After firing Joe Philbin earlier in the week, new coach Dan Campbell and the front office have continued to make adjustments to the staff. Coyle was seen as a likely target to be replaced due to a lackluster defensive effort this season. Updated Dolphins Fire Joe Philbin as Head Coach Miami entered the year as a playoff contender largely due to its expected defensive output. Through four weeks, the Dolphins have posted some of the worst defensive numbers in the game. In terms of yards allowed, Miami is ranked 30th out of the 32 teams in the National Football League. Coyle had been Miami's DC since 2012 which followed on an already long coaching career. Prior to his time with the Dolphins, Coyle made stops at the college ranks in Cincinnati, Arkansas, Holy Cross and Syracuse among others. Coyle also was a coach with the Cincinnati Bengals for a decade before joining Miami. Miko Grimes Allowed to Travel After Arrest Along with Coyle's firing, the Dolphins announced that Lou Anarumo will take over as interim defensive coordinator. Anarumo had previously served as Miamiâ€™s defensive backs coach this year. Anarumo had held that position since 2012 and is a candidate to take over the full-time role at DC if the team succeeds going forward. Jeff Burris was promoted to assistant defensive backs coach as well as part of Thursday's moves. Burris had been serving as the team's cornerbacks coach prior to this and will continue to work mostly with the cornerbacks. Published 2 hours ago \nNews breaks at inconvenient times.
