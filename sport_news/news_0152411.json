He's played 200 games so far in his three seasons and started just 43 of them for the Bucks, averaging 19.6 minutes for his career. That doesn't mean the Bucks don't see him as a big part of their future though. They recognize the impact he can have on a game and want to keep him around for quite a while.\nMarc Stein of ESPN.com is reporting the Bucks and Henson have come to terms on a four-year extension for around $45 million that will begin in the 2016-17 season. Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo and David Aldridge of NBA.com have confirmed the number of $44 million for the deal.\nThe @bucks and forward John Henson have come to terms on a four-year extension in the $45 million range, according to ESPN sources\nâ€” Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) October 2, 2015 That may sound like a lot of money for a reserve big man, especially after securing Greg Monroe 's services in the summer for three years and $51.7 million. The Bucks also have the power forward position taken care of for the future with 2014 No. 2 pick Jabari Parker likely becoming their stretch-4 and Giannis Antetokounmpo as their do-it-all wing. Henson as the first big off the bench to protect the rim and dominate the boards will be key and he can play with any combination of lineup they put him in.\nIn just 18.3 minutes per game last year, Henson put up 7.0 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.0 blocks. The offense struggled with Henson on the floor, but the defense allowed an impressive 97.6 points per 100 possessions -- 2.5 points better than with him on the bench. John Henson and the Bucks have a great deal.
