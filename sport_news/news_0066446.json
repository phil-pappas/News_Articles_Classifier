The current timetable calls for submission of applications to relocate in January, when the owners could vote.\nPittsburgh Steelers President Art Rooney said he doesn't envision that timetable being changed. He noted that St. Louis, Oakland and San Diego \"still are putting together their proposals\" to keep their teams.\nThe Rams are proposing a stadium in Inglewood, California, while the Raiders and Chargers have one planned for Carson.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:28:26.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
