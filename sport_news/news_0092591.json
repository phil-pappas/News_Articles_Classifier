Whitehall's Dezmond Boykin (3) carries the ball against Liberty earlier this season. (DONNA FISHER / THE MORNING CALL) Stephen Miller Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call How did the PIAA Board of Directors vote on the move from 4 to 6 football classes? \nMECHANICSBURG â€” Bob Hartman always thought that if the PIAA opted to increase its number of classifications, it would affect more sports than football. \nThe PIAA Board of Directors proved him right Wednesday afternoon. \nAfter an overwhelming 26-4 board vote to bump football from four classifications to six, a second vote increased the number of state championships that will be awarded in several more sports. \nGirls basketball, boys basketball, baseball and softball will join football in moving from four to six classifications starting with the 2016-17 school year. Girls volleyball, boys soccer and girls soccer are all moving to four classes. Field hockey is bumping up to three classes, and boys and girls lacrosse are jumping to two classes. \nThe changes became official in the middle of a two-hour meeting at the PIAA offices. They left a lot more people smiling than frowning. \n\"I think when schools and communities and kids get a chance to play for championships, it makes that school and community a better place to be,\" said Hartman, the District 11 chairman and Whitehall athletic director. \"It's more exciting. The halls are better. There's more spirit. There's probably better discipline, and school's more engaged. \n\"I really find it hard to believe that that's a bad thing. So I don't think it waters [the championships] down. The Single A champion will feel no differently than the 6A champion. They'll be proud of their accomplishments, as they should be.\" \nA driving force behind the move from four to six classes in football was reducing the length of the season by one week. This season, the PIAA will crown its four state football champions the weekend of Dec. 18-19. The calendar proposed for next season would end the PIAA football season by Dec. 10, 2016. \nStarting with the 2016-17 school year, schools will have the option of playing a nine-game regular season and two scrimmages or a 10-game regular season with one scrimmage. Hartman has said previously the majority of District 11 schools favor a 10-game regular season with one scrimmage. \nThe vote to increase classifications in team sports other than football met a bit more resistance but still passed with relative ease. The board voted in favor of the changes to basketball, baseball, softball, and the remaining sports by a 23-7 margin. \nBob Tonkin, the District 9 treasurer, was among the happiest people Wednesday. He began championing the idea of a six-classification system for football in May. \n\"I was hoping that football would take the lead and the other sports would fall behind,\" Tonkin said. \"I'm super happy because football did lead the way, but we have basketball, soccer, volleyball. It's in my opinion a great day for our schools, our athletes, our students in Pennsylvania. \n\"We're so out-of-whack with the rest of the country in the ratio of championships to the number of schools that sponsor the sports,\" he added. \"This has been a great move for our students.\" \nMany details of the new classification system will have to be ironed out in the months ahead. Schools have until Oct. 15 to submit their enrollment numbers to the PIAA for the next two-year cycle (2016-17 and 2017-18). Schools will hear back from the PIAA in mid-November about which class they fall in and then will have until mid-December to decide whether to play up a classification. \nChampionship brackets for the next cycle should receive their first reading in January 2016, with final approval likely to occur in May 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:22:40.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
