Organizers are hoping the event can be expanded to a 10-day \"mini slam\" by 2019.\nOver the last decade, ticket sales increased by 375 percent.\n\"We're bursting at the seams here,\" Binaghi said. \"The tournament has grown exponentially over the last decade. We don't have any more room.\"\nThe tournament could use a larger main stadium than the 10,500-seat arena that was inaugurated only five years ago. Binaghi also wants a retractable roof built for the main stadium.\nLined with neoclassical statues, the secondary Nicola Pietrangeli stadium is considered one of the most beautiful venues in tennis.\nThe federation's budget is expected to surpass 50 million euros ($57 million) this year. But the federation and the Italian Olympic Committee , the tournament's co-organizer, need the city's help to alleviate serious parking and transport problems.\nAnother big factor is Rome's candidacy for the 2024 Olympics. Under the bid plan, the Foro Italico would be used for athletics and aquatics.\n\"They are going to have to find an alternative venue,\" said Francesco Ricci Bitti , the president of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations. \"Anything can happen but I think Binaghi is just sending a message.\"\nWith Paris, Los Angeles, Hamburg and Budapest also bidding, the host of the 2024 Games will be chosen by the International Olympic Committee in 2017.\n\"The Foro is OK for now but it's at the limit,\" added Ricci Bitti, who recently ended his term as president of the International Tennis Federation . \"It's a victim of its success over the last 10 years.\"\nEarlier this year, Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova voiced player support for keeping the event at the Foro.\n\"Nothing is going to happen over the next months,\" Binaghi said. \"This is a long-term decision.\"\n___\nAndrew Dampf can be followed at www.twitter.com/asdampf", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.twitter.com/asdampf", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:10:35.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
