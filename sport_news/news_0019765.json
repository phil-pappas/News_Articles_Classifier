(AP) -- Pekka Rinne made 22 saves and the Nashville Predators ran their season-opening winning streak to three with a 3-1 victory over the struggling New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night. \nRoman Josi scored in the first period on a power play, and Gabriel Bourque and Eric Nystrom added empty-netter in the closing minutes to help the Predators get off to their best start since 2010-11. \nRinne has played a major role in that success, allowing only two goals so far. \nAnd he set another club milestone. Rinne has played 384 games, most by a Nashville goalie. Tomas Vokoun held the old mark. Rinne also owns the club records for wins (207) and shutouts (37). \nRinne lost his shutout when Kyle Palmieri scored on a power play with 1:40 left. \nNew Jersey has lost all three if its games, leaving the tandem of general manager Ray Shero and coach John Hynes looking for their first wins since taking over in the off season. Keith Kinkaid stopped 17 shots in his second straight start for the Devils. Cory Schneider missed the game for birth of his son early Tuesday morning. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
