Young Jr. School of Social Work will celebrate its 95th anniversary on Oct. 3 with a gala and symposium featuring noted industry leaders.\nThe social work’s school’s origins date back to 1920, when it was founded as the Atlanta School of Social Work. The school joined with Atlanta University in 1947, and began offering bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral level degrees when the consolidated Clark Atlanta University formed in 1988. The school was renamed to honor civil rights leader Whitney Young in 2000.\nThe celebration begins at 9:30 a.m. with a campus tour followed by a symposium discussing policies and voting rights issues affecting social workers. CAU’s president Ronald Johnson will deliver the keynote address at a 6 p.m. gala dinner in the campus’ student center.\nClark Atlanta University’s 95th anniversary gala for its School of Social Work is set for Oct. 3.
