There are times when you know ... just know deep in your bones ... that your team won't win.\nEspecially when the team facing the orange helmets is the Denver Broncos.\nFinal score: Denver 26, Browns 23. In overtime.\nOh, boy.\n\"A huge missed opportunity,\" said Browns quarterback Josh McCown. \"I'm disappointed in myself and how we played offensively. The defense played lights out. I saw Karlos Dansby gut it out and get a pick-6. ... We didn't hold our end up.\"\nThe Browns were so close to knocking off the undefeated Broncos. They were so close to making their record 3-3 and raising the hopes and heartbeats of everyone who bleeds Cleveland Browns orange.\nSo close.\n\"It makes me sick,\" said McCown.\nFans probably feel the same, because a sad message was delivered: Progress has been made, but not enough to beat a good team like Denver. After six games, the Browns are a very Browns-like 2-4. The last two losses have been on game-ending field goals.\nThis brought up the old Josh Cribbs line, \"We almost always almost win.\"\nWHAT COULD HAVE BEEN\nDenver opened the overtime period with the ball.\nAnd Barkevious Mingo ... that's right, Mingo who played only four snaps last week ... the often-criticized Mingo picked off a Peyton Manning pass, giving the ball to the Browns on the Denver 39.\nTalk about a great story being written. The Browns were about 10 yards away from being in field goal position. But McCown was sacked, not once but twice.\nThat's why McCown sounded as if his dog had just died after the game. It's why the videotape in his mind will keep reeling over and over, making him wonder what he could have done differently.\nHad the Browns won, Manning would be feeling the same way. The Browns picked off three of his passes. Denver's offense scored only one touchdown.\nBut Manning put together a game-winning drive when it meant the most. The Browns did not.\nBIG PLAYS AT THE END\nTo be fair to McCown, the defense wilted as Manning drove his team 72 yards in 13 plays to set up the winning field goal. That drive started on the Denver 12.\nHow about forcing a punt? Instead, the defense buckled.\n\"If I had been better, we would have won the game,\" said McCown.\nMany Browns on either side of the ball could say the same thing. Coach Mike Pettine did a lot of headshaking after the game. The burden of losing had a fist-like grip on his football soul.\n\"It's a tough deal,\" he said. \"We were not able to finish it.\"\nBoth teams actually seemed to win and lose this game at different points. But in the end, Denver did it right when it meant the most.\nPettine will be in for some second-guessing going for a two-point conversion with 8:07 left. Dansby had returned an interception for a touchdown. The Browns had a 20-16 lead.\nPettine went for two, thinking that he'd be up by six points (two field goals), rather than five with an extra-point kick. But the attempt to score the two points failed.\nIt would haunt the Browns for the rest of the game.\nRUNNING OUT OF COMEBACKS\nThe Browns kept coming from behind. They were down 10-0 at the half. It was 16-7 Denver early in the fourth quarter. The Browns came back to lead, 20-16. Then fell behind, 23-20.\nRegulation ended with the score 23-23.\nThe Browns are playing hard, but not always smart. That does count for a lot on any given NFL Sunday. They were facing the best defense in the NFL, a nightmare for any quarterback.\nMcCown was 20-of-39 for 213 yards. He threw two beautiful touchdown passes to tight end Gary Barnidge. But a McCown pass was picked off and run back for a touchdown. A McCown fumble led to a Denver field goal. He was sacked four times, including those two in the overtime.\nSTAYING THE COURSE\nBut this is not the time to think for one second about Johnny Manziel taking over at quarterback. Manziel embarrassed himself and the team with his recent driving incident with his intoxicated girlfriend. No one was charged by the police, but the event was disturbing.\nThe Browns trust McCown. He is keeping them close in every game.\n\"We just made too many mistakes to come away with the win,\" said Pettine.\nA few plays, the difference between 3-3 and 2-4.\n\"It's so frustrating to be home and that close and come up short,\" said Pettine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:51:02.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
