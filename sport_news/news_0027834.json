Who is the most likely candidate to start the second game? Is it Zack Greinke? Brett Anderson? Hyun-jin Ryu? Alex Wood? David Price? Someone else entirely?\nFor a 92-win team, there stands to be so much renovation over the next four months before pitchers and catchers report and the cycle starts again. The truth is, that was probably going to be the case with a World Series win or a September collapse.\nTake a small step back, and you see that this was sort of a rebuilding season for the Dodgers, with so much money due in years to come that they agreed to eat in one swoop. But nobody wants to hear about that. Everybody wants to hear about the future.\nSo, here goes: One 2016 starting pitching slot is set. Three or so relievers and six or seven position players also seem likely to be brought back. Then, the remaining majority of next year’s roster looks currently unformed, particularly at key spots.\nGreinke, of course, is going to opt out of the remaining three years on his contract, even if he hasn’t confirmed as much yet. He is going to get at least five years from some team and perhaps twice the $71 million he is due.\nThat team could be the Dodgers. More likely, it will not be the Dodgers.\nAnderson might be the most likely candidate baseball has had yet to accept the $15.8 million qualifying offer the Dodgers might submit to him. The thing about his season is, yes, the team bet that he would stay healthy and he did, but they also bet that he would be the same pitcher he had been before, and he was not that. He was perfectly serviceable, but maybe not much more than that. He might not be worth $15.8 million.\nRyu is trying to recover from surgery to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder. The list of active major-league pitchers who have returned from labrum tears and from Tommy John, as Ryu did as a teenager, is not long. But Ryu is still young, 28 until the end of spring training, and he worked harder than he ever had this season, according to his teammates.\nWe could piece-by-piece analyze each potential roster member, but we won’t. Just know this: Changes will abound.\nWhat will stay the same? Well, the defense was significantly better this year than last, and that stands to remain a hallmark of this regime. The baserunning turned from bad to average after the midseason hiring of Ron Roenicke, introduction of Jose Peraza, activation of Carl Crawford and establishing of a speed camp for minor-league prospects. The suddenness with which those all occurred indicated the Dodgers realized they underestimated the importance of team speed.\nWhat will change? Surely, the Dodgers are going to continue to search for injury-prevention solutions. What they tried this year did not work. Their pitchers tore ligaments, and their position players strained muscles. General Manager Farhan Zaidi acknowledged as such before the playoffs.\n“A lot of times when a team has a rash of injuries and you look back, the explanation more often than not is just a string of bad luck,” Zaidi said. “For the most part, I think that's the case here, but it's not going to stop us from looking for a better answer.”\nThey will look for that answer in unconventional places.\nBehind the scenes this season, the Dodgers began to develop their research and development department. Doug Fearing took charge of that department in June, and brought aboard several analysts. They also revamped their minor-league development and international scouting departments, letting loose many longtime organizational employees over the last month.\nAmong the R&D hirings was Dr. James Buffi, who completed his doctorate in biomedical engineering at Northwestern this year. In April, he led the publishing of an intriguing computer-simulation study of pitching that found that the strength of the elbow muscles in pitchers likely plays a bigger role in injury risk and prevention than previously thought.\n“Muscles matter in baseball,” Buffi said in a university press release. “We showed that a pitcher could be at a really high risk or a really low risk of elbow injury, depending on how strong and capable his muscles are.”\nThe Dodgers have so far not let their research and development staffers talk to the media. Much remains unknown about what they’re trying to do.\nReally, we know only that 2016 will be different.\nContact the writer: pmoura@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:07:44.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
