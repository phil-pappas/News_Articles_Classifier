But that was precisely the Bears' undoing Sunday.\nIn a 37-34 overtime loss at Ford Field, the Bears surrendered far too many chunk plays to a desperate opponent, the longest a 57-yard heave by Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson that set up a game-ending, chip-shot field goal.\nThe Bears entered Week 6 ranked fourth in the NFL in total defense, allowing only 16 completions of 20 yards or more, none longer than 34. Stafford, who was benched the week before during a crummy performance against the Cardinals, had eight passes that went for 20-plus as the Lions rolled up 546 yards on 76 snaps. Five of the gains were for 34 or more yards.\nWhile the secondary hadn't been great, it had executed the variety of coverages defensive coordinator Vic Fangio calls and had prevented shots over the top while being mostly sound in tackling and swarming to the ball to reduce yards after the catch.\nThe Lions hurt the Bears both ways with Johnson essentially getting man coverage against Harold Jones-Quartey on the bomb as Stafford created extra time by rolling out of the pocket. That's a bad matchup for any safety, let alone a rookie with a 6-inch height disadvantage.\nNickel cornerback Sherrick McManis was in a tough spot chasing Lance Moore on a 20-yard touchdown pass. Kyle Fuller, who made some nice tackles, missed Golden Tate, as did Adrian Amos, on a 22-yard play. Running back Theo Riddick faked out Jonathan Anderson and shook a McManis tackle effort on a 34-yarder.\nJones-Quartey missed a tackle on a 43-yard catch and run by Johnson, and McManis bumped into Fuller trying to chase Moore across the field on a 42-yarder. Add a nice throw by Stafford to Johnson for 39 yards despite decent coverage by Tracy Porter and a good back-shoulder throw for 26 yards to Moore against McManis, and it was a rough outing.\nOn the disputed 2-yard touchdown pass to Tate, Fuller made a nice move to pop the ball out, but if he had arrived a step sooner, the Bears wouldn't have lost the replay review.\nSecondary grade: 2.\nDefensive line\nGrade: 2\nIt's impossible to evaluate the pass defense without taking a close look at the pressure on the quarterback, and that was lacking. Stafford, far from the most nimble quarterback the Bears will face, was able to create too much time for his targets to come free, such as on the 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tim Wright.\nLinebackers\nGrade: 7\nPernell McPhee atoned for a costly yet borderline roughing-the-passer penalty late in regulation with a terrific bull rush to pancake right tackle LaAdrian Waddle and sack Stafford in overtime. Sam Acho made a nice play forcing an Ameer Abdullah fumble and stuffed Tate for a 3-yard loss on a pass play, but McPhee is the only outside linebacker getting pressure on the passer. Christian Jones has reduced the number of false steps he's taking. Rookie Jonathan Anderson, who played 41 of the 81 defensive snaps in the nickel package, was around the ball for more than his interception (and overturned interception), and that is encouraging.\nQuarterback\nGrade: 7\nJay Cutler continued to play with the pocket presence that his elevated his game under offensive coordinator Adam Gase, climbing the pocket and avoiding the rush to create throwing lanes. He was mostly accurate, and his numbers would have been better than 26 of 41 for 353 yards had there not been four drops, including a tough one by Alshon Jeffery streaking down the sideline. But the end-zone interception was costly. His fade throw to Jeffery was flat and easily intercepted by Rashean Mathis, taking sure points off the board.\nOffensive line\nGrade: 5\nCharles Leno continued to show his advanced learning curve at left tackle, handling an array of moves by Lions defensive end Ziggy Ansah in pass protection. The running game is suffering somewhat as rookie center Hroniss Grasu settles in. The Bears had 19 carries up the middle that totaled 38 yards, with five going for no gain or a loss. They can't consistently look to the perimeter to run, and right guard Vladimir Ducasse continues to struggle. Right tackle Kyle Long had a rough game with penalties, and this wasn't the Lions front of a year ago.\nRunning backs\nGrade: 6\nMatt Forte ran a nice wheel route to get wide open with linebacker Josh Bynes in coverage, but Cutler overthrew him. It was a good example of how effective he can be lined up wide. Forte and Jeremy Langford got what was blocked, which wasn't a lot.\nWide receivers\nGrade: 8\nJeffery was dynamic after missing four games with a hamstring injury, showing his ability to dominate cornerbacks on back-shoulder throws on the final drive of regulation and how his 6-foot-3 frame makes him a mismatch on high throws in the end zone on his touchdown. The return of Eddie Royal also opened creative screens.\nTight ends\nGrade: 3\nMartellus Bennett was targeted 11 times and made only six catches for 59 yards. He's not winning the one-on-one matchups he should with his size advantage.\nSpecial teams\nGrade: 5\nThe presence of Josh Bellamy and Demontre Hurst to create two takeaways on muffed punt returns was outstanding. Allowing the personal protector to zip 30 yards around end on a fake punt was hard to accept. Robbie Gould remains perfect on field goals.\nbmbiggs@tribpub.com\nTwitter @BradBiggs\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Detroit Lions Matthew Stafford Golden Tate Alshon Jeffery Matt Forte Vladimir Ducasse", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625a644/turbine/ct-biggs-bears-film-session-spt-1020-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:26:08.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
