That can happen, it happened to Petr Cech already [this season], you have to accept that.\"\nWenger claimed that an inability to stay tight at the back following Sanchez's equalizer was to blame for his side's defeat - with back-to-back losses making hopes of progression appear gloomy with consecutive fixtures against Bayern Munich to come.\n\"[Qualification] is still possible but it's difficult to swallow losing a game like that,\" he added. \"It was a combination of a lack of defensive concentration, good defending from Olympiacos and also bad luck as well.\n\"They had four shots on goal and we conceded three, it's difficult to swallow. I felt it was a typical game where you dominate but you have to absolutely be focused and not make the task more difficult.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:37:53.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
