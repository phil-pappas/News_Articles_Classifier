On the other hand, FC Pune City are positioned third having suffered a reverse in their last home game against Delhi Dynamos. With two wins and a defeat, the hosts have six points from three games.\nSet to play in their fourth consecutive home match this season, the David Platt-coached side used the Englishman's vast experience to good effect in the first two matches of the league, before faltering against a Robin Singh-inspired Dynamos on Wednesday. They will have to regroup now, with the formidable ATK looking eager to continue their momentum.\nThe arrival of young Indian players Eugenesin Lyngdoh and Jackichand Singh, who missed the first three games due to national commitments, will boost the home side. Holding the key upfront will be former Turkey striker Tuncay Sanli, who shone for Pune in the first match scoring twice.\nWhat can work in Pune's favour is that the table toppers will miss the services of marquee player Helder Postiga who returned to Portugal for treating a hamstring strain sustained during the first match. India player Baljit Sahni will join the team, and there are also a few youngsters waiting to make a mark in the ATK jersey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:03:32.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
