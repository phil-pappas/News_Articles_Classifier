Posted: Saturday, October 24, 2015 6:00 am Sharpsville seizes control of Region 1 with win at Farrell By ED FARRELL | Herald Assistant Sports Editor The Herald FARRELL – The Farrell Weave is part of the Shenango Valley’s athletic lore. It helped hoist 7 state championships for Farrell’s basketball program under legendary Eddie McCluskey. Friday night at Farrell’s Anthony J. Paulekas Stadium, Sharpsville High’s football team displayed its version of the weave. The Blue Devils’ best defense was its time-consuming, keep-away offense. It stymied the Steelers’ stable of skill-position playmakers. Led by Khaliq Ragster’s game-high 27-carry, 195-yard rushing performance, the Blue Devils defeated Farrell, 26-8, to secure the Region 1-A regular-season championship. “They called us out. Social media, through texts, they called us out, and we love it! We love the disrespect and doubt. We want to show everybody,” Ragster related from Lou Falconi Field. “We haven’t beaten these guys in, I don’t know how many years, and that’s what matters – league champs and on to D-10. “I want to play ‘em again. They probably think that this is a fluke, but I know we can do it again,” added Ragster, relating to a potential rematch with Farrell for the District 10 Class A crown. The Blue Devils are the defending titlists. Sharpsville (5-0 region, 8-0 overall) controlled the line of scrimmage and amassed 20 more plays (62-42) and outgained the Steelers, 370-207, including a 316-52 margin in rushing yards. Three of Sharpsville’s scoring drives were a game-opening 14-play, 71-yard, 8-minute, 55-second march; a 9-play, 51-yard, 4-minute, 25-second drive that extended its edge to 14-0, and a 15-play, 61-yard, 7-minute, 17-second 3rd-quarter series. Each ended in touchdowns, respectively, Tyrin Peavy’s 4-yard run and 7- and 1-yarders from Ragster. “We knew it had to come down to our line, driving, and not giving their team a lot of opportunities. But the surprising thing is our defense played rather well (Friday) night; we went to the ball,” summarized Sharpsville skipper Paul Piccirilli. “Khaliq ran hard ... Peavy ... I can’t say enough about any one of these guys on this team. “That’s one of the most overwhelming victories that I’ve had,” Piccirilli added. “I struggle against coach over there (Farrell’s Jarrett Samuels). He plays us tough. There’s no doubt in my mind that he’s gonna be there in four or five weeks; I just hope we can get there.” The Blue Devils’ defense limited Steelers stalwarts Braxton Chapman (12 carries, 56 yards rushing), Alex Myers (12 completions in 20 pass attempts for 155 yards, but three pickoffs), and Marcus McCoy (3 catches, 57 yards). But if was the Blue Devils offensive line that dominated. “You’ve gotta keep it out of (the Steelers’) hands. If they have twenty touches a game, they’re gonna beat you. We did that well this time; hopefully if we play ‘em again we can do it next time, Piccirilli praised, citing linemen Chris Mueller, Brady Hogue, Bobby Demofonte, Jaquay Hubbard, and Mitchell Swartz, along with tight ends Donnie Keck and Dakota Griffin. The Steelers’ sliced Sharpsville’s lead to 14-8 with 7:32 remaining to intermission. Chapman sprinted 23 yards to culminate a 7-play, 65-yard, 5-minute, 5-second march, then Myers ran in the 2-point conversion. But Farrell’s first 2nd-half drive ended in a Hogue interception, enabling Sharpsville to assume a 2-score stretch on Ragster’s second run. Piccirilli pointed out a crucial 14-point swing that subsequently ensued. Trailing 20-8 Farrell forged from its own 34-yard line to Sharpsville’s 1. But on 4 goal-to-go plays Chapman (2), Malachai Newell (0), Myers (0) and Chapman again could not dent the Blue Devils’ goal line. Mueller actually recovered a fumble on the latter, and that set up Sharpsville’s final score – a 13-yard Luke Henwood-to-Bobby Besser scoring strike. “We scored on the one on fourth down goin’ in (Ragster, 4th-and-goal, with 1:55 left in the 3rd quarter), and then we stopped them, so that’s a fourteen-point turnaround,” Piccirilli pointed out. Regardless of Ragster’s post-game contention, Piccirilli said, “Usually we get emotional for one game, it seems like. There was a lot of stuff, talking by both teams, but I want to say this, honestly: I think both teams played hard, kept their mouths shut for the most part, and had respect, for the most part, and that’s what high school sports is all about.” For Farrell (4-1, 7-1), Steelers’ skipper Samuels assessed. “(The Blue Devils) ran downhill, and we couldn’t stop them. There were a lot of key fourth-and-shorts and third-and-shorts and they converted. I give them all the credit. “They came into our building, our house, and established themselves. They dominated,” Samuels graciously praised, admitting, “And we didn’t help ourselves. Four turnovers, that’s something we haven’t done all season, so we didn’t help our own cause.” Regarding a rematch, Samuels said the Steelers’ sights are set only on a Week-9 date with Mercer. “We’ve gotta get back to the basics, start working on defending the run, taking care of all the little things. So we’ll go back, watch the film of this, evaluate, and work toward Mercer, trying to get better week by week. “We can’t look forward, We’ve gotta get ourselves back on track, doing all the things that made us successful the first seven weeks.” ——— SHARPSVILLE 7 7 6 6 26 FARRELL 0 8 0 0 8 Scoring plays S — Peavy, 4 run (Williams kick) S — Ragster, 7 run (Williams kick) F — Chapman, 23 run (Myers run) S — Ragster, 1 run (kick failed) S — Besser, 13 pass from Henwood (run failed) Team stats", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:56:52.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
