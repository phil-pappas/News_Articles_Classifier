I know — New York! What was that experience like, getting to the semifinals in singles and doubles of the U.S. Open junior tournament? \nAnswer: It was an unbelievable experience, especially playing in the United States, something I will never forget. Hopefully one day, I can be back for the pros.\nQ: What was the closest you got to playing on Arthur Ashe Stadium court? \nA: The closest I got was the players’ cafeteria that is attached to Arthur Ashe. But it was a pretty nice cafeteria, so …\nQ: How does that work, logistically? You are in the junior draw instead of the open draw, but do you use the same locker rooms and whatnot? \nA: Unfortunately, we don’t get to use the same locker rooms as the pros. The closest we get to them is eating in the same area and maybe sitting next to them in the players’ lounge, but that’s about it.\nQ: Who was the most famous player you ran into? \nA: I took a picture with Serena Williams, but it’s really bad, so unfortunately I can’t post it. Then I saw Roger Federer getting food at the cafeteria, so I went back to get more food just to stand in line with him. More importantly, though, I saw Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian.\nQ: Is that gauche? Is it impolite to make a scene if you bump into Federer in the hallway? \nA: Yes, the staff really doesn’t like people taking pictures with the pros because the players’ lounge is where the pros are supposed to finally be able to relax. So not many juniors take pictures with them.\nQ: Did you get any autographs, or is that totally uncool? \nA: No I didn’t. It’s pretty uncool.\nQ: What about giving autographs? Every Open match I’ve ever watched, I think, the winner walks over and signs these enormous tennis balls; did you ever get asked for your autograph? \nA: Yes, I did sign some, but I think it was more the parents forcing their kids to ask. They didn’t look too enthused, but oh well.\nQ: Have you now played in all four major tournaments? \nA: No I haven’t. I missed the Australian Open this year because I was coming back from an injury.\nQ: Which is your favorite Grand Slam event that you have played? \nA: The U.S. Open, mainly because I did well and it was in the U.S.\nQ: Did the U.S. Open live up to its reputation as the wildest of the four Slams, especially for you as an American? \nA: It definitely did. I think in my semifinal match, my match was the only match on for juniors and pros, so I had a huge crowd cheering for me, which was pretty cool. People get really into it and intense and it just pumps you up even more. Too bad I didn’t win.\nQ: What has been the most difficult transition to college? \nA: Definitely it has been trying to balance tennis with school and a social life. Trying to decide what to get at Kcom (Kennedy Commons) or Marketplace gets pretty tough, too.\nQ: Are you getting to ease into your college tennis career? \nA: Yes, I just came back from my first college tournament and I really enjoyed it. It’s still pretty new to me, having a coach and teammates with you, and representing your school, but I really like it.\nQ: How tall are you? I’ve read some things that indicate you’re not particularly tall but that you play with a lot of fight. Does that sound accurate? \nA: I like to say I’m 5 feet 7, maybe even 5-8 some days, but I have been told otherwise. Yes, I do like to play with a lot of fight. I don’t usually get the sportsmanship award, let’s just say that.\nQ: Is there an advantage to being a left-hander? Back in my day, lefty John McEnroe didn’t have a lot of power but he angled the ball all over the place. \nA: I think there is an advantage, mostly with the serve and angles. It’s nice to pull someone out wide on the ad side and have an open court on the serve.\nQ: Who is the best left-handed tennis player of all time? \nA: Not really sure who is the best, but John McEnroe was pretty good.\nQ: Who is your favorite player of all time? \nA: I loved Kim Clijsters and Li Na because they both hit the ball so clean and were so balanced and could move so well.\nQ: And against whom would you most like to play someday? \nA: Simona Halep.\nQ: I’m sorry that all this tennis talk has left no time for family matters. What can you tell us about yours? \nA: I am Italian, I am one of four kids, my brother went to Ohio State, but didn’t play sports, my sister is a junior at Xavier University and plays tennis for them, and my little sister plays high-school tennis but she’s really social so probably won’t play in college. My dad is a pediatric doctor at Nationwide Children’s (Hospital) and my mom is an Italian teacher.\nQ: That name of yours is lovely, but it’s obviously a lot of syllables. Is there a shorter version or nickname you answer to? \nA: No. I like to keep it long. I’m not a big fan of nicknames.\n \nrstein@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:45:22.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
