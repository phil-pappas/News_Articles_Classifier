Ditch 'em! # 2 iFnotWhyNoT @ 10/20/15 12:37 PM DITCH, DITCH, DIIIITCH # 3 Lisac @ 10/20/15 12:46 PM One word- Garbage! and thats me being nice! # 4 Trojan Man @ 10/20/15 01:06 PM Confidence and drive goals are both rubbish and make no positive contribution to franchise mode to my mind. Give me features that help me realize what I see on Sunday, like specialized formation subs and personnel packages, and ditch the RPG gimmicks that have no place in football games. # 5 kbb33 @ 10/20/15 02:29 PM They had time to do this trash, but we've been waiting for formation subs and being to sub RBs without doing it manually for years. # 6 booker21 @ 10/20/15 03:23 PM DITCH, DITCH, DITCH. Sim games doensÂ´t have drive goals, so this is cheating from the beginning. # 7 asu666 @ 10/20/15 04:42 PM Ditch them. Too much potential for needless bugs and imbalances with little return. # 8 zizoux @ 10/20/15 06:33 PM Get rid of them altogether. Also I hate coaching schemes change players' overall ratings. For example, they make a 94 ovr player 99, a 80 ovr player 73 etc. I've never liked that feature since its debut. # 9 bukktown @ 10/20/15 06:59 PM I want sooo bad for CFM games to play like Play Now. # 10 kadzier @ 10/20/15 08:23 PM drive goals were definitely messed up this year- sometimes they're literally impossible to get based on where you start the drive, or they reward you in situations you should not (or vice versa). On top of that they encourage random statpadding gameplay. scrap em. # 11 fballturkey @ 10/20/15 08:25 PM Confidence could be toned down and reworked into something that makes sense. Drive goals provide no value whatsoever to the game. # 12 briz1046 @ 10/20/15 08:36 PM Have no idea why they were ever introduced when the people who pay their wages have been clamouring for work in other areas for so long and having their voices fall on deaf ears If you want to make an RPG go do it but don't force it on people who are looking to play an NFL career mode Ditch them both and listen to your consumers # 13 Step2001 @ 10/20/15 09:24 PM I ignore Drive Goals & run my Offense & Defense the way I want. As for confidence, tone it down or do away with it. # 14 rkocjay @ 10/20/15 09:57 PM ditch them as well as the schemes # 15 Robo COP @ 10/20/15 10:07 PM I'm loving the response so far. Let's hope madden take notes when a sample size of their customers shows that well over half of them want nothing to do with either feature. As others have said in this thread as well as many others, listen to the consumers. If you want to bring in a new feature, that's understandable, but make sure the base product is what the consumer wants before you dump too many man hours in a feature nobody cares about. I feel like nobody really thinks through new features. Somebody has an idea, and if it is liked by whatever board decides these sorts of things they run with it without actually looking into what it could impact in their own game. Anyway, I'm about to start rambling. I'm very encouraged by the improvements in the on field gameplay, now it's time the crew ramps up franchise mode and does away with the nonsense", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:09:49.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
