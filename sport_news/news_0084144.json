The New Zealand Breakers will begin using the compression and protective wear the following season.\nAs part of the agreement, McDavid and Shock Doctor will receive naming rights to digital content shared via the NBL's new content channels, which will track the recovery of an injured player, giving the brands valuable recognition among the significant NBL fan base.\nIn 2015, McDavid and Shock Doctor merged to form United Sports Brands (USB), a global leader in sports performance and protective products designed to help athletes perform at their best.
