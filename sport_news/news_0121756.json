As there is no movement of vehicles, trains have been transporting urea through Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh for the past five days. Two days ago, IFFCO in Faridkot urged the Railways to stop the movement of urea rakes outside Punjab as the unloading and transportation were not possible due to the blockades. But the authorities refused to entertain the request, causing losses to handling-transport contractors of IFFCO as they will have to pay heavy penalties. If the unloading is delayed, A fine of Rs 1,000 is imposed on a contractor. As per the details provided by the Department of Fertilisers, Government of India, 33 rakes have been distributing urea among various districts of Punjab since October 14. Carrying over 30 lakh bags of urea, the Railways is transporting urea from IFFCO, Aonla, (Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh), Mundra Port (Kutch district, Gujarat), RCF Thal (Raigad, Maharashtra), TCL Babrala, (UP), KSFL Shajahanpur (UP), CFCL Gadepan-I (Kota, Rajasthan), KRIBHCO Hazira (Gujarat), Pipavav Port (Gujarat) and NFL Panipat (Haryana). IFFCO and handling-transport contractors are bound to unload the urea from railway wagons within 10 hours of the arrival of these wagons at the railway station. “The corporation is facing a great difficulty in storing the stock,” said Jaswinder Singh, regional area manager, IFFCO. IFFCO has 39,824 cooperative societies associated with it and it is responsible for the distribution of 70 per cent of the fertilisers used in the country. The Department of Fertilisers entrusts the responsibility of ensuring movement, distribution and allocation of subsidised chemical fertilisers to IFFCO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:12:58.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
