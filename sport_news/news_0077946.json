The game capped Spokane's six game road trip, their longest of the season, as the Chiefs finished 2-3-1. Spokane did pick up a point in the OT loss, as they are now tied for first in the U.S. Division with Tri City with 7 points on the season with a record of 3-3-1. \nSpokane took a 1-0 lead at 12:59 of the first period when Jason Fram scored his 4th goal of the season from Jordan Henderson and Keanu Yamamoto. Everett would tie the game at one as they scored a power play goal on their 3rd attempt of the period at 18:26. The Chiefs would be outshot 10-7 in the first as Everett went 1-3 on the power play. Spokane got a power play chance in the final half minute of the period and would convert their second man advantage of the night early in the second. \nFram would notch his second of the night, and team high 5th goal of the season just 46 seconds into the second period to give the Chiefs a 2-1 lead. A Matt Fonteyne breakaway at 3:13 of the period would bring Everett back even at 2-2. Hudson Elyniuk's power play goal, his 4th of the year from Dominic Zwerger and Kailer Yamamoto, at 6:09 of the period put Spokane back on top at 3-2. Everett would score back to back power play goals just 1:54 apart late in the second to take their first lead of the game at 4-3. Spokane would come back and equalize the score when Evan Fiala scored his first career goal at 17:20 from Markson Bechtold and Jacob Cardiff as the two teams went to the third at 4-4. Both teams were perfect on the power play in the period, as Spokane was 1-1 and Everett 2-2. \nThe third period would see the Silvertips outshoot Spokane 15-9 in the stanza, but neither team was able to score as Chiefs goalie Garret Hughson made some big saves in the final minute to preserve the tie. In the 3 on 3 overtime, Everett got the only two shots of the period and scored on Laurencelle's net front tally to hand Spokane their first OT loss of the season. The Chiefs were outshot 39-29 in the game, going 2-3 on the power play and just 2-5 on the penalty kill. \nSpokane will return home Friday to open a 5 game homestand, their longest of the season, when they host the Prince Albert Raiders at 7:05pm.
