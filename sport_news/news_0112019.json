Smart won 6-4 for his second victory of the day as he improved to 3-0. (COLIN CORNEAU/BRANDON SUN) \nAt a senior bonspiel last year, a competitor from Brandon pointed to a sign at the Boissevain Curling Club which had the year the club was established. A comment was made about how it’s turning 125 years old and they should do something to celebrate. \nThat statement hit the members hard and they started working on a big party. After all, there’s a lot to celebrate. Boissevain’s club is member-owned and operated and has survived for almost as long as the organization now known as CurlManitoba, which is in its 127th year. \n\"We have a very nice rink and we have such dedicated volunteers,\" said Lorraine Houston, a member of the club’s 125th anniversary celebration committee. \"One takes care of the kitchen and one takes care of the bar. We all have a bit of our heart there to make sure that it continues because we all enjoy pretending that we might advance to something big. \n\"It’s an anchor part of our community. It’s just as important as the skating rink across the street and the bowling alley which is attached to it. It’s all part of adding activities to the community.\" \nThe club is marking its 125th with a senior bonspiel on Nov. 12 as well as an open bonspiel from Nov. 13 to 15. There will also be a banquet and social at the Boissevain Legion Hall on the Friday evening. People who register for the open bonspiel will also get tickets to the banquet and social. \nHouston said Boissevain’s club has dwindling numbers, like many across the country, and she hopes the three-day open competition will bring out young people who want to play the game so they can learn how social and fun curling can be. \n\"I’m seeing interest in people,\" she said. \"Because it’s open, they like to know it’s a social event and they don’t have to be good at it so they’re not worried about people who curl two to three times a week at the top end. That’s not the type of bonspiel we’re after.\" \nThe bonspiel will have cash prizes, which will be awarded after each game, and all curlers who enter the event will have their name in a draw to win a $500 travel voucher, Winnipeg Jets tickets, Manitoba Moose tickets or a case of agricultural chemical products. They will also auction off a Team Canada jacket autographed by Jennifer Jones’ foursome, a shirt signed by Mike McEwen and a jacket signed by Kerry Burtnyk at the banquet. McEwen and Burtnyk have previously played at the Boissevain club. \nMembers are also working to have the club’s history on display, digging up old sweaters and trophies. They even found an old set of curling rocks from when teams brought their own to the rink. There have also been a lot of donations from the local business community. \nThe big weekend is still a few weeks away, but Houston is getting excited. \n\"You bet,\" she said. \"We’ve been meeting once a week and every one brings a new surprise.\" \nThe cost to register for the senior bonspiel is $60. For more information, contact Ken and Wendy Clyne at 204-534-2594. The cost for the open bonspiel is $200 per team. For more information, contact Houston at 204-534-6479, email editor@therecorder.ca or visit boissevain.ca. Tickets are also available for just the banquet or social. \nBERTH BONSPIELS: Stonewall is hosting junior men’s and women’s berth bonspiels from Friday to Sunday, with two provincial spots on the line in each event.
