He entered a Week 6 win over Arizona in relief of injured Michael Vick and completed 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns in less than two quarters. Jones performed better than Vick within a talented Steelers offense, one that got a boost with the return of wide receiver Martavis Bryant, and likely gets another shot with Vick sidelined by a hamstring injury. If starter Ben Roethlisberger (knee) is held out as expected, Jones is an intriguing deep-league play facing a Chiefs defense that has allowed the second-most passing touchdowns (15) in the NFL.\nChristine Michael, RB, Dallas Cowboys: It's unclear just how big Michael's role will be this week, and there are grumblings that Joseph Randle will still get a sizable majority of the carries. Still, the Cowboys coaching staff made two other significant changes, inserting QB Matt Cassel and rookie OG La'el Collins into the starting lineup, and was clear that Michael would get more touches going forward. The lack of clarity should keep Michael on fantasy benches in Week 7, but his outlook is promising enough to justify a desperation FLEX play for those struggling for answers or facing an uphill battle against a superior opponent. Michael has impressive physical talent and is poised to run behind one of the NFL's most dominant offensive lines.\nAhmad Bradshaw, RB, Indianapolis Colts: Bradshaw played in a limited fashion in his return to the Colts last week with five total touches for just nine yards. Signed as a free agent just days prior to the Colts' Week 6 loss to New England, Bradshaw has now been afforded more time and practice reps in advance of a friendly Week 7 matchup against New Orleans, which has the third-worst run defense in the league. Bradshaw has shown he's a tremendous sidekick, and he could be a real threat as a pass-catcher next to Frank Gore. The same role yielded eight touchdowns in just 10 games last season before he broke his leg. Gore is a dominant force on first and second down, but he could start deferring more and more third-down work to Bradshaw as soon as this week.\nStefon Diggs, WR, Minnesota Vikings: Diggs has high upside in ALL formats, even 10-team leagues, as his arrow continues to point up. The rookie has 13 catches for 216 yards in his last two starts and is pushing hard for a permanent starting job, even when injured Charles Johnson returns to the lineup. Diggs has a budding rapport with quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and fills a need in the Vikings offense, and he now gets a listless Detroit Lions defense that ranks last in the NFL in opponents' passer rating (110.3) and average yards per reception (9.1). The momentum and matchup make Diggs a high-reward FLEX play, even if his role remains unclear and his track record consists of just two games.\nChris Hogan, WR, Buffalo Bills: Sammy Watkins has been ruled out and Percy Harvin is on the verge of retirement with a hip injury, clearing the way for Hogan, Robert Woods and Charles Clay to play bigger roles in the passing game against Jacksonville in London. Where Woods has disappeared at times, Hogan has proven himself reliable as a possession threat with 13 catches (on 17 targets) for 168 yards and two touchdowns in his last four games. The former lacrosse player has a limited ceiling but a decent floor, given the Bills' depleted depth chart at wide receiver. His role as a target in the possession game makes him even more useful, particularly in PPR leagues, with backup E.J. Manuel at quarterback.\nEric Ebron, Detroit Lions: Ebron is on course to return after a two-game absence with a knee injury, an ailment that derailed his early-season momentum. The talented second-year player rolled up 12 catches for 157 yards and two touchdowns in his first three games, offering hope he was on the verge of blossoming after a disappointing rookie season. Ebron now has a chance in Week 7 to pick up where he left off against a Vikings team that has had lapses against quality tight ends. That includes Ebron's five catches for 43 yards and a touchdown in Week 2. Ebron comes with additional risks in the rematch but also potential for great rewards as he returns to health.\nWashington Redskins D/ST: The Redskins come with risk but great potential, as well, as a defense that yields points and yardage but has its strong points, too. Washington has surrendered 20-plus points in each of its last four games, but with eight takeaways and two return touchdowns over that stretch. The team is allowing 4.4 fewer points and 16.3 fewer passing yards per game than it did last season, so it's trending in the right direction. The Redskins' strengths match up well at home against a Tampa Bay offense prone to mistakes and/or unwilling to push its luck with rookie quarterback Jameis Winston. Gamblers have good reason to expect turnovers and double-digit fantasy points in this one.", "external_links": ["http://www.pennlive.com/fantasyfootball/", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/229282471&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:46:34.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
