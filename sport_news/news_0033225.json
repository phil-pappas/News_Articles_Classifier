My wife says I cannot. Can you confirm this?\nYou've cited a supremely reputable source, but you've missed a key point.\nOregon does allow drivers to make a left turn on red, but only when turning onto a one-way street. And of course, only as long as opposing traffic is clear and you've come to a complete stop.\nYes, it feels wrong. Yes, you'll probably get funny looks. And what's worse, readers have reported in the past that they've been pulled over by police for this perfectly legal but unnatural maneuver.\nHere are the rules:\nYou can turn left on red from a one-way street onto a one-way street. You can turn left on red from a two-way street onto a one-way street. You cannot turn left on red from a one-way street onto a two-way street. You definitely cannot turn left on red from a two-way street onto a two-way street. If a sign says otherwise — \"no turn on red,\" for example — then the sign trumps the general rule.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive has, in fact, written about this numerous times previously, mostly because no one can quite believe it, including police officers . So drivers who frequently avail themselves of this Oregonian privilege might want to print out page 24 of the Oregon Driver Manual to keep in the glove box.\nPrevious coverage:\nSome Oregon lefts on red aren't entirely safe, but they're legal\nFree left on red: Do Portland traffic cops need a crash course on obscure Oregon law?\n-- Elliot Njus\nenjus@oregonian.com\n503-294-5034\n@ enjus", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/enjus", "http://www.oregon.gov/odot/dmv/pages/form/manuals.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:25:43.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
