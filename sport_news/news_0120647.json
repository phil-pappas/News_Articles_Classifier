I have spoken to many patients who have had their babies here, a knee replaced, weight loss surgery performed and much more. My own family member had excellent care in the emergency room.\nNurses with more than 25 years of experience have chosen to stay with this hospital “family” because of the good work being done here.\nAs the only nonprofit community hospital in Riverside, our leaders have a fiscal responsibility to use every dollar efficiently and effectively. I believe that our administrators are working toward making us the best hospital possible.\nI have never worked with an organization that could not improve something, and it is unfair to paint the hospital with a broad brush of negativity when so many good people and so much good care are at the heart of who we are.\nDonna Doty Michalka\nRiverside\nCommunity relations, Parkview Community Hospital\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
