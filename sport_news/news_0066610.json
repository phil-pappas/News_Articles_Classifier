Tom Poti was born in Worcester, but bought a summer home on the Cape in 2002 during his 14-year NHL career. All three now live year-round in Centerville, and all three have sons of about the same age. Poti, Nickulas and LaCouture wanted to coach their sons, so they started the Cape Cod Penguins, a team for kids ages 5-6 that recently kicked off its first competitive season in Falmouth. “Two of us have 5-year-old sons, and the other has a 6-year-old son, so we figured why not start a team,” Poti said. “We’re excited. We got on the ice the other day, and we’re just happy to coach our kids and help the other kids in the community.” Poti, a silver medalist with the U.S. Olympic hockey team in 2002 and co-founder of Golf 365 Cape Cod In Hyannis, said he has 20 boys in his program, which started as basically a practice-only squad last year. He said it’s a coed program, but no girls signed up. Practices began a week prior to the Penguins’ first game. They’ll practice twice a week this year, typically in Hyannis or at Tony Kent Arena in South Dennis, then split into two squads of 10 that alternate playing on Saturdays. Games are played in the X-Ice League at the Falmouth Ice Arena, a three-on-three league in which a buzzer sounds every minute of the 50-minute game. The next three players on the bench go in with each buzzer, assuring equal ice time for everyone. “It’s a perfect amount of kids because we want to give the kids a lot of personal attention,” Poti said. “The kids get a lot of chances to touch the puck, a lot of chances to score goals and have fun with it.” It’s an 18-game season that ends in early March. Falmouth High School coach Paul Moore serves as director. The games might offer chances to pass and score, but Poti said Penguins practices tend to feature a lot of races and circle drills designed to get the players comfortable with “skating, skating and more skating.” Stick-handling and shooting don’t matter if a player can’t stay upright, Poti said, so skating always comes first. “With hockey, it’s all about your edges,” Poti said. “It’s all about development for us.They’ ;re at the perfect age right now where they’re kind of molding themselves into young players.” Despite the emphasis on fundamentals and development, Poti said youth hockey still ultimately comes down to having fun. “They’re still very, very young. You don’t want to ruin the sport for the kids by always yelling and being mean and being on top of them,” Poti said. “When (a player is) out there having fun, he’s going to be learning things he doesn’t even know he’s learning.” The Penguins aren’t by any means the only hockey option for 5- to 6-year-olds, referred to as “Mites” by USA Hockey, on the Cape. Other Mites teams are based in Sandwich, Falmouth, Orleans and Dennis, among other locations, and they’ve been around a lot longer than the Penguins. Still, nothing beefs up a coaching resume quite like playing in the NHL. “The uniqueness of our team is obviously (that) we offer over 35-plus years of National Hockey League experience. Hockey has pretty much been our whole lives,” Poti said. “We’re so happy to pass on all the knowledge and skills we’ve gained over the years onto the kids of our community.” By Matt Goisman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:23:59.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
