It marks Dorsey's second stint as CEO since he helped start the San Francisco company more than nine years ago.\nTwitter dumped Dorsey his first time around, but its board of directors now appears convinced he has the maturity to fix the problems that has caused the company's stock to lose nearly half its value in the past five months.\nDorsey will step down as chairman from the company, but he will continue as CEO of Square Inc., a company he co-founded in 2009.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
