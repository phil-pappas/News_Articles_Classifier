In addition, he became just the fourth quarterback to throw 400 career touchdowns when he connected last Sunday during a rout of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nIt was Brady’s eighth time winning the monthly honor, tying him with Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning.\nIn addition, Stephen Gostkowski earned the AFC Special Teams Player of the Month nod, the third time he’s achieved that. Gostkowski leads the NFL in scoring with 35 points. He is 7-for-7 on field goals and has hit all 14 of his extra-point attempts. Gostkowski set an NFL record for consecutive extra points last Sunday when he hit his 423rd straight.\nIn other news, the Patriots have filled each vacancy on their active roster and practice squad.\nThey promoted defensive tackle Khyri Thornton from the practice squad to the active roster. It’s Thornton’s second stint on the 53-man roster this season. They also officially announced the trade that sent Michael Hoomanawanui to New Orleans for defensive lineman Akiem Hicks.\nThe four practice squad additions included the re-signing of defensive end Eric Martin and the signings of wide receiver Austin Hill, defensive back Brandon Dixon and offensive lineman Sean Hickey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:15:07.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
