Stewart and Mike Hughes for a violation of team rules, keeping them sidelined for Saturday's game against Wake Forest. \nIn a release, the school said Stewart and Hughes were suspended from team-related activities tied to an Oct. 4 incident in Chapel Hill. The release didn't specify exactly what rule they had broken, though a statement from coach Larry Fedora referenced an \"altercation\" and that UNC has worked with Chapel Hill police to gather information. \nFedora said coaches \"hold our players to a high standard, and M.J. and Mike will face the consequences for their involvement.\" \nStewart has started all five games for the Tar Heels (4-1), while Hughes has played all five games as a reserve. \nUNC released this statement: \nNorth Carolina sophomore cornerback M.J. Stewart and freshman cornerback Mike Hughes have been suspended indefinitely from football team-related activities for a violation of team rules related to an incident that occurred Sunday, Oct. 4, in Chapel Hill. Neither Stewart nor Hughes will play in Saturday’s game vs. Wake Forest. \n“We have been aware of this situation since the night of the altercation and have been working closely with the University and Chapel Hill Police to gather relevant information,” said head coach Larry Fedora. “We hold our players to a high standard and M.J. and Mike will face the consequences for their involvement.” Read or Share this story: http://on.wfmy.com/1RLfUIe TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:19:25.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
