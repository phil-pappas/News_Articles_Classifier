Barrett seized it definitively on Saturday night in Ohio State’s 49-7 victory over Rutgers.\n\nBarrett led the top-ranked Buckeyes (8-0) to touchdowns on six consecutive possessions before leaving early in the fourth quarter.\n\nNow the Buckeyes head into their bye week with clarity at the quarterback spot. Meyer didn’t deny that matters.\n\n“It really does,” he said. “I don’t want to admit that, but it does.”\n\nBarrett led the Buckeyes to the brink of the postseason last season before suffering a broken ankle in the fourth quarter against Michigan. Despite finishing fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting, Barrett was unable to retake the job this season from Cardale Jones, who was at the helm for Ohio State’s magical postseason run.\n\nNow Barrett has. On his first carry Saturday night, he ran for 39 yards. That drive ended when he fumbled after running into receiver Michael Thomas. His performance was nearly flawless after that.\n\nBarrett completed 14 of 18 passes for 223 yards and three touchdowns and ran 13 times for 101 yards and two scores. The offense, for the first time all season, felt complete behind a quarterback who provides a true dual threat.\n\n“Ask a defensive coach,” Meyer said. “Anytime you’ve got a guy who can throw and run, that’s a problem. That’s what J.T. gives us.”\n\nBarrett was voted a captain by his teammates, which Meyer believed might have been an honor unprecedented for a sophomore. That’s a reflection of Barrett’s leadership and poise. \n\nAsked how nervous he was Saturday night, Barrett dismissed the idea.\n\n“There weren’t nerves,” he said matter-of-factly. “I was just confident in our game plan and what I’m doing as a quarterback. I was nervous last year the first couple games, but now I’m not nervous or have any jitters.”\n\nOf course, Saturday night’s rout wasn’t a one-man performance. Ezekiel Elliott, held to 15 yards on nine carries in the first half, broke a 55-yard touchdown run to give him 142 for the game as the offensive line adjusted to Rutgers’ defense.\n\nThomas turned a short completion into a 50-yard touchdown with a nifty move. Braxton Miller made an over-the-shoulder catch for a 45-yard gain while bobbling the ball as he tumbled to the ground. Miller then set up a 2-yard Barrett touchdown run with a 16-yard scamper on a direct snap.\n\nThen there was the defense. Rutgers moved methodically down the field on its first possession, only to have a 29-yard field-goal attempt deflect off the upright. On the Scarlet Knights’ next seven possessions — ending in six punts and a Gareon Conley interception — they gained a total of 81 yards.\n\nThe Buckeyes were denied a shutout only when Rutgers scored with 13 seconds left against Ohio State backups. Rutgers was overmatched, but that has been the exception this year. The Scarlet Knights, who lost by only a touchdown to Michigan State two weeks ago, scored 55 points in a comeback win against Indiana last week. They were averaging more than 34 points.\n\n“(To) basically pitch a shutout for 59 minutes, that was a tremendous effort by our defense,” Meyer said. “We won the field-position battle, but the thing that you’re not seeing is the self-destructive stuff, whether it be turnovers, interceptions or penalties.”\n\nThe Buckeyes didn’t commit a penalty, and Barrett’s fumble was the only turnover.\n\nOhio State apparently escaped the game with no injuries, but they welcome the off week to let their bodies heal and mentally prepare for a November that’s expected to be more challenging than September and October.\n\nThe first College Football Playoff rankings will be released a week from Tuesday. The Buckeyes may not have looked like a No.1 team for much of the season, but they did on Saturday night.\n\nbrabinowitz@dispatch.com \n\n@brdispatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:33:55.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
