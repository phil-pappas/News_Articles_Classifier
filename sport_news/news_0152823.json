Join the Conversation Auburn Authority Matthew Stevens , Montgomery Advertiser 9:14 a.m. CDT October 5, 2015 Auburn QB Sean White talks about conservative run game plan in 35-21 win over San Jose State. Matthew Stevens \nAUBURN – After turning to Sean White at quarterback the last two weeks, the Auburn coaching staff have failed to be definitive White will be the starter after this bye week. \nFollowing the 35-21 victory Saturday over San Jose State, Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn left the door open for a quarterback competition this week as the Tigers have 10 days to prepare for a Thursday night matchup at Kentucky (4-1, 2-1 in Southeastern Conference) on Oct. 15. \n“We will keep taking this thing week-to-week like we have been doing it,” Malzahn said Saturday night. “We are starting to get good answers to the questions that we needed. There are a bunch of new guys out there, a bunch of young guys in certain situations, so we have a better idea moving forward.” \nIn the previous two weeks, Malzahn’s answer to the quarterback situation has been “Sean White is our quarterback” but he and offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee left the situation open to possibly return to Jeremy Johnson , who started and struggled Auburn’s first three games of the 2015 season. \n“We’re just going to take it game by game right now,” Lashlee said Sunday night. “Sean has done, in the two games he's played, a very nice job. I think he's protecting the ball well through the air for the most part, he's making good decisions, he's making accurate throws and I think our guys are responding to him.” \nAuburn quarterback Sean White (13) and Auburn quarterback Jeremy Johnson (6) warm up before the NCAA football game between Auburn and San Jose State on Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015, at Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn, Ala. ;<br /> Albert Cesare / Advertiser (Photo: .) \nWhite finished Saturday 6 of 10 for 108 yards with no touchdowns but also no turnovers . Malzahn said the bye week would be important for the coaching staff to “take a big picture view” on a lot of positions including quarterback. \nThrough two games, White has yet to throw a touchdown pass but only has one turnover in 38 pass attempts. Auburn is currently 116th in the nation in passing yards yet White seems to have the confidence of his teammates. \n“I would say the confidence in Sean is through the roof,” Auburn tailback Peyton Barber said. “It’s very high as not only a game manager but also to make the throws we need at any point in a game.” \nWhite said Saturday night he didn’t mind the play calling in the second half to exploit San Jose State’s struggling run defense with Barber. The sophomore tailback got over 100 yards in the fourth of five games this season and is fifth in the SEC in rushing at 111.6 yards per game. Auburn coach Gus Malzahn talks about 35-21 win over San Jose State Saturday. Matthew Stevens \nAuburn (3-2, 0-2 in SEC) turned White, a redshirt freshman getting his second career start at quarterback, only attempted two passes in the second half against San Jose State Saturday. Despite not showcasing it in the play calling Saturday, Malzahn said he still has confidence in the 6-foot signal caller to make throws down the field. \n“I am very confident; we just didn’t need to today,” Malzahn said Saturday. “We ran the football, and we had short fields. If we had to throw the football, I feel as good as you can about a guy who is a second start.” Auburn OC Rhett Lashlee on 35-21 win over San Jose State. Matthew Stevens \nWhite, who was referred to by his private summer coach, his high school coach and Elite 11 instructor Trent Dilfer as a \"program changer\", was asked to just attempt three passes over 10 yards from the line-of-scrimmage. White had problems with ball security Saturday as he had three fumbles, all of which were recovered by Auburn but Lashlee said that certainly be a point of emphasis this week will be to tell White that rushing yards aren’t as important as bringing the football with you on scrambles. \n“I think our quarterback had something to do with a couple of (the fumbles),” Lashlee said. “At the same time, like I told him, he is not a running back. You get what you can and try to get down. He tried to run over a couple of guys right there, and we need to do a better job of that in the future. The coaching factor as far as ball security has to get better.” Buy Photo \nAuburn quarterback Jeremy Johnson (6) high fives fans during Tiger Walk before the NCAA football game between Auburn and San Jose State on Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015, in Auburn, Ala. (Photo: Albert Cesare / Advertiser) \nJeremy Johnson hasn’t taken a snap at quarterback since being benched after the 45-21 loss at LSU and the junior from Montgomery said he “would have no reaction” to Auburn making a quarterback change. Johnson was seen at wide receiver Saturday when Kerryon Johnson was behind center in the Wildcat formation. Lashlee said that wasn’t so Jeremy Johnson would stay mentally engaged but that formation was set up in preseason practices and the starting quarterback at the time (Jeremy Johnson) has always been lined up out wide. \n“He's very engaged,” Lashlee said of Jeremy Johnson. He reps everything Sean does every week and he's ready to play. A lot of time had a quarterback involved in our Wildcat formation. That's nothing unusual and he's done it before. He did it last year when Nick was playing quarterback, he was our guy. That's just kind of part of the package.” \nMalzahn said the game plan Saturday gave Jeremy Johnson “some packages if the situation presented itself” and Lashlee said he’s been impressed with how the former Auburn starter has reacted to the benching before the 17-9 loss to Mississippi State. \n“Jeremy has handled it very well, he's practicing hard,” Lashlee said. “So, yeah, those guys have to compete every day, just like everyone else does, but they both have to be ready to play. You never know what's going to happen in a game.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RqK3MN Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:59:52.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
