Three matches remain on the district schedule, and only one of them will advance to the postseason as Edcouch-Elsa, PSJA High and Donna High have clinched playoff berths from 32-5A. \n“This was probably the best feel-good win we’ve had all season,” Pace coach Gavin Rudder said. “It’s always a huge match when we play Porter. It’s probably one of the better rivalries here in Brownsville. When we get together, it always is a big match and it means a lot to each team. I couldn’t have dreamed this (ending) any better.” \nRoy Hess covers sports for The Brownsville Herald. You can reach him via email at rhess@brownsvilleherald.com .
