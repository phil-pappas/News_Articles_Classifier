Not when the judge said his statements to police did not add up. Not when the judge found the boy guilty of stabbing to death an 8-year-old in her home. Not when his stepmother called out from a seat in the courtroom behind him, “We love you.” After a 17-day trial, Calaveras County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Smith Tuesday afternoon found the teenager guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Leila Fowler. The boy, now 15, was 12 in April 2013 when the murder took place. He will be sentenced at 1:30 p.m. Nov. 4. He faces being held in juvenile detention until he is 23. After the verdict was read, the boy’s father stormed out of the packed Department 3 courtroom. Other family members shouted their disapproval. Someone came into the courtroom and hurled an epithet toward the judge and law enforcement. The judge said he spent considerable time on the case and looked at all the evidence. “He’s given numerous inconsistent statements,” Smith said. He noted that the defendant took a long time — more than a minute according to testimony — to tell a 911 operator that the girl was wounded. “The 911 call just doesn’t make sense,” Smith said. As Smith talked about why he came to his decision, the parents occasionally glanced at one another and shook their heads. Smith said the timing of what the defendant described did not make sense as well. The boy said he heard a door slam, then about five seconds later he heard the intruder say something along the lines of “come out” and then about 10 seconds later he said he saw the intruder leave. “It just doesn’t seem possible that it happened that quickly,” Smith said. After the verdict, Mark Reichel, one of the boy’s attorneys, said he believes his client is innocent. “We are obviously devastated,” he said. “His story was torn apart, but we believe that science was on our side.” Throughout the trial, the defense emphasized that DNA of an unknown male was found during the analysis of Leila’s sexual assault kit and that unidentified fingerprints were found in Leila’s Rippon Road home. In his statement to law enforcement officials, the boy said he was watching Leila while her parents were at a baseball game nearby. He heard a man saying, “Hey, I know you’re in there. Come out.” Then he said he heard Leila screaming. When he came out of a bathroom, he saw a black man with long gray hair, wearing a black shirt and blue jeans, fleeing out the back door. The boy said he briefly chased the intruder, and stopped at the home’s back door. In a 911 call the day of the murder, the defendant told the dispatcher he was in the bathroom when he heard Leila screaming. Leila had been stabbed 22 times, mostly in the chest. She also had been poked more than a dozen times with an unknown object. She was found in the bedroom of her Valley Springs home. The murder took place April 27, 2013. The boy was arrested May 11, 2013. Leila’s death caused a huge outpouring of support from the community. Hundreds turned out for a vigil held in her honor. The boy stood in the front row. During the prosecution’s rebuttal Tuesday, Dana Pfeil, Calaveras County deputy district attorney, acknowledged that the prosecution did not provide a motive for Leila’s murder, but said that does not mean the defendant is innocent. “Only (the boy) knows the motive for the crime,” she said. “And we may never know why he did this.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:54:12.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
