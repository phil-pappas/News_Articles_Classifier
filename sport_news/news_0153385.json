They’ll face ornery Ledyard, which lost its first game last week to Bacon. … New London has lost two straight and has scored a combined 25 points in the last two games. Bacon and Fitch were successful at limiting receiver Major Roman. Now the Whalers face one of the ECC’s best defenses. … Ledyard also can’t stumble much more to make a return to the Class M playoffs. \nBacon Academy at Stonington, 6:30 p.m. \nRecords : Bacon (3-0); Stonington (0-3) \nLast week : Bacon defeated New London 25-22; Stonington lost to Windham 42-20 \nOutlook : Bacon Academy earned even more votes in the state polls this week following its win over Ledyard. The Bobcats debuted two weeks ago after defeating New London. It’s been the best two weeks to be a Bobcat in a while. … Stonington has not played well yet this season. The Bears lost to Windham last week. They’ll contend with the ECC’s best thrower — and perhaps best quarterback period — in Sean Kelly. \nGriswold at NFA, 6:30 p.m. \nRecords : Griswold (2-1); NFA (2-0) \nLast week : Griswold defeated Woodstock 42-6; NFA defeated East Lyme 54-12 \nOutlook : Griswold, despite its perch at a much smaller school, is 3-3 against NFA in the last six games. The Wolverines are off to a solid start again, although a victory here would be a significant upset. NFA played a solid second half against East Lyme and has emerged, with Bacon, as the elite of the ECC in the early season. \nSaturday’s Game \nCapital/Achievement at Thames River, 12:30 p.m. \nRecords : Capital/Achievement (2-0, 2-0 Constitution State Conference); Thames River 1-2, 1-2) \nLast week : Capital/Achievement defeated Platt Tech 44-14; Thames River lost to Harding 55-5 \nOutlook : Thames River’s foray into the Constitution State Conference was supposed to provide some scheduling relief. Not so much last week against Harding. This is another big test. Capital/Achievement, a cooperative of two Hartford magnet schools, averages 44 points per game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:22:51.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
