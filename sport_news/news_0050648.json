It’s currently off season for the Red Stars and the National Women’s Soccer League. \nHere’s the Christen Press intro video: Press makes her @TheBuzzer debut as an embedded correspondent with the American Outlaws in Pasadena leading up to kickoff of the CONCACAF CUP between Mexico and the United States on Saturday. \nOn the same exact day that this was announced, the Chicago Red Stars also published a Christen Press promotion. (Her publicity team is really busy today!) \nPress was named a member of the PAC-12 All-Century Women’s Soccer Team. \nPress (2007-10), a recent FIFA World Cup Champion and NWSL Best XI, completed her Stanford career as the 2010 NCAA leader in goals (26) and points (60). The awards continued to stack up for Press in her senior campaign, as she was the 2010 Hermann Trophy winner, 2010 Soccer America Player of the Year, 2010 PAC-10 Player of the Year and 2010 NSCAA first-team All-America.
