Richardson's conversion pass was incomplete in the back of the end zone.\nHeritage coach Tim Hammontree said he also would have gone for two points from the 3-yard line without the penalty.\n\"Up front, they were beating us up pretty good,\" Hammontree said. \"We did a great job on defense on the goal line, but I guarantee you if we went for one, we were going into double and triple overtimes more than likely. We needed to win it outright and go home and get ready for next week.\"\nDavis also had two interceptions and returned one for a touchdown.\nWright's 9-yard touchdown run gave Heritage a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter.\nWest tied it on Zach Harshey's 61-yard TD pass to Jermaine Buchannon.\nWright's 76-yard TD run put Heritage up 14-7 with 1:33 left in the first quarter, but the Mountaineers went nine possessions without scoring again.\n\"It was a big effort by our defense tonight,\" West coach Jeff Harig said. \"We continue to put them in situations that are not great, but certainly we're going to put this thing together in all three phases.\"\nDavis intercepted a pass and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown to tie the game with 5:22 left in the third quarter. West took a 21-14 lead on Harshey's 30-yard TD pass to Demarcus Smith late in the third.\nThe Rebels had third-and-goal at the 1 midway through the fourth and were stopped for no gain on two rushing attempts.\n\"We couldn't punch it in on two attempts, and in hindsight, probably should have kicked the field goal,\" Harig said.\nDave Link is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:18:56.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
