(Chris O'Meara | The Associated Press) Comments \nSyracuse, N.Y. — The Syracuse Crunch goalie situation just got a lot more interesting. \nAccording to reports out of Tampa Bay, veteran NHL goalie Kevin Poulin cleared waivers on Sunday afternoon and will be assigned to the Syracuse Crunch. Tampa Bay originally picked up Poulin off waivers from the New York Islanders in the preseason, but he has yet to play this season. He is earning a base salary of $600,000. \nKristers Gudlevskis, the Crunch's No. 1 goalie, is currently in Tampa Bay. He turned in an outstanding effort in a 1-0 overtime loss to Chicago on Saturday. \nGudlevskis is presumably holding down the No. 2 backup spot with the Lightning until Andrei Vasilevskiy is ready to return. Vasilevskiy, recovering from surgery to remove a blood clot, should start practicing with the Lightning this week and will likely join the Crunch for some rehab starts very soon. \nMeanwhile, the Crunch currently has goalies Allen York and Adam Wilcox on its roster. York is an ECHL recall and can be returned to that league. But Wilcox is a rookie that the Lightning wants to get minutes at the AHL level. \nThe arrival of Poulin in Syracuse, combined with the eventual return of Gudlevskis, may force Wilcox to the ECHL. That decision may not have to be made for a few days, however, until Vasilevskiy is ready to play in Tampa Bay again and the Lightning has to put Gudlevskis or Vasilevskiy in Syracuse. \nPoulin, 25, played 45 games for the Bridgeport Sound Tigers, compiling a 16-21-7 mark with a 2.87 goals-against and a ,912 save percentage. \nHe will not be with the Crunch for its game in Rochester today.
