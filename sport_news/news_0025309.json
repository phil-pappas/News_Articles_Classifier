Reeg led the Coyotes in both categories with 19 kills, 17 digs, while adding three blocks. Dotseth posted her first collegiate double-double with 11 kills and 16 digs. \nAdding to the Coyotes double-digit kill total were juniors Haley Jorgensen and Lindsey Brown with 12 and 10 kills apiece. Sophomore setter Brittany Jessen spread the offense with her match-high 58 assists. \n“We are very excited about this win,” South Dakota head coach Leanne Williamson said. “We rebounded better than I could have imagined. Headed into set four, the team was determined to close it out and not let the match end up in five sets. \n“Brittany did a tremendous job of spreading out the offense. With four players in double-digit kills, we become very difficult to defend.” \nDefensively, senior Kelsey Biltoft led the way at the net with two solo blocks and four block assists. Five Coyotes put up stops at the net. In addition to Reeg and Dotseth’s digs, senior defensive specialist Kaitlyn Hastings and freshman libero Lauren Mattison tallied 12 and 11 digs, respectively. \nThe Coyotes started out set one with a 5-0 run behind back-to-back kills from Reeg. The Jaguars tied the match up at point 13, but a kill from Jorgensen and an ace by Reeg gave the Coyotes a two-point advantage. After the scored tied up again at 20, the Coyotes finished off a 5-1 to take the set 25-21. South Dakota combined for 18 kills and recorded an attack percentage of .469 in the first set. \nIUPUI bounced back in set two, winning 25-21, and tied the match at a game apiece. \nSet three led to 13 ties/leadchanges. With the Jaguars leading 19-14, Williamson called a key time out that led the Coyotes on a 11-3 run. Brown finished off the set with back-to-back kills to put the Coyotes up 25-22. \nSouth Dakota took an early lead 10-4 lead in the fourth and final set. The team combined for 20 kills to win the set and the match 3-1. \nThe Coyotes combined for 65 kills, 71 digs, and 16 total blocks on their way to knocking off IUPUI. \n“Our two league wins are against top teams,” Williamson commented. “I don’t think our record is a true indicator of how good our team is. We need to continue to focus on our consistency and that begins with our match tomorrow against Fort Wayne.” \nSouth Dakota is back in action Saturday night as the team hosts Fort Wayne in the Coyote Den at 7 p.m. \n\nCourtesy: USD DISCLAIMER: The views of the author are not necessarily those of this station, its owners, officers, agents or employees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:12:31.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
