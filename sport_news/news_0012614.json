Jim Bohren and Ald. Joe Heidemann voting against the measure. Several members were still absent at the final vote: Job Hou-Seye, Julie Kath, Don Hammond and Mark Hermann, but all were though excused. \nA portion of the council approved the move in an early test vote in the Committee of the Whole last week, with most agreeing that the estimated $47 million in road repairs needed to maintain and update the city's local road network necessitated some sort of increase in revenue. The wheel tax would not cover the entire funding gap needed to maintain roads, but would likely be combined with an extended garbage fee and additional bonding. \nBut the meeting this time around came with more vocal opposition. A group of opponents submitted a petition of more than 150 signatures opposing the tax and asking the council to reject it. However, the petition was only referred to a standing committee well after the vote had already been taken. \nIn addition, three residents came to speak against the tax. One of them, Rachael Cook, told the council that as a stay-at-home mother with a limited household income, even $20 added on to the registration fee for her truck is enough to cut into their very tight budget. \n\"We're very careful with our money to make sure we're not relying on government assistance for everything that we need,\" Cook said. \"We budget, when money gets tight we eat macaroni and cheese and I can tell you we just can't afford to help pay for the roads. When I look at the roads I don't think about how much they need fixing, I think about that they're getting us from A to B and think do my kids have everything they need tomorrow.\" \nFollowing her speech, city council critic Jason Peters handed her a $20 bill, adding \"Here you go, because I know they're going to vote for it.\" \nOn the flip side, Henry Jung, a member of the Capital Improvements Commission, urged the committee to approve the fee, saying it was essential to improving the city's network of roads and was a relatively small sacrifice to make -- especially considering how often needed road projects have been delayed. \n\"For me, giving up one fish fry a year would not be an inconvenience, even including a beer and paying the tip that's expected of me,\" Jung said. \nThe council seemed largely to agree with Jung, with the exception of Bohren and Heidemann. While several aldermen noted their usual opposition to taxes, they argued there seemed to be no way around it given the funds needed to repair the city's roads. \n\"It's just a down payment,\" said Alderman Bryan Bitters. \"Even at its best, it's something for the Public Works Department to count on, which was Ald. [Bill] Thiel's premise when he first proposed it. Remember, this also assumes that nothing in our budget changes, nothing gets worse. The slides we saw in the presentation, that's probably a best case scenario.\" \nThe aldermen added several last minute provisions to the ordinance, however. While the measure already stipulates that the money is not to be used on non-road spending, an amendment from Bohren added the stipulation that none of the funds from the fee can be used on equipment -- only materials and labor. In addition, the ordinance was amended to sunset 10 years after passage, as the schedule of repairs would last only nine years. \nReach Jason Smathers at 920-453-5167 or jsmathers1@sheboyganpress.com. 75 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://shebpr.es/1LHjvWZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:51:40.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
