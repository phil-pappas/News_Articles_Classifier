WEST POINT, N.Y. — As the Knicks head to the final day of training camp at West Point Military Academy they have gone through all of the bonding exercises, watched the cadets work their way through arduous drills, heard the speeches of Army leaders and now they hope that it sinks in to provide some sort of chemistry.\nThe Knicks believed it last year, too, the first year that the team gathered here for camp. But the lessons were lost in a dismal 17-65 season, the worst in franchise history. With only four players here who were in camp last season, it might be hard to argue about the talent that it has in camp. But they hope the chemistry will carry them this time.\nWhile acknowledging they don’t have the stars they sought in free agency, the mantra through the first few days has been chemistry and sense of team — a point that was echoed by the man who still symbolizes it in franchise lore. Willis Reed has been a camp observer, watching with his former teammate and current Knicks president Phil Jackson, and he echoed the sentiment.\n“I just don’t think there was good chemistry, and I think that was a problem the year before,” Reed said. “This wasn’t a by-chance selection of players. I think Phil and Derek [Fisher] and [general manager] Steve [Mills] … I think all of them got together with the scouts — they picked these people because they think these are people — some of them had been in the league — these are guys that have a chance to come and be a part of something and actually have a career. I think that’s a good part of this.”\nWhile expectations have been tempered this year with Jackson unwilling to predict a playoff berth, Fisher and Carmelo Anthony have said this week they still have that as a goal.\n“Character. A professional mind-set,” Fisher said. “You’re not in the NBA if you’re not talented, so I don’t think we have to get into who’s talented. But just the character of the group and the way we’re approaching what’s going on daily, I think those are going to be the strengths.\n“We’re going to have some rough nights and some rough stretches. But I think we have the beginnings at least of a group that’s going to be able to handle the adversity and setbacks that come with a long NBA season. The basketball part will take care of itself as long as we become a team. I think we have the type of guys that are interested in being a team.”\nReed pointed out that the competition for jobs could be a benefit for the team, singling out Anthony as the lone sure thing in the starting lineup and adding Kristaps Porzingis (who sat out scrimmages again Friday with a sore left knee) as a likely addition — with everything up for grabs after that.\n“There’s some young players out there that understand there’s an opportunity here,” Reed said. “My thing was [as a rookie player] I came to camp and I said, ‘You know what, there’s somebody that played on the Knicks last year that won’t be playing next year because I’m going to have that spot.’ That’s what’s I think some of these guys [think]: ‘This is a chance for me.’\n“Nobody’s going to take ’Melo’s spot. But after that, everybody is saying, wait a minute, who’s playing all these other positions? So you’re going to get a lot of competition and you’ve got guys hustling and playing well. I think [Porzingis] probably figures he’s going to be a starter. I figure he’s going to be a starter, too. But after that you don’t know.”\nEmail: popper@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:31.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
