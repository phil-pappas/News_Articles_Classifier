We didn’t have that fight.” \nLeading 12-6 in the fifth set, the Cardinals completely collapsed down the stretch — allowing nine straight points to Sheboygan North and giving the Raiders the win. \nMollie Tennessen led Fond du Lac with 12 kills and Emily Thompson had 21 assists. Megan Wendt chipped in with 27 digs and four aces. \nLauren Wirtz added 20 digs. \nLeading 2-0 after a dramatic 26-24 win in the second set, the Cardinals blew a 17-14 lead in the third to allow Sheboygan North to stay alive and then gave up a 20-17 lead in the fourth. \nMeanwhile, with its comeback, Sheboygan North will travel to face top-seeded Cedarburg in a regional final match on Saturday. \nAlthough it was a disappointing end, Santry was happy with what his team accomplished and how hard it worked in 2015. \n“The girls worked hard,” he said. “They worked harder than any other team that I’ve been affiliated with. We’ve asked a lot of them and they responded well. They should be proud of all the things we accomplished this year.” \nSheboygan North def. Fond du Lac 3-2 (16-25, 24-26, 25-23, 25-22, 15-12) \nStat Leaders: Fond du Lac — Mollie Tennessen, 12 kills; Emily Thompson, 21 assists; Lauren Wirtz, 20 digs; Megan Wendt, 27 digs, 4 aces. \nSam Oleson: (920) 907-7930, soleson@gannett.com or follow on Twitter @sam_olesonFDL 4 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1LQvLUY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:26:50.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
