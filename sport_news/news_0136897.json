Your forecast: You won’t be doing cartwheels after reading the weather forecast for the start of the week, but we think you’re going to love how it ends. Expect a mostly cloudy Monday with a high of 8 C, followed by a pair of rainy days Tuesday and Wednesday, with temperatures reaching 9 C and just 3 C, respectively. But the sunshine returns Thursday with a projected daytime high of 6 C. The Halloween weekend looks anything but spooky, with lots of blue sky and daytime temperatures ranging from 7 C to 11 C Friday through Sunday. In case you missed it Canadian Coast Guard crew arrive at a dock in Tofino, B.C., early Monday morning following a search and rescue operation on Sunday involving a whale watching boat that capsized near Vancouver Island. Five dead as B.C. boat sinks: Five people didn’t survive and one person is still missing after a Vancouver Island whale-watching vessel capsized, sending 27 people into the ocean water. Various sources, including the Transportation Safety Board and the area’s newly elected MP, identified the boat as the Leviathan II, a 20-metre vessel belonging to the local whale-watching outfit Jamie’s Whaling Station. An employee of the company who answered the phone would not take any questions. It happened around 4 p.m. off the coast of Tofino. Local First Nations people and other whale-watching tour boats were the first to respond to the mayday call. How many are homeless: Dougie Bruce didn’t let his volunteer census-taker get one question in Sunday night before his entire life story came out. Bruce, who said he was born in 1970 and became homeless at age 12, was one of the first wave of people to sit down for Winnipeg’s first-ever homeless street census. The 24-hour blitz began at downtown shelters with the 300 volunteers, armed with granola bars and smokes to offer as thank-you gifts, asking a series of 19 simple questions to as many shelter clients as they could. The census, called a point-in-time count, mirrors others done all over the United States. In order to access the former Conservative government’s new $600-million round of homelessness funding, cities across Canada must conduct their own counts this year. Search continues for Krull: At daybreak, Bill McCausland and his wife Robin awoke to resume the search for Thelma Krull, the Winnipeg woman who has been missing since the summer. Krull, 57, was last seen on Saturday, July 11 at 7:23 a.m. when she left her Harbourview South home for a morning hike. McCausland, his wife Robin, along with Sandra Jurkovic and her daughter, Brenda Gates, have been tireless in their efforts, searching two or three times a week, without finding a single clue to Krull’s disappearance. On Sunday, the four headed beyond the Perimeter Highway because they believe that “People just don’t disappear. Thelma’s got to be someplace.” Up next Arlington Bridge Bridge reopens: Arlington Bridge was scheduled to reopen at 6 a.m. today after it was temporarily closed for inspection and maintenance that couldn’t be done while vehicles were driving. The bridge, which goes over the Canadian Pacific Railway yards from Logan Avenue to Dufferin Avenue, offers a geometrically striking view of myriad rail tracks converging to the horizon. It’s a reminder of Winnipeg’s historic claim as a hub of rail transportation. Stalwart citizens: Manitoba Public Insurance has declared today begins the 14th annual Citizens on Patrol Week. There are 1,700 Manitobans who volunteer their time to this program each year to keep their communities safe through crime prevention initiatives. For examples, volunteers display speed-reader boards, patrol at school crossing zones, identify impaired drivers, and conduct seatbelt and cellphone use surveys in conjunction with the RCMP. Cop back in court: The trial of a Toronto police officer charged in the shooting death of a teen on an empty streetcar on July 26, 2013 is set to resume today in the Ontario city. Const. James Forcillo has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and attempted murder in the death of 18-year-old Sammy Yatim. Last week, jurors watched videos and heard audio recordings of the confrontation that ended Yatim's life. Chad Seymour, the streetcar driver who remained with the knife-wielding teen as panicked passengers fled the vehicle in fear, is expected to testify today. Around the water cooler Lewis Koski, left, chief investigator of the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division. Beware the weed: A Colorado official has some sobering words of advice for Justin Trudeau if he fulfills his promise to legalize pot in Canada. Lewis Koski, director of the state’s Marijuana Enforcement Division, said, “It’s going to be a lot harder to implement than you think. It’s going to take a lot longer to do it. And it’s going to cost more than you think.” Colorado is one of four U.S. states to fully legalize marijuana. Their challenges — including how to regulate edibles such as brownies and cookies and a rise in drug-impaired driving — could be instructive for Canada’s incoming prime minister. Jets barely hold on: It goes down as another two points gained, but the Winnipeg Jets’ 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Wild was anything but easy. The Jets blew a 5-1 lead Sunday at the MTS Centre but managed to escape with a win, raising their record to 5-2-1. Minnesota’s Jason Zucker scored 10 seconds into the game, the Jets soared back with the next five goals and then allowed three to the Wild to give the sold-out Winnipeg crowd fits. The Jets host the Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday night. Trending now A patient is brought to a hospital after severe earthquake was felt in Mingora, the main town of Pakistan Swat valley, Monday.

Strong tremors were felt in Kabul, New Delhi and Islamabad on Monday. #Earthquake: Twelve schoolgirls in Taloqan, Afghanistan were killed in a stampede when trying to escape a massive earthquake hit the region. Another 30 girls in the city have been taken to hospital, and people across the region are recovering from the effects of the quake. #MySignificantOtherIn4Words: People are posting pithy pronouncements on their SOs, which for some also includes their cat, because the Internet. From the touching (\"Such a Great Father\"), to the political (\"Thoughtful Bernie Sanders Supporter\"), to the feline, one hopes (\"Uses the litter box\"), many are showing brevity is the soul of wit, or at least, blunt honesty.
