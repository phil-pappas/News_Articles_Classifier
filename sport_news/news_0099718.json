WVU starts season off on right foot at State Games By Roger Turner TheDAOnline.com | 0 comments \nWest Virginia men's and women's swimming and diving teams started the 2015-16 season off victorious, sweeping the first day of the West Virginia State Games in both the men's and women's events. \nThursday marked the first day of competition for the Mountaineers, who participated in the State Games for the fifth consecutive year. As the Mountaineers aim for their fifth victory in the state meet, the first day for both teams matched expectations for the season to come. \"It was a strong night for both teams. Winning 1, 2, and 3 in diving definitely helped the women going into tomorrow,\" said head coach Vic Riggs. \"The energy level was great tonight, and the teams were excited to start the season.\" For the women's side, Thursday's events played in favor of the Mountaineers, especially for the relay teams, which showed promise in their first meet of 2015. \nSenior Jamie Gillmore came away victorious in three events, two of which were relays. Relay competition for the women's team opened the season with first and third performances in the 200 freestyle relay. Gillmore, accompanied by swimmers Amelie Currat, Maggie Miller, and Georgia Baldus, finished with a first-place time of 1:37.71 in Thursday's opening night 200 relay event. Marshall placed second behind the Mountaineers in the event. To conclude the night, the women's 400 medley team placed second in the opening day's relay event. Courtney Miller, Emma Harris, and seniors Natalie Johnsen and Jaimee Gillmore finished with a time of 3:55.73. Gillmore also came away with an individual victory in the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 24.29. Mariah Berger finished in first place for the 200 individual medley, recording a time of 2:09.35 in her first meet of the season. Johnsen also placed for the WVU women in the event, finishing with a time of 2:11.85. \nThe West Virginia men's team finished with a prime performance, holding true to last year's form in the State Games. Senior Chase Williams finished first, coming in with a time of 1:56.56 to lead the team. The Mountaineers came away with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd finishes in the event, with swimmers Max Spencer and Austin Green coming in behind Williams. \nThe West Virginia men's kept up the sweep in the 50-yard freestyle event, as WVU swimmers Andrew Marsh, Ross Glegg, and Nate Carr finished with top three honors in the event. In the 400 medley relay event, the WVU men's team came away with first and second place finishes to conclude their first day of competition. The team consisting of Marsh, Glegg, Williams, and Max Spencer finished close to seven seconds ahead of second place. Going forward from the season’s first day of competition, the Mountaineers will look to build off the 1-2-3 finishes in the 11 events completed on Thursday. \n\"Both teams had strong swims from upperclassmen and we saw some bright spots from our freshmen,\" Riggs said. This year's West Virginia State Games will reconvene today with events beginning at 11 a.m. Tomorrow's events will conclude with 14 swimming events, and 12 more events happening at 4 p.m. \n\"Tomorrow is a long day and we'll need to stay focused and make sure we prepare for each race one at a time,\" Riggs said. \nTomorrow’s events will also be open and available to students and the public at the WVU Natatorium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:58:32.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
