With Messi out injured, Brazil striker Neymar is looking to prove he has what it takes to finally make the final three. \nThe winners of Ballon d’Or and Coach of the Year will be announced Jan. 11. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:06:27.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
