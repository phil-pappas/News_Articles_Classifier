(Image Source: Gary Hershorn/AP Photo) \nAround the NFL in Week 6: \n-The Passers – Rodgers, Rivers & Newton: \nIn Green Bay, Packers QB Aaron Rodgers threw for 255 yards and two TDs (no INTs) with a 107.7 passer rating in a 27-20 win over the San Diego Chargers. Rodgers now has over 30,000 passing yards and he got there in 3,652 attempts, which is the fewest to 30,000, breaking the previous mark set by Hall of Famer Johnny Unitas (3,695). \nIn the same game, San Diego QB Philip Rivers was 43 of 65 for 503 yards and two TDs (no INTs) for a passer rating of 99.7. With 43 completions, 65 attempts and 503 passing yards, Rivers set single-game franchise records. It was also his 150 th straight career start, making Rivers only the fourth quarterback to start 150 games in a row, joining Brett Favre , Peyton Manning and Eli Manning . \nWhile Aaron Rodgers and Philip Rivers do most (if not all in the case of the latter) of their damage with their arms, the Carolina Panthers Cam Newton is a vintage dual-threat quarterback. In Carolina’s 27-23 upset win at the Seattle Seahawks, Newton scored on the ground and threw the game-winning TD pass with 32 seconds left in the game. It was the third time this season and the 27 th time in his career that Newton had a passing and rushing TD in the same game, which trails only Steve Young (31 such games) in the history of the NFL. \n-The Pass-Catchers – Hopkins, Bryant & Marshall: \nThe Houston Texans beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 31-20 with a big effort from WR DeAndre Hopkins , who is emerging into a true No. 1 wide out. Hopkins caught 10 passes for 148 yards and two scores. That’s coming off a nine-catch, 157-yard game at Atlanta in Week 4 and an 11-catch, 169-yard effort against Indianapolis in Week 5. With Sunday’s big game, Hopkins became the first player in NFL history with nine-plus catches and at least 145 receiving yards in three straight games. \nFellow Clemson product, Pittsburgh Steelers WR Martavis Bryant caught six balls for 137 yards, including an 88-yard scoring strike as the Steelers knocked off the Arizona Cardinals. As a rookie, Bryant had a 94-yard TD catch against the Cincinnati Bengals, making him just the second player in league history to have two TD receptions of at least 88 yards in both his rookie year and his second season. Chicago Cardinal Gus Tinsley did it in 1937-38. \nBoth DeAndre Hopkins and Martavis Bryant are emerging pass catchers coming through for the teams that drafted them. In the offseason, the New York Jets knew what they were getting when they traded for Brandon Marshall and he has not disappointed. Marshall caught seven passes for 111 yards and a score, as the Jets beat the Washington Redskins 34-20. He is the first Jet with four straight 100-yard receiving games since Hall of Famer Don Maynard did in it 1968. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
