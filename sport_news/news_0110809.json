He threw and caught passes in a relaxed mode in the brief time he was on the field when practice was still opened to the media.\nIn the end, he only did rehab stuff, as he did on Wednesday, and did not participate in practice.\nBryant's status for Sunday's game against the New York Giants remains unknown, but signs are suggesting he will not play.\nWhile coach Jason Garrett has said he wants Bryant to participate in practice before returning to game action, he is not ruling him out.\n\"We're not ruling anybody out,\" Garrett said. \"We take him day by day. We take him all the way to the game. Really what we're doing is focusing on his work today and see how he handles it.\"\nGarrett said that Bryant has been able to cut and run during his rehab.\n\"There's obviously degrees to that, how well are you running, how well are you cutting, how do you respond to that work,\" Garrett said. \"Not unlike the other injuries that you have, guys coming back off of these things all the time. And you kind of put them through different things to see how they handle it, see how functional they are and see if you can take them to the next step where they get involved in a competitive practice.\"\nBryant, 26, has been sidelined since the season opener when he fractured the fifth metatarsal in his right foot. He had surgery, which included a bone graft, on Sept. 14.\nThe initial timeline for Bryant's return had been six to eight weeks, and this Sunday is just shy of the six-week mark. So the Cowboys are walking a fine line to make sure they don't rush Bryant back too soon.\nOffensive coordinator Scott Linehan said if the Cowboys gave him the go-ahead for Sunday that he would find a way to use him.\n(c)2015 Fort Worth Star-Telegram\nVisit the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at www.star-telegram.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742063&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742063&h=Cowboys+not+ruling+out+Dez+Bryant%2C+but+signs+suggest+he+won%27t+play", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742063"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:15:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
