The water main has been repaired and service to the area has been restored, officials said, but residents should still boil their water before drinking it or using it to prepare food. Water used for such purposes should be brought to a rolling boil for at least five minutes. Officials said the boil order will remain in effect until quality samples confirm the water is safe for consumption. They said the water is fine for bathing, washing and other uses. The order does not apply to residents in those areas who receive their water from municipalities. It's standard procedure for a boil water order to be in effect for 36 hours after water service is restored. Customers are being notified via the media, customer calls, and Illinois American Water website updates at www.illinoisamwater.com .
