Greeks win the Battle of Marathon about 25 miles from Athens. Greeks send the messenger Pheidippides to run to Athens to proclaim the victory. He does so, and then dies. (When told of this story the great Frank Shorter commented, \"He wasn't getting in his hundred miles a week.\")\nBut there's more to it, most of which we know from the great historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus, who wrote a nine-book account of the Persian Wars, the long struggle between the small Greek city-states and the powerful Persians who occupied most of the known world at the time. The war began at Marathon and ended 11 years later in 479 B.C. Greeks won.\nLet's rewind and go back to the days preceding the Battle of Marathon. The Athenians had a great navy but not a strong infantry, so they sent Pheidippides to run from Athens to Sparta, a distance of over 150 miles, to ask the Spartans to help them out. Spartans had the chops to fight hard but no real interest in helping their northern neighbors, so Pheidippides had to run all the way back to Athens and deliver the bad news.\nBut there's a catch. Herodotus tells of Pheidippides as the valiant runner who accomplished the Sparta leg and back based on eyewitness accounts, but he makes no mention of the Marathon run, so we may assume the Marathon part of the story is apocryphal. (Browning wrote a poem about it, the story loosely derived from a vague account by Lucian and later Plutarch.)\nNow fast forward to 1982, when John Foden and four other RAF officers tried to test if it were possible to run from Athens to Sparta in a day and a half, which Foden achieved with a time of 37:37. This accomplishment led to the beginning of the Spartathlon in 1983, an annual race of about 153 miles.\nI have been hoping for a reason to write about this incredibly difficult ultra-marathon for years, but I've not had a good reason to until last week when my friend Bob Hearn not only finished the grueling event in 29:35, but was the first U.S. male runner and the third overall finisher 50 years or older. What a sensational achievement.\nThis year only 174 of the 380 entrants finished the race, which is usually how it goes. It's incredibly difficult beyond just the distance. There are mountains to climb, heat to fight, sun to avoid, and to make it even harder, a huge number of time checkpoints the runner must hit in order not to be pulled from the race.\nBut Hearn, a native Oklahoman with a short stay in Texas for his undergrad degree at Rice and now living in Portola Valley, CA, was undeterred, well-trained and strong, running the long downhill stretch to the finish in 8:30's.\nHe wrote, \"After the last turn, coming down the final quarter mile was unbelievably emotional. I had imagined this so many times, read so many race reports, seen so many photos. Finally, here I was. The city was cheering, pulling me in, sharing in my triumph. Where is King Leonidas? Finally, the view opened, and there he was. I had made it. I sprang up the steps with a huge grin, and kissed his foot. Done!\"\nWhat a great life achievement for Bob, one of the most popular runners in the country. I'm proud to know him and to tell you the story today. Please Google \"Spartathlon\" and learn more about this fascinating race and the history behind it.\nBob Hearn, American Pheidippides!\nSpareribs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:53:45.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
