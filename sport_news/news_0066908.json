BOYS SOCCER: Norwell holds off Brockton Norwell hands Brockton its first loss of the season on Saturday, 3-2. Comment The Patriot Ledger, Quincy, MA Greg Dudek Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 6:46 PM Updated at 6:53 PM Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 6:46 PM Updated at 6:53 PM NORWELL It was bound to occur. And as the old adage goes, it’s better it happened now than in the postseason. The Brockton High boys soccer team lost for the first time this season on Saturday afternoon, as Norwell got on top early at home and hung on late to win, 3-2, knocking the Boxers from the undefeated ranks. “We didn’t come out sharp,” said Brockton head coach Rick Robens. “(Norwell) deserved the result they got. Our boys did not come out ready. Credit to them. They worked hard and capitalized on their opportunities.” Norwell (13-2-1) put the pressure on Brockton (12-1-2) right from the start with senior forwards Harry Davis and Jack Dwyer getting off good shots in the early going, but were turned away by senior goalkeeper Michael Cruz (seven saves). But, in the eighth minute, Dwyer snuck behind the Boxerss’ defense in the box and buried a shot into the back of the net for a 1-0 lead. The Clippers extended their advantage in the 23rd minute to 2-0 with sophomore Matt Cawthorne putting home a rebound after Cruz made the initial stop on a shot by freshman William Anastos. “Defensively we were sloppy,” Robens said. “Not getting goal-side. Hoping that they weren’t going to get the ball. When you don’t work hard, that stuff happens.” Norwell took the lead into halftime, but Brockton tried to engineer a comeback after the break. The Boxers cut into the deficit, 2-1, in the 47th minute when senior midfielder and captain John Santos knocked in a shot from the goal line after senior Bruno Martins’ header from a cross deflected off a Norwell defender right to Santos. The Clippers stayed tough, though, and responded a little under five minutes later as Davis got past a defender and dished a pass off to Dwyer, who deposited a shot for his second goal of the game and a 3-1 lead. “(Davis) is a nice striker,” Robens said. “He’s a good player. You have to keep an eye on someone like that. Credit to him. He was dangerous and beat us down the wing.” Brockton didn’t go away, though, answering with 17:10 remaining in regulation as senior forward Camden Frederick scored to make it a one-goal game, 3-2. The Boxers then went into full attack mode, searching for the equalizer. They almost got it a minute after Frederick’s goal when a cross into the box went off a Norwell defender and headed toward the goal, but went off the post and back out. Brockton kept on pushing for the tying goal near the end of regulation, but with the Clippers’ defense packing it in and senior goalkeeper Jack Dole (seven saves) playing well in-between the pipes, the Boxers couldn’t find the back of the net, sealing a Norwell win. Page 2 of 2 - “It seemed like an eternity,” said Norwell head coach Jack Browne of the final minutes. “A couple times we’re up by two goals and then they would come back. Against Brockton, you’re not comfortable with a three-goal lead. And to think now it’s down to one, it was like ‘Oh, goodness.’” For the Boxers, they will have to regroup after their first loss and will have a chance to do so with five games left in the regular season. “It’s a wake-up call for us,” Robens said. “I’m hoping we take this and learn from it.” Follow Greg Dudek on Twitter @gdudek10.
