Strategy did not suit Inland market, analysts say (March 23, 2015)\nNearly eight years after crossing the Atlantic Ocean in hopes of shaking up the Inland grocery scene, Fresh & Easy supermarket is checking out for the last time.\nThe British-conceived chain, which made its U.S. debut in Hemet, plans to close or sell its remaining 100 stores, including nine in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, officials announced Wednesday. Two Fresh & Easy distribution facilities in the Riverside area also will close.\nThe Torrance-based chain will close its doors in the next few weeks, company spokesman Brendan Wonnacott said in an email. About 3,000 employees were sent layoff notices Wednesday.\n“Over the last two years, we have been working hard to build a new Fresh & Easy,” he said. “While we made progress on stemming our losses and moving the business closer to break even, unfortunately we have been unable to obtain financing and the liquidity necessary to continue to fund the business going forward. As we start the process for an organized wind-down of the business, we continue to work to sell all or part of the business.”\nLaunched by British retail giant Tesco, Fresh & Easy boasted a strong Inland presence, rapidly expanding through the region even as the Great Recession crippled the economy.\nBut analysts said the chain charged too much and offered too little variety to build a sufficient customer base.\nYucaipa Cos., owned by billionaire supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, bought most of Fresh & Easy operations after it sought protection from creditors in 2012. The chain filed for bankruptcy protection after losing millions of dollars on the concept.\n‘GOOD JOBS’\n“It’s too bad to see the company apparently not be able to conform to the way American markets work,” said local economist John Husing. “Those were good jobs and of the kind we need a lot of in this region. Apparently, the market is too competitive and they just couldn’t make it.”\nIn April, the company announced plans to close half of its then-16 grocery outlets in western Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The number of stores in California, Arizona and Nevada dwindled from more than 160 to 110.\nThe nine remaining Inland stores are in Calimesa, Cathedral City, Fontana, Murrieta, Palm Springs, Riverside, San Jacinto, Temecula and Yucaipa.\nAs Fresh & Easy puts its locations on the market, possible suitors could be discount markets Aldi and Grocery Outlet. Aldi has a five-year plan to open 650 stores across the country. Inland locations expected to open between March and July include Beaumont, Fontana, La Quinta, Lake Elsinore, Menifee, Moreno Valley, Palm Desert, Palm Springs, San Bernardino and Yucaipa. The company also plans a regional headquarters and warehouse in Moreno Valley.\nHusing said the time may not be right for Aldi or another grocer to snap up the closing Fresh & Easy stores.\n“While the recovery is underway, the one area that hasn’t recovered that much is hiring in retail,” he said. “I’m not so sure that anyone is going to need to step into that slot for now.”\nNews of the closure didn’t come as a shock to the San Jacinto store’s 20 employees, manager Kevin Beltran said by phone.\n“ Things were looking bleak and scary on the shelves,” he said. “We had vendor issues that set us back. All of a sudden we got emails saying Coca-Cola couldn’t deliver because we didn’t pay the bill. Breads, coffee creamers, very popular brands, started not showing up. That’s how you saw the writing on the wal l.”\nBeltran said he was “sad and disheartened” because the store had a loyal following of customers who have few grocery options in the area.\n“We love the store and we love our people,” he said.\nBefore the official announcement, he didn’t know what to tell shoppers who asked about the empty shelves.\n“Now at least there’s some resolution,” he said. “At least I can be up front and say, ‘I’m sorry; we’re closing your favorite store. We’re going through a grieving process, us and the community together.”\nHELP FOR WORKERS\nRiverside County Workforce Development Centers plan to offer free help to laid-off workers at the two Fresh & Easy distribution facilities in the Riverside area that also are closing. They can sign up to get unemployment benefits, receive help writing résumés and make follow-up appointments to talk to counselors. Dates and times have not been announced.\nC ustomers shopping at the Fresh & Easy on Trautwein Avenue in Riverside on Wednesday afternoon said they were surprised and saddened by the new s.\n“I think it’s just terrible,” said Maurice Bauer, a Riverside resident. “They have some items that are difficult to find somewhere else.”\nBauer said he shops regularly at the store to pick up specialty items such as certain cheeses and Italian meats.\nRonnie Aguilera, who also lives in Riverside, was shopping with her daughter Alexa Aguilera. The mother said she shops there once a week and likes how the store is designed to make it easy to shop quickly.\n“I like that’s it’s not your typical grocery store,” said Alexa Aguilera, citing the healthful foods with fresh ingredients offered.\nRonnie Aguilera said she knew of other stores that closed but hoped the Riverside location was safe.\n“I was hoping they would stay open,” she said.\nHowever, she had noticed in the past few months that some items no longer were being carried by the store.\nS hopping at the nearby Ralphs on Mission Grove, Linda Williams of Riverside said she was also disappointed to hear of the store closin g.\n“I better go get my favorite stuff,” she said.\nShe said Fresh & Easy is one of the grocery stores she frequents, along with Sprouts and Ralphs.\n“Each one has their own special thing,” Williams said.\nStaff writers Nancy Luna� and Hannah Madans� contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:16:08.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
