Villaruel   October 1, 2015 - 12:00am \nCEBU, Philippines - League giants University of the Visayas Green Lancers and the University of San Carlos Warriors seek no less than a finals berth when they take on each other in the semifinals of the 15th Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc. men's basketball tournament today at the Cebu Coliseum. \nAside from kicking off their semis campaigns in resounding fashion, the Lancers and the Warriors also carry an even 1-1 head-to-head record during the classification stage, making their third bout of the season more exciting. \nThe Warriors drew first blood, 79-69, last August 23, but the Lancers bounced back in style courtesy of a 74-43 massacre of USC during their September 20 rematch. \nNow that they're even steven, the Lancers and the Warriors are expected to figure in another highly-charged battle as they take on the floor at 6:45 p.m. \nThe showdown of imports Steve Cedrick Akomo of UV and Shooter Olago of USC will again be the main highlight of their encounter, but the outcome for sure will hinge on how they draw support from their local comrades. \nFor the Lancers of coach Gary Cortes, they can rely on their quadruple punch of Leonard Santillan, Franz Arong, Alfred Codilla and June Kent Manzo. They also have on their side Jerome Napao, Josue Segumpan, Arvin Aguirre, Arvie Cabanero, Rey Suerte, and Vincent Mendoza who can contribute well on both ends.   \nThe Warriors boast of an equally-talented roster, yet they still got thrashed by a mind-boggling 31 points by the Lancers during their previous meeting. They must have figured out by now why they lost by such a wide margin to their fiercest rivals for the coveted throne this season. \nAs they try to erase some doubts, the Britt Reroma-mentored Warriors must squeeze the most from their vast arsenal of gunners in Ian Tagapan, Charles Pepito, Nico Magat, Victor Rabat, Ian Ortega and William McAloney among others. \nMeanwhile, the heavily undermanned Southwestern University Cobras and the University of San Jose-Recoletos Jaguars fight for dear life as they collide in the opening match at 5:15 p.m. (FREEMAN)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:33:06.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
