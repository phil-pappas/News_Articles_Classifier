And he said Wednesday that the Rams have tried to get the ball to Cartwright more, but the tight end hasn’t always gotten open or made the catch when the ball has come his way. A pass on the first play of overtime in a loss to the University of Colorado hit Cartwright, who never turned around to look for the ball, in the back of the leg. \n“We’re going to find a way to win the ballgame, and whatever way I feel that can get us that way, and if it’s tight ends, receivers, just running the ball, that’s what we’re going to do,” Bobo said. \n“I think awards happen when you have team success. If you win, then people win awards. If you don’t win, they usually don’t win awards.” \nCartwright and CSU teammate Steven Walker, an All-Mountain West tight end in 2014 when Cartwright was sidelined with an ankle injury, were both named to the preseason watch list for the Mackey Award. \nCartwright is one of 35 players on the midseason list. Walker, who has five catches for 72 yards, is not on the list. \nCartwright has 67 career catches for 1,035 yards and 10 TDs. He also was on the midseason watch list for the award in 2013. \nHIGGINS MISSES PRACTICE: Star receiver Rashard Higgins has missed several days of practice because of an illness, Bobo said. Higgins, a consensus All-American and one of three finalists for the Biletnikoff Award as the nation’s outstanding receiver a year ago, is the Rams’ leading receiver with 34 catches for 469 yards and four touchdowns. \nBobo said Higgins hasn’t practiced since last Thursday, but receivers coach Alvis Whitted said Wednesday he expects Higgins to play Saturday against Air Force. \nSenior Joe Hansley, the Rams’ second-leading receiver with 15 catches for 197 yards and three touchdowns, missed practice Tuesday with an illness. \nFULL HOUSE? CSU officials are expecting a sellout crowd of more than 32,500 for Saturday’s homecoming game at Hughes Stadium. All seats for the general public sold out last week, prompting the university to put up to 1,000 standing-room only tickets on sale. A handful of those remained Wednesday, as did about 3,000 of the 10,000 tickets set aside for students, a school spokesman said. \nODDS ARE: Air Force is a 3-point favorite over CSU, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers who post their betting lines at VegasInsider.com. It was listed as a “pick ‘em” game at the beginning of the week, with neither team getting points. \nFollow reporter Kelly Lyell at twitter.com/KellyLyell and facebook.com/KellyLyell.news Read or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1RJ2qg5 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:10:31.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
