The 20-year-old mall is managed by Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group and has leased space to tenants such as Brown Mackie College and The Indianapolis Star newspaper to fill vacancies. Simon executive David Contis tells the Star that the company is considering adding apartments or condos to the two-square-block complex, but hasn't made decisions. Other possible overhauls include adding and improving entrances to better draw in passers-by, new lighting and seating and upgrading the food court and restrooms. Sherry Seiwert of the Downtown Indy promotion group tells the Indianapolis Business Journal that the plans could boost the mall's appeal to downtown's growing residential population.
