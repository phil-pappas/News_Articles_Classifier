(AP) - Student senators at the University of Mississippi have voted to ask the school administration to remove the Mississippi flag from campus because it contains a Confederate battle emblem that some say is an offensive reminder of slavery and segregation.\nThe vote Tuesday night by the Associated Student Body senate is nonbinding. Administrators on the Oxford campus will consider it later.\nSince 1894, the Mississippi flag has had the Confederate battle emblem in the upper left corner - a blue X with 13 white stars, over a field of red. Residents chose to keep the flag during a 2001 statewide vote.\nHowever, the public display of Confederate symbols has been subject to heated debates since the June massacre of nine black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
