But this weather is coming back under an upper level pattern that we have seen many times and this pattern has left KELOLAND with a wide range of highs. \nLet's take January 27th, 2015 for example. The upper level flow over the Midwest was from the northwest to the southeast. And this pattern affected the daily high on this day. \nHighs in the west were warmer, reaching comfortable 60s and 70s in the middle of winter while the east had it a bit colder but still above average for time of year, highs reaching the 30s and 40s. \nAnd this week, a similar pattern is setting up, with flow from the northwest to the southeast. One difference is the air to our east won't be as cold as the air was in January. \nThis difference means the highs this week won't be quite as extreme, but still noticeable. But as long as we keep seeing this flow from the eastern Pacific, the cold, arctic air just sitting to our north will stay at bay. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
