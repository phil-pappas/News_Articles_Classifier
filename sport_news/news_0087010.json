Swimmers compete against each other in the Blue vs. White meet. The Cougars kicked off the regular season at the Colorado Mesa Invite. (Universe Archives) \nThe BYU swim and dive team kicked off the season today in Grand Junction at the Colorado Mesa Invitational. \n“Our team really swam well today and I liked the effort they gave,” BYU head coach John Brooks said in a press release following the meet. “Overall, I think our team is getting better and better with each meet. Each week we are working on things, and it’s paying off. We are improving from last year individually and as a team as well.” \nThe men’s team performed well, beating Colorado Mesa but were edged out by Air Force. The women’s team beat both Colorado Mesa and Colorado State. \nSeveral Cougars took first in their individual events including senior Jake Taylor. Taylor finished first in the 100-yard individual medley and 200-yard backstroke. Junior Ranier Ng also had a great weekend by placing first in both the 200 and 100-yard butterfly events. \nThe women’s team had swimmers place first, second and third in three events Friday night. The Cougars swept the 100-yard butterfly, the 200-yard butterfly and the 500-yard freestyle with Ellie Thornbrue, Lilian Moore and Kelly Hatanaka each placing first respectively. \nThe men’s diving team placed first and second on both the one-meter dive and the three-meter dive. Kevin Dreeson placed first and Trayton Speth took second in the one-meter dive. \nAli Tippetts-Kottcamp finished second in the women’s three-meter dive while Kaela Call tied for third. \nBYU swim and dive will travel to Stockton, CA for the Pacific Invite on Oct. 23-24.
