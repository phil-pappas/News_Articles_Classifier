Russellville cobbled together 82 yards of total offense, with only three yards coming from 16 carries on the ground.The Bulldogs racked up 256 yards total offense, 126 on the ground and 130 through the air — a balanced attack the Cyclones struggled to stop.Russellville marched down the field on its second possession, but a fumble by Cole McKown on the Greenwood 35-yard line put the Bulldogs back on the field.One play later — a 78-yard touchdown strike — Greenwood added insult to injury to go up 7-0 with 4:17 left in the first quarter.The Cyclones squandered their next possession, and the Bulldogs took advantage. Greenwood moved the ball 65 yards in nine plays to go up 14-0 with 11:55 left in the half. The Bulldogs set the halftime score with 1:17 to go with a plodding, 99-yard, 11-play drive to make it 21-0.Greenwood picked up where they left off in the third quarter — well, almost. Russellville stuffed the Bulldogs on their opening possession and set up shop on its own 45-yard line. Jackson Hickey tore of 15 yards on three consecutive rushes, before Ryan Talley connected with Ryan Meador on a 13-yard pass play. Hickey broke off five more yards, but Talley was sacked for a loss of 13 yards two plays later. A delay of game penalty made it fourth-and-23 and brought out the punt team.Greenwood drove deep into Russellville territory, but a tipped pass landed in the arms of James Woods and gave the Cyclones possession on their own 10. Hickey broke loose on a 44-yard run, but a fumble on the next snap was recovered by the Bulldogs.Greenwood, quick to capitalize, scored two plays later — a 47-yard touchdown pass to make it 28-0 with 3:27 left in the third.Russellville took over on its own 33. Hickey tore off 11 yards. Meador hauled in a pass for nine. Talley broke free for 20 yards, but a deep pass was intercepted to end the series.Greenwood again didn’t hesitate. Eight plays later they crossed the goal line to make it 35-0 with 10:58 left in the game.Talley finished the night 14-of-20 for 77 yards and one interception. Cale Fulsom was 5-of-11 for 30 yards. Hickey had 101 yards on 16 carries. Meador finished with 52 yards on 11 catches.The Cyclones will travel to Little Rock Catholic on Friday.
