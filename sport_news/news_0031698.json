He then broke the game open with a three-run blast in the sixth.\n\"I felt like the first game I swung the bat well, just not (getting) results,\" he said. \"It was only a matter of two games. Just stick with it and you know it will come around. I just kept battling, which I've done all year, and it worked out.\"\nTulowitzki's output was more than enough support for Toronto right-hander Marco Estrada, who pitched 6 1/3 innings, allowing just five hits and one run. He struck out four and didn't walk a batter. The Rangers didn't have a baserunner until third baseman Hanser Alberto hit a two-out double in the bottom of the third inning.\nBy that time, the Blue Jays already scratched for a run against left-hander Martin Perez, with catcher Dioner Navarro scoring on a double-play grounder in the third inning.\nThe Blue Jays doubled the advantage in the fourth when Tulowitzki drew an RBI walk. Perez struggled with his command after two perfect innings to open the game. He ended up walking three and allowing four runs on six hits before getting pulled after allowing back-to-back hits to open the sixth inning.\nTexas manager Jeff Banister opted to go with rookie right-hander Chi Chi Gonzalez after Perez exited. Gonzalez got two outs in the innings before Tulowitzki came up with runners on second third and changed the game for good.\n\"These guys did a really good job of limiting the damage and got the double plays when they needed to,\" said Banister, whose team stayed close thanks to four double plays in the first six innings. \"The really big blow was the changeup to Tulowitzki that in that situation probably you'd like to stay with your best pitch with a base (open). But the margin for error in these types of games is so slim that one pitch typically can get you, and that really was the story of Chi Chi in that situation.\"\nEstrada, who won 13 games for the Blue Jays in the regular season, never faced those kinds of problems.\n\"He was unbelievable,\" Toronto manager John Gibbons said. \"But I've got to tell you, he's been doing that all year. Do-or-die game, it doesn't surprise me. He stepped up. You could tell early on he was on. It was a job well done, but he's been doing it all year.\"\nThe Rangers scored their lone run in the seventh on an grounder from second baseman Rougned Odor.\n\"(Estrada) has been tough the whole year,\" said Texas shortstop Elvis Andrus , who went 1-for-4 and scored the team's lone run. \"He did it again. The angle, over the top, and he always likes to throw high fastballs, and he has an extremely good changeup and curveball. So it was his day. We knew it wasn't going to be easy.\"\nTulowitzki, third baseman Josh Donaldson and center fielder Ryan Pillar collected two hits apiece for Toronto. Left fielder Josh Hamilton finished with two of Texas' five hits.\nNOTES: Texas LF Josh Hamilton snapped an 0-for-31 postseason slump with a fifth-inning single.
