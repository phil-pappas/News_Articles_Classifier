With the victory, Menard remained undefeated on the season at 6-0 head into its first district road contest against the third-ranked Many Tigers. Rosepine, which will host Oakdale for homecoming at McKee-McCain Stadium on Oct. 16, dropped to 1-5 overall, 0-1 in district. “Menard is a solid team, very fundamental,” Rosepine head coach Danny Cain said. “They are a sound team.” Menard racked up 491 yards of total offense, throwing for 253 yards, while rushing for 238 yards. Morrison completed 9-of-11 passes for 233 yards and a career-high five touchdowns. The homestanding Eagles opened the scoring with a 21-yard TD pass from Morrison to Adam Brown. With the Heath Hilton PAT, Menard had a 7-0 lead. A little later, Morrison found Bryce Bordelon on a 15-yard scoring toss as Menard owned a 14-0 lead at the end of the first period. Menard put five touchdowns on the board in the second period to build a 49-0 lead at the break. David Christmas scored on an 8-yard TD run, while David Christmas had a 15-yard touchdown scamper to push the lead to 28-0. Morrison connected with Brown on a 66-yard TD pass, before finding Alex Antoon on scoring tosses of 36 and 37 yards as Menard went into the intermission with a huge lead, much to the delight of the homecoming crowd, 49-0. Menard scored twice more in the third period, getting a safety and a 10-yard TD run by Roman Armstrong to cap the scoring. Rosepine managed just 91 yards of offense in the game and had several players playing out of position due to a rash of injuries. “Take nothing away from Menard, but we are hurting from all of the injuries we have,” Cain said. “We have so many kids playing out of their normal position. And that’s no fault of the kids. They are playing hard, but we have to move them around so much, they are just out of position.” Covey Landen had 57 yards rushing on six carries to lead the Eagles, while Lawrence Willis reeled in four passes for 20 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:56:30.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
