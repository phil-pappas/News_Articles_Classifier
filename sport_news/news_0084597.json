(9) Wayne Valley (7-9-1) vs. (2) Hawthorne Christian (13-3) Today at Clifton Stadium, noon \nHow they got here: (9) Wayne Valley def. (5) Clifton, 3-2, in OT; (2) Hawthorne Christian def. (6) Wayne Hills, 5-1. \nKey players: Wayne Valley, Alex Galli, M; Luke St. Denis, M; Scott Sherin, D; Matt Bleeker, D; Brandon Vecere, D; Alex Kasperowicz, M; Anthony Minnella, F; Vincent Minnocci, M; Matt Mihalik, G; Stas Lembryk, M; Aneesh Bhave, D; Peter Leva, M; Nick Thompson, M; Ryan McLean, F. Hawthorne Christian, Chris Silos, D; Collin Callahan, M; Joseph Leveroni, D; Rene White, F; Denys Falcon, F; Kirk Schmidt, F; David Falcon, F; Frank Generoso, M; Clarence Fitchett, B; Will Woodfin, M; Nick Alvarez, B; John Williams, G. \nStory line: Wayne Valley’s well-balanced lineup has made a strong run to the county final. The Indians are difficult to prepare for and their offense is diverse with Minnella, Kasperowicz, Minnocci, Leva and Lembryk dangerous inside and outside the box. \nHawthorne Christian counts heavily on White and Woodfin for offense but others who could pose a problem are Denys and David Falcon, Generoso and Schmidt. … Defensively, Wayne Valley’s Lembryk, along with Vecere, Bleeker and Sherin, must try to keep White from taking control of the game. \nLeveroni, Fitchett, Woodfin and Generoso need to come up with top-shelf efforts for Hawthorne Christian to thrive. … Goalkeepers for both teams are capable of making the clutch save in end-of-game situations. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:33:06.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
