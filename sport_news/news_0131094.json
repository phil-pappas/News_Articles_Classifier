Show Caption Previous Next \nMiami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas spent his day off Tuesday in Fort Pierce, speaking to local youth who attended The First Step meeting — a weekly gathering of kids and community leaders at a park in Fort Pierce. \n\"It reminded me of being back home; just a bunch of kids wanting to get out and have fun,\" Thomas said. \"They had the chance to be around a professional football player, and that's something you don't get every day; I don't care what neighborhood you're in. I loved seeing the smiles on their faces, it made my day.\" \nThomas arrived via helicopter, and was greeted by more than 50 smiling children, some barely 3 years old, others only a few years away from graduating high school. The Dolphins safety signed autographs, answered questions and played a touch football game, where he quarterbacked for both teams. \n\"Just coming from a similar area that most of these kids come from I know the positive impact of having a role model,\" Thomas said. \"If I can just be some type of inspiration and help guide them I feel like I'm doing a good job.\" \nSt. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascara and St. Lucie County Commissioner Chris Dzadovsky were among the local leaders at the event, along with Scott Van Duzer, who is the founder of The First Step. After Thomas was done speaking he was presented with a key to the city of Fort Pierce, and Commissioner Dzadovsky declared it \"Michael Thomas Day.\" \n\"I just wanted to give exposure to the kids and help the dream,\" Thomas said. \"I wanted to show them that there's more to life, regardless of what situation they're in. \n\"Any dream that you have can be done. All you have to do is work hard for it.\" \nFor more information on The First Step, contact Scott Van Duzer at 772-528-3467. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
