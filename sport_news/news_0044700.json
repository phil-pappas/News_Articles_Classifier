The team played their first home game under their new eco-friendly LED lighting system installed by Hellas Construction. This is the third high school stadium in the state of Washington to use LED lighting technology, all of which have been installed this year. “This has been a wonderful project,” said Tom O’Brien, South Kitsap School District’s Director of Facilities and Operations. “The light levels are world class. I am extremely happy with the quality of the lights and we’re looking forward to the energy savings that LED technology will provide.”\nThe $343,000 project includes the demolition and removal of old light poles and the installation of 42 1000-Watt fixtures that will be reducing energy costs at the stadium by 50-75% (a typical HID light package takes 60 15000-Watt fixtures to achieve the same light level). In addition to energy savings, the LED lights also offer 200,000 hours of life and an “Instant On” functionality, whereas HID lights take an average of 15 minutes to power up.\nThe LED lights system is the latest addition to the $1.8 million dollar stadium renovation funded by Kitsap Bank and Debbie and Wayne Macomber. The project includes the installation of a new Matrix® Synthetic Turf multi-purpose field with Hellas’ exclusive Geo Plus, an all-organic and environmentally friendly infill that enhances playability and reduces field temperatures by up to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Hellas’ Cushdrain® shock pad was also added to increase safety and G-Max. In addition, the project features a resurface of the stadium’s old running track with Hellas’ epiQ TRACKS® S200 Re-Top.\nThe community of Port Orchard will have their next opportunity to catch the new light system at Kitsap Bank Stadium on October 9 as the South Kitsap Wolves battle the Bellarmine Prep Lions.\n***\nAbout Hellas Construction\nHeadquartered in Austin, Texas, Hellas Construction is a nationwide contractor with a strong reputation for delivering premium-quality sports construction projects across the United States.
