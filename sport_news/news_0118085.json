Flipped the script\nA year ago when the Sooners defeated West Virginia 45-33 in Morgantown, WV., Oklahoma dominated the game by running the ball. Samaje Perine had a career day with 242 rushing yards on 34 carries and four touchdowns. The entire team didn't even get that total in today's win.\nThe Sooners had 107 total rushing yards from Joe Mixon, Perine and quarterback Baker Mayfield. There were also some questionable play calls with the Sooners up late in the game.\nWhen the Sooners were up 34-24 in the fourth quarter, instead of giving the ball to Perine or Mixon, offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley called a pass play that was intercepted. In the end, the play call didn't hurt the Sooners. And play calls like that might not hurt next week against the struggling Texas Longhorns. But when the Sooners are playing Baylor, Texas Tech or Oklahoma State late in the season, they might need Perine or Mixon to run the ball effectively to take some time off the clock. Difficult to do when the team only focuses on the passing game.\nWith all that being said, the Sooners passing game did shred the Mountaineer 3-3-5 defense in the first half. The vertical game worked extremely well when targeting Michiah Quick and Mark Andrews.\n2. Penalty yards\nRemember that officiating crew that did the highly-criticized Oklahoma State-Texas Longhorn game a week ago? They were a part of this 23-penalty game.\nOklahoma finished with 134 penalty yards on 12 fouls in today's win. They had 75 first quarter penalty yards and a good chunk of them - 45 to be exact - on West Virginia's lone scoring drive of the first half.\nThe Sooners also had five personal foul penalties in the game.\n3. Special team woes for the Mountaineers\nWest Virginia's special teams didn't do itself any favors early in this one. Quarterback Skyler Howard's first meaningful Big 12 road game of his career didn't start too well. The team started inside the 25 yard line five times in the first half due to poor decisions when running the ball back on kickoffs.\nThat meant that the WVU offense had to try to gain some yardage to avoid giving the Sooners good starting field position. Hard to put up points by going on 90-yard drives in a packed house in Norman.\n4. Offensive line for both teams struggled\nBoth offensive line units struggled in this one. The Sooners were able to pressure Howard all throughout the game while generating key turnovers. West Virginia was able to pressure Mayfield in the second half, but the Sooners were able to take advantage of a couple blitzes that the Mountaineers were unable to execute. Mayfield found Sterling Shepard in the second quarter for a 28-yard touchdown when the Mountaineers blitzed. The Sooners were also able to execute a perfect fake screen for a 71-yard touchdown to Durron Neal when WVU blitzed.\n5. Turnover margin\nOut of all of the Big 12 teams, West Virginia and Oklahoma were on two different ends of the spectrum in terms of the turnover margin for the year. The Mountaineers were plus-nine while the Sooners were minus-four for the year. Oklahoma ended up forcing five turnovers (two fumbles, three interceptions) today while WVU had two.\nThe Sooners had two critical strip-sacks in the game.\nWhen the Mountaineers were climbing back into the game early in the third quarter, the Sooners defense needed a stop. West Virginia had scored 10 straight points to trim the lead to seven points until Oklahoma was able to pressure Skyler Howard and force a fumble.\nThe same happened in the fourth quarter with the Sooners up by 10. Linebacker Eric Striker was able to force a fumble that Jordan Evans returned for a 45-yard touchdown.\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOklahoma 44, West Virginia 24: Complete coverage\nBox score\nDiscuss this and the Big 12 with Chuck Carlton on Thursday; ask questions now.\nClick here to visit the Oklahoma Sooners page\nFive thoughts: Sooners' defense comes up big; where was running game?\nPhotos: Undefeated Oklahoma tunes up for Texas by leaving West Virginia in wake\nOklahoma forces five turnovers in win over West Virginia\nCarlton: Unbeaten Oklahoma rolls into Cotton Bowl, as Texas staggers along\nOklahoma quotable: Bob Stoops on Sooners creating turnovers, facing Longhorns\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://d-news.co/SYNiW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/oklahoma-sooners", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/10/03/photos-undefeated-oklahoma-tunes-texas-leaving-west-virginia-wake", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/texas-rangers/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/carlton-unbeaten-oklahoma-rolls-cotton-bowl-astexas-staggers-along", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/oklahoma-forces-five-turnovers-win-west-virginia", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-oklahoma-sooners-defense-comes-big-win-west-virginia-running-game", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/oklahoma-quotable-bob-stoops-sooners-creating-turnovers-facing-texas-longhorns-next-week", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030024&home=24&vis=17&final=true", "http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-03T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:49:03.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
