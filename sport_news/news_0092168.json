Afterward, he became the face of an anti-smoking campaign. \nHis career began at Ajax and took him to Barcelona where, as player and later coach, his footballing philosophy laid the foundations for the dominant Barca teams of recent years. \nBarcelona financial vice president Susana Monje sent the club's best wishes to its former player and coach. \n\"We would like from the club to give Johan Cruyff and all of his friends a very big hug after hearing today of the situation that he is living through,\" Monje said. \nA three-time European footballer of the year, Cruyff was synonymous with the \"Clockwork Orange\" Netherlands teams of the early 1970s whose attacking style earned the team fans around the world. \nWith Cruyff on the field, Ajax won the European Championship for three consecutive years from 1971-1973 before he moved to Barcelona in 1973 and led the middle-of-the-table team to its first national title in a decade. \nCruyff was voted best player of the 1974 World Cup, where the Netherlands lost in the final to Germany. \nAssociated Press writer Harold Heckle in Madrid contributed. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:34:59.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
