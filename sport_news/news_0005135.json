If the Lady Tigers advance, they will face Mountain View or Woodstock on Tuesday. But if they don’t, not only will Douglas County’s season end but it will be Jackson’s final volleyball game since she will not play in college.“I just want to focus on my studies and travel abroad,” said Jackson, who plans to major in international studies. “I want to teach English to kids in third world countries.”Planning to attend Kennesaw State or Georgia State, Jackson has a 3.5 grade-point average and her favorite subjects are Spanish and French, which she can speak well.On the court, Jackson plays a major role in the offense functioning correctly along with middle hitters Kennedy Curtis (senior) and junior Mmachi Okeke, who record majority of the kills.“I’ve been setting for a long time so it kind of comes naturally,” Jackson said. “You have to know your hitters and know what they need or know what needs to be done to set them up for a good kill.”Jackson is one of nine seniors on the team and a captain alongside Emily Upton, a senior defensive specialist.“A lot of athleticism goes into the way I play,” Jackson said. “I hustle for everything. Wherever my team needs me I’m there.”Jackson said her biggest improvement this season has been communicating with her teammates. One of her happiest moments of the season took place when the Lady Tigers defeated Alexander in their first matchup. Her favorite player to watch is setter Alisha Glass of the US Women’s National Volleyball team.
