He has a journalism degree from Lehigh University, a satellite radio show on SiriusXM and he's savvy enough to anticipate reporters' questions before they are finished asking them. When television cameras and reporters gathered around him at the Trail Blazers ' practice facility to ask about playing point guard in the upcoming NBA season, he smirked because he knew this line of question was coming.\n\"I don't think too much. I just play,\" McCollum explains.\nMcCollum is days away from his most important season in the league. He will start at shooting guard and -- when Damian Lillard is out the game -- will be asked to play point guard for stretches. The larger role comes with added expectations. But McCollum doesn't lack confidence. The same guy who smirks at interview questions because he knows what's coming plays with a similar self-assuredness on the court.\nHis breakout performance against the Memphis Grizzlies in the playoffs last spring, in which he averaged 17.5 points and shot 47.8 percent from three-point range, may have surprised the rest of the NBA world. But McCollum always believed he could be an impact player even when had to wait behind veteran incumbents in the rotation during his first two seasons.\n\"Offensively I know I'm gifted and talented,\" McCollum said. \"And I've worked on a lot of stuff, so offensively I know I'm going to be able to get to spots and get shots.\"\n\"CJ's a scorer so he's going to go out there and he's going to score points,\" Lillard added regarding his backcourt partner.\nIn seven exhibition games in October, McCollum averaged 18.3 points and 4.4 assists while playing both guard spots. His best game came with Lillard out of the lineup when he started at point guard and scored 30 points against the Sacramento Kings, highlighted by an explosive 19-point third quarter. He called his first extended run at point guard \"up and down\" while noting he still wants to improve on defense and as a distributor.\nHe worked hard this summer to make sure he was prepared for the shift in role and expectations. He focused on getting stronger and on his balance. He trained at Peak Performance Project in Santa Barbara, Calif. and was a mainstay at the Blazers practice facility. He also spent three days working with future Hall of Famer Steve Nash, learning the intricacies of point guard play from an all-time great.\nImproving as a point guard was certainly an emphasis for McCollum in the offseason. However he won't shy away from his identity. He's a natural scorer and the Blazers will need him to score as the clear cut second option on offense behind Lillard. The Blazers want McCollum to play to his strengths. The challenge is finding the sweet spot between attacking and setting up the offense.\n\"It's a delicate balance for scoring point guards in this league to do what they do best, which is score, but, at the same time, run the offense (and) facilitate opportunities for your teammates,\" Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \"I thought CJ did as good a job as I could have hoped for (during the exhibition season).\"\nWhen McCollum tells reporters \"I don't think too much. I just play\" he is half lying. On the court, he may let his instincts take over, but off it there is a lot of thought that goes into improving his game. When he talks about the upcoming season he references changes in \"usage rates\" and points out his \"defensive rating.\" Part of his approach is highly analytical. McCollum studies his shot charts and has his own Synergy Sports account, a video based analytical scouting service. He watches hours of video of his own game as well as other players around the league.\n\"Watching different guys in the league who are good at finishing in the lane like (Mike) Conley and Chris Paul and Steph (Curry),\" McCollum said of what he studies on film. \"Just seeing guys pick and roll usage rates, how you manipulate ball screens. I think it's helpful.\"\nIf he sees a new statistic that he isn't familiar with, McCollum will reach out to analytics specialist and ask for clarification.\n\"CJ is a very intelligent guy and he is a aware of a lot analytically,\" Stotts said. \"I think it's important that players play, but to be able to use that information to their benefit can be helpful.\"\nThe knowing smirk that comes before an interview question is born out of McCollum's preparation. The former sports editor of his college newspaper has a good idea of what's coming. With a season of unknown ahead he's diligent in making sure he is similarly prepared for the new challenge.\n\"Play your game but do what you're good at. I think that's the biggest thing for guys,\" he said. \"Find out your role and do that really well and you'll stick in this league and last a long time.\"\n-- Mike Richman\nmrichman@oregonian.com\n@ mikegrich", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mikegrich/"], "published": "2015-10-26T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:18:43.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
