We still need the timing, practice, understanding what we’re trying to do,” Casey said. \n“We came out with a pre-season mentality and we can’t afford to do that. We need to start ramping it up and getting our mind and our body ready for a physical battle ... Our motion offence has got us moving, (the) ball moving from side-to-side, but we can do it quicker and crisper and I don’t think we’re there yet as far as cutting hard, getting our knees bent, ready to shoot the ball. That’s going to come with time. I know we all hate the pre-season, but that’s what it’s for.” \nCasey praised the bench for picking up the slack after a slow start by the opening group and centre Jonas Valanciunas agreed that the team has to be better immediately following the tip. \n“We’ve got to change that. We’ve still got some time, but mentally we have to change some things,” Valanciunas said. “We want to go into the real games, but still need some time.” \nLeBron James made the trip north of the border, but sat out, as expected, alongside fellow all-star Kyrie Irving (out until at least December after injuring his knee in Game 1 of the Finals) and Iman Shumpert (also out for months). \nBoth teams struggled mightily with their shot-making, including Cavs superstar Kevin Love, who went 2-for-7 from the field for six points in 13 minutes in his long-awaited return to the lineup. \nLove had been out for nearly six months, ever since injuring his shoulder in the first round of the playoffs when Boston’s Kelly Olynyk yanked on it. \n“I felt really comfortable,” Love said. “Body felt better than it has in a long time, so it was a good first step.” \nLove wasn’t the only one misfiring, DeMar DeRozan’s pre-season struggles continued, as he went just 3-for-11 from the floor, while uncharacteristically missing 2-of-3 free throw attempts. \nNBA pre-season scoring leader Kyle Lowry also returned to earth, shooting just 2-for-11, though he did hand out eight assists. \nFellow starter DeMarre Carroll also was 2-for-11, while Valanciunas scored 12 to lead the Raptors. Cory Joseph added 11 points and six assists in another strong performance off of the bench. \nThe Cavs came in so short-handed that backup point guard and playoff hero Matthew Dellavedova, just 6-foot-4, started at small forward. He scored 12 points, one less than team scoring leader Mo Williams, who started at the point. \nOne more tilt remains before the Oct. 28th season-opener against Indiana, Friday’s game against the Washington Wizards in Montreal. \nSCOLA FACTOR \nLuis Scola got his first start of the pre-season on Sunday and though there had been concerns about his fit with that group, specifically Valanciunas, the early returns were good. \nScola was probably the best Raptor in the opening quarter and made a nice big-to-big dish to Valanciunas under the hoop for an easy score at one point, instead of forcing up a shot. \nAside from a couple of quick fouls, Scola was solid, finishing with eight points and three rebounds in 15 minutes. \n“I thought he was solid. He took advantage of a mismatch, did a good job in the post,” Casey said. \nPresumptive starting power forward Patrick Patterson continued his quiet play, scoring only five points on five shot attempts. \nHe also hauled in only a single rebound and has now scored more than five points only once in the pre-season and has had more than two rebounds only once. \nPatterson impressed defensively though, particularly in the fourth quarter, when he had a steal and a blocked shot to stop Cleveland forays into the paint. \nNOT MISSED? \nCasey has said he intends to go with two point guards a fair bit this season (Lowry and Joseph, with rookie Delon Wright perhaps entering the picture later on). Before the game, he was asked about the team’s struggles last season when it opted to do the same. \nThe response was a little surprising, in that it wasn’t very complimentary to departed guards Greivis Vasquez and Lou Williams. \n“The problem last year going small wasn’t Kyle, it was the other small guys with him,” Casey said. \nWilliams and Vasquez are both well below average defenders, something that Joseph certainly is not and both forced a lot of shots, which Joseph doesn’t tend to do very often. \nAROUND THE RIM \nToronto improved to 23-7 in pre-season games since Casey became head coach in 2011, though he would surely take 7-23 with more regular-season victories, if given a choice ... While the Raptors did a much better job of defending without fouling compared to the rest of the exhibition outings, there were still some defensive issues on Sunday. For one, the team struggled to get out to defend the three-point line quickly enough, particularly in the third quarter ... James averaged 11 points on 32% shooting in his two pre-season appearances. Don’t think the Cavs are too concerned. Ditto about the now 0-6 record.
