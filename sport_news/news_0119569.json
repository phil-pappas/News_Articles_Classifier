We're very deep. Our defensive core is one of the best and we're going to have to play like that if we're going to have success.” \nThe Jets, 2-0 after wins over the Boston Bruins and New Jersey Devils, took Saturday off and are back in game action on Monday afternoon against the New York Islanders as they continue a four-game road trip. \nSo far, the Jets' defence is living up to its billing. \nMyers wasn't boasting, but he was simply suggesting the Jets don't have to take a back seat to anyone in this debate – one which should include the Calgary Flames (when healthy), St. Louis Blues, Nashville Predators, Minnesota Wild, Tampa Bay Lightning and New York Rangers – either. \nThere's no Norris Trophy winner in the group at this point, though a few players could work themselves into the discussion some day. \nBut that's part of what makes the group special. \nThere isn't just one pairing that is counted on to play 30-plus minutes a game, while another needs to be sheltered. \nThe strength is in the collective. \n“We know who we are and what we can do,” said Byfuglien. “We just come out and do our job.” \nThe Jets have an incredibly deep right side, which is somewhat of a rarity in the NHL, with Myers, Byfuglien and Trouba spread along the three pairings. \nOn the left, there's the mobile Toby Enstrom, the grit and sandpaper of Mark Stuart and an emerging youngster in Ben Chiarot, who is physical, can skate and has been a nice complement to Byfuglien. \nBut that's not all, the Jets have Paul Postma and Adam Pardy in reserve, just waiting for an opportunity to present itself and several other guys down on the farm, including Jay Harrison, who scored two goals in his return to the American Hockey League after clearing waivers earlier this week. \nNot to mention the group of prospects that is headlined by 2013 first-rounder Josh Morrissey. \nThere's no shortage of potential, but can that be too much of a good thing? \n“A lot of fist fights on the bench for ice time, that's what I'm predicting,” joked Jets head coach Paul Maurice. “We've got a really solid group back there and that's the area I think we're looking to see the biggest improvement in our overall team game, utilizing those six guys. They can all get up the ice, they're big and strong in their own end. \n“It's a unique back end, there's extremes. There's height and speed and we've got some real physical guys back there that have a little meanness to their game. Really good puck movement, almost right through the mix. We like our D and we think that will be the key piece here, to maximize what our team can do, in getting those guys on the ice at the right times and getting their game dialled in.” \nThat internal push should also help keep everyone sharp. \n“We probably have nine of 10 D who could play in the NHL,” said Trouba. “You've got to be on your game every time, because there's someone chomping at the bit to get more ice. It's a healthy thing that we have here. \n“As a D corps, we want to be the best that we can be and we definitely have the players back there to be pretty solid.” \nBeing solid is the first step to gaining league-wide recognition, though that's not something the Jets are going to spend much time worrying about. \n“Time will tell,” said Stuart. “We want to be at the top of the league in team defence. That's what we look at first and foremost.” \nThe rest will take care of itself. \nKen.wiebe@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:45:26.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
