Completion is targeted by January 2018, he said.\nThe center, opened in 1990, gets a tremendous amount of student, faculty and staff traffic. The hub of activity houses student activities offices, athletic staff offices, numerous study lounge areas, seven places to eat, a movie theater, a game room, and a credit union for students.\nThe Student Activities Center has 365,000 square feet of space and the capital makeover will include a 32,000-square-foot expansion, Karman said. Some portions of the four-level structure probably will be closed off at times to accommodate the renovation.\nThe work will include mechanical, electrical and plumbing upgrades, removal of a ramp and an escalator, various lobby, lounge and staircase improvements, some facade touch-ups, plus a new bookstore, several new athletic staff offices and one new food-service area. The expansion will provide primarily new meeting rooms\nThe budget for the project includes nearly $10 million in university bonds, with the rest of the funding from student activities fees previously collected, private donations and some additional university contributions.\nKarman said the activities building continues to get heavy use, despite the opening two years ago of a $37.5 million Student Recreation Center along Fourth Street. That 128,000-square-foot structure has extensive exercise facilities, six basketball courts, space for indoor soccer or floor hockey, racquetball courts and a jogging track.\nReporter Sheldon S.
