The Orioles competed at the AVCTL meet at Crestview in Andover. Augusta took a respectable fourth place with a score of 437. Winfield won the team title with a dominant score of 356, Andale was second with a 415 and Mulvane was third with a 431. Winfield and Andale both will be at the same Regional next week. The top three teams at Regionals will advance to State, as well as the top five golfers not on a qualifying team. Scores were a little high all the way around with the field this week. Winfield's Abby Bertholf won the meet with a round of 79. There were only two golfers in the 80s, and six in the 90s. Augusta's Ashley Roby led the Orioles with a round of 96, which was good to take eighth place overall. Katie Webster wasn't far behind as she tied for 11th for Augusta with a 101. Lyndsay Stuart shot 118 to take 20th. Sarah Braddy (122) was 23rd and Lindsey Lewellan (123) was tied for 24th. Other teams the Orioles will face Monday include Andover Central, Buhler, Kingman, Circle, Collegiate and Wichita Trinity Academy.
