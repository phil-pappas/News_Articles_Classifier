The Whalers struck for a touchdown on their first play from scrimmage when senior quarterback Andrew Rapoza hooked up with senior wide receiver Manny Onuoha for a 56-yard bomb that made it a 6-0 game just 17 seconds in. \"We were looking to get off to a quick start and Andrew made a great throw,\" said Onuoha, who finished with four catches for 110 yards and three touchdowns. \"If you run your route and get open, he's going to get you the ball and that play gave us some momentum right away. We came in ready to throw the ball and we made a statement with that first drive.\" New Bedford kept the pedal to the metal after that, scoring on four of its next six possessions to build a commanding 35-0 lead at halftime. The Eagles also bungled a second-quarter punt out of their own end zone when the snap sailed over the head of Colby Watson for a safety that gave the Whalers two points. Senior running back Jonathan Moraes rushed for a 12-yard touchdown and Rapoza ran in the two-point conversion to make it 14-0 after the first quarter. New Bedford put 21 more points on the board in the second quarter on a 19-yard pass to Onuoha, the safety, a 9-yard run by Victor Carrion and a 27-yard pass to Onuoha and an extra point by John Owens. That gave the Whalers a 35-0 halftime advantage and they capped their scoring with a 52-yard punt return by senior wide wide receiver/defensive back Jordan Ross with 9:22 left in the third quarter. The game was originally scheduled for Friday night, but it never got started because of lightning and was rescheduled for Saturday morning. \"That knocked us off our routine a little bit, but we made sure everyone stayed focused on the task at hand,\" New Bedford coach Mark DeBrito said. \"I was happy with our execution on both sides of the ball. We still have some things to work on, but we got the job done. We didn't have a lot of penalties and we were consistent from start to finish. We got off to a strong start and we finished strong.\" Rapoza, who played well for the second straight week after coming back from a concussion, completed 9-of-13 passes for 206 yards and three touchdowns. \"He leads with his actions and he's been getting the job done all season,\" DeBrito said. \"He sets the tone for us and his teammates have complete confidence in him. He makes good decisions with the ball, he's a tough runner and he has the ability to make a play no matter what the situation is. He's a talented, dangerous player and you can never count him out.\" WHAT IT MEANS: The win was the second straight for the Whalers (3-2, 0-0 Big 3 Conference), who notched an impressive 41-20 win at Barnstable last week and have outscored their last two opponents 83-20. ... The Eagles dropped to 0-6. They were outscored 40-18 in their first two games and have been shut out the last four weeks by a combined score of 171-0 in losses to La Salle (47-0), South Kingstown (47-0), Bishop Hendricken (35-0) and New Bedford (42-0).
