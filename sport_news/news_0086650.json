Then inside a minute he had the simplest of finishes on a counter-attack. \nNeymar then turned provider in the 77th minute, crossing for Suarez to deliver Barcelona's fifth goal of the night. \nSevilla came from behind to salvage a point at Eibar with a 1-1 draw. \nBorja Baston gave in-form Eibar an early lead but the visitors improved in the second half and drew level through Kevin Gameiro's close-range effort on 71 minutes. \nThe Andalusians remain in mid-table and are still searching for their first away win of the season in all competitions, while Eibar missed out on an opportunity to cement their place in the top six. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
