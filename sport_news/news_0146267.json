Futures point to opening gains on Wall Street today. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose above $46 per barrel. The dollar gained against the yen and edged down against the euro. WASHINGTON (AP) - There's probably not a lot of news for investors contained in economic reports that are due out in the first part of the week. But they will be of some interest. Today, the Institute for Supply Management will release its service sector index for September. Tomorrow, the Commerce Department will report on international trade in August. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will release consumer credit data for August. WASHINGTON (AP) - An Associated Press analysis of data finds that America's crushing surge of student debt, now at $1.2 trillion, has bred a disturbing new phenomenon: School loans that span multiple generations within families. Weighed down by their own loans, many parents lack the means to fund their children's educations without sinking even deeper into debt. Americans over 40 account for 35 percent of education debt, up from 25 percent in 2004, according to the New York Federal Reserve. And adults from 35 to 50 years old owe about as much as people fresh out of college do -- an average of $20,000. HONG KONG (AP) - The World Bank has trimmed its growth forecast for developing East Asian economies, reflecting risks from China's slowdown and a looming U.S. interest rate hike. The bank says it expects developing Asian and Pacific economies to grow 6.5 percent this year, down 0.2 percentage points from its previous outlook. It forecast growth of 6.4 percent next year, down 0.3 percentage points from its previous outlook. WASHINGTON (AP) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says some Wall Street executives should have gone to jail for their roles in the financial crisis that gripped the country in 2008 and triggered the Great Recession. Billions of dollars in fines have been levied against major banks and brokerage firms. But in an interview with USA Today published Sunday, Bernanke said he thinks that in addition to the corporations, individuals should have been held more accountable. Â© 2015 Associated Press.
