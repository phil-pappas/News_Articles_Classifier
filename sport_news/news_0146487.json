The Dolphins are preparing for an NFL football game against the New York Jets at London's Wembley stadium on Sunday. (AP Photo/Tim Ireland) \nLONDON (AP) — Miami Dolphins left tackle Branden Albert is doubtful to play against the New York Jets on Sunday because of an injured left hamstring. \nAlbert missed last week’s game against Buffalo and was limited at practice all week. He was hurt in the second quarter of the season opener against Jacksonville, and is expected to be replaced for the second straight game by Jason Fox. \nDolphins backup tight end Dion Sims was ruled out Friday with a concussion, while starting tight end Jordan Cameron (groin) is questionable, leaving Jake Stoneburner as the only fully healthy player at the position. \nBackup running back Jonas Gray (calf) is questionable. Defensive tackle Earl Mitchell (back) is probable. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:42:45.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
