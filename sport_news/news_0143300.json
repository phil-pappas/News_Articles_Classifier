The stomp — in which teams compete to stomp the most juice from 25 pounds of grapes — is held in conjunction with the Gold Rush Street Faire. The street faire features a variety of vendors along Main Street in Murphys. Admission to both events are free along with free parking. During the stomp, teams of two — many with creative names and costumes — compete to collect the most juice in three-minute heats. Teams consist of a “stomper,” who stands in half a winebarrel with the grapes, and a “swabber,” who stands outside the barrel and reaches in to help flow the juice out of a drain spout. Prizes are awarded to all the winners, and the finals will be held at 4:30 p.m. Teams are encouraged to appear in costume and prizes are awarded based on originality, design and effort. The Murphys Friends will be serving barbecue food, with proceeds supporting the group’s annual Free Christmas Dinner. There will also be silent and live auctions. Prizes range from a rafting trip with O.A.R.S. to 2016 San Francisco Giants tickets and a half-barrel containing one bottle from each Calaveras County winery. Award-winning wines will be sold by the glass for $15, which includes a commemorative wine glass. Refills are $8, and a glass of wine in a cup also costs $8. Commemorative T-shirts, tote bags, wine bottle openers, beer, bottled water and soft drinks will also be for sale. The Grape Stomp is produced by the Calaveras Winegrape Alliance. All the proceeds from the auction go to support area nonprofit community groups and schools. The proceeds from this year’s Grape Stomp T-shirt will be donated to the Calaveras Community Foundation’s Disaster Relief Fund to support those impacted by the recent Butte Fire. • What: Calaveras Grape Stomp. • When: Saturday, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. • Where: Murphys Community Park.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:16:32.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
