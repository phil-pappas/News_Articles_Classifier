Officials are investigating the motive behind the killing.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:54:39.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
