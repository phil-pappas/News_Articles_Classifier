Rookie running back Todd Gurley finished strong in his first NFL start after rushing for 106 of his 146 yards in the fourth quarter. \nThe performance gave a confidence boost to a relatively inexperienced offensive line with two rookie starters. \n\"There's nothing like success,\" offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti said. \"We want to move on and get another one.\" \nNO RUSH: Green Bay's rush defense has been stout of late, limiting starting running backs to an average of about 36 yards on 11 carries over the last three games. Mike Daniels and B.J. Raji are off to strong starts on the line, and linebacker Clay Matthews has been making plays whether he's lined up on the inside or outside. \nThe defense is succeeding even without two of its better run defenders: safety Morgan Burnett (calf) has missed three of the last four games, while starting inside linebacker Sam Barrington (right foot) is out for the year. \nSACKS STREAK: Stopping the run on early downs allows the Packers to focus on the pass rush on third-and-longs. Rodgers and the offense also have a propensity to score early at home to put teams in catch-up situations that can make opposing offenses even more one-dimensional. \nThose are key factors in why the Packers have compiled 13 sacks over the last two games. Matthews and Julius Peppers are elite pass rushers, though the Packers are also getting pressure from a deep group of outside linebackers including Nick Perry, Mike Neal and up-and-comer Jayrone Elliott . \nMEN IN MIDDLE: Speaking of getting to the quarterback, the Rams' Donald is already one of the best in the business in just his second year in the league. The defensive tackle and 2014 Defensive Rookie of the Year has 3 1/2 sacks to pace St. Louis' formidable front. The interior of the Green Bay line is strong with center Corey Linsley flanked by guards Josh Sitton and T.J. Lang . \nBACKFIELD WRINKLE: Green Bay added a different wrinkle last week against San Francisco by lining up receivers Randall Cobb and Ty Montgomery in the backfield for a series, to solid results. It gives Rodgers two speedy and athletic weapons lined up next to him, and opposing defenses a new worry. \n\"I would ask the defensive coordinators that, but I think both guys can run with the football and they can both catch it,\" Rodgers said. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:39:40.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
