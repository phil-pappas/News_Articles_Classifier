Florida receiver Antonio Callaway, who had a 72-yard punt return for a score, also had his hands on a long pass to the end zone from Treon Harris in the middle of the fourth quarter, but LSU's Dwyane Thomas punched it out to prevent a tying touchdown. \nHarris, starting for the suspended Will Grier, passed for 271 yards and two touchdowns for Florida (6-1, 4-1 SEC). Brandon Harris threw for 202 yards and two scores for LSU (6-0, 4-0). \nAP college football website: http://www.collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:43:54.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
