The Bengals game is another example of get a lead, and then turn conservative.\nMy neighbor and I watch the games together, and if we can call the plays Bevell is going to call, you don’t think the defensive coordinator or defensive players for the other team don’t know what’s coming?\nAlso, you have an offensive line that can’t protect Russell Wilson. You look at the other teams, they draft linemen out of college. The Seahawks have college tight ends, linebackers and defensive lineman for line coach Tom Cable to try to turn into professional offensive linemen. \nSorry, folks, they have a lot of teaching ahead of them, and Wilson is going to be pretty banged up this season.\nMost Read Stories 12 reasons why living in Washington is better than living in Oregon Renton pot bust: 3,000 marijuana plants, $440,000 seized Why Bremerton coach Joe Kennedy’s stance on postgame prayer is admirable Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman released from jail Friday Seahawks’ Derrick Coleman arrested for investigation of hit, run Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Mike Robbins, Kent \nSchneider needs to take heat, too We’re still shaking our heads and wondering what went wrong during the last quarter and overtime of the Cincinnati game. Some of the blame can go to coach Pete Carroll. The defense turned conservative and stopped attacking, which allowed quarterback Andy Dalton to do pretty much whatever he wanted. \nBut, at the same time, the porous offensive line reared its ugly head and put Russell Wilson on the run again. General manager John Schneider has to shoulder some of the blame for the state of the offensive line, which features too many converted defensive players trying to plug holes. \nRaymond S. Wilson, Bellevue \nIt’s not looking the same Most of the fans would be fine with losing on the road to an undefeated team like Cincinnati. However, the way the Seahawks lost was pathetic. \nHow in the world does a team that prides itself on shutdown defense and so much talent give up a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter? \nUnlike last year, this year’s team has some serious issues. Buckle up, fans, the ride is going to get even rougher.\nPaul Watson, Kirkland \nThis fan still believes For all the people who can’t remember, the Seahawks limped out of the gate to a 3-3 record and then won 9 of their next 10 games last season. \nEveryone needs to take a deep breath and let things unfold on the field before we make any assumptions about what may happen the rest of the season. \nI know I have faith in this team and the coaching staff.\nJeff Swanson, Everett \nBennett’s play was dumb Just watched Michael Bennett cost the Hawks great field position at a critical time, late in the first half after Earl Thomas’ interception. Why? For going after the weakest player on the Bengals team, quarterback Andy Dalton, who was not in the play.\nOften during this season, Bennett hurts the team more then he helps, and shows absolutely no class.\nRandy Fillingim, Seattle \nIt’s a sad-sack situation Russell Wilson is getting sacked so much, his opponents now ask, “paper or plastic?”\nNoel Freedman, Stanwood \nPrayer Not impressed by coach’s stance I thought Matt Calkins’ column on the Bremerton coach and his violation of school policy (“With head bowed, coach stands tall,” Oct. 16) was the most astounding piece of pretzel logic I’ve read in a long time.\nCalkins is impressed that the coach asks, “How do you teach your kids about courage if you don’t do it?” Well, you do that by ignoring the fact that you’re also teaching your kids to disobey the law, violate the policies you agreed to abide by when you accepted the job and, oh yeah, ignore one of those principles America was founded on. You know, that one about separation of church and state.\nRichard Grout, Friday Harbor \nCoach shouldn’t be applauded Matt Calkins should stick to his regular beat and leave philosophical and spiritual matters to more knowledgeable people. \nIn expressing his admiration of the Bremerton football coach and his defiance of the both the Bremerton school district’s orders and the U. S. Constitution, Calkins is showing his remarkable ignorance of the law and one of our nation’s founding principles.\nThe Bremerton coach brags about defending something about which he is ignorant, but should a sports columnist for a major newspaper be praising defiance of a long-held U.S. Supreme Court decision that prayer led by school officials on public school property is unconstitutional?\nPray at home, pray in church, and pray on the street corner. But don’t pray on school grounds, where — the courts have repeatedly declared — such prayer can be taken to mean that government is endorsing a particular religion.\nLester Goldstein, Seattle \nSend us your backtalk: \nLetters bearing real names, addresses and telephone numbers for verification are considered for publication.
