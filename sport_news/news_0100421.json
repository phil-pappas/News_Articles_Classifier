The phenomenon has triggered an explosion in the prices that companies like ESPN are willing to pay for sports programming because it’s one of the few reliable draws for viewers.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/LeadershipReport More in C-Suite Mary Barra on GM’s Long-Haul Plan How Not to Flunk at Failure Minimum Wages and the Casual-Dining Chain A New Way to Sell Oreos The Risk of Employee-Performance Ratings The Plan to Fix Sprint The result: Sports teams are suddenly worth multiples more than before, and the demand for live sports has skyrocketed.\nThe Wall Street Journal talked to Mr. Grousbeck, 54, about managing a major sports franchise at a time of rapid change both for professional sports and the media landscape. Edited excerpts of the conversation follow.\nLooking for fireworks WSJ: Early last year, you predicted the Celtics would score some big-name talent and that fans could expect “fireworks” in the roster. This hasn’t materialized, and you’ve since been criticized for the comment. Do you regret making it?\nMR. GROUSBECK: I’ve done that kind of thing since the beginning. I named [my investment group] Banner 17 and they only had 16 championship banners at the time. So that’s similar, which is to say, “We’re going for it, we’re going big.” We tried to light some fireworks over the last two summers. Instead, it’s been more steady progress. I’m always on the lookout for some fireworks, and I think it would be great for the franchise if we could make something happen. So, no, I don’t regret it. I learned from a professor back in Stanford Business School, if you don’t set a very big, aggressive goal, you’re never going to get anywhere.\nWSJ: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and NCAA President Mark Emmert disagree over how early players should be allowed to turn pro. Mr. Silver wants them have more college experience; Mr. Emmert has said players talented enough to go right to the NBA shouldn’t have to spend even a year in college. Where do you stand?\nMR. GROUSBECK: We have said we’d be happy to have a two-year minimum stay in college, but we haven’t been able to get agreement on that with the players union. So the one year is sort of a compromise. It’s a difficult issue and one we can’t resolve without our union. We have to respect the right of the player that, if they have the talent to play professional, it’s hard to restrict them from doing that. The debate is, “What’s the best way to handle young talented men and women who really want to play sooner?”\nWSJ: The fantasy-sports industry is under fire amid questions over how much internal data employees have access to, and whether that data can help them win as contestants on other daily fantasy sites. The NBA owns a piece of FanDuel, one of these companies. How do you view fantasy sports and its relationship with the league?\nMR. GROUSBECK: [The Celtics] do have a partnership with DraftKings. We think they are a very solid company and I am sure they will work through this issue. Fantasy sports is here to stay. For us, it means that people are watching not just their home team but games all across the league. It creates more engaged fans.\nENLARGE WSJ: Team values are exploding. It was a record when you bought the Celtics for $360 million; the Los Angeles Clippers sold last year for $2 billion. Is this sustainable? Is it realistic?\nMR. GROUSBECK: It’s hard to put a green eyeshade on and add up the dollars and cents. But even from the dollars and cents it’s nice to see the league and players all doing better as the business has evolved. I don’t spend any time thinking about the value of the teams because I’m in this for the long haul.\nWSJ: Huge cable deals are driving this increase in values, and it’s taxing cable companies like ESPN as people look to other sources for entertainment. Is the industry headed for a bubble?\nMR. GROUSBECK: The value of content seems to get higher as the number of distribution pipes increases. The more distribution companies that want to be the top choice of consumers, the more they will pay for the content. Will that continue indefinitely? Nothing continues indefinitely. But I think there is always going to be a place for the home TV and there is always going to be a place for the smartphone. Our game is particularly great on smartphones, so that helps us.\nWant to bet? WSJ: NBA Commissioner Silver came out in support of sports betting. Where do you stand?\nMR. GROUSBECK: I am in agreement with the commissioner. If it’s going to exist anyway, it’s best to have it regulated and have it under control and have the teams and players benefit from it.\nWSJ: The NBA last year set out to force Clippers owner Donald Sterling to sell the team after racist comments he made became public in a recording. NBA owners backed that decision. How do you handle a situation where you help decide the fate of someone who is a rival and a member of your league with whom you do business?\nMR. GROUSBECK: I can’t talk about that specifically because there is a lawsuit pending. Being part of 30 people running NBA teams is an awesome feeling but also a huge responsibility. We are responsible not only to the players and the fans and the sponsors and the general public, but we’re responsible with each other. I try not to make it about myself, and that makes it easier for me to hold up my part of what the Celtics would expect.\nMs. Terlep is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
