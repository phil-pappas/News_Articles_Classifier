ORADELL — Jarrett Guarantano gave an animated fist pump. Korab Idrizi’s outstretched arms enthusiastically motioned up and down, prompting the Crusader Crazies to join him in celebration.\nAnd Josh McKenzie, who had just trucked his way through the line for the game-clinching first down, simply pointed to the rowdy group of Bergen Catholic diehards.\nThe raw and genuine on-field emotion showed just how much this one meant for the Crusaders.\n“It just sends chills throughout your body to be able to point up at those fans who love us,” said McKenzie, who signed his first autograph to a young fan following the game.\n“It’s a great feeling that’s kind of indescribable. This is why I came to Bergen Catholic. These are the moments I want to be a part of.”\nAfter ending up on the wrong side of back-to-back lopsided scores against rival Paramus Catholic the past two years, the Crusaders defeated the Paladins, 27-21, on a wet Saturday as the Crusader Crazies in the student section cheered. The Big North United victory was highlighted by Frankie Feaster’s blocked field goal and Trevor Weingarten’s ensuing 87-yard scoop and score in the third quarter to put BC up, 21-7.\nBut it was also a coming out party of sorts for McKenzie, the highly touted freshman who has been hampered by a hip injury suffered in BC’s first game Sept. 5.\nThe top-ranked incoming freshman in the nation has seen time sparingly since the first half of BC’s season opener against American Heritage, but showed flashes of dominance Saturday against a talented PC front seven, featuring Rashan Gary, Drew Singleton and Corey Bolds.\n“I might not be 100 percent yet, but you’ve just got to push through it,” McKenzie said. “I’m just going to come out and play. And I’m not going to stop.”\nWith BC coach Nunzio Campanile remaining cautious with McKenzie, the freshman carried only three times in the first three quarters for 22 yards and played a little less than half of the Crusaders’ defensive snaps at safety.\nBut when the game was on the line, the outcome hanging in the balance and the Crusaders trying to hold off a late Paladins comeback, it was McKenzie getting his number called seven times for 43 yards in the fourth, including a 2-yard run on third-and-1 with 1:02 left to seal the victory.\nHe admitted, though not a part of last year’s 44-7 PC rout of BC, he was “playing with a bit of a chip on my shoulder.”\n“He’s a violent runner and he’s a physical, physical runner,” Campanile said of McKenzie, who also broke an 18-yard run on a third-and-13 in the third and 23-yard run on a first-and-15 with 4:22 left in the fourth, both showcasing his explosion.\n“He sure don’t run like no freshman. He brings it and he’s a legit player. People talk about all the hype and all that, but he’s a legit runner.”\nCampanile said McKenzie has been “chomping at the bit” to return to consistent action.\nHis game-changing ability, mostly all coming between the tackles Saturday, gives the Crusaders — specifically their run game — another dynamic dimension to their offense to pair with the dual-threat Guarantano.\n“He loves to lie to me and tell me that he’s been feeling fine,” Campanile said with a laugh. “But that’s what you want in kids.\n“He’ll follow you around like a puppy dog, like, ‘Hey, Coach, if you want a few first downs, give it to 6.’ But hey, it’s a great trait to have.”\nMcKenzie made a difference Saturday, but he was far from the only Crusader who excelled. Andrew Vito (nine catches, 67 yards, TD), Ryan McCarthy (four catches, 90 yards — 85 YAC — and an 11-yard TD run in the fourth) and Idrizi (four catches, 51 yards, TD) all benefited from another strong day from Guarantano (22-of-37, 274 yards, 2 TD), who showed grit and toughness in the pocket despite being under heavy pressure (eight sacks) all game.\n“What [PC] did to us last year was an embarrassment,” Campanile said. “And honestly, we played pretty poorly today. But we played hard and we found a way to win. A lot of guys contributed and made plays. We’re happy to get a win. It’s tough to get wins in this league.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:20:27.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
