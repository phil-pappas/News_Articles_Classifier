The Ethics Committee must now be allowed to do its work in a robust and timely fashion,\" said the prince who left the executive committee in May when he his challenge to Blatter's reelection failed.\n\"Members of the FIFA Executive Committee should remember that Football Associations, players, coaches and fans the world over are watching.\n\"The Exco should not interfere with an ongoing process that was put in place by the ad hoc electoral committee. The election date of February 26 was set three months ago with a clear procedure that meets all of FIFA’s statutory requirements. Candidates have had plenty of time to declare and still do. The rules should not be changed after the game has started.\"\nPlatini's suspension means that he is not certain to be accepted as a candidate. Another contender Chung Mong-Joon, a South Korean tycoon and former FIFA vice president, has been ruled out of the contest after he was banned for six years by the ethics committee last week.\nAppeals have been made by Blatter, Platini and Chung against their suspensions or exclusions.\nChung, who faced action over his lobbying for South Korea's bid for the 2022 World Cup, went to the FIFA Appeal Committee \"on the same day when the FIFA Ethics Committee announced its decision,\" said his spokesman Lin Byung-Taik.\n\"We are preparing to go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in due process,\" he added.\nIf the election is maintained for February 26, candidates, who need the support of five member associations, have until October 26 to register.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:48:44.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
