Such was the case at the beginning of the Oct. 20 match, eventually won in straight sets by the Golden Knights, 25-18, 25-15. \nOld Tappan jumped out to a 9-0 lead in the first set. Senior Kirsten Kaiser pounded a kill and blocked a shot for the first two points. Junior Maya Illovsky had a pair of aces among her nine service points. Senior co-captains Natalie Alechko and Kelly Brogan blasted kills and Kaiser blocked another shot as many in the lineup contributed to the outburst. \nDEEP BENCH \n\"Our setter, Kelly Brogan, definitely does a great job mixing in everyone,\" said senior Mairead O'Sullivan. \"We obviously have huge power on the outside with Natalie (Alechko) but we also have Kristen Kaiser and Julia [Passante] in the middle. We have Kelly (Brogan) and Maya (Illovsky). We have so many great hitters in the front row and back row that can do amazing things.\" \n\"We have depth,\" added senior co-captain Erika Calabarese. \"Everyone contributes, even if they're not playing. Everyone is playing in practice and if someone gets injured we have someone else to play.\" \nSome of the team's depth is coming from underclassmen. \n\"They're great,\" Barry said of the younger players. \"[Freshman libero] Kelly Chen is the most mature one on the team. We only have one freshman and a bunch of sophomores and juniors coming up. \n\"They're just as mature and we have a lot of confidence in them which makes us a good, diverse team. We have the younger kids that are just as good and we can rely on them too.\" \nLIVELY PRACTICES \nWith such a deep roster some of the Golden Knight practice sessions can become quite spirited at times. \n\"[Coach Melissa] Landeck says that sometimes our practices are more competitive than the games,\" Calabarese said with a smile. \"We're really lucky. When we play 6's it's so competitive. Landeck has to stop and tell us to stop yelling at each other because we get so competitive and everyone is working so hard. That's what makes us better.\" \nNorsewoman senior Veronica Corcoran halted the Golden Knights and senior Faith Hoagland stepped to the service line for Demarest. She calmly reeled off eight straight service winners to cut the Old Tappan lead to 9-8. \n\"We had the momentum, then Demarest got the momentum and we got it back,\" said Calabarese. \"Once we had it we didn't let them get it back and we just took off from there.\" \n\"I think it's indicative of the beginning of a Demarest/Old Tappan match jitters,\" said Landeck. \"They're a better team than us going out to a 9-0 lead and we're a better team than them getting eight [points] right back. Once everybody settled in you saw a truer version of each team.\" \nA kill by Kaiser stopped the Demarest run and gave Old Tappan a 10-8 lead. The teams traded points until Knights senior Brittany Barry smacked a kill to begin a 6-1 run that put some distance between the teams. \nOld Tappan led 20-12. \n\"We were calm but we were a little nervous settling in,\" said Barry. \"We kept our cool, called a timeout, pulled it together, played our game and got it back.\" \n'EACH POINT COUNTS' \nNear the end of the set Alechko tallied three points, including two blasts to score point numbers 24 and 25. \n\"Everyone here is returning varsity except for two of our girls,\" O'Sullivan said. \"We all played with each other last year and there was a little drama. We've come together and matured this year. We know how to play with each other and it's proved to be a success.\" \nDemarest took its first lead of the match in the second set when Corcoran pounded a kill to give the Norsewomen a 2-1 lead. But Old Tappan took the lead for good on a service ace by sophomore Lizzy Chu (to tie the score) and a block by Barry.
