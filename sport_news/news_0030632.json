Six Braves broke 16 minutes and finished in the top 10 at a crisp Darlington County Park as they rolled to the Group B team title. \nLeading the way for Indian Hills was senior Matt Cohane, who finished first in 15:39. Cohane is the lone senior in the pack, the team’s spiritual leader and organizer of the team picture near the finish line. \n“I think today we proved we should be up there,” said Cohane, a Franklin Lakes resident. “I think [being ranked first] was a little unexpected, because when’s the last time you saw Don Bosco not No. 1? But we didn’t really let it affect us.” \nThe Braves took over the top ranking after championship performances at the Shore Coaches Invitational and the Wild Safari Invitational. Next, they will run shoulder to shoulder with the Ironmen (who crushed the field in Group A, even without star Patrick Sullivan) at the Bergen Meet of Champions on Saturday at Darlington. It should be a great battle. \n“We are definitely excited,” said Indian Hills junior Derek Barney, who placed second in 15:41. “We are confident we should do very well.” \n“If we can beat them [Bosco], that would be the ultimate victory,” said Indian Hills junior Thomas Holster, who was fourth in 15:54. \nThe Braves have always had a strong program, but rarely have they had this combination of depth and talent. Longtime Indian Hills coach Tom Zaccone called this team lightning in a bottle. \n“I knew at the beginning of the season we had a lot of potential,” said Cohane. “Just not a lot of experience, but every day since the summer, we were always meeting with each other and we knew that we could do something big this year. Everyone was good training-wise, and all of us got to high mileage that they’d never done before and everyone stayed injury free.” \nThe only part of the training that the Braves changed was keeping their weekly mileage high even during the fall. Some coaches and trainers believe runners should cut back on their mileage to keep their legs fresh for races, but the Braves are still logging over 50 miles a week, according to Holster. \nSaturday, the Braves approached the course confidently. Their biggest challenger in the group was Ridgewood, a team they had already beaten. NV/Old Tappan senior James Weissenborn led the race as they first hit the sand, but had a bevy of Braves behind him. \n“I felt pretty good,” said Barney, “especially in that second mile. We got into a nice groove throughout the whole race.” \n“We came here a couple of days ago and there were acorns everywhere; they did a nice job of cleaning it up,” said Cohane. “The sand is the sand — it wasn’t too bad — but there were some bad parts.” \nBy the time the runners were visible again, it was all Indian Hills white shirts coming around the bend, with Cohane breaking the tape first, and then waiting for his teammates to arrive. \nThe Braves have been so dynamic this season that the coaches wonder to one another about which runner will win, or which of the five boys will count. It seems like every race it’s been different. \n“Last year, we thought we had it made and it didn’t happen,” said Holster. “No one expected this. Then the first race came and Derek and Matt were really good, everyone was under 17 minutes already, and it’s such a bonus because if one person lets them down, another one can pick them up.” \nThe Bergen Meet of Champions will be the Braves’ biggest test to date. One they will be ready for. \n“BMOC is always a great race,” said Cohane. “Tons of fans here, and we just can’t let that get us. How many times do you see people go out fast, and it’s understandable, you come off the sand and there’s this gigantic funnel of fans. Of course we care who’s in the race, but you run your race and we will see what happens.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:05:40.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
