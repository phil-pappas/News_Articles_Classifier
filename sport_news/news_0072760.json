(Elaine Thompson/AP Photo) \nThe Seattle Seahawks have been held up as the shining example for How to Build an NFL Roster the last couple of seasons, and for good reason. General manager John Schneider and his staff are proven masters at finding tremendous value in the later rounds of the NFL draft, having identified future stars like cornerback Richard Sherman (fifth round, 2011), quarterback Russell Wilson (third round, 2012) and safety Kam Chancellor (fifth round, 2010) outside of Round 1. \nThose three players and several others formed the core of a team that won the Super Bowl two seasons ago and came within a play of winning a second last season. \nBut while the Seahawks certainly deserve praise for their ability to find undervalued players, it’s also impossible to ignore that their lack of attention to one particular position group has put them in position to struggle this season. The offensive line has been rather porous this season. (Stephen Brashear/AP Photo) \nRight now, the Seahawks own the worst offensive line in the league. They are PFF’s third-worst run-blocking unit, and rank dead last in pass-protection. None of their five starters has earned a positive grade this season in either facet of the game, and Wilson has been under pressure more than any quarterback in the league. (To his credit, he’s our sixth-ranked quarterback despite getting little help up front.) \nThis poor play is hardly surprising, though, when you consider the team’s lack of investment at the position. For 2015, the Seahawks have the third-lowest amount of cap space committed to their offensive line, and have just $3 million committed to the position in 2016, with left tackle Russell Okung due to come off the books. That’s by far the lowest in the NFL. Compare that to their investment in the secondary where they have the third-most money tied up at the position for 2015, and second-most for 2016. \n[ Fancy Stats: Jets built potent offense the ‘wrong’ way ] \nThat’s before considering their offseason trade of by far their best offensive lineman – center Max Unger – along with their first-round pick to New Orleans for tight end Jimmy Graham. There’s no question that Graham is one of the best receiving tight ends in the league, but he’s also one of the league’s worst blockers. That trade took what was already a vulnerable unit and made it worse. \nWhile this isn’t necessarily the cause of their struggles, it’s worth noting that this is a curious collection of talent. Right guard J.R. Sweezy played defensive tackle in college. So did center Drew Nowak. Right tackle Garry Gilliam played some tight end. Left guard Justin Britt at least played on the offensive line in college, at both left and right tackle for Missouri, but he was something of a surprise pick when Seattle took him in the second round of the 2014 draft. \nAgain, we’re talking more about correlation than causation here, but it’s a fair question for Seahawks fans to ask: What the heck is this team doing with its offensive line? \nTo a certain extent, it’s easy to see the rationale. Seattle has a very talented defensive backfield that fits perfectly within their scheme, so they’ve invested more heavily at that position. That requires spending less elsewhere, and in Wilson, one of the league’s most mobile QBs, and Lynch, who produced more yardage independent of his blocking than any running back in the NFL last year, they have two playmakers uniquely suited to overcome a subpar offensive line. \nThe problem is that this year “subpar” has become “worst in the league,” and in the rare instances when the secondary doesn’t play at an elite level – and there’s no question that these first six games have been rougher than expected for them – the offense isn’t performing well enough to make up for it. \nBy investing such little attention (and money) at the offensive line position, they’ve left themselves with almost no room for error, making a playoff push far harder than it should be for a team coming off two straight Super Bowl appearances. sports Success!
