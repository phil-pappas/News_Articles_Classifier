NO. 5 BAYLOR (3-0, 0-0) 2:30 p.m. Saturday, AT&T Stadium (Ch. 8)\nKliff Kingsbury knows offense.\nThe Texas Tech coach and former quarterback also fully understands what his defense will face Saturday in trying to slow down Baylor at AT&T Stadium.\n\"Baylor does what they do,\" Kingsbury said. \"Nobody in the country does what they do -- the way they space you out, run the ball very well, play up-tempo and find ways to get those receivers to the ball in space.\"\nIn this case, Kingsbury hasn't crossed over into the usual coaching hyperbole. No. 5 Baylor (3-0) is tops in the Football Bowl Subdivision in total offense and scoring offense, probably not a surprise given its talent level and less-than-threatening non-conference schedule.\nMore striking is that the Bears are averaging 387.3 yards passing and a nation-leading 379.7 yards rushing, remarkable balance for a spread team.\n\"So you tell me what you want me to stop and I'll try,\" Tech defensive coordinator David Gibbs said. \"Let me rephrase that ... I'll call a defense that's supposed to stop it. And then they'll run it anyway. They're phenomenal. We got our hands full again.\"\nIf Tech has any hopes of an upset, it must at least try for a few stops. Despite amassing 750 yards total offense in a 55-52 win, TCU still had to punt four times.\nTech was within a fourth-down stop late in the game of a monumental upset.\n\"Again, we gotta give our offense a chance to win the game at the end,\" Gibbs said. \"That's our goal.\"\nBaylor may be even more of a challenge. In its last nine games, no team has held the Bears under 38 points.\nDuring a four-game winning streak against Tech in Arlington, Baylor has averaged 57.3 points and 628.3 yards offense per game.\nRedshirt senior defensive lineman Branden Jackson has witnessed all four of the Baylor games and understands the book more than most on trying to disrupt Baylor and new quarterback Seth Russell.\n\"We have to disrupt their timing,\" Jackson said. \"We've got to get back there to Russell and kind of get him off his game. Also, penetrate that big, talented offensive line and slow them down.\"\nTech has fallen to 122nd of 127th teams in total defense, allowing 556.3 yards per game, and 120th in third down conversion defense. While Tech had forced turnovers in its first three games, it came up empty against TCU.\nGibbs still sees growth.\n\"I think they learned if they'll just keep fighting and keep playing we'll have a chance to win a whole bunch of football games,\" Gibbs said. \"They don't have to be perfect. And I think sometimes when you're trying to rebuild a defense, you know, I think sometimes guys, they overreact and they panic.\"\nTech may have to dip into an emotional reserve after the road win at Arkansas and crushing loss to TCU. For the first time in school history, Tech will be facing Top 5 teams in consecutive games.\n\"You get an opportunity to play in an NFL stadium, against a Top 5 team,\" Kingsbury said. \"It's a bowl atmosphere with a split down the middle. If you can't get fired up for this, you got issues.\n\"So they'll be ready to go.\"\nTwitter: @ChuckCarltonDMN\nBaylor dominance Breaking down Baylor's offensive production during a four-game winning streak against Texas Tech at AT&T Stadium: Year Result Total off. 2011 66-42 617 2012 52-45, OT 674 2013 63-34 675 2014 48-46 547", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:51:13.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
