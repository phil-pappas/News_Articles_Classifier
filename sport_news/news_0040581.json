He was moving around the pitch well, but unfortunately he felt some discomfort and we are going to lose him.\" \nMartino says it is a different injury to the one Aguero was carrying with his club. \nAguero scored five goals in 20 minutes in his last game for City â€” a 6-1 win over Newcastle that returned his team to the top of the Premier League.
