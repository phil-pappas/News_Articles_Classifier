But most importantly what happened was a hit, a hit he needed on that surgically repaired left shoulder. \n\"[On] the first play, actually,\" Love said after registering six points, four rebounds and two assists in 13 minutes. \"So that was a good thing and a bad thing. It's been tested a number of times in practice. I keep working on my strength. I'm sure there will be a few scares here and there, but that's kind of the mentality, just getting over the hump.\" \nThat moment, the realization that the once separated shoulder is going to be fine was vital for his confidence. It allows for him to play worry-free basketball. And you can tell that's what he did in his limited time during a game in which the Cavaliers lost 87-81 to fall to 0-6 in preseason. \nLove was agile, full of energy and wasn't hesitant with his attack moves. \nHe called for the ball in the post and knocked down his first two shots on face-up, step-back jumpers over Luis Scola. Scola was off balance defensively due to the quick feet of Love. \nThe three-time All-Star showboated a little with one beautiful pass he flipped behind his back effortlessly to Mo Williams, who nailed a left corner 3-pointer. \n\"I did not realize that's what he added to his repertoire, but they were successful,\" amused Cavs coach David Blatt said. \"So, who knows, maybe he's deepening his game.\" \nLove also showed off his rocket arms with his patented two-handed outlet pass that went to Matthew Dellavedova near halfcourt and then lobbed to Timofey Mozgov for the alley-oop slam. \n\"My body felt better than it has in a long time,\" he said. \"It's a good first step.\" \nLove did, however, clank his last five shots. That's where rust was a factor, but his conditioning was impressive. \n\"I can tell you that physically, he's in good of shape as he's ever been,\" Blatt said. \"And you can see it on him too. You can see it on his body; you can see it on the way he moves. He really, really worked hard.\" \nLove will play and start in tonight's game against the Dallas Mavericks at The Q, the exhibition finale. It will give the team more of a glimpse of what he's capable of doing this early on. \nIt will also give fans another glimpse of his longer-than-usual curly hair and black headband he's sporting these days. He said he's growing his hair out and the headband is staying to keep his hair from getting in his face. \nIt's a new look, but he's got the same game. It can only get better from here out. \n\"My body feels great and I work with a lot of great people here and I owe that to them,\" he said. \"Hopefully I will continue to do that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:16:37.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
