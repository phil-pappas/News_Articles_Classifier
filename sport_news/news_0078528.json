(AP Photo/Gary Wiepert) more > By -   \nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Adam Henrique scored twice and added an assist and the New Jersey Devils won their fourth straight with a 4-3 victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night. \nMike Cammalleri had a goal and two assists, and David Schlemko also scored for the Devils. New Jersey hasn’t lost since starting the season 0-3-1. \nTyler Ennis, Ryan O’Reilly and Jack Eichel scored for Buffalo. Goaltender Linus Ullmark made his NHL debut for the Sabres (2-6-0). \nBuffalo lost Evander Kane to a left knee injury midway through the third period. A high-profile addition last season, Kane needed to be helped off the ice and did not return. Coach Dan Bylsma did not have an update on Kane’s condition. \nCammalleri’s goal tied it 2-2 8:57 into the second, and then Schlemko put New Jersey ahead with 49 seconds left in the period. \nAbout midway through the third, Ennis mishandled a puck at the Devils’ blue line, and Henrique scored on a shorthanded breakaway with a backhand shot past Ullmark. \nThe Sabres thought they had scored 6:54 into the first when David Legwand was tripped by Eric Gelinas, pushing goalie Cory Schneider and the puck into the net. A review upheld the no-goal call. \nBuffalo scored moments later on a power play when Ennis sent a slap shot through traffic that flew under Schneider’s glove to make it 1-0. \nThe Devils tied it just before the break. Buffalo native Lee Stempniak forced a shot through traffic that Ullmark pushed wide. Cammalleri found the rebound and threw a wayward backhand toward the crease, where it skittered off Josh Gorges for Henrique to tap home. \nO’Reilly then scored on a backhand slap at a loose puck that was redirected in by Schneider - the goalie had lost his stick and punched at the puck with his blocker hand. \nNew Jersey evened things when Sergey Kalinin carried the puck around the Sabres defense and had his shot kicked away by Ullmark. Cammalleri latched onto the rebound and slotted it past the Sabres goaltender. \nUllmark used his shoulder to pop a Henrique shot over the net during a Devils possession midway through the second. \nSchneider then made his own strong save, keeping his left pad strong on the post to hold off Nicolas Deslauriers’ redirection of Jake McCabe’s shot from the point. He also stopped a partial breakaway from Zemgus Girgensons before the period was over. \nA nifty string of passes gave New Jersey its first lead, as Schlemko crept in from the right point to slide a low pass from Cammalleri past Ullmark. \nThe Sabres pulled Ullmark when Brian O’Neill took a hooking penalty with 2:29 to play. Eichel then scored on a low snap shot from the slot, but Buffalo couldn’t find the equalizer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:14:17.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
