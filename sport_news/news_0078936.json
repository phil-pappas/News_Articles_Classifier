Current Red Devils boss Louis Van Gaal gave Muller his first opportunity to impress when he managed the German champions but has said that a move to England is “not up for discussion”. \nLast season the Barclay’s Premier League had the fewest number of home-grown players in the top 5 league in Europe, at 35%. \nSpain leads this with 58%, closely followed by France with 56%. Germany is third on this list with 48% and Italy is fourth with 43% - which is still 8% higher than the Premier League. \nThe first season of the BPL (1992/93) 69% of all the players were English. \nMuller has been on fire this season after playing more centre forward role, scoring 11 goals in as many games in the Champions League and the Bundesliga. \nManchester United’s strikers faced extreme scrutiny this season, with the Wayne Rooney scoring only six goals in nine months, and the other two (Anthony Martial and James Wilson) being just 19 years old.
