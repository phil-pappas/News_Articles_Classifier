But he says it won't show up in the record books.\nEinck says an agent called to a hunting club Saturday to measure the antlers wound up arresting 40-year-old Glen Toups Jr. of Abbeville and confiscating the deer.\nEinck says Toups was cited with hunting without deer tags or hunting licenses. Einck says a charge of hunting after license revocation is pending because investigators didn't learn about that until after the arrest.\nToups declined comment Monday.\nOnline:\nLouisiana record list: http://1.usa.gov/1OERfqn\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
