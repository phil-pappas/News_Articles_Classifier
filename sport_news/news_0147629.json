With eight states rooting for them, it's no surprise to see NorthEast United FC (NEUFC) possibly commanding the largest fan base in the league. Supporters were let down last season as the Guwahati-based team finished at the bottom of the table. With plenty of changes in the team ahead of the second season, the 'Highlanders' aim to finish as high as the region's expectations.\nChanges in the John Abraham co-owned side saw them replace Ricki Herbert with Cesar Faria â€“ who guided Venezuela to the semifinals of Copa America in 2011. This move could work wonders as the Venezuelan is a big fan of the Latin American style of football, which involves possession play.\nLeading the charge on the home front will be Manipuri lad Boithang Haokip. The 24-year-old is regarded as one of the best dead-ball specialists in the country and his role in the centre-midfield will be crucial.\nNEUFC made some major signings and announced former Portuguese star Simao Sabrosa as their marquee player for the second season. The winger is expected to bring in tons of experience. He has already shown what he is capable of, having scored twice in the three pre-season friendlies this summer.\nNew recruits Diomansy Kamara, Francis Dadzie and Nicolas Velez will add some bite to their attacking options but their forward line stands nowhere when compared to the likes of Atletico de Kolkata, Delhi Dynamos and Chennaiyin FC.\nWhat may seem as a good move to blend in local talent might be NorthEast United's biggest weakness. With the average age of the side being only 24, lack of experience could be a telling factor for a side with very few senior Indian players in the team.\nKNOW YOUR TEAM\nNorthEast United FC\nCoach: Cesar Farias\nLAST SEASON (GROUP STAGE)\nPlayed: 14\nWon: 3\nDraw: 6\nLost: 5\nGoals scored: 11\nGoals conceded: 13\nTop goalscorer: Koke (4)\nRETAINED PLAYERS\nForeigners: Miguel Garcia, Kondwani Mtonga\nIndians: Rehenesh TP, Aiborlang Khonjee, Robin Gurung, Alen Deory, Boithang Haokip\nPLAYERS SIGNED\nForeigners: Cedric Hengbart, Bruno, Silas, Diomansy Kamara, Nicolas Velez, Gennaro Bracigiliano, Francis Dadzie, Boubacar Sanogo, Simao Sabrosa\nIndians: Marlangki Suting, Zohmingliana Ralte, Yumnam Raju, Sanju Pradhan, Holicharan Narzary, Seityasen Singh, Reagen Singh, Siam Hanghai, Lalthuammawia Ralte", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:33:47.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
