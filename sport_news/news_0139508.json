It’s just going to take more time than the senior, or his Cougar teammates, would like. \n“We have heart, we don’t stop playing,” Carney said following his team’s 34-13 loss to visiting Penns Grove Friday night in a West Jersey Football League Diamond Division matchup that was delayed twice for a total of 90 minutes by lightning strikes. \n“We should steal some games in the second half of the season. But we need to execute and make smart plays ... not the dumb ones like we made tonight.” \nThe plays Carney was referring to are really a product of the Cougars being thrust into roles that they don’t have a great deal of experience in, rather than a lack of hustle. Junior Noah Gilchrist was the latest player to line up under center, the team's fourth quarterback in as many games, and he didn’t perform badly. \nGilchrist showed some moxie in completing 7-of-17 passes for 71 yards, including a 22-yard touchdown strike late in the contest to Jared Golembski. He was picked off twice and sacked four times, and many of his issues appeared to deal with timing. \n“I told Noah that there’d be so many things he’d see in the game film,” said Schalick coach Seth Brown. “He was our original backup QB but got hurt in the Delsea scrimmage. He’ll continue to get better.” \nSchalick (0-4) had a tough time defending Red Devils quarterback Ja’yon Mejias, who was 12-of-24 passing for 251 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Kimere Brown reeled in both scores, on receptions of 19 and 5 yards. Mejias also scored on a 4-yard keeper as Penns Grove built an 18-0 lead at the intermission. \nThe Cougars focused on containing Penns Grove’s running game, which has traditionally been the visiting team’s bread and butter. Naturally, the Red Devils looked like acrobats catching the ball. \n“We have to load so many people in the box to stop the run and it leaves the cornerbacks on an island,” Brown noted. “We didn’t stop them consistently enough.” \nSamej Moore added a pair of rushing TDs for the Red Devils (4-1). \nBrown was encouraged with Schalick’s running game. Carney chalked up 59 yards on the ground and Tywyl Garner chipped in with 38, including a 1-yard scoring plunge as the final seconds melted away. \nThe veteran coach now must focus on Woodrow Wilson, which will host the Cougars next Saturday, and hope to gradually minimize the little mistakes that have resulted in huge consequences. \n“We continue to get better. I’m proud that they didn’t quit,” Brown said. “They’re going to execute and we’re going to get it.” \nPenns Grove 34, Schalick 13 \nPenns Grove (4-1) 6 12 8 8 — 34 \nSchalick (0-4) 0 0 0 13 — 13 \nScoring \nPG: Brown 19 pass from Mejias (pass failed) \nPG: Mejias 4 run (pass failed) \nPG: Moore 1 run (run failed) \nPG: Brown 5 pass from Mejias (Robinson pass from Mejias) \nPG: Moore 6 run (Jones run) \nS: Golembski 22 pass from Gilchrist (Long kick) \nS: Garner 1 run (kick failed) \nTeam Stats Penns Grove Schalick \nFirst Downs 14 9", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:59:10.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
