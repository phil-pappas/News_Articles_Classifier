The Dodgers had just clinched their third consecutive NL West title and Manager Don Mattingly was asked to compare this team to the previous two.\n“A lot more professional this year,” Mattingly said. “I never really worried about them being ready to play. I could trust them. They got down to business on the field and that was a good feeling for me.”\nMattingly’s answer was a compliment to the business-like approach and work ethic of holdovers Adrian Gonzalez, Clayton Kershaw and A.J. Ellis as well as newcomers such as Howie Kendrick and Jimmy Rollins among others. It also made an obvious allusion to what was lacking the previous two years – when “Mickey Mouse stuff” (Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright’s pejorative), bubble machines and pool parties defined the team’s personality.\n“Well, Jimmy, Chase (Utley), Howie … guys that have been through it and kind of have a – show up, do their job, play to win, that kind of mentality,” Gonzalez said, echoing Mattingly’s assessment. “Obviously we didn’t have those guys last year or the year before. I’m not comparing one to the other. I’m just saying this year we have those guys that we didn’t have last year.\n“I’m just saying I like that. I’m not going to give you today vs. the past. I’ll talk about today.”\nGonzalez doesn’t have to. The subtractions are obvious. For good or bad – too often bad – the personalities of Hanley Ramirez, Matt Kemp, Yasiel Puig and Brian Wilson (in 2014) dominated the room. Ramirez, Kemp and Wilson are all gone (at some expense in the case of Kemp and Wilson, who still cost the Dodgers $27.5 million this season). Puig’s multiple hamstring injuries took him out of the Dodgers’ clubhouse for weeks at a time this season.\n“Well, there’s only so many people that left. So you can do the math if you want to,” said outfielder Scott Van Slyke, one of 11 players (including Hyun-Jin Ryu, who spent the season on the DL) who have been on each of the Dodgers’ three consecutive NL West title teams. “The guys who left were good teammates. Just like any teammate, they’re going to do things that bug you. They’re going to do things the way you wouldn’t do it. Does it make right that they do it that way? No. But does it make them overall somebody that’s going to bring down the club? I don’t think so.”\nDodgers reliever J.P. Howell, another three-timer, agreed, saying, “You can look at the subtractions but it’s not all of them. Some of them were tough to let go. And some of them weren’t.”\nHowell was more definitive about the professionalism that has replaced the clashing agendas of the past two seasons.\n“It wasn’t even there. It wasn’t around,” Howell said. “A lot of talent and a lot of emotions. No one could check their own emotions. Here, it’s ‘If you’re not in, dude, then you’ve got to go.’ That’s how it feels. No matter how good you are, if you’re not pulling on the rope then you gotta get out of the way because you’re messing this up.”\nMessed up as the clubhouse dynamic might have been the past two years (and it was messed up enough to provide fodder for at least one book) the Dodgers won 186 games in those two seasons and one is hard-pressed to point to anything that played out on the field as evidence it was the reason they failed in the post-season – or that this year’s more “professional” group is thus better-equipped to get to the franchise’s first World Series since 1988.\n“The one thing is a lot of bad habits are brought into the postseason. A lot of negative thoughts,” Howell said. “I’m a believer in will and good energy and that wasn’t happening. I believe in that. I do.\n“It’s one of those things with team chemistry. During the year, whether we made the playoffs or not, I was happy with the way things were going. I won 90-some games here in 2013 and it was the least amount of fun I’ve had in my life.\n“It was stressful. It wasn’t fun. It wasn’t how I like to do it. And I think it matters how you do it. I’m proud to be a part of this ballclub. I haven’t had any experiences this year that come remotely close to the past two years.”\nEllis said he knew things were different as early as the first day of full-squad workouts in spring training, when he saw Rollins and Kendrick lead the team through a practice drill.\n“We got on and off that field in that mundane, terrible drill because those guys did it the right way,” Ellis said. “I still remember that.”\nThat mentality does translate to a more playoff-ready team, Ellis maintains.\n“The Cardinals were more mentally tough than us two straight years,” Ellis said of the Dodgers’ NLDS and NLCS losses. “I know for a fact this team is in a much better place as a team. And not just chemistry-wise, but because this is a team that plays that way every day, plays with that edge, that approach, that ‘We’re going to make you fight for 27 outs.’”\nGonzalez steadfastly refuses to be drawn into any comparisons of the Dodgers’ playoff entries.\n“I don’t want to make it ‘this year vs. last year,’” he said. “I don’t think it should ever be that because every year is different. Look at this year. We lost in the past because we lost. If we win this year, we win this year.\n“You want a formula for success? I’ll give you the formula. Pitchers have to pitch. Hitters have to get clutch hits. And you have to make the plays on defense. That’s the formula.”\nContact the writer: bplunkett@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:29:30.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
