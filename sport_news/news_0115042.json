(Mike Ehrmann / Getty Images) Christy Cabrera Chirinos Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel 'Canes keeping emotions in check, but know Clemson presents big opportunity \nIn the days leading up to their annual rivalry game with Florida State, many of the Hurricanes insisted — more than once — that they were trying to approach the matchup as if they were facing any other ACC opponent on their schedule. \nTwo weeks later, as Miami prepares to face its second top-10 team in three weeks, the message has been somewhat the same. Yes, players know sixth-ranked Clemson is unbeaten. Yes, they know all about the talent the Tigers have on both sides of the ball and yes, they understand what's at stake, especially after having already lost one conference game. \nBut they insist — again — that they can't afford to make Saturday's noon showdown with Clemson at Sun Life Stadium any bigger than it is. Instead, the goal, as it has been all season, is for the Hurricanes to focus on themselves and how they can play better, nothing else. \n\"It's about the guys in our room right now. It's just about them,\" said Miami quarterback Brad Kaaya, who enters Saturday's game as the ACC's leading passer with 1,795 yards. \"We're just focusing on Clemson, not focusing on the rankings or what [college football analyst] Kirk Herbstreit is saying, what Chris Fowler is saying or what any of the analysts are saying, really. We're just focusing on what they're giving us on film and taking it from there.\" \nAdded safety Deon Bush: \"Every week, our message to the team is to work on ourselves. Right now, we're basically working on our self improvements and then whoever steps in front of us, we're just going to play them.\" \nBut even with that as the focus, there's no denying the Hurricanes have a massive opportunity Saturday. \nMiami (4-2, 1-1) hasn't beaten a top-10 team since 2009, when the then 17th-ranked Hurricanes upset No. 8 Oklahoma, which was playing without quarterback Sam Bradford. It's been even longer since an unranked Miami team managed the same feat. \nThat win came in 1998 when Edgerrin James ran for 299 yards and Miami shocked third-ranked UCLA 49-45 in a classic game at the Orange Bowl. On that day, in their regular-season finale, the Hurricanes snapped the Bruins' 20-game win streak and derailed UCLA's national championship hopes. \nThey stand in an eerily similar situation now. \nClemson (6-0, 3-0) enters Saturday's game with a nine-game win streak dating back to last season and is eyeing a spot in the College Football Playoff — a spot that would be jeopardized if the Hurricanes manage the big win they and beleaguered coach Al Golden have been chasing for years. \nOn the flip side, if Miami falls against Clemson, the Hurricanes will further hurt their chances of achieving their long-stated goal of winning the Coastal Division crown and playing for the conference championship. And the drumbeat from fans and former players angry with Golden's performance at Miami will only continue to get louder. \nBut as has been par for the course all season in Coral Gables, there's been little talk of any of that. \nInstead, Miami has set to try and fix its offensive line issues. The Hurricanes have talked about wanting to jump-start their running game, which has seen its productivity slide against FSU and Virginia Tech. And there's been plenty of praise for the team Clemson is bringing to Sun Life Stadium, a team that features quarterback Deshaun Watson, the preseason ACC Player of the Year, tight end Jordan Leggett, wide receiver Artavis Scott and running back Wayne Gallman. \nThough Kaaya leads the conference in several offensive categories, Watson is not far behind throwing for 1,410 yards and 14 touchdowns while rushing for 292 yards and two more scores on 56 carries. \nHe and the rest of Clemson's offense will pose a challenge for the Hurricanes, who have at times given up big plays. Virginia Tech managed seven plays of more than 20 yards last week, and the Hurricanes can't let that happen against Clemson. \n\"They're an explosive team,\" Golden said. \"He throws a great deep ball, vertical ball and those guys go up and get it. When you try to stay on top of that, they've got the skill guys on the perimeter that can catch something a little bit shorter and make you miss. The running back's really good … they are who they are for a reason. A good team.\" \nccabrera@tribpub.com ; On Twitter @ChristyChirinos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:20:16.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
