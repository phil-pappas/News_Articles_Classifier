Even I, a 35-year Oregon resident who deeply mourns the victims, would not go to Roseburg to intrude on the very real and very deep private grief of the families. His presence or rhetoric is not needed at this time.\nPlease, Mr. President, stay home!\nRamona Tweed\nCrooked River Ranch\n•\nObama in Roseburg: Shame on President Barack Obama for politicizing the Umpqua Community College tragedy! But let's not stop there. Shame on those who blame the tobacco industry for lung cancer deaths. Shame on those who seek investigations of food producers when lives are lost due to a breakout of E. coli. Shame on those who suggest that laws be strengthened after an environmental disaster.\nSome gun advocates have taken the high road by demanding that the only appropriate response to such tragedies is to show respect for the families of those whose lives have been lost. A better role model than Obama would be Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, who posted a video on Facebook suggesting that Sandy Hook was a government plot to take guns away from citizens.\nDavid Dickson\nSouthwest Portland\n•\nSecond Amendment: In keeping with the Second Amendment, Oregon should have a \"well regulated Militia,\" which every citizen has the constitutional right to join — and, in fact, is drafted into by owning any firearm. The duties shouldn't be too onerous but should still involve a yearly mental health checkup, safety classes and perhaps some training on police coordination in case of a statewide emergency, such as a major earthquake.\nGun control advocates should stop pretending the Second Amendment doesn't exist. But to an even greater degree, firearm advocates need to stop pretending the first half of it doesn't exist. The Founding Fathers mentioned militias for a reason, and it's high time that firearm use be associated with keeping the peace, not random violence.\nSteven Maurer\nAloha\n•\nSecond Amendment: Imagine if, as a consequence of the upcoming presidential election, a refreshed future Supreme Court reaffirmed United States v. Miller (1939), in which the court ruled that the Second Amendment protects arms that have a \"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.\" Then we could require all suitable citizens to be enrolled in the Oregon National Guard. Keyword being \"suitable.\"\nI would rather trust my state to not deploy me overseas than trust in the National Rifle Association. Seriously, why do the feds classify marijuana like heroin, while barely regulated gun possession remains legally sacrosanct? Which exercise of individual liberty kills more people?\nSteve Rice\nSoutheast Portland\n•\nSecond Amendment: It's time for a national conversation on the mental health of gun enthusiasts. What sort of person gets this excited about contraptions that have the sole purpose of shredding human flesh? Do they really believe they have a prayer of taking on the U.S. government in the \"last days\" after the rapture? We need some way of distinguishing the stalwart, suburban homestead protectors, the hunters, hobbyists and Civil War history buffs (not to mention all those relentless killers of farm vermin) from the guys who spend all evening twirling their guns and pointing them at the bedroom mirror saying, \"You talkin' to me?\"\nGerhard Magnus\nNorthwest Portland\n•\nAsperger's syndrome: As more information has been made public regarding the shooter at Umpqua Community College, much is being said about the gunman having been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, along with talk of mental illness. The press and the public need to be aware that Asperger's is not a mental illness; it is a neurological and behavioral condition. Of course, it is entirely possible that a person with Asperger's can also have raging anger, poor social skills, negative life experiences and difficulty solving personal problems and managing feelings.\nMy teenage grandson, who has Asperger's, is a super smart, kindhearted, polite, thoughtful and delightful person with a great sense of humor and lots of friends. I would be crushed if people labeled him as mentally ill and expected that he would commit a heinous crime like the one that has occurred.\nPlease do not make the mistake of blaming the shooting on Asperger's syndrome. It is my hope that people will not connect the syndrome with a person's poor judgment and inappropriate, criminal behavior.\nHow about giving less attention to the shooter's Asperger's syndrome and focusing instead on his mental and behavioral experiences and condition?\nMarilyn Donovan\nGladstone", "external_links": ["https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/307/174/case.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:07:58.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
