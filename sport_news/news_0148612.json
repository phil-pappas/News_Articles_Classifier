In order for that to happen, their goalie has to be spot on after going 35-12-5 with a 2.38 goals-against average last season. Plus, Andersen is being pushed in the organization by John Gibson, who’ll start the season in the AHL to further his development.\n* Matt Beleskey: The ex-Duck left wing cashed in on his 22 goals and 10 assists last season with a five-year, $19 million deal with the Bruins. Considering Beleskey, 27, had never scored more than 11 goals prior to last season, it’s a $19 million gamble.\n* Jamie Benn: Nothing but great things is expected from the Stars center, who led the NHL with 87 points last season. But the preseason MVP candidate also is a lynchpin to the Stars’ heightened expectations with the acquisitions of goalie Antti Niemi, left wing Patrick Sharp and defenseman Johnny Oduya, all recent Cup winners with the Blackhawks.\n* Devan Dubnyk: The goalie, 29, never proved to be a No. 1 in previous stops with the Oilers and Coyotes but, traded to the Wild last season, he went 27-9-2 with a 1.78 goals-against average. The Wild rewarded him with a six-year, $26 million deal, betting they saw the real Dubnyk.\n* Mike Green: Head injuries slowed his career with the Capitals, where he was once one of the most dangerous offensive-minded defensemen in the NHL. Still only 29 and now with the Red Wings, whose streak of 24 straight playoff appearances could be in jeopardy, Green is getting a fresh start.\n* Ken Hitchcock: A slow start will almost certainly cost Hitchcock his job as Blues coach.\n* Claude Julien: Ditto for the Bruins coach.\n* Phil Kessel: Joining the Penguins, he could score 50 goals on Sidney Crosby’s right wing. Or he could frustrate a third organization after indifferent performances with the Maple Leafs and Bruins.\n* Ryan O’Reilly: Legal issues aside, the 24-year-old ex-Avalanche center will be under plenty of pressure with the new-look Sabres, now coached by Dan Bylsma. The Sabres are paying him $52.5 million over seven seasons to be a leader.\n* Cam Talbot: Can Henrik Lundqvist’s former understudy, 27, traded to the Oilers, turn his first chance to be a team’s No. 1 goalie into a lucrative new contract while backstopping the new \"it\" team with No. 1 overall pick Connor McDavid?\nEmail: grossa@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:10:58.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
