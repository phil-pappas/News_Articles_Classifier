Griffin admitted to being surprised by the team's decision to have him suit up in Week 6 after five straight healthy scratches to start the season.\nAdChoices\n“I’m here to support; support the team, whoever’s starting, whoever’s playing. So, that’s not my call,” Griffin said to reporters after the game. “I was not expecting it. You obviously come in here and expect to win, so I wasn’t expecting that at all.”\nStarting quarterback Kirk Cousins struggled with interceptions again, but Griffin refused to take the bait when reporters asked him about the possibility of seeing him regain the starting quarterback job.\n“Nah, man, I’m not going to talk about myself, our team, we need to win next week,” Griffin said. “That’s all we’re focused on. I’m not focused on what I’ve had to go through or anything like that. We’re just focused on Tampa Bay for next week. Get ready to go. We’ve got to get a win before the bye.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:40:12.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
