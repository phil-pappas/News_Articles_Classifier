Picture: Sarah Reed \nADELAIDE 36ers coach Joey Wright said winning the ­rebounding against Perth was essential for a second straight NBL victory at Adelaide Arena. \nThat, coupled with some ­extended pressure would ­generate the fast break points synonymous with any Sixers success. \nBut it was the Wildcats who won the boards in every quarter for a commanding 50-36 edge and when run was required, they turned on the afterburners and left the 36ers choking on their fumes, winning 79-66.

Then Jermaine Beal — Adelaide’s nemesis in the 2014 Grand Final — made it back-to-back threes, an off-the-ball foul giving Redhage two additional free throws. \nWhen Beal stole the ball from Ebi Ere for 73-63, it was over, Perth’s star guard with 12 last quarter points in his 18-point game-high.
