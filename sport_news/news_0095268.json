This will be the case for the next 3 days.\nExpect partly cloudy skies, overcast at times, with less than a 10 percent chance of rain. The pattern will shift late Sunday as the weather in Texas will pull our way with a cool front.\nRain chances ramp up late Sunday through Tuesday night.\nRain chances go away Wednesday as a stronger cold front moves through and dries us out.\nFollow me on Twitter: @Bruce KatzFOX8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:59:09.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
