No. 27 will make them state champions.\nThe Saints advanced to Friday's Division 2-AA title match with a 25-15, 25-14, 26-28, 25-21 victory over Chattanooga Baylor Thursday in Murfreesboro. The victory sets up a 10:30 a.m. final against Nashville Father Ryan at the Murphy Center on the campus of Middle Tennessee State.\nBriarcrest (45-4) has defeated Father Ryan three times this year, including Tuesday's tournament opener.\n\"That was the first time they had their big hitter Lauren (Dorrell, who will play at Colorado),\" Saints coach Carla Anderton said. \"I expected her to be on fire ... and they're going to have hundreds of fans there. But we've done a good job all year of not overlooking anybody.\"\nThe Saints controlled the first two games against Baylor before dropping the third. Baylor then had a 17-11 lead in the fourth before the Saints reeled of a 14-4 victory to close the match and move them to within one victory of their first state title since 2003.\n\"We missed some serves in the third set,\" Anderton said. \"But they showed a lot of character to finish it out.\"\nHarding will also play for a title Friday.\nThe Lions fell to nationally ranked Knoxville Webb (25-23, 25-21, 25-19) in the morning before knocking off St. George's (25-17, 25-23, 25-19) in an elimination match. Harding (40-7) will face Webb for the D2-A championship at 9 a.m. as it tries to win its first title since 2008.\nIn AAA, Houston battled through the loser's bracket to reach the semifinals before falling.\nThe Mustangs — who won a late match against Ooltewah on Wednesday to stave off elimination — started the day with a 25-21, 25-23, 25-19 victory over Knoxville Bearden. They then fell in five to Farragut (losing the final game 15-13) to end their ninth trip to state in 10 years with a fourth-place finish.\n\"My girls are awesome and played their hearts out,\" Mustangs coach Becky Pendleton tweeted after the match.\nARLINGTON WINS REGION 7 SOCCER\nArlington won the Region 7-AAA tournament title, getting an overtime goal from Erin Young to defeat Bartlett 1-0.\nThe Tigers (13-3-0) will host Collierville in a AAA sectional match Saturday, while the Panthers will face Houston at Houston Middle School. The winners of those matches advance to next week's AAA state tournament in Murfreesboro.\nHARDING FOOTBALL STANDOUT HONORED\nColton Nash, an offensive and defensive lineman on the Harding Jr. High football team, has been selected to play for the U.S. Junior National team, which will take on Canada in the International Bowl in February.\nNash was named the top lineman at the USA camp in Nashville over the summer, earning him an invitation to the USA National Football Games in Canton, Ohio. From there, he was picked for the national team.\nThe International Bowl takes place Feb. 3 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Nash will be joined on the squad by ECS quarterback Jack Stephens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:34:00.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
