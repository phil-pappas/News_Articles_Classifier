But celebrity website TMZ.com, which broke the news of the emergency, cited unidentified sources yesterday as saying Odom was in a coma and that some of his organs were failing. \nKardashian, whose whirlwind romance with Odom was captured in the reality show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and its spin-off “Khloe and Lamar” is at his bedside, TMZ and Us Weekly reported. The couple split in 2013 after four years of marriage and their divorce was finalized in July. \nThe owner of the Love Ranch, Dennis Hof, said Odom had arrived at the legal brothel on Saturday. “He was polite and reserved and he told multiple employees that he was there to get some privacy and spend some time relaxing,” Hof said in an email.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:45:46.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
