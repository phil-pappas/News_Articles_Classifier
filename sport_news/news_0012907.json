Jerry Brown and his wife, Anne Gust Brown, outside the Governor's Mansion in Sacramento back in 2014. They’ll be moving into the mansion once renovation work has been completed. José Luis Villegas Sacramento Bee file i \ndsiders@sacbee.com \nGov. Jerry Brown, who chose an apartment over mansion life when he was governor before, now plans to move into the historic Governor’s Mansion in downtown Sacramento, likely late this year or early next year. \nHis move will follow the completion of a months-long renovation of the residence, which is expected to be finished by the end of the year, Brown’s office said. \nThe governor and his wife, Anne Gust Brown, will give up their rented loft in downtown Sacramento. \nThe mansion, purchased by the state in 1903 and now maintained as a state park and museum, has not housed a governor since Ronald Reagan in 1967. \nWhen Brown signed a budget last year that included $2.5 million for renovations at the mansion, his office said he had “no immediate plans” to move in. That appeared to change this year, however, with an additional $1.6 million appropriated for the project and the renovation growing to include security improvements. The administration considered the building a possible home for Brown and future governors. \nCalifornia is one of only a handful of states without a permanent governor’s residence – the lack of which has been a source of consternation for years to Sacramento-based politicians. \nThe historic mansion housed 13 governors before falling into disrepair. After Ronald and Nancy Reagan moved out of the building in 1967, Reagan supporters built a new mansion in Carmichael. But Reagan left office before he could move in, and his successor, Brown, chose to live in an apartment on N Street instead. \nIn more recent years, Gov. George Deukmejian, Pete Wilson and Gray Davis lived in a ranch home in the Lake Wilhaggin neighborhood east of the city. Arnold Schwarzenegger stayed in a suite at the Hyatt Regency Sacramento. \nFunds for the historic mansion’s renovation are from proceeds from the sale of the Carmichael mansion, Brown’s office said. \nBrown now splits time between his home in Oakland and an upscale loft in downtown Sacramento. \nBrown never lived in the old mansion. His father, Edmund G. “Pat” Brown, was elected governor in 1958, after Brown had left home for seminary and college. But he studied for the California bar exam at the mansion, and he has expressed fondness for it in his later years. \nWhen Brown won re-election last year, he held his election night gathering at the historic residence. Gov. Jerry Brown won re-election last year to a historic fourth term. Brown and Anne Gust Brown met with reporters outside the governor's mansion. Video by David Siders. \nThe mansion has been closed to the public during the renovation, an extensive project including electrical, plumbing, fire safety and other upgrades. \nAccording to Brown’s Department of Finance, proceeds from the sale of the Carmichael mansion totaled $3.1 million. Interest increased that sum to $4.6 million before the fund was tapped to renovate the historic residence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:11:49.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
