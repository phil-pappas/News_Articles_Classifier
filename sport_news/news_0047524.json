Florida State ... more > By JOE REEDY -   \nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Florida State begins preparations for Saturday’s game against in-state rival Miami with three key starters nursing injuries. \nRunning back Dalvin Cook, who leads the Atlantic Coast Conference in rushing, is day-to-day with a strained left hamstring. The sophomore had a 94-yard touchdown run on his first carry in last Saturday’s 24-16 win over Wake Forest, then injured his hamstring on a screen pass later in the quarter. \nIf Cook is unable to play, Johnathan Vickers would get most of the carries. \nSafety Nate Andrews will be out 2-3 weeks due to a bone bruise in his left leg with Derwin James moving into the starting spot. Linebacker Terence Smith is also day-to-day with a right ankle. \nThe 12th-ranked Seminoles (4-0, 2-0 ACC) have a five-game win streak against Miami (3-1). \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:03:55.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
