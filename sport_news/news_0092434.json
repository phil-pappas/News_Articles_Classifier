They left him open almost every time up the field.” \nIsles Blackington made nine saves on 14 shots for the islanders, while Valley’s keeper, whose name was unavailable, countered with nine saves on 17 shots. \nThe Cavaliers held a 7-3 edge in corner kicks and 3-1 lead at halftime. \nWith the win, Valley advances to the quarterfinals, where it will face No. 2 Richmond (9-4). The Bobcats earned a 7-0 win over the Cavaliers on Sept. 19 in Richmond and a 4-1 victory Oct. 15 in Bingham. \nWhile disappointed with the loss, Carlsen put the team’s season in perspective. \n“I will say that living in a small community our kids work very hard [lobstering] in the offseason and rarely put the effort in playing any sport when that sport [season] is over,” he said. “These larger schools have the opportunity to play most of the year in leagues and pickup games. \n“I am very proud of my boys to make it to the seventh [seed] when they only picked up the ball at the end of August.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:25:57.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
