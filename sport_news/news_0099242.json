Morgan had two touchdowns in overtime. (Source: @RazorbackFB/Twitter) \n(RNN) â€“ Another team in playoff position came crashing down, but that's not the biggest story from this week in college football. \nOne week after getting the play of the year to date with Michigan State's fumbled punt return for a touchdown to beat Michigan, Georgia Tech blocked a field goal and ran it back for a touchdown to beat No. 9 Florida State 22-16. \nThe comparisons were imminent, but the Michigan State play still takes the top spot in my mind because they were losing at the time and scored as time expired to win. The Seminoles and Yellow Jackets were tied. But the element of turning a loss to a win was still there because the field goal would have won it for Florida State. \nIf anything makes it a bigger play, it's that it was an upset over a top 10 team by an unranked one, whereas Michigan State avoided the upset with the miracle touchdown. Either one can be considered the best play of the year depending on what you value most. \nCall them Schrodinger's touchdowns. \nThat play has overshadowed No. 3 Utah getting waxed by Southern Cal 42-24 thanks to four interceptions. The Pac 12 is the most volatile conference in college football. Just when one team emerges as good, they get spiked. \nOnly two other ranked teams lost. No. 20 California lost to UCLA on Thursday night and No. 15 Texas A&M fell to No. 24 Ole Miss in the only game between ranked teams. \nJust in case you're curious, ESPN's College GameDay had visited the James Madison campus complete with a historical re-enactment , but James Madison lost to Richmond 59-49. 1 \nHere's a look at what we learned from watching SEC games in Week 8. \n1. The SEC East is weird. Vanderbilt can win the SEC East. Let that sink in for a minute. \nWhen I was breaking down the Florida-Georgia game and its SEC championship implications last week, I neglected to mention Vanderbilt. That is largely because it is Vanderbilt. But the Commodores beat Missouri this week and have four more SEC games remaining, including one against Florida. \nThat's important because if they win out and get a little help, they could make it. That help would entail an additional loss for Florida and two for Georgia. Neither of those three things is likely to happen, but where there is hope, there is life. (Kentucky and Tennessee are still in the mix too, but both need tons of help.) \nAll of that is to say that I really want it to happen. I need this to happen. I need an undefeated LSU ranked No. 2 in the country to have to get past Vanderbilt in the SEC championship game to make the College Football Playoff. If Vanderbilt wins the conference, I will buy a T-shirt. \nSpeaking of the SEC West, it's such a convoluted mess I'm waiting at least two more weeks before even attempting to parse out a scenario for someone to win in. I need to know who wins between Alabama and LSU first. \n2. The \"Cocktail Party\" is upon us (WARNING: Statistical analysis). Florida-Georgia needs discussing again, because it's such an important game. Each team would still need at least one win (Georgia would need two, or one and another Florida loss) to clinch the SEC East, but it will be the winner's division to lose. \nNot that numbers are going to mean anything once the game kicks off, but there are some interesting ones attached to this game. If you go purely by stats, Georgia has an overwhelming advantage. The Bulldogs are better at both offense and defense and are better in the red zone. \nNeither team is particularly good at scoring in the red zone (Florida is 70th nationally and Georgia is 92nd) but Georgia is good at stopping opponents when they get close. On 19 tries, opponents have scored on the Bulldogs 14 times, 10 of which were touchdowns. That may not sound great, but it puts them 14th nationally and second in the SEC behind Vanderbilt. (More on this in a minute.) \nFlorida's offense can be explosive at times, especially in the passing game, but Georgia just so happens to be pretty good at stopping the pass. Florida is averaging 249 yards per game, while the Bulldogs allow 187. That's Florida's best matchup, because the Gators are 107th nationally and next to last in the SEC in rushing. \nBut games like this usually come down to turnovers and that's where Florida can breathe easy. Georgia's turnover margin is barely in the positive numbers, while the Gators are fifth nationally in turnover margin and sixth nationally with the fewest number of turnovers. \n3. The SEC West has its own showdown looming large. Both Florida and Georgia had a week off before their de facto SEC East semifinal and the SEC West is mirroring that pattern. \nWhile the 'Dogs and Gators face off next week, both LSU and Alabama will be resting for their matchup in two weeks following wins over Western Kentucky and Tennessee, respectively. As stated above, it's too early to get into the specifics of what it means for the SEC championship, but suffice it to say for now that both need the win, but Alabama needs it more. \nUnlike Florida-Georgia, however, this game has one thing that's going to make the difference and that's the running game. I'll probably get into more detail next week, but for now we'll leave it at this: LSU is No. 4 nationally in rushing and Alabama is No. 4 nationally at stopping the run. \nLSU is likely to be ranked in playoff position when that game comes around and Alabama could get back in playoff position with a win. \n4. Ole Miss is climbing back up the ranks. The No. 24 Rebels fell to the way side after getting handled by Florida and losing to Memphis, but came back and took care of No. 15 Texas A&M easily 23-3 even without standout defensive end Robert Nkemdiche, who is concussed. \nIt's sometimes forgotten, but Ole Miss (6-2, 3-1) only has one conference loss and, more importantly, the SEC team the Rebels lost to won't factor into any head-to-head tiebreakers. As has been their trend, Ole Miss ran the ball well against a team that is inept at defending it. \nThey needed it to stabilize a passing game that threw three interceptions. Chad Kelly was a bit uncharacteristic throwing for 241 yards and two touchdowns with three picks, but the Aggies' defense is dreadful, so it was a good time to have an off day. \nTrue to form, however, the Ole Miss defense played lights out, holding the Aggies' explosive passing game to 192 total yards and forcing 10 punts. (More on this in a minute.) \nThe Rebels' defense doesn't have a flashy ranking - seventh in the SEC - but that's not because it isn't good. The \"Landsharks\" are still 31st nationally and are at their best against the run, allowing 131 yards per game. \nThat bodes well for the Rebels because three of their last four games are against Auburn, Arkansas and LSU - teams that rely heavily on the running game. \n5. Alabama is schizophrenic. On the one hand, Alabama is a defensive behemoth with a surgical and methodical offense that can bend any defense to its will. On the other hand, they don't like playing that way. \nFollowing the Tide's 19-14 win over Tennessee, Nick Saban said they needed to \"get our tempo up\" on offense, completely ignoring that that's been the primary problem. Alabama is at its best when it runs the ball without fear or concern for what the defense will do. \nIn the first half against the Vols, Derrick Henry had nine carries 55 yards, 20 of which came on one play. The team had a total of 40 yards rushing thanks to 20 yards lost on quarterback Jacob Coker being sacked. The score tied was 7-7. Henry had 19 carries in the second half and finished with 143 yards. Coker finished the game with -26. \nSave for one quick drive, the Alabama defense was as stalwart as always and came up with a fumble recovery in the final minutes to seal the win. \nThat's the kind of paradox Alabama (7-1, 4-1) has been most of the season. They try to play around with the passing game, which has no clear go-to player, and then when it doesn't work, turn to the running game to bail it out. Start with the running game and stick with it. It's the most effective part of the offense. \n6. The Aggies are tanking. Texas A&M has come up against two good defenses in back-to-back weeks and fell flat both times. \nMeet Drew Kaser. Kaser is the SEC's best punter, but he's only fifth in the conference in yards because he hasn't been used much. That changed Saturday when Kaser was called on to punt 10 times and boomed 479 yards. That's a very respectable average of 47.9 yards, which lowered - yes, lowered - his average to 49 yards per punt. \nIf you have read this article in previous weeks, you know where this is going. \nThe Aggies' offense gained only 192 yards. As good a punter as Kaser is, he doesn't get the chance to outpunt his offense much, because the Aggies' offense is usually pretty good. But Saturday, he had 2.5 times the yardage of his offense. Wow. \nThe Rebels put up a pretty good 471 yards of offense, but Kaser topped that too. \nThe Aggies (5-2, 2-2) have had a pretty rough go of it. In the last two weeks, they've gone from being ranked in the top 10 and looking at a possible SEC championship berth to suffering two losses, being an outsider and questioning their quarterback's effectiveness. 2 \nThe good news is they only have to play one more ranked team. \n7. Vanderbilt is a defensive juggernaut. Where the heck did this come from? I had been more or less blissfully ignoring Vanderbilt because, you know, it's Vanderbilt and then all of a sudden their relevancy slapped me across the face. \nThe Commodores (3-4, 1-3) just picked up their first conference win in second-year coach Derek Mason's tenure and have a path to the SEC championship game. Wha â€¦ how â€¦ I mean â€¦ for real? Yes, for real. \nOne reason for this is their schedule has been relatively weak to this point, but Vanderbilt is pretty dang good at stopping other people from scoring. They're tied for first in the SEC (with Missouri) and third nationally (with several teams) with 10 touchdowns allowed. \nThat obviously means they're pretty good in the red zone. In fact, the Commodores have the best red zone defense in the SEC, fifth nationally and only one other power five conference team (Wisconsin) is ahead of them. \nBut it's still going to be tough the rest of the season, because their offense has no real identity and is in the bottom third of the SEC - and nation - in pretty much everything. When it comes to points, Vanderbilt is 120th nationally and next to last in the SEC with 18 points per game. \nWith Florida, Kentucky, Texas A&M and Tennessee left to play, bowl eligibility will be difficult, but don't count Vandy out. \n8. Dak Prescott needs his number retired. When Mississippi State has its senior day, Dak Prescott needs to have his jersey forever enshrined somewhere. Maybe unveil a statue or something for him, too. \nPrescott was chasing the SEC record for most passes without an interception before throwing one against Kentucky. But he still had 348 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 117 yards and three more touchdowns in the 42-16 win. \nIt's not been often that Mississippi State (6-2, 2-2) has had a player with historically good numbers, so they should do everything possible to immortalize him. He's probably not going to win the Heisman like he was hyped for starting the season, but he has the Bulldogs in position to have a say in who goes to the SEC championship game. \nWith a few bounces the right way, he could even lead them there himself. \n9. Missouri is worse than anyone ever expected. Corey Fatony has more punting yards this season than Missouri's offense. I'm calling it the Holy Grail of tracking this stat. Missouri has gained 2,211 yards and Fatony has punted for 2,411. 3 \nThis is point where in the past I would make fun of Missouri, but that's just piling on. It's like having a friend who just proposed to his longtime girlfriend only to have her dump him. All you can do is offer to take him out to dinner and give him some space to get his life back in order. \nTo give you an idea of how bad Missouri (4-4, 1-4) is on offense, let's look at their defense. \nThe Tigers' defense allows 282 yards per game. That's good enough for second in the SEC behind Alabama and 10th nationally. As said above, they're also tied for the SEC lead and third nationally for fewest touchdowns allowed. \nMissouri has four losses - all to SEC teams - and is next to last nationally in scoring offense with 14.9 points per game. \nThe complete lack of anything offensive can't be directly attributed to Maty Mauk's suspension, either. Mauk is out an unknown amount of time for an unknown reason, but Missouri's offense wasn't good with him. He was under center for a 9-6 win over Connecticut and a 21-13 loss to Kentucky. \nThe Tigers' first game without Mauk was a 24-10 win over South Carolina. Their two games with more than 300 yards were with him. \nEven if Mauk comes back before the Tigers' next game in two weeks, the season is lost. Missouri is fighting for bowl eligibility at this point, and with Mississippi State, BYU, Tennessee and Arkansas left on the slate, it's not looking good. \n10. No one wants to finish last. If you thought Auburn-Arkansas was going to be a terrible, boring game, you were right. Overtime, however, was spectacular. \nNo one was psyched about this game. 4 The Hogs scored more points in overtime than they did in regulation and won 54-46. That's 100 points, 52 of which were scored in the four overtime periods. \nThey were possibly battling for who would finish last in the SEC West. Both have difficult slates the remainder of the season with Ole Miss, LSU and Mississippi State coming up for Arkansas and Texas A&M, Georgia and Alabama on tap for Auburn. \nPeyton Barber had 120 yards and four touchdowns, three of which came in overtime for Auburn (4-3, 1-3). Cody Walker had two rushing touchdowns and Drew Morgan had two receiving touchdowns - all in overtime - for Arkansas. Two of Brandon Allen's three passing touchdowns were in overtime. \nBoth teams converted their 2-point conversion in the third overtime period. Arkansas (3-4, 2-2) came up with a touchdown on the first play of the fourth overtime and made the 2-point conversion. Auburn responded with a 1-yard run and three incompletions. \nExtra points: 1 If you are wondering about the mascot and why James Madison is called the Dukes, it's because they're stupid. The Dukes were named for school president Samuel P. Duke because he gave the basketball team towels. (No, seriously. That's exactly what the university website says.) The women's teams used to be called the Duchesses, but are now called the Dukes too, because Americans don't understand how titles of nobility work. The bulldog became the mascot because a PR guy thought it's what a British noble family would have as a pet. (Again, seriously. The university website chronicles its horrible decision making in depth.) James Madison, founder of our country and the guy the school is named for, would probably be offended by this since colonial Americans were pretty steamed at the British and swore off their titles out of spite. George Washington University's mascot is the Colonials. Washington and Lee University is the Generals. James Madison really couldn't pick something similar? \n2 What was supposed to be a battle of two of the SEC's top quarterbacks left Kyle Allen battered and replaced. Allen was 12-of-24 for 88 yards and an interception, and had an 0-for-13 stretch before being lifted for Jake Hubenak. Hubenak had only one pass attempt this season and was 6-of-11 for 46 yards. \n3 Fatony's ongoing assault on his on team's offensive numbers is incredible. He punted nine times for 429 yards while the Tigers' offense gained 188. Vanderbilt gained 304. I don't analyze every game for this, but if I ever notice a punter has more yards than both teams combined, I'm going to lose my head. \n4 That includes Arkansas fans who failed spectacularly at trying a \"stripe out,\" despite a good promo for it. Tennessee's checkerboard against Oklahoma earlier in the season was awesome. Arkansas should just be happy people were willing to pay to show up. \n\"What We Learned\" is a weekly column examining SEC football from an off-kilter perspective.
