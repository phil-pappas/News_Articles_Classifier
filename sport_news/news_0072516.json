It happens every fall, usually as October begins closing in on the first Saturday in November that marks the beginning of another Texas whitetail season. The vibrations are particularly strong this year, probably because all of the vital signs are pointing towards a great deer season. Abundant rainfall in early spring and summer resulted in optimum range conditions that provided deer with plenty of goodies to eat throughout the antler growing season. That factor, combined with good carryover of mature deer from last season, has experts in just about every geographic region of the state predicting a banner year for big racks on buck whitetails. The 2015-16 general deer season gets underway Nov. 7. If you haven’t started gathering up your gear you better get busy. Waiting until the last minute to start packing is a good way overlook something really important. Here’s a deer hunter’s checklist to help ensure that you don’t get caught in the field without something you need: 1.) Valid Hunting License: Last year’s hunting licenses expired on Aug. 31. You will need a Texas hunting license license valid for the current fiscal year to hunt legally. 2.) Hunter Education: Hunter education is required of anyone born on or after Sept 2, 1971. Hunters who complete the course receive a certification card. Keep the card in your possession while hunting so you can present it to game wardens if you happen to get checked. Hunters over 17 who have not completed the course may purchase a one time deferral for $10. If you purchase a deferral, you must be accompanied in the field by a person who is at least 17, who is licensed to hunt in Texas, who has passed hunter education or is exempt and you must be within normal voice control. 3.) Flashlight and extra batteries: Any flashlight is better than none at all when it comes to navigating in the woods after dark. Lights that are small and compact are ideal because they clip to your belt or fit in a hunting pack without taking up a lot of room. Head lamps or lights that clip to the brim of a ball cap are highly preferred by some hunters because they allow for hands-free use. Some cell phones come with decent built-in flashlights that will work if you get in a bind, but they will also eat up battery life pretty quick. 4.) Binoculars: There is no substitute for good binoculars when it comes to evaluating game. The better the quality glass used in binoculars, the better you will be able to see in low light situations. 5.) Handheld GPS: You never have to worry about getting lost in the woods with one of these, provided you mark a waypoint on your home base ahead of time. 6.) Survey tape: Survey tape works well for marking walking trails in or out. It also can be used for marking limited blood trails when trailing wounded game. 7.) Range Finder: It is particularly useful for archery hunters because it can take the guesswork out of judging the distance between you and the target. 8.) Sight It In: Just because your deer rifle shot accurately last season is no guarantee it will be dead on this year. Be sure to fire a few rounds to check the gun/scope for accuracy before you head into the woods to hunt deer. It is much better to find out a rifle is not shooting straight when firing at a paper target than a live animal. 9.) Sharp Skinning Knife: Most hunters prefer to field dress their deer before returning to camp. This means removing the deer’s entrails and leaving them in the field. One of handiest hunting knives I have ever seen is the SOG Bladelight. The knife handle is equipped with a series of LED lights that face the direction of the blade so you see where and what you are cutting in the dark. The knife also can be used as a flashlight when placed in the sheath. 10.) Rattlin’ Horns: Real or synthetic antlers clashed together on a crisp, still morning can at times bring bucks out of the woodwork. The idea is to simulate a fight between two bucks. If there is a buck within hearing distance, it will often come to check things out. Rattling doesn’t always work, but when it does it is almost like magic. 11.) Grunt Call: Grunt calls are used to simulate the low-pitched grunting noise a buck sometimes makes when he’s tending or chasing does. The sound will attract bucks as well as does, and it will sometimes put wary deer at ease. The grunt also can be used to stop a running deer in its tracks. 12.) Camera: Always take along a camera so you can document your trip. Modern cell phones are capable of taking some fairly decent snap shots so long as the proper settings are selected ahead of time. For best results set the camera on the highest resolution possible. 13.) Bug Spray: If you spend much time in the deer woods in Texas, chances are you will encounter mosquitoes, ticks or other biting insects. A good insect repellent will make things a lot more pleasant out there. 14.) Extra Keys: There is nothing more frustrating than traveling miles from home to a remote location and losing the keys to your vehicle. It can be costly, too, especially if a locksmith has to called in to get you back on the road. Carrying a spare key in a magnetic key holder can save you a lot of trouble. The holder can be placed at a hidden location somewhere on the frame of the vehicle so it is always there when you need it. 15.) Pen and Tape: In the event you kill a deer you will need to “tag” the animal with the proper tag on your hunting license, preferably before bringing it back to camp. You will need a ballpoint pen to fill out the back of the tag and tape or some other means of securing the tag to the carcass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:02:54.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
