There were no tremors, rattles or rolls shaking the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday night — just third-ranked Utah falling to USC, 42-24.\nThud.\nThe setback ended the Utes ’ reign as the lone unbeaten team left in the Pac-12 and ended an eight-game win streak that dated back to last season. They’re now 6-1 overall and 3-1 in conference play, and still in control of their own fate atop the South Division with five games remaining.\n“Obviously that’s great but I’m disappointed in how I played,” said Utah quarterback Travis Wilson. “We’ve just got to learn from this tape and then move forward and just get better next week.”\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham cited takeaways as the difference in the game. USC came up with them and the Utes didn’t.\n“Credit to them — good athletes and good players,” he said.\nUtah’s first loss of the season came on a night when Wilson was intercepted twice in the pivotal second quarter. The miscues led to a pair of USC touchdowns during a 21-point outburst that erased a 14-7 lead by the Utes.\nMiddle linebacker Cameron Smith had both of the picks for the Trojans, returning the second 54 yards for a touchdown with 1:07 left in the half. He took the initial interception back 41 yards to the Utah 4. Four plays later, Soma Vainuku scored on a 1-yard run.\nBetween the interceptions, USC pulled in front 21-14 with a 10-play, 76-yard drive. Ronald Jones II provided the go-ahead score with an 18-yard touchdown run.\nUtah never recovered and the Utes trailed the rest of the way.\nA 53-yard field goal by Andy Phillips closed the gap to 28-17 just before the half was complete, but it failed to significantly sway the momentum.\nThen, late in the third quarter, USC garnered more breathing room with a 1-yard touchdown on a keeper by quarterback Cody Kessler. Alex Wood followed with his fifth PAT to widen the Trojans lead to 35-17. It swelled to 25 points with 9:58 to go in the fourth after Kessler teamed with JuJu Smith-Schuster on a 26-yard touchdown pass.\n“It was just amazing to see the guys fight and continue to get better and band together,” said USC interim coach Clay Helton, who is now 1-1 since replacing the fired Steve Sarkisian. “It was a big victory tonight.”\nTrailing 42-17, the Utes put the final points on the board when Wilson connected with Britain Covey on a 66-yard TD toss and Phillips contributed the extra point.\nUtah wound up with 254 yards passing and 99 rushing. Running back Devontae Booker was held to 62 yards on 14 carries.\nBooker said it wasn’t USC’s defense as much as it was the Utes trying to get their passing game going. Wilson was picked off four times by game’s end.\n“The more we kept throwing interceptions the more, you know, everything with the run game stopped working,” Booker noted.\nAll in all, it was a tough night for Utah. The Utes suffered their first loss since a 42-10 decision at home to Arizona last November.\nLinebacker Gionni Paul, who finished with a game-high 17 tackles, said it was like they were punched in the mouth.\n“It was a reality check. I had forgotten what it was like to lose,” Paul explained. “It’s a bad feeling. Got to get back to work Monday.”\nSafety Tevin Carter felt the Utes came in flat and, in his opinion, got big-headed. He added that the Utes got outplayed.\n“We just weren’t on our game overall,” Covey said. “Adversity hit early and I think we kind of got out of our heads a little bit.”\nThings went Utah’s way in the opening quarter. Despite falling behind 7-0 for the first time this season — giving up a 9-yard touchdown run to Justin Davis on USC’s opening possession — the Utes retaliated just over four minutes later when they matched the TD with a 30-yard scoring strike from Wilson to Covey.\nIt was followed by three plays and a punt from USC. Covey returned the kick 40 yards to the USC 2. Bubba Poole then ran it in on first down. Phillips made the PAT to give Utah a 14-7 edge.\nAlthough the Utes were unable to hold on, Whittingham said they've still got a lot going for them.\n“The thing you can’t do is let these guys beat you twice,” he explained. “We’ve got to get over it get it out of our system and come back to work and come back ready to get a win next week.”\nThe Utes return home to face Oregon State on Saturday. Kickoff is set for 5 p.m.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com \nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:10:41.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
