Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 10:59 pm Falcons break offensive record in win over Massachusetts Aaron Parker | Sports Editor The BG News | 0 comments \nThe Bowling Green football team set a school record for offense in a win over the University of Massachusetts this past weekend. \nThe Falcons went for 725 total yards for a new program record and scored 60 points for the first time in ten years. The previous record for total offense was 706 total yards in 1978 against Grand Valley. \n“It’s an all-around team effort,” senior quarterback Matt Johnson said. “The (starters) are the ones that start it but the two’s are the ones that finish it.” \nThe offense was lead again by Johnson, who completed 33 of his 39 passes and threw for 450 yards and five touchdowns. \nWith an 84.6 percent completion rate, this was Johnson’s most efficient game of the season. It was also his fifth game passing for more than 400 yards out of six games so far this year. \nThe receivers shared the ball well over the course of the game as Johnson hit five different players in the end zone for his five touchdowns. Derek Lee, Ronnie Moore, Ryan Burbrink, Travis Greene and Roger Lewis each received the football for a score. \n“I don’t even know who scored. I can’t remember,” head coach Dino Babers said. “I’m not being funny, I can’t remember. I’m happy a lot of people got involved. I’m happy for the football team. They’re capable of doing this and they’re capable of doing it even better.” \nLewis was the country’s top receiver heading into the game and he left the same way. Lewis had eight catches for 142 yards and a single touchdown. He now has 48 total receptions, 902 total yards and seven touchdowns on the season. \nTravis Greene also had a significant impact on the ground for the team, rushing 15 times for 122 yards and a touchdown. This is the second week in a row Greene has rushed for over 100 yards. \n“We’re a good football team but we’re even better when Travis Greene is touching the ball,” Johnson said. “It’s been proven. When he touches the ball, he makes things happen. Whether it’s the pass game or the running game, when he’s in the open field I’ll put all my money on him.” \nGreene now has 3,026 yards rushing yards in his career, just the fourth player in school history to pass 3,000. \nThe Falcons will now prepare for homecoming against Akron on Saturday. The game will kickoff at 3 p.m. at Doyt Perry Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:47:38.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
