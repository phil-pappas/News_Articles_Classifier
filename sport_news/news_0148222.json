After two huge plays that nearly helped Kirksville to a road win at Boonville, the secret is out: keep an eye on No. 17 Blake Lewis. “Last week at Boonville kind of opened some people’s eyes about him,” Kirksville assistant coach Conrad Schottel said after Lewis caught two touchdown passes totaling 135 yards. “That will get some people’s attention. On our end, we’re not surprised at all and we’re excited about what he has to offer.” Lewis, just a sophomore, hasn’t only hit the big plays through the air. He’s also been seen behind the line and making big plays as a running back. Due to some injuries, Lewis has done it all for the Kirksville offense. “I’m just trying to do it for the team. We’ve got guys who are injured, who were big hits for us,” Lewis said. “They’re asking me to step up and play multiple positions and I‘m going to try my best to do it for the team and do it for the seniors.” Lewis had a long run against Salem to open up the season and that caught the attention of area coaches, but his play against Boonville really got their attention. Page 2 of 3 - For Schottel, he wants to get the ball in Lewis’ hands not just for his athleticism, but his heart. “The thing that I would say about Blake (Lewis) is from the stands and everybody watching him from the sidelines, everyone says, ‘Oh, he’s fast and pretty athletic.’ But my deal is that he’s tough and his heart is great. That’s why I want to get him the football,“ Schottel said. Before the season started, Schottel spent time to design certain plays to get Lewis the ball in space. “Anytime you’ve got an athlete like that you want to get him the ball in space. You want to get him the ball quick, so he doesn’t have to think too much. He can just get the ball and do what he does best,” Schottel said. With the opposing coaches paying special attention to where Lewis is on the field, he admits that it’s not exactly fun. “Unfortunately for me it kind of sucks because they’re eying me. Just got to be creative and try to make plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to make many this year,” Lewis said. While the big plays have been limited, it’s not from lack of trying. Page 3 of 3 - The regular season is coming to a close and Schottel is hoping that the Kirksville football program can get a few victories, while scoring a few more points. With a weapon on offense like Lewis, the potential to score on any given play is there. But Lewis is hoping that he can close out these last few games with wins not for himself, but for the seniors. “For me, it is to get a win for the seniors. No matter what happens, one win or two wins, just get one win for the seniors,” Lewis said. “Trenton is going to be a tough team, but just like most of the games this year we could have a chance to come out and win the game. It just depends on how we play. Myself, I’m going to make sure I focus and prepare in practice to do the best I can to try and get this win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:36:43.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
