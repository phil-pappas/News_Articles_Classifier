Posted: Saturday, October 24, 2015 11:45 pm \nCLARKSVILLE â€” Getting back to the top may have seemed like a journey for the Henryville volleyball team. \nSaturday's Class 2A championship against Crawford County served as the victory lap. \nThe Hornets swept up the Wolfpack in the final round, needing a little less than an hour to claim a 25-16, 25-9, 25-13 over the Wolfpack to claim the schools first volleyball title since 2010. \n\"Feels great,\" said a smiling Henryville coach Shallon Hill, whose team won it's first-ever volleyball title since moving up to Class 2A. \"We've only won three sectionals in volleyball and it has been five years since we've been able to do it, so I'm happy for the team to experience this kind of success. They've worked so hard and really put a lot of time into the season. You always like to see that work rewarded.\" \nEntering play the presumptive favorite as the lone squad in the field in the IndianaPrepVolleyball.com media rankings, Henryville beat Clarksville 25-18, 25-5, 25-17 in the morning semifinal then overcame a quick start by the Wolfpack to breeze into Tuesday's regional. \nCrawford scored five of the matches first six points to jump to a quick advantage early, but after the Hornets erased the quick deficit to eventually tie the first set at 13-13, senior Cassidy Mull reeled off six straight service points for the Hornets, who closed out the game scoring 12 of the final 15 points overall. \nThat momentum only carried over into the second set as senior Emily Hollis served seven straight points to start the set. Henryville scored 13 of the sets first 15 points to help for an easy two-set lead. \nThe third proved more of the same as Henryville capped its victory on a kill by another senior, Haley Huddleston, to seal the win. \nPait lauded her senior class of Huddleston, Hollis, Mull and Kelsey Johnson for keeping the team focused during a long layoff leading up to postseason play. \n\"We drew a bye so we had eight days of nothing but practice until our first game,\" Pait said. \"They kept us on point. They kept us focused. I couldn't be happier than I am for that senior group. This is their first tourney win in their years here so I hope they really enjoy this win.\" \nSeveral Hornets had big days, led by senior Cassidy Mull, who had 22 kills, three blocks, eight aces and 19 digs in two matches. Senior Emily Hollis finished with 27 assists in both matches and senior Kelsey Johnson led the Hornets with 40 digs. Senior Haley Huddleston also had a big all-around day with 14 kills, including a team-best 10 against Clarksville, four blocks, two aces and 18 digs. \nGearing up for the one-game regional round will be the next challenge for Henryville, who will be at Austin on Tuesday. The Hornets swept the Eagles 25-21, 25-20, 25-12 on Oct. 1 \n\"You hope you can keep going,\" Pait said. \"It'll be a challenge but I'm confident we can respond to it.\" \nCLASS 2A CLARKSVILLE SECTIONAL \nHENRYVILLE 3, CRAWFORD COUNTY 0 \nCrawford Co. 16 8 13 \nHenryville 25 25 25 \nHENRYVILLE LEADERS \nKills: Cassidy Mull 12, Courtney Brooks 6, Breanna Robertson 6, Hannah Nunn 5, Haley Huddleston 4; Blocks: Huddleston 3, Nunn 2, Robertson 1, Mull 1, Emily Hollis 1; Aces: Mull 3, Hollis 2, Huddleston 1, Nunn 1, Kelsey Johnson 1; Assists: Emily Hollis 27; Digs: Johnson 23, Hollis 9, Huddleston 9, Mull 8, Nunn 6. \nSEMIFINAL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:49:08.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
