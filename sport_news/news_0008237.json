Providence, 43-0 \nThis week: at Tallahassee Godby (2-3) \nGlance: The Conquerors thundered on last week, hammering the Stallions for their 25th consecutive district win dating back to the 2007 season.

West Nassau, 56-6 \nThis week: Columbia (4-1), 7:30 \nGlance: The Bulldogs get one of their biggest challenges of the season against the Tigers. If they win this, there’s no challenge again until Week 10 at Raines. \n3. (3) RAINES (5-0), CLASS 4A \nLast week: Off \nThis week: First Coast (1-4) \nGlance: The Vikings have lit teams up this year. Can they maintain that edge against the first formidable defense they will see this season? \n4. (4) ST. AUGUSTINE (6-0), CLASS 6A \nLast week: d. Englewood, 45-6 \nThis week: Off \nGlance: The Yellow Jackets won their 49th consecutive district game last week and reach their bye week with a very good shot at a 10-0 season. \n5.

Flagler Palm Coast, 21-7 \nThis week: Lee (3-2) \nGlance: Another good challenge for the Saints as they continue their march toward a potential unbeaten showdown with Mandarin next week. \n8. (8) OAKLEAF (5-1), CLASS 7A \nLast week : d. Fleming Island, 30-16 \nThis week: Off \nGlance: The Knights have recovered well since a loss to Gainesville Buchholz in Week 4. Offensively, they’ve looked sharp since. \n9. (9) COLUMBIA (4-1), CLASS 7A \nLast week: Off \nThis week: at Bolles (6-0), 7:30 \nGlance: The Tigers lost their last time out in a 44-41 setback to Escambia. Playing at Bolles is a brutal welcome back from the bye-week game. \n10. (10) UNION COUNTY (5-0), CLASS 1A \nLast week: Off \nThis week: Hawthorne (4-2), 7:30 \nGlance: Arguably Union County’s most difficult District 6-1A game.
