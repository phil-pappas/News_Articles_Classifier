Councilman George Segarini said he supported the proposed rate increases for water and sewer service, but chided the district for not raising them sooner. The last time similar steep increases were proposed in late 2011, the TUD Board of Directors revised the plan in response to widespread public outcry. “Shame on TUD for not getting this started a heck of a lot earlier than we are now,” he said. “I know this has come up in the past and TUD took the option of not raising rates at that time, so it’s a catch-up game at this point.” District Interim General Manager Dave Andres gave a presentation to the council summing up the reasons for the proposed increases, saying that TUD is barely keeping up with operating costs alone and forgoing much-needed upgrades to water and sewer infrastructure due to a lack of money. The district has identified $70 million worth of projects needed to repair or replace the aging infrastructure. Andres said the proposed rate increases would help to cover about $20 million of the backlog, including about $15 million that Andres said would directly benefit the system in Sonora. Raising the rates would also allow TUD to qualify for more state and federal grant and low-interest loan programs. The district currently isn’t eligible for many opportunities because it charges less than 1.5 percent of the area’s median income, Andres said. “We’re not raising the rates just to qualify for grants, but this really leverages money in rural communities,” Andres said. Despite his support, Segarini acknowledged that the increases would hurt some more than others. “I think this is definitely going to be a hard hit for our folks who are on fixed incomes,” he said. “This isn’t a small increase for them.” Under the proposed five-year rate plan, an average customer currently paying about $45 per month for water would be paying about $60 in 2016 and about $81.50 by 2020. Sewer rates would also go up from about $35 to $40 per month in 2016, with a roughly $3 increase to the monthly rate each year after that through 2020. Mayor Ron Stearn said he found it unfair that TUD charges the same rates for sewer service per household regardless of the number of people. Andres said the district can’t depend on charging based off usage because of the relatively small customer base. The district serves roughly 6,000 residential and commercial sewer customers, as well as about 14,000 water customers. “That base rate that we charge covers most of our fixed costs,” he said. “Some of the bigger utilities can afford to just charge based on usage, but because of the size of our customer base we really need to collect money from every household.” Compared to other regional sewer districts — including those in Calaveras County, Amador County and Groveland — TUD’s proposed rates would still be far lower by 2020 because the sewer system is more centralized than the other areas, Andres said. The district’s proposed water rates, conversely, would be much higher than other water purveyors in the region because TUD’s water system is far more decentralized, requiring 15 treatment plants that operate 24 hours per day. Councilman Bill Canning, who publicly blasted similar rate increases proposed by TUD four years ago, challenged Andres to guarantee that the money collected from the rate increases would all go toward system repairs and improvements. Andres responded that about $2.8 million per year of the additional $4.2 million per year generated by the increased water rates would go toward improving the district’s water system, while about $1.1 million per year would be invested in sewer projects. “Part of the rate increase will go to employee costs — including retirement and benefits — operation and maintenance costs, equipment costs… but the board is committed to putting up the numbers we talked about,” he said. Canning said after the meeting that he wasn’t convinced and planned to file a written protest against the hikes. Under state law, a service district cannot implement a proposed rate increase if more than 50 percent of customers protest against it. A mailer was sent to customers Sept. 30 with instructions on how to file a protest. “Will it hurt me? No,” Canning said, “but I’m standing up there for all of the people it will hurt.” Also at Monday’s meeting, the council: • approved a temporary closure of Green between Church streets and the city’s Coffill parking lot from 5 to 10 p.m., Oct. 23 and 24, for the grand opening of the Bourbon Barrel restaurant. • set a planning retreat for Nov. 23 to give city staff direction on prioritizing future projects.
