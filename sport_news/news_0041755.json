The born and bred DC beauty retailer is adding fifth store to the area on P Street with a grand opening celebration on Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015. Bluemercury will also be introducing a new makeup line, Lune+Aster. The 48 product line was developed by company CEO Marla Malcolm Beck and was designed to help women get ready and out the door in five minutes.\nLune+Aster products are made with quality ingredients like Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Licorice Extract and Seabuckthorn. The formulations are also paraben free, phthalate free and never tested on animals. The line includes primers, BB Creams, bronzer, highlighters, mascara and lip gloss. The Swipe + Go glosses are made with vitamins C and E and have kitschy names like “Angel Investor,” “Rebel” and “Soccer Mom”. Lune+Aster is available online and in Bluemercury stores.\nYou can sample Lune+Aster at the new Bluemercury store, located at 1427 P Street, N.W. in Washington, DC. The grand opening is Saturday, Oct. 10 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and will include free makeovers, mini treatments and cupcakes. The first 100 guests will receive a special gift bag filled with beauty treats.\nThe P Street location is the fifth DC store for Bluemercury . Earlier this year the company was acquired by Macy’s with plans to add Bluemercury stores and products to Macy’s locations in the near future. Select Bluemercury locations also offer spa services like facials, waxing and massage.", "external_links": ["http://www.luneandaster.com/", "http://www.bluemercury.com/"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:15:54.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
