Ah, yes, you may know him by his nom de guerre , Ragnar the Viking, long-time quasi-mascot for the Minnesota Vikings, who on September 20 missed his first home game since 1994 in the wake of a contract dispute with the team. His deal expired in the offseason, and though he was making $1,500 per game in his former deal, it seems Ragnar, according to the Associated Press , thought he was worth more--a lot more. His figure? The munificent sum of $20,000 per game for the next 10 years, or a total of $2 million, including exhibition games! Is this frightening Visigoth out of his mind? What even qualifies him for this role? As best as I can tell, it's because he has a beard like that Germanic tribesman who led a quixotic charge against Maximus (Russell Crowe) and the rest of the Roman Army at the beginning of \"Gladiator,\" he sports the skin of a dozen sheep around his shoulders, he has the lung capacity to blow into that horn of plenty repeatedly during games, and he rides a motorcycle out on the field--in other words, not that special. Where could the franchise ever find someone with those unique attributes? Somehow, this clown was deluded into believing he was bargaining from a position of strength, making these outrageous contract demands. The Vikings, to their everlasting credit, told him to go pound sand and refused to be extorted. The team could get almost anyone to do this job for a fraction of the price! They could go to just about any corner in the Twin Cities and enlist a homeless man--he'd do it for a hot dog, a beer, and the ability to sleep in the stands after the game ends. They could go into any bar around the stadium and enlist some tipper off a stool to perform these duties. There’s been no word, yet, on what he’ll do now that he’s unemployed, but I’d love to see his resume. What other job fits his qualifications? As he told ESPN.com Saturday, “Where am I really going to go? To a high school known as the Vikings?\" Page 2 of 2 - Well, I’m here to help with five suggestions for your next job, Joe. 1. Lumberjack. You already have the look down, you’ve got an ax, and there are plenty of trees in northern Minnesota. 2. Oilman. I’m sure you’ve heard there’s quite an oil boom right now in North Dakota. That’s led to an outbreak of crime, turning those areas into the old Wild West, but, Joe, you’re an intimidating presence, I’m sure you’ll be fine. 3. Bounty hunter. You could be the next “Dog the Bounty Hunter,” even parlaying it into your own reality TV show! 4. Personal security detail. No one is going to want to challenge you as muscle. 5. Park ranger. You seem like an outdoorsman. As ill-conceived as Juranitch’s power play was, it’s only the silver medalist for someone connected to the NFL drastically overestimating his own value; that dishonor still belongs to erstwhile Buffalo Bills head coach Doug Marrone. Marrone, you see, had a contract option at the end of last season, which he decided to exercise, ostensibly to procure a better job. Now, a promotion from an NFL head coaching job is hard to imagine; the NFL is the highest level of football--America’s most popular sport, by far--the NFL has become a secular religion in this country, and there are only 32 of those jobs. Mind you, Marrone didn’t exactly distinguish himself as a candidate with his uninspiring 15-17 record as Buffalo’s head coach, either. Marrone’s gambit failed to land him a “better” head coaching job; in fact, he failed to land any head job, or even a coordinator job--he’s now an offensive line coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars, a moribund franchise with an apathetic fan base that plays in one the league’s most charmless cities. In Chutes and Ladders terminology, Marrone took the longest slide from the top to the bottom. Marrone’s precipitous tumble is like a Hollywood director who passes on all the scripts currently being offered him--holding out for better opportunities--and instead ends up directing community theater productions in Paducah, Ky. Maybe Ragnar can go be the assistant offensive line coach in Jacksonville, and he and Marrone can commiserate about how they considered themselves irreplaceable, only to have their respective organizations tell them to take a long walk off a short pier. They should’ve listened to Beyonce years ago when she sang, “I can have another you by tomorrow//So don't you ever for a second get to thinking// You're irreplaceable.” Ryan Anderson can be reached at randerson@stjamesnews.com and followed on Twitter @randerson_ryan By Ryan Anderson   Ryan Anderson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T23:54:18.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
