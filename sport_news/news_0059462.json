Travis Hamonic watched with envy as the Blackhawks paraded around with the Stanley Cup one last time Wednesday night, raising their 2015 championship banner at the end of a lengthy ceremony before their season-opening loss to the Rangers. The Islanders defenseman saw his friend Jonathan Toews enjoy his third such celebration ahead of the Isles' season-opener against Chicago Friday in their new home at Barclays Center, the start of a home-and-home against the defending champs.\n\"It makes you jealous,\" Hamonic said Thursday at the team's practice facility in Syosset. \"You want to play. You want to win. You don't want to watch - I haven't won it, so I can't say that I watched someone else raise something that I have because I haven't had the luxury of doing that yet. But certainly jealous watching them go through that.\"\nAs the Islanders prepare for life in Brooklyn, there's a clear sense of optimism that with essentially the same team they had last season - their first 100-point campaign since 1983-84, which ended with a Game 7 loss in the first round to the Capitals - that success is on the horizon.\nRELATED: ISLANDERS IN BROOKLYN: FIVE STORYLINES TO WATCH THIS SEASON\nNo team in the NHL has been more successful in recent years than the Blackhawks, who have won three of the last six Stanley Cups, so in a sense, there's no better way for the Islanders to start the season.\n\"You couldn't ask for a tougher team to play against,\" head coach Jack Capuano said.\n\"You always talk about wanting to play the best and get a test,\" Hamonic added. \"Well, you don't get 'em once, you get 'em twice off the start. It's a good way to test yourself. It's a good barometer right away. i think we're excited about the challenge.\"\nWhat seems like less of a challenge is adjusting to traveling to Brooklyn instead of a quick car ride to the Coliseum. Capuano says the team has its game-day routine down, which for players involves taking the Long Island Rail Road to Atlantic Terminal.\n HERE.\nIt's all part of what captain John Tavares admitted was the dawning of a new era for the Islanders.\n\"It probably is,\" he said. \"I think it's a big change for a lot of people - over 40 years, Nassau County, going to the Coliseum. Now it's a much different route and way of life to get to games, and for us to, to experience what it was like. There's no more tailgating driving in and seeing all the fans getting ready and cheering us on as we're driving in. Things like that will be a lot different and unique, but we'll be riding with a lot of them in the morning to work, so it's a different change but we're looking forward to it.\"\n***\nGoalie Jaroslav Halak (upper body) hasn't been ruled out for the opener, but it's unlikely he'll play as he's taking a \"big picture\" approach. \"I'm working on it,\" he said. \"Hopefully I'll be ready soon.\" Thomas Greiss would start Friday if Halak is out.\nRelated Stories Editorial: Feeling puckish Tags: chicago blackhawks , jack capuano , travis hamonic", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:57:54.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
