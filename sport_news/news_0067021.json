Before last season, they could at least always look to the Royals as a franchise that had suffered deeper and longer. Then the Royals snuck into the post-season with a wild-card spot and won an epic rollercoaster against the Athletics before improbably steamrolling their way to the World Series until they hit a wall named Madison Bumgarner.\n“Like Superman meeting his kryptonite,” Jazayerli jokes.\nThough there may not be any love lost between the two fan-bases at the moment — given their clubs represent the only obstacle to the other’s World Series berth — Jays and Royals fans should, in theory, be able to bond over their long-suffering fandom and drought-busting jubilation.\nBut despite the Royals being reigning American League champions in their second straight playoffs, there is a case to be made — unpopular in Toronto, to be sure — that Royals’ fans deserve to win this series more than Jay fans.\nFor one, Kansas City has a longer championship drought — 30 years to the Jays’ 22 — and while Jays fans may have endured two decades of mediocrity, they never suffered the soul-crushing, wandering-in-the-darkness despair of the Royals, who lost 100 games four times in a five-year stretch and went nearly 20 years with just one 80-win season.\nThat kind of consistent failure doesn’t just test one’s fandom, it taunts it.\n“We sucked for so long,” says Danny Dryer, 33, wearing a “Party like it’s 1985” Royals’ t-shirt while tail-gating outside Kauffman Stadium before Game 6. “At least the Jays have been in the mix every now and then.”\nIt’s true the Jays were never nearly as bad as the Royals, but it should also be pointed out they finished higher than third just once during their 22-year drought.\nBut Dryer also pointed to the dismal record of the Kansas City Chiefs, the only other major pro sports team in town. The Chiefs’ only Super Bowl victory came back in 1969 and they haven’t been back since. Dryer said the Royals’ return to the World Series is important for civic morale.\n“The only thing we’ve got going for us is barbecue and the Royals.”\nThere is also the matter of the Royals coming within a game — within 90 feet, really, with Alex Gordon getting to third with two outs in the bottom of the ninth in Game 7 — of winning the World Series last season. They have “unfinished business,” Jazayerli said.\n“The way last year ended, coming so close to a championship, and instead that championship going to a team that had already won two championships in the last five years,” he said, referring to the San Francisco Giants. “If they don’t finish it off this year there will always be this sense of letting the big one get away.”\nMore on thestar.com\nEarly labour threw Jays reliever for a Loup\nAll eyes on Blue Jays, Royals as Game 6 of ALCS kicks off", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:16:54.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
