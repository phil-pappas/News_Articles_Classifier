Jonny Gomes who the Royals traded for this summer will remain on the bench as an inspirational cheerleader.\nGore hadn't been caught stealing in the big leagues until Monday's game against the Astros, and that took a controversial official review.\nThe umpires are Tony Randazzo, Laz Diaz, John Hirschbeck, who is the crew chief, Hunter Wendelstedt, Dan Iassogna, Jeff Nelson and Jim Reynolds.\nDiaz was attacked by a fan when the Royals played the White Sox in Chicago in 2003.\nThe national anthem was performed by saxophonist Michael Phillips. He has performed on a previous Opening Day for the Royals.\nThe Canadian anthem was performed by Tina Maddigan-Mayer, a Canadian who has performed on Broadway in the Wedding Singer and Mamma Mia.\nWe want to send your photos.
