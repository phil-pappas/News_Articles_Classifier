It is not everyday that a coach tells his team to treat a midseason game against a 2-4 team like it is their Super Bowl. That is Dodge City head coach Gary Thomas’s message to his team on the eve of their game against Iowa Central. Anyone who picks up a Dodge City football media guide and flips to the back or has followed the program can see why. Winning seasons have been few and far between for Dodge City. In Thomas’ first season as Conqs’ head coach in 2013, he led his new team to their first winning season since 2005. If the Conqs top Iowa Central on Saturday, they will have their second winning season in three years. That has not happened since the mid 1980s. Iowa Central presents a unique challenge to the Conqs this Saturday. With the top two Iowa schools will getting to play in a bowl games, the 2-4 Tritons still have a lot on the line every week. Iowa Central enters Saturday’s game fresh off of a 13-12 win over Highland. Dodge City lost last year’s matchup 31-21. Thomas is using last year’s game as a reminder to his team about what can happen if the Conqs do not take care of the football. \"On paper it’s not even a contest but last year we turned the ball over seven times,\" Thomas said. \"We’ve only scored 14 and 17 points in the last two weeks. So that doesn’t necessarily makes us any better than them. It’s going to come down to execution on our part.\" Dodge City averaged over 38 points per game prior to their last two games. \"We’ve played very poorly the last two weeks on offense,\" Thomas said. \"Over the past couple of years we’ve been very good at playing offense and we were good through five games. The last two weeks we’ve just been sloppy.\" The Conqs will be without three starters this week. Freshman safety Quandreko Statham, freshman defensive end Shaquille Heriveaux, and sophomore wide receiver Christian Booker have all been ruled out for Saturday’s game. \"It changes the complexion of us a little bit,\" Thomas said. \"Not necessarily in a bad way but depth wise, it’s a bit scary.\" Kickoff is scheduled for 12 p.m. at Memorial Stadium.
