I feel we believe in each other so we think we can win this week.\"\nWatching the Spartans thrive recently, rolling over U-M by a combined 64-17 score the past two years on their way to consecutive top 5 finishes, is the Wolverines' burden.\n\"Yeah, it's frustrating losing to them but you've got to get over it, you've got to go game by game and can't really think about the past,\" Smith said.\nSpeaking before the MSU game on Saturday night, the Wolverines all offered respect to the Spartans but chose their words carefully.\n■ Jabrill Peppers: \"They're a good team, but we're just trying to enjoy this win and when we come in tomorrow we'll watch the film and start the game plan process.\"\n■ Jourdan Lewis: \"We haven't seen film on them yet. They're a good team, they're a great team actually but we'll just enjoy this win.\"\n■ Harbaugh: \"Tremendous opponent, going to demand we're at our very best, that's going to mean a great week of preparation and practices in store for us. Move on more quickly than usual because it is such a good worthy opponent next week. And we'll be looking forward to it.\"\nHarbaugh expects his team won't be overwhelmed by the hype or the rivalry.\n\"Every week's a test, win the next game, it's always a big task,\" Harbaugh said. \"I think they'll do good.\"\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
