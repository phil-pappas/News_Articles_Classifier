Gahanna averages 32.8 points and allows 9.8; Lancaster averages 30.3 and allows 11.3. \nIn the past four games, Gahanna has allowed just 18 points. \n“Our defense is playing outstanding. We’re especially happy with that aspect of our game,” Lions coach Bruce Ward said. “In Lancaster, though, we’re going to run into a tough challenge. They run the kind of offense (a wing-T) that you see and prepare for only once a year. Staying true to our gap responsibility is vital for us. They’re very disciplined in what they do.” \nGahanna is seeking its first league title since 2001, when it shared with Pickerington. Lancaster last gained a share of the title in 2007. \n The home team has won the past five games in this series. Best of the rest Upper Arlington (5-1, 2-1) at Hilliard Davidson (5-1, 3-0) \nDavidson’s defense, which has not allowed a touchdown since week two, will collide with an Upper Arlington offense averaging 37.8 points. The Wildcats have won six straight in the series, which they lead 14-5. New Albany (4-2, 3-0) at Olentangy (5-1, 3-0) \nOlentangy better not look ahead to its week eight OCC Capital game at unbeaten Worthington Kilbourne. High-powered New Albany, led by running back Victor White (1,043 yards, 13 touchdowns) is averaging 40 points a game. Eastmoor Academy (4-2, 3-0) at Marion-Franklin (3-3, 2-1) \nThis might be the last chance for Marion-Franklin to preserve its impressive string of 11 straight City League South titles and 11 straight playoff appearances. The Red Devils also have won 11 straight against the Warriors. Westerville South (3-3, 2-1) at Hilliard Darby (6-0, 3-0) \nAlthough Darby has won all four meetings in the series, this game could be a trap for the Panthers. South has won three of its past four under first-year coach Kyle Stout. Central Crossing (3-3, 1-2) at Dublin Coffman (4-2, 2-1) \nThis is an important game for Central Crossing if it hopes to return to the playoffs. Its closing three games won’t offer many computer points. Coffman, 19th in the region, still has time to rebound with four tough opponents left. Westland (4-2, 2-1) at Olentangy Liberty (5-1, 2-1) \nWestland hasn’t won this many games since 2006, but securing a .500 season remains a challenge with a tough OCC Central schedule remaining. Liberty scuffled to a 7-0 victory over Marysville a week ago. West Jefferson (2-4, 1-1) at Grandview (5-1, 2-1), 7 p.m. \nGrandview shouldn’t expect a cakewalk in this Mid-State League Ohio game. In the past two weeks, West Jefferson whipped Columbus Academy (which handed Grandview its only loss) and gave Bexley (5-1) all it could handle in a 42-35 loss. Logan Elm (5-1, 3-0) at Circleville (4-2, 1-2), 7 p.m. \nLogan Elm has won six of the past seven meetings in this Pickaway County rivalry. The game holds added importance since the Braves and Tigers are eighth and 10th, respectively, in their region. Beechcroft (4-1) at Watterson (3-3), 7 p.m. \nThe outcome could loom large in both teams’ Division III playoff fortunes. Tenth in its region, Beechcroft faces just one remaining winning team. Watterson (12th) has a tougher closing schedule. \nsblackledge@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:08:18.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
