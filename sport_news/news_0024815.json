Boldin — a Super Bowl star for the Ravens against San Francisco following the 2012 season — had a late 51-yard catch that set up Quinton Patton’s 21-yard reception for the first touchdown of his career. \nFlacco’s desperation pass to the end zone on the final play went incomplete to Steve Smith, and the quarterback wound up 33 of 53 for 343 yards. Smith dropped two balls in the end zone before catching one. \nNot only did the Ravens fail to pounce on Jarryd Hayne’s fumbled punt return, kicker Justin Tucker shanked a 45-yard field goal off the right upright after he awkwardly slipped on the turf. \nKaepernick went 16 of 27 for 340 yards, and Boldin made five catches for 102 yards. Torrey Smith had three receptions for 96 yards. \nThe rematch of the Super Bowl three seasons ago featured a pair of last-place teams trying to turn around their seasons, and it showed in some sloppy play. \nSteve Smith caught a 34-yard TD pass in the third, but the Ravens (1-5) are reeling through the worst start in franchise history. Tough weekend for the Harbaugh brothers after Baltimore coach John Harbaugh’s little brother Jim’s Michigan team lost Saturday to Michigan State on a botched punt. \nThe 49ers won for the first time since Sept. 14 against Minnesota. \nNow San Francisco must prepare in a hurry for a short week with rival Seattle coming to town Thursday night. The Seahawks have won five of the last six meetings, including the playoffs. \nKaepernick is sensing a shift. \n“We’re a 2-4 football team that needs to get some more wins,” he said. “Our team is building where we’re gradually picking up momentum.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:46:12.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
