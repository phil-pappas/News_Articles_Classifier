Howe rushed for 148 yards, caught a pass for an 87-yard score and scored four times before he and the rest of the Christians went to the locker room for the halftime break. \nUniversity Christian (6-1, 3-0) coasted from there, building their 35-point halftime lead to a final tally of 61-18 in a game that was played with a running clock throughout the second half. \nWith the victory, University Christian wrapped up a fourth consecutive district title and gave them plenty of momentum on the way to a matchup against national power Brentwood Academy next Friday in Brentwood, Tenn. \n“Yeah, I’m satisfied,” University Christian coach David Penland III said Friday. “We came out fast on offense, the guys kept their head throughout and they played real hard. Hussein is our workhorse; we lean on him a lot. He’s a good leader and has a good O-line to work behind. He’s a heck of a defensive player, too.” \nIt’s a good thing there was a running clock in the second half as University Christian might have topped the century mark if the clock had stopped more often. Three times, they scored on the first play after taking over possession in the first quarter. \nThere was one sequence in which UC scored three touchdowns in the span of 26 seconds. After Howe’s first score, UC recovered a pooch kickoff return and on the first play, Clay Boyd teamed with Cameron Page from 35 yards out for a touchdown. \nUC got the ball right back when Cedar Christian (5-2, 1-1) fumbled another pooch kickoff. On the first play, Otis Anderson gained 40 yards on a counter for the Christians’ third touchdown in 26 seconds. It all happened in the first seven minutes of the game, and the game was over for all intents and purposes. \nThe three quick scores set the tone for the first half and Howe added the final straw that deflated the visitors. The Christians scored on a 72-yard pass play as the half ended, but it was called back because of a penalty, one of 23 infractions assessed in the first half. \nPushed back to their own 13-yard line, UC coaches decided to let Howe loose one final time, calling for a screen pass to the senior running back. He broke away from two defenders at the line of scrimmage and juked the last defender around the 30 before diving into the end zone for the score. \n“I turned to the left and there was nobody there,” said Howe, who has a city-leading 21 touchdowns this season. “Once I got to midfield, I knew no one was going to catch me. There was one guy still between me and the end zone, but I knew he wasn’t going to catch me. \n“This was a great win for us, especially because we got another district title. I’m confident we have all the pieces to make a great run in the state playoffs and get to the championship game.” \nHowe, who will take an official visit to the University of Utah on Saturday, finished with 175 yards on 14 carries along with his 87-yard reception. \nAnderson contributed 136 yards on six carries, including a 91-yard burst late in the game. \nThat helped the Christians roll up 495 yards of offense against a Cedar Creek defense that came into the game with one of the city’s best overall defensive averages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:43:12.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
