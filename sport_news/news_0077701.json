Baylor leads the nation with a 64-point scoring average. Tech is third nationally at 53.8 points per game, but showed little ability to slow TCU in last week's 55-52 loss.\nThe Red Raiders will win if . . .\nBring into the momentum, rather than hangover, from last week's 55-52 loss to No. 3 TCU. Texas Tech proved in that game that it can more than compete against a top five team. Losing on a tipped pass with 23 seconds left, though, can't be easy to shake off.\nHOW THEY MATCH UP\nWhen Baylor runs (edge Baylor)\nThe Bears lead the nation with a 379.7-yard per game rushing average. Three Baylor RBs rank among the Big 12s top 10 in per-game rushing average: Shock Linwood (1st, 121.0), Terence Williams (5th, 101.7), Johnny Jefferson (8th, 78.3). Tech ranks 122nd in the nation in rushing defense and 10th in the Big 12.\nWhen Baylor passes (edge Baylor)\nSeth Russell leads FBS QBs in passing efficiency (218.9), touchdown passes (15) and yards per completion (19.90). Junior WR and Richardson Pearce product Corey Coleman leads the nation in touchdown catches (8) and is second in receiving yards per game (153.3). Tech ranks 115th in the nation in passing yards allowed.\nWhen Texas Tech runs (edge Baylor)\nTech is 48th in the nation in rushing offense. DeAndre Washington has rushed for 130 yards or more in three of his last five games, including career highs of 188 yards and four TDs against TCU last week. But last year against Baylor he had just 65 yards rushing in 15 attempts. Baylor opponents average 156.7 yards rushing per game.\nWhen Texas Tech passes (edge Tech)\nIn last year's 48-46 loss to Baylor, Patrick Mahomes set a Big 12 freshman record with 598 yards on 30 of 56 passing. He also had six touchdown passes. In 8 starts at Tech, Mahomes has 2,849 passing yards, 25 touchdowns and only 5 interceptions. Baylor is allowing 161.7 yards passing per game, but hasn't faced a team of Tech's caliber. Sorry, SMU.\nSpecial teams (edge Tech)\nTech All-Big 12 punter Taylor Symmank leads the league with a 49.1-yards per punt average. The only reason he doesn't rank nationally is he doesn't have enough attempts. Tech is only 78th nationally in kickoff return defense and 71st in punt return defense, but Baylor is allowing 25.8 yards on kickoff returns.\nIntangibles (edge Baylor)\nThe Bears well remember the scare Tech put into them last year. In fact, the closeness of the game perhaps cost Baylor before the final CFP committee vote. Last week's TCU-Tech result also no doubt raised Baylor's guard for this week.\nPrediction\nBaylor 65, Texas Tech 56: That's right, 121 combined points. Good thing it's an afternoon start because this track meet will last 5 hours.\nFOUR DOWNS KEYS TO THE GAME\nHow is Mahomes' left ankle?\nPatrick Mahomes came away from last week's loss to TCU with a sore ankle. Though he practiced all week, he was listed as day-to-day. He'll need to be 100-percent with the likes of Baylor's 6-9, 280-pound Shawn Oakman chasing him.\nThird-down conversions\nTech is 6th in the nation in third-down conversion percentage, but is 120th in third-down conversion percentage defense. Clearly the Raiders need to convert against Baylor and make some key stops, too.\nBucking history\nTexas Tech is 7-20 against top five teams since 1996, including losses to No. 5 Baylor in 2013 and to No. 5 Baylor last season. Under Kliff Kingsbury, Tech is 0-4 against top ten teams.\nCan Baylor step up?\nBaylor has proven little, beating SMU, Lamar and Rice by a combined 123 points. Sometimes a step up in competition can be a shock to the system, especially early in the game.\nOn Twitter:\n @townbrad", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/townbrad"], "published": "2015-10-03T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:01:17.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
