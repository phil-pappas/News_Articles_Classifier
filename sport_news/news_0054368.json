The city has been ravaged by war and divided between government forces in the west and rebels in the east since shortly after fighting there began in mid-2012.\nThe situation is largely reversed in the surrounding countryside and the frontlines have been static for months.\nBut last Friday, government forces began a new offensive south of the city, attacking areas near the strategic Aleppo-Damascus highway.\nThe Observatory said Tuesday that regime forces had seized five villages in the area since the offensive began.\nBut Syria's Al-Watan daily, which is close to the regime, said the army had taken 16 villages and an area totalling some 100 square kilometres (40 square miles).\nIt said the operation would \"cut militant reinforcement routes between south Aleppo province and east Idlib province and take the international highway from Aleppo to Hama.\"\nThe highway that runs from Aleppo to Damascus via Hama and Homs provinces appears to be the main target of several of the government offensives launched in recent weeks.\nIn Hama, much of the fighting has centred on an area close to the road, and in Homs, the government has been fighting to take villages along the highway just north of the provincial capital.\nThere has also been heavy fighting for the Sahl al-Ghab region between Hama, Idlib and Latakia provinces, with government troops seeking to prevent rebels who control Idlib province from being able to attack Latakia.\nRussia insists its air campaign is intended to target ISIS group and others it describes as \"terrorists\".\nBut rebels and their backers accuse Moscow of seeking to prop up Assad, a longtime ally, and accuse Russia of striking moderate and Islamist opposition forces rather than just jihadists.\nThe Observatory said Tuesday that some 243 opposition forces had been killed in Russian air strikes since September 30, including 52 from IS.\nAt least 127 civilians have been killed in the strikes, including 36 children and 34 women, it said.\nAnother 25 fighters from the pro-government National Defence Forces militia were killed in clashes in Jabal Al-Akrad and Sahl al-Ghab on Monday, the monitor said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:19:09.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
