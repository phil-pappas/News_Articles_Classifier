Jean isn’t the type of opponent Crawford’s fans want him to fight, though. \nThey want the WBO junior welterweight champion to get a shot at Manny Pacquiao. That’s the type of high-profile fight, and the seven-figure payday, Crawford deserves after establishing himself as a cerebral, diverse star capable of outboxing and knocking out opponents. Pacquiao isn’t expected to return to the ring until the spring, but at 36 probably won’t fight much longer. \nCrawford, 28, knows now is the time to make that fight. Whether Pacquiao (57-6-2, 38 KOs) would want that tough of a fight in what would be the Filipino superstar’s first bout in approximately a year remains to be seen. \n\"That’s something they’re going to have to decide,\" Crawford said. \"Our teams are going to have to talk to each other and figure it out, if that’s the fight they really want.\" \nCrawford definitely wants it. \n\"It’d mean a lot,\" Crawford said. \"It’d take my career to the next level.\" \nMontreal’s Jean (29-1, 20 KOs) can take his career to the next level by knocking off Crawford (26-0, 18 KOs), a 14-1 favorite as their HBO main event nears. \n\"He’s real tough,\" Crawford said. \"He’s a puncher. He can box, bang. It’s going to make for a good fight. … He’s coming to my hometown to take my title.\" \nHOPKINS’ TAKE: Bernard Hopkins represents David Lemieux as a partner in Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy Promotions, but that didn’t stop him from criticizing Lemieux’s approach during his eighth-round technical knockout loss to dominant middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin on Saturday night at the Garden. \nMontreal’s Lemieux (34-3, 31 KOs) didn’t win a round on any of the three judges’ score cards before Kazakhstan’s Golovkin (34-0, 31 KOs) finished him. \nHe wasn’t capable of making any of the necessary adjustments to make the fight competitive, either. \n\"Guys like [Golovkin], you don’t let get off,\" said Hopkins, the legendary former light heavyweight and middleweight champion from Philadelphia. \"You hold him and you let the referee do his job. They try to fight him off them. He wants you to do that because you’ll leave yourself open. I know how to frustrate the hell out of a guy, where they’ll pick me up and try to slam me down to the ground. They don’t get in guys’ head like I’d do. \n\"You’ve got to disarm guys like that and stink the fight out, until you see an opportunity. The worst thing you can do with guys like [Golovkin] is get hurt and try to fight your way out of it.\" \nHBO will replay the Golovkin-Lemieux match at 9:30 p.m. Saturday, just before its live telecast of the Crawford-Jean fight. \nGOLOVKIN LUCKY: As impressive as Golovkin looked against Lemieux, he is fortunate Lemieux wasn’t badly hurt by the right hand Golovkin landed after Lemieux took a knee in the fifth round. \nIt didn’t appear malicious and Golovkin doesn’t have a history of fouling opponents, but referee Steve Willis would’ve had little choice but to disqualify Golovkin if Lemieux would’ve been unable to continue after that infraction. \nTwitter: @Idecboxing © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:58:44.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
