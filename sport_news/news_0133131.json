(Lindsey Wasson/The Seattle Times) The Huskies will try to contain Oregon’s running-back tandem of Royce Freeman and Taj Griffin — the best combo in the Pac-12, UW coach Chris Petersen said. Freeman rushed for 169 yards and four touchdowns in Oregon’s 45-20 victory over UW last season. Seattle Times staff reporter \nThe question seemed to both amuse and confuse Pete Kwiatkowski. \n“How does this Oregon team look? It seems like they’re maybe not as dangerous offensively as they have been in the past,” a reporter asked the Washington Huskies’ second-year defensive coordinator Tuesday. \nKwiatkowski cocked his head and smiled. \n“Who have you been watching?” he shot back. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nKwiatkowski, in similar fashion to which the Ducks have run through (and around) defenses for much of the past decade, then quickly gave a statistical tutorial: The Ducks, he said, his voice rising, are averaging more than 300 yards rushing (this is dangerously true) and more than 200 yards passing (also true, but only dangerous in a should-I-drink-this-expired-milk? sort of way) and scoring more than 40 points a game (41.5 to be exact, which, yeah, dangerous enough). \n“We’d better have our ‘A’ game, and we’d better have a good preparation,” Kwiatkowski added, “because that’s a really good offense is coming into Husky Stadium.” \nThe Ducks (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12) are not bringing Marcus Mariota with them to Husky Stadium for Saturday’s 7:30 p.m. kickoff (ESPN2), and that has many believing the Huskies (3-2, 1-1) finally might have a chance to slow the Ducks’ offense. \nWith Mariota, Oregon averaged 47.3 points per game vs. UW the past three years, all lopsided victories for the Ducks. Mariota, the 2014 Heisman Trophy winner, is starting in the NFL now, and his successor at Oregon … well, actually, there have been three of them in six games this season, and the Ducks already have lost three games, including Saturday’s double-overtime defeat to visiting Washington State. \nThe Huskies say their plan won’t change if former Eastern Washington quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. is recovered enough from a broken finger to play for Oregon on Saturday. \n“He’s only one piece of the puzzle,” Kwiatkowski said. \nMore pertinent for the Huskies is trying to contain Oregon’s running-back tandem of Royce Freeman and Taj Griffin — the best combo in the Pac-12, UW coach Chris Petersen said — and keep pace with that infamous Oregon tempo. Freeman rushed for 169 yards and four touchdowns in Oregon’s 45-20 victory over UW last season. \n“I look at that game and get frustrated and just want to be able to put up a better fight,” UW senior linebacker Travis Feeney said. “We definitely didn’t fight in that one, I felt like, and we’ve got to turn that around.” \nFeeney was asked what he remembers about the first time he played against that Oregon offense. \n“It was fast,” he said. “I was definitely out of breath right off the bat.” \nThat pace isn’t unique to Oregon anymore, with most of the Pac-12 running some form of an uptempo offense. \n“It’s not like a different changeup now going from USC to Oregon, because they’re the same quick-paced offense,” Feeney said. “That helps out a lot.” \nCertainly, it helps the Huskies’ confidence that they were able to hold USC to one touchdown in their 17-12 upset of USC on Thursday. The Trojans entered the game averaging 46.8 points, and this will be the third consecutive week UW plays an offense that ranks either first or second in the Pac-12 in scoring. \nThe Huskies continue to lead the Pac-12 in scoring defense (15.0 points), rushing defense (121.6 yards) and total defense (326.0). Kwiatkowski isn’t satisfied. He wants his defense to be even more dangerous. \n“We are playing at a high level as far as our energy output and running to the ball and being physical. I think that’s awesome,” he said. “But there’s never been a perfect football game as far as executing, and I think there’s a lot of room to get better for these guys. We haven’t arrived. It’s been five games. … But that’s all behind us, and it’s on to the next one.” Adam Jude: 206-464-2364 or ajude@seattletimes.com .
