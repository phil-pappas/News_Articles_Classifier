Related Content NHL roundup: Lightning stop winless... \nShawn Elliott, co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, will be the interim coach. \nSpurrier, 70, told his team Monday night that he was retiring, a surprising move six games into the 2015 season, albeit a disappointing one off to a 2-4 start. It's the first losing season for Spurrier since 1987. \nSouth Carolina is 0-4 in Southeastern Conference play. \nSpurrier is in his 11th season with the Gamecocks after returning to college football following a stint as a head coach in the NFL. \nSpurrier built South Carolina into a national power, and the Gamecocks had three consecutive 11-win seasons from 2011 to 2013. \nSpurrier won the 1996 national championship and six SEC championships during his 12-year stint at Florida. \nHe left Florida to coach the Washington Redskins but went 12-20 in two seasons before taking the job at South Carolina. \nSpurrier was an outstanding college quarterback, winning the Heisman Trophy in 1966 while at Florida. \nHe played nine seasons in the NFL. \nSpurrier made a name for himself as a head coach when he turned around the program at Duke. After going 5-6 in Spurrier's first year, the Blue Devils went 7-3-1 in his second season and 8-4 in his third season in 1989. \nThat enabled him to land the job at his alma mater.
