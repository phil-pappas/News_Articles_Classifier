But let’s examine this a bit closer. When the Republicans claim Lincoln, they are also implying that he was a conservative just like they are, but nothing could be further from the truth. Abraham Lincoln was a progressive. He had long been a Whig Party member, a progressive party of the time and became a republican after the Whig Party pretty much self-destructed over the slavery issue. After the war, Republicans started to split, one faction progressive and the other conservative, depending on how far you stood up with big business. In 1912 Teddy Roosevelt broke away from the Republican Party and joins the Progressive Party, this pretty much splits the Republicans, and the party starts becoming more conservative.\nIn the early 1940’s Franklin Roosevelt adopts most of the Progressive Party platform into the Democratic Party solidifying their progressive stance and the Republican Party becomes more conservative. And finally when Lyndon Johnson made civil rights part of the Democratic Party platform, the Republican Party lost all of its black vote and their remaining progressives, and the democrats lost their white support in the south. Which brings us to today, Republicans the party of conservatives and Democrats the party of progressives.\nSo if you think for a moment that freeing the slaves was a conservative idea and belief, you are sadly mistaken. Just like Women’s suffrage was a progressive ideology, and the Civil Rights Bill. Today’s progressive movement involves equal rights for the LBGT community and their right to marry, and for equal pay for women who do the same work as men and health insurance that all can afford. So perhaps we shouldn’t label ourselves as Democrats or Republicans, because maybe peer pressure is pushing you into one group or the other, and maybe not the ideology you really identify with. Maybe we should ask ourselves, am I a progressive or a conservative? Not whether I am a Democrat or a Republican. We must ask ourselves ‘What do I stand for?”\nLetter Mark Timerman\nBastrop", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/09/8a/b7/letters-300x220.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:00:20.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
