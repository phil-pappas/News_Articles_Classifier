I am sure he will be hurting inside to not get a wicket. \n\"The two weeks that he's spent here in preparation he's been bowling absolutely brilliantly. \n\"(I am) hoping that when he gets to bowl the next time, he will produce a spell that will change the match.\" \nEngland were made to toil as Shoaib Malik scored 245 in what were expected to be testing conditions for their seam-based attack. \n\"Bowling in itself, out here in these conditions in the heat, is hard and then just standing in the field watching the overs tick by and watching the runs pass by is very hard,\" added Stokes. \n\" All of our bowlers, seamers and spinners, have worked very hard and I think as a bowling unit we're very proud of what we've done. \n\"Adil Rashid was quite unlucky not to get a wicket. On another day he could have got three or four.\" \nStokes believes Rashid and fellow spinner Moeen Ali, who also finished the Pakistan first innings wicketless, can have a major say later on. \n\" I'm sure they're going to have a bigger part to play throughout this whole series so the wickets will come.\" \nEngland finished the second day on 56 without loss, with captain Alastair Cook on 39 and Moeen on 15, and Stokes expects a tough time in the middle if England are to avoid defeat in the Test. \n\" They've shown their intent with what they're going to do, they've brought the spin on quite early. \n\"We've had two weeks preparation, we've had a lot of spin bowling in the nets. It's just about playing the good balls and hitting the bad balls but spin's going to be the big challenge out here.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:04:26.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
