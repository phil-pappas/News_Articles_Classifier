If you’re not already in line outside Memorial Coliseum, you will have to go through Ticketmaster.com. There will be a limit of four tickets per person and online orders will come with a small service charge. \nGood luck, everyone. The majority of you will strike out, but I’m pulling for you. \nGo Cats. Article written by Drew Franklin I can recite every line from Forrest Gump, blindfolded.
