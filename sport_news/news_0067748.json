(Marianne Helm/Getty Images/AFP) Article \n\nHere comes another heavy game. \nThe Winnipeg Jets (4-1) and St. Louis Blues (4-1) are set to get together for the first time this season and it figures to be a physical affair. \nAlthough the Jets are among the NHL leaders in goals for, a tight-checking contest is expected. \n“Both teams can score, but both teams can grind, too,” said Jets head coach Paul Maurice. “We'll see how the game happens. It's going to be a balance for us. We wanted to keep our defence as good as it was last year and be better than 17th offensively. We're kind of on path to that. Again, I'm still really resisting the urge to draw any conclusions about who we are after five games. \n“We are trying to make more plays. Our goal production, like everybody's, is going to slide here in a little bit, when you get back onto our side, in the Western Conference and in the Central Division, it's just going to be tighter.” \nOndrej Pavelec is expected to start in goal for the Jets, while Brian Elliott gets the nod for the Blues. \n“We know they're going to be a good team,” said Jets centre Mark Scheifele, who has three goals in five games this season. “They've got a lot of skill and play a hard, defensive game. We know it's going to be a tough test for us. We've got to stay with our game.” \nJets winger Blake Wheeler talked about some of the keys to his team's hot start. \n“With the style that we play, we're able to dictate the tempo a little bit when we're playing well. That's helped us get some games in our favour,” said Wheeler, who is riding a five-game point streak and leads the Jets with seven points in five games. “We're starting to get our offensive game where we want it. Creating as much havoc at the net as we can. We're moving a lot in the offensive zone, controlling the puck and then getting a high volume of shots to the net. \n“It makes it tough to defend us because we have guys who can move well, guys who are big and strong on the puck and we're making the defencemen turn and look for loose pucks in front of the net.” \nAnthony Peluso made his season debut for the Jets, replacing Nic Petan. \nThe Blues will be without centre Paul Stastny, who suffered a lower-body injury after blocking a shot in Friday's game against the Vancouver Canucks. \nThat opens the door for Winnipegger Ryan Reaves to return to the Blues lineup after sitting out as a healthy scratch on Friday. \nAlong with Reaves and fellow Winnipegger Alex Steen, Brandon product Joel Edmundson rounds out the Manitoba contingent on the Blues roster. \nEdmundson, who was chosen in the second round (46th overall) in 2011, has no points and five penalty minutes in four games this season as a rookie defenceman. \nHere's how I expect both teams to start on Sunday: \nJETS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:40:30.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
