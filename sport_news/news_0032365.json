If it determines it wants to proceed with expansion, word could come when the league meets Dec. 7 and 8 in Pebble Beach, Calif. On Sept. 29 in New York, the executive committee heard a one-hour presentation by Foley and a similar expansion proposal by a group looking to return the NHL to Quebec City.\n\"I would expect we'll hear something to happen in December and whether we can move forward,\" Foley said.\nIn the meantime, Foley is trying to secure land to build a practice facility for the team. He said Black Knight Sports has a request for a proposal with Clark County for a site, but would not disclose the location. If the request is approved, Foley hopes to begin construction on the facility in June.\nFoley also said two more suites have been sold at the new $375 million, 17,500-seat MGM-AEG arena under construction, and that the total amount of tickets sold is slightly above the 13,500 figure consistently cited in the media.\n\"What's amazing is that I think we've had 10 people ask for their money back,\" Foley said. \"I'm so impressed by the loyalty of the Las Vegas fans and the faith they have in us.\"\nHe also said he's already receiving resumes from people who want to be part of his hockey organization.\n\"We're probably getting five to 10 resumes every day,\" Foley said. \"But we're not doing anything yet with those.\"\nContact reporter Steve Carp at scarp@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2913.
