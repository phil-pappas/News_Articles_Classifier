It's all the intensity you'd expect from the rivalry, just on the ice. \nASU head coach Greg Powers said in a statement he knows how special this rivalry is, even with is team elevating their status, \"We will always respect the rivalry between the two Universities, and we're not going into this just because they're not an NCAA team any other way. We're going into this with what we think is our very best team this Saturday.\" \nMatchup fun facts: Saturday will be the first NCAA hockey game played in the state of Arizona since 1985, when Northern Arizona had a NCAA team. There are eight Sun Devils that have NCAA-level playing experience. ASU head coach Greg Powers is 39-1 all-time against Arizona. Jordan Young, Liam Norris and Garrett Peterson will all take the ice as ASU captains for the first time this Saturday. \nHockey fans would be doing themselves a disservice if they skipped out on attending Saturday night's game. \nIt'll be intense. \nIt'll be gritty, hard-hitting hockey. \nBragging right are on the line. \nPuck drops at Gila River Arena at 7 p.m. Read or Share this story: http://12ne.ws/1L8SwTR TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:29:17.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
