The brawl is believed to have started as an argument between religious and secular Jews, which quickly deteriorated into a violent free-for-all.\nThe police officer said he was detaining one of the brawlers, the victim ran at them with a knife and attempted to stab the detainee. The officer fired at the suspected attacker, critically wounding him. The man was rushed to Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, but succumbed to his wounds.\nAnother man was seriously wounded.\nA team from the Justice Ministry's department for the investigation of police officers was called to the scene and subsequently decided to open a formal investigation.\nYaniv Kubovich\nHaaretz Correspondent\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/yanivkub", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "https://www.facebook.com/yaniv.kubovich?ref=ts&fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:42:41.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
