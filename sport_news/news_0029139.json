Baker got a lot of the snaps along the defensive line that might have gone to other players. Nobody on the unit played more than Baker did. (Toni L. Sandys/ The Washington Post) \nThe Redskins fell to the New York Jets, 34-20, on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. Here’s how the 63 offensive and 67 defensive snaps were divided up: \nQuarterback Kirk Cousins – 63 snaps (played 100 percent on offense) Colt McCoy – DNP Robert Griffin III – DNP \nWell, where do we begin? Cousins had another two-interception performance and, for the fourth time this year, it resulted in a Redskins loss. He was far from accurate, noticeably throwing behind receivers again. Redskins coach Jay Gruden said he intends to continue starting Cousins. If these performances persist, it’s hard to believe that he will finish the season under center. \nOh, and Griffin was active for the first time this season. The Redskins didn’t have any healthy scratches because of all the injuries on the active roster. Running back Chris Thompson takes a toss from Kirk Cousins against the Jets. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nRunning back Chris Thompson – 37 snaps (59 percent) Alfred Morris – 26 snaps (41 percent) Darrel Young – four snaps (six percent) \nThe running game was nonexistent for a second straight game. Washington didn’t have rookie Matt Jones, who was ruled out with a toe injury, but it couldn’t establish the principal identity offensively with Alfred Morris and Chris Thompson. They combined for 33 yards on 16 carries for a measly two yards per carry. Without a productive run game and pass attack, the Redskins’ offense didn’t sustain possessions and produce scoring drives on its own. All 13 points scored by the offense occurred after a defensive takeaway. \nWide receiver Pierre Garcon – 52 snaps (83 percent) Jamison Crowder – 51 snaps (81 percent) Andre Roberts – 32 snaps (51 percent) Ryan Grant – 30 snaps (48 percent) Rashad Ross – 10 snaps (16 percent) \nA week after Grant slipped and fell on the game-losing interception return against the Atlanta Falcons, he had a noticeable dip in snaps. He played 80 percent of the game against the Falcons, along with Crowder. Against the Jets, it was Roberts, who was a healthy scratch two weeks ago versus the Philadelphia Eagles, who played half the game. Grant finished with two catches for 22 yards on four targets, while Roberts had one reception for six yards on four targets. \nTight end Derek Carrier – 58 snaps (92 percent) Anthony McCoy – 14 snaps (22 percent) \nJordan Reed missed his second consecutive game because of a concussion. Carrier finished with four catches for 39 yards, while McCoy again was rarely used. Lacking depth at the position, the Redskins can’t rely on two-tight-end formations as often as they would with a healthy Reed. \nOffensive line Ty Nsekhe – 63 snaps (100 percent) Spencer Long – 63 snaps (100 percent) Josh LeRibeus – 63 snaps (100 percent) Brandon Scherff – 63 snaps (100 percent) Morgan Moses – 63 snaps (100 percent) Tom Compton – one snap (two percent) Arie Kouandjio – DNP \nFor all the injuries the Redskins have suffered this season, there have been moments where backups have stepped in and played surprisingly well, given the circumstances. Against a tough pass rush, that was the case for center Josh LeRibeus and left tackle Ty Nsekhe. With Trent Williams and Kory Litchensteiger ruled out, the Redskins’ offensive line was solid in pass protection. It couldn’t provide any holes in the run game, however, which was a issue even last week when Williams and Litchensteiger were in the lineup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:51:19.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
