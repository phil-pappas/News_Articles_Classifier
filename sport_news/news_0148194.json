He was probably destined for a slaughterhouse, but will instead be headed to a cozy home east of Denver.\nThe Weld County Sheriff’s Office couldn’t find the 3-year-old pig’s owner, so the boar was given to Hog Haven Farm owner and director Erin Brinkley-Burgardt.\nBrinkley-Burgardt says she primarily cares for pot-bellied pigs, which people buy as pets but often abandon as they grow larger. The veterinarian who treated Lucky says he appears to be a Yorkshire pig.\nBrinkley-Burgardt says Lucky can expect to live about 13 years in captivity.\n___\nInformation from: Daily Times-Call, http://timescall.com/", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1hsk5eM", "http://timescall.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:26:24.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
