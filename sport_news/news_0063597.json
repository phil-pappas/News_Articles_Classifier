And good football teams do that. But a little close.\" \nThe Spartans also are hoping to get better in the training room before they head to Ann Arbor to face No. 18-ranked Michigan (5-1, 2-0) for a 3:30 p.m. game next Saturday. \nMSU lost starting tailback Madre London to an apparent right leg injury. Offensive lineman Jack Allen was knocked out of the action when he took a helmet to the knee in the final minutes. \nTight end Josiah Price (ankle) and left tackle Jack Conklin (knee) were held out of the Rutgers game, but both were available under \"emergency\" conditions, according to an MSU spokesman. \nThe Spartans finished the game at Rutgers missing nine players that began fall camp projected as starters. \nSpartans quarterback Connor Cook -- who was 23-of-38 passing for a season-high 357 yards, two touchdowns and an interception at the end of the first half -- said he's not concerned with the injuries. \n\"I'm not concerned at all. Guys are going to get healthy next week,\" Cook said. \"We've got some guys that should get back. Josiah (Price) should be back, Jack Conklin should be back. \n\"I don't know what's up with Jack Allen but he'll probably end up playing, too. But like I said before, if you're really concerned about stuff like that, then you shouldn't be out there playing. We have so many other guys on this team, and they might not have the experience, but they're waiting on their opportunity to step in there and shine.\" \nThe MSU players who were starters at the start of fall camp who weren't on the field for the final snaps on offense or defense against Rutgers were: \n• OLB Ed Davis (knee)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:23:54.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
