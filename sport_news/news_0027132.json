(AP Photo/John Locher) \nLAS VEGAS (AP) — The daily fantasy sports industry has gone to great lengths to distance itself from traditional sports wagering, and the CEO of the ubiquitous DraftKings website made no effort to get cozy as he sat in front of a crowd of casino executives at a casino trade show last week. \nThe legal stance by Jason Robins of DraftKings that daily fantasy sports leagues are not a chance-based gamble has done nothing to tamp down what has become an intensifying national debate around the country. \nMany in the highly regulated casino industry insist daily fantasy sports leagues are gambling sites and shouldn’t be treated any differently than traditional sports betting. Others suggest the sites could be a potential haven for money-laundering. \nThe debate was a hot topic of conversation at the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas last week.
