Or at least, the team’s media guide seems to have been purged of any reference to the actual nickname of the squad Philly is playing this week. \nThis information arrived Wednesday via a tweet by Matt Lombardo, a reporter for NJ Advance Media who has been covering the Eagles for various outlets since 2010. In other words, he seems like someone who would probably notice something unusual about an Eagles media guide. This is interesting. The #Eagles appear to have wiped the name #Redskins from this week's weekly media guide. #NFL pic.twitter.com/VgA9ksVrbi \n— Matt Lombardo (@MattLombardo975) September 30, 2015 \nCertainly, the photo of the covers seems telling. Previous media guides this season have touted “Eagles vs. Falcons” and “Eagles vs. Jets,” but this week’s version reads, “Philadelphia vs. Washington.” \nLombardo also tweeted out a photo of the Game Notes page, which lists copious information about the all-time series, as well as connections between the two teams. Nowhere does the word “Redskins” appear. The word “Washington” appears about 20 times. \nThere are several instances where that makes perfect sense, such as saying a game was played “at Washington.” But combined with the cover, the lack of the word “Redskins” anywhere is eyebrow-raising, to say the least. \nIn addition, at Chip Kelly’s news conference Wednesday, the coach never used the word “Redskins” during 12 minutes of questions and answers. Here is a sampling of his comments about his upcoming opponent: “[Cody Parkey] has been down at Washington’s stadium, he’s been in our stadium…” [When asked about the Redskins’ offense with and without DeSean Jackson:] “I think that offense has changed different than what it was last year. … They’re a little more run-oriented this year because of their backs … They threw the ball a little bit differently in both games we played them last year.” “I’m just concerned with Washington. I don’t care if we score two points and win 2-0, or if we score 52 points and win 52-51. We’re concerned with beating Washington.” \nAsked another question about the difference between Joe Barry’s defensive scheme and that of Jim Haslett, Kelly’s lengthy answer used the word “they” over a dozen times, plus a “Washington.” For what it’s worth, Kelly referred to “the Atlanta game,” but he also mentioned the “Jets.” \nIt’s possible that there’s nothing here except happenstance. But the Eagles’ media guide cover indicates a different story, one that would be noteworthy to Reds… er, Washington fans.

He previously had used 'Desmond Bieler' as his byline, but feels that shortening the first name to 'Des' nicely conveys his ever-decreasing gravitas. He also covers Fantasy Football. sports Success!
