Puck will drop at 4:00 p.m. eastern. \nEntering the season, UMass Lowell was selected at No. 4 in the Hockey East preseason coaches poll and sits at No. 14 in the USCHO.com preseason poll. \nThis year A.J. White and Michael Kapla will lead the River Hawks as the team’s captains . Joseph Gambardella and Adam Chapie will serve as the team’s alternate captains. Head coach Norm Bazin returns to the bench for his fifth season season along with his assistants Cam Ellsworth and newly hired Andy Jones . \nNew Brunswick had an excellent season last year and held their own in net with a 2.12 goals-against average over 28 games. However, both their goaltenders Chris Carrozzi and David Shantz have moved on from UNB and the team has welcomed two new faces to their roster. \nThe goal of an exhibition game to start the season is to get everyone on the same page and to see what lines work well together in competition. \n“There are specific emphasis points; to work out the kinks, to get game timing, to see some of the combinations work together, but more importantly than anything is to work on our game,” said Bazin. “We like to keep it simple, we give them strict parameters on the defensive side of things but allow them a lot of flexibility and creativity offensively.” \nAs it has been for the past few seasons, UMass Lowell will take on a Canadian college in an exhibition game to get things underway in Lowell. New Brunswick is this year’s team. \nBe sure to follow our Live Blog on Sunday afternoon and tune into our MCS Live Faceoff: College hockey season preview show on Saturday, Oct. 3 at 12:00 p.m. eastern.
