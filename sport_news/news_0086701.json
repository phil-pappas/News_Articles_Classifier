Ellsworth (7-0-1, 57.9082 points) is first in the 18-team region. The top 12 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nThursday's outcome is not reflected in the Heal Points, thus, the Mustangs are 2-8 and the Lions 0-9. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.
