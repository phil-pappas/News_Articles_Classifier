Colorado was in my top two.\"\nDespite the Buffaloes winding up in second place, the Florida big man said he liked Oregon State throughout the process and was impressed with the coaching staff.\n\"I liked the coaching staff,\" Bassett explained. \"I just thought going to Florida was my best opportunity.\"\nAfter his visit to Corvallis, the power forward was high on the Beavers, but in the end it wasn't enough.\n\"They showed me the campus a lot. I met all of the staff, academic advisors. Everyone seemed to be on the same page. I liked that,\" he told The Oregonian . \"They all have the same goals and try to reach them. I liked the environment around campus, the support for the community ‚Äì everything. Oregon State was nice.\"\nOregon State's basketball class is currently ranked No. 42 in the country by 247Sports ‚Äì three spots ahead of Florida ‚Äì but the Beavers intend to more than double the numbers of commitments by signing day.\nWhile Oregon State missed on Bassett, it's clear the program is ready to compete with the nation's top programs on the recruiting trail.\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec", "http://247sports.com/Season/2016-Basketball/CompositeTeamRankings", "https://twitter.com/dontezzy_bo/status/653702191459532800", "http://247sports.com/Player/Dontay-Bassett-77072"], "published": "2015-10-13T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:10:50.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
