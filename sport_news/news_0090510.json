Ft. Lauderdale / Florida / U.S.A. – WEBWIRE – Tuesday, October 20, 2015 \nIt was a really exciting few days. This was a free event and the turnout was incredible. Even the Red Bull Air Force made an appearance, with two wingsuit stuntmen landing right next to the temporary stadium. We decided to donate our Body Glove Boards to the winners, because we fully support the beach bum lifestyle at Divers Direct!

Each of the four tournament champions received an exclusive Body Glove stand up paddleboard for their achievements. \nSwatch Beach Volleyball World Tour FINALS The finals took place right on Fort Lauderdale beachfront at the beginning of October 2015, where a temporary stadium and structure was built in order for the City of Fort Lauderdale to host the event. Prior to the finalists arriving in Fort Lauderdale, tournaments have taken place in Croatia, Norway, and Switzerland. The finalists were recorded saying that they loved Fort Lauderdale as a location because they were able to play beach volleyball on a real beach, and take a cooling swim in the water after their match, none of the previous locations had such luxuries to offer! \nDivers Direct Travel and Events Manager Lindsey Fundine says: The energy in the air was contagious. The stadium built against our gorgeous beaches and palm trees provided both players and fans an atmosphere to remember. The Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau did a fantastic job of showcasing just why we love living and working here its paradise! \nBody Glove Stand Up Paddle Boards Winners! Brazil dominated the finals on Sunday, and took home Gold and Bronze in both the mens and womens matches. In the womens Gold match Brazils Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca took first place (beating Germanys Laura Ludwig and Kira Walkenhorst). The winners took home $100K, and each won a 10 Body Glove Venture SUP from Divers Direct. \nBrazil also dominated overall in the mens matches, with Alison Cerutti and Bruno Schmidt taking Gold, $100K and a Body Glove Venture SUP board each. USA took Silver with Floridas own Nick Lucena and Olympic Gold Medalist Phil Dalhausser putting up a fight. Brazil also took the mens Bronze match. \nGearUp Expert Elisa Buller was at the event: It was a really exciting few days. This was a free event and the turnout was incredible.
