AP Photo/Richard Shiro × Of course, it’s early. Bumbling Georgia Tech is more than capable of upsetting No. 6 Clemson on Saturday at Death Valley. But college football playoff elimination scoreboard watching is fun while it lasts if Tiger fans have enough stamina and Tums after last week’s 24-22 victory over Notre Dame. The rest of the schedule includes only one ranked opponent — No. 12 Florida State is due at Clemson on Nov. 7. Landing a spot in one of the two playoff games (Orange Bowl or Cotton Bowl) is not as simple as 1-2-3. It might be as simple as 0-1-2: Zero. If all the Power 5 conferences offer undefeated teams for College Football Playoff Selection Committee consideration, Clemson as champion of the maligned ACC is likely the odd team out. One. Clemson squeezes in if any other Power 5 conference produces a one-loss team, though a one-loss TCU-Baylor loser in the Big 12 and/or Ohio State-Michigan State loser in the Big Ten will make for a formidable challenge. Two. Clemson has no chance to make the playoff with a loss, unless the Tigers are ACC champions and all other top Power 5 representatives have two losses apiece. It’s much easier in Pigskin Picks, where five losses were good enough to beat Warren Peper (4-6) and me (3-7) last week. Week 6, and redemption: South Carolina at LSU No way this game gets moved to Baton Rouge with South Carolina 5-0 and a candidate for a playoff spot. Gene Sapakoff pick: LSU, 31-19 Warren Peper pick: LSU, 35-20 Georgia Techat Clemson Georgia Tech averaged 342 rushing yards per game last year during an 11-3 season capped by an Orange Bowl win over Mississippi State. The Yellow Jackets in losses to Notre Dame, Duke and North Carolina over the last three games averaged 215 rushing yards. Sapakoff pick: Clemson, 34-24 Peper pick: Clemson, 30-20 Wofford at The Citadel Not a great game for patrons of passing, but a double dose of triple-option makes for fine entertainment. The Bulldogs have to get running back Cam Jackson (4 carries for 22 yards vs. Charleston Southern) more involved. Sapakoff pick: Wofford, 21-20 Peper pick: The Citadel, 23-20 Monmouth at CSU Monmouth is in its second season in the Big South, but Hawks head coach Kevin Callahan has been on the job in West Long Branch, N.J., for 23 years. Sapakoff pick: CSU, 28-17 Peper pick: CSU, 27-17 Miami at Florida State Florida State running back Dalvin Cook’s hamstring injury doesn’t seem serious and quarterback Everett Golson made strides in last week’s 24-16 win at Wake Forest. Sapakoff pick: Florida State, 31-24 Peper pick: Florida State, 30-21 Arkansas at Alabama Jake Coker was almost ideally efficient at quarterback against Georgia. If he keeps it up, the Tide will roll to the playoffs. Sapakoff pick: Alabama, 24-17 Peper pick: Alabama, 36-21 Florida at Missouri Is Tigers freshman quarterback Drew Lock that good? Or did South Carolina just make him look that good? Sapakoff pick: Florida, 20-14 Peper pick: Florida, 34-31 Georgia at Tennessee Butch Jones’ Vols were outscored 56-20 after halftime in close losses to Oklahoma (31-24), Florida (28-27) and Arkansas (24-20). Georgia might be juggling quarterbacks all season. Sapakoff pick: Georgia, 27-24 Peper pick: Georgia, 28-24 Navy at Notre Dame It took Notre Dame three quarters to figure out it could find open receivers against Clemson’s blitz. DeShone Kizer will do better in the early going this week. Sapakoff pick: Notre Dame, 45-14 Peper pick: Notre Dame, 35-17 Oklahoma vs. Texas Charlie Strong is off to a terrible start at Texas, but deserves another year to try to fix the mess he inherited.
