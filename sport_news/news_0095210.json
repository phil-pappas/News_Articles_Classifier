With the Barclays Premier League just returning from their break, I thought it would be fitting to grade them on how they are getting on. \nAFC Bournemouth – C \nIt’s almost impossible to hate Bournemouth, but despite being everyone’s favourite underdogs they have failed to meet the high expectations that they have accumulated throughout their rise from the lower leagues. They currently sit 17th in the table with eight point from nine matches, which any other season would usually be a decent start, but this being the most competitive season the Premier League has seen and they fact that they lost some of their best players to long term injuries, I can’t see them surviving. \nArsenal – A \nArsenal seem to be the only team that are going to challenge Manchester City for the title this season. They may be ahead of Manchester United on just goal difference but they destroyed the Red Devils 3-0 at the Emirates. They have one of the best in-form players in the league at the moment in Sanchez and Ozil looks like a new player this season. If they keep up this kind of performances I don’t see why Arsene’s men can’t take away a trophy this season. \nAston Villa - F \nI had high hopes for Aston Villa this season. They have been floating around the relegation zone for several years and with the appointment Tim Sherwood and the amount of money they have spent this summer, I thought they would have finally be able make a push for a mid-table finish. However it’s not to me and it looks like they will be fighting for survival yet again this season. They have lost seven of their first nine games, more than any other side in the Premier League, and unless they start to get their stuff together soon I wouldn’t be surprised to see their name highlight in red at the end of the season. \nChelsea – E \nWatching Chelsea this season is like watching a completely different side compared to last season. Mourinho seems to be out of his depths for the first time in a long time and the off the field controversy has clearly affected the camp. I’m not one to single out players, luckily Mourinho has done that for me, most notably Ivanovic and Fabregas. No matter how many people Mourinho throws under the bus that he parked throughout last season, he can’t hide the fact that he is the one under pressure and Chelsea could finish outside the top four if he doesn’t take action. \nCrystal Palace – B \nCrystal Palace are definitely over achieving this season. They currently sit 6th in the league but have more losses than anyone in the top half of the table and I can’t see them keeping up their form until May. Alan Pardew has got them playing effective football that gets results but can struggle to maintain any real form for an entire season. Having said that there’s no doubt that they have made a great start to the season and that they deserve to be where they are. \nEverton – C \nEverton’s performances have improved a lot since last season, however, they still aren’t living up to their true potential. This is probably down to having a young and relative inexperienced squad, compared to recent season. They currently sit 9th in the table but I feel like they have what it take to step it up in the run up until in Christmas and can place much in the top 8 come May. \nLeicester City – A \nBy far the biggest surprise package of the year, Leicester have carried on their form from the tail end of last season and have looked good doing it. Mahrez and Vardy both made it into my Barclay’s Premier League Team of the Season and they both deserve it. I don’t expect them to keep this momentum up for the whole season but I can see them finishing in the top half of the table. \nLiverpool – C \nIt’s been a very difficult season for Liverpool. They had by far the hardest first six away matches of any team in the BPL and couldn’t compensate by having a good run at home. After drawing 1-1 in the Merseyside Derby they sacked Brendan Rodgers and brought in Jurgen Klopp. Klopp has had only one match so it’s hard to judge were they might finish this season but just going off Klopp’s reputation he should be able to lead the Reds to qualification for Europe this season. \nManchester City – A \nMan City are by far the best team in the league after the first nine matches. They seemed unstoppable until they played against Spurs. Despite being tactically outplayed at White Hart Line I think that Man City have the best team in the league and on their day could beat anyone. \nManchester United – B \nControversial but I couldn’t give Man U more than Arsenal after the 3-0 hounding they received the other week. Man U have done well against the smaller teams but haven’t made an impact against team they will be competing against for places in the table come the end of the season. The loss to Arsenal is a prime example of this, but they good make me eat my words if they pull off a good result against Man City this weekend. \nNewcastle United – F \nIt’s hard to not be too harsh on Newcastle, because they have genuinely been horrendous. Hats off to them for their 6-2 win over Norwich but I feel like it said more about Norwich than it did about Newcastle. It will still be a relegation battle for Steve McClaren and his men this season but after spending over £50 million in the summer on new players, they deserve nothing more than an F. \nNorwich City – E \nSpeaking of Norwich, they’re next up. They may have spectacularly lost to Newcastle but they deserve a better grade than them on merit. They are a newly promoted side and are currently outside of the relegation zone. I predicted them to return to the Championship on the first time of asking but so far they are proving me wrong and I feel like that deserves at least a little bit of a grade boost. \nSouthampton – C \nThis really has been a mediocre season for the Saints. They’ve showed moments of brilliance but they have also lost 3-0 to Everton and drawn four matches, a number which is only bettered by Spurs. They will more than likely finish around mid-table which is disappointing considering they have been so good at improving despite losing their best players in recent years. \nStoke City – D \nStoke have transformed from a club they spend not very much money and just managing to stay in the league every year to an established Premier League team. They finally splashed some cash this summer in a bid to make it into the top eight and it seems to have been their demise. They’ve gone backwards rather than forwards and everyone had very high hope for them this season. Come the end of the season they will probably be hovering just below the midpoint of the table. \nSunderland – F \nIt’s not looking good for teams up north this year and Sunderland are no expectation. They are rock bottom of the Premier League and are by far the worst team in the league. No shape, no skill and no hope, well maybe. They have just sacked Dick Advocaat and hired Sam Allardyce, who has never managed a team that’s been relegated from the Premier League. \nSwansea City – D \nSwansea looked like they were going to qualify for the Europa League but has fizzled out and now they look like they are destined for a mid-table finish. Gomis was brilliant at the beginning of the season, scoring four goals in four games but was given a four out of ten against Stoke on Monday and hasn’t looked the same player we all saw. \nTottenham Hotspur – C \nSpurs’ best achievement this season be far is the 4-1 win over league leaders Man City. Even though they currently sit 7th and they haven’t got the goal scoring form of last season’s Harry Kane but they have showed glimpses of excellence so far. They have also made some good transfers in the summer, most notably Son. \nWatford – D \nWatford are currently sitting 15th which is pretty good going for a newly promoted team. They sacked their manager after getting promoted and made many new signing, mostly from the Serie A, so a lack of togetherness and unfamiliarity with the league and the manager made me think that they would struggle. However thanks to five goals from Odion Ighalo so far this season they may be on course to surviving. \nWest Bromwich Albion – D \nMuch like Stoke, West Brom saw this as a season that they could use to take the next step but have gone backwards rather than forwards. They spent a lot of money too and managed to keep hold of some of their best players. Needless to say this will be yet another season of rebuilding from West rom, unless they manage to turn things around before Christmas. \nWest Ham United – A \nAnd finally West Ham. They have beaten Arsenal, Man City and Liverpool, which has to be the most impressive record so far this season. They have a few stand out players but none more so than Dimitri Payet who seems to score or assist at least once a game. They are fourth at the moment and I can’t see them placing that highly come the end of this season but I wouldn’t be surprised if they qualified for the Europa League come May.
