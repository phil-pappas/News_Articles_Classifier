I don't believe in any of that anyway. We believe in what we're building here, and that's all I worry about. I'm not a superstitious guy. When we play good, we win. When we play bad, we lose.''\nRemember Montero's wise words, Chicago, as America begins paying closer attention to the story of the 2015 Cubs in the National League Championship Series and possibly — gulp — the World Series. No matter how many times media members missing the point mention billy goats, Bartman or 1969, resist the urge to fall for the tired, lazy narrative.\nIt's not cute, not in the proper context and no longer applicable for this Cubs team. Most Cubs fans realize that after spending the past year listening to manager Joe Maddon and watching his young players joyfully live in the moment. This is about those guys, not a supposed curse cast on the Cubs before their parents were born or an NLCS game blown when they were in middle school. This is about a new winning tradition taking hold, not a lovable losers lament that blames futility on bad luck. That defeatist culture no longer exists at Clark and Addison.\nAn extraordinary Joe changed all that.\nPre-Maddon, people had every right to expect the worst from the Cubs, especially in the playoffs. Post-Maddon, the prevailing thought is the best is yet to come. Attach no relevance to anything that happened to the Cubs organization before Theo Epstein became team president in 2011. Make no connection between this Cubs team and any franchise history recorded before Nov. 3, 2014 — the day Maddon started talking playoffs at the Cubby Bear.\nGranted, that is easier said than done given the constant reminders. A GoFundMe page attempted last week to raise money to pay Bartman's way to the wild-card game in Pittsburgh. Two minutes into Wednesday's \"Outside The Lines\" program on ESPN, host Bob Ley addressed the Cubs' \"lurking dread'' and asked: \"Aisle 4, Row 8, Seat 113. … Do I have to tell you that's where Steve Bartman was sitting (Oct. 14, 2003)?'' The network already has replayed a documentary on the NLCS Game 6 foul-ball incident. Expect more reflections from more outlets once the series actually starts.\nSome people have suggested the Cubs should honor Bartman by inviting him to the ballpark — a good intention but bad idea. That's like a newly married couple showing a video of past breakups at the reception. It's not fitting for the occasion. What Bartman deserves most is the maintenance of the privacy he cherishes. Save any such goodwill gestures toward Bartman for the Cubs Convention, only if he's amenable. The Cubs owe Bartman, and the rest of their fans, everybody's full attention on winning it all.\nLeave Bartman alone, wherever he is, to enjoy the playoffs in peace. Simon the magician would be a more appropriate Cubs guest. Or bring back a pink flamingo. Ask Maddon's mom, Beanie, to throw out the first pitch. Even Eddie Vedder is a harmless prop. Keep any external images fun and current, not dated.\nAvoid thinking about the past. These Cubs, all about the future, are thriving in the present. Enjoy it. Savor it as much as they clearly are. This could mark the beginning of the golden age of Cubdom. Don't miss it dwelling on quirky Cubbie occurrences that always sounded more like excuses than explanations, on things that have no bearing on the outcome.\nIt's all about the process anyway, as Maddon likes to say. The process of working out Thursday at Wrigley as \"Quiet Riot\" and Miranda Lambert blared from the speakers. The process of winning 97 regular-season games and eliminating baseball's two best teams is all these Cubs know. The process of meeting goals develops good habits for a team with five rookies.\nTheir idea of a tortured past is a slump at Triple-A Iowa. Their memories only go back to spring training. May that be every Cubs fan's frame of reference when watching the NLCS. Don't get sucked in by incessant attempts to connect eras. The only similarity is the logo. The players remain happily oblivious and immune to talk of a heavy history.\nIf the Cubs win the pennant, it will be because of superior pitching and a potent offense that can play small ball or go deep. If they lose, it will be because of bad execution, not karma.\nThese Cubs don't care about that stuff, as Montero said.
