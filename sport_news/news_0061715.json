Everything's not a sin,\" Carrie says to her mother, after being told she can't go to the prom.\nStrengths: The kids are more than all right. Ranging from a first-time professional performer (Jake Daley as Tommy) to a young vet who toured with \"Evita\" (Malia Davis, here playing Carrie), the young cast is in strong voice, and in good step with director/choreographer Kirk Mouser's moves.\nMalia Davis plays the title role in \"Carrie, The Musical.\" Paul Fardig/Stumptown Stages The play is reset in 2012, and Evan Tait, as Billy, puts a current, emo-thug spin on the John Travolta role from the 1976 movie. He also lands some smartass ad-libs that diffuse the oh-so-serious script.\nPlaying supreme mean girl Chris, Carrie Morgan breathes malevolence and belts out sure notes.\nIt's eerie how closely Amber Mitchell, as Sue, resembles Amy Irving from the movie, and how she convincingly morphs from mean girl to human.\nDavis's Carrie is more anxious than meek — an interesting take. Under her frumpy hand-me-down layers, she's full of wincing, nervous energy, as if constant bullying has set her to permanent fight-or-flight mode.\nWeaknesses: Originally, Margaret White was terrifying. As written by King and played by Piper Laurie in the film, she was a volatile zealot who believed in modern day witches and spewed Old Testament hellfire. In this rendering, Margaret (Susan Jonsson) is defanged through four mawkish ballads. That she's no longer frightening removes a big point of conflict in Carrie's arc, and her mother's filicide, then, doesn't square up. You just don't swap out Medea with Maria von Trapp.\nComposed by Dean Pitchford and Michael Gore, who crafted pop hits and Oscar-winning movie themes in the '80s, \"Carrie's\" score should be much stronger and catchier.\n\"Carrie,\" which introduces the lead, is a syrupy-sweet number that should be haunting and foreshadowing. \"And Eve Was Weak,\" where Margaret agonizes over Carrie getting her period — \"the curse of the blood\" — is set to a booming \"Sweeney Todd\"-style arrangement. It comes off satirical and silly, like an overture to \"Change, Change, Change (Change of Life)\", the opening number from \"Menopause The Musical.\"\nAnd do these lyrics from the song \"Carrie\" sound familiar?\n\"I am a song of endless wonder/That no one will claim/But someday, oh my, someday!/ Someone will know my name!\"\nTurns out, Pitchford and Gore wrote pretty much the same lines for the chorus of \"Fame,\" their 1980 Oscar-winner for Best Song:\n\"I'm gonna make it to heaven/Light up the sky like a flame/ \"I'm gonna live forever/Baby, remember my name\"\nTake-away: Talented teens and twentysomethings take on Broadway's biggest musical bomb. They're terrific. The show's still a bloody mess. But admit it: You kind of want to go, don't you?\n— Lee Williams for The Oregonian/OregonLive\n ***\n\"Carrie, the Musical\"\n Where: Brunish Theatre, 1111 S.W.
