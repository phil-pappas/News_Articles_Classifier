There I was cutting through Central Park last fall on my way to a dinner party when I got caught in a rudely impromptu blizzard, wearing nothing but a pair of wafer-soled canvas sneakers. With the disfiguring effects of frostbite on my mind, I cursed: “If only I’d worn boots.”\nI wasn’t just wishing for any boots. I was envisioning a pair rugged enough to help me outwit the city’s deviously slippery sidewalks but handsome enough to not be a fashion faux pas at an uptown dinner.\nLuckily enough, such hybrids aren’t a figment of a menswear editor’s imagination. Of late, more brands have been tinkering with versatile boot designs that combine the durable soul of an ankle-high hiker with a look that’s cleaner, more considered and city-appropriate.\nAnyone who remembers last year’s deep freeze in the Northeast U.S. knows that such a shoe comes in handy. “Being an urban commuter in New York City is not that different than being on the trail,” said Gene Han, owner of Hatchet Outdoor Supply Co., a Brooklyn boutique that caters to cosmopolitan guys with an appreciation for the great outdoors. A well-appointed hiking boot, he added, is a far better option than, say, the running shoes that city-dwellers often rely on. Here’s a shopping guide to four options that fit the bill—from Danner’s stylishly authentic Gore-Tex trekkers to Berluti’s dressy, office-to-Alps boots.\nDanner, Mountain Light Waterbuck Boots $360, danner.com\nENLARGE Danner, Mountain Light Waterbuck Boots Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas Brought to you by: An 80-plus-year-old, Portland, Ore.-based purveyor of range-ready hikers.\nAuthenticity factor: Very high. Danner is a hiking-boot company that happens to make a stylish product. And when the predecessor to these boots were introduced in the late 1970s their waterproof yet breathable Gore-Tex lining was a groundbreaking development.\nStyle quotient: They’re not overly fashion-conscious—more of a considered take on a classic Timberland boot.\nBut can I hike in them? Absolutely. Just ask one of Danner’s many mountain-climbing fans from the Cascades to Kilimanjaro.\nComfort factor: These are tough, so be prepared to break them in a bit. Our recommendation: Use the wide ankle opening to your advantage and pair them with some chunky socks for a little more cushion while you do.\nTraction action: With closely spaced treads, the Vibram outsole isn’t very flexible, but it does form a nice, flat surface that’s ideal for stomping through a storm.\nPrecipitation protection: That aforementioned Gore-Tex liner is 100% waterproof which is perfect for battling the next blizzard.\nWeight class: Light. Or at least as light as you would want a sturdy, all-weather boot to be.\nIdeal conditions: Sleet? Cantaloupe-size hail? These boots are ready for whatever wintry concoction mother nature can cook up.\nWear ’em with: Straight-legged dark denim and a waxed-cotton field jacket. These are made for the guy who wants to lean into that rugged, Pacific Northwest look.\nDiemme, Roccia Vet Boots $370, ssense.com\nENLARGE Diemme, Roccia Vet Boots Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas Brought to you by: Brothers Dennis and Maico Signor, who have been producing mountain-worthy footwear in their northern- Italian factory for over 20 years.\nAuthenticity factor: Medium-high. The company is based in the foothills of the Italian Alps, an area long known for its outdoor footwear production, which the brothers know well. Its focus on fashion is recent.\nStyle quotient: The sharp contrast of the black suede and stark white sole lend this pair a grittier, city-specific sensibility.\nBut can I hike in them? Not quite, said creative and marketing director Karolina Hellström. “The upper is suited for hiking,” she said, but the sole, designed for city use, is too light for the trail.\nComfort factor: High. They’re lined with supple cow leather rather than traditional, tougher pigskin.\nTraction action: The contrasting white Vibram sole is chunky with zigzagging ridges to prevent slipping. In such a thick sole, you’ll never be completely agile, but at least you’ll be upright.\nPrecipitation protection: The Italian suede has been coated in a water-repellent wax, which isn’t entirely waterproof but will work quite well in the face of a few flurries.\nWeight class: Though this boot is lighter than classic hikers, all that puffy interior padding and the solid sole still add up. It’s a substantial design.\nIdeal conditions: The day after a storm, when city streets are at their slushiest. They’ll keep your feet dry, while the black shell won’t show off the city sludge. Just wipe down regularly after getting home to avoid salt stains.\nWear ’em with: Tapered sweatpants and a designer anorak to Saturday brunch.\nOff-White c/o Virgil Abloh Hiking Boots $798, a-ma-maniere.com\nENLARGE Off-White c/o Virgil Abloh Hiking Boots Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas Brought to you by: Recent darling of the designer world Virgil Abloh, known for his street-inspired styles and exacting Italian fabrications.\nAuthenticity factor: Surprisingly lofty. Think high fashion means low function? Think again. By including a formidable rubber sole and mountain-tested crampon attachment (to prevent slipping while descending an incline) Mr. Abloh made sure this boot was Andes-ready. Even if you’re just managing Minneapolis.\nStyle quotient: The effect is subtle but leather detailing around the laces and tapered toes give a more rakish than rugged look.\nBut can I hike in them? If you’re the kind of person who thinks nothing of hiking in $800 boots, go right ahead.\nComfort factor: Mr. Abloh’s taste for luxury is palpable when you step into the squishy foot bed.\nTraction action: Treads-a-plenty to keep you steady when traversing those icy sidewalks. What’s more, the rubber extends up over the dual-stitched construction to create a slush guard around the toecap.\nPrecipitation protection: Mr. Abloh wouldn’t advise submerging them entirely, but he does describe the boots as “snow-proof,” thanks to an attached leather tongue, which seals the upper.\nWeight class: Heavy, due to the sturdy sole and metal crampon.\nIdeal climate: Clear skies on a chilly day. If you’re kicking around on damp streets, the suede is bound to get a little dirty. Save these for dry days to keep them looking fresh.\nWear ’em with: Wide-wale navy cords and a solid cashmere crew neck sweater for a simple yet sharp look that will let the retro red laces really pop.\nBerluti Brunico Venezia Leather Boots $2,620, Berluti, 212-439-6400\nENLARGE Berluti Brunico Venezia Leather Boots Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas Brought to you by: The French masters of exquisite, handmade footwear, with a 120-year cobbling heritage.\nAuthenticity factor: Sticker shock aside, this boot is hardly pure indulgence. It was inspired by a custom ski boot that Berluti developed in the ’20s for Rudolph Valentino.\nStyle quotient: See the Valentino backstory above. Artistic director Alessandro Sartori kept the Italian actor’s sophisticated edge in mind when designing these boots. They “combine city style with alpine rigor,” he said. In other words: a merger of classic dress and hiking boots.\nBut can I hike in them? Yes, you can. Bonus: you’re guaranteed to be the most elegant hiker in the woods.\nComfort factor: Constructed in Berluti’s Italian workshops, this has more of a classic dress-shoe feel and as such the leather footbed will take some time to break in.\nTraction action: The sporty tread-heavy sole and thick double-seam Goodyear welt are impressively rugged for such a refined piece of footwear.\nPrecipitation protection: Low. They are not treated for rain, so if the forecast calls for a storm, it’s probably best to leave these in your closet.\nWeight class: Middle. The comparatively thin sole makes it lighter, but the added monk-strap buckle does add heft.\nIdeal climate: Chilly but unclouded. These are great for those frigid days when you have to trek from meeting to meeting in the cold. But avoid snow. You wouldn’t want to muck up that beautiful leather.\nWear ’em with: A navy wool suit or thick tweed trousers and a sweater. For added flair, wear cuffed pants that will sit nicely around the cross-foot strap.\nMore in Men’s Fashion Pleated Pants for Men: They’re Back, Guys Your Top 7 Men’s Style Questions for Fall, Answered A Studied Look: Fall Menswear’s Professorial Style Why Men Should Invest in Shearling This Fall Why You Should Be a Man in Black for Fall Do Men Really Wear Pajamas to Bed?", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV555_HIKING_8H_20151020123829.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV554_HIKING_8H_20151020123822.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV552_HIKING_16H_20151020123809.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV553_HIKING_16H_20151020123816.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/wsj/wsj-fashion/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV554_HIKING_16H_20151020123822.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV555_HIKING_16H_20151020123829.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV552_HIKING_8H_20151020123809.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV553_HIKING_8H_20151020123816.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:28:55.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
