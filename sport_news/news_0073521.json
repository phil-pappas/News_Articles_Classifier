If you're the Mets , you just tell him to start impersonating great players in other sports. \nAnd since they are in the city of the Bulls, just do what Michael Jordan did after hitting six three-pointers in the first half of an NBA Finals game against the Trail Blazers in 1992. \nLet David Wright explain what he was thinking after Murphy homered for a sixth straight game Tuesday night in the Mets' 5-2 win over the Cubs . RELATED: 5 really good reasons Mets won't blow a 3-0 lead to Chicago Cubs \n\"It's ridiculous,\" Wright said. \"We were talking in the dugout and being here in Chicago, should have given the shoulder shrug to Jordan after that last one. It's fun to watch. Being a hitter, I understand how difficult it is to do what he's doing, to continue this hot streak for ten days or whatever it's been. I mean, it's impressive doing it off these pitchers. It's fun to watch.\" \nLuckily, Murphy is able to cogently explain how he's able to do this all. \n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"I wish I could explain it; I would have done it like six years ago. I can't explain it. I can only thank Kevin Long and Pat Roessler for the work that they've put in with not only myself but with all the guys hitting. I wish I could explain it; I can't.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:08:47.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
