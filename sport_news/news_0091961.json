You got to pass the ball through the middle.\" \nBy the final whistle, the Golden Panthers (9-6) had reaped the benefits of that philosophy, jumping out to a 4-0 lead at half on the way to a 6-0 shutout victory over the Bombers (3-14). \n\"We're a similar team [to Boonton],\" Golden Panthers head coach Sean Palen said. \"Luckily for me, I have a little bit more depthâ€¦and I have a great group of seniors, really phenomenal.\" \nIt was indeed the seniors who led the way, as five of the six Golden Panthers goals were scored by members of the graduating class. \nKlimek, who tallied a goal and two assists herself, said it was about leaving everything out on the field. \n\"It's really bittersweet but it'll be your last time playing on home field so you want to go out and leave it all,\" she said. \"You don't want to have any regrets whatsoever and that's what we did tonight.\" \nAfter putting pressure on the Bombers defense from the get go, the Golden Panthers finally broke through around the 22' minute, when Aikey sent a skipping ball into the box from the left side, which Klimek got a foot too and smashed against the underside of the crossbar and into the back of the net. \nThen, around the 19' minute, the Golden Panthers added to their lead when sophomore Jenna Goodwin smashed it home with her right foot. The Golden Panthers continued to find the back of the net in the half, scoring two more goals courtesy of senior Dana Scillieri and Aikey. \nScillieri found the back of the net in the 11' minute when Klimek sent a through ball on the ground in between the Bombers back line, allowing Scillieri to calmly slot it home on her first touch. \nThe Golden Panther final goal of the half came around the sixth minute when Aikey tallied her first goal of the contest, running onto a lofted through ball and smashing it past Bombers goalkeeper Kayden Mobley. \n\"We were having fun,\" Klimek said. \"We knew we were up so the pressure was off a little bit.\" \n\"At the same time, we knew we still had to work hard but we just came out so pumped up that that's how we got four goals so quick, and then we could relax for the rest of the game and try to pass more and do all that stuff,\" she added. \nThe Golden Panthers were rewarded for their continued hard work in the second half by finding the back of the net two more times. \nThe first came around the 30' minute when Scillieri collected the ball in the box, and worked herself open for a shot that ricocheted off the right post, the back of Mobley, and across the goal line for a Golden Panthers 5-0 lead. \nThen, Klimek and Aikey teamed up for a second time around the 26' minute, this time with Klimek providing the pass and Aikey the goal, Aikey's second of the game. \n\"The senior squad is where the depth of your team comes from,\" Palen said. \"This year I had five captains for seniors and that's massive and they all contribute. There all starters on the field so it's a really great cast, good girls, and we've seen them for a few years.\" \nOn this Wednesday night it was all about acknowledging the seniors, and they certainly finished out their final regular season home game with a bang.
