Some teams don’t really have a tight end. It’s not easy for their scout teams to replicate the bulk and muscle that Stanford regularly applies.\nWhen the No. 15 Cardinal host No. 18 UCLA on Thursday night, they hope to ride that advantage to their eighth straight win in the series.\nStanford beat UCLA twice in one week in 2012, including the Pac-12 title game. The Bruins were on the brink of winning the Pac-12 South last season until they were upset by Stanford 31-10 in the season finale.\nUCLA hasn’t beaten Stanford since a 23-20 decision at the Rose Bowl in 2008, when Jim Harbaugh was in his second season as the Cardinal’s head coach.\n© Mark J.

Terrill, File) Head coach David Shaw is 5-0 against the Bruins, but says that number and Stanford’s seven straight wins in the series are irrelevant to the next game.\n“Most of the people who had a hand in those games aren’t on either team,” he said. “The big thing is: ‘Where are both teams now, and can we play our best game on Thursday night and have a chance to win?’ What happened last year or the year before doesn’t matter.”\nGuard Johnny Caspers said the team has “a slight sense of confidence” against UCLA as a result of previous successes. But he said, “What we build off more is what we’ve done this year as a unit as opposed to wins in the past.”\nA fifth straight win would make the Cardinal the only team in the Pac-12 North without a loss in a league play. Then they would have three of their last five league games at home, only one of which is against a team that’s currently ranked, No. 23 Cal.\nUCLA head coach Jim Mora is 0-4 against Stanford. His teams have allowed at least 192 yards rushing in each of those games.\nHis defense wasn’t helped by injuries to linebacker Myles Jack, defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes and cornerback Fabian Moreau. Meanwhile, the Cardinal have been clicking lately, scoring at least 41 points in their past three games.\nIn four games against UCLA, Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan has completed 65 of 88 passes for 776 yards and five touchdowns, with just one interception.\nLooking for a breakout: Even though Christian McCaffrey had kickoff returns of 67 and 31 yards in Stanford’s last game, he hasn’t broken one for a touchdown.\n“We don’t get a lot of opportunities,” special-teams coach Pete Alamar said. “People don’t like to kick the ball to him. I guess, because we haven’t run one back for a touchdown, we’re the most over-respected kickoff-return team in America.”\nIf opponents are content to kick short and let Stanford take possession near the 35-yard-line, that’s fine with Alamar. Stanford ranks last in punt returns, but Alamar thinks McCaffrey is just as capable of breaking a return there as he is on kickoffs.\nThe rest of the special teams have done well. Conrad Ukropina is 7-for-8 on field-goal tries, and Alex Robinson is fifth in the league in punting (43.0). The kickoff-coverage team, spearheaded by Craig Jones and Peter Kalambayi, ranks second in the Pac-12.\nTom FitzGerald is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Under head coach David Shaw, the Cardinal are 26-3 at home. UCLA is trying to get its season back on track after a 38-23 home loss to Arizona State.\nInjuries: UCLA — LB Myles Jack (knee), DL Eddie Vanderdoes (knee), CB Fabian Moreau (foot), S Mossie Johnson (knee) are out for the season. Stanford — OLB Kevin Anderson (undisclosed) is out.\nWhat to watch for\nIt’s Stanford’s first look at heralded freshman QB Josh Rosen, who replaced Brett Hundley and is already setting UCLA passing records. Rosen isn’t the runner Hundley was, but he has a strong arm and a quick release. Plus, Jordan Payton and Thomas Duarte are one of the best wideout combinations in the Pac-12.\nStanford uncharacteristically has just six sacks and is tied for last in the Pac-12 in that category. Meanwhile, UCLA has allowed only four sacks — second best in the league — partly because Rosen has a very quick release and is smart about throwing the ball away when he can’t find an open receiver.\nUCLA RB Paul Perkins is “Stepfan Taylor-like,” according to Stanford head coach David Shaw, who predicts he’ll have a long career in the NFL. Like Taylor, Perkins has quickness, elusiveness and the strength to break tackles. His average dipped to 115 yards per game after Arizona State held him to 63.\n— Tom FitzGerald\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:03:24.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
