(Photo by Matt Hinshaw/The Daily Courier) By Brian M. Bergner Jr. The Daily Courier PRESCOTT VALLEY - Trailing 9-5 in game four against the visiting Marauders, the Bradshaw Mountain volleyball team responded with a 10-1 point run that propelled them to a 3-1 series victory over old Grand Canyon Conference rival Mingus on Tuesday night.\"We struggled in game one ... I think it was just our execution on killing the ball that really hurt us in the first game. But after that, we dominated,\" said senior Emma Williams, who had back-to-back kills to give the Bears a 12-10 lead in game four, which led to an eventual 25-16 win to seal the deal.Williams had nine kills to go along with her nine digs Tuesday night and the confidence for the Bears, she said, is beginning to pick up.\"We had a great beginning to our season and we had a bit of a rough patch these past couple days, but this really picks up our confidence and we'll be able to go really far now,\" Williams said. \"We beat [Mingus] in their house, and our Friday football game kind of pumped us up a little bit. We wanted to dominate after our Bears lost to them on Friday night. I wasn't nervous before, so, I was excited.\"Mingus football beat the Bears 20-15 on Oct. 2.Back on the volleyball court, where Bradshaw Mountain [13-10 Overall] has won two of their last three matches, junior Katherine Brannan added 11 kills and five digs on the night.After the Bears lost game one, 25-15, due to several attack errors and other miscues, Brannan said she knew her team had to get it together quick.\"I think we realized we needed to pick it up and get our stuff together and play how we know how to play,\" said Brannan, who recorded a hitting percentage of .194 against Mingus.Bradshaw Mountain head coach Natali Washburn used the term \"frustrated\" to describe her team's effort in game one.\"I was definitely frustrated, not really nervous, because I know what my girls are capable of and I was expecting them to turn it around and stop making so many errors, and they did that,\" Washburn said.The third-year coach added that her Bradshaw Mountain squad did not perform well, and that it was mostly their own fault, but did not hesitate to give credit to a \"scrappy\" Marauders team.\"Mingus is a scrappy team, and they always play us tough. It's always a good match, but I knew it was on us. We needed to step up our game,\" said Washburn, who watched her team easily win game two 25-16 to tie the series at 1-1.In game three, Bradshaw Mountain found itself trailing again, this time by a 15-7 score before an ace by senior Joelle Bobinsky tied it at 18-18 to cap an 11-3 run.After a solo block by senior Kyre McNell and a Williams kill to make it 24-21, Mingus outside hitter Kiana Kreiner would miss-hit the ball against the out-of-bounds stick above the net to give the Bears a 25-16 win.McNell had two solo blocks and nine kills against the Mingus [2-10 Overall] while recording a .263 hitting percentage.As a team, the Bears hit only .089, one of their worst performances of the season. That can certainly not continue, Washburn said, if her team expects to stay in matches this season. Tuesday night's win, however, will help.\"Every win helps boost confidence,\" Washburn said. \"That's what we're working on, we want to keep trying to find our rhythm and keep pushing forward and find that level of intensity that we need to stay at throughout the game.\"Next up, the Bears will play host to Sedona Red Rock on Thursday, Oct. 8. The Scorpions are ranked No. 26 in Division III while Bradshaw Mountain sits at No. 38.Official start time is set for 6 p.m.Follow Brian M.
