Both are injured.\nSkipper and pacy full-back Hazem Emam is also out as he serves the second of a two-match suspension imposed after he invaded the pitch to confront Ahly's players in a heated Super Cup clash in the United Arab Emirates earlier this month.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:46:05.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
