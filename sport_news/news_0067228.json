K.C. Johnson Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Bulls offense looks fairly smooth but can coach Fred Hoiberg iron out defensive problems? \nAt the start of Bulls training camp, the Tribune posed five questions facing the team. Four weeks later, and two days before the start of the 50th season in franchise history, did the preseason provide answers? \nLike most things associated with the NBA right now, the Bulls are a work in progress. But here are the questions with updated answers after eight exhibitions. \nHow will Fred Hoiberg fare? \nPlayers continued the main themes they voiced in the offseason, consistently citing offensive freedom. And indeed, the exhibitions featured more reads and fewer play calls from a coach who consistently preaches playing with pace. \nThe defense didn't fare as well. Whether that's a reflection of Hoiberg starting a more offensive-minded lineup, the injury-marred nature of the preseason or a combination of both will be answered in part by the regular season. \nHoiberg's calm sideline demeanor stayed consistent throughout. \nWho will start? \nAt least at the outset, it will be Pau Gasol, Nikola Mirotic, Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler and Tony Snell. What happens when Mike Dunleavy returns from back surgery remains to be seen. \nAll the action from Lincoln, Neb. \nWhat's also unknown is if Hoiberg will change his starters if the first-quarter defensive struggles continue. He has hinted as much when he consistently talks about the roster's flexibility. \nIt's a philosophical change, to be sure, starting such offensive-minded players as Gasol and Mirotic and stacking defensive-first big men like Joakim Noah and Taj Gibson in the second unit. Hoiberg is fortunate Noah and Gibson are such team-first players. \nCan Rose make it through a full season without injury? \nHe didn't make it through one practice in preseason, fracturing his left orbital bone thanks to a Gibson elbow midway through the first session. \nIsn't it time for some good luck from the basketball gods? Rose, who endured three knee surgeries in three straight seasons, enjoyed his first offseason without rehabilitation and promptly fractured his face. \nHoiberg plans to keep minutes evenly distributed and use a 10-man rotation, so perhaps this finally will be Rose's time to stay healthy. \nWhat can Gasol do for an encore? \nIn his mind, the perfect way would be to win a third championship. The All-Star, who turned 35 in the offseason, is on board with his minutes going down. And it's almost certain he won't get as many isolation plays called for him as he did under Tom Thibodeau. \nBut Hoiberg consistently has mentioned Gasol's pick-and-pop shooting ability as crucial for offensive spacing and also noted how low-post presence must be utilized to vary the offensive attack. Gasol remains the man in both departments. \nIs Doug McDermott ready? \nThe former lottery pick looked like it during the preseason. He shot 37 percent from 3-point range (18 of 49), averaging 11.6 points overall. And while his defense still needs improvement, his space-the-floor shooting is crucial to create driving lanes for Rose and Butler. \nPerhaps best, McDermott said this preseason success feels different than last season's. He certainly sounds more confident he will produce when the bright lights shine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:04:11.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
