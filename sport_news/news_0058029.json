Cole, right, runs through the Hillgrove defense last season. The Hawks beat the Warriors in 2014, and Cole and his teammates will try to even the score tonight at Emory Sewell Stadium. Game: Hillgrove (3-2, 1-0) at North Cobb (2-3, 1-0), 7:30 p.m.Last year: Hillgrove 28, North Cobb 7All-time series: Hillgrove leads 3-2Prediction: Hillgrove 35, North Cobb 32Both Hillgrove and North Cobb have had some early-season adversity.The Hawks had to deal with an injury to starting quarterback Matthew Wilson and North Cobb had trouble holding on to leads in the fourth quarter, despite playing top-notch opponents.Both squads appear to be bouncing back, and in regards of Region 4 , both are where they want to be. They won their respective region openers two weeks ago, and whoever wins between the teams tonight at Emory Sewell Stadium could get a leg up in the 4 standings.“Every week in this region is tough,” North Cobb coach Shane Queen said. “Obviously, Hillgrove is in the state playoffs every year and they’ve been in the elite eight year in and year out. Obviously, this will be a huge challenge for us.”Wilson is no longer standing on the sidelines, which will be a concern for the Warriors. The Class all-state honorable mention scored four touchdowns in Hillgrove’s 40-21 win over Marietta last week, two with his arm and two with his feet. He also conjured up 215 all-purpose yards.After losing by three touchdowns to Hillgrove last season, Queen said the Warriors would have to set the tone by running the ball and making big plays. Jai Irwin and C.J. Cole have rushed for 183 and 174 yards, respectively, for the Warriors and scored a combined four touchdowns.Both running backs played pivotal roles in North Cobb’s game-winning drive in its 21-14 win over Harrison. They chewed up the last 6 minutes of clock in the fourth quarter before Irwin punched it in from 1-yard out with 21 seconds left.“We’ve got to win those games,” Queen said. “That’s what we’ve stressed the last few weeks, finishing the drill. We’ve been having great weeks of practice and hope to carry it on the field.Game: Osborne (0-4) at Kennesaw Mountain (1-3), 7:30 p.m.Last year: Kennesaw Mountain 30, Osborne 7All-time series: Kennesaw Mountain leads 4-1Prediction: Kennesaw Mountain 35, Osborne 14Even though the results of its next game won’t affect the region standings, Kennesaw Mountain still wishes to gain some momentum Friday when Osborne visits Cobb Energy/Mustang Stadium.Usually, once region competition starts, a team doesn’t have another non-region game until the end of the season or the first week of the playoffs. But for the second straight year, the Mustangs will briefly step away from region action to face the Cardinals, who are playing a complete non-region schedule.“If we desire to go to the playoffs, we’ve got to win some games,” Kennesaw Mountain coach Andy Scott said. “Our focus this week is not necessarily wins and losses but striving to improve and play our absolute best each Friday night, regardless of who we play against.”Before their bye last week, the Mustangs lost their region opener 56-21 to North Paulding.“The biggest thing we learned from that week is that North Paulding is a little bit better than we are,” Scott said. “They executed and played extremely well. We did not. Whenever you face a region opponent, you got to play your best and we didn’t.”Gregory Martinez, Dewan Warbington and Ryland Goede all scored touchdowns.As far as the Cardinals, they lost their last game as well, falling 41-0 to Harrison on Sept. 11.“I expect Osborne to come here and play extremely hard,” Scott said. “As we watched and evaluated film, one thing we saw is that they are playing with a bunch of kids who want to play football and want to be a part of the team. I think they are going to give us their best shot.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:12:16.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
