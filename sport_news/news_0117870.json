The NJSIAA received the report this month, but asked East Orange this week to look deeper into the issues. \nRELATED : No punishment yet in NJSIAA's investigation of East Orange boys basketball \n“There were still a couple things that we need them to further investigate and get back to us,” said NJSIAA assistant director Larry White, who oversees basketball for the organization. “I think in their mind they addressed the allegations. But they talked about a couple situations that we still have concerns with because as I see them they were still violations of our rules and regulations.” \nWhite said the allegations against East Orange are in reference to a “violation of our transfer rule in terms of what a bona fide change of residence is” and “recruitment.” \nThe East Orange program has enjoyed a resurgence under Lovett , who guided the Jaguars to a 25-5 record last season. Lovett also earned praise from East Orange Mayor Lester E. Taylor for implementing a rigorous study hall that helped several players make the honor roll and qualify for the National Honor Society and Presidential Academic Scholarships. \nWhite could not provide a timeline for when a decision would be made about East Orange. \nMatthew Stanmyre may be reached at mstanmyre@njadvancemedia.com .
