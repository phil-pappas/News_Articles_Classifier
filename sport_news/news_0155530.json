I’ve seen examples when it worked great. A team makes big changes at the deadline, and it takes off.\n“I’ve seen examples where doing almost nothing or small things is the right thing, and it’s hard. In our situation this year, what we were able to do at the deadline and August is add depth.”\nAnd avoid costly problems. Instead of acquiring Papelbon (who was acquired by the Washington Nationals from Philadelphia that included the cost of guaranteeing his 2016 contract at $11 million), the Cubs fortified their bullpen with the likes of left-hander Clayton Richard and Trevor Cahill in minor deals and landed closer Fernando Rodney from the Seattle Mariners on Aug. 27.\nRodney has settled in extremely well as a late-inning reliever. Papelbon, meanwhile, has a 3.04 ERA in 22 appearances but gained greater notoriety recently for charging All-Star right fielder Bryce Harper in the Washington Nationals’ dugout on Sunday and being suspended for the rest of the season.\n“I’ve know Jonathan for a long time, so I’d never disparage him,” said Hoyer, whose association with Papelbon dates to their time in Boston. “He had some unbelievable seasons in Boston.”\nBut Hoyer didn’t deny the additions of Richard, Dan Haren (acquired from the Miami Marlins on July 31), Tommy Hunter (from Baltimore), Cahill added depth.\n“To a man, the guys we’ve added have brought something to clubhouse and on the field,” Hoyer said.\nAnd Utley’s decision to accept a trade to the Los Angeles Dodgers has allowed Starlin Castro to flourish at second base after losing his starting job at shortstop, and a healthy Tommy La Stella has provided offense as a left-handed hitter at that position.\nUtley, 36, is batting only .205 with the Dodgers.\n“You never know how those things have to play out,” Hoyer said.\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Cubs Jonathan Papelbon Chase Utley Trevor Cahill Los Angeles Dodgers Clayton Richard Fernando Rodney", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dc24c/turbine/ct-cubs-additions-excel-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:00:37.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
