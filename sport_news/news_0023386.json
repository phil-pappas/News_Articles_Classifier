He’s a simple man who likes to keep things simple and just go out there and pitch. He’s been stellar for us all year.”\nThe Mets need one more stellar outing.\nDeGrom briefly got the attention of some of the Citi Field crowd when he began throwing in the bullpen during Tuesday’s defeat while starter Steven Matz was still on the mound.\nBut unlike with the Blue Jays on Monday, when manager John Gibbons brought in presumptive ALDS Game 5 starter David Price in the fifth inning, deGrom didn’t get on the field against Los Angeles and instead will start Thursday.\nMets manager Terry Collins said afterward deGrom might have pitched if Matz had been knocked out early, but once Matz survived a three-run third, deGrom threw a regular bullpen session.\nAfter Matz was unable to close out the Dodgers at home, deGrom now faces even more pressure. Yet if recent history is any indication, deGrom should be up to the challenge.\nHe certainly didn’t back down in the series opener, pitching seven scoreless innings, striking out 13 along the way. In that game, though, he was working with at least a small margin for error, with the knowledge the series couldn’t be won or lost that night.\nAt Chavez Ravine on Thursday, that won’t be the case.\nSo the veteran of 53 career major-league starts will pitch the biggest game of his career.\nIf the Mets are looking for some positives heading into Thursday, deGrom’s outstanding outing in Game 1 wasn’t the first time he had overpowered the Dodgers this season.\nBack on July 26 at Citi Field, the right-hander held Los Angeles scoreless for 7 ²/₃ innings, walking two and fanning eight while getting a no-decision in a 3-2 win.\nThe Mets’ offense managed to scratch two runs off the Dodgers starter and then another off the bullpen to pick up the win.\nThat Dodgers starter? Zack Greinke. The Mets would gladly accept the same outcome.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under jacob degrom ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:19:24.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
