Lucia vs Caida Tiles \nJumbo Plastic Linoleum relied on its solid defense to ground Euro-Med’s big guns and handed the team its first loss in the tournament after pulling off a 79-65 win in the PCBL Founders Cup at the Filoil Flying V Arena. \nThe win enabled Jumbo Plastic to forge a three-way tie for second to fourth places with its rival and idle Sta, Lucia with the same 2-1 win-loss record in this tournament being supported by Spalding, Accel, Aquabest and Ambucore. Caida Tiles continued to hold on to solo lead with a 3-0 record. \nPlaying small ball against Euro-Med, Jumbo Plastic neutralized high-scoring Bong Gallanza, who was held to just 10 points on a woeful 2-of-11 shooting from the field. \nWith Gallanza grounded, Euro-Med’s production suffered. The team shot below 35% from the field. \nBurly frontliner JR Taganas muscled his way for a double-double performance, tallying 20 points and 14 rebounds while Jeff Biernes contributed 12. Ex-pro Alvin Padilla and John Lopez added 10 apiece. \nThe scores: Cagayan (92) – Bangga 16, Isit 15, Doligon 11, Arce 9, Flores 9, Managuelad 6, Salcede 6, Caranguian 5, Brana 5, Acidre 4, Palma 4, Macasling 2, Siruma 0. \nSupremo Lex (70) – Gabayni 15, Marquez 13, Juanico 10, Bitoon 7, Belencion 7, Importante 7, Jornacion 6, Santos 3, Yaya 2, Cabrera 0, Rosales 0, Bargola 0, Olondriz 0. \nQuarterscores: 21-16; 44-29; 67-49; 92-70. \nJumbo Plastic (79) – Taganas 20, Biernes 12, Padilla 10, Lopez 10, Mandani 7, Arellano 6, Eugilos 6, Martinez 6, Acosta 2, Tayongtong 0, Alabanza 0, Lopez, M. 0, Perez 0. \nEuro-Med (65) — Villahermosa 10, Gallanza 10, Cortez 9, Alberto 9, Celso 8, Abundo 7, Custodio 5, Santos 4, De Leon 2, Cenal 1, Manalo 0. \nQuarterscores: 19-11; 40-27; 52-44; 79-65 Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:50:54.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
