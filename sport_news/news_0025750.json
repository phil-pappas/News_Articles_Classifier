But weekly players and season owners of Bradford should have confidence this week. He finally broke through last week and I love the matchup against the Saints. I like Nick Foles at Green Bay as my No. 2. \nHays Carlyon: It’s now-or-never this week for Bradford. New Orleans is giving up an average of 26 points a game. I wouldn’t touch him in a weekly format, but if you drafted him in a season league you should give him one last chance. \nRB JUSTIN FORSETT, RAVENS \nJB: He’s playing the Browns, who are as friendly to opposing fantasy backs as DraftKings and FanDuel are to their employees. If Forsett can find the end zone once, he’s probably a 20- to 25-point play. \nHC: I’m not as high on Forsett. The Ravens have no perimeter threats in their passing game, so Cleveland can load up to stop Forsett. And he hasn’t scored this season. \nWR KENDALL WRIGHT, TITANS \nJB: He’s coming off of a bye and has two quality games this season. The Bills are allowing an average of two passing TDs a game. He’s a fringe WR1 this week. \nHC: Good call here. Wright was targeted 12 times in his last outing. He should produce a 100-yard game with a score. \nTHREE TO SIT \nQB RUSSELL WILSON, SEAHAWKS \nHC: You probably have to start Wilson in a seasonal league, but I wouldn’t touch him in a weekly format. The Seahawks can’t protect him and that isn’t likely going to change at Cincinnati. Wilson was sacked six times Monday night against Detroit and rarely had a clean pocket. \nJB: Agreed. Over a season, Wilson will prove fantasy value. But he’s a low- to mid- 20s QB this week. Blake Bortles, Alex Smith and Joe Flacco are better plays. \nRB JEREMY HILL, BENGALS \nHC: Sure, he scored three times last week. What are the odds that happens again against Seattle? And his yardage totals merit concern. He gained 39, 21 and 40 yards rushing over the last three games. Giovani Bernard continues to take a large portion of the work. \nJB: That and he’s banged up, too (limited in Thursday’s practice with a knee issue). I’d start Bernard over Hill if you are picking between Cincy backs. \nWR MARTAVIS BRYANT, STEELERS \nHC: I like Bryant’s talent, but I’d be patient with him this week as he returns from a four-game suspension. Mike Vick likely won’t be able to get him the ball deep. Once Ben Roethlisberger is healthy, Bryant will become a must-start each week. The combination of Bryant being rusty and Vick’s skill set leads me away from him. \nJB: Pittsburgh will lean on Le’Veon Bell and lighten Vick’s load. Bryant is a risky pick in any format, even a flex, this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:46:13.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
