It will also address the issue of localized depletion, which is what happens when fishing takes more fish than can be replaced locally or through migration.\nAtlantic herring are used as both bait and food. Federal figures say the fishery was valued at about $31.9 million in 2013. That is the second highest figure since at least 1950.\nThe council is closing the public comment period about the impact of the herring fishery on Wednesday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:54:50.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
