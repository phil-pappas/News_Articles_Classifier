This one came from Maine-Endwell's Michael Palmer. It was the reversal game this morning. Seniors and juniors on the football team coach the senior girls against the junior girl. Take a look at this big hit Hannah George gives on her opponent. She is committed to play lacrosse at LeMoyne and you can tell she could play with the boys lacrosse team up there because she delivers the pain right here. It was a weekend filled with Balmer to Palmer specials and George sandwiches at M-E. I'm open to sharing everyone's videos so if you got em, you can be on the news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:00:21.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
