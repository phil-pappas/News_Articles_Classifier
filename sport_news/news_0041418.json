In 2014, he won bronze at the Sochi Winter Olympics ‚Äî just two weeks after breaking a rib in competition. \nThen he pressed pause, and made a movie. \n\"I felt it was really important for me as a snowboarder to get back to the roots,\" McMorris told CBC Sports on Thursday, a day before that movie, In Motion, debuts in Toronto. \"That's what [snowboarding] originated from, is riding backcountry and fresh tracks and stuff like that. \n\"I just wanted to gain that knowledge and respect, too.\" \nT DOT, mark your calendarsüá®üá¶ Oct 16th Queen Elizabeth Theatre 190 Princes' Blvd. Doors open 8pm Film starts at 9pm pic.twitter.com/9vO3fPCz78 ‚Äî @markmcmorris \nIn Motion , a title chosen with the help of McMorris's social media followers, takes him far away from carefully sculpted competition hills deep into the backcountry, to mountains accessible by helicopter only. \n\"I've taken it so far, to a level where it's like Olympics and television shows and all this stuff,\" he said. \"I can ride the backcountry.

Now that the film is done, he plans to focus more on competition this year to get ready for the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. \n\"I think the cool thing about competition is riding well when it matters,\" said McMorris. \"Doing your best when it really really counts. \n\"I love standing on top of the podium. It's the best feeling in the world.\" \nWhen asked if he thinks creating In Motion will have given him an edge in competition, the admittedly superstitious McMorris wouldn't go that far. \n\"Yeah, you could say that if you want,\" he said. \"I don't know if I'm going to say it though.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:22:20.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
