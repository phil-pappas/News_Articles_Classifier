(AP) — Anyone arriving a little early to a New York Mets game this season has probably witnessed “The Walk.” \nMatt Harvey, Jacob deGrom or some other emerging ace striding in from the bullpen following pregame warmups, with pitching coach Dan Warthen right alongside — and the rest of that fearless rotation trailing just behind. \nFor opposing hitters, it’s become an imposing march to impending doom. \nRiding four young starters all the way through October, the hard-throwing Mets are ready to fire their best stuff at the Kansas City Royals in the 111th World Series. Game 1 is Tuesday night at Kauffman Stadium, with Harvey set to pitch against Edinson Volquez. \n“I like our rotation no matter who’s out there,” New York manager Terry Collins said. “I’ve got a lot of confidence in them.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:21:46.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
