The Tigers have won their last four since losing to Bismarck-Henning on Sept. 11 while the Storm have won their last three since losing to the Blue Devils on Sept. 18. \nBut both teams have done it in different ways. While Westville sticks with the running game, Salt Fork mostly takes it to the air and both have been successful. \nIn Salt Fork’s 54-40 win over Fisher last week, Connor Taylor passed for 325 yards with seven touchdowns with three strikes to Blake Phillips, two to Caleb Fauver and one each to Andrew Gentrup and Josh Kimbro. \n“They are a great team that is well-coached,” Goodlove said. “(Taylor) can throw the ball straight and long and he has a bunch of weapons that can take a small play into a big play in a hurry. Every play is a chance for them to score.” \nLast week, the Tigers won 49-12 against Hoopeston Area/Schlarman Academy. Westville had five rushing touchdowns and two passing touchdowns. \n“We pass as well, but we are more of a run-first team and we depend a lot on our offensive line,” Goodlove said. “We like to think that we are a balanced offense and we go 50/50 and we just work with what is given to us.” \nOn defense, Goodlove said how the Tigers handle the Storm’s offense will tell the tale. \n“This is going to be one of our biggest challenges,” Goodlove said. “We are going to have to keep them in front of us because if they get past you, they are going to score. They have a lot of players that are just fast, get to the ball and make you miss.” \nThe game starts at 7 p.m on Friday. \n“I think everyone is going to see two great teams on Friday,” Goodlove said. “We are going to play hard and I know that they will do the same.” \nBismarck-Henning at Milford/Cissna Park \nTime — 7 p.m. Friday \nRecords — Bismarck-Henning 6-1 overall, 5-0 in Vermilion Valley Conference, Milford/Cissna Park 3-4, 1-3 \nStorylines — With the Blue Devils all but clinching the VVC once again, they travel to Milford to face a Bearcats team that has won their last two games.
