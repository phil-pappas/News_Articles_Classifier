KMPH Fox26 Sports Reporter Nick King shows us a special player from each team. \nEvery week on FNR, we see some really talented players. But there may not be any in the Valley, and honestly very few in the country, who stack up against Golden Eagle senior Caleb Kelly. On Thursday at Clovis West, the school honored Kelly for his invite to the U.S. Army All–American Bowl, which is as prestigious a high school all–star game as there is. \nClovis West Head Football Coach George Petrissans said, \"90 people get nominated for this game out of one million. You think about that figure, I mean that's an elite, elite percentage. Caleb was one of those guys obviously on the field, but he's probably a higher percentage as a person.\" \nKelly can legitimately pick any college in the country to play for next year. And his coach will tell you about his super long arms, incredible ball skills and great speed and size, but also that Kelly makes everyone around him feel included and special. And that he treated every recruiter with the utmost respect, from the big schools and the smaller ones. Plus, he's not afraid to call his mom his best friend. \"I hang out with her every day. We text when we don't see each other, when she's working overtime or whatever... she's always texting me, saying, 'I miss you...' My mom and I, we're just best friends. Like, we really are,\" said Kelly. \nNow the Tigers have a young man who wants to join the Army. He's hoping to attend West Point next year. Like Kelly, Edison defensive end Isaiah Domio is wildly impressive to talk to. And he's playing football for the very first time in his life. \nIsaiah Domio said, \"I love doing anything I can do that could get me involved in my five favorite categories: shooting, hiking, showing leadership, marksmanship, navigation – land navigation to be specific. I love map reading… on top of being able to go to airborne school, skydiving.\" \nEdison Head Football Coach Matt Johnson said, \"He's not a real football player yet. He's just developing that. He's a real, quality young man.\" \nDomio walks around school with a gallon of water, to stay hydrated. He's 6’ 3”, 210 pounds, with very little body fat, and he also wrestles, competes as an m–m–a fighter, and regularly delivers speeches to his team. \nCoach Johnson said, \"He is as put together – mentally, spiritually, everything you can imagine – better than anybody I've ever been associated with. And that goes for my college teammates to professional football, anybody. He is absolutely locked in.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:06:14.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
