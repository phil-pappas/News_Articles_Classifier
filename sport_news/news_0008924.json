They're just guys. Jordan Matthews has been the single most disappointing player on the team so far. It isn't just the drops - even though it has gotten to the point where you just have to make those catches, no kidding. He ran a sub-4.5 at the combine but he can't seem to run away from anybody. Then Nelson Agholor just looks like a puny rookie. And Riley Cooper . . . \nRich: Has Riley Cooper ever not begged for a flag after a play? I think he begs for a call even after he catches a touchdown. \nDave: Then Miles Austin looks like he's stumbling a lot of the time. Put it this way: All of those times Sam Bradford looked lost earlier in the season, it was almost always because nobody was open. Nobody can get away from anybody. Boy, do they miss Jeremy Maclin. He was underrated by a lot of people in this town, including a lot of people in this media. \nRich: OK. Now it's time for our weekly discussion of Chip and The Scheme. Can I call you Mr. Scheme? \nDave: Just make your point. \nRich: I'm conceding something here. They did change some things up against the Saints. They played more from under center and ran the ball out of that. They played a bunch of two tight ends, and that was different. It was weird - they threw great out of it but didn't run all that well out of it. And the opposite - they ran great out of three wide receivers and the shotgun. You saw two running backs a couple of times. You saw, when they ran out of the shotgun, that instead of the back always lining up to the left and running to the right, or always lining up to the right and running to the left, that sometimes he lined up to the left and ran the same way. They really hadn't showed a lot of that before. You wonder if there's value in just showing different stuff. \nDave: I think there's a lot of value in it - that's what I've been saying for weeks when they were lining up with three wideouts something like 85 percent of the time in certain games. This was the first game where they did something and you said to yourself, \"You know, I don't think I've seen them do that before.'' \nRich: Do you follow Joe Banner on Twitter? \nDave: Yeah. \nRich: He's really excellent. And he's been making the point about Chip Kelly that he isn't really worried about the offense because he knows Kelly will come up with changes as needed, like the two tight ends last week, that will make a difference. He's been making the point that coaching really matters, and that one of the undertold stories this year in the league is how much Seattle misses Dan Quinn (its former defensive coordinator) now that he's in Atlanta. I know I'm guilty of thinking that all coaches are pretty smart because they all work so hard. It can be pretty intimidating when you think about everything they know and the number of hours they put in. But they all don't belong on a pedestal. Some guys are just a lot smarter than other guys. \nDave: Take this last game. First of all, New Orleans might just be really, really, really, really bad. \nRich: Four reallys. \nDave: Really. But Rob Ryan is . . . how can I put this? You know how they say there's one in every family? Well, I've got news for you - he's the one. They're just not good. I watched the Eagles games against the Redskins and Saints, back to back. And either the Redskins are really good or the Saints are really bad or some combination of the two. It was interesting. Watching the Redskins tape, before every play, you saw Jason Kelce signaling and then you saw the middle linebacker reacting - calling stuff out, moving guys around. And the Saints didn't do any of that. You do wonder if they just beat a crappy team. And then, some coaches are really dumb. \nRich: People thought Andy Reid was dumb sometimes. I never did, but . . . \nDave: Yeah, I never did, either. But Andy was frustrating - because you knew he was smart, you knew he got it, and then there would just be these moments. He'd have that game against the Raiders where they threw it about 60 times. They were within a touchdown the entire time but he just insisted on throwing it 60 times. Kelly, I think he will adapt. But it just blows my mind that he waited until Week 5 to start mixing some of this stuff in. I don't understand why you wouldn't mix it up from the very beginning - especially when you consider that the stuff you were doing wasn't working. \nRich: I've been thinking about that a little bit. I know he's a smart guy, and he knows he's a smart guy, and maybe some of his pride was involved. But I really don't think you get very far in his business by being overly proud. I think there's a chance he made a calculation here: that he had so many new players on offense, and that he had to keep things maybe a little simpler because of all the new players, and that's why he didn't vary things very much. I mean, they're always going to be a three-wideout team, that's their bread-and-butter, so they worked to establish their bread-and-butter but now, over time, he's starting to bring more variety. Does that make any sense? \nDave: It does. But I think it really surprised him how bad they could be. They just had so many negative plays. I really think he was taken aback by that, and maybe it took him a little time to process it all. It's not a sin to see that people are starting to figure out what you're doing. But you have to be willing to change. And it seems obvious that they all looked a little more comfortable when they were varying things. \nRich: Which leads to this week. Steve Spagnuolo, a.k.a. Jim Johnson Jr., is running the Giants' defense. Do you figure he decides to blitz the hell out of Bradford? \nDave: The Eagles have had very good pass protection this year overall. I think teams are much more worried about stopping the Eagles' running game right now. I think they're all lined up to do that and they're more than willing to let Sam Bradford and those receivers try to beat them. I don't know what the Giants are going to do. Their defense has played well, but who have they played? \nRich: On the other side of the ball, to me, the whole game is getting to Eli. I don't think they can win if they don't throw him around a little bit. I don't know who's going to be playing receiver for the Giants, and that's obviously a big thing - no Odell Beckham would obviously be a gift from the gods. But if Eli has time to just throw it up there to those guys, we've seen what can happen. But if they can knock him around, it'll be really big as far as the division race. \nDave: I think whoever wins this game is the favorite to win the division. \nRich: I really thought Dallas would be able to keep bobbing along and keep their head above water until Romo and Dez got back. I don't know anymore. \nDave: I don't think they can. When you look at the Eagles' schedule, when you look at everything, I really think the winner of this one is favored to win the division.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:33:31.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
