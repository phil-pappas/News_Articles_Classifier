Among those being honored that night will be former Hatter basketball and baseball star Clayton Haviland . \nWhile at Danbury High, Haviland excelled at both sports and served as baseball captain his senior year. After his high school graduation, he continued his academic and athletic career at Cornell University . \nHaviland graduated from Cornell in 1956 and was a three-year varsity baseball player. He continued his baseball career for many years in the Danbury Intra City League as a manager, coach and player. In 1957 he batted .379 and was league MVP. Aside from being a great two-sport athlete from Danbury High, Haviland enjoyed a long, successful teaching and coaching career which began in 1957. \nWhile teaching chemistry at Danbury High School, he also coached the baseball team for 20 years. His teams were always competitive and very successful and won county and conference championships. He provided many athletes with the skills to have successful college baseball, coaching and professional careers, including DHS Hall of Fame inductees Harry Trohalis , who played shortstop in the College World Series as the UConn shortstop, and Art Haddad , who continued his baseball playing career at Mount Saint Mary’s in Maryland. DHS baseball standout Dave Patterson made it to the pros. As successful high school baseball coaches, former DHS baseball players John Iovino and Shaun Ratchford have had great success in state and league tournament play and with players that went on to professional careers. \nAs a coach, one of Haviland’s fondest memories was the victory over Naugatuck High School , which had been undefeated for three years. In state tournament play, Danbury was losing 3-1 in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, the bases loaded, and a full count on the batter. Haviland called for a squeeze, and the batter, Mike Bonacci , laid down a perfect bunt which scored three runs. Danbury won 4-3. \nHaviland received his Master’s degree from Fairfield University . He was married for many years to the love of his life, Betsy Baldwin , until her passing in 2013. They have five children, 12 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. The long-time teacher, coach and two-sport Danbury High athlete is spending his retirement enjoying the many activities of his grandchildren. \nFor tickets to the banquet at the Amber Room, contact Betsy Merullo at 203-744-1223.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:21:41.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
