No way was he OK with heading to Baltimore on Friday not having a playoff spot locked up, his team's destiny in the hands of another's. \nSo Girardi did the only logical thing: he called on right/sure-handed Adam Warren to pitch 3.0 innings to secure New York's first playoff berth since 2012 . \nThey were as crucial as any innings thrown by a Yankee pitcher this season. \nWarren, the do-everything hurler for the Yankees this season shut out the Red Sox over the sixth, seventh, and eighth inning Thursday en route to a 4-1 victory at Yankee Stadium that ended in champagne celebrations inside the Yankees' clubhouse until well past midnight . \n\"Every good club that I've been on has seemed to have a guy like Adam Warren that is able to do so many different things for you as a pitcher,\" Girardi said Thursday. \"His value has been as big as any pitcher that we have in that room. Look at what he did tonight. He was a big reason we won that game because he was able to give us three innings...He did the job. He's invaluable.\" \nFor this Yankees team, he might be. The 28-year-old Warren started the season as a starter, sliding into the rotation's No. 5 start. In 14 starts he had a 3.59 ERA, second-best on the team. But in late June his innings began to creep up and Ivan Nova was returning from surgery. Warren was banished to the bullpen, a move he wasn't in love with. \nBut then Warren became even better in the bullpen, posting a 2.51 ERA in 30 appearances from June 30 to September 9, and in all has thrown more than one inning 11 times this year, more than any Yankee reliever all season. \nHe had come to the ballpark Thursday unsure of his current role on the team. \n\"I just prepared like I was out of the bullpen,\" Warren said. \"I was just focused on one hitter, (then) one inning. And they said, 'Can you go another?' I said, yeah. They said, 'Can you go another?' I said, yeah. Being built up helps, and I was just ready to do anything they needed.\" \nWarren was \"built up\" because he had, of course, been starting the last two weeks, the team needing someone to step in for the struggling Nova and injured Nathan Eovaldi. His 51 pitches against the Sox were no sweat. And Girardi said there's nothing that will keep him from having Warren start a playoff game if that's what it comes to. \nOne would think the back-and-forth from starter to reliever might mess with a guy's head. \n\"I feel like I've got it down,\" Warren said. \"I don't know. Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't, but I'm going to try to be as prepared as possible. I feel like going back and forth has helped me. Hopefully if that's the case I'll get some days to prepare, get my body right, and just mentally prepare. I'm prepared to do whatever they need.\" \nPerhaps that last quote sums up Warren better than any other. Girardi, on more than one occasion this year, has compared Warren to Ramiro Mendoza, a Yankees starter/reliever who was part of four World Series winning teams in his career from 1996 to 2005. \n\"It's funny because coming to the ballpark today, you didn't even think about pitching today, and then all of a sudden you're kind of thrown into the fire,\" Warren said. \"You want to pitch in those games, so to get that opportunity was pretty exciting for me and to help the team win.\" RELATED : John Ryan Murphy sums up playoff celebration perfectly \nThe Yankees are guaranteed at least one playoff game, next Tuesday, in the form of a Wild Card game, and possibly a handful of others if they can win it. While Girardi will call on Dellin Betances as early as possible to get the ball to closer Andrew Miller, Warren figures to be the guy who gets the ball to Betances if it requires several innings. \nOr of course he may also be starting games. No one, including he, will really know until probably 24—or four—hours until game time. He said he didn't know he was going to be relieving on Thursday until about 3:30 in the afternoon. \n\"I'm trying to be as flexible as possible and not worry about whether I'm starting or relieving,\" Warren said. \"Just trying to take it one day at a time and help the team any way possible.\" \nWhere would the Yankees be without Adam Warren this season? They would be waking up in their Baltimore hotel Friday morning, just as they are. The only difference is they may not all still be soaked in champagne. \nRyan Hatch may be reached at rhatch@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @ryanhatch .
