Because I care about you, dear WRAL readers and 99.9FM The Fan listeners, I put my stomach on the line and tried out as many gut-busters as possible. \nLet's start with the deep-fried peanut butter pickle, which has generated the most buzz leading up to the Fair. For strategic purposes, the pickle was the last item on my menu because I wasn't sure I'd be able to eat anything else after such a combination of flavors. …and now, for my final performance, the deep fried pickle. pic.twitter.com/syE2CX3sa3 — Joe Ovies (@joeovies) October 12, 2015 As you can see in my facial reaction, the mash-up of a sour pickle with the sweetness of peanut butter and fried dough was way too much to handle. This monstrosity is not for the feint of heart.

First on the menu. pic.twitter.com/iMeKlIkFwm — Joe Ovies (@joeovies) October 12, 2015 Fried pork chop topped with BBQ, bacon, pickle & slaw.
