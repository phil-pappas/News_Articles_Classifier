Gregory", "Smith"], "text": "While the golfers count their strokes, D.J. Gregory counts his steps, two of his covering the distance of one of ours.\nHe’s a golf fan who walks tournament courses, mostly those on the PGA Tour. He moves with the gallery, finding his path outside the ropes, listing left and right as if he were on a tightrope, sometimes falling, sometimes catching himself with his cane but always chasing a balance that he has never been able to take for granted.\nBorn with cerebral palsy, Gregory, 37, of Henderson, N.C., will come to Orange County next week for the Champions Tour’s Toshiba Classic at Newport Beach Country Club.\nHe will accompany two-time U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen during the tournament’s three rounds, which begin next Friday.\n“I’m excited for this one because I’ve never done this course before,” said Gregory by phone. “It’s always fun to walk a new venue, get the lay of the land and be on the West Coast.”\nWalking, not playing, is the athletic feat for this man whom doctors once believed would spend his life in a wheelchair.\nHe began following golf at age 12, watching the sport on television and going to events with his father. He picked up the game, too, swinging with the club in his right hand and the steadying cane in left to shoot in the mid 90s.\nSince 2008, he set out to walk every hole of every course on the PGA Tour. That first year, he walked 3,256 holes, traversing more than 988 miles.\nHe hasn’t stopped. In the past eight years, he has averaged attending about 48 events a year, pairing with a competitor each time, and has walked more than 400 courses.\nSix years ago, he started the Walking for Kids Foundation, with PGA Tour pros pledging donations for each eagle and birdie they make while Gregory is in the gallery and fans contributing for the ground he covers. He also holds a yearly charity pro-am tournament.\nGregory has raised more than a half a million dollars for children’s charities, inspiring fans each step of the way.\nHis favorite course is Pebble Beach. His first stop of the year is usually January’s Hyundai Tournament of Champions at the Plantation Course at Kapalua on Maui, which “is the steepest and the hardest for me to walk because there’s nothing flat, but I get to spend my birthday in Hawaii,” he said.\nHe has witnessed Davis Love III, Jeff Sluman and Will MacKenzie hit holes in one and seen Rickie Fowler, of Murrieta, eagle a hole from 130 yards out at Doral in Miami, Fla.\nHe has followed four golfers – Ben Crane, Hunter Mahan, Zach Johnson and Jason Day – en route to five victories. Gregory’s first victory stroll came in January 2010, when Crane carded a final-round 70 to win the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines by a stroke.\nGregory kept pace with Orange-born Mahan for two victories, their first at the 2012 WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at Dove Mountain, in Marana, Ariz. His most recent triumph came with Day in August at the 2015 PGA Championship at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wis. Day held off Jordan Spieth for his first career major championship.\n“I walk with Jason three times a year, including the U.S. Open, which we’ve done six times together and gotten in the top 10 five times and never missed a cut,” said Gregory proudly. “I love it when the players who choose to have me walk with them win.”\nGolf can be an exclusive sport, but not for Gregory, who cherishes it most because of the friendships he has made along the way.\n“Rickie Fowler is one of my best friends,” Gregory said. “A lot of the guys are. Whether or not I walk with them, they check in on me all the time, and am happy to see me when I’m out on the course.”\nThey’ve asked him if it hurts to walk with cerebral palsy. He tells them, “I’m not any more tired than you are. I don’t look at my life as though I’m disabled. I can do everything you can but some things take me longer.”\nThey’ve wondered whether he feels pain from the jagged gait that took five surgeries to get him to be this mobile. He says, “I feel no pain,” and smiles from the joy of having found his place in the game.\n“I’ve taken some nasty spills, which I’ve been known to do every once in a while,” Gregory said. “Some people rush over to help me, but it’s easier if I get up on my own. I’m pretty stubborn, and I’m a professional faller.”\nAnd next week, Gregory will be walking among the pros at Toshiba Classic, trailing Janzen on every hole at Newport Beach and keeping up with the game.\nBecause Gregory can.\nContact the writer: masmith@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:12:01.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
