The Jayhawks would go on to a 10-2 record, Mason's best with the program. \n20 YEARS AGO/OCT. 7, 1995 \nKANSAS 40, COLORADO 24 \nBOULDER, Colo. — Kansas was a decided underdog. With Colorado coming in as the No. 4 team in the country, Glen Mason sold no one on the Jayhawks’ chances. \nExcept his own squad. \n“This wasn’t an upset,” insisted the KU coach. “It’s only an upset in your mind if you think you’re a lesser team. I never felt that way. I very seldom go out on the line and tell my players that we’re going to win, but I told them that all the way here. Maybe it was in the stars of the horoscope, but I just had that feeling.” \nThe undefeated Jayhawks (5-0, 1-0 Big Eight) actually came into Folsom Field ranked 24th, and would climb to No. 10 in the polls the following week after their first victory against a top-10 opponent since 1984. \nKansas played a clean game. It committed no turnovers while forcing Colorado (5-1, 1-1) into four second-half turnovers. Two of those takeaways led to KU touchdowns. In addition, Spencer Bonner blocked a punt that teammate Manolito Jones returned for the game’s first touchdown and a 9-0 lead for the Jayhawks. \nSenior quarterback Mark Williams completed 25 of 35 passes for 299 yards. June Henley added 137 yards rushing on 23 carries and put the game out of reach with a 43-yard touchdown romp. \n“We had a couple of key drives that put us up, and we just kept rolling,’’ Williams said. “We just tried to put it all together. We knew we had this in our package.’’ \nThe Buffs were in their first season under Rick Neuheisel. The Jayhawks went on to tie for second in the Big 12 and finished 10-2 overall — Mason’s best record at KU — with a win in the Aloha Bowl. \nBIG 12 TACKLING DRILL \nHOT SHOT \nQB/WR Kody Cook, Kansas State \nNo, Cook did not finish last week’s loss at Oklahoma State. He went out with a fourth-quarter shoulder injury. But the work he did as, let’s see, K-State’s fifth-string quarterback, was amazing. Cook delivered immediately as the Cats built a halftime lead. Not bad for a former walk-on who is a receiver by trade. \nCOLD SPOT \nBig 12 officiating \nFor a second straight week, Big 12 refs came under scrutiny. First, the crew working Texas’ game against Oklahoma State threw a costly, and questionable, flag on Charlie Strong. Then last week, another crew could not get the chains positioned correctly, helping OSU with a third-down conversion on a TD drive. \nMUST-SEES \nNo. 9 Oklahoma (4-0, 1-0) vs. Texas (0-2, 1-4) \n11 a.m. Saturday (at Dallas), ABC \nA halftime tweet prompted Texas players to confirm the divide between younger players and veterans. Maybe the renewal of an age-old rivalry in the Cotton Bowl promotes some bonding. Probably not. Oklahoma forced five turnovers and seven sacks last week, and has Baker Mayfield executing the attack. \nIowa State (2-2, 1-0) at Texas Tech (3-2, 0-2) \n2:30 p.m. Saturday, Fox Sports Net \nHey, Sam Richardson can win a Big 12 game. By beating Kansas last week, the Iowa State quarterback ended a string of 14 straight losses in league starts. Texas Tech is stinging from back-to-back losses to TCU and Baylor and will look at this as a get-well game. QB Patrick Mahomes is the Big 12 passing leader. \nNo. 21 Oklahoma State (5-0, 2-0) at West Virginia (3-1, 0-1) \n6 p.m. Saturday, ESPN2 \nBetter to be lucky than good. After winning two Big 12 games with late field goals by Ben Grogan, an appraisal of OSU is difficult. QB Mason Rudolph threw for a career-best 437 yards last week against Kansas State. West Virginia had its defense exposed by Oklahoma. Offensive efficiency is an issue. \nNATIONAL TACKLING DRILL \nHOT SHOT \nRB Ezekiel Elliott, Ohio State \nThe St. Louis junior rushed for 274 yards on 23 carries and busted second-half touchdown runs of 55, 65 and 75 yards last week as the Buckeyes outlasted Indiana. Elliott became the first FBS player in 10 years to score on three rushes of 50-plus yards. He leads the Big Ten with his 145.8-yard rushing average. \nCOLD SPOT \nSouth Carolina flooding, fizzling \nFlooding in the city of Columbia prompted South Carolina to move its game against LSU to Baton Rouge. With classes canceled, it was determined the stress placed on the city’s recovering infrastructure could not handle a game-day turnout. The Gamecocks, 0-3 in the SEC, struggle home and away in football. \nMUST-SEES \nNavy (4-0) at No. 15 Notre Dame (4-1) \n2:30 p.m. Saturday, NBC \nLook at the undefeated team in this matchup. Navy has not played nearly as difficult of a schedule, but the Midshipmen will be poised for an upset. Notre Dame must overcome the disappointment of a failed two-point conversion that kept the Irish from forging overtime in last week’s 24-22 loss at Clemson. \nMiami (3-1, 0-0) at No. 12 Florida State (4-0, 2-0) \n7 p.m. Saturday, ABC \nThe Seminoles’ Dalvin Cook leads the ACC in rushing but is slowed by a tender hamstring. That could require QB Everett Golson to step up. The Hurricanes are in jeopardy of losing their seventh straight in the series. That’s happened only once, from 1963-72, before Miami was known universally as “The U.” \nNo. 23 Cal (5-0, 2-0) at No. 5 Utah (4-0, 1-0) \n9 p.m. Saturday, ESPN \nUtah is rated No. 1 by ESPN’s power index, riding the strength of a convincing upset at Oregon. RB Devontae Booker is a reliable threat. The Bears are averaging 43.4 points and have forced 18 turnovers, tops in the Pac-12. QB Jared Goff leads the turnaround orchestrated by third-year coach Sonny Dykes. \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:57:57.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
