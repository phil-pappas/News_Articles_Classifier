We were blasting 'old school' music in the locker room. The three of us circled around our teammates, and the dance party commenced. We had a special play list for the night, featuring one of our favorites, Salt-N-Pepa's \"Push it\". It's not exactly traditional for a bunch of teenage girls. The jocularity calmed some nerves, but we did not lose sight of our goal.\" \nLaGuardia appreciated the tradition that her school has in the sport. \n\"Wayne Hills has become a driving force in the scope of Passaic County field hockey,\" she said. \"Although some of us have been a part of our school's previous County championships, this was definitely a transition year for us. A handful of teammates and I moved to new positions this year. We all knew the importance of defending the title, despite being a young team. We were ready to use our athleticism and competitiveness to go for the three-peat.\" \nLaGuardia and her teammates had a lot of respect for Pompton Lakes. \nAt 5:30 p.m., the team ventured to the field for warm-ups. \n\"Stepping outside, it became evident that the seasons were changing,\" LaGuardia said. \"It didn't bother us. We were focused, ready, and determined. With music blasting, we began taking warm-ups. The crowd began to fill the bleachers. Many Hills supporters cheered in the stands, bringing energy to the scene.\" \nAn hour or so later, it was game time. \n\"When I talked to my teammates, they relayed their sentiments about the game,\" LaGuardia said. \"Nerves didn't seem to overtake us, as we took the field. Our goalie, Rachel, has been the unsung hero of the season. She's a strong force in goal. Rachel recalled being anxious, but using that nervousness as motivation. As always, she has a bird's-eye view from the goal post and constantly encourages us from her standpoint. This game was no different.\" \nLaGuardia and her teammates had a lot of respect for Pompton Lakes. \n\"A battle soon ensued on the field,\" she said. \"Pompton Lakes came to play. They were ready to defend, having done their homework by scouting our games before the matchup and knowing exactly where they needed to be. Their defense was tough and I knew it wasn't going to be easy to score. \n\"On the field, we were communicating, using our vision of the field to assist each other. Our defense was meshing. The team dynamics were there. Although we had a few breakaways, the score remained (scoreless) at halftime. It was going to be a battle until the end. None of us gave up.\" \nByrne's game-winning goal was the result of hard work. \n\"The back and forth action continued,\" said Amanda. \"After a timeout in the second half, we emerged from the huddle with a sense of urgency. Just a few minutes after, Liz scored. A sense of relief and excitement overcame us. Liz knew the importance of the goal and was just excited to be able to put the team ahead. We responded, we fought, and we finished. The final minutes on the clock were up and we came away with a 1-0 victory.\" \nThe postgame celebration was memorable. \n\"Our locker room moments remind us of the strong bonds and friendships that sports can foster and the fun we can have while still having success,\" said LaGuardia. \"We are proud that our bond remains evident on the field and contributes to our success this season. We accomplished an impressive feat. We are eager to finish out the season strong and use our growth to drive us forward. With another county championship, we are continuing to establish ourselves as competitors in the state.\" \nThe third straight PCT championship is the second longest streak for Wayne Hills. The Patriots won seven straight crowns from 1977-1983. \nAmanda LaGuardia contributed to this story Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:33:36.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
