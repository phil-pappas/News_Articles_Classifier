He was unanimously elected the board president, with political bigwigs, bureaucrats, industrialists and ex-cricketers - among those who oversee the administration of the game across the country - present for the official coronation. Minutes after taking charge, Manohar listed his priorities and promised a flurry of reforms within two months. \"Just give me two months... all these things about which I have spoken will be implemented in full force,\" he said.\n\"Srinivasan was a great (BCCI) secretary. The best after Jagmohan Dalmiya,\" Manohar said, making it clear that he always had respect for Srinivasan's administrative abilities. However, it was in the backdrop of all the scandals and controversies the last two years that Manohar became a strong critic of Srinivasan, saying the latter should have quit the board once the Supreme Court found his son-in-law guilty of betting and conflict of interest began to raise its ugly head in the administration.\nThe effort to be transparent at all times has been an inherent quality of Manohar's, one that has seen him earn the respect of most BCCI administrators who come from far more affluent and influential backgrounds. His initiative in 2010 to call off the IPL franchise auction after doubts over rigging had emerged and bringing out a fresh tender was one of Manohar's earlier successful attempts in bringing transparency within BCCI, a process that concluded with the suspension of Lalit Modi.\n\"The first thing would be with regard to conflict of interest issues,\" he said on Sunday. The board will frame regulations on this within a month's time, and also appoint an independent ombudsman or ethics officer who will look into complaints (be it against administrators, players or the staff), he added.\nThose who have Manohar's ear insist he wasn't interested in returning to BCCI, particularly once he had made it clear that he wouldn't get involved in its day-to-day administration any further. However, after Dalmiya's sudden demise and for lack of a consensus candidate, he was asked to come forward once again and he obliged. All six representatives from East Zone - once considered Srinivasan's backyard - nominated Manohar for president and he was given the chair without an election.\n\"The BCCI is a huge brand in itself. This brand was created because of the love of the fans. In the last few years, the confidence of cricket fans has been shaken due to certain unpleasant things. It is the duty of all members of the board to build back the reputation for which a lot of administrators have worked hard,\" he said.\nGiven the way he likes to function, the coming months should certainly see a shakeup within BCCI.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:09:31.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
