I’ve never seen it before since I started with the team. I’ve never seen anybody indulging in that act and players are called based on merit.” \nThe Wa All Stars ex-manager believes being in charge of the national U-17 team is not easy because, according to him, players at that stage are of raw talent which requires a lot of work to groom. \n“The U-17 team is the most difficult part of the national side because that’s the area the players are picked as raw materials and don’t have the basics. You need to spot the talents and nurture them. Managing that level is very, very difficult,” he emphasized.
