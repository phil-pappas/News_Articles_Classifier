(AFP) \nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal said his side's clinical 3-0 victory at Everton had boosted confidence ahead of the midweek trip to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League. First-half goals from Morgan Schneiderlin and Ander Herrera and a strike by Everton old boy Wayne Rooney gave United the spoils in a one-sided Premier League contest at a Goodison Park mourning the loss of former manager Howard Kendall on Saturday. United crashed to a 3-0 defeat at Arsenal prior to the international break and Van Gaal was thrilled by their return to form, which saw Rooney net only his second league goal of the campaign.\"It was a very good performance and I said to my players that I am very proud of them because it is one of our best matches,\" said the Dutchman, whose side tackle CSKA in the Russian capital on Wednesday.\"We needed that because Everton are a very good team. We controlled the game for 80 minutes and only when the referee gave free-kicks around the 60-metre mark were Everton dangerous, because (Ross) Barkley can take free-kicks.\"I have seen a lot of individual players today (Saturday) playing very good, but that's also because the result is very good.\"We got more confidence and you could see that in the second half. I was very happy.\" The match was tinged with sadness after news broke prior to kick-off that Kendall, Everton's most successful and most popular manager, had passed away at the age of 69 following a heart attack. Kendall had an illustrious playing career at Goodison, winning the First Division title - the precursor to the Premier League - in 1970, before assuming the managerial mantle on three separate occasions. He delivered the league title twice, in 1985 and 1987, the FA Cup in 1984 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1985 during a halcyon spell where Everton and neighbours Liverpool dominated the English football landscape. Fans applauded throughout a pre-match moment of remembrance and players from both sides sported black armbands. But there were few echoes of the famous passing style inculcated by Kendall as Everton failed to impose themselves on United. Van Gaal's side took the lead in the 18th minute when Steven Naismith's clearance fell to Marcos Rojo. The Argentine defender's shot deflected off Chris Smalling and into the path of the unmarked Schneiderlin, who calmly passed the ball past Tim Howard from 12 yards. Slack Everton defending was to blame again four minutes later as Seamus Coleman clattered into Anthony Martial, which gave Rojo the space down the left wing he needed to whip in a cross that Herrera clinically converted. Everton responded impressively after the break and showed more heart, but they had precious little end product and Rooney sealed United's win in the 62nd minute, charging through on goal to comfortably beat Howard.\"I'm very happy for him, but for me it is not important if he scores or not,\" added Van Gaal of Rooney, whose side remain third, below Arsenal on goal difference, ahead of next weekend's derby with leaders Manchester City.\"He has to be an attacking player, doing his job when we are defending. I am very happy when he scores. Maybe it is a start for many, many goals now because he needed this goal, I think.\" Everton manager Roberto Martinez refused to make excuses for his side and said they had not been unduly affected by the news of Kendall's death.\"We were shocked at the news,\" he said. \"I wouldn't want to think (that it affected the players). It was really, really sad, but we wanted to change it around and make it a real celebration.\"It was a really disappointing day and it is one we need to understand. We wasted the first-half performance. We were slow, we couldn't see a forward pass and we were very negative.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:01:34.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
