Now it seems Golden has lost the support of prominent Miami alumni as well. \nWarren Sapp was first, sending several tweets critical of Golden and explicitly calling for his firing. Thank U ABC! #FireHim \n— Warren Sapp (@WarrenSapp) October 24, 2015 Well the mascot leads US out of the smoke?, I guess it's his team. #AlGottaGo pic.twitter.com/BiAYEFSNOU \n— Warren Sapp (@WarrenSapp) October 24, 2015 Why is Al the only coach on our sidelines without the U on Him? #SomebodyHelpMeWithThis \n— Warren Sapp (@WarrenSapp) October 24, 2015 \nSapp wasn’t alone. Former offensive lineman Leon Searcy was critical of Miami’s play. That face you make when Miami down 21-0 pic.twitter.com/6aPc2PRqaD \n— Leon Searcy (@leonsearcy72) October 24, 2015 \nFormer Miami All-American offensive lineman Bryant McKinnie sent several tweets critical of Golden and the program as a whole. Alumni can't even be on sidelines anymore, which is crazy to me. When I was there & seeing Sapp, Irvin,Testaverde made u play even harder \n— Bryant Mckinnie (@BryantMckinnie) October 24, 2015 Now ur trapped way up in a skybox smh! Those guys would be on the sideline giving advice as well. \n— Bryant Mckinnie (@BryantMckinnie) October 24, 2015 Time to head in a new direction as a program, enough is enough & I sat back & have been patient & quite long enough. \n— Bryant Mckinnie (@BryantMckinnie) October 24, 2015 UM better take a page out the Dolphins notebook & y'all know what I mean \n— Bryant Mckinnie (@BryantMckinnie) October 24, 2015 \nAnother former offensive lineman, Joaquin Gonzalez, was perhaps the most blunt in his criticism of Golden. @GoldenAl @CanesAllAccess I'm done holding my tongue! This guy needs to leave south Florida….I will buy his plane ticket!!! Economy!!! \nMiami athletic director Blake James previously said that Golden’s position would not be evaluated until after the season . It remains to be seen if this latest embarrassment changes his mind.
