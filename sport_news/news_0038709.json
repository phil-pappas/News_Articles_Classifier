The line has come together to help the Bucs reach 6-1. Game: Hiram (3-3, 2-3) at Allatoona (6-1, 5-1) 7:30 p.m. Last year: Allatoona 35, Hiram 21 All-time series: Allatoona leads 3-0Prediction: Allatoona 40, Hiram 23Allatoona has reeled off six consecutive wins, with its offense averaging more than 40 points during the streak. The Buccaneers’ offensive line, which had to replace four graduated starters from last season, has been a major contributor to the success.“We’ve had changes from last year to the unit and it’s been a work in progress,” Allatoona coach Gary Varner said as he prepared for tonight’s trip to Hiram. “Our offensive line is coming together and getting better every week.”The Buccaneers have also improved as an entire team since the loss to East Paulding to start the year. “The defeat was an eye opener and we learned from it,” Varner said. “We knew we had to get better.”The Buccaneers will look to use their rushing attack, which has averaged nearly 280 yards a game, to attack a Hornets’ defense that has allowed more than 30 points a contest. Hiram opponents have scored 40 or more points in three games this season including last week’s 43-17 home loss to Alexander.Allatoona running back Russell Halimon comes into the game with 1,193 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns on the season.“Hiram’s defense likes to use different types of blitz packages, so our offensive line will have to decipher them,” Varner said.Hiram also had a run-based offense using an option attack and have averaged 25 points a contest. The Buccaneers’ defense have allowed opponents to score 16 points a game.“Hiram’s offense is tough to face, so we will have to play our assignments on defense,” Varner said.Allatoona sits atop the Region 5 standings, a half-game ahead of Alexander and East Paulding, which also each have one region loss. The Buccaneers are in first place due to playing one more region game than the Raiders and Cougars. This week, Alexander hosts Villa Rica while East Paulding visits Lithia Springs.Hiram is tied for fourth in the standings with New Manchester and Chapel Hill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:11:08.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
