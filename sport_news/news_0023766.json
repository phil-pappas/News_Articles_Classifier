Earnhardt remained on the track for five laps before his right front tire went down, bringing out the caution and causing him to pit. \nHe was 35th on the restart. \nIt's been a struggle so far for Hendrick Motorsports. \nKasey Kahne hit the wall on lap 58 and went behind the wall. Jeff Gordon was the only Chase driver running outside of the top 15 before Earnhardt's wreck. Jimmie Johnson was knocked out of the Chase last week. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:50:32.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
