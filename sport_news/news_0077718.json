Since he was benched, Manuel has endured a coaching change, fought through a quarterback competition only to land at No. 3 on the depth chart and ended up back in the lineup due to Buffalo trading Matt Cassel and Tyrod Taylor spraining his MCL.\nManuel's first test as a starter will come against the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals, a team with a strong front seven and an offense that will be tough to keep up with.\nAll Manuel ever wanted was another shot, though, and this is it.\nKnow the enemy The Bengals are coming into Orchard Park on an absolute tear. They have won their first five games and are fresh off a comeback victory against the defending NFC champion Seattle Seahawks. Andy Dalton is off to his best start as a pro, and having wide receiver A.J. Green and tight end Tyler Eifert to throw to certainly hasn't hurt him. Combine that passing offense with an offensive line that run blocks at a high level for two running backs that complement one another perfectly, and it's easy to see what makes this offense so tough to defend.\nCincinnati is as tough on defense as it is dangerous on offense. The front four is led by dominant defensive tackle Geno Atkins, but bookend defensive ends Carlos Dunlap and Michael Johnson complete one of the most impressive front fours in the NFL. The Bengals' secondary is certainly beatable, but Manuel will need time to throw if he's going to have a chance at making big plays in the passing game.\nHow to follow the game The game will be broadcast on CBS , and syracuse.com will be running a live blog. You can also follow along with our coverage at the following Twitter accounts:\n@billsupdates\n@matthewfairburn\nWhat the Bengals are saying Of all quarterbacks, Dalton shouldn't be overwhelmed by Rex Ryan's defense. Last time he faced Ryan, Dalton lit up the Jets for 325 yards and five touchdowns in 2013. That, Dalton said, was a product of taking advantage of the aggressiveness of Ryan's defense.\n\"We had a chance to hit big plays, and we hit them,\" Dalton said. \"I think that's what it came down to, and guys made plays. So for us, that's what you've got to do whenever you get those opportunities, you've got to make them.\"\nWhat the Bills are saying Ryan remembers Dalton's five-touchdown performance against him two years ago, and he realizes the Bengals' quarterback is playing better than ever. He can't quite put his finger on what has made him better.\n\"I don't know because he tore it up against me. The last time we played him he killed us,\" Ryan said. \"So we better be better than what we were the last time we played against him, I can tell you that much. ... I know he's had some games that weren't very good or whatever. But that's every quarterback. But he's doing a great job. He throws the ball on time, he's a rhythm thrower and he's got a lot of good targets and he's accurate with the football. Obviously smart. He runs their show out there, so it's a big challenge. There's no doubt.\"\nPrediction The key stat for this game is that the Bengals are 24-3-1 in games against uncommon opponents with Dalton at quarterback. An uncommon opponent is one the Bengals didn't play the previous season. Both the Bills and Rex Ryan qualify. If that wasn't enough reason to be pessimistic about the Bills, they will also be starting a quarterback who hasn't seen the field in over a year. With all of the Bills' injuries, it's tough to see them pulling one out against a tough Cincinnati team.\nPick: Bengals 26, Bills 16\nOdds The Bengals are favored by 3 points , according to America's Line.\nWhat's next? The Bills play the Jacksonville Jaguars in London in Week 7.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/billsupdates", "https://twitter.com/MatthewFairburn"], "published": "2015-10-18T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:50:01.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
