The champagne was put back on ice.\nAfter a 2-1 loss to the wild-card-chasing Los Angeles Angels, when Mike Trout had a leadoff triple in the ninth and scored on Albert Pujols’ tiebreaking single, the Rangers needed a later loss by Houston for the division title.\n“Turn the page, come back tomorrow and be aggressive,” Andrus said before leaving the clubhouse. “(Saturday) is a great day to do it.”\nBy time the scheduled postgame fireworks show was over, after most of the Rangers players had already left the ballpark, Houston led 7-2 in the sixth inning and eventually won 21-5.\n  “We’ve got two games left and we’re going to continue to play hard,” Texas manager Jeff Banister said. “These guys have done a tremendous job of responding to situations like this.”\nAlready assured a playoff spot, Texas could have also clinched the division with a win over the Angels.\nLos Angeles began the day tied with Minnesota and a game behind Houston in the race for the second AL wild card. The Twins lost at home to AL Central champion Kansas City, dropping a game behind the Angels.\n“We’re worried about our house. We need to win,” Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.\nRangers closer Shawn Tolleson (6-4) appeared in his fourth consecutive game. Trout hit the second pitch deep into the right-center gap, then slid headfirst into third base before emphatically pumping his right arm toward his teammates in the dugout.\n“He did a good job of staying back and going the other way,” Tolleson said. “They asked me how I felt today and I told them I felt really good. And I did.”\nPujols followed with a soft single to left field on the next pitch.\n“Anytime Mike’s swinging the bat for us it’s important,” Sciosia said. “We need to get everybody swinging, but particularly Mike.”\nThe Angels have won eight of their past 10 games, but their 5-3 loss Thursday in the opener of the four-game series assured Texas a playoff spot.\nMike Morin (4-2), the fourth Angels pitcher, retired the only batter he faced when Adrian Beltre grounded out to end the eighth.\nJoe Smith worked a perfect ninth for his fourth save, including a strikeout of slugger Josh Hamilton, who was traded from Los Angeles back to Texas in April.\nShin-Soo Choo matched his career high with his 22nd homer leading off the Texas fourth to tie the game at 1.\nErick Aybar singled on the first pitch of the game, advancing on Pujols’ single before scoring on C.J. Cron’s hit for a 1-0 lead off Rangers left-hander Martin Perez.\nNotes • Chicago White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said he expects manager Robin Ventura to return next season. Hahn said bench coach Mark Parent’s contract will not be renewed and that assistant hitting coach Harold Baines has requested to move into an ambassador role. Ventura and the rest of the staff are expected back.\n• Atlanta Braves left-handed reliever Paco Rodriguez needs Tommy John surgery and will miss all of next season.\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:05:54.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
