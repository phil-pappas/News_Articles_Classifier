The mounting system is compatible with any smartphone, and the industrial strength enclosure will keep the phone and head protected during potential falls and crashes. “More action sports enthusiasts are wanting to document their experiences. We developed a hands-free system that allows people to easily capture their adventures (as well as family activities) using their existing smartphone,” said Igor Ondryas, Founder of TeamRider Xtreme.\n“With the new TRX Mounting System and your smartphone, you can turn any hat, helmet, or chest harness into an action sports camera that turns out high-quality videos that are easy to share with friends or upload to social media. And, the system costs a fraction of what other leading action sports cameras sell for.”\nMore Options, Instant Sharing\nMade for snow skiers, mountain bikers, snowboarders, skateboarders, and any action sports enthusiast, the TRX System gives users lots of options. They can instantly view, edit or share video to let people see the action right after it has been captured.\n“A common complaint that people have with current (small screen) action sports cameras is that they have to wait until they get back to a computer to share their videos with their friends and family,” said Ondryas. “The TRX System eliminates that delay and allows instant review and transmission.”\nAccessories for Capturing the Action\nBeyond the mounting system for your phone, TeamRider Xtreme also offers clip-on lens kits and remotes for both iPhones and Samsung cell phones. These accessories give users different options for the kind of video they are able to capture.\n“With our accessories, users can get a wide-angle or a fisheye look in their videos. It allows them create the style of video they want,” said Ondryas. “The TRX Mounting System is the most versatile and convenient way to capture video from the sportsman’s perspective.”\nAbout TeamRider Xtreme\nTeamRider Xtreme is an action sports Accessories Company dedicated to developing products that enhance the user experience.
