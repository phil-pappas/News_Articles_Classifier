(Photo: Rod Sanford/Lansing State Journal) Buy Photo \nANN ARBOR - Don’t bother flipping through the history books – there has never been a crazier finish in the Michigan State-Michigan rivalry than the one that just took place at Michigan Stadium. \nU-M punter Blake O’Neill lined up for a sealing punt with 10 seconds left and U-M up 23-21, but he fumbled the snap, took a hit and the ball went into the hands of MSU’s Jalen Watt-Jackson – who streaked all the way for the winning 38-yard touchdown on the final play of the game. \nA stadium full of U-M fans expecting to revel in a gigantic rivalry win instead had to watch as the Spartans celebrated wildly in the north end zone, then carried the Paul Bunyan Trophy to the other side to its throng of fans in green. \nSomehow, MSU has now won seven of eight games in this rivalry for the first time in history. And the No. 7 Spartans (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) remain alive for their Big Ten title and College Football Playoff pursuits. \nBefore that stunning play, MSU senior quarterback Connor Cook came up empty in his attempt to bring the Spartans back. His deep pass to an open Macgarrett Kings Jr. on fourth-and-19 hung up and was broken up by Michigan’s Dymonte Thomas to seemingly deliver a win for No. 12 U-M (5-2, 2-1). \nCook threw for 328 yards and a touchdown and Aaron Burbridge had 132 yards receiving, but the Michigan kicking game dominated MSU’s struggling special teams. Until one of the biggest special teams plays in MSU history.
