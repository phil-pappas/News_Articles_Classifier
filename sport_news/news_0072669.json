Buy this photo Zach Gewelb/Staff photographer Junior quarterback Zack Zaccone receives the snap and prepares to hand the ball off to senior running back Mark Riggio during Verona's 35-8 opening day win against Central in early September. \n\"So far we have been very pleased with Zack,\" Racioppe said. \"He has transitioned nicely into the QB role and is doing all the things we are asking of him.\" \nAs a Hillbilly, Ferrari played on both offense and defense and was one of the team's leaders. He was a dual-threat at the quarterback position because of his ability to both run and throw out of the backfield. Racioppe said Zaccone, who plays quarterback on offense and safety on defense, has done many of the same things on and off the field as Ferrari. \n\"Zack has run the ball exceptionally well when we have asked him to, and although we do not throw that often, he has also thrown some nice balls,\" Racioppe said. \"Zack has also become a leader on the fields and in the huddle ... We want our [quarterback] to be a leader but Zack seems to do it naturally. He is not the loudest guy on the field but players respect what he says and listen to him.\" \nOffensive coordinator Dan Corrado and defensive coordinator Mitch Roshong had nothing but good things to say about Zaccone and how he has progressed. \n\"The one thing about Zack is he knows everything that's going on at all times,\" Roshong said. \"He's very football-smart and he has kind of taken control and can position players where they need to be and tell them what they need to do. He's taken on the leadership role.\" \nCorrado echoed Roshong in saying that Zaccone's football smarts have helped guide the junior through the beginning of the season. \n\"I think Zack has done a great job,\" Roshong said. \"He's managed the offense well and has done a good job reading the defense.\" \nRacioppe said he sent his new quarterback a message at the beginning of the season to help ease the pressure that comes with replacing a player of Ferrari's caliber. \n\"Of course it is difficult to replace someone like Frank but we have always told Zack, 'You don't have to be Frank Ferrari you just need to be Zack Zaccone [and] we have confidence in you, as does the team. Concentrate on doing what you do well and we will be fine,'\" Racioppe said. \nZaccone has heeded Racioppe's message and said he has not felt any pressure this season. Of course, leading his team to a 4-0 start makes it much easier to adjust to life as a new starter. \n\"I think I've been able to replace Frank pretty well,\" Zaccone said. \"I'm basically just like him and do the same kind of stuff that he did.\" \nMuch like Ferrari, Zaccone has seen success both running and throwing the football this season. He has nine total touchdowns through Verona's first four games, including five through the air and four on the ground. His ability to run and throw the ball helps keeps defenses off balance. However, Zaccone gives much of the credit to his offensive line, which has given him strong run blocking and a good pocket to throw from. \n\"Our line is all back from last year and the reason why I've been able to run the ball well is because of them,\" Zaccone said. \"I've also been able to make some good reads and some good cuts.\" \nWhile Zaccone is pleased with how the offense has played so far - Verona has scored a combined 166 points so far this season - he noted that there is still room for improvement. \n\"We can work on passing the ball a little better,\" Zaccone said. \nHe likes to throw the ball more than he likes to run and said his go-to receivers have been Mike Stanisci and John DeMartinis. While he wants to throw the ball a little more often, Zaccone said Verona's early dominance has led to a more run-orientated approach. \nThe Hillbillies' strong play early in games has given them big leads to work with and Racioppe has often pulled the starters in an effort to keep them healthy and to give younger players a chance to gain some much-needed varsity experience. \n\"We've performed pretty well so far these first few games, Zaccone said. \"I'm happy that we've been winning by so much and that [the starters] able to get a little bit of rest.\" \nZaccone did say that it would be nice to see a little more playing time, but noted that he is \"happy the younger players have a chance to play.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:53:17.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
