And guys like Fergie Jenkins, Larry Walker, Justin Morneau and Joey Votto, Canadians with Cy Young Awards and MVP titles to their names, are a testament to the kind of talent Canada has produced over the years.\nOh, and Canada also upset the powerhouse U.S. team 8-6 in the World Baseball Classic in 2006.\nThe Internet immediately took Reynolds to task for his ignorant remark, including Walker himself.\nI won 7 gold gloves. I think part of winning them was cause I could catch. üòä\n‚Äî Larry Walker (@Cdnmooselips33) October 12, 2015\nSo Harold Reynolds said b/c a sport isn't a vital part of a particular nation's culture, its citizens don't really know the game? üê∏‚òïÔ∏è\n‚Äî Greg Wyshynski (@wyshynski) October 12, 2015\nEH GUYS We should pull our Goalie and get an extra batter next inning !!!! #HaroldReynolds\n‚Äî Paul W Bromby (@PaulBromby) October 12, 2015\nI drop one foul ball in the camera bay and now Harold Reynolds thinks everyone from Canada is as bad as me.\n‚Äî Barry Davis (@SNBarryDavis) October 12, 2015\nI grew up in Canada and I don't have a TV in my igloo to watch the \"baseball \" what is the score ? #HaroldReynolds\n‚Äî Paul W Bromby (@PaulBromby) October 12, 2015\nDear @FS1 , please ask #HaroldReynolds to explain how baseball works to Canadians-you know, the country where #BabeRuth got his 1st home run\n‚Äî Kevin Frankish (@KevinFrankish) October 12, 2015\nGood thing no one tried to tell him tomorrow is Thanksgiving in Canada.
