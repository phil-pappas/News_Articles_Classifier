However, after the purchase, when the packages were delivered to me, I found that the retailer had charged me more than the MRP marked on it. In fact, he had taken from me, the cost of the mobile phone. Upset, I asked the retailer to either take back the goods and return my money or refund the excess amount charged. He is not doing either. What do I do? First and foremost, by selling above the Maximum Retail Price marked on the package, the retailer has violated the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, which prohibit the sale of goods at a price above the MRP. Second, he has indulged in an unfair trade practice — he told you that the mobile phone is free, but he has actually recovered the cost of the phone by overcharging on the products. In fact, when you purchase electronic goods, you can well bargain and buy them at a price well below the MRP. So in the guise of offering you a free gift, he has actually overcharged you. He has to take back the goods and return your money, if you so wish, or refund the excess amount charged from you. And he has to compensate you for the harassment caused to you as a result of his actions and also his refusal to make amends, even when you gave him a chance. Send him an ultimatum (in writing) and if he fails to redress your complaint, seek the help of the consumer court. Are there any consumer court orders to help me in this? In a number of cases, the consumer courts have taken a stern view of such unfair promotions. But let me Quote: the latest — Godrej and Boyce Mfg Co Ltd Vs Anagha Vilas Kulkarni (, RP No 1954 of 2015), decided on August 21, 2015. The case is more or less similar to yours – in this case too, the complainant, Anagha Kulkarni, bought in 2010, a washing machine and a refrigerator for a total cost of Rs 22,841 under a ‘scheme’ offered by the manufacturer, as per which she was to get a pair of silver watches free of cost on the purchase. Here, too, when the goods were delivered, she realised that she had been charged Rs 2,695 more than the MRP on both the products. However, since the manufacturer did not resolve her complaint, she was forced to seek the help of the Raigarh District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which directed the company to refund the excess amount of Rs 5,390 and also pay Rs 18,772 towards compensation and costs. The company, however, appealed against this order before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission as well as the National Commission and its main contention was that the case was time-barred. The Consumer Protection Act puts a time-limit on filing complaints, which is two years calculated from the date of the cause of action. The company’s contention was that the cause of action arose when the package was opened on May 8, 2010 and the consumer discovered that she had been over charged. So the complaint, filed on August 30, 2012, was barred by limitation under Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act.. Both the Commissions at the state as well as the national level disagreed and said the limitation period was to be calculated from the time the company promised to act on the consumer’s complaint through a letter on September 1, 2010 (but eventually did not). However, while the State Commission dismissed the appeal filed by the company, the National Commission took note of the facts and circumstances of the case and asked the company to pay punitive damages of Rs 1 lakh to the Consumer legal Cell of the National Commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:03:33.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
