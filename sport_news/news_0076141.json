We were forcing their defensemen and I just got lucky and was in the right spot at the right time.\" \nKnoxville (2-0) started the season Friday with a 5-4 shootout victory at Macon. \nBefore Saturday's game, the Ice Bears' 2015 SPHL championship banner was unveiled from the rafters, and players were introduced. \nTeam captain Jason Price skated on the ice last, carrying the President's Cup awarded each year to the SPHL champion. \nAll of it was a motivator for Reid, an Ontario native who played at the University of Alabama-Huntsville. \n\"Obviously following up a championship team, you have big expectations, but it psyches you up before the game,\" Reid said of the banner dropping. \"You get chills when the banner drops, and it kind of gave me an extra bump today, I guess. I think it helped out. I love it.\" \nReid began the preseason at Evansville (Ind.) of the East Coast Hockey League and joined the Ice Bears when he was released. \nKnoxville coach Mike Craigen has watched Reid the past couple of years while he played for Alabama-Huntsville, which plays some home games before the Huntsville Havoc's SPHL games. \n\"He's immediately the kind of Ice Bear player we've had over the years,\" Craigen said. \"He wants to win more than anything else. He'd trade that hat trick in any day just to make sure we get a win. He's a great character guy.\" \nBryan Hince started in goal for the second consecutive night. \nColumbus (0-1-1) started Joel Danyluk, a first-year SPHL goalie. Andrew Loewen, the Cottonmouths' No. 1 goalie for five seasons, retired last spring. \nKnoxville took a 1-0 lead 42 seconds into the first period when Dennis Sicard knocked in a shot after a center by Price. \nLouis Belisle's goal at 1:09 of the second tied it. \nReid made it 2-1 with 3:03 left in the second when he scored in a scrum in front of Danyluk. \nTyler Henry tied it 2-2 at 2:01 of the third. \nReid had the go-ahead goal at 9:18 when he redirected a shot by Bo Driscoll past Danyluk. He scored an empty-net goal with 1:09 to play. \n\"We like to recruit leaders, and Doug's a big leader for us whether or not he's played two games of pro or 10 games of pro,\" Craigen said. \"He's going to be a big leader for us and I think you saw what kind of player he is tonight.\" \nKnoxville has one game next weekend, at Fayetteville on Friday.
