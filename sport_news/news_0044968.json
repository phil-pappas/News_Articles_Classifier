Looking back at that, there's so many similarities in what they're doing. Fun for the challenge, but they're awfully good.\"\nThe departure of MSU defensive coordinator Pat Narduzzi is looked at as a possible reason for the slippage, but head coach Mark Dantonio still is at the head of it.\n\"It seems like he's kept the system the same the same when coach Narduzzi left,\" Fisch said. \"Very similar in what the do. They're a quarters team, mix in some other coverages. ... They're very good at what they do. They have an identity. They've won a lot of games with that defense, and a lot of teams have tried to replicate that defense.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nCalhoun: Defense wasn't playing like Spartan dawgs\nThe Spartans will be prepared for almost anything Michigan can throw their way, Fisch said, which makes this a fascinating matchup. U-M offensive coaches are gaining a reputation for flooding opponents with many formations and looks.\nAfter sending first-round cornerbacks to the NFL the past two years, the strength of the Spartans is up front -- an area that has damaged the Wolverines in their recent matchups. But the Michigan offensive line has proved itself a few times already.\n\"I don't know if it's the best or not the best but I think we've gone against some really, really good ones,\" Fisch said of defensive fronts. \"Utah's defensive line was really good. Last week, (Northwestern), they've created a lot of challenges for a lot of teams. I thought Maryland had a really good defensive line. This is a good football team we're playing, and it's going to be a great challenge for our guys.\"\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
