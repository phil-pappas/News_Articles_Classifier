But I had little interest in trying to resurrect a movement that has proven ineffective when it comes to addressing black-on-black violence.\nWhile the theme for the historic gathering, “Justice or Else,” strikes the right tone given the number of controversial police-involved shootings, the demand fails to capture a black family’s most pressing concern: the daily violence that is threatening their future.\nPolice-involved murders are negligible compared with the thousands of black men, women and children who have been gunned down by black men since the 1995 march.\nYet, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan is asking black men to come to the nation’s capital to demand justice for a host of ills directed at African-Americans.\nOPINION\nFollow @MaryMitchellCST\nAlthough the headquarters for the Nation of Islam is in Chicago, Farrakhan has been reluctant to give interviews to reporters at white-owned media and has not granted my requests for an interview.\nI also reached out to Ishmael Muhammad, a son of Elijah Muhammad and Farrakhan’s assistant, to no avail.\nBut in June, Farrakhan told a gathering at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington “these are not the times for weak people, for cowardly people,” the Washington Post reported.\nThe Rev. Jamal Bryant, one of the march’s organizers and an activist pastor in Baltimore, said the gathering would issue an ultimatum.\n“We are no longer looking for symbolic victory. We are looking for substance,” the Post reported.\nWhile there is justifiable tension around police shootings, there is a growing frustration around black-on-black violence.\nWe saw that frustration boil over this week when African-American aldermen called for the firing of Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy.\nTio Hardiman, the former president of Cease Fire Illinois who now heads up Violence Interrupters NFP, said he hopes to catch a late flight to Washington on Friday night.\n“I am hoping the minister will address black-on-black violence because he has the reach to unify African-American people,” he said.\n“It is incumbent upon black men to stop the killing in the black community,” Hardiman said.\nThere’s no question Chicago has had its share of controversial police-involved shootings or that mass incarceration has destroyed black families and black communities. But 80 percent of the shootings in Chicago take place in predominantly African-American neighborhoods.\nWe have to find ways to change the hearts and minds of young men who do not value their own lives or the lives of others.\nKim Dulaney, an African-American Studies professor at Chicago State University, tried to take a busload of gang members to the anniversary march, hoping they would be persuaded to leave the violence behind.\n“A lot of street guys were interested in going, but we weren’t able to make that happen. I think people are not as hopeful as they were the first time. People just don’t know what can help,” Dulaney said.\nUnfortunately, it was too late to assemble a team of men to help supervise the young men during the trip.\nStill, Hardiman said he believes if anyone can bring peace to the black community, it would be Farrakhan.\nIf that’s the case, the anniversary march should have been in Chicago.\nBecause this is a situation where charity truly begins at home.\nFollow @MaryMitchellCST\nTweets by @MaryMitchellCST", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MaryMitchellCST"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:12:32.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
