Clifton defeated Lakeland. Kelly Redl refused to take another shootout penalty kick.\nEver.\nThe former Ramsey soccer player was just a ninth-grader playing in a freshman game when her attempt was denied by an opposing goalkeeper in a loss. The pain stung so severely that it made a lasting impact on the rest of her high school career.\nRedl, a 2014 graduate and All-Bergen County caliber defender, would not even practice penalty kicks again until her senior season.\n“And I still wouldn’t make them,” she said, laughing. “I don’t know if it was that I couldn’t handle the pressure, but if I missed, I’d probably lose it and go crazy.”\nStanding one-on-one against a focused goalkeeper who is staring her down from 12 yards away was something Redl wanted no part of ever again. And she’s not alone. It’s a mindset shared by several current North Jersey stars, according to area coaches, especially when a game – and maybe even a season – is at stake.\nThere’s just something about penalty kicks that make even the most talented of players unable to get past the mental roadblock.\n“Oh, I don’t like them at all,” said Mahwah junior Sarah Jordan, who stays away from PKs despite being one of North Jersey’s top facilitating playmakers with nine goals and 14 assists. “I think I’d just be too hard on myself and blame myself too much if I didn’t come through. I don’t want to let the team down.”\nSome penalty kicks have storybook endings. Others have nightmarish finishes. That is the stark reality of these pressure-packed shootouts.\nShooter vs. goalie. One wins. One loses. And everyone else watches intently.\nNot wanting to place responsibility on any one player for a loss is partially why the Bergen and Passaic County championship soccer games – and the state finals – don’t go to penalty kicks.\n“If two teams are tied at the end of 100 minutes, do you really want to determine a winner by PKs?” said Paul Heenehan, the Ramapo coach and Bergen County tournament director. “There is no need due to a team [not needing] to move on.”\nSo both counties and the NJSIAA award co-champions, which often leaves both teams with mixed emotions and no closure.\nBut all the rounds leading up to the championships in the aforementioned tournaments do need advancement. So, they settle knotted games with drama-filled shootouts.\nNo one seems to like them, especially after losing one. And the winner in penalty kicks is not always indicative of the better team. But it is the only plausible solution right now, officials say.\n“The way it is now is not totally satisfactory,” said Ramsey coach George Wright, whose program was on both ends of penalty kicks in 2013, winning a sectional title at Pascack Hills in a shootout then losing in the same fashion five days later in the Group 2 semifinals. “No one really likes ending games in shootouts.\n“But no one really has any other alternative.”\nRidgewood, Paramus, Paramus Catholic and Clifton all have won county tournament shootouts this season. The Maroons and Mustangs still are vying for their respective county titles.\nMost believe the kicks themselves pose more of a mental challenge than a physical one. Differing from the usual pace of play in soccer, shootouts allow its participants significantly more time to ponder the consequences of failure.\nThere’s the long walk to the spot of the kick. The placement of the ball on the line. The staredown with the goalie. The wait for the whistle to blow.\n“I don’t think I could handle being the reason we lost a game in PKs,” said Redl, now playing club soccer at Rutgers. “I over-thought them. A lot of it was just in my head.”\nSome of the best athletes in the world have missed penalty kicks on far greater stages. But it’s not uncommon now for some of North Jersey’s best players to shy away from them.\n“I’ve had some great players in the past that I’d look out to when a PK situation comes up and they just go, ‘No, I don’t want it,’ “ Ridgewood coach Jeff Yearing said. “You’re not going to put a kid like that at the line.”\nShootouts often change the course of teams’ seasons – for better or worse – in pivotal county and state tournament matches, only adding to the emotions behind each kick.\n“I hate them,” said a laughing Mahwah coach Courtney Carrelha, whose team has been on the wrong end of three postseason shootouts the past two years, including one in this year’s BCT round of 16 against Ridgewood. “It really is so mental. You have to be confident and step up and be ready to own it.\n“If you don’t have that mentality, then you’ve missed before you even step to the line. It might look easy being so close, but when you factor in nerves and the pressure of the situation, it changes the recipe.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:37:14.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
