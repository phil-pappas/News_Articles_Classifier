Still, he said he was going to give it his best.\n\"I'm just happy to be able to bring the series back home to Kansas City and I'll be ready tomorrow to pitch and perform for my club,\" he said.\nCan he handle the pressure of the moment? He said he was happy to have the opportunity to pitch the Royals into the World Series.\n\"Whatever God wants to happen tomorrow is going to happen. I'll be ready,\" he said. \"I'm focused on my stuff and how I'm feeling tomorrow and what I'm going to be able to feature tomorrow. I'm not too focused on what they bring to the table.  I'm concerned about how I'm going to feel.\"\nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons said he hopes that the Blue Jays bats can do as well against Ventura as they did in Game 2.\n\"He's got an overpowering arm. If he's on, I sound like a broken record, when he's on, when you've got that kind of arm it's going to be a tough go,\" he said. \"He really lets them fly. Hopefully if he's a little bit wild we take advantage of that. But he's one of those guys, he's there attacking, there's no finesse to him. But I liked our bats against him the other day, hopefully we can do that again.\"\nRoyals manager Ned Yost feels good about Ventura's performance.\n\"He keeps us in the game. But in these types of games you feel good with him going, even though he's a young guy,\" he said. \"He's got a lot of confidence in his abilities. He's got a lot of confidence in his stuff. And you know the moment is not going to overwhelm him.\"\nHe said the key will be Ventura's command on his curveball and changeup.\nCan Ventura, who won Game 6 of last year's World Series, again handle the pressure of the moment or will he crumble? He said he was happy to have the opportunity to pitch the Royals into the World Series.\n\"Whatever God wants to happen tomorrow is going to happen. I'll be ready,\" he said. \"I'm focused on my stuff and how I'm feeling tomorrow and what I'm going to be able to feature tomorrow. I'm not too focused on what they bring to the table.  I'm concerned about how I'm going to feel.\"\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
