Native Americans already had been in the Americas centuries before Columbus landed.\nThe arrival of Europeans in North and South America led to an era of colonization, with Europeans forcibly removing Native Americans from their lands.\nThe state of South Dakota instead recognizes Native American Day as a legal holiday, stating \"Native Americans Day is dedicated to the remembrance of the great Native American leaders who contributed so much to the history of our state.\"\nHawaii recognizes Discoverers Day, which pays tribute to the original Polynesian discoverers of Hawaii, though it's not an official holiday.\nIn 2014, major U.S. cities Seattle and Minneapolis opted to recognize Indigenous Peoples Day instead of Columbus Day.\nIn its resolution, the city of Seattle stated that \"the Commission recognizes that the celebration of Christopher Columbus and his alleged 1492 discovery of the lands that would later become known as the Americas works to celebrate an era of colonization and dispossession of indigenous peoplesâ€™ homelands, as well as the decimation of entire groups of indigenous peoples from North and South America.\"\n Portland , Albuquerque, NM , and Traverse City, MI , are among the cities celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day this year.\nStates also have opted to ignore the Columbus holiday. Only 23 states and the District of Columbia give state employees paid time off on this day, the Pew Research Center stated.\nA delegation of Native nations first proposed Indigenous Peoples Day in 1977 at a United Nations-sponsored International Conference on Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations in the Americas.\nBerkeley, CA, began celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day in 1992, the 500th anniversary of Columbus' landing.\nBut some Italian-Americans have begun pushing back against the Columbus Day pushback, regarding the holiday as a celebration of their culture.\nThe Order Sons of Italy in America, in a statement , considers Columbus Day the only Italian-American heritage holiday and a patriotic holiday.\nThe group chose to focus instead on all the good the European migration has brought, including \"Greek democracy, Roman law, Judeo-Christian ethics and the tenet that all men are created equal.\"\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
