A floral art installation in an abandoned two-story duplex outside of Detroit Oct. 16-18 may prove that greenery can transform.\nVolunteers creating the temporary Flower House hope to change outsiders' perceptions of Detroit, attitudes about unloved buildings and most important, that buying local doesn't exclude flowers.\nAmerican-grown flower producers need your support, says florist Lisa Waud of Pot & Box , who conceived of the installation in a dilapidated dwelling destined to be razed in Hamtramck, Michigan.\nOnce, U.S. farms produced nearly 65 percent of the nation's cut flowers , but over the past two decades, imports have caused that figure to shrink to single digits, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture reports.\nIndustrialized cut flower farms in the Netherlands, Colombia and Ecuador fly or ship pallets of flowers every day, creating a transportation footprint that buy-local supporters say overshadows the environmental costs to heat U.S. greenhouses and send the perishable product to stores.\nCut flowers reap big bucks: Retails sales in the U.S. are about $8 billion a year , according to the Society of American Florist. But American-grown cut stems are a fraction of this.\nAt the Flower House, however, every petal, stem, foliage, vine, bud, berry and greenery totaling about 40,000 pieces was grown in the U.S.\nAmerican-grown blooms and living plants vine up pounded walls, cluster on pitted floors, hang from peeling ceilings.\nOrnamental vegetables are carefully assembled in kitchen drawers, on tables levitated by legs made of thick tree branches and in every crevice created by time and use in a creaky old house.\nMums overtake the closet and adorn the bathroom. Other stems drape across windows instead of curtains. They patch holes in the walls and piles of lavender fill decaying balconies.\nSoftly unfolding, garden-grown roses and upright carnivorous stalks from greenhouses grow from mossy mounds in the center of what once was a living room.\nA towering, tornado-shaped arrangement of ferns, berries and branches dominates one of the rooms. In a bedroom, a mattress made of moss and a pillow of dahlias lie between the four-poster bed formed by small trees.\nTulips dangle from the bottom of stair treads and irises are stapled to stairway walls. Lilies and ivy spill out from window sills onto crumbling siding. White gladiolas reach toward the crooked front door.\nIt's a mash up: Orchids, protea and birds-of-paradise share space with peppers, persimmons and turnips.\nWaud bought the dire duplex and the boarded-up house next door at auction. She paid $500 for both.\nBefore moving to Michigan, she worked at the Portland Nursery and attended college in Washington, making her a self-proclaimed \"proud Pacific Northwesterner.\"\nWith this event, she was assisted by a passel of florists, including Susan McLeary, the owner of Passionflower in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who converted a kitchen into a bounty of cauliflower and other florets.\nMcLeary was trained by floral designer Francoise Weeks of Portland, who flew in to cheer on her former student. \"I'm delighted to be part of this event,\" says Weeks.\nAbout 2,000 people are expected to tour Flower House Friday through Sunday. Others kept arriving Thursday, hoping to get long-sold-out tour tickets. Even a police officer rolled up in his squad car and asked about tickets.\nAll of this pleases Waud, her team and the people promoting American-grown flowers.\nThe California Cut Flower Commission , Mayesh and other fresh-cut flower wholesalers donated flowers.\nAlso helping is Debra Prinzing , a Seattle author and founder of Slowflowers.com , a directory to 600 florists, event planners, supermarket flower departments and flower farmers with domestic-grown flowers and foliage.\nGrowers such as wholesaler Oregon Flowers , with 40 acres of field blooms and hops, and almost eight acres of greenhouses in Aurora, and dozens of others across the state are listed in the directory.\nOn Thursday afternoon, Oct. 15, Prinzing was helping Waud arrange buckets of fresh-cut flowers to be installed. Weeks ago, Prinzing interviewed Waud in a Slow Flowers podcast , which showered international attention on Flower House.\nOn Friday, Oct. 16, the last of a series of Field to Vase dinners , where the centerpieces are as fresh, sustainable and local as the multicourse farm-fresh feast, will take place at a tent alongside Flower House.\nThe dinners are organized by the volunteer coalition of American Grown Flowers to celebrate flower growers in the way farm-to-table and winemakers dinners put the spotlight on local producers. Past Field to Vase dinners were held in flower farms in Oregon, Washington, California and other states.\n-- Janet Eastman\njeastman@oregonian.com\n503-799-8739\n@janeteastman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/janeteastman", "http://portlandnursery.com/", "http://www.mayesh.com/", "http://www.americangrownflowers.org/fieldtovase/", "http://www.debraprinzing.com/2015/02/18/the-flowering-of-detroit-with-lisa-waud-of-pot-box-episode-181/", "http://www.theflower.house/", "http://www.passionflowerevents.com/", "http://safnow.org/trends-statistics/floral-industry-facts/", "http://www.debraprinzing.com/", "http://www.ccfc.org/", "http://potandbox.com/", "http://www.americangrownflowers.org/", "http://potandbox.com/about/"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:06:09.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
