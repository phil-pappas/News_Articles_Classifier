The bags under his eyelids. The responses, thoughtful as always, but harder to find.\n&raquo Box score\nAfter one question in particular, regarding why the Syracuse defense couldn't get a stop against Virginia from the fourth quarter on, Franklin paused, then meandered from play to play before settling on a conclusion.\n\"\"I don't know,\" Franklin said. \"I really can't explain it. I feel like I can't really tell you where it's at. We've just got to execute better. In that situation, we've got to win the game.\"\nSyracuse football player's post-game press conference : 10/17/15 - Virginia - Julian Whigham Syracuse University defensive back Julian Whigham talked to the press after their tough 44-38 triple overtime loss to Virginia in Charlottesville on Saturday October 17th 2015. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com\nThe Cavaliers erased a 24-14 deficit with 15- and 19-play scoring drives in the final frame of SU's 44-38 triple-overtime loss on Saturday. After forcing two critical second-quarter turnovers, the Orange defense allowed five third-down conversions, one on a Ron Thompson face mask, and one fourth-down conversion before giving up three touchdowns in overtime.\nA unit that was once the backbone of the program has allowed 400 yards of total offense in three straight games and 89 points combined to South Florida and UVA.\n\"As much as this sucks, we have to move forward because we have no other choice,\" Franklin said. \"All our goals are still attainable. At the end of the day, everything we want to do we can still do — including win the Atlantic (Division) — whether people will believe it or not.\"\nThe lack of experience throughout the defense has created more missed assignments and penalties this season, but tackling has been especially inconsistent in the last two weeks.\nThe Orange drilled in hard after a 45-24 loss to the Bulls last Saturday, but defensive coordinator Chuck Bullough watched his unit regress in the second half against the Cavaliers.\n\"That's what we've got to figure out, if guys are getting tired or what it is,\" Bullough said. \"We just didn't tackle well in the second half.\"\nThe later the game went, the more the defense wore down.\nSenior corner Julian Whigham and freshman safety Kielan Whitner got beat over the top in overtime as UVA quarterback Matt Johns threw a 36-yard scoring strike to Canaan Severin,\nThen, after SU kicker Cole Murphy missed a 48-yard field goal, the Orange front seven gave up a goal-line score to Jordan Ellis.\nWith a Pittsburgh team that posted 41 points against Georgia Tech coming to the Carrier Dome next Saturday, the Syracuse defense will need to improve for the team to snap its three-game skid.\nContact Stephen Bailey anytime: Email | Twitter", "external_links":
