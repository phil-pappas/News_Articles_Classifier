Walker was the '82 Heisman winner and the only college player ever to finish in the top three of the Heisman voting three straight years. His career rushing average was a ridiculous 159.4 yards per game.\nThen there's Jackson, maybe the league's best-ever athlete and the only person ever to be named an all-star in two major pro sports (baseball was the other). At 6-1, 230 pounds, he won the 1985 Heisman when he averaged 162.4 rushing yards per game. He still holds the SEC career record for yards per carry at 6.62 set from 1982-85.\nSomebody Spurrier forgot to mention – maybe it was because this guy tied the SEC individual game rushing record with 321 yards against Spurrier's Gamecocks in 2007 – is Arkansas' Darren McFadden.\nThe 6-1, 215-pound McFadden, the SEC's second all-time leading rusher, was Heisman runner-up in 2006 and 2007, and won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's best running back both years.\nLSU never faced Walker or Jackson, but McFadden averaged 148.3 yards, scored six TDs and threw for another in three appearances against the Tigers. No LSU fan will forget his 206 yards and three TDs in the Hogs' 50-48 triple overtime season-finale victory over No. 1 LSU in '07 that almost, should have, but didn't, derail the Tigers' national title hopes.\nThe best Herschel outside the state of Georgia\nWalker, Jackson and McFadden are the ghosts that Fournette is chasing. According to the men who coached the three players who are on the SEC's Mount Rushmore of running backs, the LSU sophomore has held his own so far.\n\"There's no question Herschel comes to mind when you look at Fournette, with his size, his incredible strength and running over people,\" said former Georgia coach Vince Dooley, whose team won three straight SEC titles and the 1980 national championship in Walker's freshman season. \"We've got a guy here in (Georgia running back Nick) Chubb who's more like Herschel than anybody I've seen at Georgia since Herschel played.\n\"He and Fournette aren't as fast as Herschel. I don't think anybody can beat Herschel's speed, but Fournette is more physical than Chubb. Fournette is the closest thing I've seen to Herschel outside of Georgia.\n\"You've still got the test of time to prove you can be like Herschel. Herschel did it for three years, so we'll see about Fournette. What Herschel did as a freshman Fournette is doing now as a sophomore.\"\nLike Fournette, Walker operated almost exclusively from the I-formation. The fact Walker averaged 30.1 carries per game in his 33-game college career is testimony to his endurance, and Dooley's willingness to put the team on Walker's back.\n\"Our offense just dictated that, and Herschel wanted the ball,\" Dooley said. \"LSU is the same way (with Fournette). That's an offense where the running back gets the football. LSU does it so well and that's what we did so well.\"\nDooley said even though Walker got stronger as games progressed, he never left him in games longer than required to obtain victory.\n\"When it was obvious the game was won, I didn't use him,\" Dooley said. \"That's the time to show some common sense of protecting him from injury.\"\nFournette's fast enough\nDye said Fournette isn't as fast as Jackson or Walker, but \"he's fast enough.\"\n\"As far as being physical, running ability and being a good teammate, Fournette has all the things you look for in a running back,\" Dye said. \"When he played us (Auburn) a few weeks ago (when Fournette ran for 228 yards and three TDs on 19 carries), I don't know if we were intimidated or what the circumstances were. But he made us look like school children. It was hard to take.\n\"But when LSU plays Alabama (on Nov. 7 in Tuscaloosa), Alabama will do everything to stop him. Alabama is going to make the quarterback (Brandon Harris) beat them.\"\nDye said he never had to worry about managing Jackson's workload. Auburn ran a Wishbone offense, so Jackson was one of the options and not the whole show like Walker. He had substantially fewer carries than Walker.\n\"The way LSU's coaches use Fournette is perfect,\" Dye said. \"They are going to do what's best for the team and what's best for the kid. They are keeping him fresh and that's a good thing. If he got tired, he'd be a lot more susceptible to getting hurt.\"\nNutt, who works for CBS Sports, said Fournette's breakout game against Auburn was a head-turner.\n\"Auburn was really the game that made me say, 'Oh my goodness!,'\" Nutt said. \"They're trying to tackle him high, they're trying to tackle him low. Unless you just true, true form gang tackle this guy, he's a load to bring down.\n\"He's such a beast. In between the tackles, anybody is going to get tired of tackling him.\"\nNutt has kept an eye on Fournette ever since he stepped on LSU's campus a year ago, and said his improvement is noticeable.\n\"I've seen him get better and better and better,\" Nutt said. \"This year, especially, you can see he has more confidence and patience. He has extraordinary vision. When he hits the hole, he hits it. He presses the heels of his linemen.\"\nCan't predict number of carries each game\nArkansas led the SEC in rushing all three years McFadden played for Nutt. But he had help from Felix Jones and Peyton Hillis, who were also drafted by the NFL. Like McFadden who was the No. 4 pick overall by the Raiders, Jones was chosen later in the first round No. 22 overall by the Cowboys.\n\"We went into games thinking we'd get the ball to Darren 15 to 20 times, Felix 10 to 15 and Peyton about 10,\" Nutt said. \"But the toughest thing for coaches is putting a number on how many carries a guy should get, because you don't really know until how the game will play out.\n\"There were some games you knew beforehand you were going to win, when you knew you'd like to get Darren out when the game was in hand. You want to save the tread on the tires.\n\"But the original plan is always to win the game, first and foremost. Whatever it took. If it's 30 carries, we're going to give it to Darren 30. If it's 20, we're going to give to him 20. If he's our guy that's going to get it done, then we're going to do it.\"\nThe one thing Dooley, Dye and Nutt agree on is Fournette's high character as a team player, a leader and a good teammate put in him the Walker-Jackson-McFadden category.\n\"I've heard some really good things (being a team player and a leader) about him,\" Dooley said. \"They (LSU) have got a jewel in that guy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:58:34.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
