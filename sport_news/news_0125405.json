(Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) When Jimmy Pruitt went home to San Diego last Christmas and again in the summer, he had to endure the usual abuse from friends about San Jose State's 38-7 season-ending loss to San Diego State. \nIt wasn't exactly trash talk. \n\"It was all non-verbal. Just facial expressions,\" Pruitt said. \"They carried themselves a little different around me. It was all joking.\" \n\"It's OK,\" the Spartans' senior cornerback told them at the time. \"We'll be back. We're going to see you guys this year.\" \nThe rematch is Saturday night at Spartan Stadium. With first place in the West Division of the Mountain West Conference on the line, Pruitt is eager to deliver a better performance against his hometown school. \nThe Aztecs gave him a little recruiting attention when he was at Helix High, but Pruitt said his intention always was to attend college elsewhere. \"I wanted to get away from home, to explore,\" he said. \nStill, Pruitt is proud of his hometown and, especially, his high school alma mater. \n\"When you go there, Reggie Bush, Alex Smith, Bill Walton, they're everywhere,\" he said of fellow Helix alums. \"You can just feel the atmosphere, you can feel the rich heritage that's there.\" \nBut for the past two years, the Spartans have lost to the Aztecs and this is Pruitt's last shot at them. \n\"Especially with us going down there last year and having that outcome, it wasn't really what we wanted,' said Pruitt, who has eight career interceptions. \"This year we're going in with a chip on our shoulder.\" Advertisement \nAnd so the game is just a little bigger for Pruitt because the opponent is from San Diego? \n\"A lot . . . a lot . . . a lot,\" he said, emphasizing the word a bit more each time. \"This is going to be a fun game. We're definitely ready.\" For more San Jose State coverage, visit the SpartanCentral blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/sjsu .
