Yep, the Admirals have had an extra week to prepare for Campbell County's Josh Lay, who has led the Cougars to four straight wins and put up video game-like numbers since being inserted as starting quarterback. Farragut will counter with a stout defense, led by Chattanooga commitment Cole Strange (64 tackles, 12 TFL, four sacks), that's allowing only 9.2 points per game this season. Admirals running back Tanner Thomas needs 192 yards to top 1,000 this season. Both should make an impact on Friday with the top spot in Region 3-5A on the line.\nPrepXtra Pick: Farragut 35, Campbell County 21\nGibbs (3-3, 1-1 Region 2-5A) at Halls (2-3, 1-1): The rivalry doesn't get the same praise as others in the area, but its one of the most passionate, regardless if Gibbs and Halls play every year. And there's plenty at stake on Friday, particularly a step toward the playoffs. Halls, which last advanced to the postseason in 2007, is convinced the turnover woes that plagued it early this season have been exorcised. The Red Devils have won consecutive games, albeit against winless South-Doyle and Union County, and received a boost from an improving offensive line. Gibbs has lost consecutive games, but has won the past two in the series against Halls. Keep an eye on speedy Gibbs slotback Desanta Smith.\nPrepXtra Pick: Gibbs 31, Halls 24\nMorristown West (5-1, 2-0 Region 1-5A) vs. Morristown East (0-5, 0-2): I know how this matchup looks on paper. I also know that few rivalries carry this much clout in their communities. Morristown West, ranked No. 2 in Class 5A, is technically the home team, though both teams call Burke-Toney Stadium \"home.\" The Trojans have won five consecutive games since losing a heartbreaker to Fulton in Week 1. Morristown East, meanwhile, has shown its potential in spurts this season, though its record has been muddied by a bevy of injuries and a brutal schedule. Morristown West, which has won 16 of the past 19, represents the final leg of the tough stretch, and nothing would jump start the Hurricanes' late playoff run like upsetting its biggest rival on Friday. East is as healthy as it has been since Week 1, but West, led by running back DeAndre Delaney, still might be too big an obstacle.\nPrepXtra Pick: Morristown West 35, Morristown East 24\nCatholic (2-4, 0-2 Region 2-4A) at Anderson County (3-3,1-1): It's crunch time for Catholic's football team. The Irish need to win two of their final three region games to advance to the postseason. Anderson County, which rallied to stun rival Clinton last week, presents the first test, and has a running game, led by sophomore Mason Phillips, capable of giving any defense problems. Still, Catholic showed flashes of its potential in a Week 5 loss to Fulton, the first game back for standout Irish receiver Chase Kuerschen. Expect quarterback Chase Cunningham to find him and Southern California commitment Amari Rodgers often on Friday.\nPrepXtra Pick: Catholic 42, Anderson County 31\nBradley Central over Bearden\nDavid Crockett over Cocke County\nHancock County over Concord Christian\nSevier County over Daniel Boone\nPigeon Forge over Elizabethton\nGreeneville over Grainger\nScience Hill over Hardin Valley\nClaiborne over Johnson County\nGatlinburg-Pittman over North Greene\nNorthview Academy over West Greene\nSeymour over Cherokee\nCosby over South Greene\nSullivan North over Cumberland Gap\nAlcoa over McMinn Central\nCAK over Loudon\nFulton over Carter\nCoalfield over Harriman\nKingston over Scott\nMidway over Jellico\nAustin-East over Oliver Springs\nOneida over Sunbright\nHeritage over Powell\nWest over South-Doyle\nCentral over Union County\nTellico Plains over Wartburg\nOak Ridge over Karns\nClinton over Lenoir City\nMcMinn County over White County\nWebb over Donelson Christian\nThe King's Academy over Lancaster Christian\nSaturday\nTSD over Missouri School for the Deaf\nNick Carboni's Picks\nBradley Central over Bearden\nDavid Crockett over Cocke County\nHancock County over Concord Christian\nSevier County over Daniel Boone\nPigeon Forge over Elizabethton\nGreeneville over Grainger\nScience Hill over Hardin Valley\nClaiborne over Johnson County\nMorristown West at Morristown East\nGatlinburg-Pittman over North Greene\nNorthview Academy over West Greene\nCherokee over Seymour\nCosby over South Greene\nSullivan North over Cumberland Gap\nAlcoa over McMinn Central\nCatholic over Anderson County\nCAK over Loudon\nFulton over Carter\nCoalfield over Harriman\nKingston over Scott\nGibbs over Halls\nMidway over Jellico\nAustin-East over Oliver Springs\nOneida over Sunbright\nHeritage over Powell\nWest over South-Doyle\nCentral over Union County\nWartburg over Tellico Plains\nCampbell County over Farragut\nOak Ridge over Karns\nLenoir City over Clinton\nWhite County over McMinn County\nWebb over Donelson Christian, 8 p.m.\nThe King's Academy over Lancaster Christian\nSaturday\nTSD over Missouri School for the Deaf", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:30:14.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
