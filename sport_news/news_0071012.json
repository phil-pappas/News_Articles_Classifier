It had already clinched a postseason spot along with Los Angeles, but the point was enough for the Whitecaps to do the same for the third time in their five MLS seasons and match last year's 50 points.\nDallas is three points back of East-leading New York in the chase for the Supporters' Shield, while Vancouver trails Dallas and the Galaxy by a point in the West with Dallas holding a game in hand.\n\"Having made the playoffs already, I think our goal now is to get a couple wins,\" Vancouver's Jordan Harvey told the club's official website.\n\"I don't think we want to just coast into the playoffs. We want to build some momentum. Going in, we're without a doubt going for three points. Are we disappointed if we get a draw? Probably not. But the goal is to get three points and build momentum.\"\nPedro Morales and Nicolas Mezquida aren't with the team because of hamstring injuries, while Mauro Rosales (adductor), Cristian Techera (hamstring) and Pa-Modou Kah (groin) are considered questionable.\nThe Whitecaps also figure to be without Kendall Waston (Costa Rica) and Darren Mattocks (Jamaica), as well as Canadians Marco Bustos , Kianz Froese and Sam Adekugbe for international call-ups. All have matches Tuesday, but coach Carl Robinson hasn't yet ruled Waston out after he didn't play in Costa Rica's loss to South Africa on Thursday.\n\"Everyone that's able to walk is going,\" Robinson said. \"We've probably got 16 or 17 healthy bodies leaving here.\"\nAfter the draw, Vancouver has two points and two goals on a four-match winless stretch, though Dallas hasn't been much better with a win and a draw out of its last four. It is, however, 11-2-2 at home.\nThe Whitecaps won the previous meeting 1-0 at home Aug. 22 on a Techera goal, and they've shut out Dallas in three of the last four.\nScoring won't come any easier without Fabian Castillo for a second straight game while the Dallas winger is with Colombia for World Cup qualifiers. The 23-year-old is also rumored to be linked to Premier League side Swansea City , though Dallas is denying interest in any such transfer.\n\"We have Fabian Castillo signed through 2019 and we are not interested in selling key pieces of this franchise,\" team president Dan Hunt said. \"We are trying to build a champion for many years to come starting with one this year. Fabian is a terrific player and I can promise you this isn't the last rumor we will hear.\"\nMidfielder Kellyn Acosta is questionable due to a hamstring injury.\nSports & Recreation Soccer Vancouver Whitecaps FC Dallas   19315/79545   2482/10000   1214/4772  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:27:51.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
