And with CC Sabathia’s alcohol issues, the shakiest of playoff rotations is that much more troubled.\nThe winner-take-all wild-card game Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium against Houston is the type of game Tanaka yearned for when he signed with the Yankees.\n“One of the biggest reasons,’’ Tanaka said Monday of his duel with Astros ace Dallas Keuchel.\nTanaka promised he would not get hit around again by the Astros.\n“I do remember that I wasn’t at my best during that particular time,’’ Tanaka said through interpreter Shingo Horie of that embarrassing outing. “So this time around it’s going to be different.’’\nWhy will things be different this game against the Astros?\n“I can’t go into much detail about the other team,’’ Tanaka said. “All I can say is that I should be able to show everybody a different Masahiro than the last time out.’’\nHe needs to back up those strong words.\nIt’s finally go time for Tanaka, his first postseason performance for the Yankees.\nBut there is that little problem of Tanaka’s June 27 start in Houston when he gave up six runs, seven hits and three home runs over five innings in an ugly 9-6 win over the Astros at their launching pad home.\nChris Carter, rookie Carlos Correa and Jose Altuve all homered against Tanaka as he was staked to a 6-0 lead but gave it all away.\nYankee Stadium is a launching pad, too.\nTanaka needs to come through despite his injury problems, the latest being a hamstring injury. His elbow issues have been well-documented but through it all Tanaka has won 12 games for the Yankees while compiling a 3.51 ERA this season.\nHome runs have done in the right-hander as he has surrendered 25.\nIf his devastating splitter stays up, it can be hit a long, long way.\nIn Yankee Stadium, Tanaka is 13-6 with a 2.98 ERA over 24 career starts.\nYankee fans should be prepared for a more demonstrative Tanaka. This could be key to his success.\nListen to young catcher John Ryan Murphy explain how enjoyable it is to catch Tanaka: “He demands a lot of himself. It’s fun when he gets fired up,’’ Murphy said. “He starts screaming. It’s in there. He is just so good at keeping it masked all the time.’’\nThe mask comes off Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium.\nIt’s the postseason and while not much is expected of this Yankee team, Tanaka is expected to deliver a big performance in his postseason debut for the Yankees.\nHe excelled in the postseason in Japan.\n“As far as the intensity of the game, I think it should be pretty much the same,’’ Tanaka said. “But obviously MLB is a little bit more bigger than the professional baseball in Japan.’’\nYankees manager, Joe Girardi, the ex-catcher, looks at Tanaka this way:\n“I think he has the ability to mix pitches extremely well,” Girardi said. “He has a couple of swing-and-miss pitches and he loves to compete as well. And that makes me feel really good about him.’’\nTanaka is pitching on five day’s rest. Keuchel is pitching on short rest. Tanaka is home. Keuchel is pitching on the road, where he has not been Superman.\nThe Yankees have lined up Tanaka to succeed. In every way they could they have made it easier for him to achieve success, giving him the extra rest, giving him the No. 1 spot in the rotation.\nNow it’s up to him. The Yankees need him more than ever.\nIt’s finally postseason Tanaka Time.\nTime to earn that money.\n  dallas keuchel ,  houston astros ,  masahiro tanaka ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:10:03.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
