The Lions had four runners in the top 16, led by second-place Anna DiMarcello in 18:53. \nTurning point: North’s Ellie DiMarcello and Angela Kearsley finished almost together in seventh and eighth place to give the Lions three runners in while Ridge and Hillsborough had only two each. \nTop performer: Bonaguidi took off a half-mile into the race on the hill in front of the handsome Natirar mansion and was never touched after that. \nWhat it means: For Bonaguidi, a tremendous individual triumph in one of the best cross country conferences in the East, much less the state. And North Hunterdon has served notice that there’s a new sheriff in town – and a new No. 1 in both region and state. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
