Larry Brown Sports 10 hrs ago Steve DelVecchio © Frederick Breedon/Getty Images Is Andrew Luck in danger of missing Week 4 against the Jaguars? The Indianapolis Colts on Friday announced that they have waived cornerback Shaun Prater to make room on their 53-man roster for quarterback Josh Johnson. That could mean Andrew Luck is in danger of missing Sunday’s game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nAdChoices Johnson, a former fifth-round draft pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is now the third quarterback on Indy’s active roster. The Colts typically only carry two with Luck and veteran backup Matt Hasselbeck. It’s possible Johnson has merely been brought in as insurance, but the timing is a concern with Luck having not thrown at practice on Wednesday or Thursday .\n:\nLuck is dealing with some sort of injury to his throwing shoulder. Colts coach Chuck Pagano has said that he “would not bet against” Luck playing against Jacksonville, but the signing of Johnson almost certainly means there is some doubt. ESPN’s Adam Schefter also reported on Thursday that Luck is “ legitimately questionable ” for Sunday.\nIf Luck can effectively play through the pain and not injure himself further, he probably will. The Colts are off to a 1-2 start and can’t afford to risk losing to a team like the Jaguars if they want to keep pace in the AFC.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/649742551470186496", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/aRJ1HYSKYmN", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/andrew-luck-not-throwing-shoulder-injury/276168"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:15:30.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
