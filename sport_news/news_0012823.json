Oh, and forget what you know about the Top 25 rankings because the No. 3 Utes are predicted to lose. \nHere's a look at the top storylines before Saturday's game. No. 3 team is the underdog \nWhen a college football team ranks in the nation's top five, it's expected the betting lines have them favored to win. That's not the case for the Utes this weekend. The latest spread for Saturday's matchup has USC as a four-point favorite, making Utah the highest-ranked team as the underdog in the last 20 years. \nUtah is 16-2 when ranked in the AP Top 10. This week marks the seventh-consecutive week the Utes are recognized among the nation's best 25 teams. \n\"We have to be at our absolute best this week to have a chance,\" said Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham. \nWhittingham added his team is \"very mentally tough, has a great work ethic and driven.\" \nIt's time for the Utes to carry that into the Coliseum. Utahns on the other side \nWhen recruits make their school selections, fans cross their fingers players stay in-state. But it hardly seems like that ever happens. \nLast year was no different. \nThe state of Utah's top two prospects, Osa Masina from Brighton High School and Porter Gustin from Salem Hills High School, both chose to attend USC. The linebackers, who passed on offers from the Utes, knew each other well before becoming teammates in California. The pair made it to last year's U.S. Army All-American Bowl. \nSo far this season, Masina has 22 tackles and recovered a fumble for a 46-yard touchdown. Gustin has 13 tackles. \nThis game is also a battle of brothers. Masina's brother — Uaea — plays linebacker for the Utes. \n\"I'll always be happy for them, but when they play us it's a different situation,\" Osa told ESPN , mentioning he knows nearly everyone on the Utah roster. 100-year California drought \nThe last time the Utes and Trojans battled, it was a nail-biter. With the team down 21-17, quarterback Travis Wilson led Utah 73 yards in the last couple minutes. Wilson threw an 18-yard pass to get on the 1-yard line, where Kaelin Clay caught the game-winning touchdown. \nUSC had one last chance to grab the win, but Nate Orchard and Hunter Dimick sacked Cody Kessler to secure the victory. \nThe Trojans control the series, leading 9-4. Both teams started playing against each other in 1915, when Utah clinched a 20-13 win. Last year and 2001's competitions are the Utes' most recent victories. The last time they won in Los Angeles was in 1916. \nSaturday's game will air on FOX at 5:30 p.m. MDT with commentators Gus Johnson, Joel Klatt and Molly McGrath.
