Kick off happens 3:30 p.m. at Memorial Stadium in Bloomington. \nHere are ten things to know before the game: \n\n1. Ohio State Creating A Dynasty In Big Ten Play \nOhio State has won 24 consecutive regular season games against conference opponents, going 8-0 in three straight seasons. This is good enough for a Big Ten record. \n\n2. History Has A Funny Way Of Repeating Itself \nOhio State and Indiana haven’t played each other while undefeated since 1942 when they both shared a record of 1-0. Ohio State won the contest 32-21 and later went on to be voted the Associated Press National Champion for the first national title in school history. \n\n3. \"Home, Home On The Road\" \nUrban Meyer is a perfect 15-0 while playing on the road with Ohio State, only allowing a scarce 110.3 ypg rushing during that stretch. \n\n4. A Truly Dynamic Duo \nBoth Braxton Miller and Ezekiel Elliott find themselves inside the top 11 in career rushing yards amongst all active players in the FBS. Miller is third with 3,190 yads while Elliot is eleventh with a total of 2,595 yards. \n\n5. Urban’s Special Teams Pay Off \nOhio State Punter Cameron Johnston refused to give up good field position to Western Michigan last week with his four punts averaging 51.5yds and two of them inside the ten yard line. This was good enough to earn him the Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week. \n\n6. Jones Steps Up His Play \nCardale Jones had a much better performance this past week against Western Michigan as he passed for a career high of 288 yds with 19 total completions. He also threw for two touchdowns in the game. \n\n7.Bosa Looks To Be Crowned Sack King \nJoey Bosa is currently second in the FBS in career sacks with 21.5, only trailing the leader by half a sack! \n\n8. Better Luck This Year? \nEzekiel Elliot is looking for his tenth straight game with 100 or more rushing yards. This streak includes his three consecutive 200 yard performances in last year’s post season and the streak began last year against Indiana. \n\n9. Jacoby Boren, STUDENT Athlete \nSenior offensive Lineman Jacoby Boren becomes a semi-finalist for the William V. Campbell Award. This award recognizes the best football scholar athlete in the nation. Finalists will be announced Oct. 29. \n\n10. Offensive Mastermind \nOhio State has now scored at least 40 points in six consecutive games which sets a new school record. Since Urban Meyer arrived in 2012 he has helped Ohio State’s offense average an incredible 42.1 points per game. He's hip, he's cool. ©2015 by 10TV.com. All rights reserved.
