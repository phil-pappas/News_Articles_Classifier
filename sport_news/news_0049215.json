NEW YORK — A jury is deliberating in the New York City trial of a professional basketball player charged with resisting arrest and other crimes.\nAdChoices The six-person panel on Thursday asked to see video of the April 8 confrontation between the Atlanta Hawks' Thabo Sefolosha (tah-BOH' sehf-ah-LOH'-shuh) and police officers.\nThe guard-forward has pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor obstructing government administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges.\nProsecutors say he disobeyed their orders to clear the street after another NBA player was stabbed outside a trendy Manhattan nightclub.\nBut the Swiss national testified he was moving up the block and attempting to give a beggar money when he was grabbed by officers. He has said his leg was broken in the ensuing struggle, causing him to miss the playoffs.\n© AP Photo/Seth Wenig Thabo Sefolosha, center, leaves criminal court in New York, Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015.
