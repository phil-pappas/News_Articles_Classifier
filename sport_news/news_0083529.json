Blue Devil junior Alex Iben finished the boys’ 5-kilometer race in fourth place at 15 minutes, 23.4 seconds, less than 40 seconds behind the winner Phillip Fishburn of Kamiakin. “Iben was in second for the first two miles, and then wasn’t able to hold on,” Locati said. “I felt he ran a really great first half. Normally, he is able to close really well, but the intital pace was a little too much to overcome.” Wa-Hi junior Grayson Gillin soon followed Iben, finishing 10th at 15:50.6, while teammates Andrew Feistner hit the line 16th at 16:15.3, with Reid Reinninger and John Peters next for the Blue Devils. “Reininger was really the spark plug with that whole group,” Locati said. “Gillin had the fastest closing mile for us. That is his trademark. You can usually always count on Grayson for a great close. “Mile one, the leaders were out in 4:50 and under 10:00 at the second mile,” he said. “Everyone was fast — that’s just this course. They handled it really well and kept moving through the second half of the race.” Meanwhile, Erika Leinweber paced the Wa-Hi girls, finishing in fifth place at 18:48.7, about 20 seconds behind McKinzi Teeples of Kamiakin. “It was good to have Erika back this week,” Locati said. “We’re still not at full gear, but we have a few weeks to get there. The first half of the race it was Erika and the two Hanford girls, with Kamiakin right behind. After that, Erika wasn’t able to hold and fell back some.” DeSales’ Anna Ruthven took sixth place at 19:01.3. “Ruthven had a solid race,” Locati said. “A gap opened up and she was kind of stuck there and she had a hard time closing it. She is tough and I suspect next week’s district race for her will be very good.” Wa-Hi’s cross country runners next compete next Thursday at Richland’s Leslie Groves Park. W-M’s Scott, Waitsburg’s Adams top local harriers at Wildhorse MISSION, Ore. — Weston-McEwen’s Hayden Scott topped local harriers at the Kyle Burnside Wildhorse Invite here on Thursday, finishing in second place in 16:26.0 behind Umatilla’s Fabian Cardenas’ 15:54.6. On the girls side of the meet, Waitsburg’s Emily Adams came in sixth in 20:06.4 over the 5,000-meter course. Scott’s finished helped the TigerScots’ boys team to a 12th-place finish with 318 points. Waitsburg was 13th with 398, Helix came in 17th with 458 and McLoughlin 18th with 479. Hermiston won with 57 points. Mac-Hi’s girls were the lone local team, finishing 10th in 246 points. Union won with 51 points. For the boys, Waitsburg’s Landon Callas topped the Cardinals with a 24th in 17:40.8, and W-M’sTanner Sater was 63rd in 18:58.9. On the girls’ side, Pomeroy’s Makayla Miller was 12th in 20:50.3, Mac-Hi’s Elise Griffith led the Pioneers with a 30th-place finish in 22:01.3, and W-M’s Katie Vescio was 40th in 22:21.7.
