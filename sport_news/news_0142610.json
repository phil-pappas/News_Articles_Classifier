It’s not something I ever want to remember doing. It’s just a bad feeling.”\nThe second miss gave the Ravens (1-3) enough time to put Tucker well within range to force the extra period. It also gave Tomlin pause when the Steelers moved into Baltimore territory twice in overtime.\nBoth times Tomlin opted to go for it with backup quarterback Michael Vick rather than send out Scobee for another long attempt into the unforgiving end of one of the trickiest places to kick in the NFL. Vick, starting in place of injured Ben Roethlisberger, was stopped on fourth-and-2 at the 39 and later overthrew Antonio Brown on fourth-and-1 from the 33.\n“We lost, so I’m not going to try and justify anything that we did,” Tomlin said. “Anything we did, I take responsibility for.”\nNeither Vick nor Scobee would get a third shot. Joe Flacco led the Ravens to the Pittsburgh 35 and Tucker’s winner was never in doubt even though Harbaugh admitted he considered trying to get a little closer. “To be able to come in and win in such a dramatic fashion with just a consummate team effort, it’s really special,” Tucker said. \nIt hardly mattered to Tucker, who “definitely” knew the winner was good the second it left his foot.\nJustin Forsett ran for 150 yards for the Ravens. Flacco threw a touchdown pass and did just enough late to help Baltimore end the worst start in franchise history.\n“The first win for us should [propel] us to go on to big things,” Tucker said.\nVick threw for 124 yards and a score and Le’Veon Bell ran for 129 yards and a touchdown but the Steelers bumbled late.\n“It’s probably one of the toughest losses of my career,” Vick said. “We had our chances to win the game. There were a lot of plays I could’ve made that I didn’t make.”\nFor most of the night, it appeared Pittsburgh would survive with Roethlisberger relegated to a sweatsuit after spraining his left knee last week against St. Louis.\nThe Steelers sacked Flacco five times, forced a pair of turnovers and twice stopped the Ravens on downs in the fourth quarter to seemingly seize control only to have Scobee let Baltimore back in it.\n“The last two I played them down the middle and they both moved,” said Scobee, who is 6 of 10 on the season. “It’s a tough end to kick because it’s a little more open area. It’s something that takes experience.”\nOne Scobee might not get, with Tomlin saying the Steelers “have to turn stones over” in an effort to win games.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under baltimore ravens ,  nfl ,  pittsburgh steelers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:35:20.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
