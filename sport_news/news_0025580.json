Lowy said he would order a competency evaluation despite objections from the prosecution. Chism, who is charged with murdering and raping his high school math teacher two years ago when he was 14, refused to enter the courtroom at all on Wednesday.\nA court psychologist who spoke with him testified that Chism was a withdrawn, suicidal teenager who barely understood the charges against him. The 16-year-old told the clinician a voice told him not to trust his defense attorneys, who had been working with him without issue for two years.\nLowy said he didn’t have much choice but to order the evaluation. If the trial went forward, and Chism was convicted, the case would surely be appealed, he said.\n“It would be a reversible error in a blink of an eye,” the judge said.\nChism has pleaded not guilty in Essex County to charges of murder, armed robbery and two counts of rape. Prosecutors allege he slashed the throat of his 24-year-old math teacher, Colleen Ritzer, in the bathroom of Danvers High School, and dragged her body into the woods in a recycling bin. He was found hours later walking along a road in nearby Topsfield with Ritzer’s credit cards, women’s underwear and a box cutter.\nChism will be sent to Worcester State Hospital for the evaluation. Lowy ordered that Chism should be held in an adult locked unit, with no access to any non-secure hospital grounds. He won’t be allowed out of the hospital without court permission.\nBecause he is 16, he will be treated as a juvenile while he is detained. But because he is facing a murder charge as an adult, he must be given maximum security treatment.\nEssex County Assistant District Attorney Kate MacDougall reiterated her position that Chism is faking and manipulating the court. She has asked for video recordings of Chism’s behavior in the Salem Superior Court holding cell.\n“The Commonwealth’s fears have come to fruition,” she said.\nWhile Chism was absent from court Tuesday and Wednesday, he sat next to his attorneys quietly Thursday, head hung, while the judge and attorneys discussed where he would go.\nLowy asked a Department of Mental Health commissioner to make sure the evaluation—which can take up to 20 days—is done as quickly as it can comprehensively be done.\nAnd if it can’t be done quickly, Lowy wants to know as soon as possible. That way the hundreds of people involved in the case—witnesses, jurors, experts, family members—can be informed that the trial isn’t going forward at this point, Lowy said.\nLast year, prosecutors raised issues in court documents about the security surrounding Chism, noting the lax practices of Worcester State Hospital in other cases. Chism attacked a young female Department of Youth Services clinician at a facility in Dorchester in June 2014. He is facing charges in that case in Suffolk County.\nDuring jury selection, defense attorneys have hinted at an insanity defense, which would mean that Chism did not understand that the crime he committed was wrong at the time. Competency is a different issue. A defendant must be competent—able to understand the charges against him and to assist in his own defense—to stand trial.\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Teen charged with murdering teacher will be evaluated at state hospital; trial on hold 10.15.15 | 12:06 PM Mass.’s unemployment rate dropped in September 10.15.15 | 11:47 AM Big Dig springs big leaks 10.15.15 | 9:27 AM After nearly 11 years, St. Frances parishioners ordered to leave church 10.15.15 | 8:59 AM Delays on Mass Pike inside Prudential Tunnel 10.15.15 | 8:58 AM Those upside-down billboards are being turned around 10.15.15 | 8:57 AM Marco Rubio used Mike Dukakis to diss Democrats 10.15.15 | 8:41 AM Google is bringing its ‘Street View’ to the Charles 10.15.15 | 8:36 AM Report: Feds questioning legality of daily fantasy sports 10.15.15 | 7:38 AM BU creates task force to address faculty diversity 10.15.15 | 5:59 AM Here’s Don Orsillo’s first day with the San Diego Padres 10.14.15 | 10:34 PM The Lincoln Chafee frog scandal that undermines his one strong debate moment 10.14.15 | 10:09 PM Man convicted of killing South Boston grandmother sentenced to life without parole 10.14.15 | 9:52 PM Harvard student sets new Guinness record for standing on a workout ball 10.14.15 | 9:42 PM Caramel apples are breeding ground for listeria, researchers say 10.14.15 | 7:16 PM Sen.
