(WYMT) -- The Class 5A, District 7 title will be on the line Friday night in Somerset as the No. 1 ranked Pulaski County Maroons host the No. 3 Southwestern Warriors. \n\"We just got to stay focused and do our jobs, maintain their D-line and their linebackers,\" Maroons senior quarterback Riley Hall said. \"Their front seven is really tough with Lucas Turpin and them. We just got to do what we do best. These are the games we're going to remember for the rest of our lives So may as well make the best of it while we can and leave it all on the field. \" \nThe Warriors have won six straight after losing to Bourbon County in late August. \nSouthwestern beat Pulaski in the regular season last year, but the Maroons got them when it mattered in the region final. \n\"We're still a little bitter about the loss in region,\" Southwestern sophomore running back Patric Edwards said. \"We would've rather got that one, than the one in the regular season. We're looking to get them this time, but more importantly we're trying to get back to that region championship and see them again there. The biggest threat that we pose, I think that our speed will help us a lot and I think our defensive line is definitely a threat. I think they'll give Pulaski a lot of trouble.\" \nKickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. on THIS-TV and WYMT.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:48:45.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
