As per the NADA report, he is free to compete as he has sought a B sample test,\" a source in the Army Sports Institute, where SSCB boxers train, told PTI. \n\nBut it is his call whether he wants to because if the B sample also comes positive than his performance in the Games would count for nothing,\" he added. \n\nThe former national champion, who has no past record in doping, won his Asian Games silver medal in the 2010 edition in Guangzhou, China. \n\n\"It seems to be a case of accidental intake because he does not have that kind of track record. The banned substance was in the cough syrup and he seems to have consumed it without knowing,\" another source said.
