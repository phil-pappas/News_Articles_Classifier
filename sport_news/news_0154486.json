While Robinson totaled five kills, Anna Gookin had nine kills and Morgan Stoecklein and Haley Richards had six kills each. \n“That’s something I love to see,” Shiloh head coach Nathan Bodenstein said. “When we are balanced and get all the hitters in the game, we are going to be tough to stop.” \nAllie Pitts had 15 assists and Hannah Smithson 12 assists for the Saints (13-5, 10-0 4A-1). Libero Celestene Sebags had 11 digs and Robinson had seven digs. The team also totaled 18 ace serves. \n“It was senior night, and I think they stepped up,” Bodenstein said. “They’ve only got two home games left and I don’t think they’ve ever lost on their home floor. We had a bit of a mid-season slump the last few games but we came out tonight and executed better and made very few errors.” \nPrairie Grove (2-15, 2-8) could take heart from a solid effort in the third game. Riley Gerwig totaled a couple of kills and big block on Robinson in the game and Cadi Williamson had a tip kill and an ace. \n“It seemed like Riley had more kills than showed up on the stat sheet (6) and Cadi had a good hustle game,” Prairie Grove coach Lindsey Layes said. “I’m encouraged by the way we played in the third game. We kept playing hard and played our best then against a good team. The best thing for us is we are almost all juniors and sophomores.” \n(Advertisement)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:38:03.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
