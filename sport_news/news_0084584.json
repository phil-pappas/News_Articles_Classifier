They are clear as day, the two of them cheering on the boys in blue from Row G of Kauffman Stadium. But Philpot remembers none of it.\n\"I told him everything that had happened in the game, nothing. He didn't remember any of it,\" Thomas said.\nPhilpot, a commercial pilot, was on a layover in Philadelphia two weeks after that game when he suffered a stroke in the memory part of his brain.\n\"In the hospital when the doctor was talking to my wife about the World Series, I had no clue we had been to the World Series or anything had happened in that last month,\" Philpot said. \nHe suffered a hemangioma, a brain bleed from a birth mark-like growth that doctors suspected had been there for years. It had never been a problem until the growth started to bleed.\nThe Philpot's are so confident in the Royals' making the World Series again, they haven't been to a postseason game yet.  They are saving the moment for Philpot to re-live with his son one year after the memory robbing stroke.\n\"This year I felt a lot more pressure because it's like, we've got to get back there so I can go figure out this World Series thing with my sons. I want to make sure we can talk about this 20 years from now about what a good time we had,\" he said. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
