The Crimson Tide’s league and national title hopes probably couldn’t survive another SEC West loss. \nKEY MATCHUP \nAlabama’s defensive line versus Arkansas’ offensive line. The Razorbacks’ starting five averages 328 pounds from tackle to tackle and has the task of facing a deep, big Tide line and one of college football’s best front sevens. Alabama contained Georgia star tailback Nick Chubb for most of last week’s game. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nArkansas: QB Brandon Allen is making his fourth start against Alabama after filling in for an injured Tyler Wilson as a freshman in 2012. He and the Razorbacks have come a long way after back to back 52-0 losses, losing 14-13 last season. Allen will have to do what Georgia’s quarterbacks couldn’t: pass successfully enough to keep the Tide from loading up against the run. \nAlabama: LB Reggie Ragland is the leader of the defense and a hard hitter who will be a key factor in trying to contain RB Alex Collins and the Razorbacks’ ground game. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nThe Razorbacks are 0-8 against Alabama since Nick Saban arrived in Tuscaloosa and have lost five straight at Bryant-Denny Stadium. … Arkansas is trying to win back-to-back SEC road games for the first time since 2011. … Tide RB Derrick Henry is seeking to extend his streak of games with a touchdown to 11, which would break a tie with former quarterback Terry Davis (set in 1971-72). … Collins has joined Darren McFadden (2007) as the only Arkansas players to rush for 150-plus yards in three straight games.
