(Tom Worgo, Baltimore Sun Media Group) Tom Worgo Contact Reporter Towson Times Notre Dame Prep goalie Ashley Gabor has recorded 17 shutouts over the past two seasons. \nIt has taken time for Notre Dame Prep junior goalie Ashley Gabor to step out of older sister Tori’s shadow. \nIn her second year as a starter, Ashley has led the Blazers to an 18-6-3 record. More impressive, she has 18 shutouts. \nMeanwhile, Tori, who was the starting keeper all four years at Notre Dame Prep, now plays for the University of Louisville in the powerhouse Atlantic Coast Conference. \n“It’s definitely tough following her because she is such a good goalie,” said Ashley, a Whitehall resident, about her sibling. “I have to work really hard even when she’s not around. I always have to compete with her and try to be as good as her because I look up to her.” \nLike her sister, Ashley will play college soccer, choosing between three favorites: Syracuse and Pepperdine universities and the University of Virginia. \n“I expect her to have a good college career,” Notre Dame Prep soccer coach Val Teixeira said about the U.S. under-16 national pool player. “And she has a lot of options before she makes a decision. Florida State, Maryland, Virginia and Syracuse have recruited her. These are schools that have been established for a while in the soccer rankings — schools that have been in the top-20 in the nation.” Notre Dame Prep goalie Ashley Gabor File photo/Baltimore Sun \nNotre Dame Prep goalie Ashley Gabor, left, has recorded shutouts in four of the last six games for the Blazers and 18 overall. \n\nNotre Dame Prep goalie Ashley Gabor, left, has recorded shutouts in four of the last six games for the Blazers and 18 overall. \n(File photo/Baltimore Sun) \nAshley believes the training she did with Tori last summer is helping her tremendously, improving her fitness level and sharpening her skills in the goal in preparation for the fall campaign. \n“I am always trying to push her,” Tori said. “If I am home, I will get her to go to the gym with me.” \nTeixeira said above all, he noticed a better-conditioned goalie during the preseason in August, giving Teixeira the impetus to pick her as team captain. \n“I really saw an improvement in her fitness and strength,” he explained. \nAt the urging of her sister, Ashley feels that she has also become a better communicator. \nIt wasn’t easy for her to speak up as part of a 2014 team loaded with seniors that compiled a 12-3-2 mark before bowing in a shootout in the Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland A Conference final to McDonogh, which was a consensus No. 1 in national rankings. \n“Last year, I was pretty quiet,” said Ashley, who recorded nine shutouts last season and only allowed four goals to earn All-State honors. “Now that I am a captain, I know I have to take that role seriously and be a vocal leader. My teammates look up to me and listen to me. They definitely understand when I tell them to do something.” \nThe 5-foot-9 Ashley is the most intense and hardest working player during Notre Dame Prep practices. \n“Sometimes, she works too hard,” Teixeira said. “I have to tell her to relax a little bit because we have a game the next day. She is diving three or four feet into the air to save balls. She wants to save everything and makes unbelievable saves.” \nTeixeira gets excited watching her work during penalty kicks. \n“She is one of the best goalies I have ever seen in penalty kicks,” he said. “She is very calm. Sometimes, she is too calm. I am like, ‘How does she save that?' She never panics. She makes the impossible saves look so easy. She is a big reason why went to the finals.” \nAshley might be playing the best soccer of her career over the last month for 7-3-1 Blazers, who have won five of their last six games and are in line for a No. 3 seed in the upcoming playoffs. \nDuring that sizzling stretch, Ashley — who is backed up by Gabby Christy and Alyssa Minnick — recorded shutouts against National Cathedral School (D.C.), Mount de Sales Academy, Severn School and Mercy High. \n“This year, I am more comfortable in the position and I really know what I am doing a lot more,” Ashley said. \nAshley has developed her skills playing for top-caliber club soccer teams for the past years, including the Premier Soccer Club, the Maryland Bays and Penn Fusion soccer club. \nShe travels nearly two hours for practices on the weekend to suburban Philadelphia with Penn Fusion. \nAshley also represented Region I of the Olympic Developmental Program in Costa Rica this year. \nWith the high school season winding down, Tori will play close attention to how Notre Dame Prep and her sister perform in the playoffs. \n“At her age now, she is better than when I was a junior,” she said. \"You can tell, she has such a heart and passion for the game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:26:05.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
