They hope to repeat that effort tonight when they host the Arizona Coyotes.\n\"Whether it’s Cory or Keith in the net, they always give us a chance to win,\" center Adam Henrique said Monday. \"A lot of times when we’ve struggled to get that second or third one, they would always hold it to one or two. We know if we can find a way to get that second or third goal, we’re giving ourselves a chance to win.\"\nSuch an approach puts a lot of pressure on the goaltenders, knowing they probably can’t afford to give up more than one goal, but they seem to be embracing it.\n\"I think that’s our goal every game,\" said Schneider, who has stopped 59 of 61 shots in his past two starts. \"You never want to give up two or three and hope you win. I think the key is we want to keep it in that range.\"\nThe Devils’ goaltenders — Schneider with two starts and Kinkaid one — have allowed only one goal in each of the past three games (not including empty-netters) and that was only good enough to produce three points: the overtime win over the Rangers and a 2-1 shootout loss to San Jose on Friday. That’s because the Devils scored only one goal in regulation in all three of those contests. It took overtime for them to get the second goal Sunday.\nOverall, the Devils have scored only eight goals, including just two in 5-on-5 play. They have not scored first in any of their first five games. In fact, they have yet to play with a lead.\nThanks to Schneider and Kinkaid, however, they’ve been in every game.\n\"When your goaltender’s strong in net for you, it helps everyone,\" Devils coach John Hynes said. \"It helps your defensemen feel a little bit more comfortable in the D zone or going back for pucks. It helps your team believe that there’s not going to be a huge deficit that you have to come back [from]. And each game, Keith and Cory have made some big-time stops for us at key points in the game that have either kept us tied or kept us down one and those things bring energy to your bench.\"\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:47:39.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
