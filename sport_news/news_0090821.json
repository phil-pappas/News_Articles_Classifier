There's certain plays I should be making and I'm not because I can't physically do it. There's so much to think about. Coming to this team, the team we have, you just want to come out here and perform, so I was just trying to fight it off. I can't play through pain. I can, but it's not going well for me.\"\nMcCoy said he suffered a setback to his hamstring injury the Thursday before the Dolphins game and hasn't felt right since.\n\"I kind of hurt it again, and that's where it went wrong,\" McCoy said. \"I tried to really push it. I guess I messed something up.\"\nFor McCoy, a running back who relies on his burst and elusiveness, fighting through pain in his hamstring is negatively impacting him to the point where he isn't able to play his game.\n\"It's acceleration,\" McCoy said. \"Some plays I can't get to 100 percent, full speed, usually where I can accelerate through, burst through. I don't have the same get off. To be honest, I'm not the bruising type where I just run through everybody. My thing is making them miss and getting out of there. You can't do that, you can't do nothing.\"\nWorking in the Bills' favor is the fact that rookie running back Karlos Williams has been a revelation, scoring touchdowns in his first three games and rushing for 110 yards against the Dolphins.\n\"You want to do so much, but he's playing so well that I can actually take a break,\" McCoy said. \"He's been carrying the running game. I haven't, he has. Knowing that makes the offense better because you have some depth. He's opened some eyes with the offensive coordinator and Rex. Knowing that, you have a little more confidence in the rookie to go out there and make plays. You need that. It's a long season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:47:18.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
