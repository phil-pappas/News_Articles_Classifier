Deven Marrero's single up the middle off Andrew Bailey scored Travis Shaw to break an 11th-inning tie, and Boston beat the Yankees, 9-5, on Wednesday night. The third consecutive win for the Red Sox in the Bronx denied New York's attempt to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in three seasons. The Yankees also sit one win away from securing the 10,000th victory in franchise history. \"We were aware there was the potential for them to celebrate,\" interim manager Torey Lovullo said. \"We hung in there to hold off that celebration.\" The Red Sox are 8-10 against New York, with one more game to go between the rivals this season on Thursday. \"The way we've been playing over the last couple weeks, it's been fun — the sense of pride,\" said starter Wade Miley. \"Obviously we're out of it, but the way these guys have kept battling and what the bullpen has done, it's a big statement.\" Mookie Betts hit a pair of home runs against the Yankees bullpen, tying the game at five with a solo shot off Dellin Betances and punctuating the 11th-inning outburst with a two-run blast off Chasen Shreve. The Red Sox have eight home runs in this series; none have been hit by a player above the age of 25. Betts has three of them, giving him 18 on the season. \"It’s hard to believe 160 pounds can generate that type of bat speed and that torque on a baseball, but he does,\" Lovullo said. \"He's not missing his pitch right now.\" Betts had a peculiar reason for the recent Red Sox power surge. \"Me and Blake [Swihart], yesterday when we got to eat, we had a pizza left. He said the night before he had given [extra pizza] to a homeless guy and he hit two home runs,\" Betts explained. \"So I had a pizza and I gave it to a homeless guy and hit two home runs. So maybe pass it onto the next person.\" Handing out pizza on the streets of New York is the new market inefficiency, it seems. Boston somehow emerged from this battle of the bullpens despite wielding a knife compared to New York's cannon. Whereas the Yankees simply went to their back-end trio of Justin Wilson, Betances and Andrew Miller in the critical later innings, Lovullo looked like he was trying to win a game of chess with just his pawns. Lovullo used four pitchers to get six scoreless outs in the seventh and eighth — a task they managed despite the considerable handicap of walking six Yankees in the process. A Tommy Layne pick-off of Jacoby Ellsbury played a key role in that ode to Houdini. Alexi Ogando tossed two scoreless innings himself to pick up the win. Page 2 of 2 - \"It wasn’t pristine. But when they needed to make a pitch, when they needed to pick each other up, they did a great job,\" Lovullo said. \"Our relievers were able to keep us in the game.\" The final frames required such maneuvering because Miley delivered his shortest outing of the season's second half. Miley's final start of 2015 crammed in most of the elements that defined his first year with the Red Sox. There was a snippet of swift dominance, the way Miley discarded the first five hitters with ease. There was quickly accelerating tumult in the middle innings: Miley allowed three runs in the fifth to give back a 4-1 advantage. There was a recovery, as he stranded the bases loaded that frame by inducing a flyout from Didi Gregorius. There was even his finger-snap pace: Miley's 29-pitch second inning still only took eight minutes. Miley cruises when he operates within the strike zone as he did earlier in the game, and a loss of command in the zone generally foreshadows a loss of command in the game. That’s what happened in the fifth, when Miley allowed a pair of doubles and three walks in the frame. Miley threw a staggering 40 pitches in that inning and 109 to record his 15 outs. He had finished at least six frames in each of his previous 10 starts. \"It wasn’t the way I wanted to finish,\" Miley said. \"You can always get better.\" The overall picture of Miley's season is perhaps one that inspires a shrug. The left-hander was largely what the Red Sox expected, bringing with him from Arizona a track record of consistent competence that he more or less fulfilled. The left-hander took the ball every five days for the entirety of the season, with Wednesday marking his 32nd trip to the mound for Boston. Only twice did he pitch on more than normal rest all year. The Red Sox acquired Miley last winter for Rubby De La Rosa and Allen Webster because they needed to fill out a shallow rotation. Miley was known in a way that De La Rosa and Webster — pitchers who struggled for Boston last season and who didn’t take major steps forward this year for the Diamondbacks — weren't. In that sense, Miley was as advertised. The circumstances figure to be different this winter for the Red Sox, though. They have built up an inventory of ostensibly competent starters, many of them coming from the left side. Eduardo Rodriguez has earned a spot in next year's rotation. Henry Owens has been impressive over the last two months. Joe Kelly found a rhythm, albeit briefly. As Boston goes about constructing its 2016 rotation, it very well might look to trade Miley's quantity for a different kind of quality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:02:24.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
