That's just something I couldn't go away from.\" That passion for the game has turned Wellington into a star running back and linebacker at Eastside Catholic.\"It's just something I'm passionate about,\" Wellington said. \"When I'm out here practicing with my brothers, it's a football family. It's a bond you can never break.\" Wellington is one of the top recruits in the country. He's been offered scholarships by Texas Christian, Arizona State, Washington State, and many others.\"I think he's going to be a great player at the next level,\" said Eastside Catholic head coach Jeremy Thielbahr. \"Some of it's luck, some of it's opportunity, some of it's staying injury free, but the skill set, tools, love for the game, and ability to brace the grind -- Brandon Wellington is your guy.\" Despite all the attention Wellington is getting from schools, there's only one place he wants to go: the University of Washington. He committed to the Huskies last year before his junior season.\"It's Washington, man. It's my hometown,\" said Wellington. \"There's nothing better than that, playing on Montlake. Thousands of fans screaming. It will be a good experience.\" Now a senior at Eastside Catholic, Wellington's career is winding down on the plateau. Before he leaves, though, Wellington dreams of a second straight state title with the Crusaders. But Wellington can't also help but think of the day he takes the field at Husky Stadium.\"It's going to be amazing,\" said Wellington. \"It's going to be an exciting feeling to finally run out there with the team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:35:02.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
