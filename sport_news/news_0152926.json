As described by SB Nation and Sporting News , Arizona Diamondbacks announcers Bob Brenly and Steve Berthiaume mocked a group of female students from Alpha Chi Omega at Arizona State University for taking selfies during the game Wednesday. \"That's the best one of 300 pictures I took of myself today!\" says one, followed by this exchange: \"Every girl in the picture is locked into her phone.\"\"Oh, Lord.\"\"Every single one is dialed in. Welcome to parenting in 2015.\" As it happens, the two minutes of shaming occurred during a T-Mobile Fan Photo promotion that was about getting fans to snap photos during the game and send them in for use during the broadcast. Lo and behold, the students were offered free tickets for the next game. Here's an excerpt of their response on Facebook : \"We appreciate their generous offer of tickets to tonight’s game. However, instead of chapter members attending the game, we have asked the Diamondbacks and Fox Sports to provide tickets to a future game for families at A New Leaf, a local non-profit that helps support victims of domestic violence. Today, October 1, marks the beginning of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. If everyone who viewed this statement took the time to make a donation in recognition of domestic violence awareness, which is Alpha Chi Omega’s national philanthropy, we would be so grateful!\" For more, see SB Nation's rundown of reactions from people in the sports world who were outraged to see the announcers mock the students.
