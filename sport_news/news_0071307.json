Despite all the talk about Tom Brady, the lasting image of the New England Patriots' AFC Championship game rout last season was the running game overpowering the Indianapolis Colts defense.\nChuck Pagano won't have to worry about stopping Jonas Gray this time, but his defense has yielded 657 yards in its last three game against the Patriots. That pace can't continue in Sunday's prime time rematch, or Brady will have most of his work already done for him.\n“Our No. 1 goal is to stop the run,” Colts defensive end Kendall Langford said, according to the Indianapolis Star . “But this team’s a new team. That team is a new team.”\nUSA TODAY SPORTS WIRE\nUSA TODAY Sports' Week 6 NFL picks\nNew England hasn't had to rely on its 29th-ranked rushing attack much with Brady on an MVP pace. But Dion Lewis, who's questionable for Sunday, has been a revelation, and LeGarrette Blount remains effective as a late-game hammer.\nThe Colts must corral the run without bending to personnel adjustments that leave them vulnerable to a big strike from Brady. A steady effort from the defensive line has the rushing defense ranked No. 19 so far this year.\nBut Indianapolis' numbers might be skewed by a passing defense opposing teams are eager to attack. The Colts rank 28th in passing yards allowed and have yet to face an upper-echelon aerial attack.\nGetting Brady off the field won't be easy for the Colts defense. But it will be next to impossible if the Patriots have a repeat performance on the ground.\nHere are four other matchups that will define Week 6:\nSeattle Seahawks RB Marshawn Lynch vs. Carolina Panthers LB Luke Kuechly\nMarshawn Lynch might be able to help the Seahawks get back on track. (Photo: Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports)\nIt's unclear what the respective stars of the Seahawks offense and Panthers defense will provide in their returns from multi-game absences.\nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll said Friday that Lynch was \"back to full health\" after being sidelined by a hamstring injury. Despite the emergence of undrafted rookie running back Thomas Rawls, Lynch's presence is crucial to a Seahawks offense still sorting itself out.\nEven though Lynch is averaging 3.4 yards per carry, he allows the team to return to its established offensive identity. That's needed more than ever given the league-high 22 sacks allowed on Russell Wilson and an inability to integrate tight end Jimmy Graham.\nKuechly is back for the first time since suffering a concussion in Week 1, though coach Ron Rivera might limit his contributions. But he should solidify an already stout run defense and keep Wilson out of comfortable situations.\nUSA TODAY\nBell Tolls: Johnny Football not fooling anybody following latest incident\nCincinnati Bengals receivers vs. Buffalo Bills defensive backs\nOne week after surviving the Seahawks' defensive line, the Bengals now must withstand the Bills' blitzes.\nAndy Dalton is enjoying a career year, thanks in part to the stellar protection of the offensive line and a lessened reliance on A.J. Green. If Dalton has his time against Buffalo, he could find easy opportunities for his receivers to make big plays.\nAnd for all the hype placed on Rex Ryan's defense, the Bills rank 23rd against the pass and have just nine sacks in five games.\nStill, cornerbacks Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby have been standouts so far this year. Both will need to be solid in coverage as well as tackling in space against Green, Marvin Jones, Mohamed Sanu and Tyler Eifert.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 6 fantasy football rankings\nPittsburgh Steelers WR Antonio Brown vs. Arizona Cardinals CB Patrick Peterson\nBen Roethlisberger's absence takes a little luster off this showdown. But it still features two of the game's best young talents going head to head.\nBrown's average has plummeted from 145.3 receiving yards per game to 43.5 since Michael Vick took over as starter. The downfield passing attack that Brown thrived in has been shelved in favor of safer opportunities.\nBut the Steelers will have to take their chances at some point, as Le'Veon Bell can't carry the offense alone. Vick needs to take trust Brown, even in a tough matchup.\nThe slimmed-down Peterson is enjoying a resurgent season as one of the league's best cornerbacks. Brown's shiftiness and double moves might be tough to handle, but expect this to be a largely one-on-one showdown.\nUSA TODAY\nPelissero: Peyton Manning's limitations hinder Broncos' offense\nPhiladelphia Eagles QB Sam Bradford vs. New York Giants secondary\nThis could be Bradford's long-awaited breakout game.\nThe Eagles quarterback has back-to-back solid performances under his belt, but his comfort level hasn't remained consistent over the course of a full game. Monday night might provide the same kind of opportunity the Eagles took advantage of last week, when its run game finally got on track against the New Orleans Saints.\nThe Giants' pass defense ranks last in the NFL, and the pass rush is non-existent. Cornerback Prince Amukamara's injury only heightens the concerns in New York.\nBut Giants defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo was Bradford's coach for two years with the St. Louis Rams. He'll need to dial up something special against his former pupil to keep the Giants atop the NFC East.\nPHOTOS: Week 6 games ranked by watchability\n14.
