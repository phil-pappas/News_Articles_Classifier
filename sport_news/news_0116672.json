The Savannah City Council has yet to act on the agreement approved by the county commission Sept. 11.\nIn that version, commissioners removed language that specifically addressed pay raises and added a line that requires any additional costs be recommended to both bodies by the Police Policy Committee, which is made up of the mayor of Savannah, the Chatham County commission chairman and the managers of both governments.\nAddressing the change at a city council meeting the week after the county’s vote, City Manager Stephanie Cutter said she didn’t know whether the two governments were still on the same page.\nIn the weeks that followed, letters were exchanged and commission Chairman Al Scott paid a visit to the city council to show his support for the county’s participation in the raises.\nAt the commission’s last meeting, Oct. 9, Scott announced that the policy committee would meet to discuss police salaries the following week. The short policy committee meeting that followed resulted in the unanimous recommendation from the four members that Chatham County pay $279,773.92, or 24.27 percent, toward the pay increases to cover the period from July 1 to Dec. 31.\nScott said Wednesday he didn’t believe a police merger agreement hinged on the county’s support of the salaries, but he did support contributing the additional funds.\n“We should support the salary increases, and that’s my recommendation on it,” Scott said. “I decided to put it on the agenda sooner rather than later. I don’t want to send a message to our combined metro force that the county is not on board with their pay increases. I think that would be an awful signal to send, and I hope my colleagues on the county commission would share my views.”\nAccording to agenda documents, the vote would not address covering salaries through 2016. Scott said the two governments will do an end-of-year review to determine how much the county should contribute in the coming year.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Chatham County Commission meeting\nWhen: 9:30 a.m. Friday\nWhere: County Commission Chambers, 2nd Floor, 124 Bull St.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:32:13.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
