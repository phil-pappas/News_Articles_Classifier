The confluence of challenging factors has contributed to the team's low offensive efficiency , which ranks 107 th out of 128 FBS teams and last in the Pac-12.\nOne of the ways Oregon State has hurt itself on offense has been through three-and-outs. For three consecutive games, the Beavers' first drive lasted three plays and resulted in a punt that quickly put the defense back on the field.\nBased on an evaluation by The Oregonian/OregonLive, Oregon State (2-4) has gone three-and-out more often and with more frequency than any other Pac-12 team.\nThe Beavers' offense has done so on 23 of 77 drives in six games this season, a conference-high 29.87 percent of drives. That is nearly four times per game. Colorado (3-4) ranks second worst in the Pac-12 with 23 three-and-out occurrences in 98 drives (23.47 percent).\nOregon State and Colorado play this Saturday at 7:30 p.m.\nFor the purposes of the analysis, three-and-outs did not count when the drive concluded with a field goal.\nOkay here are the links:\nBeavers rank last in Pac-12 in scoring offense, first in sacks allowed\nA sneak peek at Colorado, Oregon State's next opponent\nOregon State Beavers-Utah Utes kickoff set for 4 p.m . on Oct. 31\nWatch: Gary Andersen discusses addition of Gary Crowton as Beavers' offensive consultant\nWatch: Beavers coach Gary Andersen previews the Colorado Buffaloes\nOregon State finished last in The Oregonian/OregonLive Pac-12 Power Rankings\nOregon State Beavers freshman guard Derrick Bruce on skateboarding and his best nicknames\nAaron Fentress of CSNNW caught up with Carolina Panthers quarterback and OSU alum Derek Anderson\n-- Danny Moran\ndmoran@oregonian.com\n@DannyJMoran", "external_links": ["http://www.csnnw.com/beavers/Derek%20Anderson%20pulling%20for%20an%20Oregon%20State%20resurgence", "https://twitter.com/DannyJMoran/", "http://www.osubeavers.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30800&SPID=127145&SPSID=750123&DB_OEM_ID=30800", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/statistics/teamratings/_/sort/offEfficiency/tab/efficiency"], "published": "2015-10-20T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:54:43.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
