He's a former loose forward but has put on a lot more weight now.\" \nFeek added: \"In the World Cup it's been shown that if one pack doesn't get it quite right, anyone can get you, it's a real mental thing now. Argentina look really good as a collective.\" \nArgentina's participation in the Rugby Championship has also paid dividends, Feek said. \n\"It's understated really. Argentina have come into the World Cup under the radar a bit. They've got a well balanced side effectively playing against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa regularly.\" \nThey had also benefited from the \"influence of Ted (Graham Henry) and you can see that's coming through\". \n\"We're under no illusions that this week will be our biggest Test so far.\" \nMunster veteran Donnacha Ryan could only watch on in anguish as provincial locking partner Paul O'Connell saw his international career ended when he went off at half-time of the France game with an injured hamstring. \nBut Ryan will be in the running for a starting spot against Argentina in the absence of skipper O'Connell. \n\"We haven't played Argentina as much as we would have France,\" Ryan said. \n\"They're going to be a very tough side, and they're probably the most physical side in the competition so we're going to have to really be on our game. \n\"They were leading New Zealand for a large part of that game,\" he said of the Pumas' Pool C opener. \n“Up until 67 minutes they were three points ahead and it finished up pretty tight. I thought they were pretty unlucky. \n“If they’re pushing the world champions that close they're not too far off it.” \nRyan said Argentina had “very aggressive forwards... and explosive backs, not afraid to tap and go and keep the pace quick”. \n“It’s a massive challenge for us and we'll have to be on our toes this weekend.” \nCrashing out to Wales at the 2011 World Cup quarter-final was a lesson the Irish team had taken on board but not one on which it had dwelled, Ryan added. \n“You take those experiences with you. It's up to the guys that they learn from those experiences,” he said. \n“It’s important to be focused on the job but you realise that you take that bit of experience from back then to use it for the betterment of this weekend.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:32:17.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
