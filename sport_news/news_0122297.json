His 2-yard TD flip to Caleb Bluiett with 13:52 left in the fourth quarter made it 24-10. \nOklahoma responded with a long touchdown drive capped by Samaje Perine's 1-yard touchdown run to cut it to 24-17 with 8:00 minutes left. \nOklahoma got the ball back with 6:05 left, but two sacks, the last by Naashon Hughes and Poona Ford, forced a punt. The Longhorns then killed the clock, with Heard providing the final two first downs. \nTexas is now 6-2 since 1989 in Red River games in which it was unranked and the Sooners were ranked. \nNO. 1 OHIO STATE 49, MARYLAND 28 \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Cardale Jones threw two touchdown passes, J.T. Barrett scored three times and Ohio State remained unbeaten — and mostly underwhelming — with victory over Maryland. \nEzekiel Elliott had two touchdowns for the Buckeyes (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten), who were tied 21-21 in the third quarter before shaking free of the Terrapins (2-4, 0-2) and extending the nation's longest winning streak to 19. Ohio State has won 26 straight regular-season conference games. \nOhio State coach Urban Meyer juggled his quarterbacks, using Jones to start drives and Barrett to finish them. Jones threw a 19-yard TD pass to Braxton Miller and connected on a 48-yarder to Jalin Marshall. Outscored 73-6 the past two weeks, the Terrapins put up a fight amid speculation about coach Randy Edsall's future. Maryland quarterback Perry Hills ran for 170 yards and two TDs. \nNO. 2 TCU 52, KANSAS STATE 45 \nMANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Trevone Boykin threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns, the second a 55-yard strike to Josh Doctson with 1:10 left in the game, and TCU rallied from a big halftime deficit to beat Kansas State. \nBoykin also ran for 124 yards and two scores for the Horned Frogs (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who trailed 35-17 at the break. Aaron Green added 124 yards and two touchdowns rushing, while Doctson caught eight passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns. \nNone was bigger than his catch-and-run just 30 seconds after Jack Cantele had connected on a 37-yard field goal for Kansas State (3-2, 0-2) to knot the game 45-all. \nThe Wildcats had won 49 straight games when leading at halftime before last week's loss at Oklahoma State. Now, coach Bill Snyder's crew has lost two in a row. \nNO. 3 BAYLOR 66, KANSAS 7 \nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Seth Russell threw three touchdown passes, Shock Linwood ran for 135 yards and a score, and Baylor romped past Kansas. \nRussell threw for 246 yards, all in the first half. Two of the TD strikes went to Corey Coleman, pushing his nation-leading total to 13, and the other to 6-foot-7, 410-pound tight end LaQuan McGowan, helping the Bears (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) to a 52-7 halftime lead. \nThe Bears piled up 644 yards despite playing backups the entire second half. Second-string quarterback Jarrett Stidham was 9 of 10 for 217 yards and two touchdowns. \nFreshman Ryan Willis threw for 158 yards and a score in his first start for Kansas (0-5, 0-2), but he also had an interception and lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. \nNO. 6 CLEMSON 43, GEORGIA TECH 24 \nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — Deshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes, Wayne Gallman ran for two scores and Clemson surged past Georgia Tech. \nOn the same soggy field where the Tigers (5-0, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) outlasted Notre Dame24-22 last week, they made quick work of the Yellow Jackets (2-4, 0-3). \nGallman ran for 115 yards, including a 66-yard touchdown run on the game's third play. Watson passed for 265 yards and had touchdown throws of 29 and 8 yards to tight end Jordan Leggett. \nGeorgia Tech has four straight for the first time since 1996. Clemson held the Yellow Jackets to 71 yards rushing — its lowest total in coach Paul Johnson's eight seasons. \nNO. 7 LSU 45, SOUTH CAROLINA 24 \nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Leonard Fournette had an 87-yard touchdown run, Brandon Harris passed for a career-best 228 yards, and LSU beat South Carolina in a game moved to Tiger Stadium because of flooding in South Carolina. \nFournette finished with a season-low 158 yards on 20 carries in three quarters. Freshman Derrius Guice rushed for 161 yards and a TD, fellow running back Darrel Williams scored twice and the Tigers (5-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) piled up 396 yards rushing. \nTravin Dural had 109 yards receiving for LSU, highlighted by a 62-yard TD catch. Malachi Dupre also had a touchdown reception. \nWith quarterback Lorenzo Nunez nursing a sore shoulder, Perry Orth started for South Carolina (2-4, 0-4). He passed for 200 yards and two TDs. Rashad Fenton returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. \nNO. 8 ALABAMA 27, ARKANSAS 14 \nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Calvin Ridley caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from Jake Coker and Alabama rode its swarming defense to a victory over Arkansas. \nStymied by early mistakes, the Crimson Tide (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) scored 24 points over the final 17 minutes after trailing the Razorbacks (2-4, 1-2) at the half. \nThe Tide held Alex Collins to 26 rushing yards and added three sacks and an interception. \nCoker threw two interceptions on deep balls in the first half, but finished 24 of 33 for 262 yards with two touchdowns. Derrick Henry ran for 95 yards on 27 carries and set an Alabama record with a touchdown in his 11th straight game. Reggie Ragland had a sack, two quarterback hurries and a forced fumble. \nNO. 18 MICHIGAN 38, NO. 13 NORTHWESTERN 0 \nANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Jehu Chesson returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown and Michigan scored on offense and defense to build a four-touchdown lead by halftime. \nThe Wolverines (5-1, 2-0 Big Ten) have won five straight since their opening loss at Utah under coach Jim Harbaugh, building momentum going into a showdown at home next week against No. 4 Michigan State. \nThe Wildcats (5-1, 1-1) were giving up a nation-low seven points a game and gave that up in the first 13 seconds. They allowed a season-high 21 points in the first quarter alone and struggled on offense, too. Michigan has shut out three straight opponents for the first time since 1980. \nThe Wolverines scored TDs on a kickoff return, interception and offense for the first time since 1991 at Boston College, according to STATS. \nNO. 14 MISSISSIPPI, NEW MEXICO STATE 3 \nOXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Chad Kelly threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns to lead Mississippi. \nKelly, who came into the day leading the Southeastern Conference in passing, has topped 300 yards in four of his six games. He completed 24 of 33 throws. \nLaquon Treadwell caught eight passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns, including one on a spectacular one-handed grab down the right sideline. \nThe Rebels (5-1) finished with 665 yards of total offense. Eugene Brazley ran for a team-high 98 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown. New Mexico State is 0-5. \nNO. 15 NOTRE DAME 41, NAVY 24 \nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — C.J. Prosise ran for 129 yards and three touchdowns, two after Navy turnovers, and Notre Dame beat the Midshipmen. \nNavy rallied to tie it at 21 late in the second quarter on fullback Quentin Ezell's TD runs of 45 and 22 yards after quarterback Keenan Reynolds went down with a leg injury. \nBut Justin Yoon's 52-yard field goal to close the first half and Prosise's two touchdowns early in the second half gave the Irish (5-1) a 17-point lead. \nNavy (4-1) entered the game tied for best in the nation with one turnover, but had two Saturday. Chris Swain fumbled at the Navy 7 in the second quarter and linebacker Jaylon Smith recovered. On the second-half kickoff, Dishan Romine fumbled at the 26 and Devin Butler recovered. \nTENNESSEE 38, NO. 19 GEORGIA 31 \nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Joshua Dobbs threw for 312 yards, ran for 118 more and accounted for five touchdowns and Tennessee overcame a 21-point deficit to beat Georgia. \nGeorgia (4-2, 1-2 Southeastern Conference) lost star running back Nick Chubb to a left knee injury on the first play from scrimmage. \nGeorgia's Reggie Davis scored on a 70-yard punt return and 48-yard catch, but dropped a potential tying 56-yard pass with less than 4 minutes left. The Bulldogs got to Tennessee's 27 in the final seconds, but Brian Randolph broke up Greyson Lambert's pass to Malcolm Mitchell in the end zone. \nDobbs was 25 of 42 with three touchdown passes for Tennessee (3-3, 1-2). He ran for two touchdowns, including a 5-yarder that broke a 31-all tie with 5:48 left. \nNO. 21 OKLAHOMA ST. 33, WEST VIRGINIA 26, OT \nMORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) — Backup quarterback J.W. Walsh scored on a 2-yard run in overtime and No. 21 Oklahoma State held West Virginia scoreless on its possession in the extra period. \nIt marked the third straight close finish for the Cowboys (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who won their two previous conference games on last-minute field goals. \nSkyler Howard brought West Virginia from 15 points down with a 3-yard scoring run with 2:44 left to send the game into overtime tied at 26. \nOklahoma State's running game was ineffective in regulation, but five straight rushes in overtime moved the ball to the 2, and Walsh took it in from there. \nWest Virginia (3-2, 0-2) advanced to the 4 on its overtime possession, but Howard threw incomplete in the end zone on fourth-and-goal. \nNO. 22 IOWA 29, ILLINOIS 20 \nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Jordan Canzeri ran for 256 yards on a school-record 43 carries and Iowa held off Illinois for its sixth straight victory. \nC.J. Beathard had 200 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Hawkeyes (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten). They've already taken down four Power Five opponents heading into next week's game against No. 13 Northwestern. \nCanzeri's 75-yard touchdown run put Iowa ahead 23-13 late in the third quarter. Geronimo Allison pulled Illinois back within three on a 53-yard reception, but freshman Ke'Shawn Vaughn's fumble with 3:09 left doomed the Illini. Wes Lunt threw for 317 yards and a touchdown for Illinois (4-2, 1-1). \nNO. 24 TOLEDO 38, KENT STATE 7 \nTOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — Terry Swanson ran for 161 yards and a touchdown and Kareem Hunt had two scores in leading No. 24 Toledo to a 38-7 win over Kent State on Saturday. \nToledo got off to a shaky start, but remained undefeated at 5-0, 2-0 in the Mid-American Conference. Kent State is 2-4, 1-1. \nDiontae Johnson took the opening kickoff 89 yards for an apparent score for Toledo (5-0, 2-0 Mid-American), but the play was nullified by a penalty. After a three-and-out, Toledo's fourth-down snap sailed through the end zone and Kent State (2-4, 1-1) recovered for its only points of the day. \nToledo took over from there, and led 24-7 at the half. Swanson carried 16 times, and Hunt had 16 carries for 85 yards. Rockets quarterback Phillip Ely was 19 for 32 for 205 yards and two touchdowns. \nNO. 25 BOISE STATE 41, COLORADO STATE 10 \nFORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — Thomas Sperbeck caught two long touchdown passes and Jeremy McNichols scored his 13th and 14th TDs of the season, leading Boise State past Colorado State. \nAmong Brett Rypien's 339 yards passing was a beautiful 85-yard scoring strike to McNichols, who also caught a 53-yard touchdown pass from fellow wide receiver Shane Williams-Rhodes on a trick play. \nMcNichols, who leads the FBS in TDs, scored on a 56-yard scamper, but was knocked from the game on a 1-yard TD run late in the third quarter and didn't return. \nThe Broncos (5-1, 2-0 Mountain West) jumped out to a quick 17-0 lead before the Rams (2-4, 0-2) had even moved the chains and Boise State was never seriously threatened. \nSperbeck finished with five catches for 178 yards, all in the first half. McNichols had 104 yards on 17 carries and caught six passes for 77 yards. \nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:56:11.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
