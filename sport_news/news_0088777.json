Jacob deGrom, Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard will all be fully rested for the opening three games. \nDuda doubled twice and Travis d’Arnaud also homered as the Mets won their fifth NL pennant. Bartolo Colon pitched 1 1-3 scoreless innings for his first playoff win since 2001, for Cleveland at Seattle. The 14 years, 12 days between postseason victories for the 42-year-old set a new major league record. \nIn Toronto, Marco Estrada restricted Kansas City to one hit over the first seven innings to steer the Blue Jays to a 7-1 win against the Royals. \nYordano Ventura will start for the defending AL champions tomorrow in Game 6 against Toronto’s big-money signing David Price, the Game 2 loser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:56:36.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
