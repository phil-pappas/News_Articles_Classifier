Striker Christian Benteke headed in to give Liverpool the lead at Anfield and put Klopp on course for his first win. But Saints forward Sadio Mane made it 1-1 when he found the equaliser late in the game. “It’s only a goal, only a game of football. It’s like it’s the last thing in your life and we have to calm this down,” Klopp was quoted as saying by the BBC.\n“I don’t understand this pressure but the guys feel it. I hope I’m not the only person in the stadium who thought ‘this is not the end of the world’. We can work on this,” the 48-year-old said. The German, who replaced Brendan Rodgers as manager earlier this month, believes he has seen signs of progression in his players. “I saw development, I saw the next step, but at the end we are disappointed because of the result,” the former Borussia Dortmund manager said.\n“The problem is the other teams don’t wait for us – they want to win, they want to beat us.” Klopp will get his next chance to register his first win as Liverpool boss against Bournemouth at Anfield in the fourth round of the League Cup on Wednesday. “Football is not a fairytale. Sometimes we write stories like this but today it didn’t happen,” he said. “We can change a lot of things if it’s necessary but not all things will work from the start. If you work something you are not 100 percent better the next day,” Klopp said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:38:23.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
