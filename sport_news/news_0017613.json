The Tar Heels have an explosive offense and are expected to be a big challenge for the Demon Deacons. \nBefore we look ahead, lets look back: \nThe Demon Deacons got their first A-C-C win of the season last week at Boston College. They did it without scoring a single touchdown. This image says it all: \nThe pile is one place. The ball is not in that place \nThese 10 Things: Wake Forest, Boston College brings us to a low point \nWake beat BC 3-0 and it was ugly down to the final seconds. \nLast season, Virginia Tech head coach, Frank Beamer looked jubilant when regulation against Wake ended scoreless. The final score in that one was 6-3. The Deacs won in the worst double overtime game we've seen in a while. \nI know, a win is a win, and Wake fans will take it. If you can beat a team without finding the endzone, more power to you.
