Ohio State (5-0): Beat Indiana, 34-27. Saturday: vs. Maryland. If you have that running back, it might not matter who's the quarterback. Won at Maryland last year, 52-24.\n2. Michigan State (5-0): Beat Purdue, 24-21. Saturday: at Rutgers. Hasn't looked as imposing since beating Oregon. Beat Rutgers last year at home, 45-3.\n3. Texas Christian (5-0): Beat Texas, 50-7. Saturday: at Kansas State. OK, so maybe Texas isn't Texas Tech. Beat Kansas State by 21 last year at home.\n4. Baylor (4-0): Beat Texas Tech, 63-35. Saturday: at Kansas. Over-under could be triple figures. Which also might be the point spread.\nMore coverage Latest college sports videos SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise 5. Louisiana State (5-0): Beat Eastern Michigan, 44-22. Saturday: at South Carolina. First meeting since 2008. Will try not to be looking ahead to Florida.\n6. Florida State (4-0): Beat Wake Forest, 24-16. Saturday: vs. Miami. Has beaten Miami five straight times. So whatever happened to wide right? Or even left?\n7. Clemson (4-0): Beat Notre Dame, 24-22. Saturday: vs. Georgia Tech. Home team has won nine of the last 10 meetings. Last year, the Tigers lost, 28-6, in Atlanta.\n8. Florida (4-0): Beat Mississippi, 38-10. Saturday: at Missouri. How 'bout them Gators? Lost at home to Missouri last year, 42-13. In 2013, lost by 36-17 in Columbia.\n9. Utah (4-0): Idle. Saturday: vs. California. Last met in 2012, when Utes won, 49-27, at home. Cal, led by QB Jared Goff, is also unbeaten.\n10. Notre Dame (4-1): Lost at Clemson, 24-22. Saturday: vs. Navy. Tough spot, with Southern Cal up next. Has beaten Navy four straight. Midshipmen are unbeaten.\nNext five: Mississippi (4-1), Alabama (4-1), Texas A&M (5-0), Oklahoma (4-0) and Northwestern (5-0).\nMICHAEL JACK'S FRAUD FIVE:\nGeorgia: When it's supposed to be your year, you can still maybe be losing at home to Alabama, which was an underdog for first time since like Bear Bryant. But 38-10 seems excessive.\nMississippi: It's OK to lose at Florida. But again, perhaps not by 38-10.\nUCLA: Probably not OK to lose at home as double-digit favorite by 15 to Arizona State team that just got clubbed by 28 at home by USC.\nTexas: Definitely not OK to lose 50-7 to TCU, even in Fort Worth. Holy Darrell Royal! And was a Longhorn player really retweeting at halftime about transferring to Texas A&M?\nMiami: Shouldn't be losing by 12 at Cincinnati as a touchdown favorite.\nDishonorable mention: Wisconsin shouldn't be losing at home to Iowa, and scoring six points in the process. And Arizona shouldn't be losing by 55-17 at Stanford, the week after losing, 56-30, at home to UCLA. Somebody might want to explain defense to Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez.", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=collegegearArticle&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2Fpages%2FCOLLEGE"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:57:17.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
