Once NASCAR gets a chance, it should take Brad Keselowski for a ride at Dover. The objective: Show him the new, enlarged restart zone.\nAdChoices Stockcar racing officials on Thursday announced a doubling of the zone's length for Sunday's schedule rade, allowing a bit of wiggle room for drivers when a race under caution returns to green.\nMORE: Tony Stewart's retirement options | Watching raindrops fall at Dover | Facing Chase elimination\nAs is the sport's wont, it is making changes on the fly regarding this rule. Basically, drivers cannot gain position during a restart. And that's what got Keselowski in trouble at New Hampshire.\nRunning second at the time, he passed race leader Greg Biffle and was ahead of him when his car hit the restart zone exit. Result: For the first time, NASCAR enforced the restart rule during a race. Keselowski was ordered to make a pass down pit road, with its slow speed, to pay for accelerating past a race leader.\nKeselowski was not happy.\n\"It's a pretty basic understanding. It's an entertainment sport, not a fair sport, but we had a great car,\" Keselowski said after the Sylvania 300.\n\"I had the chance to do something again for the first time. The first person to ever be penalized for jumping a restart when I didn't pass anyone, so that's a new one.\"\nThe penalty dropped Keselowski from the front of the field to the middle of the pack. He finished 12th at Loudon and enters the third Chase race in eighth place.\nMORE: What drivers must do to survive Chase cut | Odds on Jimmie Johnson | Can anyone beat Gibbs drivers?\nBiffle defended Keselowski, but the long arm of NASCAR law had graphic evidence to support its case. When it announced a crackdown on restarts, NASCAR said it would add video cameras to its enforcement arsenal to review observers' reports against replays.\nWhile Keselowski burned, NASCAR fired up ideas. And doubling the size of the restart zone at Dover, to 140 feet, makes sense. It doesn't take long for a Sprint Cup car to blow through 70 feet of track, even on a restart. Now, 140 feet could give a driver with an itchy gas-pedal foot a chance to adjust. Quickly.\nIt's not always shenanigans. Sometimes, as Denny Hamlin noted recently, the leader might not floor it as fast as the cars behind him when a race goes green. A longer restart zone allows for adjustments.\nSo if he and a rules official go for that ride at Dover, Keselowski will be able to see the red stripe on the track wall that indicates the start of the zone, and the double red stripe where it ends.\nAny questions can be handled then and there. All drivers will get a reminder at the final prerace meeting.\nLength of the restart zone will be determined at each track. Suffice it to say every driver will know the dimensions and won't have to read between the lines.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/article/4656731-nascar-odds-dover-betting-lines-2015-aaa-400-favorites-jimmie-johnson-kevin-harvick", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656620-nascar-sprint-cup-chase-new-hampshire-sylvania-300-standings-winners-losers-hamlin-harivck-kenseth-busch-dover-aaa-400-schedule", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-09-30/nascar-chase-clinching-scenarios-dover-harvick-earnhardt-busch", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-01/nascar-sprint-cup-dover-aaa-400-hurricane-joaquin-delays-rain-qualifying", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656908-tony-stewart-retirement-plans-racing-sprint-cars-indy-500-f1-tv-stewart-haas-racing", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-09-30/nascar-dover-preview-fantasy-stats-harvick-busch-earnhardt-facing-chase-elimination-scenarios"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:48:46.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
