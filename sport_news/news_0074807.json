In most cases in the city the snatchers stole the mangalasutram leaving victims with minor injuries and shock. Alerting the cops immediately can help find the snatchers, said West Zone DCP A. Venkateshwar Rao.\nUnlike earlier, where snatchers attacked women walking through lonely areas, snatchers are now attacking women in front of their homes. They have also changed their modus operandi by approaching victims in the guise of strangers asking for address.\n“I thought women are attacked only on the roads. When a stranger asked me for an address, I thought he was harmless. But to my shock he snatched my gold chain weighing three tolas,” said Revati from Neredmet.\nIn another incident in Jubilee hills area on Tuesday, the mother-in-law of a former minister was attacked when she was standing outside a temple.\n“There was parking on the temple premises, but to save time I came on to the road. My car was coming and then they snatched my chain. Though I suffered an injury on the hand what worried me most is that I lost my mangalasutra,” said Satyavati, mother-in-law of former minister M. Venkateshwar Rao.\nMalleswari, a maid from Jubilee hills was attacked while she was on way to drop her daughter at school. When she was about to cross the road along with her daughter snatchers grabbed her gold chain weighing around 1.5 tolas.\nPolice say that women should immediately alert Dial 100 instead of waiting for the police to come to the spot.\n“In most cases the victims report to the police after an hour or so. This hinders investigation. If reported immediately chances of finding the criminals are better. Instead of going to a police station the victim should dial 100 immediately and we will alert our men in the area and patrol vehicles,” said DCP A. Venkateshwar Rao.\n4 robbed on city streets\nChain-snatchers went on a robbing spree in the city on Saturday. Four women were attacked and they lost jewellery weighing around 13 tolas.
