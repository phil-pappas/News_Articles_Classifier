Mark Lathrop / Sierra Pacific Industries. One of California’s largest logging companies, which owns timberland, operates two sawmills and employs about 300 people in Tuolumne County, has been recognized for helping restore forest-dwelling fishers east of Chico. Fishers have been hunted for their fur pelts since the 18th century, and they lost more than 250 square miles of habitat in the 2013 Rim Fire, according to state and federal Fish and Wildlife agencies. They have recommended the species be listed as threatened. Sierra Pacific Industries, based in Anderson, is billed as a forest products company that owns and manages close to 1.9 million acres of timberland in California and Washington. The company owns about 300,000 acres in Tuolumne, Calaveras and Amador counties. About 16,000 acres of SPI’s timberlands were damaged in the Rim Fire. No SPI land was damaged in the Butte Fire in September. The company’s sawmills are in Standard and Chinese Camp. Fishers are mammals in a family that includes weasels, mink, martens and otters, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a partner in the project with Sierra Pacific Industries. A grown fisher, long bodied and short-legged with a bushy tail, is about the same size as a large, domestic cat, with light brown to black-brown fur. “The fisher’s range was reduced dramatically in the 1800s and early 1900s through trapping, predator and pest control, and alterations of forested habitats brought about by logging, fire, urbanization and farming,” federal Fish and Wildlife staff state on a Pacific Southwest Region web page. The population is threatened now by rodenticide used in illegal marijuana grows that overlap fisher habitat in the Klamath Mountains and southern Sierra Nevada. In spite of their name, fishers are not known to hunt or eat fish, according to the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife. Fishers do stalk, kill and eat hares, rabbits, rodents, birds and porcupines. They also eat berries, nuts and insects. The species name may have started with French trappers more than two centuries ago, who called individual European polecat pelts “fichet,” pronounced fee-shay. Federal Fish and Wildlife staff have proposed listing the West Coast fisher population as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In June, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife recommended state Endangered Species Act protection for the Pacific fisher in the southern Sierra Nevada portion of its range. In the meantime, Sierra Pacific Industries, state and federal fish and wildlife departments and researchers from North Carolina State University are tracking about 40 fishers with radio collars released over a three-year period on SPI lands. The project area is on a 160,000-acre tract of Sierra Pacific Industries property east of Chico, Mark Pawlicki, SPI’s director of corporate affairs and sustainability, said. Some fishers born in the project area have matured to the point where they are now reproducing, according to SPI. The project partners were awarded the Leadership in Conservation Award at the Sustainable Forestry Initiative 2015 Annual Conference in Olympic Valley near North Lake Tahoe. Sustainable Forestry Initiative is billed as an independent nonprofit organization that works with conservation groups, communities, resource professionals, landowners and other organizations and people committed to healthy forests, responsible purchasing and sustainable communities. Sierra Pacific Industries counts itself among the largest lumber producers in the United States.
