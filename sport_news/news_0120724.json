Jason Cowan / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Last Friday vs. Summerville, Bret Harte began a drive — early in the fourth quarter, tied at 22 — with most of their players feet, on offense, touching their goal line. Then, they methodically marched down the field. The Bullfrogs would take a 29-22 lead following an 18-play, 99-yard drive that took about 8 minutes off the clock. They went on to win 29-28,and earn their first Mother Lode League victory for Bret Harte in three and a half years. Bullfrog head coach Casey Kester said the drive is among the best he has seen, and something that can turn around a season. “Summerville had us backed up inside the 1-yard line. Most of the time, we get five or six-yards and try to give the punter some room,” said Kester. “This was like the turning point of the season. Our backs were against the wall, we didn’t give up, marched down the field, beat the hell out of the other team and got in.” They maneuvered down the field without throwing a pass and without full health from Mike Ziehlke. The quarterback dislocated his right shoulder — on his throwing hand — on the long drive that gave Bret Harte the lead. “I played the rest of the fourth quarter on it last week. We had the 99-yard drive and we had the comeback,” said Ziehlke. Kester took it easy on his quarterback who did not practice this week though he says the shoulder feels fine. Regardless of how much time Ziehlke is on the field, Kester says he is confident in his alternatives — Jim Brechtel and Joey Kraft — who will both see time at quarterback Friday in different situations. “I’ve got two quarterbacks who was pushing Ziehlke very hard all year. Both of those guys have been getting all the reps (this week in practice) and have been doing very well,” said Kester. “They’re making all the throws, making all the reads. They’re a little bit rusty because they haven’t had all the reps that he has had, but they’re ready to step in.” Tonight A victory at Linden tonight would give Bret Harte its second MLL victory — a milestone reached just two times since 2007. “This could be the best team Bret Harte has seen in a while,” said Ziehlke. “I started watching Bret Harte seven years ago with my cousins. They weren’t good then.” To do that, Kester says ball control is imperative — especially in the offense that Bret Harte employs which exposes the football more than traditional offenses. “We’ve been really working on ball control with the new piece of equipment, the blaster machine. Normally we’ve been using it every single day, now we’re using it every other day,” said Kester. “It it paying off. We run a high risk offense, so we’re always going to have a fumble ratio.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:02:32.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
