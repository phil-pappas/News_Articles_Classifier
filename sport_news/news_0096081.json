Because of those political tensions, Mkhitaryan feared visa problems or — at worst — arrest as soon as he set foot on the tarmac in Azerbaijan.\nDespite assurances from Azerbaijan’s foreign ministry and pledges of support from European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, Dortmund decided safety concerns left it no choice but to avoid the risk completely.\n“Based on the situation,” Mkhitaryan’s teammate Roman Weidenfeller said this week, “it is better to leave Henrikh at home.”\nWhat might have seemed a shocking turn of events was in fact merely part of life for soccer in Europe, where local and national politics sometimes dictate when — and even if — athletes can compete. In the last year, UEFA has taken pains to separate Russian and Ukrainian clubs in European competitions after their countries went to war, and this week problems even spilled into the stands, where four black fans were attacked by Ukrainian supporters for what appeared to be their mere presence for Chelsea’s game at Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday.\nPhoto And Dortmund could face another situation similar to the Mkhitaryan case in the near future: Another of its players, Adnan Januzaj, received death threats last year after he announced that he would play internationally for Belgium instead of Kosovo, where he was born, or Serbia, for whom he was also eligible. News media reports in Belgium and Serbia at the time said the 20-year-old Januzaj was warned never to set foot in Balkan territory again.\nSeveral Balkan teams remain alive in the Europa League, as does Dortmund, which moved into first place in its group with its win over Qabala.\n“It’s a region of crisis,” Dortmund’s chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke, said Wednesday ahead of the trip to Baku. “Especially the relationship between these two nations. We spoke to Henrik and we think it’s best for everyone. In may not be a flawless democracy, but there are more of those in this region.”\n“He felt somewhat uncomfortable in the situation,” Watzke added. “This is the best solution for all sides.”\nThe decision robbed Dortmund of one of its most dangerous attackers; Mkhitaryan had 10 goals and 8 assists in 16 appearances this season.\nMoments before Thursday’s game, Mkhitaryan tweeted a photo of the match with a simple message: “Didn’t travel with our boys, but will support from home!” He tweeted his congratulations to Dortmund’s players on their victory shortly after the final whistle.\nIt was not the first time a big club made a curious roster decision for a game in Eastern Europe. Last season, Tottenham Hotspur left five black players at home for an important game at Partizan Belgrade. Tottenham’s manager, Mauricio Pochettino, said the choices were made only for “ footballing reasons ,” but few English fans had forgotten the racial abuse that rained on one of the players, defender Danny Rose, when he played for England in the country two years earlier.\nRacism did rear its head at one match this week. On Thursday, UEFA said that it would open disciplinary proceedings against Dynamo Kiev after four black fans were attacked in the club’s stadium during a Champions League match against Chelsea on Tuesday.\nVideo of the attack was posted to YouTube and broadcast widely in the European news media; it shows Dynamo fans attacking the four men , who were forced to try to escape with little or no help from stadium security officials. The antidiscrimination group Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE), which tracks racism in European soccer, said it had sent an observer report to UEFA on the incident.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/HenrikhMkh/status/657211218567016448", "http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/512135/Footballing-reasons-leave-FIVE-key-players-out-of-Tottenham-s-Europa-League-squad", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/23SOCCERweb2/23SOCCERweb2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/adnan-januzaj-has-received-death-threats-from-angry-fans-after-choosing-to-play-for-belgium-9595662.html", "http://www.uefa.org/disciplinary/index.html#post_159128", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyEGXjYe9qU", "https://twitter.com/farenet/status/656793312796549121", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/23SOCCERweb2/23SOCCERweb2-blog427.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:28:45.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
