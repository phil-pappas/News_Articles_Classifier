The club came close in the 2013-14 season to winning the league for the first time since 1990 but it was way off the pace last season.\nLiverpool's ownership group says \"although this has been a difficult decision, we believe it provides us with the best opportunity for success on the pitch.\"\nLiverpool is 10th with 12 points from eight matches this season.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
