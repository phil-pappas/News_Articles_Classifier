They proved they're aiming for that goal with a dominant 49-0 victory over Drury on Saturday. \nAfter a season-opening victory over Mount Greylock, Monument (2-4) lost to Taconic, Wahconah, Hoosac Valley and Pittsfield. Now, after the win over the Blue Devils, they close the regular season at rival Lee on Friday night before two consolation games. \n\"We want to finish with a winning record,\" Monument coach Chris D'Aniello said. \"That's our goal. It wasn't too many years ago that Monument couldn't win a game. Having a winning season would be a success.\" \nIn the victory over Drury (0-7), Mike Buffoni rushed for 142 yards and two touchdowns on six carries while Cam Dargie finished with 56 yards rushing and a score. Branden Perry (receiving and interception return) and Cayvon Truden (kick return and interception) contributed two touchdowns apiece for the Spartans. \nFor Drury, Jamal Beda rushed for 66 yards while Sutye Vilyavahn added 31 yards on the ground. Advertisement \nBuffoni scored on his first touch of the game, a 74-yard scamper that gave Monument a 6-0 advantage. After rushing for over 1,200 yards last season, Buffoni missed a few games during the middle of this season with an injury before returning as the team's fullback instead of tailback. \nCam Dargie doubled the Monument lead with a 2-yard touchdown run later in the first quarter before freshman quarterback Caleb Carlson hit Perry for an 83-yard touchdown. Perry, the team's starting quarterback to start the season, moved back to the wide receiver position he played in 2014 as Carlson got the start. \nThe Spartans led, 28-0, at halftime after Buffoni scored on a 30-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter. \n\"We've had a tough schedule with no reprieve,\" D'Aniello said. \"We tried to be competitive, but it was tough. We're just trying to get better every week, and today it all came together.\" \nMonument scored three times to open the third quarter without running a play on offense. Truden returned the opening second-half kickoff 75 yards for a score before intercepting a pass and taking it back 50 yards to give the Spartans a 42-0 advantage. \nIt was then Perry who intercepted a pass on Drury's very next play, returning it 10 yards for a touchdown and a 49-0 Spartan lead only 15 seconds after their previous score. \nMonument plays the aforementioned game against Lee on Friday at 7 p.m. while Drury goes on the road to renew its rivalry with Hoosac Valley on Saturday at 1 p.m. \n———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:29:59.185+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
