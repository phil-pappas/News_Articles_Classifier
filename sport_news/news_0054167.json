Credit: Jim Weber October 23, 2015 - Brighton's Breland Austin (center) is taken down quickly by Munford's Jake Wakefield on a pass play during the Region 8-5A championship in Brighton. (Jim Weber/The Commercial Appeal) Related Coverage White Station cruises; Brighton hands Munford first loss When Brighton's Malik Mathews scored the go-ahead touchdown with two minutes remaining, the Cardinals defense knew Munford would have to pass to beat them.\nThen sophomore defensive end Cameron John got a chance to do what he does best — get after the quarterback. John sprinted into the backfield for a sack on second down. Then on fourth-and-17, John gave Munford quarterback Jacob Ross little time to save the Cougars' undefeated season, sacking him to seal the 24-20 victory for No. 12 Brighton (8-1, 5-1 in Region 8-5A).\n\"We just tried to sack them every time,\" John said. \"We didn't want to let them throw it down the field and score a touchdown.\"\nScoring a touchdown might have been a tall task for No. 4 Munford (8-1, 5-1 in Region 8-5A) in that situation. The Cougars had only attempted three passes before the final two minutes of the game; none were completed.\n\"We were still worried about (Munford's passing game), but we got a few sacks that we hadn't gotten all night long,\" said Brighton head coach Robin Jacobs. \"I don't know if they got the ball off but one time. When they had to do nothing but pass, it was a different game.\"\nMidway through the fourth quarter, Brighton had just suffered its fourth turnover of its highly-anticipated game against its undefeated rival. The raucous home crowd was silenced as Munford looked to capitalize on its 20-10 lead with about eight minutes to go.\nThen Munford looked to end the game in one shot with a deep pass downfield. Brighton safety Deavius Terry intercepted Ross' pass, only his third attempt of the evening.\nTerry returned his interception 80 yards to the 10-yard line. Two plays later, sophomore Malik Jackson hit Austin Kelley in the corner of the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the lead to 20-17.\n\"We didn't panic on offense,\" Jacobs said. \"The return by Deavius was the turning point.\"\nBrighton's defense stood strong on the ensuing possession and forced a punt. The Cardinals followed with nine consecutive rushes; the final rush was a 2-yard carry by Malik Mathews across the goal line that gave his team a 24-20 lead with two minutes remaining.\n\"It's sort of ironic,\" Jacobs said. \"They had to go to the pass in the end, and we had to go to the run. We were comfortable running it. They weren't as comfortable passing it.\"\nZach Camp rushed for 109 yards for the Cardinals. Mathews added a receiving touchdown from Jackson in the third quarter.\nMidway through the game, Brighton was its own worst enemy. The Cardinals had two touchdowns reversed due to a penalty, a turnover on downs, and also fumbled inside the 5-yard line. They had also thrown three interceptions, including two to Munford safety Garrett Baugh.\n\"We knew it was going to be a hard-fought game,\" Jacobs said. \"This win means a lot to us. We were 2-8 last year. We've worked real hard. I'm just tickled to be where we're at.\"\nMunford found a lot of success on the ground throughout the night. The Cougars rushed the ball for 283 yards. Ross, Anthony Boley and Wilson Lowry each scored a touchdown.\n\"We knew we were going to give up some runs here and there, but we couldn't let them have a whole bunch of them,\" Jacobs said. \"Our defense bent, but it didn't break.\"\nNow with one week remaining in the regular season, Brighton needs a win at Bolton next week to win the Region 8-5A Championship.\n\"We want to be region champs,\" Jacobs said. \"It will be a lot better preparing for them than it would've been if we hadn't gotten that last touchdown.\"", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/200*159/525290.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/525290.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/532158.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*133/532158.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:43:34.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
