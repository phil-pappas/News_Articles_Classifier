The same could be said of the nation’s best individual performers. \nThe USA TODAY Sports Midseason All-America team recognizes the group of players from Power Five and Group of Five conferences who have excelled through the first seven weeks of the season. The team includes 25 players: 11 on offense, 11 on defense and three specialists. \nIt’s a list paced by LSU running back Leonard Fournette and TCU quarterback Trevone Boykin, the perceived frontrunners for this year’s Heisman Trophy. Boykin is one of three offensive skill players from the offense-first Big 12 Conference, joining teammate Josh Doctson and Baylor’s Corey Coleman. \nBaylor leads all teams with three selections, with Coleman joined by offensive tackle Spencer Drango and defensive tackle Andrew Billings. Another six teams have two picks: TCU, LSU, Stanford, Alabama, Texas A&M and Utah. \nGALLERY: Midseason All-Americans A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
