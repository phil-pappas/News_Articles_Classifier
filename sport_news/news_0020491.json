His streak included the greatest postseason romp by a running back in major college football history.\nBut this time a year ago, when the Buckeyes rolled into Happy Valley to take on Penn State, Elliott was a sophomore with just two career 100-yard games to his credit. He had been an understudy to Carlos Hyde in 2013, and he and a revamped offensive line still were in search of consistency.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! \n“This time last year, he was still becoming Ezekiel Elliott,” Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said in the lead-up to Saturday’s game. “In the playoffs — the Big Ten championship and final games — he became obviously one of the best backs in the country. His play without the ball has continued.”\nThat’s what sets Elliott apart in Meyer’s mind, what he does without the ball. When he threw out that platitude, he wanted it understood he wasn’t speaking simply of the 109 yards Elliott rushed for on 26 carries against Penn State a year ago, or the 696 he gained over the three postseason games.\n“You know, this game last year, it was one of the best games I’ve seen a tailback play without the ball,” Meyer said. “His blocking against a very good defense was outstanding.\n“He started to separate himself from a good player to a great player last year around this time.”\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nTwo games later, Elliott gained 154 yards in the team’s signature regular-season victory at Michigan State. Two games after that, Elliott stepped off to a modest 103 yards on 13 carries against Indiana and the streak was born.\nAlong the way, he has gained the respect of his teammates, from the linemen he is always crediting for paving his way, to the other skill players, such as receiver Michael Thomas.\nAnd it has been the breakaways, like an 85-yard run against Alabama and the successive 55-, 65- and 75-yard touchdown runs against Indiana two weeks, ago that have set him apart.\n“If you get him to the second level, he’s a great athlete and I feel like he’s the top running back in the country,” Thomas said.\ntmay@dispatch.com \n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:35:54.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
