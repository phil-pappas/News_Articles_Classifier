He has since played four international games, including a substitute appearance in the team’s 5-1 drubbing of Chad in an African Cup of Nations qualifier last month.\nTrezeguet is yet to make his debut with Anderlecht but he caused controversy after posting a doctored Instagram picture that blurred out the faces of female fans welcoming him to the club, prompting calls to heavily punish him.\nHe then apologized before appearing on the cover of the club’s magazine as part of a \"no to discrimination\" campaign.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T12:21:00.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
