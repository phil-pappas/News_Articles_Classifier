Speaking with Titans head coach Trorie Rickert, he said that it all comes down to the performance of the offensive line against the Skiers. “We had a really strong week of practice, and I am really happy with the way we’ve responded,” Rickert said. “The line is the key for us. We talked about that while watching film, and we stressed the importance of our line all week.” The line will have to open up holes for Jacx Power and Jacob Larsen, who will have to get the offense going on the ground against the Skiers. Defensively, Rickert said Aspen does similar things to Basalt, so the stout Titans defense will have to be schematically sound. “They like to use the play-action and run a bootleg off of it,” Rickert said. “And Aspen has a good fullback and running back, so we have to come up and hit them.” Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. Rams host Huskies Sitting at 3-2 (1-0) on the season, the Roaring Fork Rams will host the Battle Mountain Huskies (1-3, 0-1) tonight in Carbondale. The Rams look to build off of a 51-24 win over Aspen last week in which the Rams ran wild against the Skiers. Battle Mountain comes in heading in the opposite direction of the Rams, falling 24-7 to the Moffat County Bulldogs in Week 5. Bears-Warriors set for showdown The Rifle Bears and the Grand Junction Central Warriors head into tonight’s showdown at Bears Stadium sporting identical records at 4-1 overall. However, the Bears dropped their first game of the season in Week 5 to the Delta Panthers, 35-21, while the Warriors demolished the Steamboat Springs Sailors, 42-0. Despite the loss, the Bears will almost certainly come into tonight’s game looking to prove a point that they’re still one of the best teams in the state. A win against the Warriors in convincing fashion should do just that. Kickoff at Bears Stadium is set for 7 p.m. Demons look for first win Sitting at 0-5 on the year, the Glenwood Springs Demons will take to the road tonight to face the Eagle Valley Devils (4-1, 1-1). With a banged-up roster, tonight’s game won’t get any easier for the Demons, although quarterback Jake Townsley could return to the lineup to provide the Demons with a much-needed boost offensively. Cardinals travel to Cedaredge The young Grand Valley Cardinals team will travel to Cedaredge to take on the undefeated Bruins (5-0, 1-0). The Bruins have won their last two games by a combined score of 59-25. Leoray Hernandez, Jeffrey Holbrook, Jonathan Pena and Levi Nolan must come up big offensively to give the Cardinals a chance in this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:02:58.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
