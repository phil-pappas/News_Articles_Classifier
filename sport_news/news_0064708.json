The Rangers have not opened the season at home since 2007-08.\n\"I think it’s important to play well at home,\" said goalie Henrik Lundqvist, who will make his third start in four nights. \"You gain confidence when you win in front of your fans.\"\nThere is also the practical matter of the Rangers needing to play well at home in order to get off to their desired strong start. Including tonight, eight of their next 10 games are at the Garden.\nLast season, the Rangers went 25-11-5 at home but were only 6-5 at the Garden in their three playoff rounds, losing three games to the Lightning, including 2-0 defeats in both Games 5 and 7 of the Eastern Conference final.\n\"You want it to be a building where you feel confident,\" Lundqvist said.\n\"The only way to feel confident is to win.\"\nThere obviously is no banner to lift prior to tonight’s game, thus sparing the Blue Jackets from enduring the same lengthy, pregame ceremony the Rangers waited through before beating the Cup champion Blackhawks, 3-2, in Wednesday night’s opener. But the home opener will be marked by each Ranger being introduced individually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:37:20.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
