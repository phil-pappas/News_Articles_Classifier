Beathard in the second quarter for the only touchdown in the game and Iowa (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) beat a ranked opponent for the first time in its last 10 attempts. \nStave was intercepted twice by Iowa cornerback Desmond King and lost two fumbles, including midway through the fourth quarter on Iowa's 1-yard line. The Wisconsin quarterback tripped and lost the ball while attempting to hand off to freshman Taiwan Deal. Iowa's Faith Ekakitie recovered. \nWisconsin (3-2, 0-1) had its 10-game winning streak at Camp Randall Stadium snapped, and lost for only the eighth time in its last 79 home games dating to 2004. \nThe Badgers started their final drive on their 47 and drove to the Iowa 16, but Stave's fourth-down pass to Troy Fumagalli fell incomplete with 36 seconds to go. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:15:43.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
