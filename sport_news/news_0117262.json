The other was a garage break-in at nearby Oriole Circle. \nThe suspect in both cases is described as a tall, skinny male in a black hooded sweat shirt. \nThe suspect took cash from the house he broke into. He also tried stealing from cars parked in the neighborhood. \nSafety is something that's very important to Bruce Conley. He makes sure every door is locked in his house and his cars are kept safe in the garage at night. \n\"So maybe we're over doing it, but I've always felt safer that way, knowing that we're pretty well locked up at night,\" Conley said. \nConley lives right around the corner from the house where the suspect broke in. While he says the neighborhood is pretty safe, he still takes extra precautions. \n\"I've heard terrible stories of people who have been robbed, who have psychological problems afterward; the fear factor sets in,\" Conley said. \nPolice say burglaries are usually crimes of opportunity, but it's a rarity for people to actually see the suspect inside their home. \n\"If a person is looking for a crime of opportunity, they're generally going to wait until people aren't around because they don't want the police to be called and they want to be long gone before it's reported,\" David McIntire with the Sioux Falls Police Department said. \nPolice are advising residents to lock up vehicles, close garages and secure all home entrances. \n\"People should secure their property. It will protect them from most, in some cases all of these incidents,” McIntire said. \nConley said many other residents believe it's unlikely to be burglarized in such a safe neighborhood. \n\"It’s just that there's an attitude that, 'This can't happen to me.' It can, it does and it will,\" Conley said. \nPolice say crimes of opportunity can happen anywhere. People should always take extra caution, no matter where they live. \nPolice are still looking for the suspect. They say homeowners should call authorities if they see anyone suspicious trying door handles or loitering near cars. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
