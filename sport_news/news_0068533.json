Cal fell 40-24 at UCLA on Thursday night. \nCal has lost 11 straight games to USC (4-3, 2-2), which delivered its most impressive performance of a tumultuous season Saturday with a 42-24 thrashing of No. 3 Utah. \nThe Trojans had lost two in a row, including by a 41-31 margin at Notre Dame in their first game since coach Steve Sarkisian was fired, in part, because of alcohol issues.
