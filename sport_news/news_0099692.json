His opponent, Bill Haas, son of the US skipper, Jay Haas, grabbed the chance with both hands and took the hole and with it the match 2-Up. \n\nUS won the Presidents Cup again, but this time by the thinnest of margins possible. \n\n\"I am gutted,\" said Lahiri, who admitted that he just could not come to terms with the greens and putted the worst in his life. \n\nLahiri hit a superb third shot to within three feet and Kirk was at least 15 feet and he needed to hole it for a birdie to give himself an outside chance of halving the match, which at that stage was All Square. \n\nKirk holed the putt and then admitted, \"(I was) purely just thinking, make it (putt) for the halve. Obviously didn't expect Anirban to unfortunately miss that putt. Hate to see that. Just trying to hit it like any other putt, hit the line and roll it in.\" \n\nKirk's putt died perfectly into the hole from the right edge. And then Lahiri sent it to the right, it caught a big chunk of the lip and then came out. \n\nThe final putt could halved the match and given the Internationals one hand on the Cup, something that has not happened since 2003. \n\nSpeaking about it and whether he had rushed it, Lahiri said, \"No, not at all. I was pretty sure what the line was and I made a good stroke. But I think I did what I've done all week: Misread putts.\" \n\n\"I had Bubba Watson come up to me about a minute after we finished up and he said that he had done the same exact thing. Both of us thought -- I guess. I don't know about his putt. I didn't see it. It looked like right in to me. That's why I hit it. Went left to right and caught a big part of the lip. Spat it out,\" said Lahiri. \n\n\"In the end, it was not about letting myself down, but the whole team; the players, the captain and the vice-captain,\" he added. \n\nSunday's singles draw (Winners first): \n\nPatrick Reed (US) halved with Louis Oosthuizen (Int'l) \n\nAdam Scott (Int'l) beat Rickie Fowler (US) 6&5 \n\nDustin Johnson (US) beat Danny Lee (Int'l) 2&1 \n\nHideki Matsuyama (Int'l) beat J B Holmes (US) 1-Up \n\nWatson (US) halved with Thongchai Jaidee (Int'l) \n\nSteven Bowditch (Int'l) beat Jimmy Walker (US) 2-Up \n\nPhil Mickelson (US) beat Charl Schwartzel (Int'l) 5&4 \n\nChris Kirk (US) beat Anirban Lahiri (Int'l) 1-Up \n\nMarc Leishman (Int'l) beat Jordan Spieth (US) 1-Up \n\nZach Johnson (US) beat Jason Day (Int'l) 3&2 \n\nBranden Grace (Int'l) beat Matt Kuchar (US) 2&1 \n\nBill Haas (US) beat Sangmoon Bae (Int'l) 2-Up \n\nSession Score: 6-6; Total: US 15.5 Internationals 14.5. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:40:39.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
