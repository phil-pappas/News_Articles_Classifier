Since then, the group's bond has strengthened. \n\"These 13 seniors have been part of the same family of brothers all the way through,\" said head coach Dave Thompson. \n\"I think Siji's best ability is his ability to control the ball, and not just shoot it, but settle it and share with his teammates. He's obviously proven to be exceptionally gifted in that way.\" \n\"It's not just us two that carry the team,\" said senior midfielder Daniel Hedstrom. \"We have so many other weapons.\" \nHedstrom and Gonzalez often exchange passes on scoring runs, but being able to create offense with other players has helped just as much as the team's ability to relax and enjoy the game. \n\"They'll just be fooling around, but once you're on the field,\" Gonzalez said. \"They change.\" \nGonzalez has grown from a soft-spoken player to a vocal team leader, never losing his humility. \n\"I feel that they trust me so much,\" he said. \"I trust them even more since they're trusting me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:39:13.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
