And those lawsuits, even if their employer ends up being succesful at the end fo the day, take a lot of time, energy and money,\" Jean Bender, an attorney with Davenport, Evans, Hurwitz & Smith Law Firm, said. \nThursday, the Davenport-Evans Law Firm will be hosting a free event for area businesses answering questions concerning the law change. It will be at the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Sioux Falls from 7:30 a.m to noon. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
