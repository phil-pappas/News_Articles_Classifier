Kansas City's offense quickly dropped off, and that allowed Chicago to mount a comeback for its second straight last-minute win.\nCutler threw for 252 yards and two touchdowns, the first a 22-yard strike to Marquess Wilson with 3:05 left in the game. After the Bears forced a quick three-and-out, Cutler drove them inside the 10-yard line. He took a snap in the shotgun, dropped it, then spotted Forte in the end zone.\nThe Chiefs (1-4) tried a 66-yard field goal that came up short as time expired.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
