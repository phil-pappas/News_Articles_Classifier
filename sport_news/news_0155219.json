But first they had to check off their final road game of the season, a desultory affair that was played in front of what seemed to be only several hundred fans — and the radio broadcasters. The game was originally scheduled for 7 p.m., but with bad weather approaching, it was moved to noon, and very few fans rearranged their schedule to watch the worst team in baseball play the Mets. SEPT. 27, 2015 The Mets were resting most of their regular players in preparation for the playoffs, adding to the quiet, spring training feel to the game, which the Phillies won, 3-0. “It’s a little odd,” David Wright said. “But I’ve been through things like this before where bad weather, and time changes make things a little more awkward.” Wright did not play, in order to rest his back, and neither did Yoenis Cespedes, who was struck on the left hand with a pitch in Wednesday’s sloppy game and sustained bruises to his middle and ring fingers. Cespedes told Manager Terry Collins that he could have played, but the Mets gave him the day off to recuperate. Collins said he was not certain if Cespedes would play Friday against the Nationals. Juan Uribe was sent back to New York to have his chest injury examined more closely. Collins said Uribe’s injury has showed very little improvement, and the Mets will have to decide whether Uribe can be on the division series roster, a decision that does not have to be made until the day of the first game, next Friday. Steven Matz, who missed his scheduled start on Thursday because of a stiff upper back, felt much better. The Mets hope he can pitch in one of the three games against the Washington Nationals to close out the regular season this weekend at Citi Field. If he gets through that in good health, he could pitch against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the division series. Collins said he was not certain when Wilmer Flores (back spasms) would be able to play. Flores said Thursday that he felt better and hoped to play this weekend. Daniel Murphy is also banged up from taking foul balls off his knee and feet, Collins said. Collins added that if the Mets and the Nationals can play their three-game series as scheduled this weekend — forecasts call for heavy rain — the starters will play Friday and Saturday and only part of Sunday’s game. Wright said he wanted to play in all three. He said his back felt strong heading into the playoffs, and he wants to get in proper rhythm as the Mets ramp back up for their first postseason appearance since 2006. “We really need to bear down these last three games and get into the playoffs with some momentum, and kind of spring into the playoffs,” he said. “I think there are some things to clean up, some things we can do better.” The Mets hold the tiebreaker against the Dodgers because of their head-to-head record. Wright said the Mets still coveted home-field advantage, both for tactical reasons — the Dodgers are well below .500 on the road — and as a reward to their fans. Even if the weather is bad, the Mets still expect many more fans to attend the weekend series than showed up in Philadelphia on Thursday. The attendance was announced as 13,238, but there may have been fewer than 3,000 people in seats. Wright indicated the Mets would demonstrate their appreciation to fans at Citi Field this weekend, in their first encounter since clinching the East division. A tip of the cap, he said, would be in order. “It would be nice to give them a good series win against the Nationals before the playoff series begin,” Wright said. “It would be a nice gesture for us to play well in front of them and thank them for their support this year.” Loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:28:55.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
