They have worked so hard from the offseason until now and it’s great to see that hard work pay off. They deserve this.” \nThe North Stars’ next contest will be Tuesday as part of the Class 3A Bartlett Regional, as they take on the winner of a play-in game between Rolling Meadows and Glenbard East. \nWheaton Academy 6, Batavia 3: At Wheaton, Batavia fell to Wheaton Academy in a nonconference match. \nGIRLS VOLLEYBALL \nBatavia def.
