Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 10:47 pm Vikings defeat Eagles to remain unbeaten BY JEFF MEYERS Press-Republican Press-Republican \nBEEKMANTOWN – The Moriah Vikings took another step closer to an undefeated season in Champlain Valley Athletic Conference football Saturday afternoon. \nThe Vikings, ranked eighth in the state, scored two touchdowns 30 seconds apart in the first quarter and never looked back on their way to a 25-20 victory over Beekmantown on the Eagles home turf. \n“We were able to move the ball on the ground,” said Vikings’ coach Don Tesar, noting that Beekmantown did an effective job in limiting Moriah’s outside receiving tandem of seniors Jarrod MacDougal and Taylor Slattery. \nThe Eagles defensive front also helped shut down Moriah’s aerial attack with a lot of pressure on senior quarterback Adam Jaquish. \n“I knew this team would play us tough,” Tesar said of Beekmantown. “They played hard, and they fought to the end.” \nMoriah (6-0) used solid defense as well, limiting the Eagles to seven plays from scrimmage in the first quarter while Colin Harris and Cody Stockwell traded carries to spearhead the Vikings’ early attack. \nHarris scored the first of three rushing touchdowns in the final minutes of the quarter on a nine-yard run off tackle. \n“Colin was coming off a slight concussion from two weeks ago, and we cut back on his touches, but both he and Cody did a good job,” Tesar said of his senior running backs. \nBeekmantown (2-4) fumbled on its first play from scrimmage following Moriah’s score, and the Vikings came right back with Harris scoring on a similar play, this time from 11 yards out. \nBoth defenses controlled action in the second quarter with neither team threatening to score during the 12-minute session. \n“We’ve been working with a younger group on defense since the beginning of the year,” Beekmantown coach Jamie Lozier said. “(Saturday) they really stepped up.” \nBeekmantown’s defense also benefited from a lot of rotation of players, Lozier added. \nThe Eagles came out with a surge in the second half, scoring three minutes into the third quarter on a 22-yard pass from sophomore signal caller Dominick Bordeau to Nathan Handy. Bordeau replaced Alex Archer behind center midway through the second quarter. \nThe score seemed to spark the Vikings as well, however. \nAfter both teams traded three-and-outs following the Eagles’ first score, Moriah benefited from a short punt deep in the Beekmantown zone with a 33-yard drive capped by Harris’ third rushing touchdown with two minutes remaining in the third. \nOn its next possession, Moriah again had good field position, but the Vikings were aided more by a good bounce when a Jaquish pass was tipped by a Beekmantown defender into the arms of Noah Gilbo, who raced 41 yards for the score. \nThat touchdown proved vital as the Eagles put on a spirited comeback, with Bordeau connecting on scoring strikes to Christian Wawrzynski and Handy in the final minute of the contest. \nBeekmantown successfully covered an onside kick following the Wawrzynski score, but a second onside attempt with four seconds remaining failed. \nHarris finished with 99 yards rushing, while Stockwell added 67 for the Vikings. Jaquish passed for 122 yards, with Slattery pulling in three catches for 47 yards. \nBordeau threw for 170 yards with Handy pulling in seven catches for 88 yards. \n— \nMoriah 13 0 12 0 — 25 \nBeekmantown 0 0 6 14 — 20 \nFirst quarter \nMCS- Harris 2 run (Wilson kick), 9:50. \nMCS- Harris 11 run (kick failed), 10:20. \nThird quarter \nBCS- Handy 21 pass from Bordeau (pass failed), 3:32. \nMCS- Harris 2 run (kick failed), 10:01. \nMCS- Gilbo 41 pass from Jaquish (kick failed), 11:55. \nFourth quarter \nBCS- Warwrzynski 20 pass from Bordeau (Handy pass from Bordeau), 11:28. \nBCS- Handy 5 pass from Bordeau (run failed), 11:56. \nIndividual statistics \nRushing \nMCS- Stockwell, 18-67; Harris, 20-99, 3TDs; Tromblee, 1-1; Jaquish, 3-7; MacDougal, 1-45.
