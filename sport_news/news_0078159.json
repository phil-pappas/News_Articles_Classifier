Success scored a stunning goal on 41 minutes with a curling shot from the edge of the box to put Granada 2-1 up, after Piti had drawn them level in the 21st minute. Youssef El Arabi looked to have secured the three points for Granada after he made it 3-1 on 74 minutes, but late goals from Nacho Cases and Guerrero made sure both teams shared the spoils. Success was Granada’s best player on the night, tormenting the Sporting defence before getting booked in the 64th minute. He has now scored two league goals in eight games. In Israel, Nigerian striker Anthony Nwakaeme scored one of the goals as Hapoel Be’er Sheva beat Beitar Jerusalem 3-1 away. Nwakaeme scored in the 21st minute to help Be’er Sheva seal the win. Other goal scorers for Be’er Sheva were Maor Melikson in the 16th minute and Elyaniv Barda in the 52nd minute. Beitar Jerusalem’s only goal came off Nikita Rukavytsya. The goal was Nwakaeme’s third in six league outings for the Israeli outfit. And in the Greek league, former Flying Eagles skipper, Abduljeleel Ajagun, was in action for Panathinaikos who beat PAS Giannina 3-1. Ajagun was to later make way for Georgios Koutrobis with 13 minutes left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:19:38.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
