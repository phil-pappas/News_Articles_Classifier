Ben Robinson did the honors with a 7-yard run. Zeb Maze added the extra point for a 7-0 lead. \nAfter stopping Southeastern on downs, the Bulldogs promptly added to their margin. Robinson scored on his second rushing touchdown of the night, and Addison led 14-0 with 59 seconds remaining in the first quarter. \nThe Bulldogs weren’t done in the opening period, however. Robinson came up big on special teams for Addison, recovering a fumble by the Mustangs on the kickoff. On the next play, quarterback Bryant Ridgeway ran it in himself from six yards out, making the lead 21-0 at the end of the quarter. \nAddison forced a Southeastern punt on the next series and scored again on their very next play. This time they went to the air, with Ridgeway throwing a strike to Kaden Baker, who shook off a tackle as he made the catch and then broke through would-be tackles by two more Mustang defenders on his way to completing a 40-yard pass play to make the score 28-0. \nThe Bulldogs’ final score of the half came after a Braxton Preuitt interception gave them the ball at the Southeastern 41. Ridgeway capped the six-play drive with another 6-yard run, and the halftime score stood at 35-0. \nDuring the impressive first half by Addison, Robinson rushed nine times for 63 yards and two touchdowns. Maze rushed six times for 46 yards. Ridgeway added three rushes for 30 yards and two scores. Ridgeway’s 40-yard TD toss to Baker would be Addison’s only attempted pass of the ballgame. \nAfter a scoreless third quarter, the teams traded big plays in the final stanza. First, the Mustang’s Brandon Jones outran the Bulldog punt team on a 77-yard return for a touchdown with 4:48 remaining to put Southeastern on the scoreboard. \nAddison came back with a 55-yard drive consisting of 5 running plays by Zayne Guthrie. Guthrie’s last carry was for 34 yards and the touchdown. Gage Gilliland added the 2-point conversion, pushing the lead to 43-7. Guthrie finished as the leading rusher for the Bulldogs, totaling 89 yards on nine attempts. Preuitt had nine rushes for 46 yards, along with snaring two interceptions for Addison. \nSoutheastern finished the scoring on a 71-yard quarterback bootleg with only 39 seconds remaining in the game, bringing the final score to 43-14. \nWith the loss, Southeastern fell to 1-8 on the year. Addison moved to 5-4 overall and 3-3 in Class 2A, Region 6. The Bulldogs will face county-rival Winston County next week before heading to No. 6 Red Bay in the first round.
