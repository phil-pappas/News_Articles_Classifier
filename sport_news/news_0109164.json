Smith Jon Niese clapped and pointed heavenwards after striking out Anthony Rizzo in a big spot to end the sixth inning with a Cub on second base. After the rest of the Met bullpen thrived in Game 2 as well, it’s fair to wonder whether Terry Collins and his staff engaged in similar celebration.\nThe non-Jeurys Familia part of the Met relief corps has stuck out as a weak spot this postseason. But Niese, the starter-turned-bullpen-lefty, Addison Reed, Tyler Clippard and, of course, Familia delivered in a 4-1 victory that gave the Mets a 2-0 lead in the NLCS.\nFamilia got his fourth save of the postseason, which means he now holds the Mets’ all-time postseason saves mark, passing Armando Benitez, Tug McGraw and Billy Wagner.\n“Our bullpen, we know what we’re capable of,” said Reed, who threw a scoreless seventh. “We have all the confidence in the world in each other.”\nStill, Terry Collins has called on starters such as Bartolo Colon and even Noah Syndergaard for important playoff innings and who can blame him? Familia has thrown 7.2 scoreless innings this October but if you take his numbers out of the stat sheet, the rest of the relievers’ ERA is a combined 5.40.\nBefore Sunday night, Reed had thrown 1.1 playoff innings and allowed one run and Clippard had allowed one run in 1.2 frames. But Collins went back to the Reed-Clippard setup combo that carried the Mets down the stretch and it worked.\nFirst, though, Niese delivered, getting Rizzo to swing and miss at a full-count, 93 mile-per-hour sinker one batter after Kris Bryant had knocked out Syndergaard with an RBI double.\n“Oh, that was awesome, man,” Clippard said. “I was watching in the bullpen and I felt like he pitched him brilliantly. It obviously got the crowd into it, Niese I’m sure was pumped and it set the tone for the rest of the game.”\n“It was big,” Niese added. “You wanted to stop the bleeding there. It seemed like they had a little bit of momentum there. My job was to stop it.”\nNiese is heading home to Ohio Monday to attend funeral services for his grandmother. He said he’ll drive about a four hours drive on Tuesday to rejoin the Mets in Chicago for Game 3.\nNiese got the ball to Reed, who preserved the lead for Clippard. Clippard’s had trouble commanding his changeup lately, but he threw a scoreless inning.\n“It was nice for me and Reeder to get out there and contribute a little bit and get some reps,” Clippard said.\nAnd get the ball to Familia, who’s only hiccup was thinking a Rizzo grounder toward first in the ninth was going foul. He did not break to cover the base and Rizzo beat Lucas Duda to the bag.\nFamilia got to first on the final out of the game, though, and he and Duda immediately embraced, more celebration on a good night for the Mets’ relief corps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:57:02.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
