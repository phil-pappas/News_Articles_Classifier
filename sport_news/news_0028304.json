Advertisement VOLLEYBALL: Tomball beats Brenham in four sets By Kevin Cook kcook@hcnonline.com Houston Community Newspapers \nTomball’s Lady Cougars improved to 3-3 in District 19-5A Tuesday with a decisive 3-1 home win over the Brenham Cubettes. \nDespite a slow start, the Lady Cougars were able to find their footing in the second set and even their district record, keeping playoff hopes alive. Head Coach Cheri Wallace emphasized the match’s importance to the team’s postseason aspirations. \n“Any time you step onto the court [for a district match], you want to win,” Wallace said. “We need to stay in the top four if we want to make playoffs, so that was a big match tonight. Any time you play a district opponent and win, that’s a great win.” \nThe Brenham Cubettes, led by head coach Debbie Yeager, stormed out to an early 6-0 lead in the first set, which they won convincingly 25-18 in front of a noisy gallery. Brenham traveled so well Tuesday that they frequently seemed to be playing to a home crowd. Coach Wallace acknowledged her team’s slow start and inconsistencies. \n“This team has been a roller coaster all year,” Wallace said. “When they came out and played [Magnolia] West last Friday night, they played gangbusters. I knew they’d have a little letdown because we played really well, but we didn’t win.” \nThe Lady Cougars returned only three varsity starters from last year’s team, so some of the lack of consistency is likely due to a dearth of vocal leadership. \n“This team is hard to figure out, because they’re a very quiet group,” Wallace said. “They’re not very vocal. Trying to figure out what motivates them is one of our toughest battles.” \nWallace won that battle Tuesday, as her young team reeled off three straight sets against Brenham, 25-23, 25-20 and 25-15, picking up steam with each progressively more decisive win. Junior outside hitter Faith Allen – who finished with a team-leading 16 kills – was a key factor in all three won sets. \n“[Allen’s] playing lights out,” Wallace said. “She played lights out against West, too, so she’s had two real good matches. We’ve been working on her just pounding the ball, hitting the ball, and she’s starting to listen a little bit more and she’s having some success and playing really good.” \nSophomore outside hitter Natalia Munoz, generally a major contributor for the Lady Cougars, finished with 10 kills, but was hampered by nagging injuries all night. \n“Of course [Munoz] had injured her hand,” Wallace said, “and I also saw she twisted her ankle out there today, so she’s kind of still limped up and not full force yet. She’s overrunning the ball a little bit right now, because she wants to do so much. It’s just going to take a little time for her to get back in the swing.” \nThe Tomball Lady Cougars hope to push one step closer to a playoff spot when they go on the road Friday to take on Stratford, who just dropped 3 straight sets against Tomball Memorial to fall to 2-4 in district.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:13:12.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
