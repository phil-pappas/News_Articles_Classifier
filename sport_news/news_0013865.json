The collection is a business venture between three core partners: Chief Creative Officer William Cawley , President Tim Garrett and Laird Hamilton, plus various private investors in the fashion and entertainment industries. Launching now for late fall '15, the collection includes board and fitness shorts, hybrid surf and polo shirts, fitness and studio pants, premium and graphic tees and technical hoodie jackets. Price points range from $30.00-$120.00 . Laird Apparel's inspiration comes from the adventurous and unstoppable ever-active lifestyle of Hamilton himself. From the early mornings in the surf, to a day of hardcore training and then into laidback, casual evenings, the collection easily translates to all times of the day. Colors capture the natural pallet of both the \"land and sea,\" with shades of olive, black, white, blue and silver. The collection represents all you need to live life alive through adventure as demonstrated in the WON DAY film. Laird Apparel Design and functionality are the focus of each of the Laird Apparel collections. The Off Shore collection offers hydro efficient styles that include performance shorts, sun protective shirts and heat managing wetsuits, beneficially developed for stand up paddle. The high performance fitness collection features hybrid styles that provide maximum comfort and technical performance while training. Finally, the lifestyle collection captures a classic aesthetic with a selection of casual, loungewear styles including shorts, pants, shirts and jackets. The ever-growing athleisure category played a large role in the launch and creation of Laird Apparel even though Hamilton has been conceptualizing this project for many years. \"I wanted to create a line for the discerning man, which would withstand functional demands with a contemporary and multi-functional edge,\" says Hamilton, \"I wanted to provide my contemporaries with durable, stylish yet masculine clothing that feels unique to the activity he is exploring. It is difficult to find clothing that provides the technical fabrics and tailored construction that is required to achieve this hybrid emphasized by function first .\" Laird Apparel will be available in mid-October on www.lairdapparel.com and at Ron Robinson in Santa Monica, California starting October 22 . Future plans are to expand to other key retailers and resorts worldwide by year-end. For more information please visit the Laird Apparel Instagram , Facebook and Twitter .
