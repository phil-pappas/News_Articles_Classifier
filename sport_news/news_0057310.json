And CAK was up to the challenge.\nCAK’s defense held Clinton’s high-powered offense in check in the first half and its offense dominated the second half as the Warriors secured a 42-21 victory on their senior night to remain unbeaten.\n“We were able to execute except for a little lull in the second quarter,” Bradley said. “They are very athletic and definitely presented us some problems.\n“I thought (the defense) did a good job of bending, not breaking, and giving up some plays, but staying with it and getting stops when we had to get stops. I thought they played really well.”\nPhoto gallery: Scenes from Thursday night's game Clinton’s dynamic quarterback Tyler Thackerson finished with 275 passing yards, but had to work for every yard as the Warriors intercepted him three times.\nThe defense made sure Thackerson didn’t take advantage of the Warriors’ offense slow start, as the unit only managed to score two touchdowns in the first half.\nCAK senior wide receiver Phillip Nichols had nine receptions for 182 yards and two touchdowns.\nNichols gained separation from his defender on a deep post route in the first quarter and hauled in a 47-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Cole Smith for an early 7-0 lead. The deep post route worked again in the second half, as Nichols found enough space to cleanly catch a 33-yard touchdown pass to give CAK (8-0) its first two-possession lead at 21-7.\nThe Warriors cruised in the second half, scoring on their first four possessions. Smith, who completed 21 of 27 for 278 yards for three touchdowns, connected with Austin Pope for a seven-yard touchdown strike and ran for a five-yard touchdown to give the Warriors a 35-14 lead.\nCAK then moved the ball 98 yards on 15 plays to seal the win.\n“This is what we needed before we play Alcoa,” Nichols said about the matchup against the Tornadoes on Oct. 30.\nJonathan Toye is a freelance contributor.\nCAK 42, Clinton 21\nClinton 7 0 7 7—21\nCAK 7 7 21 7—42\nScoring: CAK — Phillip Nichols 47 pass from Cole Smith (Isaac Gallegos kick); Cl — Isaiah Zibbert 2 run (Garret Zody); CAK — Smith 7 run (Gallegos kick); Nichols 33 pas from Smith (Gallegos kick); Austin Pope 7 pass from Smith (Gallegos kick); Cl — Eric Champion 97 kick return (Zody kick); CAK — Smith 5 run (Gallegos kick); Alex Dalton 1 run (Gallegos kick); Cl — J’Quan Thomas 50 pass from Tyler Thackerson (Zody kick)\nRecords: Clinton 3-5, CAK 8-0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:09:42.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
