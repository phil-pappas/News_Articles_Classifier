He did it the right way. He did it without any effort. He's right on schedule.\n\"I was going to work him tomorrow, but we just moved it up a day because of the weather.\"\nSanta Anita-based American Pharoah is preparing for the $5 million Breeders' Cup Classic, which will be run at Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky, on Oct. 31, though Baffert was not yet certain when the horse would be shipped there.\n\"I don't have a ship date right now,\" he said. \"I was going to maybe ship him Monday, but we postponed that. We\"re going to wait.\"\nAsked whether American Pharoah would be sent directly to Keeneland or Churchill Downs, Baffert replied: \"We don't know yet.\"\nAmerican Pharoah entered the pantheon of U.S. thoroughbred racing's all-time greats by winning the Belmont Stakes wire-to-wire in June to become the first horse to capture the coveted 'Triple Crown' in nearly four decades.\nIn winning a seventh straight race, American Pharoah became the 12th horse and first since Affirmed in 1978 to sweep the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.\nAfter making his farewell racing performance in the Breeders' Cup Classic, the muscular son of 2009 Kentucky Derby runner-up Pioneerof the Nile will then retire to stud.
