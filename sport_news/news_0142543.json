Walter Dale Miller has been remembered and praised for his long service to South Dakota. \nThe process of farewell took had an official atmosphere at the state Capitol on Monday, during a memorial service in the rotunda attended by Gov. Dennis Daugaard, U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds and other noted politicians. \nBut final farewells to the West River cowboy – and perhaps the most personal ones -- came closer to home Wednesday, back in western South Dakota not far from where Miller grew up on family ranch in Meade County north of New Underwood. \nFamily, friends and a few noted politicians gathered at the Calvary Lutheran Church in Rapid City for Miller's funeral service. It was a celebration of a long life that made a difference, to Miller’s family and his state. \nIn scripture and song -- and just a bit of cowboy poetry -- those who loved Miller said goodbye in a spirit of sadness and celebration. \nMiller’s grandson, Bart Miller, said a life of almost 90 years filled with rich family connections, hard work, spiritual faith and political will was a lot to mourn, but also a lot to celebrate. \n\"He lived a great life, made a lot of changes, helped a lot of people, mentored -- but also brought a lot of people to Jesus,\" Bart Miller said. \"That's what I think of my grandpa.\" \nFamily members sang, spoke and wept without reservation, as they bid farewell to a patriarch who taught fundamental lessons in life. \n\"My grandfather taught me how to work,\" Bart Miller said. \"He worked from sundown to sunset. And growing up on a ranch, that's what you did.\" \nThat work ethic took Miller to the state Capitol, where he had a 20-year legislative career and became the only person in history to hold every leadership position – from majority leader for the Republicans to Speaker of the House and President of the Senate. \nAs the state's first full-time lieutenant governor, he was prepared for a tragic step up when Gov. George S. Mickelson died in an airplane crash in April of 1993. Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who attended both the Capitol memorial service and the funeral service in Rapid City, said Miller was the perfect man at the perfect time. \nPeople across South Dakota were in stunned grief at the tragedy as Daugaar took charge, Daugaard said. \n“We certainly were all in shock at the crash of that state airplane, when we lost Gov. Mickelson and seven other South Dakota leaders that day,” Daugaard said. “And we needed someone steady and experienced, as Gov. Walter Dale Miller was. And he stepped in and reassured us with his steadiness and his calm demeanor.\" \nMiller would serve less than two yearsas governor, facing challenges ranging from a prison riot to flooding to the sudden need for a special legislative session and painful budget cuts. He lost a Republican primary race in 1994 to former Gov. Bill Janklow, but continued to work for solutions throughout the remained over his term. \n“So he was a man that confronted unexpected challenges and rose to meet them,” Daugaard said. \nIn remarks during the funeral service, Daugaard also said the state will be different without Miller. \n“It’s hard to imagine South Dakota without Walter Dale Miller,” he said. \nMiller was a strong, West River conservative, but he was willing to cooperate and form friendships with politicians on the other side of the aisle – particularly when it mean passing important legislation. \nFormer state Rep. Linda Lea Viken, a Rapid City lawyer known for her passionate Democratic politics, served with Miller in the state Legislature in the 1970s and worked well with him. \n\"Walter Dale was a strong Republican. And I'm a pretty good Democrat,\" Viken said. \"I knew Walter Dale maybe in ways that some other people didn’t. I knew that under that crusty exterior was a really good, kind-hearted man.\" \nOver time, they became friends. \n“He used to tease me and I used to tease him. One time he suggested I should become a Republican so I could be attorney general. I kindly declined that,\" Viken said. \"But through the years we were able to work together on issues in the Legislature. We even sponsored some tax bills together. And he invited me to speak at his 80th birthday. And so we’ve always remained good friends.” \nViken said Miller wasn’t just a politician. \n\"I look at him more as a statesman than a politician,\" she said. \"And the thing is, he was always concerned about the issue, not whose idea it was. But what the issue was. And, frankly we're missing that now.\" \nThat's not all that's lost, with Miller's passing. \n\"We'll miss him,\" Viken said. \"I'll miss him, personally.\" \nMiller was buried Wednesday near the Viewfield cemetery not far from his home ranch. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
