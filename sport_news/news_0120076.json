And don’t forget school work. \nBut it’s what Robinson does in between all those normal high school chores that sets him apart from most North Jersey athletes. \nRobinson helps care for his five younger siblings each day while his mother, Nicole McDonald, works as a nurse. On Fridays, he spends the whole day at a physical therapy center as part of an internship. \nThat’s just for openers. On Saturdays — even after games — and Sundays, Robinson works at a local restaurant as a cashier and occasional cook. \n“I’m a dedicated person,” Robinson said. “I have been since I was a young boy. If I have a goal, I will do anything to accomplish that goal. Nothing will stop me.” \nThe 5-foot-7, 180-pound Robinson has burst on the scene this fall after injuries took a healthy chunk out of his first two varsity seasons. He tore his ACL three games into his sophomore year and broke his shoulder before his junior season when he accidentally was pushed into a goalpost during a 7-on-7 competition. \n“He’s been plagued with injuries the last two years, but they were freak things,” said Palisades Park/Leonia first-year coach Mike Coyne. “Everyone has been saying, ‘Be careful with JoJo.’ Everyone except JoJo.” \nThis is Robinson’s first season as a quarterback. But in five games for the Tigers (2-3), he has rushed for 491 yards and seven touchdowns, and thrown for 344 yards and two TDs. Throw in punt and kickoff returns, and he has piled up 935 all-purpose yards. \n“This has been a long time coming, but now it’s paying off,” said Robinson, who lives in Edgewater and attends Leonia High School. “I had great support from my family, friends and coaches, and I knew I could come back stronger and be a better player.” \nCoyne originally wanted to keep Robinson off the defensive unit this season, but he couldn’t afford to keep his talent on the bench. Robinson has two interceptions and returned one for a touchdown. \n“Not many balls are caught against him,” said Coyne, whose team faces Pompton Lakes on Saturday. \nCoyne said Robinson won’t allow himself to be pampered just because he’s the quarterback. \n“You know the old stereotype about a quarterback being soft?” Coyne asked. “Not him. There’s no red shirt in practice for him. \n“He does the tackle drills. He hits the sleds with us. He even ran a kid over in walkthrough.” \nRobinson, who also stars in track, wants to play college football. But his lack of exposure the previous two seasons has slowed the recruiting process. He’s putting together his highlight film and understands that he may have to wait until the end of the season before finding the right suitor. \n“Hopefully, a couple of coaches will contact me before the end of the season,” Robinson said. “They just don’t know about me yet. My mom has always told me I had the will to do anything I think I can.” \nRobinson has thought about studying business or criminal justice, but he’s also interested in physical therapy. That’s why he’s part of the year-long internship program. \n“I come in the room with the doctor, and he shows me what he does with the patient,” Robinson said. “I’m always asking questions. If you don’t know the field, you have to ask questions to know what’s going on. Asking questions will only benefit me later on.” \nCoyne said Robinson basically is “a self-motivated kid,” but he also draws inspiration from his family. Robinson said he’s teaching his three younger brothers to be gentlemen, and he is motivated by all his mother does for the family. \n“My mother is always telling me she’s proud of me, but she’s the best woman in the world,” Robinson said. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:34:39.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
