Similarly, athletes under Category 'B' (sprinters and team events) will get Rs 400 per day, while sportspersons qualifying under Category 'C' (golf, shooting and archery) will be entitled for Rs 300 per day.\nThe ministry has also decided to increase the daily allowances of junior athletes as the age-category national campers will receive 75 per cent of the amount that has been fixed for their seniors.\ndna has reliably learnt that the ministry has also released a revised list of 14 branded and generic food supplements, which will be procured by the Sports Authority of India (SAI). The doctors and coaches, attached with the teams, will have to keep this list in mind while recommending any food supplement to the athletes.\nBut, for those athletes who prefer branded food supplements, which are sometimes not available with the SAI, they have to approach their respective national federation to make them available.\nAnd, this is where the ministry has been caught on the wrong foot. By allowing the sports federations to directly purchase the food supplement from companies on the request of athletes, the ministry has gone back on its earlier decision when it used to select brands and food supplement suppliers.\nIt was the job of the SAI to procure food supplements from the companies empanelled to the ministry. But, by empowering the federations to directly purchase the food supplements from suppliers, the ministry runs into the risk of increased dope-related cases in the near future.\n\"The independent procurement of food supplements from different companies could be a tricky matter. The ministry, I believe, has made it mandatory that all food supplements should only be procured after getting a certificate from the said company about its safety and WADA compliance. But, still there can't be a 100 per cent guarantee that the food supplement won't have a banned substance. The federation might err on this aspect. WADA will never accept any plea in case a banned substance is found in any test,\" leading sports medicine expert Dr Ashok Ahuja said.\nFor the record, WADA had conducted a random test in 45 countries to ascertain the quality of food supplements procured by the federations and athletes from outside. It was found out that around 70 per cent of food supplements were in the banned list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:50:40.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
