(Photo by Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images) KANSAS CITY, Mo. - \nKansas City Royals left fielder Alex Gordon suffered a bloody nose during off-day batting practice when he was struck by a ball off his own bat on Thursday. \nGordon hit a ball that struck the top of the batting cage and it ricocheted directly back at him and hit him in the nose. He was momentarily stunned and bleeding before leaving the field for treatment. \nThe situation won't prevent Gordon from being in the lineup for Friday's Game 6 of the American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. Kansas City has a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series. \nCopyright 2015, Schurz Communications", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:35:54.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
