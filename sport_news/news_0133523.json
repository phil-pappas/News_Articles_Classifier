The Browns have now explained the Joe Haden injury situation. \nYesterday I said I've never questioned Haden and his toughness, but I'm hoping this broken finger really was the reason he missed Sunday's game against the Chargers. The Browns listed Haden as probable, meaning he was likely to play, but then on game day, Haden decided he couldn't play. \nYou could tell Haden was protecting the finger yesterday at practice. He did the drills one-handed and with his left hand. The NFL said it was looking into this which is common practice when a player is listed as probable and then all of a sudden can't play. The Browns listed Haden with a finger injury but did not say it was broken. Yesterday player and coach gave their explanation, which included the term \"lack of communication.\" \nLack of communication is one of those phrases used by struggling teams. I'm giving Haden and the Browns the benefit of the doubt here, and hopefully this isn't a case where players start giving up on this team. \nWe've heard rumblings that some players were unhappy because Manziel was not starting, and this defense is under fire, ranked last when the expectations were Top 10. \nThe Browns have one of the toughest schedules, but maybe their toughest opponents will be miscommunication and frustration. You have to clean that up first. \nTweet me your thoughts @johnWKYC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:44:01.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
