Fiji went on to beat Vanuatu on penalties in the final to become the first Pacific Islands side to qualify for the Olympic soccer tournament. \nREVIEW \nNZF had conducted a review of all their teams since the initial decision and identified 16 players who could be in danger of breaching eligibility rules. \nThey had presented an initial 10 cases for approval for exemption from FIFA, eight of which had been granted, Martin said. \nWhile Wynne was one of the two not yet to have been granted an exemption, Martin said his case was consistent with the eight approvals, but FIFA were seeking more information. \nMartin said the appeal decision was still being scrutinised by NZF's lawyers, who would weigh up whether to take an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland. \nThey have 21 days to appeal Friday's decision. \nOne of the concerns, he added, was that even if NZF won the eligibility appeal it was unclear as to whether the Oceania final could be replayed. \nRelations with the other 10-member nations of the sparsely populated confederation would also need to be considered. \nNZF went against their OFC colleagues in late May when they voted for FIFA presidential challenger Prince Ali bin Al Hussein instead of incumbent Sepp Blatter following the arrest of 14 leading soccer officials in a corruption scandal days before the governing body's election. \nThe OFC had previously unanimously agreed to back Blatter for a fifth term. The 79-year-old Swiss resigned just days after he was re-elected and has since been suspended for 90 days by the world governing body's Ethics Committee as it investigates a 2011 payment from FIFA to UEFA President Michel Platini. \n(Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Ian Ransom/Peter Rutherford) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
