The event gives the Hawkeyes a chance to reclaim the NCAA dual attendance record. Penn State set the current mark, drawing 15,996 fans to the Bryce Jordan Center for a meet against Pitt on Dec. 8, 2013. \nThe UI Athletics Ticket Office had sold approximately 13,900 tickets before they were available to the general public, adding more than 7,000 to that total Thursday. More tickets are expected to be sold online overnight as well. \nThe dual will begin at 11 a.m. before the Hawkeyes host Minnesota in football at 7 p.m. \nServing as a guest speaker at the monthly Presidential Committee on Athletics meeting Thursday, Iowa Coach Tom Brands said he has competed in an outdoor event in cold weather overseas. The dual isn’t a first, but it is rare at the NCAA Division I level and attractive with the long history and traditions of Iowa and Oklahoma State. \n“This is not an original idea,” said Brands, noting he’s wrestled in the 45-degree weather of southern Russia. “What is original is it is at the Division I level, and that it is a big dual meet with a lot of significance.” \nIowa students receive free admission to the event, but must have a ticket to enter. All student seating is general admission, which includes a limited number of seats on the field. \nTickets remain available and are $10 apiece. They can be purchased at the UI Athletic Tickets Office via phone at 1-800-IA-HAWKS or online at www.hawkeyesports.com . \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:41:56.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
