And now, Richards is hoping for a taste of more. \n\"It's a blessing,\" he said. \"It's something I was praying for. I got the call and I hope to make the most of it.\" \nWhile Richards, who grew up in Del City, OK, was a huge Dallas Cowboys fan as a kid - he'd sit on the couch and watch all the games with his dad, Jeff Sr. - he didn't play much. It wasn't because he didn't love the game. \n\"I loved sports, I was a big-time football fan,\" said Richards. \"I would always go out for the team - I wanted to play on the JV team, I wanted to play on the varsity team - but I'd end up not making it. I was just too small, they didn't take me seriously. \n\"I was 5-foot-6, then I grew six inches (heading into my senior year). I was 17 and decided to give it a try. I haven't stopped since. They put me in the middle of the field, I was a safety, they told me to just go get the ball. I ended up leading the state in interceptions, somehow.\" \nIt was from Big Jeff that Little Jeff got his sports enthusiasm, while his personality was largely shaped by his mother Willette. \n\"My dad's a big sports fan,\" said Richards. \"He's pretty hip to the CFL. He's also a big hockey fan. He actually likes the Vancouver Canucks. He started running (the family) business, a diner, (Geronimo Bakery) at 18; it was passed along from my grandfather and it's been in Oklahoma City going on 49 years. My mom's where I get my feistiness from. She's a rah-rah type of person. Dad's real laid back. They balance each other out.\" \nNow 6-foot-2, Richards is happy to be in Ottawa, a place where he says he quickly felt at home. \n\"It was never one of those things where I was the outcast,\" said Richards. \"Guys welcome you with open arms. I love this team, I've never won a Grey Cup, obviously. But you know the feeling you get with something special ... there's a camaraderie around here, the way guys lay it on the line for each other. Something big's in store for this team, I truly believe that.\" \nAnd while he's now one of the taller kids, he's still the same old Jeff Richards in his old neighbourhood. \n\"I still go home and they call me Little Jeff,\" he said. \"I'm the little guy to everybody. More than anything, people can't believe I'm still playing. Once I started playing, I knew God had a plan for me. I feel like I'm the most versatile player on the field on any team. I'll play anywhere, I'll do anything to contribute.\" \nRichards had tryouts in Cleveland, Indianapolis, Green Bay, New York (Jets) and Calgary before landing in Ottawa. He just kept pushing on. \n\"You either get stronger or you quit,\" said Richards. \"I'm to the point now where I'm numb to it, numb to hearing no. I'm hungry for that yes. I'm trying every day to get more yeses.\" \nMAKING SOME NOISE \nDuring parts of practice the past couple of days, the RedBlacks have pumped out loud music over the TD Place sound system, trying to get the offence used to running plays under noisy situations, something they'll have to deal with Saturday in Winnipeg. \"You can do crowd noise, but it helps that the offence doesn't get distracted and they can communicate with themselves with loud noise,\" said RedBlacks coach Rick Campbell. \"It's not for the dancing part of it, but it's good for people to perform a task and not get distracted by outside stuff.\" \nTHE END AROUND \nWill kick returner/receiver Jamill Smith, who was signed on Tuesday, play on Saturday? \"He's definitely a possibility,\" said Campbell. \"We're taking a look at him in practice and making sure he's up to speed. He's definitely going to be a discussion (Thursday) as to whether he'll be on or not. The thing about Jamill, he's very consistent, he comes to work every day and he's a good teammate. He's a guy with a big heart; the game's very important to him and he makes the most of his time out here. That can be infectious to other people.\" ...
