The threat to RTI too is somewhat alike. Though Maharashtra gets most applications, it has also seen highest number of activists killed â€” 10.\nLack of implementation, compliance of orders of the commission and interpretation are also restricting the Act's ambit, say activists.\n\"The journey of the Act has been zigzag with highs and lows. Success of RTI has been based on public information officer's willingness to give information and those officers who want to have it implemented. When they are not around, the Act falls flat,\" said activist Vijay Kumbhar.\nThis is where suo motu disclosures come in place. \"If they implement suo motu disclosures, then neither activists will lose their lives nor will people have to apply,\" said Bhaskar Prabhu.\n\"That, however, will not happen because that is expecting something from a system which it does not want to give. Even if they do, it cannot give some information, it cannot go unchallenged like in the case of toll data they have put because it seems to be false,\" said Sandip Shetty, brother of Satish Shetty, RTI activist who was killed for exposing corruption by his usage of RTI Act.\nHe added: \"The other issue is from the courts that have not helped as much.\"\nThe angst of citizens with court orders has risen lately because of some orders that have been cited by authorities to prohibit information. Shailesh Gandhi had to withdraw his plea seeking to challenge the high court order that dismissed his petition challenging denial of information in case of Ajit Pawar's tax returns.\n\"The judgment they cite is of Girish Desphande, which has not take into account some crucial points in the Act that information that cannot be denied to Parliament can be denied to a person,\" said Gandhi.\n\"Girish Deshpande order did not become the talking point like Namit Sharma probably because it did not shut down the commissions. However, there needs to be a greater debate on it,\" said Vijay Kumbhar.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/114104016390003618788/posts"], "published": "2015-10-12T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:23:09.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
