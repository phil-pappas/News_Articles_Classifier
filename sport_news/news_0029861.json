GRAVES The Associated Press \nLouisville campus police say they are reviewing allegations that a former men's basketball staffer hired escorts to dance and have sex with recruits and players in a dormitory. \nKatina Powell has alleged in a book released online over the weekend that former Cardinals director of basketball operation Andre McGee paid her $10,000 for dancers to perform 22 shows from 2010-14 at the players' Billy Minardi Hall dormitory. The school reported those allegations to the NCAA and has launched an investigation. \nUniversity police chief Wayne Hall said Tuesday in a brief statement his department is also working with Louisville Metro Police and the Commonwealth Attorney's Office to review Powell's allegations against the program. \nCardinals coach Rick Pitino has said that McGee denied Powell's allegations. \nMcGee is currently an assistant at Missouri-Kansas City, which has put him on paid leave.
