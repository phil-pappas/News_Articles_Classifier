Well, there is one cause that’s worth hugging for. \nHowever, before the hug comes a heated sports debate. Why does Jay hate the Saints? Will LSU’s Leonard Fournette run wild against Florida? What does the Cajun football team’s key to success have in common with one of Jay’s eating habits? It’s all part of this week’s episode of FAST FIVE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:09:46.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
