Penguins' Fleury shuts out tired Senators 0 Gene J. Puskar \nPenguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury (29) blocks a shot by Ottawa Senators' Kyle Turris (7) during the first period of an NHL hockey game in Pittsburgh Thursday. \nRECAP \nThe Penguins got goals from Evgeni Malkin and Daniel Sprong, and Marc-Andre Fleury made 22 saves to shut out the Ottawa Senators 2-0 on Thursday night. \nIt was the first time the Senators had been shutout in 128 games, and that was probably due in part to the fatigue of playing on back-to-back nights. \nThe Penguins took full advantage and looked like the fresher team throughout. The home team won most of the puck battles and outshot the visitors 36-22. \nMalkin scored just 23 seconds into the second period, and Sprong added to that lead 2:02 later and Fleury did the rest. \nSidney Crosby and Phil Kessel were held off the board, but it wasn’t for a lack of trying. The duo combined for seven shots on goal, and each buzzed around Senators’ goalie Craig Anderson often. \n“In the end I'd say they had five or six really good chances,” coach Mike Johnston said of his top line. “Sid in particular probably had three outstanding chances.” \nIt might not have been perfect, after all the power play was again shut out and has now gone 0-12 on the season, but that didn’t damper Fleury’s mood. \n“It’s a good feeling. Those first games, it just seems like we’re searching for ourselves a little bit out there. I don’t think we had a full consistent game and tonight it felt really good from the start until the end.” \nNOTABLE \nThe Penguins are 7-1-1 against the Senators at Consol Energy Center and have pushed their all-time record on home ice against them to 26-13-7. \nThe Penguins have posted a sparkling 6-1 record against Senators goalie Craig Anderson in their last seven outings against him. \nThe game featured two of the top defensemen in the league in the Penguins’ Kris Letang and Senators Erik Karlsson. Letang finished the game with one assist, one shot on goal, two hits, two blocked shots and a plus-one rating over a game-high 28:06 of ice time. Karlsson took two minor penalties, one shot on goal and finished with a minus-two rating. \nForwards Matt Cullen and Kevin Porter picked up their first points for the club, as each earned assists on Sprong’s goal. \nDavid Perron finished with a game-high seven shots on goal skating with Malkin and Patric Hornqvist. \nBeau Bennett missed the game with an undisclosed injury. He led the club with three goals in four preseason games and was one of the team’s better forwards over their three-game losing streak to open the season. Bennett’s next game will be his 100th in the NHL. \nQuotable \n\"I just shot, caught a pass from Cully, Cully gave it to me, and I just shot it. I saw Anderson sliding, and I just wanted to put it high and a pretty special moment. I had three friends in town, a pretty special moment.\" \n-- Daniel Sprong on scoring his first NHL goal. \nHIDDEN STAT \n7 – Number of hits that Sidney Crosby has collected through four games this season. He collected five hits against the Canadiens on Tuesday night, which was the second highest single game total of his career. His career high was a six hit game against the Flyers back on Nov. 13, 2008. \nPLAY OF THE GAME \nLeading 1-0 on an Evgeni Malkin goal, the Penguins were looking for insurance and got it at 2:25 of the second period. Rookie Daniel Sprong, who logged 13:07 of ice time and four shots on goal, hit the ice with Kevin Porter and Matt Cullen. Cullen got the puck along the left wing boards and found Sprong in the high slot where he lashed a wrist shot that beat Sens goalie Craig Anderson. The Penguins would go on to win the game 2-0. \nTHREE STARS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:35:14.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
