PlayYourCourse will utilize the same technology, as sister company PlayYourCourt, to offer a more convenient solution for golfers in search of instruction. Through PlayYourCourse.com prospective players can browse and in a few clicks book golf lessons with top-rated instructors at their local course or driving range.\nGolf has been on the steady decline in recent years and a major factor has been accessibility. Golf has long been viewed as an elitist sport limited to those who can afford high-priced country club dues. PlayYourCourse aims to break down these barriers and make the sport of golf more accessible to the average citizen.\nThere is no doubt with the recent surge and success of platforms like Open Table, Seamless, and Uber that consumers are more driven by convenience-based business models than ever before. When asked about the role convenience plays in the lesson buying process, PlayYourCourse CEO, Scott Baxter answered - “The way people participate in sports and activities is changing and golf is no different. We are looking at a new consumer that is more geared towards convenience-based decision-making than ever before. If they can’t pick up their phone and schedule it, they simply aren’t going to do it.”\nAnother big problem the golf industry faces is that many professionals aren’t teaching enough lessons to make a living and are being forced out of the golf industry into more stable career paths. Jeremy Franks, PGA certified instructor and Head Golf Professional at James River County Club in Newport News, VA commented on the value of the model, “PlayYourCourse is a great way for instructors to promote themselves and reach new students they would not otherwise be able to attain.”\nIf Baxter can scale his success from tennis over to golf, there will be a lot of happy instructors and golfers out there. The tennis model, PlayYourCourt, currently employs over 475 tennis instructors nationwide and has brought more than 10,000 new people into the sport of tennis over the last year. When asked about his goals for PlayYourCourse Baxter said, “My focus is simply to get more people playing golf. I understand how challenging it is for instructors to fill their lesson books and for consumers to find quality instruction. I’m hoping to kill two birds with one stone and make the sport more accessible to both golfers and instructors.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:59:13.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
