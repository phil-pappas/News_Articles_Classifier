(AP) - Opposition is expected again to a request to expand the Faircloth rubbish landfill near Clinton.\nHinds County is conducting a public hearing Tuesday on a request to modify the county's local solid waste management plan to allow for expansion of the solid waste landfill by 26.5 acres, essentially doubling its size.\nThe Clarion-Ledger reports ( http://on.thec-l.com/1QmoUCq ) residents and the owners of the landfill have been at odds for many years over the Class 1 rubbish landfill just south of the Clinton city limits.\nIn 2012, the Board of Supervisors voted against a conditional use permit to expand the landfill but later approved the request 3-2 after then-Supervisor Kenneth Stokes voted for it. Residents appealed the board's decision and won on a technicality. That led to the process having to start over.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
