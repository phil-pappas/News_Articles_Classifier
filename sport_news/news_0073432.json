Logan Bowles / USA TODAY Sports FOX Sports South Zach Dillard Share This Story Updated Oct 15, 2015 at 12:47a ET \nATLANTA — Tiago Splitter's past and present collided in a first-quarter defensive possession on Wednesday night. The former Spurs center entered the game and immediately found himself posted up against Tim Duncan , his former teammate and close friend, a position he'd filled on countless occasions in practice but never before in an official NBA game. \nThree possessions later, Splitter once again found himself on the defensive as Duncan and Manu Ginobili attacked off the pick-and-roll for an easy runner in the lane. How many times had Splitter seen that combo, defended that exact play at the Spurs' practice facility in northwest San Antonio? \n“Well, a lot,\" Splitter said with a smile after Atlanta's 100-86 preseason win. \"Manu’s great at doing that. He’s one of the best in the pick-and-roll and it’s hard to defend them.\" \nAfter five successful seasons with the Spurs, including three conference finals appearances and one NBA title, Splitter is settling into his new role as the Atlanta Hawks ' top reserve big man. The adjustment period was abbreviated due to the Mike Budenholzer's presence — Splitter's former assistant coach who carried familiar schemes and concepts East with him — but seeing his former teammates and coaches made for quite a different experience. \nSplitter finished with three points and six rebounds in 18 minutes on Wednesday, occasionally flashing the hustle plays that earned him his high-quality reputation and made it so difficult for Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and general manager R.C. Buford to part with him in an early-offseason trade. \n\"You won’t find him on an ESPN clip, for sure,\" Popovich said of Splitter, \"but you’ll find him on the winning side of the ledger.\" \nThe Spurs have made such decisions before in order to stay ahead of the Western Conference curve. The 2011 NBA Draft, which eventually brought future NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard to San Antonio, was a particularly difficult one for Popovich and the Spurs front office. In order to land the No. 15 overall pick, the future Hall of Fame coach and Buford were forced to send point guard George Hill , Pop's self-appointed favorite player, to the Pacers . \nThe Splitter trade struck a similar cord — an under-the-radar player that had grown into an integral piece of the Spurs' success — and the move to create cap space did not come without hesitation. \n\"It was very difficult,\" Popovich said at Wednesday's shootaround. \"When someone is with you for a while you get close to the family. That's the business side of the situation that shows its ugly head once in a while. If we wanted to add the talent that we added, you had to do something. You can't pay everybody.\" \nSan Antonio needed cap space, and moving Splitter's $8.5 million contract was the practical choice. It created the necessary room to land four-time All-Star big man LaMarcus Aldridge in the league's largest offseason free-agent splash. \nIn hindsight, the Hawks-Spurs transaction seems obvious. Budenholzer entered free agency wielding cap space with a specific need for frontcourt depth and size. On multiple occasions Budenholzer, who also serves as Atlanta's president of basketball operations, expressed his intent to shore up the team's defensive rebounding — and a familiar name was available. The deal went down on July 1, the first day of free agency. \nPopovich described it a \"perfect fit for both parties.\" \nSplitter's contract runs through the 2016-17 season at $16.75 million, a presumed bargain for the Hawks, who now feature one of the league's deepest and most versatile front lines. \n\"(The Spurs) always told me to do the little things, things that do not show up in the stats or is not beautiful in the highlights. You try to do everything you can to win games,\" said Splitter, who scored three points and grabbed six rebounds against his former team. \"Sometimes it’s doing that. Sometimes it’s scoring 40 points. Sometimes it’s rebounding 20 rebounds. Those little things count, too.\" \nVersatility is a common theme found in Splitter evaluations, often times disguised in such clichés like \"little things\" and \"dirty work.\" He sets quality picks, understands spacing, makes smart passes, defends multiple positions well and, in Budenholzer's words, is able to put constant pressure on the rim. \nLimited by a calf injury last season, the 6-foot-11 big man averaged 8.2 points and 4.8 rebounds in 52 games last season — his least productive campaign since his rookie season. \nBox scores tell partial tales, though. Splitter is a difference-maker when healthy, particularly on the defensive end. \nLooking back at San Antonio's back-to-back NBA Finals runs in 2013 and 2014, Splitter was a primary factor in two consecutive top-three NBA defenses. Opponents shooting percentages and offensive efficiency plummeted when he was on the floor: SEASON", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:59:00.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
