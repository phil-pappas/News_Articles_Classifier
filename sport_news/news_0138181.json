Robinson won the tournament and West was the runner-up. Posted: Tuesday, October 6, 2015 6:33 pm | Updated: 11:59 pm, Tue Oct 6, 2015. \nBilly West grew up knowing Gary Robinson as \"the Jack Nicklaus of Cumberland County.\" \nMore than 30 years later, the moniker still applies. \nIf the Cumberland County Golf Championship is the measuring stick, then Robinson is the Golden Bear. He recently won his eighth county title, more than anyone else in the 47-year history of the event. The player closest to him is West, who owns six titles. The two players have separated themselves as the best amateur golfers in Cumberland County, dating back to 1982 when Robinson won his first title. The next highest in wins is Mike Williford and Gary Moore with three each. \nTheir rivalry is a fierce one on the golf course but they are friends off the course. \n\"We both want to beat the guy who has the most titles,\" Robinson said. \"It seems like Billy and I are there most of the time with a mix of other good players. It's a good rivalry and we have developed quite a friendship from it.\" \nRobinson had won four titles before West played in his first county championship at the age of 16 in 1990. \n\"It's been a fun and friendly rivalry for sure,\" West said. \"I've always had a reverence for the city-county, that's what I call it. I knew Gary had won it four times when I played in my first one. I thought that beating the fellow who had won the most would be a nice goal to attain.\" \nRobinson turned pro in the 1990s, playing the mini-tours, which made him ineligible to compete in the county amateur championship. He eventually regained his amateur status, returned to the tournament and won it back to back in 2001 and '02. \n\"When Gary won those two, now he's ahead of me 6-2 (in titles),\" West said. \"I'm thinking I'm way behind.\" \nBut West put together two back-to-back wins in 2004 and '05 and 2010 and '11 to square the titles at six apiece. Then Robinson bounced back to win the county title in 2013 and this year to regain the lead. He might have won three in a row but he missed the 2014 tournament because it conflicted with the U.S. Senior Amateur, which Robinson qualified for. \n\"You know, Gary won the N.C. Mid Amateur and two of the last three county tournaments,\" West said. \"At his age, that is extraordinary.\" \nAge is one of the differences between the two - Robinson is 56 and West is 41. \n\"My time is getting shorter to win than his is,\" Robinson said. \"It was good for me to win this year to get out front. I want to get as many as I can get.\" \nWest is not surprised that Robinson is still playing golf at such a high level. Two weeks after the county tournament in September, Robinson finished among the top eight in the country in the U.S. Senior Amateur. Before the county tournament, he had competed in major senior events in Canada, New York and South Carolina. He even squeezed in qualifying, along with partner Brian Dreier, for the U.S. Four-Ball Championship next year in New York. \n\"Being in all these tournaments recently, helped me win this year,\" Robinson said. \"I had to make a lot of nervous 3-footers and some of these guys had none.\" \nWest agreed with that. \n\"All those tournaments have kept his game really sharp,\" West said. \"Gary has kept himself in good shape. He is a strong, athletic person. He was a really good baseball player before he took up golf. \n\"The thing that has allowed him to compete in his 50s is his length. He is hitting the ball 280 to 300 yards off the tee. He hits it as far as the young guys. That allows him to compete with people of all ages.\" \nWest's strength lies in his uncanny accuracy. That's why half of his county titles have come at King's Grant Golf & Country Club that is tighter than some of the other tournament venues. \n\"I am average in length,\" West said. \"I do it on accuracy and consistency. Gary hits it 30 or 40 yards past me. When you can reach par 5s in two or he's hitting an 8-iron in and I'm hitting a 5-iron, that adds up in his favor. Gary's strength is, he doesn't have any weaknesses.\" \nDon't think that either man just plays golf and does nothing else. Robinson builds homes for a living, while West is the Cumberland County district attorney. \n\"I'm working when I'm traveling,\" Robinson said. \"It takes a toll on you. You've got to be in super shape.\" \nWest can't find the time to travel to play in tournaments any more between his job and having young children. \n\"I can't take time from work and my family now like I used to,\" he said. \"It cuts into my time to compete on a regional or statewide level. Golf is my hobby now, my diversion.\" \nRobinson knows he has a target on his back every time he tees it up in the county championship. \n\"There's so much expectation,\" he said. \"Everybody thinks you're going to win. That's what was so great about Tiger Woods. He was expected to win and he did. There are very few that can come through. It's such a difficult thing.\" \nRobinson believes their rivalry has spurred each other on. \n\"No matter what level you play at, competition makes you better,\" he said. \"We push each other.\" \nBoth men hold the county championship in high regard. Robinson has called it his favorite tournament and West tries to have his game peak for it. \n\"Gary and I have joked that we get more mentions around town for winning the city-county than if we won the U.S. Amateur,\" West said. \"Locally, there's a large group that follows the city-county.\" \nBut there is not such a large group that plays in it any more. The event used to draw more than 200 players and required two golf courses to handle it. This year, the number was less than 60 players. West cited a general decline in participation in amateur golf tournaments and people having busier lives as reasons for having less players. \n\"There are still a lot of low handicappers who want to win,\" he said. \"The former champions take so much pride in it. But we've lost the 5 to 15 handicapper, the weekend golfer. The city-county used to be a rite of passage. If you were an avid golfer, you played in it. That's the way it was. Hopefully, we can publicize it more at all the local golf courses and make it a little bit stronger.\" \nThat hasn't detracted from Robinson and West's rivalry. \n\"It's been fun to watch what Gary has been able to do the last couple of years,\" West said. \"I would like to think my game will have the longevity of his.\" \nMeanwhile, Robinson finds a difference between him and Nicklaus. Unlike the Golden Bear, Robinson knows right where he stands. \n\"I've read that Nicklaus didn't think about how many majors he had won, he wasn't counting them,\" Robinson said. \"I find that hard to believe.\" \nStaff writer Eddie Southards can be reached at southardse@fayobserver.com or 486-3518.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:13:28.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
