Bender finished tied for 23rd in Class AA. \nLogan Sears, a senior from Selinsgrove, missed his chance to advance to the championship tournament. Sears posted an 83, failing to earn one of Class AAA’s 24 spots in the final event. Sears finished tied for 39th place. \nSelina Albert, a sophomore from Lourdes Regional, finished 12th out of 14 girls competing in the Class AA level. Albert finished with 103 strokes, 13 strokes off the qualifying score. \nGeiger — who overcame a triple-bogey on the par-3 15th hole — relied on executing consistent shots, according to Kanaskie. \n“I don’t think I struck the ball all that well,” said Geiger, who lost a playoff for the final berth to the state championships two year ago as a freshman. “But the way I played, I guess I made the most of it. I wanted to get back here and make it through.” \nGeiger, who opened on the 10th hole as part of a shotgun start, notched two early birdies before posting a six on the par-3, 179-yard 15th. \n“I had to put it behind me,” he said. \nThe course’s fast greens provided a challenge, according to Geiger, who considers his short game his strength. \n“I got a couple of funny bounces around the green,” he said. “Overall, I think I chipped and putted pretty well. I really had to grind.” \nBender — who started at No. 12 and finished the back nine with a 10-over 46 — expressed disappointment in his overall performance. \n“I did not put well,” he said. “I could not figure out the speed of the green consistently.” \nBender rallied on the front nine, registering seven pars and a 39. The player drove the ball well, according to Warrior Run coach Brad Peace. \nSears opened with a birdie on the par-four, 380-yard second hole, but could never find his groove. On the next hole, another par four at 347 yards, he registered the first of 10 bogeys. \n“Putting killed me,” said Sears, who added a double-bogey on No. 7 and finished with six three-puts. “I knew the greens were big and quick.” \nSears posted an identical score in a practice round Sunday, according to Selinsgrove coach Lonnie Groce. \n“We thought Logan was going to come around,” the coach said. “But this was a tough golf course, and he faced a lot of good competition.” \nAlbert accomplished her goal of improving on last year’s fourth-place finish in the District 4 tournament. \n“I played all right,” she said. “It wasn’t my best, but it wasn’t bad. The pin placements were difficult.” Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:13:02.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
