But Berdych saved the set point and then converted his second match point with a forehand return for his first title of the season. \nBerdych lost in three finals this season - in Doha, Rotterdam and Monte Carlo - and now heads to China Open where he’s seeded second. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:09:54.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
