FOLEY Associated Press \nIOWA CITY (AP) — Former NFL and Iowa safety Tyler Sash died from an accidental overdose after mixing two powerful pain medications, and a history of painful injuries was a contributing factor, a medical examiner said Tuesday. \nAdditional studies will look at whether Sash, 27, suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease caused by repetitive trauma that has been found in several former NFL players. The results will be available in eight to 12 months, according to a statement from the Iowa State Medical Examiner’s office. \nSash, a standout safety at Iowa who won a Super Bowl during with the New York Giants in 2012, was found dead at his home in Oskaloosa on Sept. 8. An autopsy was conducted the next day, but the results weren’t clear until laboratory results were completed. \nThe autopsy determined the cause and manner of death was an “accidental mixed drug toxicity involving methadone and hydrocodone,” the office said Tuesday. Both are legal narcotics used to relieve severe pain, but are also highly addictive. \nThe medical examiner said that a recent shoulder dislocation and a history of chronic shoulder pain suffered by Sash also were “significant conditions” in the death. \nIowa coach Kirk Ferentz told reporters Tuesday that he was “very sorry to learn about” Sash’s cause of death. \n“His passing has been a very, very sad thing,” Ferentz said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:33:07.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
