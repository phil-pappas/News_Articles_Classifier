The forward pass beats you a lot quicker than the run does. \n\"There have been games where you have gone into it knowing you are going to be in lighter spacing and we would rather give up a four- or five-yard run than a 20-yard chunk play on a pass. That is not the case, and it has been a few times. It is probably the biggest issue that we deal with here. \n\"I know there were some growing pains going to a new system and having new faces in the front seven again this year, but it is something that we will always emphasize and always strive to be better. I truly believe when you can stop the run when you want to, then that is going to open up so much more for your pass rush and your ability to defend it.\" \nPettine said on Wednesday that the Browns needed to play with desire for four quarters against the St. Louis Rams or they would get embarrassed by a team that is averaging 119 yards per game and 4.8 yards per carry. \nDefensive coordinator Jim O'Neil agreed that such a desire was necessary for the Browns to improve against the run. \n\"Anytime in any part of this game, if you don't bring an attitude and a want-to, you can get embarrassed,\" O'Neil said. \"You can get embarrassed as a player. You can get embarrassed as a coach. You have to bring it every Sunday, and usually, you have to have a great week and build momentum to get to Sunday. We talk to our guys about building that fire throughout the week. You have to get yourself ready to roll and ready to explode come Sunday when we kick off. \n\"I wouldn't say it's been an issue. I think that we need to be consistent with it for four quarters.\" \nDespite suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee last November while playing for the University of Georgia, St. Louis rookie Todd Gurley was the No. 10 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, and the Rams quickly made him a focal point of their future plans. \nKnowing Gurley would spend all of the offseason and much of training camp working his way back from surgery, their patience has paid off. After missing the first two games of the season and gaining just nine yards on six carries in his first NFL game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Gurley has rushed for 146 and 159 yards in back-to-back outings. \nThe 159-yard effort at the Green Bay Packers was the fourth-highest single-game rushing yardage total this year, and his 146-yard showing in a win over Arizona is tied for seventh. \nGurley is averaging 5.7 yards per carry, the best among all NFL running backs, and he is the only player in the league to record two carries of at least 50 yards. He broke 50-yard runs in each of the last two weeks, and his five runs of 20 or more yards are tied for the second-most in the NFL this year. \nGurley has gained 314 yards on 55 carries, and in the fourth quarter of games, his five runs of 10 or more yards are tied for the most in the NFL. \n\"He's big. He's strong. He breaks tackles. He's a good football player, a very good football player,\" O'Neil said. \n\"They're doing a good job running the football. Their offensive coordinator is very creative with the different run schemes that they're doing. They get the ball into a lot of guys' hands. It's not just Gurley. He's a dynamic back and he's electrified that offense since he's been back. They've got a stable: (Tre) Mason, (Benny) Cunningham, they use (receiver) Tavon Austin as a running back. \n\"It's going to be a challenge for our guys. We have to play with great eye discipline. We have to do a great job attacking the line of scrimmage. We have to do a great job tackling. They've got guys that are very good players in space. It's going to be a challenge. We've talked about it all week. We have to show up Sunday with the right mentality, and we have to execute.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LSmDPS TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:19:17.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
