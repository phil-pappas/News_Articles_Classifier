Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel took third place a mere 0.5 of a second behind.\nHamilton had needed to beat Vettel by nine points and Rosberg by two to take the crown, but for much of the race it looked as if he would have to wait at least until Mexico next weekend.\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin , editing by Martyn Herman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:50:02.628+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
