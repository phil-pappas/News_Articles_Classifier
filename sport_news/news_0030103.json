Larry Hogan has declared a state of emergency to allow emergency responders to begin to prepare for flooding from heavy rains and damage from a hurricane.\nThe governor spoke Thursday from the Maryland Emergency Management Agency in Reisterstown.\nRecent storms have swamped parts of the East Coast. The approach of Hurricane Joaquin (wah-KEEN') could intensify the damage.\nThe storm was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane Thursday afternoon and was pounding the Bahamas.

Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency for the entire state to help prepare for a possible thrashing by Hurricane Joaquin.\nRain and wind from the Category 3 storm threaten to pummel the state this weekend.\nMcCrory says his declaration allows exceptions to weight and time restrictions on trucks while also giving him added authority to respond to trouble.\nMcCrory says Outer Banks towns are facing special risks because rain there has been coming nearly nonstop for a week followed by a weekend nor'easter that's chewed up protective sand dunes.\nMcCrory says up to 10 inches of rain could fall in parts of the state's western mountains and foothills, and that water pouring downhill could cause damage to communities there.\n12:10 p.m.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has declared a state of emergency ahead of a storm expected to bring heavy rain and flooding.

Navy officials say this is the most intensive storm preparation effort the base has had since Hurricane Ernesto in 2006.\nThe installation is in a low-lying area adjacent to the Elizabeth River and Willoughby Bay. It's not uncommon for streets on the base to flood during storms.\nNaval Station Norfolk is home to aircraft carriers, submarines and destroyers, among other ships. The base is also home to numerous command headquarters and support buildings.\n11:40 a.m.\nParts of South Carolina have seen 5 or more inches of rain fall in a drenching storm that flooded and closed roads, submerged cars and made for a hazardous commute.\nOfficials in Spartanburg County say one person died Thursday morning in the street flooding.
