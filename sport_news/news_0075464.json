Cristiano plays offensively on the left side, Messi centrally. I play up front. Of course I work back, take part in combinations and don’t wait 90 minutes for the ball. I want to participate in the game. I am 27 and I want to be better every year, score more goals. My best time comes now. Hopefully, it will carry on as long as possible! To be a striker, sometimes it is not easy. To reach the crucial situations, I have to fight in every game.\n“My colleagues also take an important role. You are running, see the chance, but you do not get the ball. But you have to stay positive and concentrate fully.” The striker also spoke of his training schedule and what makes him one of the feared forwards in the world but added it was too early to comment on whether he can bag the European Golden Shoe. “I am working very hard, with the team, in every training session and after training. In my position I have to fight, also with the defenders. Of course, technique is above everything but strength is also important for me. I must always be on the move and fight for my place in the box, outside the box I must combine with my teammates. For me the work already starts during my leisure time. It’s not just football, many other things play a big role. “When I was 18-19 years old I was very small and slim. I knew that it was not enough if I wanted to compete on an international level,” Lewandowski said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:57:47.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
