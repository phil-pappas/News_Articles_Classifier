The nomination was rescinded Monday.\n The Boston Herald reports that White House officials say Scott asked that her nomination be withdrawn for personal reasons.\nScott resigned abruptly from the MBTA in February. The agency was heavily criticized by commuters and politicians for its poor performance during winter storms that dumped more than 7 feet of snow on the region. The snow caused massive delays and forced the MBTA to shut down subway and commuter rail service several times.\nScott left the job in April.\n___\nThis story corrects MBTA to eliminate transposed letters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:11:52.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
