He was scheduled for an MRI today. \nThe second devastating home loss of the season was also the fourth straight defeat for Kansas City (1-4). \nThe Chiefs were leading, 17-3, in the third quarter when Charles went down while trying to make a cut. \n\"Charles is one of the tougher guys in the NFL, so I’m thinking he’s going to get up,\" backup running back Charcandrick West said. \"It brought tears to my eyes. It’s heartbreaking.\" \nWith Charles out, the Bears (2-3) quickly seized the momentum. \nPATRIOTS 30, COWBOYS 6 (at Arlington, Texas) — Tom Brady threw for two touchdowns and added a 1-yard plunge for another score, as New England (4-0) had little trouble containing a Dallas offense minus Tony Romo and Dez Bryant. \nBrady guided two long touchdown drives in the second half after getting sacked five times before halftime, including once each by Greg Hardy and Rolando McClain in their returns from four-game suspensions. \nBRONCOS 16, RAIDERS 10 (at Oakland, Calif.) — Chris Harris Jr. returned a fourth-quarter interception 74 yards for a touchdown and Denver (5-0) overcame a shaky day from Peyton Manning to beat Oakland (2-3). \nManning was intercepted twice by 1998 draft classmate Charles Woodson and failed to lead the Broncos to an offensive touchdown for the second time in five games this season. \nCARDINALS 42, LIONS 17 (at Detroit) — Carson Palmer threw for three touchdowns, Matthew Stafford was benched after throwing a third interception, and Arizona routed Detroit. \nThe Cardinals (4-1) have a two-game lead in the NFC West. \nThe Lions (0-5) have the dubious distinction of being the NFL’s only winless team and are off to their worst start since becoming the league’s only 0-16 team in 2008. \nPACKERS 24, RAMS 10 (at Green Bay, Wis.) — Aaron Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and 241 yards, but his impressive string of not being intercepted at Lambeau Field ended. \nRodgers was 19 of 30 for 241 yards with long scoring strikes to receivers Ty Montgomery and James Jones. But NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis’ diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3). \nPackers defensive tackle B.J. Raji, the former Westwood star, injured his groin in the first quarter and did not return. \nEAGLES 39, SAINTS 17 (at Philadelphia) — Sam Bradford overcame two red-zone interceptions and threw for 333 yards and two touchdowns and Fletcher Cox forced two fumbles on sacks. \nRyan Mathews and DeMarco Murray each rushed for touchdowns to help the Eagles (2-3) break out of their offensive slump. Drew Brees had three turnovers leading to 17 points for Philadelphia as the Saints fell to 1-4. \nBUCCANEERS 38, JAGUARS 31 (at Tampa, Fla.) — Doug Martin ran for 123 yards and scored three touchdowns, helping Jameis Winston rebound from his worst pro performance. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:26:36.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
