Fisher filed for divorce from his wife, Candace, in March.\nThe person said Fisher traveled to Los Angeles after practice Saturday to see his children and the altercation happened that night while Fisher was attending a gathering at the home of Gloria Govan, Barnes' estranged wife.\nSources told The Post that Barnes became incensed when his 6-year-old twin sons, Carter and Isaiah, called to tell him that Fisher was at the house. \"Barnes went crazy. He got in his car and went to the house and went after Fisher,\" one source said. \"Matt then drove down there to beat the (expletive) out of him.\" Govan is one of the stars of \"Basketball Wives LA\" on VH1.\nFisher missed practice Monday — the team announced at the time it was for personal reasons — and led the Knicks in their exhibition opener Wednesday night against a Brazilian club team.\n\"My state of mind is that we have a game tonight and nothing that I've experienced has anything to do with how we perform tonight,\" Fisher said before the game, adding that he was \"completely focused and committed to the team.\"\n\"I'm not distracted in any way,\" he said.\nFisher and Barnes were teammates with the Los Angeles Lakers from 2010-12.\n\"We are aware and currently gathering information regarding today's report involving Matt Barnes,\" the Grizzlies said in a statement. \"We have no further comment at this time.\"\nFisher said he told his players about the situation when he gathered them before the game because he wanted them to hear about it from him directly.\nFisher is in his second season with the Knicks after spending most of his playing career in Los Angeles.\nMark your calendars. The Knicks play the Grizzlies on Jan. 16 in Memphis.\nContact Brent Axe: Email | Twitter\nInformation from the Associated Press was used in this report", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/brentaxemedia", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/07/matt-barnes-attacks-knicks-coach-fisher-for-dating-ex-wife/", "http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/new-york-knicks-memphis-grizzlies-matt-barnes-derek-fisher-attack-attacked-for-dating-his-ex-wife-100715", "http://espn.go.com/losangeles/nba/story/_/id/13832349/derek-fisher-newyork-knicks-matt-barnes-memphis-grizzlies-scuffle-party"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:29:31.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
