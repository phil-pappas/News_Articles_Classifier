Ernie Arizzi. Gary Collins. Do any of these names ring a bell? \nTo most people, probably not. But to Maryland football fanatics, these names bring up memories of the past. All three were stars on the 1961 Terps football team, and the current Terps will pay homage to the '61 squad on Saturday when they rock their \"Maryland Pride 1961 Throwback Uniforms \" against the Nittany Lions. Introducing the throwbacks we'll wear against Penn State this weekend: http://t.co/jjnsIn3zId #UAFlashback pic.twitter.com/idvYPfKIvL â€” Maryland Football (@MarylandPride) October 19, 2015 \nSaturday's uniforms commemorate the 1961 team, the first Terps team to beat Penn State. The Terps defeated Penn State 21-17 on November 4, 1961 in College Park and went on to finish the '61 season with a 7-3 record which included a win over seventh-ranked Syracuse. \nUp until Maryland's 20-19 victory over the Nittany Lions in 2014, the 1961 triumph was the lone win for the Terps against Penn State. \nSaturday's game marks the first contest under interim head coach Mike Locksley, who was named to the position on October 11 after former head coach Randy Edsall was relieved of his duties . The Terps (2-4) will be looking to salvage their season under Locksley and a win against the Nittany Lions (5-2) could go a long way. \nThe game is scheduled to kickoff at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. \nLike this story?
