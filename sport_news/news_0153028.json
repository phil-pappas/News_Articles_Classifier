His dad, Bill, has coached the Comets’ wrestling team for the past 10 years, and his brother, Jake, was a state wrestling finalist in 2014. \nJoe Benedict will lead Sandy Creek (2-2 overall, 2-0 division) into a pivotal road game against division rival Onondaga (4-0, 1-0) at 7 tonight. \n“I think we’re ready to start rolling,” said Benedict, who has tallied 628 yards and 10 touchdowns on 62 carries this season. “We’ve finally gotten the right people in the right positions, and I think things are coming along great.” \nAfter splitting time between the quarterback and tailback positions through a pair of nonleague losses, Sandy Creek coach Mike Stevens said he wanted Benedict to settle into the ace-back role, behind fullback Jarred Baird in the I-Formation entering league play. \nBenedict ran for 209 yards and four touchdowns in a 53-8 victory over Cato-Meridian last Friday, and recorded 208 yards and three rushing scores in a 44-33 win over Weedsport the week prior. \n“That’s where it started to flourish for him, and that’s the same time when our line really started to grow and develop and understand the blocking schemes, and we’ve just taken off from there,” Stevens said. \nBenedict added: “They told me to learn three positions and that’s what I did. I didn’t know where I was going to line up on offense when I came in this year. ... I think everyone is happy with their positions now, our line and fullback have been doing really great and I’ve just been trying to hit the holes hard.” \nWhile emerging as an offensive threat, Benedict has continued his menacing play at the middle linebacker position, which his brother, Jake, also starred in for the Comets. \nHe was among the team’s leading tackler as a freshman last year, and leads the squad with 39 tackles and 19 assists this season. \nStevens described Benedict as the defense’s “play-caller and play-stopper,” and said the Comets’ defensive plan revolves around the 6-foot-1, 195-pound linebacker. \n“He’s going to anchor the middle of the field from hash-mark to hash-mark, and that’s tough on an opposing team,” Stevens said. \nBenedict’s development has been critical for a young Comets team, which entered the season with just one returning starter on offense, and two on defense, including Benedict. \n“That’s filling in a lot of positions for a team in transition, and they had a lot of questions,” Stevens said. “They had questions about where they were playing, what their responsibilities were, and what their techniques were. Now we’re seven or eight weeks in, and they got it.” \nDespite the turnover in talent, the Comets are in position to contend for a spot in their fifth sectional title game in six years. After tonight’s first-place showdown with Onondaga, Sandy Creek’s only remaining divisional opponent is Bishop Grimes (0-4, 0-2). \n“We were ready,” Benedict said. “Our fans and our support, we weren’t sure if they really believed in us. But we did, and we came in over the summer three days a week and just worked to get here.” Commenting rules: Stick to the topic of the article/letter/editorial.
