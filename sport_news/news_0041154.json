It's really hard because we feel like we left something on the field,\" Carr said. \"We feel like we've left wins out there.\" \nOne week after losing on a last-minute field goal in Chicago, the Raiders (2-3) were in position to take the lead against Denver (5-0) twice in the fourth quarter. \nWoodson's second interception set up a 40-yard field goal try that Janikowski missed on the first play of the fourth quarter. After the defense forced a punt, Carr drove the Raiders to the Broncos 31 where they were in position for another field goal to erase a 9-7 deficit. \nInstead, the Broncos blitzed and Carr's short pass over the middle to Seth Roberts was off target. Harris intercepted it and returned it for the touchdown. \n\"We had pressure and I threw the hot and it just didn't work out our way,\" Carr said. \nCarr threw for 249 yards and a 3-yard TD pass to Marcel Reece, but the Raiders lost their eighth straight to the Broncos. \nThose mistakes overshadowed a splendid day from Woodson, who turned 39 on Wednesday and became the oldest player ever to record two interceptions in a game on Sunday. \nHe is one of three players in NFL history with an interception at age 39 or older, joining Hall of Famer Darrell Green and Clay Matthews, Jr. Woodson has 64 interceptions, which is tied with Ed Reed for sixth on the all-time list. \nMaking it even sweeter was the fact it came against Manning, his fellow 1998 draft classmate and the player he beat for the Heisman Trophy in 1997. \n\"Those things are the shiny things, the shiny toys that you like, but it's about wins and losses,\" Woodson said. \"Our mission is to win our division and the only way we can do that is to beat the team that's won it the last few years. Today we dropped the ball on that.\" \nManning finished 22 for 35 for 266 yards but was sacked twice and had two interceptions. Denver ran for only 43 yards but used Harris' interception return and a sack-fumble by Von Miller that set up a field goal to beat the Raiders. This was Denver's second-lowest scoring regular season with Manning as quarterback, ahead of only a seven-point effort last year against St. Louis. \n\"We want to play better offensively,\" Manning said. \"We want to do our job. Somehow, some way it's about getting the Denver Broncos a win. There's no question offensively we want to play better. ... Everybody wants to do a better job and that starts with me.\" \nJanikowski, who set a Raiders record by playing in his 241st game, missed his second field goal of the game from 40 yards after Woodson's second interception, costing Oakland a shot at the lead. Janikowski also had a 38-yard attempt blocked by Sylvester Williams in the first quarter. \n\"He's had many great games and today wasn't one,\" coach Jack Del Rio said. \nThe Broncos managed just two field goals on three trips into the red zone. Brandon McManus added a 52-yard field goal in the third quarter to give Denver the lead for good. \nNOTES: The Broncos won their record 14th straight road game against a division opponent. ... Denver LB DeMarcus Ware left the game with a back injury. ... Raiders DE Justin Tuck left with a shoulder injury. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:40:45.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
