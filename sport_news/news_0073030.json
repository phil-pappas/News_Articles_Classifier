Class 4A District 7 \nWho’s in: West High, Pleasant Valley, Davenport North. \nWhat’s left to decide: West High and Pleasant Valley will play for the district title at Spartan Stadium on Friday. The winner gets a No. 1 seed and potentially two home playoff games, while the loser is district runner-up and will still host an opening-round playoff game. Prep football rewind: West keeps district hopes alive Class 4A District 6 \nWho’s in: Cedar Rapids Washington has clinched the district title and City High has secured a playoff spot. \nWhat’s left to decide: Spots two through four are all up for grabs on Friday. \nCity High can clinch the runner-up spot and a home playoff game with a road win at Muscatine while Cedar Rapids Prairie is guaranteed a spot with a win at Ottumwa. \nIf City High falls at Muscatine and Prairie defeats Ottumwa there would be a three-way tie for second between those three schools, and the tiebreaker criteria would be needed. Class 3A District 4 \nWho’s in: Cedar Rapids Xavier has clinched the district title, Maquoketa has secured the runner-up spot and Solon and Dubuque Wahlert have assured themselves playoff berths. \nWhat’s left to decide: Not much. The winner of Solon and Wahlert’s matchup on Friday is the No. 3 seed; the loser is fourth. Class 3A District 5 \nWho’s in: Washington, Davenport Assumption, Fairfield and Clear Creek Amana. \nWhat’s left to decide: The top four teams in the district meet on Friday to sort out the District 5 seeding. \nWashington and Davenport Assumption play for the district title on Thursday in Davenport. Clear Creek Amana will host Fairfield on Friday with the winner getting the No. 3 seed and the loser the No. 4 seed. Class 2A District 5 \nWho’s in: Central Lee will be the top seed and Williamsburg will be the No. 2 seed while Mid-Prairie and Mediapolis have secured playoff berths. \nWhat’s left to decide: Mid-Prairie hosts Mediapolis on Friday in a battle for the No. 3 seed. Class 1A District 5 \nWho’s in: West Branch, Alburnett and Wilton have all secured playoff spots. \nWhat’s left to decide: West Branch can clinch the district title with a win over Alburnett on Friday. \nA West Branch win over the Pirates would give Wilton the No. 2 seed and Alburnett would get the No. 3 seed. \nThe fourth spot is between Bellevue and North Cedar. Class 1A District 6 \nWho’s in: Regina, Pella Christian and Sigourney/Keota have locked up the top three spots. \nWhat’s left to decide: Regina wins the district title with a win at Pella Christian on Friday. Sigourney/Keota takes the No. 2 seed with a Regina win. Highland can secure the fourth spot with a Eddyville-Blakesburg-Fremont win over Columbus. Class A District 6 \nWho’s in: Pekin, Winfield-Mount Union, \nWhat’s left to decide: Lone Tree can lock up the No. 3 seed with a win over New London on Friday while Pekin and Winfield-Mount Union will meet for the district title. \nRANKINGS UPDATE: Despite a 38-35 loss to Class 3A fourth-ranked Xavier on Friday, Regina remained the top team in Class 1A in the latest rankings released by The Des Moines Register on Saturday . \nWest Branch (8-0) remained second in Class 1A after a 55-14 win over Wilton. \nThe other No. 1 teams remained the same as West Des Moines Dowling Catholic (4A), Pella (3A), Albia (2A), BGM (A) and Don-Bosco (eight-player) all held onto the top spots. \nReach Ryan Murken at 319-339-7369 or rmurken@press-citizen.com or follow him on Twitter at @rmmurken.
