Platini, a former French midfield star, says the money was for services he provided under contract over a number of years. \nFIFA on Tuesday held open the possibility that Platini may still be able to run for president if he wins an appeal against his suspension. \nThe only other candidates to register so far are Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein and former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid. Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain, the Asian soccer chief, said he had been urged to stand but was still gauging opinion. \nFIFA has been criticized for its secrecy over salaries for its leaders, and the reform plan says those details should be made public. It also calls for more independent members of FIFA's finance and development committees, and a fully independent audit and compliance committee made up of experts. \nIt said there should be increased positions for women in the new FIFA Council, with each of the six continental confederations to give \"at least one voting FIFA Council seat for women\". \n($1 = 0.9531 Swiss francs) \n(Additional reporting by Brian Homewood ; Editing by Mark Trevelyan ) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:10:14.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
