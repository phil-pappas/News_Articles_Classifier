(AP) - The Mississippi auditor says Madison County has been improperly collecting tax for several years to provide fire protection in part of the county.\nAuditor Stacey Pickering on Friday told The Clarion-Ledger ( http://on.thec-l.com/1W9QQLq ) his staff found the error during a routine examination of spending.\nA tax has been collected since 2008, when the county built a new fire station to protect about 30,000 residents in an area previously covered by a volunteer fire department.\nWhen the new station was built, the county increased property tax to cover the cost. State law allows such a tax to be set, but a referendum is required unless the fire district existed before 1987.\nMadison County Administrator Mark Houston says officials thought no referendum was needed. A vote is now planned for next spring.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
