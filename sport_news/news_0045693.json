But Phillips' 3-4 defense was unproven with the current roster.\nThe Broncos, playing in the 4-3 for Ware's first season in Denver, were good. But they could have been better. And they were far from being a defense that ranked No. 1 in multiple categories, like the 1977 Orange Crush.\nDenver Broncos defenders Danny Trevathan, Sylvester Williams and DeMarcus Ware teamed up to tackle Minnesota's Adrian Peterson in the second quarter against the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Oct. 5, 2015. ( Steve Nehf, The Denver Post ) However four games into the 2015 season, Ware's ambitious claim is, so far, coming to fruition. The Broncos' defense has carried the Peyton Manning-led team to a 4-0 start, wreaking havoc on opposing offenses and recording an NFL-high 18 sacks.\nBut the Broncos' efficiency on defense extends further. Here's a numerical breakdown of their work:\n• Ware and fellow outside linebacker Von Miller have 25 and 24 quarterback pressures (sacks, hits and hurries combined), respectively. They lead the league, according to Pro Football Focus.\n• Denver opponents were 0-of-19 on third-and-8 plays or longer until Teddy Bridgewater's 11-yard scramble (on third-and-10) for a first down late in the first half of Sunday's 23-20 victory over Minnesota .\nAdvertisement • Eleven players have at least one sack, the most in team history. The Broncos' previous high of nine was in 1984.\n• Ware has a league-high 4&frac12; sacks. He is the only player this season to record at least one in every game.\n• Inside linebacker Brandon Marshall, who is playing with two screws in his foot (one of which is broken), leads the Broncos with 33 total tackles (27 solo), including six tackles for a loss.\n• Against the Vikings, safety T.J. Ward became the second defensive back in Broncos history to have two sacks and a forced fumble in a game. Safety John Lynch was the first, in 2005, against San Diego.\n• The Broncos' 11 total takeaways are tied for second-most in the NFL and have led to 31 points. Their three red-zone takeaways are tied for the most in the league.\n• The Broncos have allowed 4.37 yards per play, fewest in the NFL. The league average is 5.49.\n• Their 25 percent opponent conversion rate on third-down plays is the lowest in the NFL. League average: 39.3 percent.\n• Denver has forced its opponents into 38 plays for negative yards (second-most in the NFL, behind St. Louis' 40) for a league-most 154 yards lost.\nCHEW ON THIS • Watch Troy Renck's Denver Broncos Week 5 report .\n• See where Peyton Manning landed on this week's NFL quarterback rankings .\n• A preview of the Oakland Raiders , the Broncos' opponent on Sunday.\n• Nolan Arenado was named the September National League player of the month .\n• Five years ago today, Roy Halladay of Arvada West High pitched the second no-hitter in Major League postseason history during Game 1 of the NLDS against the Cincinnati Reds.\n• The Colorado Avalanche, formerly the Quebec Nordiques, played its first game in Denver's McNichols Sports Arena 20 years ago and defeated the Detroit Red Wings, 3-2.\n• On this day in 1993, Michael Jordan retired from the NBA for the first time. Four months later, he signed a minor-league contract with the Chicago White Sox.", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1006/20151006_105715_denver-broncos-defense_200.jpg", "https://youtu.be/wWgTPms9-Jo"], "published": "2015-10-06T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:06:23.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
