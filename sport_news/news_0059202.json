Reynolds, who will have extra time to rest since Navy has a bye next \nSaturday, did not hesitate when asked if he’ll be able to go against the Green Wave. \n“Absolutely,” he responded. \nBackup fullback Quentin Ezell rushed for 75 yards and two touchdowns on just six carries for Navy (4-1), which committed two costly fumbles deep in its own territory. The Midshipmen moved the ball whether Reynolds or backup Tago Smith was directing the triple-option, amassing 318 rushing yards. \n“We’re all disappointed, but we know we still have plenty of goals on our chart. This is a bummer, but we just have to get back to work, clean some things up and get ready for conference play,” defensive captain Bernie Sarra said. \nReynolds seconded that assessment and said Navy’s motto of always looking to go 1-0 still applies. “That’s our thing and it’s true win or lose. So we’re back to 0-0 and we just have to get prepared for Tulane,” he said. \nNavy could not have started the game any better, forcing Notre Dame into a three-and-out on the game’s opening possession then scoring a touchdown on its first offensive opportunity. \nOutside linebacker D.J. Palmore got pressure on Kizer on consecutive plays, forcing an incompletion and a completion for no gain and the Fighting Irish had to punt. \nNavy took over on its own 30-yard line and Reynolds immediately ripped off a 51-yard run, taking an option keeper to the right then cutting back off a great block by Joey Gaston and racing all the way to the Notre Dame 19-yard line. Two plays later, slotback Toneo Gulley took a pitchout and raced 13 yards for a touchdown that gave Navy a 7-0 lead with just 2:12 elapsed. \nNotre Dame answered immediately, marching 75 yards in 12 plays to tie the score. Kizer completed passes of 25 yards to Prosise and 18 yards to wide receiver Chris Brown then scored himself on 1-yard plunge. \nAn outstanding punt by Tyler Newsome backed Navy up on its own 3-yard line early in the third quarter. On third down, fullback Chris Swain mishandled an easy pitch and the resulting fumble was recovered by linebacker Jaylon Smith at the 7-yard line. Prosise needed just one play to give the Irish a 14-7 lead, racing untouched around the left end on a sweep. \n“You can’t turn the ball over, especially inside the red zone,” Reynolds added. \nNavy went three-and-out on its next possession with Reynolds getting hurt on a third down run. Kizer then connected with Fuller for a 30-yard scoring strike as the Irish moved ahead, 21-7 with 7:10 left in the first half. Kizer scrambled toward the sideline to gain time then threw on the run to a wide-open Fuller, who scooted the final four yards into the end zone. \nThat drive was aided by a roughing the passer penalty on nose guard Bernie Sarra and featured an apparent forced fumble and recovery by cornerback Brendon Clements that was overturned on review. \nSmith replaced Reynolds and proceeded to lead a pair of touchdown drives that Ezell finished in fine form. \nSmith got the first drive going with a 22-yard run and two plays later Ezell burst through a big hole on the right side and racing untouched into the end zone for a 45-yard touchdown to cut the deficit to 21-14. \nClements made a nice interception on the ensuing possession, stepping in front of the intended receiver at the last moment. That set up a 22-yard touchdown trot by Ezell, who went off-tackle and rumbled down the left sideline before diving over the goal line to tie the score at 21. \nKicker Justin Yoon gave Notre Dame a 24-21 halftime lead by drilling a 52-yard field goal that was third-longest in program history. \nNavy got the ball to start the second half with an opportunity to take the lead, but Dishan Romine fumbled while returning the opening kickoff and it was recovered by cornerback Devin Butler. \nThe Fighting Irish once again took advantage of the turnover deep in enemy territory with Prosise bolting 22 yards for his second touchdown to make it 31-21 with just 44 seconds elapsed in the third period. \n“We felt good coming out of halftime. We’re in good shape. We’re down three. We deferred on purpose in order to get the ball to start the second half,” Niumatalolo said. “That opening kickoff took the wind out of our sails. You can’t turn the ball over deep in your own territory. We did it twice and it led to 14 points.” \nNavy kicker Austin Grebe missed wide left on a 45-yard field goal attempt and Notre Dame added to its lead with a 10-play, 73-yard touchdown march. Prosise got the payoff, scoring from 11 yards out on a very determined run to put the home team ahead, 38-21. \nNavy converted on fourth down twice on its next possession, but ultimately had to settle for a 40-yard field goal by Grebe that made the score 38-24. Notre Dame answered with a field goal of its own to restore the 17-point lead with Yoon good from 36 yards away. \nSmith returned at quarterback on the next Navy possession as head coach Ken Niumatalolo elected to rest Reynolds for the final 9:40 of the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:30:52.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
