JAE C. HONG , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Related article » PLAYA VISTA â\" Luc Mbah a Moute surveyed the NBA landscape, looking at his options, trying to find the right staff with the right team â\" the right situation for him.\nThis is what free agents do all over the NBA, and Mbah a Moute thought he found the fit.\nIt wasnât the Clippers. It was Sacramento.\nBut through a bizarre series of events, Mbah a Moute didnât get the team he wanted, instead finding himself starting the season without a clear path for minutes on the Clippers, an NBA title contender.\nâThings usually work out one way or another and usually not how you expect it,â he said before the Clippersâ practice Sunday. âIâm just glad for the opportunity to be on this team. This team has a chance to be something special, and to be a part of it would be special. Iâm glad it worked out for me.â\nMbah a Moute secured the Clippersâ final available roster spot, beating out veteran forward Chuck Hayes.\nClippers head coach and president of basketball operations Doc Rivers didnât pull Mbah a Moute to the side to let him know he made the team. Rivers said nothing, and in this case, the silence was the good news.\nâThey didnât tell me I was gone â¦ so I just show up for work,â Mbah a Moute said with a grin. âThey didnât tell me I canât be here anymore, so Iâm here.â\nRivers said the decision came down to Mbah a Mouteâs presence on one end of the floor.\nâI just think he can defend,â Rivers said. âHeâs one of those guys that can be a great team defender.â\nMbah a Mouteâs deal becomes guaranteed for the entire season Jan.10.\nHe ended up with the Clippers after the Kings voided Mbah a Mouteâs deal with the team, claiming he failed his physical because of a shoulder injury.\nâI mean, Iâve been healthy,â he said. âItâs never been a limitation for me. You have to go ask the people at Sacramento.â\nHowever, Mbah a Moute and the players union filed a grievance against the Kings, and following arbitration in September, the two sides are negotiating.\nâThereâs a reason I picked Sacramento,â Mbah a Moute said. âI felt like it was going to be a good situation for me. Iâm not glad it happened, but in life, you canât control everything that happens. You can control what you can do. Iâm glad I fell here, and Iâm excited about this team and the season to come.â\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwsz86-b88549863z.120151025180728000g09cpj5d.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwsz86-b88549863z.120151025180728000g09cpj5d.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:31:06.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
