(Mark D. Smith-USA TODAY Sports) By John ShinnThe Norman (Okla.) Transcript \nAny chances of the making radical offensive changes were doused by Bob Stoops this week. He reaffirmed the return of the Air Raid offense was a long-term decision. \nDon’t expect to see two tight ends and a fullback become mainstays of this offense. \nThe Sooners have an offensive identity playing mostly with four receivers and a running back. That is the offense Lincoln Riley came to coordinate. \n“It’s just been inconsistent,” Stoops said. “We’re working on that.” \nThere are issues that need to be worked out before No. 19 OU (4-1, 1-1 Big 12) faces Kansas State (3-2, 0-2) at 2:30 p.m. Saturday. \nThe offensive changes the Sooners made were massive. The only thing they did well in 2014 was run the ball. They did it mostly with brawn in front of running back Samaje Perine. \nThe Sooners are no longer built to muscle their way through defenses. That issue was revealed before the Texas game. OU is averaging 2.5 yards less per carry than last season. It has no chance of equaling last season’s total of 3,395 yards. For one, it’s allowed six more sacks in five games than it did in 13 last season. \nBut Perine hasn’t been nearly as effective either. He’s averaging 60 yards less rushing yards per game. \nTo the sophomore’s credit, he understood the offense shift was coming. The changeover in the offensive line with the graduation of Tyrus Thompson, Daryl Williams and Adam Shead was noticeable. Those were five-year players that all weighed over 330 pounds. \nTheir replacements — Orlando Brown, Josiah St. John and Jonathan Alvarez — are not slight. But they’ve all spent less than three years in OU’s weight program. \nThe blocking schemes have changed. Not a bunch, but slightly. \n“Obviously, we don’t have the size that we had last year in the front line, but the holes are there,” Perine said. “As backs, we have to do a better job of getting there. We read too quickly and one thing doesn’t go right. But in reality, the hole is right there. We just have to hit it.” \nStruggling to get yards on the ground, coupled with sacks and penalties, have placed more yards on quarterback Baker Mayfield and the receivers. Every mistake gets magnified when the Sooners are habitually in third-and-long situations because of ineffective plays on prior downs. \nThe Sooners’ pace is the biggest issue to players. They’ve run less than 70 plays the last two games. Against West Virginia, big plays fueled the touchdowns. Texas made OU string together their longest drives of the season to score. \n“The drives that we actually were successful on is when we went up-tempo,” Mayfield said. “They had their base defense and they were tired. They were in their base defense and we were able to execute. We have to go out there and play a little faster every drive and have that intensity.” \nThe buzzwords around OU’s offensive players is “11-man football.” It’s used to describe what it should look like when everything works in unison. One player gets out of sync and everything crashes to a halt. \nAgainst Texas, the rhythm was off enough that OU couldn’t overcome it. \n“That’s symptomatic of a team that’s doing this for the first year,” Riley said. “I’m not using it as a crutch. It just is what it is. We’re not as consistent as we need to be.” \nBut wide-spread offensive changes are not going to be made. Stoops picked this offense because of its long-term success. He is sticking with it. \nThe Norman Transcript, www.normantranscript.com .
