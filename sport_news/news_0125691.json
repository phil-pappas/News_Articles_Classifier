Individually, Lightfoot is third in America East in digs per set (4.24) and second in league tilts (4.68). Her presence in the backcourt has powered UNH's conference-best .172 opponent hitting percentage this season. The senior is the program's all-time leader in digs, scooping up 1,524 digs in her career as a Wildcat.
