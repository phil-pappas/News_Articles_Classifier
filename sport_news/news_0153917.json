Two deputies placed him in restraints and put him in a gooseneck hold. His wrist was injured again in the process.\nDespite numerous complaints about abdominal pain, his treatment did not commence until Dec. 2, 2013 and continued until March 2014.\nWhen Kulhanek evaluated Zartner, she did nothing about his abdominal pain, but did say the handcuffs were too tight.\nAnother hand doctor later diagnosed nerve damage to his hand, the lawsuit says. A series of surgeries to Zartner's wrists were performed in 2015.\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or @kirkmitchell or denverpost.com/coldcases", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:57:11.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
