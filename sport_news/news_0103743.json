That’s always going to be the goal. Whether we get there or not, it depends on us and what we do and how we do it, but that’s always our big-picture goal.”\nPerhaps that’s why Anthony appears so patient.\nHe’s 31 years old, an age when few top players are interested in a gradual building process. But Anthony doesn’t seem disappointed or dispirited, and he certainly hasn’t been demanding – at least, not publicly.\n“What I see in Melo is how he feels personally, good or bad, about anything, I think he will say it if he feels like he needs to say it, but when he doesn’t feel like it needs to be said, or people publicly need to know what he’s feeling or how he’s thinking, he doesn’t say it,” Knicks coach Derek Fisher said. “And I think that says a lot about who he is.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:50:49.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
