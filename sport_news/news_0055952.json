But it could not break the deadlock and succumbed to its first defeat on home soil since a 5-1 reverse to Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League last November.\nIt was smash and grab for Olympiacos, which was mostly restricted to shots from distance but made its best opening count when Ideye scored for the third match in a row to snatch the points.\nThe Greeks now look well placed to qualify from Group F with six points from their three fixtures and a home clash with the Croatians to follow.\nDinamo may argue it deserved more, having dominated the opening stages, with Rog particularly threatening. The winger did brilliantly down the left to beat his man but Siovas cleared for Olympiacos with nobody attacking the cross.\nEl Arbi Soudani then attacked down the opposite wing and cut inside to open up a sight of goal, only to waste the chance and shoot well wide, before the Algerian set up Junior Fernandes, who shot straight at Dinamo goalkeeper Roberto.\nDinamo then put together the finest move of the match but the flowing attack came to a stuttering end when Soudani picked out Armin Hodzic in the box, but the striker was well marshalled by the determined Olympiacos defense and failed to get a shot away.\nOlympiacos was being restricted to shots from distance, with Arthur Masuaku forcing Dinamo keeper Eduardo into his first action of the game on the half hour with a swerving strike from distance, but the goalkeeper was alert to the danger.\nBoth sides opened up after the cagey first half and Dinamo skipper Antolic should have opened the scoring shortly after the break, but with the hosts suddenly four-on-two, his shot hit the outside of the post.\nOlympiacos ought to have compounded that error immediately but Ideye could not convert a low cross from Pardo with Eduardo stranded.\nKostas Fortounis slashed wildly off target from distance as the Greeks committed more men forward in their attacks and Ideye atoned for his earlier miss by scoring a fine solo goal, beating Eduardo from near the byline after chasing down a long pass over the top.\nDinamo threw men forward but could not find a late response and its qualification chances now look slim.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:53:08.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
