The following are a few takeaways from Saturday's win. Streak comes to an end \nThe Utes haven't beaten the Sun Devils since 1976 — nearly a 40-year drought for Utah. And since joining the Pac-12, Utah has seemingly played second fiddle to Arizona State each season. While the last two seasons have been close matchups, Utah has never been able to get over the figurative hump. \nBut Saturday's win was an unleashing of a lengthy streak that was meant to be broken eventually. Many saw Arizona State as the trendy team to upset Utah, given its ability to stop the run and force teams, namely Utah, to beat them through the air. And that's exactly what Utah did. Travis Wilson managed the never-ending Arizona State blitz packages and simply beat the Sun Devils with his arm. \nOnce Utah saw a weakness in the run defense, they exploited it perfectly and executed the read-option that dialed in Devontae Booker for a 25-yard rushing touchdown. While the offense had moments of questionable play, it was executed well enough to come away with a 16-point victory. Defense came to play \nUtah's defense was turned up to another level Saturday night. Collectively, the defense sacked Arizona State quarterback Mike Bercovici five times, had 11 tackles for loss, nine pass breakups and one interception. But most importantly, Utah's defense didn't allow Arizona State to get in the end zone all night. \nThe score at the end of the night was deceiving, considering Arizona State ended with 18 points. But most of that was not on the defense, but on special teams play. Utah's defense is not one to be messed with at this point in the season. They mesh well as a team and give up little to opposing offenses. So, special teams? \nAfter so much praise for the special teams this season, the group took a massive step back and nearly cost Utah the game. Save a Tom Hackett shoe-lace tackle, the Sun Devils would have scored two touchdowns on separate returns. The kickoff coverage, too, was terrible and seemingly lacked effort. Bad angles and arm tackles were simply not enough against Arizona State. \nAnd then there was the bizarre trick play attempt from Britain Covey to Bubba Poole in the end zone. Sure, had the play been executed perfectly it would have looked brilliant, but it wasn't and it wasn't a smart decision. That botched trick play was reminiscent to Kaelin Clay's dropped touchdown against Oregon last season in terms of being a momentum-changing outcome. Fortunately for Utah, the team regrouped and fought back, but it was not a good effort from a normally decent group. \nHead coach Kyle Whittingham called the special teams effort \"atrocious,\" which is absolutely fair. If Utah wants to continue its so-called special season, it needs to immediately get better in special teams. No longer can you rest on the laurels of normally fantastic kicking and return guys that can take it to the house. \nP.S. Tom Hackett gets a pass, because he kept special teams alive for Utah, and he's a really good punter.
