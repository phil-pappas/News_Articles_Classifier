Six of Golden Valley’s drives ended in three-and-outs, and two ended with turnovers. \nIn addition to Speights, Valencia routinely brought pressure with its two returning All-Santa Clarita Valley defensive ends, Jermaine Brown and Tayler Manuel. \n“It’s a team loss here. Offensively we put our defense in some tough spots,” said Golden Valley head coach Dan Kelley. \nIn the first half, it was pretty much all defense for both teams. Valencia cashed in a Victor Corona interception with an Effie Davalos 3-yard touchdown run to take a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter. \nLater in the first, a Grizzlies’ muffed punt helped set up Kevin Neitzke 30-yard field goal to extend the lead to 10-0. \nNeitzke nailed three kicks in the game, also adding a 29-yarder later in the first half and a 39-yarder in the second half. \nValencia held a 13-0 advantage at the break, unable to get much going offensively against an also-stout Golden Valley defense. \n“They were still right there in the game. We didn’t separate ourselves enough,” said Valencia head coach Larry Muir. “In the second half, I was proud of our guys. We stepped it up and played a little faster, a little tougher, a little smarter.” \nThe game was effectively put away in the third quarter when Vikings quarterback Cole Parkinson found Drew Rivello open for a 54-yard pass to the end zone. That made it a 23-0 lead, and it jumped to 30-0 a few minutes later when Parkinson found Tim Wiggins for another scoring pass. \nAfter nursing an injury earlier in the week, backup Aaron Thomas started the game under center for the Vikings but only played the opening series. \nParkinson completed 14-of-20 passes for 175 yards and the two scores. Valencia’s Jahmar Berkley was the game’s leading rusher with 62 yards on 11 carries, the final of which was a 34-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter to set the final score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:37:48.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
