I think it's only going to benefit us.\"\nThe buzz was already starting to build Sunday. Catcher David Ross was walking to the park for the off-day workout when he was spotted on the street.\n\"I got a couple of people that just started clapping for me and stuff,\" Ross said. \"It's going to be exciting. Everybody is really, really worked up, so that's good.\"\nJake Arrieta on Game 3, Sunday's breakfast spread Cubs starting pitcher Jake Arrieta on returning to Wrigley Field for Game 3, Sunday's breakfast spread, his confidence.\nCubs starting pitcher Jake Arrieta on returning to Wrigley Field for Game 3, Sunday's breakfast spread, his confidence.\nSee more videos Ross has been there before. He won a World Series with the Red Sox in 2013, and a long October run at Wrigley would make for a nice bookend.\n\"This is the mecca,\" he said. \"I got a chance to be in another museum of baseball in Fenway and this is right there. I'm excited about the fans. They've got some pent-up energy watching us play on the road, and all those nervous moments.\n\"Now we come home and they'll let that energy out in support of us, and that's going to be a lot of fun. In this place? I can't wait.\"\nThe atmosphere at Wrigley will be much different than it was at Busch Stadium for Games 1 and 2.\nThe Cardinals had cheerleaders on the field between innings hurling T-shirts into the stands with slingshots. The Cubs don't have cheerleaders in the park, unless Ronnie Woo-Woo snags a ticket.\nCardinals fans were treated to a bunch of horses tromping around the field before the games advertising a beer company. The only animals on the field at Wrigley this year were the penguins, flamingos and cheetahs Joe Maddon brought out before a couple of games a few weeks ago.\nJoe Maddon on breakfast spread, whether Cubs are 'America's Team' Joe Maddon on Sunday's breakfast spread at Wrigley Field and whether Cubs are \"America's Team.\"\nJoe Maddon on Sunday's breakfast spread at Wrigley Field and whether Cubs are \"America's Team.\"\nSee more videos And Busch Stadium's video board exhorted fans to \"get loud,\" while Wrigley Field's video boards tell no one how or when to cheer, thanks to an edict from Chairman Tom Ricketts when the boards were installed this year.\nYou're on your own, Cubs fans, so use your best judgment.\n\"It'll work to our advantage,\" Anthony Rizzo said. \"The fans here are unbelievable. I can't wait to see how loud it is. I want to see if we can get louder than it was in Pittsburgh, because that place was unbelievably loud.\"\nGeneral manager Jed Hoyer agreed, saying he was \"impressed with how loud it is at the right moments\" this year.\n\"They love this team and it's going to be really loud at Wrigley,\" Hoyer said. \"Our guys expect that and I'm sure they'll get it.\"\nThe build-up can work against the Cubs, too, as we saw in Game 1 of the 2008 NLDS against the Dodgers, when Wrigley was rocking until James Loney's fifth-inning grand slam off Ryan Dempster erased a 2-0 deficit. The crowd was muted the rest of the way in a 7-2 loss, and when the Dodgers scored five runs in the second inning of Game 2, a feeling of dread set in almost immediately.\nBut that's not a concern for Arrieta or this team, which has learned to ignore the ghosts of Wrigley. On the day before his first playoff game at Wrigley, rookie Kris Bryant reminisced about watching Cubs games on TV as a kid in Las Vegas, courtesy of the WGN superstation.\n\"Cubs games would always be on when I got home from elementary school,\" Bryant said. \"And they were always day games, too, so ... I grew up watching quite a bit of them.\"\nNow Bryant is here in the first of what he hopes are many Octobers to come.\n\"It really is a dream come true,\" he said. \"And I didn't expect my first year in the big leagues to have this type of whirlwind season.\"\nBefore 2015, the cheering started and ended in the stands. In the video board era, it can begin in the dugout and spread through the park, as happens with the rhythmic clapping during Starlin Castro's walk-up song, which now involves the entire ballpark.\nRizzo said the \"personality of our team is expanding to our fans,\" making for an interactive experience that's closer to a high school football stadium than a major-league ballpark.\nThis moment has been building since Wednesday's wild-card win in Pittsburgh, when Arrieta shut down the Pirates.\n\"The reaction (in Chicago) to the wild-card game was pretty insane, and that was just for a wild-card game,\" Rizzo said. \"Cubs-Cardinals?\"\nFor years we could only imagine.\nNow it's finally here.\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Jake Arrieta Wrigley Field David Ross Kris Bryant", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ab6cd/turbine/ct-joe-maddon-on-breakfast-spread-whether-cubs-are-america-s-team-20151011", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ab46e/turbine/ct-jake-arrieta-on-game-3-sunday-s-breakfast-spread-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561badc6/turbine/ct-sullivan-cubs-spt-1012-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:36:02.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
