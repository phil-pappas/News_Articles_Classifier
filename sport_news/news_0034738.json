It was a simple finish for Costa.The striker next wanted a penalty when charging through between Kieran Richardson and Lescott, but referee Roger East ignored his appeal.There was no reaction from a seated Mourinho, who is appealing against the B#50,000 fine and suspended one-match stadium ban meted out by the Football Association after he said referees were \"afraid\" to give Chelsea a penalty in the wake of the Southampton loss.Nemanja Matic was sent on at half-time for Loftus-Cheek and lasted longer than the 28 minutes he did as a half-time substitute against Southampton.Fabregas was pushed further forwards and played a diagonal pass to Costa, who ran at Richards and Hutton before a shot ricocheted in off the Scot.Costa might have had his second but mis-timed his leap to meet a Fabregas cross.A Grealish foul on Cesar Azpilicueta prompted a frank exchange between coaches Rui Faria and Mark Robson, while Costa was involved in minor altercations with Richards and Ashley Westwood as the clock wound down in a welcome routine home win.
