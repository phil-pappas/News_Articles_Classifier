(Photo: Angeli Wright/awright@citizen-times.com) \nWhat happens when you put the top passer and the top rusher in Western Highlands Conference football on the same field? \nTune in Thursday night and find out. \nKickoff between visiting Owen (1-7, 1-3) and Hendersonville (4-5, 3-1) is set for 7 p.m. from the Bearcats' Dietz Field. \nThe game will be televised live by WMYA (40), marking the third such instance for a Western North Carolina high school football game this season. \nSidney Gibbs (1,350 yards, 14 touchdowns) is only a sophomore, but averaging 168.8 rushing yards a game for the the Warhorses. Hendersonville senior Michael Schmidt (2,413 yards and 20 touchdowns with nine interceptions) leads all mountain quarterbacks in yards through the air. \nOf course, there will be 20 other players on the field Thursday night at any given moment. \nGibbs' quarterback is DeMarcus Harper (724 yards and six touchdowns with four interceptions). Bricen Fowler is the team's top receiver (18 receptions for 118 yards) and second-leading rusher (431 yards, one touchdown). Defensive standouts are Landon Hollar (5.8 tackles per game), Cyrus Hooper (5.5), Dexter Andrews (5.1) and Alex Huntsinger (4.4). \nSchmidt is the first 5,000-yard career passer in Bearcats history thanks in part to the hands of Tykel Landrum (44 receptions for 901 yards and seven touchdowns), Michael Cook (34 receptions for 552 yards and six touchdowns), Terrold Gary (26 receptions for 250 yards), Quintin Wright (25 receptions for 306 yards and two touchdowns) and Leon Cooks (21 receptions for 381 yards and five touchdowns). \nGary (799 yards, eight touchdowns) and Schmidt (609, eight touchdowns) pace Hendersonville in rushing. Blaine Sharpe (9.4 tackles per game), Landrum (7.3), Shawn Pearce (6.9) and Cole McMurray (6.1) are noteworthy defenders. \nBoth teams are coming off losses from last Friday â€” Owen fell, 15-14, at home to previously-winless Madison while the Bearcats were on the short end of a 56-40 shutout at undefeated Mitchell. \n- Follow the HS Huddle on Facebook: www.facebook.com/hshuddle or Twitter: www.twitter.com/acthshuddle Read or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1LOMSGN Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:48:34.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
