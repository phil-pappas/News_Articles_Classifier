(MyNews4.com & KRNV) -- We're just one day away from the battle for the Fremont Cannon.The UNLV Runnin' Rebels come into Mackay Stadium at 4 p.m. tomorrow.The recent history of this Nevada rivalry hasn't been particularly kind to one side of the field.Nine of the last ten Wolf Pack teams have routed their Rebel rivals, either taking or retaining the beloved Fremont Cannon.The one Las Vegas win came two seasons ago when the Rebels took down Nevada – it was the last time the game was played on Reno turf. The teams have met 40 times overall; and Nevada leads the all-time series 24 to 16.The winner, as always, holds onto the Fremont Cannon for the next year. We’re one community. We’re one Pack. When it’s Game Day in northern Nevada, we want everyone to know it! News 4, Fox 11, My 21 and News 10 in Elko are partnering with the Nevada Wolf Pack to raise Game Day awareness with our #Backthepack campaign. We’re challenging the entire community to show off their Pack Pride in two ways: Post videos and pictures to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram—and other social media outlets—using hashtag #backthepack to show off your Pack Pride; show us your killer tailgating traditions, Game Day rituals, kiddos decked out in Wolf Pack gear… the sky’s the limit! Snap a photo of a local business that is going above and beyond in showing their Pack Pride with a cool display or event; that business could get a visit from our #backthepack street team and be featured on the news! Thanks for standing with the Pack and being part of the movement. Get started by connecting with us on Facebook or search Instagram and Twitter using hashtag #backthepack . Go Pack!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:37:59.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
