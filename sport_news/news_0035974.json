The outcome enabled Baker (2-2 in the league) to leapfrog the 1-2-1 Pioneers for second place. Only two days earlier, the Bulldogs had beaten last-place Ontario. “It was a big upset,” Mac-Hi coach Martin Martinez said. “Our girls went in overconfident, thinking we always beat Baker. They weren’t ready. Baker came in fired up. “When you’re not ready and overconfident, you’re going to make mistakes that the other team’s going to capitalize on.” Mac-Hi’s Harmonie Correa scored both goals on penalty kicks, the latter at the 72nd minute to pull within one of Baker, as the Bulldog defense refused to give the Pioneers many opportunities. “(Baker) did a great job of keeping us out of their goal area,” Martinez said. “As soon as we’d get a chance, they’d boot the ball out their area. They didn’t do a whole lot other than that.” The Pioneers (6-2-3 overall) next travel to Baker for a rematch Thursday. Pioneer boys steamroll Baker, 10-0 MILTON-FREEWATER — McLoughlin High School boys’ soccer coach Jose Garcia challenged his Pioneers before their match Thursday against Baker, and they responded as Mac-Hi gained a 10-0 win in the Greater Oregon League. “It’s hard to get them to work together, but it happened,” Garcia said. “I told them, ‘If you’re not performing well, you’re going to sit and watch because I have other guys who want to play. I think they got the message.” Mac-Hi improved its records to 4-5-1 overall and 1-3 in the league. The Pioneers next play Tuesday at Baker in a rematch.
