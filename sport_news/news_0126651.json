Tom Brady singled out a few of the biggest brands in the food and beverage industry in some critical comments made during a recent radio interview and his claims did not go unchallenged by those companies he targeted.\nAdChoices Both Coca-Cola and Kellogg’s issued statements defending their products after the New England Patriots quarterback denounced the products as “poison” and one of the causes of “incredible rates of disease in our country,” respectively.\nBrady was making comments in defense of his personal trainer Alex Guerrero during an interview on WEEI radio Tuesday, primarily in response to a damning report filed by Boston Magazine about him over the weekend.\n“You’ll probably go out and drink Coca-Cola and think, ‘Oh yeah, that’s no problem.’ Why? Because they pay lots of money for advertisements to think that you should drink Coca-Cola for a living? No, I totally disagree with that,” Brady said, via Eye on Football. “And when people do that, I think that’s quackery. And the fact that they can sell that to kids? I mean, that’s poison for kids.”\nCoca-Cola fired back in a statement provided to FOX Business , which read in part: “All of our beverages are safe and can be enjoyed as part of a balanced lifestyle.”\nKellogg, meanwhile, had one of its breakfast cereal products, Frosted Flakes, criticized by Brady.\n“You keep eating those things and you keep wondering why we do have just incredible rates of disease in our country,” he said.\nThe company responded to the quarterback’s comments with its own statement to FOX Business via a spokesperson.\n“Cereal is a delicious and nutritious breakfast,” the spokesperson said. “… As a matter of fact, a serving of Frosted Flakes with skim milk has just 150 calories and delivers valuable nutrients including calcium, B vitamins and iron.”\nHowever everything plays out going forward, this much is a certainty: Don’t t expect Brady to follow in the footsteps of teammate Rob Gronkowski and authorize the production of “Brady Flakes” anytime soon.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2015/10/13/tom-brady-calls-coca-cola-poison-takes-swipe-at-frosted-flakes/", "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25338809/coca-cola-on-tom-bradys-poison-remark-all-our-drinks-are-safe", "http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2012/09/21/theyre-grrrrronk-rob-gronkowski-has-his-very-own-breakfast-cereal-photo/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2015/10/09/tom-brady-alex-guerrero-neurosafe"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:43:18.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
