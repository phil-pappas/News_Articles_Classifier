Matthew Emmons / USA TODAY Sports Oct 26, 2015 at 1:20p ET 0Shares \nNow that he has a two-game winning streak, a quarterback to build on and finally a little excitement from the fan base and Texas coach Charlie Strong would consider coaching at Miami? \nDuring his Monday press conference, Strong laughed off a report that he \"would listen\" if contacted by the Hurricanes, who are looking for a replacement for the fired Al Golden. \nStrong dismissed the report from ESPN college football writer Brett McMurphy and said he has the \"best\" job in the country. true Texas coach Charlie Strong was asked if he was going to Miami. He started laughing and said he has the best job in the country — Anwar Richardson (@AnwarRichardson) October 26, 2015 Strong said, \"They're either ripping me or saying I lost my team.\" He's laughing about Miami rumors. — Kirk Bohls (@kbohls) October 26, 2015 Strong posed, \"Am I the topic on there (ESPN) every week?\" Pretty much. — Kirk Bohls (@kbohls) October 26, 2015 \nThings have not gone smoothly for Strong in his first year-and-a-half on the job at Texas as he tries to push forward a program that was already in decline during Mack Brown's final seasons. \nMcMurphy suggested several factors could lure Strong to Miami, including his frustrations with now working under two school presidents and two athletic directors (current AD Mike Perrin serves on an interim basis), his recruiting ties to South Florida from his days as defensive coordinator at Florida and his wife's ties to the state, she is from Lakeland. \nTexas has won two in a row for the first time this season to improve to 3-4 overall and 2-2 in the conference. After some trying times after a blowout opening loss at Notre Dame and the TCU fiasco, Strong's Longhorns upset then-No. 10 Oklahoma and beat Kansas State last week. \nOverall he is 9-11 at Texas.
