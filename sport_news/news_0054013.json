No distress signal was received.\nWeekend search efforts were hindered by bad weather and rough terrain, Soelistyo said. Rescuers have checked locations reportedly by the locals, but they were found nothing.\nYesterday, two aircraft and two helicopters combed areas around the location where the missing plane was believed to have made the last contact and areas where villagers allegedly heard or spotted the plane before it went missing, said Ivan Ahmad Titus, the agency's operation director.\nSoelistyo said the plane may not have been equipped with an emergency locator transmitter, a device attached to the so-called black boxes, which emits a signal indicating its position.\nDirector General of Air Transportation Suprasetyo said officials were investigating that possibility.\nThe 1981 Canadian-made plane joined Aviastar in January 2014 and underwent its most recent maintenance on September 15.\nIndonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of about 250 million people, has been plagued by transportation accidents in recent years, including plane and train crashes and ferry sinkings. It is one of Asia's most rapidly expanding airline markets, but is struggling to obtain qualified pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and modern airport technology.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:39:40.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
