(AP) Honda is recalling 143,000 Civic and Fit vehicles in the U.S. to fix a software problem that could cause the front wheels to lock up.\nThe recall announced Thursday is for the 2014 and 2015 model years for the Honda Civic and the 2015 model for the Fit.\nThe software that will be repaired for free manages continuously variable transmission. Honda says the software was programmed in a way that exposes the vehicles' drive pulley shaft to more stress than it was built to handle.\nThe car maker says no crashes or injuries have been linked to the software issue yet.\nRecall notices are expected to be sent to affected customers in mid-October. More information can be obtained on Honda's website or calling 888-234-2138.\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
