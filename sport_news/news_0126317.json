Under NFL rules, Williams can return to practice in six weeks, and be eligible to play two weeks later. \nWilliams missed two games after hurting his neck in a 40-32 loss to New England on Sept. 20. He briefly lost feeling in the left side of his body and was driven off the field by ambulance and taken to the hospital. \nWilliams returned last weekend, but missed a few snaps after appearing to aggravate the injury in a 14-31 win at Tennessee. \nBuffalo (3-2) hosts Cincinnati (5-0) on Sunday. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:10:03.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
