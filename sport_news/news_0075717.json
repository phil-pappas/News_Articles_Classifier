But, as they have at various points this season, the Devils battled back to make it interesting. \nLee Stempniak came close to scoring a shorthanded goal with 7:54 left in the third. Henrik Lundqvist had to make a quick pad save to keep the game tied. \nSergey Kalinin has shown some promise. Needs to start producing. \nLOWLIGHTS \nThe Devils' power play (0-for-3), which had been tied for fifth in the league entering the game.
