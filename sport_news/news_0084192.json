The Vatican has confirmed the visit but refused to elaborate on it.\nGreg Hillis, an associate professor of theology at Bellarmine University, said that if the Vatican had wanted to take sides “it would not have been hush-hush about the visit.”\n“The important thing we should take away is that the pope practiced what he preaches,\" Hillis said in an interview. \"He consistently emphasizes the importance of meeting with all people. He is not going to dismiss people or hate people based on their ideology.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nLetters on Kim Davis and the Pope\nMirroring those views, in an essay published in The Washington Post under the headline, “Relax, Pope Francis’s meeting with Kim Davis isn’t such a big deal,” the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author, said the pope meets with many people, but that doesn’t mean he endorses everything they do.\n“Not to put too fine a point on it,\" Martin said, \"but Pope Francis also met Mark Wahlberg, and that does not mean that he liked ‘Ted,’ ’’ the Seth McFarlane movie about a man whose childhood wishes bring his teddy bear friend to life.\nSome analysts also have argued that the meeting was less about same-sex marriage and more about Francis’ support for conscientious objection.\nBut to Greg Bourke, one of the petitioners who won the historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June guaranteeing same-sex couples the right to marry, the pope’s session with Davis was extremely disappointing and disturbing.\n“We thought he was our friend, our ally,” Bourke said in an interview. He noted that two years ago, asked by reporters what he thought of gay priests, Francis responded, “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?”\nThe Rev. Albert Mohler, the president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, also was upset with the pontiff, for what Mohler said was speaking out of both sides of his mouth on moral issues, infuriating people on both sides.\nIn a long discussion on his daily podcast, “The Briefing,” Mohler condemned the pope for meeting with Davis but trying to keep it secret, which Mohler described as a “very unbrave act.”\n“You can’t describe this as courageous in any sense whatsoever,” Mohler said.\nAbout the only person who didn’t have a comment on the pope’s encounter with Davis was the archbishop of Louisville, the Rev. Joseph Kurtz, who as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has taken a hard line against gay marriage.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nKim Davis should do her job, most in poll say\nCecelia Price, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said that because the meeting was arranged by the Holy See and because the Holy See press office has declined further comment, Kurtz wouldn’t be commenting either.\nFrancis’ meeting with Davis was first reported by Inside the Vatican, which is edited and published by an American journalist.\nDavis told ABC News on Wednesday that “I hugged him and he hugged me, and he said, ‘Thank you for your courage.’\n“I had tears coming out of my eyes,” she said. “I’m just a nobody,” Davis said, “so it was really humbling to think he would want to meet or know me.”\nDavis served five days in jail after she refused to comply with a federal judge’s order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, which she said she couldn’t do because her name would appear on them, in violation of her religious principles.\nShe was released after she promised to let her deputy clerks issue them.\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\nBeshear: Kim Davis’s legal arguments 'absurd'\nSome critics, including Bourke, said they were surprised the pope would meet with her because she has been divorced three times.\nHer lawyer, Mat Staver, chairman and founder of Liberty Counsel, has noted she underwent a religious conversion four years ago and that her previous life is irrelevant because “it wiped the slate clean.”\nReporter Andrew Wolfson can be reached at (502) 582-7189 or at awolfson@courier-journal.com\nPope Francis waited until his historic U.S. visit was over to make his most direct comments on the nation's debate over gay marriage, saying government officials should have the right to refrain from", "external_links": ["http://pthumbnails.5min.com/10382288/519114365_3_embedStandard.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12ab58a71d3915ae8d8d36c748a7b7e4976a105a/r=540&c=540x304/http/pthumbnails.5min.com/10382288/519114365_3_embedStandard.jpg", "http://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/2015/10/01/beshear-kim-daviss-legal-arguments-absurd/73135720/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a9ed94caa6f6d8fe911a7d75244a2f00a08b5794/c=849-0-4248-3399/local/-/media/2015/09/14/Louisville/Louisville/635778326777542441-150914RowanClerk-TW635.jpg", "http://cjky.it/1FCyl09"], "published": "2015-10-02T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:50:12.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
