He quickly became one of the guiding forces behind the Red Raiders’ improbable run to the Division 3 championship game at Gillette Stadium.\n“The seniors really helped me a great deal,” Pedrini said. “It was a great experience playing with them. They were great leaders and I was glad they were able to get a chance to play at Gillette.”\nYou spend time with Pedrini and it is clear that the 5-foot-10, 185-pounder is more comfortable talking about the team then himself. Morris says it is one of the qualities which makes Pedrini one of the most popular athletes in the school.\n“Mike is a great, great kid,” Morris said. “He’s an outstanding student, has a great work ethic, is consistently in the weight room and always has a smile on his face. He’s definitely the type of kid we want around here.”\nWith Pedrini around as the lead back this year, Melrose has jumped out to a 4-0 start and leads the Middlesex Freedom. With the veteran group of Jack Hickey, Jake Karelas and Co. gone, Pedrini has seen his role evolve in more ways than one.\n“Even though I am playing the same position, my role on the field is growing,” Pedrini said. “I have more responsibilities this year. I’m a year older and I am more confident.”\nThat confidence shined brightly in last week’s 28-7 over Watertown in a battle of undefeated teams. Pedrini rushed for 166 yards and all four Melrose touchdowns. While the win puts the Red Raiders in the driver’s seat, Pedrini refuses to look too far toward December and a possible second Super Bowl appearance.\n“We definitely think about getting back there again,” he said. “But we can’t focus on that. All can we worry about now is Wilmington this week and try to get a good seed in the playoffs.”\nDo you have a similar story in your community?
