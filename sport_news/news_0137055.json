And lest anybody forget it, just remember that the Rangers last winter added Yovani Gallardo to further reinforce a rotation that looked like an asset only to lose Yu Darvish and Derek Holland before the end of the first week of the season.\nThe Rangers go into the winter with an ace on hand in Cole Hamels and with another (Darvish) expected back by May. They expect continued improvement from Martin Perez as he goes into his second season post-Tommy John surgery. They still have no idea what to expect from Derek Holland, who can be awesome one game and awful the next. Chi Chi Gonzalez should be ready to assume a starter's spot full-time.\nIn a best-case scenario, that's a five-man pool. Seven if you want to go so far as to add Nick Martinez and Anthony Ranaudo. Consider this: Every AL team used at least eight starters in 2015.\nThe guys who might have added depth - Jake Thompson, Alec Asher and Jerad Eickhoff - were all dealt to Philadelphia in the Cole Hamels/Jake Diekman deal.\nThere are no guarantees on Colby Lewis, who led the staff in innings in 2015, or Yovani Gallardo, who ranked second. Both are free agents. The Rangers can't count on either to forego the best possible market prices to re-sign with Texas. That simply doesn't happen.\n\"I remember reading a Quote: a couple of years ago, 'I you don't have enough pitching in April you're almost definitely not going to have it in September','' Daniels said. \"That's the case. So I would expect this winter, between Colby and Yovani and/or somebody outside the organization that we will look to add some stability to the rotation.\"\nIt does not mean the Rangers will jump in on Zack Greinke. They already have their share of $100 million commitments and Greinke is liable to command about 2.5 times that much. They will search for value, whether it's on the trade market, as they did with Gallardo last year, or in free agency.\nThe Rangers did try to gauge Oakland's interest last summer in dealing Sonny Gray and that might be a place for them to start again this year. Gray would cost a ton in player inventory, but his salary will be quite affordable for at least three years. On the free agent market, look for the Rangers to dabble more in the buy-low market on a guy like sinkerballer Doug Fister, who is coming off an awful year in Washington.\nRangers eliminated from postseason\nRangers loss reviewed Rangers offseason issue No. 2: Improving team balance could cost this key contributor\nRangers could have another major pitching free agent to deal with\nRangers offseason issue No. 1: Is there enough starting pitching?
