Cokley has made the biggest gain, going from 215 to 240 pounds, head coach Jerod Haase said. Mehinti is from 225 last year to between 235 and 240. Lee is only at 207, but Haase remarked that his body has physically changed. \n\"All three of those guys in the weight room, have done an unbelievable job in changing their bodies,\" Haase said. \"I think our front line is lean and athletic, but I think this year, there is at least some element of bulk to them.\" \nLee and Mehinti were starters last year, while Cokley provided valuable minutes and contributions off the bench. Lee said earlier this month that coaches wanted him to be in the 215-pound range, but he came up just short. \n\"I'm not a big guy on a specific number,\" Haase said. \"At the end of the day, I want them to be the best basketball players they can be. Whether it's 210 or 207, it won't make the biggest difference in the world.\" \nSophomore point guard Nick Norton is also noticeably bigger, playing this year at 170 pounds while last year he weighed in at 155. \nSome other notes as UAB finishes its second week of preseason practice \nOn UAB returning all five starters and the competition for minutes : \"We certainly haven't named starters for the year or anything,\" Haase said. \"I think some guys are going to be hard to be hard to beat out. At the same time, the guys behind him, it may be a situation where we have seven or eight guys who deserve to start and we treat like starters with starter-type minutes.\" \nOn Lewis Sullivan, the sophomore forward who could step into a bigger role, and newcomers Dirk Williams and Thomas Smallwood: \"They're all doing great. There's going to be a chance for all of them to play right away. Lewis will play more in the frontcourt this year and I think he's pretty skilled for a four-man. Thomas, he shoots the ball so well and he's a legit 7-feet. Dirk really has a chance. His ability to shoot the basketball and athleticism, he's a guy who really fits what we're trying to do in our scheme.\" \nOn the 6-foot-5 junior college transfer Williams' defensive abilities: \"I told him, 'You have a chance to be a special defender, 'because he has the unique ability to move really well and his arms are so long, his reach is so long, he can affect shots with his length. He has a chance to be a high-level defender.\" \nOn veterans Denzell Watts and Tyler Madison, who bring versatility off the bench. Watts can play the 1 or 2 positions, while Madison can play the 2, 3 or 4: \"They're doing great. The one thing we've emphasized with everybody on the team is the only thing that matters is how well the team does. As the team does well, everybody individually will kind of have success. Their flexibility is huge and they do a lot of things in the toughness elements that we need.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:30:07.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
