Years later, a high school friend's son died from the disease. Those losses inspired Bonnell to apply for and secure one of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's five Kona slots.\nBonnell, 44, has diligently trained to ensure a respectable finish. In the process, he also surpassed his original fundraising goal of $75,000. He's now attempting to raise $100,000 in research funds to eradicate the deadly disease. bid\nBonnell never imagined racing at Kona. He's competitive and enjoys collecting hardware at area sprint and Olympic distance races. But the full Ironman distance wasn't really his thing. He never imagined attempting another full Ironman after his 2013 Ironman Lake Tahoe experience. He was among the 1700 who finished the grueling and cold race out of the 2,800 who started.\nHe said at the time that he would never do another full Ironman unless he got into Kona. He thought he'd never do kona because \"I know I'm not good enough.\"\nHe proved he was among the best potential ambassadors in the eyes of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, who awarded him one of its five slots to Kona. He met the group's Team in Training race criteria: He would likely finish the race, had a connection to the cause, committed to raise significant dollars and would be, in their eyes, a good ambassador.\n\"It's unbelievable that I will get to go along with the greatest athletes in the world,\" Bonnell said earlier this fall. \"I won't be the one fighting for the front row spots. I'll have the entire day to finish.\"\nBonnell, the executive chef of three Fort Worth restaurants and the chef for TCU's stadium, took up triathlon seven years ago. He said one day he realized he didn't want to an overweight, out of shape guy. He started working out at a gym, building up his cardio on the treadmill. A trainer encouraged him to do the local Turkey Trot 5K.\nOver time, he dropped 45 pounds and \"caught the competitive bug,\" he said. He set a goal to earn a piece of hardware at a road race by placing in his age group.\n\"My personality is such that if I put a race on the calendar, I will work on it,\" he said.\nHe extended his distance to the half marathon. Then, he tried a sprint triathlon and found his passion. He said the sprint distance remains his favorite.\nOn Saturday, he'll be racing in memory and in honor of two people: David Publicover and Jack Duffy.\nBonnell and Publicover were buddies back at Fort Worth Country Day School. Bonnell remembers Publicover being one of the fastest and biggest kids in grade school until he was diagnosed with leukemia. Then, Publicover had to miss lots of school each year undergoing cancer treatments. Bonnell remembered him being one of the positive and courageous people he ever knee.\n\"He passed away during our junior year, but it happened over spring break, long before the time we had cell phones or social media,\" Bonnell wrote on his fundraising page . \"Most of us were on various trips with our families and didn't hear the news until we returned the following week, too late to pay our final respects.\n\"After all these years, it will be my distinct honor to run for David.\"\nBonnell also will running in memory of the son of his friend, Brad Duffy. They became friends in the '80s at Arlington Heights High School. Duffy's son, Jack, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at seven months. He battled for a couple years. He died on Nov. 17, 2004.\n\"In 1960, the survival rate of a child diagnosed was in the 14% range for five years,\" Bonnell reports on his fundrasing page. \"Today, its closer to 60% because of cutting-edge medical research and funding just like this. There is still vital work to be done.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @DFWRunning", "external_links": ["http://pages.teamintraining.org/ntx/ironworl15/jbonnell", "https://twitter.com/DFWRunning"], "published": "2015-10-09T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:45:56.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
