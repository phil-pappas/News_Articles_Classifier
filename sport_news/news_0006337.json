Senior cornerback Josh Hawkins read the quarterback and stepped in front the pass. He raced down the sidelines, end zone-to-end zone, on Tulsa’s initial possession – 100 yards for an East Carolina touchdown. That pick-6 sparked the Pirates who went on to prevail 30-17 at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium on Saturday. “That one definitely ranks up there. That was my first pick-6 in my college career, so I am really humbled and blessed to have that situation,” Hawkins said. “I read the quarterback well, he threw it and I made a play on it. I am glad my guys were there to help me make that pick-6.” Tulsa, which started its drive at its own 19-yard line, moved the ball to within the Pirates’ red zone. Dane Evans was looking for his receiver, but Hawkins leapt in front of the throw to stop Tulsa’s scoring opportunity and give the Pirates the momentum. “They did some crossing routes and they tried to throw the Wheel Route, and I was sitting right there on it,” Hawkins said. “I was a running back in high school and I just clicked into a running back real quick.” The Pirates have six interception returns for touchdown against Tulsa since 2008. The previous occurred last season when Brandon Williams took an interception 37 yards back to the house. DaShaun Amos scored on a 100-yard interception return in a Pirates’ 58-24 win over the Golden Hurricane in 2013. Emanuel Davis and Levin Neal each returned an interception for a score in 2009, and Travis Simmons had a 72-yard pick-6 in the 2008 Conference USA Championship Game in Tulsa. “I was on the opposite side of the field, so it was nice to see somebody else do it. I don’t know what it is about Tulsa, but we always seem to get a pick-6,” Amos said. “It caught me off guard. Once (Hawkins) got it, I was excited for him. I sprinted over there and celebrated with him.” Amos and Hawkins, teammates, share the same record-setting feat. “We talked about it and (Amos) said, ‘man, you are going to be in the record books,’” Hawkins said. “I don’t even think about that. I just try to help the team out and do the best I can to be a factor and an aspect on the team.” Hawkins, a 5-foot-10 native of Winston-Salem, has two interceptions, four pass breakups and 31 tackles this season. Evans threw just his fourth interception in six games. Page 2 of 2 - Hawkins has nine career picks and he led the Pirates with five last season. “I’m not going to stop at this one. Last year I had five interceptions and I definitely want more,” Hawkins said. “I have to keep going through my techniques and follow what the coaching staff says.” East Carolina’s defense forced two turnovers, had four sacks and limited a Tulsa offense that entered the game averaging 36 points and 568 yards per game to 17 points and 463 yards. “We always talk about being a team and playing together,” Amos said. “When one side is slow, we make sure the other attacks. We were just doing our job and helping the team out.” Adam Thompson is the sports editor at the Sun Journal. He can be contacted at 252-635-5669.
