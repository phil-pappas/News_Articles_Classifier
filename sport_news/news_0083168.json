It’s not hard to figure out the most surprising team in the early going of the 2015 MLB Playoffs: the Texas Rangers. At the same time, you won’t have to look much further to find the postseason’s biggest disappointment.\nAdChoices By dropping two straight at a subdued Rogers Centre, the Toronto Blue Jays are in the most precarious of situations. The team that was the hottest since the beginning of August is now one defeat away from flaming out in October.\nThis top-ranked offense, which led the MLB in scoring by a wide margin, was unable to put across a single run during the final nine frames of the 14-inning Game 2 marathon. Although soon-to-be AL MVP Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista have each gone deep, those homers were each solo shots. Toronto, for the most part, has failed to sustain consistency in the lineup. Troy Tulowitzski is without a hit in 10 at-bats. He and Edwin Encarnacion (the No. 4 and 5 hitters in the lineup) combined to go 0-for-11 on Friday.\nThose who were so stellar during the stretch run and led them to the American League East title are struggling at the worst possible time. That includes David Price, whom the Jays picked up at the trade deadline to bolster the rotation. But if the team was relying on him to come through in the playoffs, it was a risky endeavor. With his loss in Game 1, the lefty is now 1-6 in postseason play (no wins as a starter) with a 4.79 earned run average in 47 innings.\nWhile Price and company are faltering, the Rangers are exceeding expectations.\nAggressiveness on the base paths, led by Rougned Odor, has paid off in the form of key scoring plays. And even with their best September hitter, Adrian Beltre, out with lower back pain, the Rangers' offense has produced both early and late.\nThe bullpen definitely deserves its share of credit in the Blue Jays’ power outage. It tossed seven scoreless innings in Game 2, allowing just two hits and striking out nine. The day before, Ranger relievers relinquished only a single run and two hits (without giving up a walk) over the final four innings.\nTexas’ play is making it plenty difficult for the Jays to succeed. But, if you ask some of the Toronto players, they may feel otherwise .\nJose Bautista critical of replay, while Jays question strike zone after Game 2 http://t.co/FgUJ9iB9Ee\n— Gordon Edes (@GordonEdes) October 10, 2015 Whatever has caused the Jays to fall behind 0-2, they need to overcome it starting in Arlington on Sunday. But taking everything into consideration, the Blue Jays are by no means finished.\nWith a microwave-like offense, Toronto can get hot — and stay that way for a while. Don’t let the events of the past two days make you forget the entire regular season — especially those two 11-game winning streaks, including one in which the Jays plated 88 runs.\nIn a quick series, a prolonged slump by key members could result in an early exit. It happened to the Los Angeles Angels last year. It could very well happen to the Blue Jays. But this team is wielding the necessary tools — including Game 3 starter Marco Estrada — to dig itself out of a hole.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://t.co/FgUJ9iB9Ee", "https://twitter.com/GordonEdes/status/652673719454855168?ref_src=twsrc^tfw", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/GordonEdes/status/652673719454855168"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:54:19.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
