But they can’t take away what these guys accomplished all year long. You can’t take that away from them no matter if we lose [Thursday] night or we come out on top.”\nThe manager’s comment was in response to a question about what it felt like to have the season boil down to a win-or-lose game.\n“I’ve looked at it this way: Obviously, this is where you want to get,” Collins said. “You want to get to postseason. Any time you’re down to win-or-lose, it’s a tough situation. There’s a lot of pressure on both teams. But I’m so proud of the way our guys made it through the season.”\nCollins has the perspective of a manager whose franchise went nine years between postseason appearances. Dodgers manager Don Mattingly, who could be on the hot seat if his team loses Thursday, probably would view Game 5 as something more substantial than “gravy.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under don mattingly ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  terry collins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:31:50.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
