SULLIVAN/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIt’s the season of the spotlight for Rutgers’ football assistant coaches. \nRunning backs coach Norries Wilson, who is acting as interim head coach with Kyle Flood suspended for three games , hasn’t been shy about hyping up some of his peers with his newly granted media platform. \nFirst came praise for wide receivers coach Anthony Campanile after Saturday’s win against Kansas, during which Carlton Agudosi scored his first career touchdown and Andre Patton had a team-high five catches. \n“Coach Campanile is the best coach on the staff,” Wilson said. “I wish I could coach as good as he does, and he's on his guys and he demands from them. He was demanding from them at breakfast (Saturday) morning, still teaching.” \nCampanile, a former Rutgers player, is in his fourth season at his alma mater, after previously coaching at Don Bosco High School. \n“Sometimes kids fall into ‘Hey, I’ve arrived,’ and I know Coach Campanile is not going to allow that,” Wilson said. “He's going to make sure that he's coaching them through the bye week and just continue to get better.” \nThen came Wilson’s awe of the hours logged by special teams coordinator and tight ends coach Phil Galiano, who is back on the field after spending last season as Rutgers’ recruiting coordinator. \n“Coach Galiano does a great job with that group,” Wilson said. “I just couldn’t fathom having all special teams and having a position group. You might as well just move into your office. He finds a way to get it done.” \nFlood still is running the program six days a week but is prohibited from contacting anyone in the program on game days. He also can’t speak with the media during his suspension. \nIn his absence, Wilson appears to be delegating a lot of decision-making in the heat of the moment to individual position coaches. That group also faces the challenge of keeping together a consensus top-40 recruiting class in the face of turmoil. \nBefore he was suspended, when asked for his contingency plan if he had to miss a game for any reason, Flood said, “I’ve got a very talented coaching staff.” \nAssistant coaches are permitted to speak to the media only one day per year — on preseason media day — under Rutgers policy. \nThe full-time coaching staff also includes offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels, defensive coordinator Joe Rossi, offensive line coach Mitch Browning, defensive line coach Jim Panagos, linebackers coach Bob Fraser and defensive backs coach Darrell Wilson. \nSean Barowski, Rocco DiMeco, Andrew Lieberman and Scott Vallone are the graduate assistants. \nAll-Big Ten defensive tackle Darius Hamilton, who is out for the season but is expected to return next year as a redshirt senior, recently described Panagos as “the only guy I want to play for, one of the best defensive line coaches you'll find in the country.” \nOf the interim head coach, Hamilton, a co-captain, said: “He’s a great guy. He looks at the bigger picture of things as well as football.” \nBut how much do the various position coaches communicate with each other? \n“We deal with each other. We have to work together,” Norries Wilson said. \n“Coach Rossi and Coach (Darrell) Wilson will get together with Coach Campanile and Coach McDaniels, and they will do one-on-one (drills) with each other. They have to plan those things out — how the drills are going to go. \n“Coach Panagos and Coach Browning get together and have competitive drills during individual periods. You have to talk those things out so you are getting in the most work in the little time that you are given.” Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1KI7VZI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:32:35.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
