The VCU Rams will head into the 2015-2016 season without the man that put them on the map—Shaka Smart. Smart, in the biggest news to break after the NCAA tournament, announced he would be leaving Virginia Commonwealth University to become the head coach of the University of Texas.\nAdChoices Many remember VCU most for its incredible run in the 2011 NCAA tournament, where the Rams, recipients of an at-large bid, advanced all the way from the play-in game for the 11th seed to the Final Four, where they ultimately lost to Butler. What may not be so apparent at first glance is how consistently impressive Smart’s VCU teams have been—they made the NCAA tournament five straight times and posted at least 26 wins every year under Smart (2009-2015).\nWhat should you expect from the Rams this upcoming season? Don’t anticipate much of a lapse in the quality on the floor as new head coach Will Wade takes over. This is unquestionably the city of Richmond’s team (sorry Spider’s), and while it may take some time for Wade to be the face of the city, as Smart was, expect similar results from the new coach.\nWade turned Chattanooga’s basketball program around in his two seasons as head coach with a combined 40-25 record and finished second in the Southern Conference both seasons. This flipped the script from the two seasons before Wade became the head coach when the Mocs went 24-40. Last season, Chattanooga had the second best scoring offense as well as the second best scoring margin in the Southern Conference. Wade’s coaching ability is evident and will further prove itself this season with VCU.\nIf ever there was a guard designed in the image of a Shaka Smart-style “havoc” defense, it was last year’s Briante Weber. In just eight games of conference play, Weber amassed 31 steals, which averages out to 3.8 steals per game. Weber’s season-ending injury could have spelled disaster for a team predicated on a turnover-forcing defense, but the Rams’ other guards stepped up in a big way down the stretch.\nIn Weber’s absence, Doug Brooks and JeQuan Lewis racked up 25 (1.7 stpg) and 23 (1.6 stpg) steals, respectively. Wade, an assistant coach under Smart from 2009-2013, is well-versed in the high-intensity style of play that became the trademark of VCU basketball. Wade had his own brand of defense as head coach at Chattanooga called “chaos.” Whether there’s havoc or chaos in Richmond, Brooks and Lewis will be the guards opposing teams can’t swat away.\nWade has plenty of other talent returning. Three of the Rams’ leading scorers return from last season—Melvin Johnson, JeQuan Lewis and Mo Alie-Cox. Johnson will bring the three-point shooting ability to spread defenses out. Tied for sixth in the conference for three-pointers made, Johnson will be the threat to propel the Rams to the top three of the A-10 in scoring.\nKeeping Johnson honest coupled with big Mo Alie-Cox inside will be a tough challenge. With the A-10 nearly void of true centers, Alie-Cox, 6’ 7” and 250 lbs, can dominate the paint. Don’t think the stat line for Mo Alie-Cox will stop impressing after points—in this undersized league he will get more than his fair share of boards on both ends of the court, as well as continue to protect the rim after ranking fourth in the conference for blocked shots.\nWade’s mark will be most obvious in VCU’s rebounding. Last season the Rams ranked last in defensive rebounding and had the second worst rebounding margin in the A-10. The Mocs, however, boasted the second best rebounding margin in the Southern Conference. While Mo Alie-Cox was impressive on the offensive glass, Wade will certainly look to bring his, and the team's, defensive rebounding up to snuff. Another area Wade will look to improve is VCU’s three-point defense—in the A-10 stifling behind-the-arc threats cannot be emphasized enough.\nLike Smart, Wade brings youthful energy to the sidelines and is a players' coach. VCU quickly found the right man to bring to Richmond—Wade knows the system, has proved himself in the SoCon and will improve an already talented core. The Rams heading to their sixth straight NCAA tournament berth should surprise no one.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:13:52.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
