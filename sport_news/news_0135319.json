Ohio State has more talent than MSU. Ohio State is the defending national champion. The Buckeyes have a ton of players back from that team and have won 18 straight games. \nRight now, MSU’s offensive line is banged up and its defense is nowhere near what was expected. This week, MSU improved its pass defense, and now, the run defense is leaky. \nI’m also putting Utah above MSU, and I admit that’s a week late. MSU hung on to beat Oregon at home. Utah crushed Oregon on the road. And then MSU barely got past Purdue. Meanwhile, every day, Utah’s victory over Michigan looks more impressive for the Utes. \nTCU is my new No.2 ranked team, after four straight games of putting up 50 or more points. \nBaylor moves up because the Bears are doing something that MSU has not been able to do: The Bears are crushing the teams they should crush. Baylor’s average victory margin is somewhere near ridiculous. \nClemson moves up after a two-point win over Notre Dame. The guess here is that Clemson will beat Florida State at home on Nov.7 and be one of the last four teams standing. \nAnd I’m keeping Ole Miss in my top 25, based on its victory over Alabama. I know you could make an argument that Ole Miss should be ranked ahead of Alabama – based on head to head matchup – but not after the way Ole Miss played on Saturday and Alabama bounced back. \nAlso, Iowa, which is off to its best start since 2009, cracks my top 25 with a 10-6 victory over No.19 Wisconsin. \nThat gives the Big 10 five teams in my top 25. \nJeff Seidel’s top 25 \n1.
