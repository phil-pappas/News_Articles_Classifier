It's a long season, there are a lot of competitions and everyone will be important.\" \nNuno selected three forwards for Tuesday's game, Spain international Paco Alcacer, Rodrigo and Santi Mina. \nGoals have been scarce for Valencia this term and they have scored only seven in eight La Liga games, eight fewer than at the same stage last season. \nThe Singapore-owned club are back in Europe's elite club competition after a two-year absence and are second in Group H after a 3-2 defeat at home to Zenit St Petersburg and a 1-0 triumph at Olympique Lyonnais. \n\"I have confidence in all the players in the squad and I try to give my best as a coach to get the best out of each of them,\" said Nuno. \n(Writing by Iain Rogers , editing by Tony Jimenez) \nOur top photos from the past 24 hours.
