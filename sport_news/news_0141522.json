She was forced to withdraw from the tournament, as well as subsequent tournaments in Tokyo and Wuhan.\nThe Canadian was trailing 6-2, 1-1 against Petkovic on Monday when she decided to call it quits.\n“I just asked her what happened, and she told me that she felt very dizzy,” Petkovic said after the match. “Then I asked if it was the same, if it still was the concussion. She said, ‘Yeah, it tends to come back when she gets physically very active.'”\nIt’s been a difficult year for the Canadian following her breakout season in 2014 when she reached the Wimbledon final and the semis at the Australian and French Open. Her record in 2015, meanwhile, is just 12-17 and her ranking has fallen all the way from No. 5 to No. 38.\nPetkovic wishing Bouchard her condolences after the latter retires with further concussion symptoms. #class pic.twitter.com/ZfegolYd9d \n— Jeff Donaldson (@jddtennis) October 5, 2015 \n\nBouchard’s retirement came on the heels of four other withdrawals in the women’s draw on Sunday, including top-seeded Simona Halep, who retired from her match against Spain’s Lara Arruabarrena with a recurring Achilles injury.\nBouchard waves to crowd Photo: Getty Images Defending champion Maria Sharapova and world No. 1 Serena Williams also withdrew before the tournament began, citing injuries.\nIn the men’s draw, eighth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France was upset by Austria’s Andreas Haider-Maurer 7-6 (4), 6-2.\nTsonga said afterward that he, too, felt dizzy during the match and he was asked if the heavy pollution in Beijing on Monday had affected his play. According to the U.S. Embassy’s air quality measurements, the PM 2.5 reading hit 292 in the late afternoon, which is considered “very unhealthy” on the index.\n“I don’t know. You know, nothing in me can calculate if it’s enough oxygen for me or not,” he said. “Today I had an opponent, he was just better than me today.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under concussions ,  eugenie bouchard ,  tennis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:32:57.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
