Player: Aamir BrownHeight and Weight: 5'98\", 165. School: Imhotep CharterPosition: Wide Receiver/Defensive BackCamp attended: Harrisburg (March) Camp Evaluation: Pound for pound, Brown was among the top players of the camp. Brown competed on both sides of the ball and made plays throughout the camp. Brown showed he had a second-gear and was one of the fastest players at the camp. Season update: Brown has become one of the most dangerous returners in Pennsylvania. On any other team, Brown would be posting crazy stats due to his prowess on the offensive side of the ball. Imhotep spreads the touches, but when Brown catches passes from the wide receiver position, he usually makes the most of it. As with most Imhotep Charter skill position players, Brown has a ton of speed.
