Each class has constructed their floats and the parade down Washington St. is set for around 2 p.m. today. It’s homecoming week at Sonora High. Old friends will be reunited. Queens and kings will be crowned. And of most importance, the Wildcats will play a football game again Linden in front of large crowd at Dunlavy Field. “Like the coaches have said, homecoming is about the football game,” said Wildcat senior slotback/safety and co-captain Wyatt Faughnan. “We gotta stay focused and not get distracted this week by things that happen around the school like princesses, the queens, the floats, night rally, it’s all fun but you’ve gotta keep your mentality straight.” “The way I look at it, this homecoming is a culmination of four years of football and this is the pinnacle of it,” said Wildcat senior quarterback and co-captain Sammy Page. “I’m just gonna go out there and play 100 percent. I feel our team has worked harder than ever this week. And it’ll be fun going out there and executing in front of a lot of people. Distractions have not got to us. We’re keeping ourselves ready to play football the way our coaches tell us. We’re not trying to get up into all that homecoming rah, rah stuff.” For the Wildcat brass, homecoming week is more like distraction week. There’s a lot of other things the kids can be doing other than preparing for a clash on the gridiron. “Homecoming week is always distraction week,” said Wildcat head coach Bryan Craig. “They wanna be in the air bands, they wanna help with the floats, they wanna be part of the festivities. We have to remind them there would be no festivities without the football game and I think they’ve done a real good job on managing that this week. Practice has been good and they’ve been able to participate in a lot of the other things.” The Wildcats have played the last couple of weeks in front of large crowds and tonight are expecting another. Against Calaveras two weeks ago, about 2,500 fans showed to watch the battle between the Mother Lode League heavyweights at Dunlavy Field. Last week, Thorsted Field in Tuolumne was packed for the ’Cats and Summerville Bears. “Homecoming last year was pretty similar to Summerville last week,” Page said. “So we got a good look at a high-octane game last week with a lot of people so hopefully it won’t be too much of a change for us.” Option battle on gridiron Sonora (6-1) and Linden (1-5) both run an option offense, although the Wildcats have enjoyed much more success this season. The Lions also throw the ball about 45 percent of the time. Not the Wildcats, they throw the ball just 11 percent of the time, 46 passes compared to 359 runs. “They run an offense that is pretty similar to ours,” Craig said. “They’re quarterback is definitely a threat. Their running back is a threat and they’ve got a wideout they can throw the ball to so they’ve got three areas where they can attack us. And their defense, we used to run that a few years back and that always gives you some blocking scheme problems.” Linden is the only team in the MLL that kept pace with Sonora through the first quarter last season. Linden marched 61 yards in nine plays and the game was tied 7-7 after the opening 12 minutes. That 7 points the Lions earned were over 25 percent of the points the Wildcats allowed last season (27) in six league games. The Wildcats went on to win that game 56-7. “They run the option and like to air it out a little bit,” Faughnan said. “Just like any other game, you’ve gotta be ready for the pitch outside or pass going deep, you’ve can’t be fooled by anything.” Kane is definitely able Sonora sophomore Kane Rogers has made quite an impression in his first varsity season and he had a first half to remember last Friday against Tuolumne County foe Summerville. Rogers made his Sac-Joaquin Section leading eighth interception on the sixth play of the game and returned it to the Bears’ 7. He scored on the next play to give the Wildcats a 7-0 lead. After Summerville scored to tie the game, Rogers got free down the middle of the field and Page found him for a 38-yard score and a 14-7 lead. Later in the second quarter, he recovered his second fumble of the season. The slotback/safety capped off the first half by taking a toss from Page and, after rolling to his left, put the ball in his right hand and tossed a 19-yard touchdown pass to Ian Cicero. Tonight’s game begins at 7:30. Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:18:22.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
