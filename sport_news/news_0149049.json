Sabathia. Credit Kathy Willens/Associated Press \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Yankees pitcher C.C. Sabathia said Monday, on the eve of the team’s first playoff game since 2012, that he would check into a rehabilitation center for treatment of alcohol addiction. “I love baseball and I love my teammates like brothers, and I am also fully aware that I am leaving at a time when we should all be coming together for one last push toward the World Series,” he said in a statement released by the team. “It hurts me deeply to do this now, but I owe it to myself and to my family to get myself right. I want to take control of my disease, and I want to be a better man, father and player.” He concluded, “I am looking forward to being out on the field with my team next season playing the game that brings me so much happiness.” The Yankees take on the Houston Astros on Tuesday night in New York in the American League wild-card game. The winner of that game will advance to a division-round series against the Kansas City Royals. OCT. 4, 2015 Sabathia, 35, struggled this season, going 6-10 with an 4.73 E.R.A., but had recently switched to a new knee brace and was pitching far more effectively, to the point where the Yankees were looking at him to be a key contributor in any extended playoff run.

It has been a troubled year in other ways as well. In December, Sabathia became upset at Newark Airport and got into a dispute with airline staff members. In June, he was ejected from a game for the first time since 2006 for arguing balls and strikes. In August, he was involved in a confrontation outside a nightclub in Toronto that led to a brawl, though he was not involved in any fighting. On Thursday, Sabathia pitched five innings and gave up just one run as the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 4-1, and clinched a wild-card berth. It turned out to be the Yankees’ only victory in the last seven games of the regular season. Sabathia has battled his weight over the years, but has been a very effective pitcher for the Indians, the Brewers and, since 2009, the Yankees. His career winning percentage is .624, and he has a 9-5 record in the playoffs. Sabathia joined the Yankees on a seven-year, $160 million contract. In his first season in New York, he was 19-8 and helped lead the team to its 27th championship. In October 2011, Sabathia agreed to a one-year extension of his contract, which was worth $25 million in 2016 with a vesting option in 2017 for another $25 million.
