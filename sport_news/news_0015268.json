Sure seems backward compared to: 'The price went from $1 to $2.' I think it's in the so-called 'Grammar Book.'\" Well, Ron, if it is I haven't found it. Somewhere in the deep recesses of my prefrontal cortex is a hazy memory of being taught the order always should be to somewhere/something from somewhere/something. I can't recall, though, what the rationale is for that. It might have something to do with being less passive. Passive writing is -- or should be -- anathema to news writers. However, the from/to order is far more common. I consulted some grammar texts and came up dry. I've spoken with a couple of my grammar nerd buddies at the paper, including Jim Slusher, our Opinion Page editor who also is a novelist, former English teacher and evil genius. He came up with this example -- from a letter to the editor -- for when one provides greater clarity than the other. \"'That is the same Ronald Reagan who reduced taxes for the uber rich from 70 percent to 28 percent.' The person's phrasing could be misconstrued to make it sound like the writer is giving a range of what the proportion of change was,\" Slusher said. \"It would be clear immediately if he just wrote, 'That is the same Ronald Reagan who reduced taxes for the uber rich to 28 percent from 70 percent.'\" Good point, Jim. In general, I rely on my news instincts. Why not lead with the most important number or place? I went to Paris from Lyon. Paris is the bigger and better place. My salary went from $10 an hour to $2 million a year. I would argue that people know that you're rich now, so your humble start is the surprise. If the result is more important, go with a to/from construction. But if the journey or process is more important, go with the from/to construction.
