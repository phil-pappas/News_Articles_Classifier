Latiolais returned in Week 3, and Karr spent much of his freshman season on the sideline. \nKarr still is behind the multi-talented Latiolais on the quarterback depth chart, but he already has emerged as one of Heath’s top defensive players at linebacker. He helped the Bulldogs to a 31-0 victory Friday against Northridge. \n“I’m loving it. It’s a lot of fun,” said Karr, who spearheaded the defensive effort with juniors Kyle Yoho and Daulton Brown. “I am playing a lot more this year than I did last year. I was on the sidelines a lot. The speed difference is a lot different than JV obviously. It’s just a blast.” \nHeath held Northridge to 206 total yards, and the Bulldogs had a goal-line stand in the third quarter to preserve the shutout. The Bulldogs have held five opponents to 10 points or fewer. \n“(Brown) and I are just trying to get everyone pumped to go out and hit somebody,” Karr said. \nThe Bulldogs have faced a variety of offenses this season, and the final two weeks of the regular season will present a contrast of styles. Lakewood has relied on the pass with quarterback Cole Glaub while Johnstown as always has won with a power-running attack. \n“It’s actually kind of fun because you get to do different things each week,” Karr said. “I know I am in the middle, but I might have to do something different on a certain coverage. You don’t have to play against the same offense every week, (but) I like the smash-mouth football.” \nHeath’s victory against the Vikings stopped a two-game losing streak. A loss to Utica in Week 7 particularly made the Bulldogs a long shot to play their way into contention for a Licking County League-Cardinal Division title and Division IV playoff spot. \nCoach Mark Collier was eager to see how his team would respond. The Bulldogs emphatically did. \n“A lot of our goals are kind of out the window, so now it’s up to who wants to man up and who wants to play for the love of the game,” Collier said. “I like playing meaningful games in October. They are meaningful to us. They might not be real meaningful to other people.” \nLatiolais had another big game running the ball against Northridge, and he is now over 1,000 yards rushing and second in the area in that category. \nHeath’s future is bright with many sophomores and juniors earning vital varsity experience. The young players, however, still have an eye on sending their seniors out the right way. \nA win Friday would give Heath at least its second consecutive .500 season after three consecutive losing seasons. \n“We always hang our hat every year on getting better every week,” Collier said. “We are practicing well. I think we are getting better. We talk about on Friday night ... you have to perform when the spotlight’s on you.” \nksnyder@newarkadvocate.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:10:23.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
