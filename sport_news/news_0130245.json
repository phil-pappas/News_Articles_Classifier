Division Series in Toronto. \n“It’s why you go out and get top performers, elite competitors … situations exactly like this,” manager Jeff Banister said Tuesday. “That’s a comforting feeling that we’ve got a guy on the mound that’s going to go for us that has been here, has done it, and is quite capable of continuing to do it.” \nHamels, the 2008 World Series MVP, will be pitching in a winner-take-all game for the first time when he goes against Blue Jays right-hander Marcus Stroman in a rematch of Game 2 of the ALDS. The Rangers won 6-4 in 14 innings Friday when both starters pitched seven innings and departed with the score 4-4. \n“Who else would you rather have on the mound when you have to win a game than your ace,” catcher Chris Gimenez said. “The fact that he has been there before is really, I think, the biggest confidence boost.” \nHamels is 7-4 with a 3.05 ERA in 14 postseason starts. Utley appeal scheduled Monday \nA person familiar with Chase Utley’s appeal says the hearing for the Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman has been scheduled for Monday. \nThe timing means Utley will be eligible to play in the deciding Game 5 against the Mets on Thursday. \nUtley did not play in Game 3 or 4. \n© Copyright 2015 Associated Press.
