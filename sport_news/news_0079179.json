(Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images) CHICAGO, Ill. - \nThe Chicago Cubs again turned up the power again to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4, winning the National League Division Series. \nThe Cubs advanced to the National League Championship Series to play either the New York Mets or the Los Angeles Dodgers. It is the first postseason series win for Chicago since 2003. \nThe Cardinals quickly jumped on the Cubs in the first. Matt Carpenter singled. Stephen Piscotty then smoked a home run for an early 2-0 lead. The Cubs regained the lead off the bat of Javier Baez in the second-inning. His three-run home run capped a four-run inning. The Cardinals added two runs in the sixth-inning. But the Cubs power returned with a solo home run from Anthony Rizzo in the sixth-inning. Kyle Schwarber crushed a solo home run in the seventh-inning. \nThe Cubs used seven relievers. The last four combined to shut out the Cardinals the last three innings. \nCopyright 2015, Schurz Communications", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:03:40.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
