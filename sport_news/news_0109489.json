With nearly every point contested, the Lady Vikings won 25-23, 25-20, 25-16. “It was our Block Out Cancer game and our seniors last regular season home game so it was an emotional night, and we certainly didn’t come out to play to the best of our ability,” coach Jean LaClair said. “But I am proud of how the kids reacted and kept fighting to pull off the win.” Alexa Ratkowski had 30 assists, eight kills and digs aces, Jill Pyles had seven aces, nine kills and five digs, Allie Sikorski eight kills, 13 digs and two aces and Kirin Cekander added 12 digs and nine kills. Kiera Lasky had 17 digs and one ace, Adyson Lasky 11 digs and three aces, Kiana Mayer added two kills and Clare Mayes had four aces. Bronson battled to overcome an injury to a key back row player. “I thought we handled ourselves well,” LaClair said. “I have always preached that you have to be able to play without any one player, and we did that tonight, with other players stepping in to get the job done. “I thought Centreville played well tonight,” LaClair said. “They served tough and hit well.” One the night over $4,000 was raised for the fight against cancer. Centreville was led by Bailee May with seven kills, 11 digs, four blocks and one assist, Hannah Marchand had four kills, five digs, one assist and one block and Madison Hunter had eight assists, eight digs, four kills and one block. Skyler DeMeyer had nine assists, seven digs, four kills, one ace and one block, Carlee Odom had one ace, one kill and one dig, Sara Lewis and eight digs and Kalee Schrock added six digs, one assist, one ace and one block. “I’m very proud of my girls tonight. They had a game plan, they’ve prepared the last week and did well implementing,” Centreville coach Melissa Gales said. “It’s hard to see them come up short, but I know they played their hearts out. Bronson is number one in the state, always tough and there wasn’t one point I thought we might not win. “We got caught back on our heels a few times and Alexa (Ratkowski) took advantage of those moments,” Gales added. “It was a good night of volleyball.” White Pigeon wins White Pigeon swept New Buffalo in a BCS volleyball match Wednesday night.
