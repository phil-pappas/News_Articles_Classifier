They perceive such risks largely as a product of government policies and institutional processes. Governments take political decisions as far as the distribution, prioritisation, and minimisation of risks are concerned. Over the years, vulnerability of the poor to risks has increased. They suffer from disasters like droughts and catastrophes like earthquakes and even wars. Helping the poor to mitigate such risks is a major challenge for any government. The rich can handle such calamities much better. Here vulnerability refers to reduced ability of people to cope with such events and stressful situations. Untoward situations can be ‘everyday disaster’ like sickness, death in the family, loss of a job, robbery or loss of crop. Thus, it is important that risk analysis is carried out and appropriate interventions are initiated to help those who suffer. Understanding and management of risks is relatively an unexplored subject in India. Though we still are grappling with host of challenges, which have the potential to derail the Indian success story, neither government nor research scholars have given a serious thought to the problem. The idea of this book emerged from an international conference organised at Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (IIMB) in 2011. Rajeev Gowda, a professor of Economics and Social Sciences at IIMB has joined hands with Raphaelle Moor, a London-based consultant, who was in charge of India at Risk project at IIMB for two-and-a-half years, to study different types of risks and degree to which Indian population is subject to different risks. Considering the multi-disciplinary nature of risks, which India must handle, the editors have brought together eminent scholars from different fields to author various chapters. In the first part of the book, Moor delves into sociological-risk literature. She draws upon research conducted in India between 2010 and 2012 and discusses why the conventional risk assessment in India has a technocrat framework, which essentially rests on belief that facts will show the way in due course of time. The book further discusses that all successive governments have always used the formula that risks are worth taking in the interest of ‘progress’. In this context, public administrators Quote: Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, former Prime Minister, ‘The policy of being too cautious is the greatest risk of all.’ In one of the chapters, Gowda discusses the environmental-regulatory structure. India’s vulnerability to natural disasters and post-disaster reconstruction outcome has been discussed in the backdrop of the earthquake that hit Marathawada in 1993. Risks concerning maternal mortality are the subject matter in another chapter. India’s response to HIV/AIDS crisis, its economic, social and health consequences have also been discussed in the book. The authors consider a business management framework for addressing public health risks and rue the fact that there is no comprehensive capacity to communicate, mobilise, implement and enforce disease-management strategies across the country. In section three of the book, authors discuss the science and technology aspects of risk and management, citing many examples of public consultation processes of our Ministry of Environment and Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). The complexity of technical, social, political, economic, organisational, and psychological issues which must be examined in risks management has been explained. This part also analyses lessons learnt by Europe, North America, and Asia in managing risks over the past three decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:05:50.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
