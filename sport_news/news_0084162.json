The nerve. \nAs if he’d spent the last eight years leading Michigan State football out of darkness, building a program beyond imagination and now, Rose Bowl and Big Ten title accomplished, he was coaching the No. 2-ranked team in the country, off to a 4-0 start. \nOh, wait … \nPerhaps MSU’s ninth-year coach was purposely trying to change the mood inside and around his program. Dantonio didn’t look so content after Saturday’s 30-10 win over Central Michigan. Neither did stars Connor Cook or Shilique Calhoun. \nNor did most of you — a fan base struggling to enjoy its wildest dreams. \n“Even us sometimes as a staff,” MSU co-defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett said. “I said after the Air Force game, ‘We won, man!” It’s just like the standards have been set so high amongst all of us. \n“It’s weird. We’re happy, but we’re like, ‘Eh, we could have done this better.’ We have to enjoy it more, in my opinion. But I don’t know if it’s going to happen. This is who we are and how we’re built.” \nA program built to “Chase it” — to borrow Dantonio’s 2013 mantra — not quite sure how to bask in it also. \nThe malaise is multifaceted, all of it natural and explainable, feelings as individual as they are collective. \nFor decades, MSU’s football program and its fans found happiness in hope and moments. \nThe small joys that once accompanied a win over Memphis for a 2-0 start are gone for at least a generation. A Citrus Bowl invitation — the program’s most exciting event between 1987 and at least 2008 — would be met with dread and ticket sales in the hundreds these days. \nMuch of happiness is based in expectations. \nBut there’s more to it.

(Photo: Dave Wasinger/Lansing State Journal) \n“The other thing that’s key here is research on affective forecasting — our ability to predict our emotional responses when things happen,” said Murray State professor Dan Wann, one of the country’s leading researchers in fan psychology. “We expect to be happier than we actually are when good things happen. \n“People might say, ‘Gosh, can you imagine if we were ranked in the top five? That would be the most amazing thing ever in my entire life.’ But when they get there, it’s just not quite as amazing as you thought. It’s amazing, don’t get me wrong, we love it. But it’s not this watershed moment, OK-I-can-die-now kind of moment that people think.” \nIn other words, the joy is mostly in the journey — Pasadena two years ago being perhaps the exception. And the bulk of the journey is over. \nNo fan or administrator, player or coach would trade places with where the program was at the turn of the millennium at the Citrus Bowl, but just about everyone associated with MSU was happier then than they were Saturday. Is criticism about MSU defense overblown? \nThat would be the case for any program with a similar rise. \nSome of the feelings I’ve heard, though, are MSU specific. This is a long-tortured football fan base. Old fears die hard. \nA caller on a local radio show this week described MSU football fans as having lived “an abused dog’s life.” \nTrust is difficult. \n“I think it’s human nature to be looking to say, ‘OK, here they are, here they are, when are they going to fall, when is that shoe going to fall?’” Dantonio said. \nLike Barnett, who arrived as a player at MSU in 1985, Dantonio has spent a sizable chunk of his adult life around East Lansing. Winning every week, being ranked in the top five, beating Michigan regularly — this is all still new money to MSU. \n“It often times will lead the fans to be a little tepid in their responses, a little reserved, because it’s a fan base that very clearly remembers the other side of the coin,” Wann said. “So you almost don’t want to get your hopes up too high. \n“The failure was so long in the making that it really resonates in the psyche.” \nOr you’re too young to remember it and not equipped to fully appreciate what’s in front of you. Rexrode: Panic or perspective? MSU mailbag decides \nAs a physiological study, MSU’s collective football fan base is a tangled mess. \nThis is the greatest era of Spartan athletics. There is no other school anywhere with a better situation in both football and men’s basketball. \nThat bears repeating — perhaps to yourself over and over on Saturdays this fall. \n“Sometimes I wish I was just a fan watching again, rather than coaching,” Barnett said. “This has to be a fun time to be a fan. I remember the bad days, the ‘Come on, let’s play hard and not get blown out.’ \n“If you get to the point where you’re all anxious watching, just think back some years ago.” \nBarnett gets it, though. This program spent four decades chasing respect and then found it. \n“How do you maintain it and not only maintain it, enjoy it?” he said. “We’re still trying to figure that part out.” \nContact Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.
