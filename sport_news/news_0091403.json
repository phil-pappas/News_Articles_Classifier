The cause of the fire is under investigation.\nTo the north and east, several large, destructive wildfires burning on prairie lands have destroyed more than a dozen homes, killed livestock and forced evacuations over the past few days.\nFires with volcano-like smoke plumes visible for miles around have broken out from the Rockies almost to the Mississippi River.\nAmple rain during the spring and summer made matters worse by encouraging prairie grass to grow into deep, thick wildfire fuels.\n\"All they needed was a spark,\" said Kelly Allen, a National Weather Service fire program manager in Riverton, Wyoming. \"Now they're finally burning. The fuel bed is almost continuous.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:03:37.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
