(Mark Almond/malmond@al.com) (MARK ALMOND) Comments \nAuburn was relying on experience as it prepared for its second Thursday night road game in as many years. \nThe Tigers (3-2, 0-2 SEC) are looking to earn their first conference win of the season and get their season back on track tonight against Kentucky in the first Thursday night game ever at Commonwealth Stadium. \nRELATED: Auburn out to prove 'we're not as bad as people think we are' \nIt's nothing new to Auburn, which won at Kansas State on a Thursday night last season. The Tigers are 21-24-4 all-time in Thursday games, including 1-0 against Kentucky, and is 17-23-3 on the road in such contests. \n\"Thursday night games away are challenging, there's no doubt,\" Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said, \"because the crowd and everything that goes with that.\" \nRELATED: Auburn vs. Kentucky TV, key matchups, players to watch \nBoth Auburn and Kentucky had a bye leading into the short week, making the game week routine slightly off on the calendar as the schedule was moved up two days beginning last Saturday. \nIt was a bit comical for Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp, who insisted last week's college football slate occurred on what was a \"Monday\" for Auburn.

(Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) \n\"I told the kids (Sunday), 'Regardless of what anybody tells you, today's Tuesday and tomorrow's going to be Wednesday and the next day's going to be Thursday and then we're going to travel on Friday and we're going to play on Saturday. So whatever anybody tells you, they're lying to you,'\" Muschamp said. \"That's how you approach it. You buy into that, and I've totally bought into that. ... At the end of the day both have to go through the same routine and certainly it will be a great environment there in Lexington.\" \nThough Kentucky isn't as seasoned with Thursday night games, having never played one at Commonwealth Stadium and last playing at home on Thursday in 1939, Wildcats coach Mark Stoops knows what a win on national TV can do for a program. \nRELATED: Stoops excited to play AU in first Thursday night game at CWS \nStoops was defensive coordinator at Arizona in his last home Thursday night game in 2007, when the Wildcats upset then No. 2 Oregon. \nAs Kentucky (4-1, 2-1 SEC) looks to snap Auburn's eight-game win streak in Lexington, which dates back to 1966 , a win on the national stage would mean a lot to Stoops and his team. \n\"When you're building a program wins are super important, certainly in this conference playing a team like Auburn,\" Stoops said. \"It'll be a tough, hard-fought game and getting a victory on Thursday night will certainly help. I think there's a lot of people that watch this game. There's not a whole heck of a lot of games on on Thursday night. \n\"The opportunity to play on national TV against Auburn and if we were fortunate enough to get a victory, it would mean a great deal to our program in just the exposure and continue to build the excitement that we have going on here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:54:29.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
