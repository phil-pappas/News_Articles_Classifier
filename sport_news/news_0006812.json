(AP) - Children's advocates are urging the Mississippi Department of Education to ban the use of seclusion and restraint for school discipline.\nThe department has drafted a proposed policy and is taking public comments before presenting it to the state Board of Education.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi says this is one of five states without a policy or law to govern when and how school employees can restrain students or put them in seclusion.\nDuring a public hearing Wednesday, Heather Rhodes said she has a 9-year-old son with autism. She said an employee at a south Mississippi school once put him in a black wooden box called the \"chill zone\" when he was screaming. Rhodes says she arrived when that was happening, and it angered her.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:19:10.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
