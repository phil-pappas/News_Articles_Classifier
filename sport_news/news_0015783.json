He emerged from that hiatus to lead the Cavaliers within two wins of the NBA title.\nThough the back problems are a recurring issue, the website reported it’s not seen as a “significant issue.”\nCavaliers coach David Blatt had dropped hints Thursday, saying James might not play for the remainder of the preseason — games Sunday in Toronto and at home Monday against Dallas. James played in just two of the first five preseason games.\n“We’ll see what happens at the beginning of next week,” Blatt said. “I certainly don’t expect him to play both games and I don’t know if he’ll even play one. We’ll see.\n“We want to take good care of him for the start of the season. As you know in his great and storied career, he has amassed a lot of miles. We’re trying to keep those preseason miles to a minimum.”\nThe Cavaliers open the regular season at the Bulls on Oct. 27.\nWith AP \n  cleveland cavaliers ,  lebron james", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:47:13.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
