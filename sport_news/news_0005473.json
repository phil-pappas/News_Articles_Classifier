Mancina finished with 17 saves. \n\"It's a win, (there was) a lot of good stuff,\" said head coach Jeff Brown, who wasn't pleased with the six minor penalties his team took, though he was happy with the penalty killers that allowed just one power play goal. \"It was a good win. It's unfortunate we weren't ready to go on Wednesday (a 5-2 loss to Mississauga), it could have been a great homestand. But two wins in the last two, is good.\" \nSophomore goalie Leo Lazarev, a bit of a surprise start after Liam Herbst picked up the win Friday, was solid in making 33 stops. He saw his shutout bid spoiled by C.J. Clarke in the third period as the Russian goalie kicked out a big rebound on the power play, giving Clarke an open net to tap it in. \nBrown likes what he's seen from the young Russian in his second season and is happy to split the minutes between his goalies while both are playing well. \n\"We've got confidence in both guys and nobody's really the number one guy,\" Brown said. \"(Lazarev) has been very good against Peterborough too, so that was another thing.\" \nLazarev, now in his third year living in Canada and growing increasingly more comfortable as his English improves, said he was happy with his performance, other than the rebound he kicked out on Peterborough's lone goal. \n\"The team helped me and it's a nice win, now we have to be ready for the road trip,\" Lazarev said of the club's next three games away from TD Place in North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie and Sudbury. \nLazarev said it's important for the team to have both goalies playing well. \n\"It's really nice, a good opportunity for me to be better,\" he said. \"(He and Herbst) fight for time in the net, it's really good.\" \nGoaltending aside, the 67's won't lose often if Konecny and Salituro keep going the way they are now. Salituro has three goals and three assists in his last four games, while Konecny has three goals and seven assists in the same time frame and now leads the league in points with 22 in 13 games. \n\"They're the X factor, right?\" Brown said. \"When they've got it going offensively, it's good. I didn't think we were great (Sunday), I thought we were alright, but they were very good offensively and that was the difference.\" \nDefenceman Nevin Guy was the healthy scratch among the four overage players and Brown was asked again about the system after the game, a question that comes up regularly. He said he has no plans to move one of them unless someone makes an offer he can't refuse, calling the extra player an \"insurance\" policy should one of the other veterans go down. \nThe 67's are back in action Thursday when they hit the road to take on the North Bay Battalion. \n67's name alternate captains \nThey may be clear choices to most who follow the Ottawa 67's, but coach Jeff Brown didn't want to rush deciding who his alternate captains would be this season. \nEarly in the year, only captain Travis Konecny wore a letter on his jersey, but Brown has since rounded out the official leadership group, giving As to forward Sam Studnicka and defenceman Jake Middleton. Studnicka wore the letter last year after Erik Bradford was traded at the deadline. \n\"They've been our leaders, Midzy on the back end and Studs up front,\" Brown said. \"We thought we'd reward them.\" \nThe leadership group now features a high-end offensive power, a strong two-way forward and a defenceman, all with different personalities. \n\"(Konecny) sometimes leads by example, not so much in the locker room, whereas those guys are kind of the voice in the locker room (and) they haven't disappointed.\" \nKonecny and Middleton are NHL prospects with Philadelphia and Los Angeles, respectively, while Studnicka got a free agent invite to Montreal Canadians training camp this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:27:27.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
