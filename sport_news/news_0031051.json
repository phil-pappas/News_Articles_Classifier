The 56-year-old is thought to be ready to return to work after a back operation, but he does not chime as perfectly with the FSG philosophy as Klopp. \nFrank de Boer (NED) \nAge: 45 \nTeams managed: Ajax (NED/2010-date) \nFormerly a classy, ball-playing centre-back, De Boer led Ajax to four consecutive Eredivisie titles between 2010 and 2014 before finishing second behind PSV Eindhoven last season. \nWhile he lacks top-level experience, having never coached in the Champions League knockout phase, he has a proven track record when it comes to developing young players. \nIn a BBC interview last week, he expressed interest in working in England, and described Liverpool as a “fantastic club”. \nRonald Koeman (NED) \nAge: 52 \nTeams managed: Vitesse Arnhem (NED/2000-01), Ajax (NED/2001-05), Benfica (POR/2005-06), PSV Eindhoven (NED/2006-07), Valencia (ESP/2007-08), AZ Alkmaar (NED/2009), Feyenoord (NED/2011-14), Southampton (ENG/2014-date) \nSince arriving at Southampton in 2014, Koeman has impressed by keeping the south-coast club punching above their weight despite the departure of several key players. \nThey finished seventh in his first season and stunned defending champions Chelsea on Saturday with a superb 3-1 victory at Stamford Bridge. \nBut he is barely a year into a three-year contract and does not appear to possess the “X factor” that Liverpool are looking for in their next head coach. \nJurgen Klinsmann (GER) \nAge: 51 \nTeams managed: Germany (2004-06), Bayern Munich (GER/2008-09), United States (2011-date) \nA left-field candidate, United States coach Klinsmann has been given odds of 20-1 to succeed Rodgers by British bookmakers. \nThe 51-year-old knows about English football from his two spells with Tottenham Hotspur in the 1990s, and laid the foundations for Germany’s 2014 World Cup success during his two-year spell as national coach between 2004 and 2006. \nThe former Germany striker led the United States out of a daunting group at the World Cup, but his only experience of club management was a disappointing spell at Bayern Munich that lasted less than a year. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:39:48.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
