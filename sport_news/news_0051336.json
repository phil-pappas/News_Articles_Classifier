With strong contenders like China staying away, a field of 22 shooters in men's 10m air rifle doesn't sound too challenging. The tournament, which has been scheduled ahead of the last qualifying event for the Rio Olympics, the Asian Championships in Kuwait, will thus struggle to get attention due to non-participation of some key nations.\nCountries like South Korea and Japan have sent their second string teams as their main shooters are busy preparing for the available quota places for Rio Games.\nThe poor participation has affected the event to such an extent that winners in a couple of events will not be eligible for medals. And, if they shoot world-record scores, it will not be recognized.For instance, there are only 13 participants in the 10m air pistol women's event. For scores to be recognized by the international body (ISSF), the competition should have a minimum of 15 entries.\nFormer world No. 1 Heena Sidhu is in the fray.\nThings are worse in the 10m pistol junior women's event which features just five participants. The winner will not get an Asian medal as the minimum shooters required for the event is six.\nHowever, in the men's event, Bindra and Narang should be mo tivated enough as the two will face off in an international event after a long gap.\nBoth had shot here during the 2010 Commonwealth Games where Narang shot a world record equaling score and won gold, while Bindra took silver.\nBut things have changed a lot in the last five years. Apart from the change in the format, both the shooters have also seen fluctuations in their form. With no prominent opponent in the field, Bindra, Gagan and Chain Singh will fight for the gold.\nAll three have already won quotas for the Rio Olympics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:56:40.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
