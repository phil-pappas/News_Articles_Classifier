NY Mets Take Early 1-0 Lead on Kershaw, Dodgers in Game 1 of NLDS Daniel Murphy hit a solo home run off Clayton Kershaw in the top half of the fourth inning and the New York Mets jumped out to an early 1-0 lead on the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the NLDS at Dodger Stadium.

(Photo by Stephen Dunn/Getty Images) Daniel Murphy hit a 94 mph fastball into the Mets bullpen in right field, and New York has a 1-0 lead on Clayton Kershaw and the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the National League Division Series at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw has eight strikeouts through four innings, but he left a fastball up to Murphy who put the Mets on the scoreboard. Kershaw is looking to remove the playoff monkey from his back as the three-time Cy Young Award winner has struggled in the postseason over the course of his career. Kershaw has a record of 1-5 with a 5.12 ERA in the postseason. Last year's Rookie of the Year Jacob DeGrom is opposing Kershaw in his first playoff start of his career. DeGrom has seven strikeouts in three scoreless innings of work. Mets left-fielder Michael Cuddyer has misplayed two balls in left field, both of which turned into doubles for the Dodgers. Justin Turner and Corey Seager both hit two-baggers for the Boys in Blue, but were left stranded after DeGrom got out of each jam with strikeouts. The Mets are playing in their first postseason since 2006, after a strong second half of the season saw them surge past the Washington Nationals in the NL East. The Dodgers have won the NL West for the third consecutive season, but have yet to reach the World Series, going out at the hands of the St. Louis Cardinals each of the past two seasons.
