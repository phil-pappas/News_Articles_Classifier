He figured it made as much sense to play in the slop on Thursday as it did Friday or Monday. The Knights didn’t seem to mind the mud or the steady rain that was heavy at times, controlling both lines of scrimmage and time of possession in a 20-6 win over longtime rival Summerville. “They were telling me there was a window at first,” Marion said. “I said if it’s supposed to rain 10 inches by Sunday, I said would you rather play on the field after five inches of rain or 10 inches of rain. It’s going to tear up the field either way.” Stratford won the yardage battle 312 to 125, getting 104 yards rushing from Omari Johnson and 102 more from quarterback J.D Davis in its second straight victory after three straight losses. The Knights (3-3) travel to Cane Bay on Friday for the Region 7-AAAA opener for both teams. “You’ve got to give a lot of credit to the teams we played in the first part of the season,” Marion said. “Ashley Ridge is 6-0. Fort Dorchester is 6-0. We knew we had lot of positions to replace, but our kids have continued to work hard and they’re getting better.” Stratford struck first midway through the second quarter. Johnson took a pitch 18 yards around the left side but the extra point was no good, leaving it 6-0. The Knights added to their lead on the opening drive of the second half. Savien Wittrell’s 8-yard run capped the drive and Davis raced in on a 2-point try, making it 14-0 with 9:04 left in the third quarter. Summerville’s moments of brilliance on offense were few, but the Green Wave (2-5) did manage to put together a strong drive early in the fourth quarter. Quarterback John Bennett tossed a 38-yard pass to set up Chris Felder’s 4-yard touchdown with 9:23 left in the game. The try for two was no good. After an exchange of punts, Stratford took over at its own 41 with over three minutes left and a chance to ice it. Mike White ripped off a 24-yard run and then Davis got loose for 35 more to the Wave 1. White plunged straight ahead with 1:31 left to seal Summerville’s third straight loss since blanking Goose Creek, 21-0, on Sept. 11. It doesn’t get any easier for first-year Wave coach Joe Call next week. Summerville travels to unbeaten rival Fort Dorchester.
