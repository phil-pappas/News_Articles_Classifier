Lee and teammate Tim Amundson (1-under 69) sit atop the leaderboard. They were the only players to break par Monday.\nSilver Creek's Jackson Solem and Windsor's Cole Krantz shot even par; Valor's Coby Welch was at 71.\nThe Eagles opened with a torrid 3-under 207 total, 18 shots clear of Evergreen.\nIn the Class 3A tournament, Peak to Peak's first round was solid — teammates Nishant Datta and Sam Taylor shot even-par 72s and lead by three strokes at Eagle Ranch Golf Club in Eagle.
