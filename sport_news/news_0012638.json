A year later, he’s become the team’s clear No. 1 cornerback.\n“There’s no question about that,” Patriots coach Bill Belichick said when the topic of Butler’s increased responsibilities was broached. “His role is that he’s out on the field for almost every defensive play, so that’s a big change from where it was last year. Malcolm is a good football player and he’s played very well for us both last year and this year.”\nIn his sophomore season, Butler has been targeted frequently and competed well. The young corner hasn’t been perfect, but he’s broken up six passes and intercepted another in five games. On a conference call yesterday, Belichick spoke highly of Butler’s role.\n“Given where we are in the secondary and the level of improvement, I think that no matter who we had on our team that he would be playing a lot of football for us,” he said. “So that’s really a credit to him and how much that he’s improved from last year to this year.”\nLast year’s vaunted secondary consisted of Darrelle Revis , Brandon Browner and Kyle Arrington at cornerback. Belichick saying that Butler would be playing no matter the roster is a serious compliment.\nEven with the impressive ascension, the coach thinks the best is yet to come from the undrafted cornerback.\n“He’s playing well. He does a lot of good things for us and there’s still a lot of room for him to improve. I don’t think he’s hit the peak, but he’s getting better and I thought he played well last week,” Belichick said.\nButler will have his hands full on Sunday in Foxboro with the Jets’ Brandon Marshall. New York’s No. 1 wide receiver is averaging more than 100 yards per game and has hauled in four touchdown passes in five games.\nNew Jet power\nIt’s clear Rex Ryan is no longer running the show for the Jets.\nWhen Ryan led the Jets, every matchup with the Patriots was a war of words in addition to a battle on the field. Ryan hyped early-season games with the Pats to the point they were jokingly dubbed Super Bowls.\nWith their new coach, things are different. The Jets are off to a 4-1 start under Todd Bowles , and he sounds more like the Patriots head coach when he steps to the podium.\n“It’s a division game for us. We want to win division games. It’s still one game at a time. Winning this game is not going to make us, losing this game is not going to break us. So, we’re going to take the same approach we’ve been taking,” Bowles said. “You don’t want to say you get up or down for one game, because that means you haven’t been playing hard in the first place.”\nThen, Bowles borrowed a phrase directly from Belichick.\n“We’re going to continue to do our job and get better as a team, and we’ll go forward from there,” he said.\nSunday will be Revis’ first game in Foxboro since signing a $70 million deal to rejoin the Jets. Another former Patriot eligible to return is Stevan Ridley . The running back has been on New York’s PUP list recovering from a torn ACL, and the Week 7 meeting is the first time he can suit up.\nBowles said step one is getting Ridley on the practice field.\n“Hopefully we can get him in pads and just let him run around,” Bowles said. “I hope to get Ridley back in.”\nWill he play?\n“Maybe,” Bowles said, channeling Belichick once again.\nNo regrets in Indy\nThe play was so bad it already has gone viral as “the snapfu.”\nTrailing the Patriots 27-21 late in the third quarter, Indianapolis shifted out of punt formation on a fourth-and-3, and everyone but the makeshift center Griff Whalen and quarterback Colt Anderson sprinted to the right side of the field.\nThe Pats didn’t take the bait as several defenders remained near the ball, yet the Colts still snapped the ball. Anderson was crushed for a loss and Indy turned the ball over on downs.\nThe comically bad trick play will be a blooper reel staple for years to come, but Colts coach Chuck Pagano is standing by his ill-advised call.\n“I don’t regret the play call,” he said. “I obviously didn’t do a good enough job of coaching the play, because we were aligned incorrectly, and I didn’t communicate well enough with them about what to do if we didn’t get the Patriots to call a timeout or have too many men on the field. That’s all on me.”\nThe Patriots marched down the short field to take a two-score lead, and cruised to victory. Despite the collapse, Pagano thought his team’s effort was promising.\n“I think we showed that we can play with anyone,” he said. “That loss last night was more about what we did to ourselves. It is like we say — the enemy is always in your camp, and it is the friendly fire that gets you.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:49.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
