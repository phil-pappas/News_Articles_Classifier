Liles, USA TODAY Sports)\n6 CONNECT 28 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TALLADEGA, Ala. — After an unusual and controversial victory Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway, Joey Logano drove through a shower of cans and bottles to get to victory lane.\nNone of which bothered NASCAR’s latest villain, perceived or otherwise.\n“I was aiming for them,” Logano joked after winning the CampingWorld.com 500 when a multi-car crash ended the race shortly after a green-white-checkered restart. “I was thirsty. I was aiming for everything. It’s kind of a cool explosion when you hit beer cans and stuff. It explodes all over the place.”\nThe ugly incident, in which fans booed loudly and pelted the track with cans and bottles, was the product of a bizarre ending in which the initial final restart was aborted and the restart that counted lasted for a second under green before quickly turning yellow for another crash.\nUSA TODAY\nKevin Harvick's faltering car brings accusations over Talladega finish\nThe result was Logano’s sixth victory this season in the Team Penske No. 22 Ford and a sweep of the three races in the Contender Round of the Chase.\n“The team is going on all eight right now,” Logano said. “It’s amazing — all these different types of racetracks we’ve been able to win at this season and how hard everyone keeps fighting. We want the big trophy at the end of the year. We want to win every trophy in between, but we want the big one at the end of the season.\n“What we’ve shown in this latest round is a big deal, but the fact of the matter is that we’re back to zero again. What we do have going for us that other teams don’t have is a lot of confidence. We’ve got momentum, and we’re relaxed. We’ve shown that we know how to do it. We’ve just got to keep going out there and do what we know how to do.”\nWATCH: Logano celebrates in Talladega victory lane\nWhat they know how to do is dominate Sprint Cup races. Logano won three races this season — including the Daytina 500 -- before claiming second-round wins at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Kansas Speedway and Talladega.\nThey haven’t come without controversy, though. Matt Kenseth fumed after he tangled with Logano and spun out while racing for the lead during the final laps at Kansas. On Sunday, when Logano suddenly darted across Kenseth’s nose to get to pit lane, Kenseth told his crew over the radio that he would “knock him out” and that Logano would be “hiding behind his daddy.”\nThe controversy, along with the weird ending that left crowd favorite Dale Earnhardt Jr. in second place and prevented him from reaching the eight-driver Eliminator Round that begins next week, culminated in the crowd’s angry reaction.\nNone of which seemed to bother Logano.\n“It was kind of interesting,” Logano said. “Usually there’s one or two, but that was kind of like it was raining out there. It was kind of a new thing, but that’s OK. Everyone is passionate about their driver, and that’s what makes our sport great. I appreciate the passion that our fans have, and I think that’s something that’s really cool to see about the way that people act for their driver. It is what it is. It doesn’t hurt my race car. Our race cars are built strong, so they can hit a lot of stuff and keep on rolling.”\nA quick pit stop late in the race got Logano off pit road ahead of the field and into second place, trailing only Greg Biffle, who stayed out and was attempting to make it to the end of the race without a pit stop. But when Biffle was forced to pit for fuel while the field was idling under caution in anticipation of the final restart, Logano found himself in the lead.\nThat’s when he chose the outside line, which prevented Earnhardt from lining up with Hendrick Motorsports teammate Jeff Gordon.\nUSA TODAY\nDale Earnhardt Jr. 'totally OK' with G-W-C finish at Talladega\n“I didn’t really want to stack the 24 and 88 together in one lane,” said Logano’s crew chief, Todd Gordon. “We knew Brad (Keselowski) was in really good position as far as making it to the next round, and we felt that by splitting the Hendrick cars and ourselves up, we could get a better run.”\nFor team owner Roger Penske, the broad goal is to get Logano and Brad Keselowski in contention at the season finale Nov. 22 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The more specific goal is the team’s first championship since Keselowski won in 2012.\n“If we’d sat down prior to this round and somebody had said we’re going to win all three, you’d say they were crazy,” Penske said. “But I think (it’s) the execution of Todd and Joey driving at the top of his game. … Moving on the next round is going to be tough. Our goal is to get to Homestead with the 2 and the 22.”\nAs for how the fans react to that? It’s simple, Logano says. Don’t throw ‘em. Drink ‘em.\n“It’s kind of a shame they were throwing their beers full,” Logano said. “I feel bad. They probably should have drank them.”\nFollow Olson on Twitter @jeffolson77\nPHOTOS: Highlights from the 2015 Chase for the Sprint Cup\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Highlights from the 2015 Chase for the Sprint Cup Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
