Oaks Amusement Park, 7805 S.E. Oaks Park Way, oregoncraftbeer.org/freshhops Fresh Hop Ale Festival, Oct. 3 A bit further afield, though closer to the source, Yakima, Wash.'s Fresh Hop Ale Festival claims to be \"the original fresh hop beer festival,\" according to its website. And why not? Found at the heart of Washington's bountiful hop-growing region, this year's festival expects to gather more than 100 beers from 40 breweries. 7 South 3rd St., Yakima, Wash.; 509-388-6641; freshhopalefestival.com St. Paul Fresh Hop Fest, Oct. 10 Bringing up the rear, this small-but-growing festival offers 20 fresh hop beers, bites from Hubbard's From Russia With Love and college football on a big-screen TV, according to the festival's website. Participating breweries include Crux Fermentation Project, Up Town Market and Thunder Island Brewing. Jaycee's Bullpen, 4258 Park Ave., St. Paul; stpaulfreshhopfestival.com Read more of Mike Russell's fresh hop fest round-up SILVERTON â€“ Steve Dresler plunged his hands wrist-deep into bright green hops, thousands deep, laying out to dry at 125 degrees. He let them cascade over his hands and back into the pile, rubbing one between his palms and ripping it in half to smell it.\nThen Dresler took a step back as his colleagues from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co . swarmed Gayle Goschie, owner of Goschie Hop Farms . Dresler, head brewer for the Chico, California, craft beer outfit, has been through these tours many times.\nDresler was frankly more interested in another group milling about the drying platform, built above furnaces pushing heat through the wooden floor.\nTwo guys from Ninkasi Brewing Co. were filling sacks with Cascade hops before they could fall from a conveyor belt onto the drying bed. They were taking 800 pounds of wet hops back to Eugene to throw into an already-boiling kettle to create this year's batch of fresh-hop Green Haze Pale Ale.\nNinkasi, in its ninth year making a fresh-hop beer, is reportedly following in the footsteps of Dresler, who brewed the first batch in the United States nearly two decades ago.\nSince that first batch, fresh-hop beers have caught fire. Oregon and Washington brewers picked up the trend early, and are now positioned to dominate a significant part of the market for these most limited edition of beers. They can only be made once a year, during the hop harvest, and only last as long as the brewers' fresh hop supply.\nThere are hundreds of brewers within a day's drive of the hop-growing powerhouses in the Pacific Northwest. Whereas Sierra Nevada must get fresh hops sent by next-day air, Ninkasi and Laurelwood Brewpub were part of a stream of brewers from around the region who flooded Goschie's farm, just like other hop farms in the Willamette and Yakima valleys.\n Dresler got the idea from a hop handler from the United Kingdom over lunch one day. Abroad, brewers had for years been making beer without drying the hops first. The oils in hops cause them to turn into compost quickly -- within hours of being picked, they begin decomposing. If the cones aren't dried before being rolled into storage bales, they also heat up and can combust.\nBut those oils produce smells and tastes in beer when brewed right away that hooked Dresler.\n\"The aromatics were mind-boggling,\" Dresler said.\nDresler has always used Cascade and Centennial hops for his fresh-hop beers, and chatted with other brewers picking up their sacks about what they were using. He is going to the Yakima Fresh Hop Ale Festival this year -- the granddaddy of fresh hop events -- for the first time to see what the competition is coming up with.\nHow are fresh hop beers made? Molly Harbarger takes you on a trip from farm to kettle with Ninkasi Brewing Co. as they make their fresh hop pale ale, Green Haze. The hop industry in the Yakima Valley was one of the first to seize on the growing popularity of fresh-hop beers. They put together the first fresh hop festival in the country, with the ethos that it would be like a farm-to-table dinner for beer lovers.\n\"We always say fresh hops is when beer comes home,\" said Joe Nation, the festival director.\nWhen Karl Vanevenhoven, senior vice president of operations for hop handler Yakima Chief-Hopunion, joined the festival organizing committee in 2007, there were about a dozen breweries who brought one, maybe two, fresh hop beers with them. The styles were all over the board -- stouts competing against IPAs, pale ales competing against sours.\nNow, more than 40 breweries attend, bringing more than 100 beers between them. The competition has been narrowed down to just three styles. And attendance has grown from 1,000 to more than 6,000.\n\"The beers truly do taste different -- more aromatic, depending on brewing technique, they can have more of a vegetative flavor, like chewing on a hop cone,\" Vanevenhoven said. \"If you're a hop head, it's definitely a beer of choice.\"\nBrewers embraced it not just for the flavor, but the challenge. Unlike chefs, they rarely get to work with just-picked ingredients. At Ninkasi, they use pellet forms of hops for most of their beers, which are not just dried, but broken apart and then compressed into pellets and bagged. They take less space for the Eugene brewer that has only recently expanded, and still doesn't have enough room for whole-cone hop storage.\n So this season is one of the few times a year Ninkasi brewer Annan Pederson gets to throw 400 pounds of tiny green pinecone-shaped hops into his brew. It's as much as treat for him as the beer enthusiast.\n\"It's definitely highly seasonable. It only comes when the hops are ready to be harvested,\" Pederson said. \"It's really special once a year.\"\n-- Molly Harbarger\nmharbarger@oregonian.com\n503-294-5923\n@MollyHarbarger", "external_links": ["http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/?ageVerified=defaultValue", "https://twitter.com/MollyHarbarger", "http://goschiefarms.com/", "http://www.sierranevada.com/", "http://www.freshhopalefestival.com/", "http://www.laurelwoodbrewpub.com/"], "published": "2015-10-02T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:13:40.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
