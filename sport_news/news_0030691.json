When the Borleske Stadium clock hit double zero at the end of the fourth quarter, the Blue Devils commenced a Senior Night celebration after clinching an MCC Class 4A playoff berth and handing the visiting Falcons their third straight loss. Junior running back Sam Hoe carried the ball 31 times for 118 of Wa-Hi’s 305 rushing yards and scored four touchdowns, while the Blue Devil defense produced four interceptions in a 42-34 triumph. Quarterback Mitch Lesmeister contributed 111 yards on 13 totes and senior Noah Porter delivered 76 yards on 11 carries as Wa-Hi improved its overall record to 3-5 and dropped Class 3A Hanford to 4-4. Both teams are now 2-4 in the conference. “It was great as a coach to watch the kids celebrate,” Wa-Hi coach Eric Hisaw said. “The seniors will remember this as long as they live.” The Falcons, who sport the MCC’s top passing offense, soared in the opening minutes of the game. Freshman quarterback Josh Fonner hit wide receiver Kedrick Skinner with a 33-yard touchdown strike at the 9:08 mark of the first quarter to give Hanford a 6-0 lead. Lesmeister got his team even just a minute and 19 seconds later on a 33-yard scoring scamper that finished off a five-play drive of 70 yards. The Blue Devils started their second offensive series at the Hanford 49-yard line following a J.C. Wicklund interception. Hoe went up and over from a yard out six plays after the pick to put Wa-Hi up 12-6. Lesmeister increased the Blue Devils’ lead to 12, 18-6, with a 1-yard touchdown run at the 4:35 mark of the second quarter. Hoe advanced 40 yards on the ground during the 77-yard march that was kept alive by an illegal substitution penalty on a fourth-and-2 snap at the Wa-Hi 31. The teams exchanged kickoff returns for touchdowns over the next 28 seconds. Hanford’s Jamil Woodhouse raced 69 yards to paydirt and Hoe responded with a 76-yard jaunt to the end zone. Hoe and the Blue Devils ended the first half on a positive note. Wa-Hi began its final possession before halftime on the Falcons’ 45. Hoe closed out the series on a 13-yard run with 21 seconds on the clock. The Blue Devils led 30-13 at intermission. “That was about as solid as we’ve played all year (on offense),” Hisaw said. “We were clean, crisp, did a good job on first down, and played with a lot of energy.” Hanford, which netted minus-5 yards total offense and one first down after its initial offensive thrust of the night, got itself back in the game with three third-quarter touchdowns. Fonner connected with Desmond Samples for a 39-yard T.D., Tayvonne Miller ran for a 64-yard score, and Elwood Davis added a 1-yard run for six. Prior to Davis’ touchdown, Lesmeister unleashed a 21-yard bolt to senior tight end Garrett Bannister at the 6:19 mark for Wa-Hi’s lone score of period three. “I knew it was going to be open and Mitch did a great job getting the ball to me,” Bannister said. “It means a lot to get a touchdown and the win in the last home game of my high school career.” “It was a designed play to get the linebackers to come up,” Lesmeister said. “Garrett got open and I threw him the ball.” The Blue Devils took a 36-34 edge to the fourth quarter. Hoe capped the scoring on a 10-yard rush with 6:55 left in the game. The carry was the final snap on a seven-play, 54-yard drive that the Falcons assisted with offside, unsportsmanlike conduct, and pass interference penalties. “We wanted to come out and play hard for (the seniors),” Hoe said. “The coaches talked all week about consistency — something we haven’t had recently on both sides of the ball.” Hanford managed just 43 yards on their final four possessions of the game. The first three ended with interceptions, one by Hoe and a pair by Isaiah Moss, and the last gasp was a turnover on downs after four incompletions. On the first incomplete pass, senior defensive lineman Ryan Rogel earned a hurry on Fonner that caused the errant throw. “We were getting the ball thrown on us a little bit, but we (the defensive linemen) started getting through,” Rogel said. “It (the win) feels great. It’s been a lot of fun to play with these guys. I wouldn’t choose a different group of guys to play with.” “We got pressure up front,” Hisaw said. “The kids went for and got the football (on the interceptions). “The kids earned this win,” Hisaw said. “We didn’t let it fall through our fingers.” Linebacker Layne Peters also chimed in afterward. “I will remember this for the rest of my life,” Peters said. “We can be a great team when we want to be. We’re good enough to go to the playoffs.” Friday’s game was the final home affair for Blue Devil seniors Porter, Wicklund, Bannister, Rogel, Peters, Kendall Knight, Brandon Laughery, Evan Jameson, Steven Herbert, Lucas Rassbach, Juan Garcia, Joe Yenney, Kurt Blackman, Ryan Sullivan, and Will Brown.
