Bills general manager Doug Whaley didn't have much more insight into the situation on Friday. \n\"Still just a personal reason that he's out, and we'll address it as soon as we get some more answers on him,\" Whaley said. Browns: Coach Mike Pettine said Johnny Manziel will \"more than likely\" back up starting quarterback Josh McCown. Manziel could be disciplined by the league after he was questioned by police last week for an in-car argument with his girlfriend, who told authorities he hit her during their quarrel. \nWashington: Police say four people invaded and robbed the L.A.-area home of receiver DeSean Jackson early Wednesday morning. Officer Aareon Jefferson says five people were home, but Jackson was with the rest of the team in Virginia. \nCowboys: Dez Bryant didn't travel with the team to New York, making it less likely the All-Pro receiver will return from a broken right foot against the Giants on Sunday. Bryant broke his foot in the opener, also against the Giants. \nTitans: Rookie Marcus Mariota will not play Sunday against Atlanta as he recovers from a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee. Zach Mettenberger will start at quarterback. Advertisement \nSteelers: The team left open the possibility quarterback Ben Roethlisberger could return to action after a three-game absence Sunday for its game at Kansas City. Roethlisberger was listed as questionable after being a limited participant in practice for a third straight day. He has been out since straining the medial collateral ligament in his left knee Sept. 27 in a win at St. Louis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:47:17.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
