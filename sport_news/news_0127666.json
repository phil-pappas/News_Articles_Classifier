The first time? When the Panthers advanced to the Super Bowl in 2003.\n\"I always thought if we could do it one at a time ... I knew we'd have a chance to win,\" Panthers coach Ron Rivera said.\nThe offense was buoyed by the hard running of Jonathan Stewart and hands of Olsen as Cam Newton suffered through a two-interception day.\nSeattle tight end Jimmy Graham lit up the Panthers' secondary for 140 yards for his biggest game of the season after weeks of light use as Seattle (2-4) tried to figure out how to work him into its offense.\n(c)2015 The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, N.C.)\nVisit The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, N.C.) at www.charlotteobserver.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739834", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739834&h=Greg+Olsen+TD+gives+Carolina+a+27%2D23+victory+over+Seattle", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739834&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:43:12.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
