Gould broke in for a 2-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter as well. \n“I knew they were going to be good,” Lebo head coach Troy McArthur said. “I thought we’d be able to come out and compete and make it a heck of a lot better game than that with the possibility of coming away with a win, but it just wasn’t going for us tonight.” \nLebo quarterback Drew Ott went 14 of 32 for 124 yards for the Wolves, who fell to 3-5 and 2-2 in district play. Lebo, which takes on Peabody-Burns next week, still holds an outside chance at the playoffs if it wins next week. \nLebo 6 0 0 8 — 14 \nRural Vista 8 14 14 14 — 50", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:36:02.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
