That will give more importance to the Premier 12, a tournament Fraccari devised for the top-12 ranked nations. \nThe first edition of the Premier 12 will be held in Japan and Taiwan next month. \nFraccari is still holding out hope that his original Olympic proposal of eight teams can be revived. \n\"There's still a chance, depending on the number of athletes,\" he said. \nA combined baseball-softball bid was among five additional sports recommended last month by Tokyo organizers. Karate, surfing, skateboarding and sports climbing were the others. \nThe International Olympic Committee will make a final decision in August. \nThe IOC voted in 2005 to remove baseball and softball after the 2008 Beijing Games. As separate bids, the two sports failed to return for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. \nBaseball and softball merged into a single confederation two years ago. \n___ \nAndrew Dampf can be followed at www.twitter.com/asdampf More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:03:34.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
