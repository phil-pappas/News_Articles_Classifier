He went up and grabbed it at the high point and made a play for us,” Hobart coach Mike Cragg said. \n“I told them during the timeout before the touchdown that we would go for two. We ran an empty with a slip and I thought (RPI) played good defense. The offense moved the ball all the way down there, I thought that they deserved the chance to earn it. If I had to do it over again, I would do it the same. Put the ball in Shane Sweeney’s hands and let him try to win the game for me.” \nThe final play brought the curtain down on a wild second half. \nTrailing by seven at halftime, Hobart (4-3, 2-2) dialed up an impressive drive to open the third quarter. \nSweeney (16-of-34 for 234 yards) converted a fourth down and 14 at the RPI 25-yard line with a 20-yard pass to Jack Pfohl to keep the drive alive. Tynard Barfield ran in from a yard out to cap a 15-play drive that took 9:24 off the clock and tied the game at 14. \nHobart failed on a fourth down and five to start the fourth quarter. It gave the Engineers (6-2, 4-1) the ball at the Statesmen 38-yard line. Quarterback Jeff Avery (16-of-25, 160 yards) moved RPI down the field, finally tossing a six-yard touchdown pass to Pat Hogan for a 21-14 lead with 10:46 to play. \nHobart’s next two possessions of the fourth were stopped on downs by the RPI defense; the first drive reached the Engineers’ 27-yard line. \nRPI got the ball back with 59 seconds left, but Tommy D’Antonio gave Hobart one last chance when he forced a fumble that the Statesmen recovered with 34 seconds remaining. \nSweeney hit Brandon Shed (8 receptions for 128 yards) for a 39-yard reception down to the RPI 21-yard line with 11 seconds left. \nOn the game’s last play with a second to go, Sweeney lofted a jump ball for Withers, who snatched the touchdown to precede the dramatic two-point conversion try that went for naught. \n“I don’t think our pass rush or pass coverage was good enough,” Cragg remarked. “I don’t think we ran the ball as well as we could have today. I loved the heart and fight and character the team showed coming back, but I hate losing worse.” \nThe Engineers’ high-powered passing attack, ranked second in the Liberty League, scored the first touchdown on Avery’s six-yard pass to Hogan. Avery keyed the drive with a 41-yard completion to Logan Gadder down to the Hobart nine. \nThe Statesmen answered right back with a seven-play, 63-yard drive, finished off by an 18-yard touchdown toss from Sweeney to a wide open Joseph Barrocas. \nRPI went back up late in the first half. Avery connected on another key pass to Gadder (19) yards that helped set up a deflected four-yard touchdown pass to Matt Lane with 1:07 left, giving the Engineers a 14-7 halftime lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:45:47.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
