(AP) -- Ben's Duchess went five-wide turning for home and went on to a 3 1/4-length victory in the $100,000 LA Woman Stakes for fillies and mares Sunday at Santa Anita.\nRidden by Joe Talamo, Ben's Duchess ran six furlongs in 1:15.79 and paid $19.60, $8 and $3.20 at 8-1 odds. It was the 3-year-old filly's first graded stakes victory.\nUzziel returned $5.40 and $2.40, while 3-5 favorite Taris was another half-length back in third and paid $2.10 to show in the Grade 3 race.\nThe victory, worth $60,000, increased Ben's Duchess' career earnings to $222,936, with four wins in nine starts for trainer John Sadler.\n''I was smiling as I saw the race play out in front of me,'' said Talamo, just back from New York, where he won the Grade 2 Kelso at Belmont with Appealing Tale on Saturday. ''I kept her back and to the outside because the kickback was a little heavy. I came into the turn and I had so much horse.''\nSports & Recreation Horse Racing Joe Talamo   585/56818   518/85227   28/4545  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:54:07.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
