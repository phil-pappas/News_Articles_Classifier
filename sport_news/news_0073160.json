The Volunteers also have experienced the other side of comebacks. They had dropped three of four, blowing two-touchdown leads in each of their losses.\n“They had a different look,” Tennessee coach Butch Jones said. “This football team was not going to be denied. They were going to find a way to win the football game. I’m just happy for them because they deserve to have this feeling.”\nThe defeat was doubly painful for Georgia (4-2, 1-2 SEC), which lost star running back Nick Chubb to an injured left knee on the first offensive play. Coach Mark Richt was unsure after the game about the severity of Chubb’s injury but the back looked to be in a lot of pain when being treated by trainers.\n“As of right now we’re still pretty hopeful that it won’t require surgery, but we’re not 100 percent sure of that,” Richt said.\nGeorgia’s Reggie Davis scored on a 70-yard punt return and 48-yard catch but dropped a potential game-tying 56-yard touchdown pass with less than four minutes left. The Bulldogs drove from their own 1-yard line to Tennessee’s 27 in their final possession, but Brian Randolph broke up Greyson Lambert’s pass to Malcolm Mitchell in the right corner of the end zone as time expired.\nDobbs was 25 of 42 with three touchdown passes for Tennessee (3-3, 1-2). He ran for two more, including a 5-yarder that broke a 31-all tie with 5:48 left.\nDobbs is the only Tennessee player ever to throw for 300 yards and run for 100 yards in the same game. He also did it last year in a 45-42 overtime victory at South Carolina.\n“We know football is a crazy game,” Dobbs said. “Anything can happen, and we had that mind-set all day. … We did a great job of perseverance, and we kept fighting.”\nTennessee trailed 24-3 late in the first half before rallying to beat a ranked team for just the second time in its last 30 tries. The Vols also ended a five-game losing streak in this annual series.\nIt also was the third-largest deficit Tennessee had ever overcome in a victory. The Vols beat Vanderbilt 38-36 in 1987 after trailing 28-3 and won 35-34 at Notre Dame in 1991 after falling behind 31-7.\n“The group of guys that we’ve got in our locker room is like no other,” Tennessee linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin said. “How tight we are and just how much we’re willing to fight for each other is something you really just can’t describe. We’re such a close team. When we hear all the outside distractions, we nip it in the bud.”\nGeorgia’s Sony Michel rushed for a career-high 145 yards, 124 of them coming before halftime. Lambert was 15 of 32 for 279 yards.\nThe Bulldogs grabbed an early lead on Leonard Floyd’s 96-yard return of a Jalen Hurd fumble and owned the 21-point advantage late in the first half before Tennessee came storming back.\nThe Vols got back into the game when Dobbs found Josh Smith for a 39-yard touchdown on a fourth-and-8 play. Michel fumbled away the ensuing kickoff at the Georgia 25, setting up a Dobbs 2-yard pass to Kamara that made it 24-17 at halftime.\n“I feel like we lost the game because of me,” Michel sad. “I wasn’t holding onto the ball tight enough. I just gave it away and (it) took away momentum.”\nTennessee continued its comeback in the second half even as injuries forced the Vols to start freshmen Jack Jones and Chance Hall on the right side of their offensive line.\n“This is a true testament of will, of resiliency and perseverance,” Jones said.\nNo. 2 Texas Christian 52, (at) Kansas State 45: Trevone Boykin threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns, the second a 55-yard strike to Josh Doctson with 1:10 left, and second-ranked TCU rallied from a big halftime deficit. Boykin also ran for 124 yards and two scores for the Horned Frogs (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who trailed 35-17 at the break. Aaron Green added 124 yards and two touchdowns rushing, while Doctson caught eight passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns.\nNone was bigger than his catch-and-run just 30 seconds after Jack Cantele had connected on a 37-yard field goal for Kansas State (3-2, 0-2) to knot the game 45-all.\nThe Wildcats had won 49 straight games when leading at halftime before last week’s loss at Oklahoma State. Now, coach Bill Snyder’s crew has lost two in a row.\nNo. 3 Baylor 66, (at) Kansas 7: Seth Russell tossed three touchdown passes, and Shock Linwood ran for 135 yards and a score. Russell threw for 246 yards, all in the first half. Two of the TD strikes went to Corey Coleman, pushing his nation-leading total to 13, and the other to 6-foot-7, 410-pound tight end LaQuan McGowan, helping the Bears (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) to a 52-7 halftime lead.\nIt was the seventh straight Big 12 win for the Bears, and one that was hardly unexpected: They began the game as 46-point favorites, a record for a visiting team in Big 12 play.\nTurns out the oddsmakers were being kind.\nFreshman Ryan Willis threw for 158 yards and a score in his first start for Kansas (0-5, 0-2), but he also tossed a pick and lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown.\n(At) No. 6 Clemson 43, Georgia Tech 24: Deshaun Watson threw for two touchdowns, and Wayne Gallman ran for two scores. On the same soggy field where the Tigers (5-0, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) outlasted the 15th-ranked Irish 24-22 last week, they made quick work of the Yellow Jackets (2-4, 0-3), who lost four straight for the first time since 1996.\nGallman ran for 115 yards, including a 66-yard touchdown run on the game’s third play, and Clemson’s rout was on.\nWatson passed for 265 yards, his highest total this season, and had touchdown throws of 29 and 8 yards to tight end Jordan Leggett.\nClemson’s defense held the Yellow Jackets to 71 yards rushing — its lowest total in coach Paul Johnson’s eight seasons.\n(At) No. 7 LSU 45, South Carolina 24: Leonard Fournette ran 87 yards for a touchdown, and Brandon Harris passed for a career-best 228 in a game moved to Tiger Stadium because of catastrophic flooding in the Gamecocks’ home state.\nFournette finished with a season-low 158 yards on 20 carries in three quarters. Freshman Derrius Guice rushed for 161 yards and a TD, while fellow running back Darrel Williams scored twice as the Tigers (5-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) piled up 396 yards rushing.\nTravin Dural had 109 yards receiving for LSU, highlighted by his 62-yard TD. Malachi Dupre also had a touchdown catch.\nWith quarterback Lorenzo Nunez nursing a sore shoulder, Perry Orth started for South Carolina (2-4, 0-4). He passed for 200 yards and two TDs against one interception. Rashad Fenton returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown.\n(At) No. 8 Alabama 27, Arkansas 14: Calvin Ridley caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from Jake Coker and No. 8 Alabama rode its swarming defense to a win. Stymied by early mistakes, the Crimson Tide (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) scored 24 points over the final 17 minutes after trailing at halftime. The Razorbacks (2-4, 1-2) couldn’t do more than flirt with the upset despite two Alabama interceptions and a pair of missed field goals.\nThe Tide held Alex Collins to 26 rushing yards and added three sacks and an interception.\nCoker was twice intercepted on deep balls in the first half but finished 24 of 33 for 262 yards with a pair of touchdowns. Derrick Henry ran for 95 yards on 27 carries and set an Alabama record late with a touchdown in his 11th consecutive game.\nReggie Ragland had a sack, two quarterback hurries and a forced fumble.\nNo. 11 Florida 21, (at) Missouri 3: Kelvin Taylor rushed for 99 yards and two first-quarter touchdowns and the Gators (6-0, 4-0 SEC) amassed 337 yards and possessed the ball for 37:53, converting 23 first downs.\nQuarterback Will Grier targeted eight receivers, completing 20 of 33 passes for 208 yards in his fifth start. Demarcus Robinson led Florida in receiving with six catches for 79 yards.\nFlorida’s defense never allowed Missouri’s offense to settle into a rhythm. Missouri was 1 of 13 on third downs and opened the second half with three consecutive three-and-outs.\nDrew Lock made his second start for Missouri (4-2, 1-2) in place of Maty Mauk, who is suspended indefinitely for violating team policy. He completed 16 of 39 passes for 151 yards, but threw two interceptions, one of which was returned by Jalen Tabor for a 40-yard touchdown.\n(At) No. 12 Florida State 29, Miami 24: Dalvin Cook ran for 222 yards and three touchdowns, the last a 23-yarder with 6:44 remaining. Florida State won despite Miami’s Brad Kaaya throwing for 405 yards and three touchdowns.\nThe Seminoles (5-0, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) have a six-game winning streak over the Hurricanes (3-2, 0-1), their longest winning streak in the series since winning seven straight from 1963-72.\nCook, whose status most of the week was in doubt because of a strained hamstring, is the first Seminoles back with two 200-yard games in a season since Greg Allen in 1981. Cook had 22 carries.\nEverett Golson completed 25 of 33 passes for 291 yards and a touchdown.\n(At) No. 14 Mississippi 52, New Mexico State 3: Chad Kelly threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns. Kelly, who came into the day leading the Southeastern Conference in passing, has topped 300 yards in four of his six games. He completed 24 of 33 throws.\nLaquon Treadwell caught eight passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns, including one on a spectacular one-handed grab down the right sideline.\nThe Rebels (5-1) finished with 665 yards of total offense. Eugene Brazley ran for a team-high 98 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown.\nNew Mexico State (0-5) couldn’t convert a few good opportunities after Ole Miss turnovers. The Aggies missed on two field goal attempts. The Aggies’ Nick Jeanty completed 11 of 22 passes for 74 yards.\nNo. 21 Oklahoma State 33, (at) West Virginia 26 (OT): Backup quarterback J.W. Walsh scored on a 2-yard run in overtime and Oklahoma State held West Virginia scoreless on its possession in the extra period. It marked the third straight close finish for the Cowboys (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who won their two previous conference games on last-minute field goals.\nSkyler Howard brought West Virginia from 15 points down with a 3-yard scoring run with 2:44 left to send the game into overtime tied at 26.\nOklahoma State’s running game was ineffective in regulation, but five straight rushes in overtime moved the ball to the 2, and Walsh took it in from there.\nWest Virginia (3-2, 0-2) advanced to the 4 on its overtime possession, but Howard threw incomplete in the end zone on fourth-and-goal.\n(At) No. 24 Toledo 38, Kent State 7: Terry Swanson ran for 161 yards and a touchdown and Kareem Hunt had two scores. Toledo got off to a shaky start, but remained undefeated at 5-0, 2-0 in the Mid-American Conference. Kent State is 2-4, 1-1.\nThe Rockets’ Diontae Johnson took the opening kickoff 89 yards for an apparent score, but the play was nullified by a penalty. After a three-and-out, Toledo’s fourth-down snap sailed through the end zone and Kent State recovered for its only points of the day.\nToledo took over from there, and led 24-7 at the half, with Swanson and Hunt leading the charge. Swanson carried 16 times, while Hunt had 16 carries for 85 yards. Rockets quarterback Phillip Ely was 19 for 32 for 205 yards and two touchdowns.\nNo. 25 Boise State 41, (at) Colorado State 10: Thomas Sperbeck caught two long touchdown passes and sophomore Jeremy McNichols scored his 13th and 14th TDs of the season. Among Brett Rypien’s 339 yards passing was a beautiful 85-yard TD to McNichols, who also caught a 53-yard touchdown pass from fellow wide receiver Shane Williams-Rhodes on a trick play.\nMcNichols, who leads the FBS in TDs, scored on a 56-yard scamper but was knocked from the game on a 1-yard TD run late in the third quarter and didn’t return.\nThe Broncos (5-1, 2-0 Mountain West) jumped out to a quick 17-0 lead before the Rams (2-4, 0-2) had even moved the chains and Boise State was never seriously threatened in celebrating its return to the rankings by thrashing Colorado State for the sixth straight time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:05:58.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
