LaCloche said the city will likely end its relationship with the company when a website redesign is launched.\nAttackers exploited the vulnerability to upload a file to the city's website that was disguised as a photo file, according to the police report.\nThat fake photo file was actually filled with nefarious code that opened the floodgates starting at 6 a.m. on Oct. 2, 2012, according to the report.\nThe city's computer systems were not shut down until 8 p.m. on Oct. 3, 2012, according to the police report.\nThe Naperville City Council met that night, but archive footage shows no mention of the incident, although cybersecurity for the city's smart grid initiative was discussed.\nOnce in the system, the hackers installed other undetectable programs and used an IT employee's credentials to open documents and obtain the login and password information of 59 employees, the report states.\nA computer at a fire station, as well as one in the office of the city's IT manager, were accessed remotely using those other programs to steal the credentials, according to the report.\nCity Manager Doug Krieger said in September that there was no evidence that personal information, such as Social Security numbers, were taken.\n\"Naperville employees were contacted to change their passwords on any and all other accounts if in fact they used the same passwords in their personal Internet accounts,\" the police report states.\nBased on the police report's narrative, Miller said it sounds like the attackers were operating with \"more than a low level of sophistication.\"\n\"This wasn't the first time they had done this,\" he said.\nDespite the details contained in the police report, just who attacked Naperville, or why, remains unclear.\nIt could have been someone specifically targeting Naperville, Miller said, or it may have been someone just scanning for that particular software vulnerability and the opening it offered\n\"It's not very possible to say, based on the amount of detail here,\" he said.\nSoftware vulnerabilities are remedied by manufacturer-issued software patches that fix bugs that had gone undiscovered.\nSuch patches are installed, for example, when your computer prompts you to restart for updates.\nDespite the ubiquity of these updates, Miller said they often go unheeded.\n\"It is extremely common for stuff like this to go unpatched,\" Miller said. \"It's kind of hard to understand at first…from the perspective of an average computer user. I just click the button and restart.\"\nBut some large organizations have lots of different software engaged throughout their network, he said, and a balance must be struck between a system's priorities and vulnerabilities.\n\"A lot of people don't prioritize updating Web server software,\" Miller said. \"For that reason, it's extremely simple using scanning tools to identify thousands of vulnerable servers that are running popular content management systems.\"\nAfter the intrusion was detected, the city's IT staff contacted N-Dimension, a company that consulted with Naperville on smart grid security, the report states.\nN-Dimension in turn contacted their incident response cohorts, Science Applications International Corporation, who told the IT department to shut down the city's systems until their investigators arrived, according to the report.\nThe attack was traced to a regional Internet registry in The Netherlands, the report states, \"where the proxy server was located.\"\nProxy servers are a way for Internet users to mask their physical location.\n\"They don't want whoever is looking at the issue to know where they're coming from,\" Miller said. \"You can very easily purchase Web hosting and set up your Web proxy there.\"\nThe police report states that the FBI was called in to investigate the attack.\nA Freedom of Information request with the bureau for any related investigations remains pending.\nNaperville police turned the investigation over to the FBI, and local law enforcement's role ceased on Nov. 15, 2012, according to the report.\nThe attack caused Naperville to beef up its defenses against future intrusions, and the threat of future hacks has not diminished.\nKrieger said earlier this year that the city's system is targeted half a million times each day.\nWhen refusing to release any records regarding Naperville's cybersecurity, Krieger said the city had specifically asked its consultants to not draft any reports, so they would not be discoverable in legal cases.\nThe cost of the emergency response 11 days after the attack began on Oct. 2, 2012, was $50,000, according to the police report.\n\"This does not include the amount of time and effort that was lost for City of Naperville services due to the Naperville servers being taken down,\" the report states.\nGeoffz@tribpub.com\nTwitter @JournoGeoffZ\nCopyright © 2015, Naperville Sun Cyber Crime Naperville", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562b970f/turbine/ct-nvs-naperville-computer-hack-st-1025-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:30:12.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
