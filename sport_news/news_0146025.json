Last Wednesday, the Eagles swam to victory in an 86-82 final over Bunnell of Stratford. \nSenior captains Alyssa Paladino, Kelly Scianna and Haley McNulty have been paving the way, along with classmates Julia Streeter, Sara Beck, Maria Finitsis, Jennifer Rondinelli, Jessica Schreiber and Nadia Watt. \n“Our seniors, especially our captains bring experience to a young team,” said Paolini. “Our freshman class is made up of six girls, who all have been making an impact.” \nFreshman diver Christina Gleason has already posted a score of 175, giving the Eagles an added scoring threat. Freshman Bella Carroll and Julie Myers have already earned victories, with freshman Cali Jolley, Mary Lonergan and Molly Sullivan looking to make their mark. \n“Bella and Julie are both very versatile and can swim in any event we need them to,” said Paolini. “That is so important when it comes to preparing for close meets. It’s nice to have such a young group making an impact.” \nLaw came out and jumped in front of Bunnell by winning the 200 medley relay with the foursome of McNulty, Hannah Savoie, Carroll and Margaret Sullivan posting a time of 2:18.66. \nMyers was a double winner making sure Law stayed out in front taking first in the 200 freestyle in 2:10.92 and winning the 500 freestyle with a blistering pace of 5:49.43. Carroll swam to victory in the 50 freestyle with a winning time of 29.30 and took second in the 100 butterfly. McNulty added another one-two finish taking first in the 100 backstroke at 1:18.92 and took second in the 100 freestyle. \nStreeter swam to a first-place finish in the 100 butterfly with an effort of 1:19.49. Law picked up some valuable points with Scianna taking second in the 200 IM and Nina Safyre finishing second in the 100 breaststroke. Cyntia Santos was third in the 200 IM and Haley Datillo finished third in 500 freestyle. \nThe Eagles have strong presence in the junior class with Arielle Eighmy, Samantha Markham, Madison Murphy and Alexandra Remy, along with Isabela Roldan, Maeve Rourke, Madison Sosa, Olivia Tramuta and Abigail Williamson adding experience to the lineup. \nLaw has some well rounded depth with sophomores Emma Caserta, Victoria Maher and Pamela Olmos adding to the mix. \nLast Friday, Law ran into a tough Hamden squad and came up on the short end of a 97-80 final margin. Savoie led the way as a double-winner, taking first in the 200 freestyle at 2:12.60 and the 500 freestyle in a time of 5:48.65. \nScianna swam to victory in the 100 backstroke in 1:13.22 and Safyre won the 100 breaststroke in a time of 1:34.70. the 400 relay team of Carroll, Savoie, McNulty and Scianna took first with an effort of 4:29.12. \nThe Eagles will be on the road on Friday going up against Sheehan.
