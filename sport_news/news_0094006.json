Silva scored his third goal of the season in the 11th minute with a header from close range from Guido Carrillo's cross.\nCarillo hit the woodwork twice in the first half and Reims keeper Johny Placide made a good save to deny Nabil Dirar's 20-meter effort in the 66th minute.\nReims was reduced to ten men two minutes later after Antoine Devaux was sent off for a second yellow card.\nThe hosts played better following Devaux's dismissal and their best chance came in added time when Jordan Siebatcheu fired a low shot onto Danijel Subasic's post.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
