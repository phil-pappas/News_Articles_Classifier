According to UGA Senior Associate Athletic Director for Sports Medicine Ron Courson, the injury involves damage to multiple ligaments and cartilage; however, the damage does not include the ACL. Neither does the injury involve arteries or nerves. \nCourson said all the damage is repairable and a full recovery is expected following surgery and rehab. Chubb is currently in the hospital for observation and surgery would be expected sometime in the next two weeks. \nChubb entered Saturday's contest having rushed for 100 yards or more for 13 consecutive games, surpassing Heisman winner Herschel Walkers previous school record. He ranks second in the SEC this season with 745 rushing yards. \nCopyright 2015 WTOC. All rights reserved.
