I can't wait to just get back in there and get on a winning track and do what I do best. \n\"I know that I'm just very, very happy with my chance to get back in. It's very exciting. \n\"It's my first fight on pay-per-view, so it's a whole new audience, and I know that my abilities are yet again just tested at the utmost, top level of athletes, and I'm excited for that. I know that my abilities are just going to come through. I have a lot to prove to myself this fight, more than I ever have, and I'm excited for that.\" \nAfter fighting Tate, Eye went right back into training, but not before she studied film in order to learn from the loss. \n\"I made a very tiny mistake that changed the direction of the fight, and that is very easily changed, and I'm very excited that I'm able to come into this fight and change that and kind of get this sour taste out of my mouth, and I know that I can just use what I most recently had to be able to make changes, and I'm excited for it. I feel very, very confident and good about myself,\" Eye said. \n\"Basically, it was stopping. I was really doing an amazing job the first four minutes and 15 seconds. I connected with 28 strikes to her four, and I stopped my movement and hesitated. I hesitated on myself, and that's not something I usually do, so I'm excited to never hesitate again.\" \nOnce Eye got back into training camp for her fight with Pena, one thing became very evident to the 29-year old fighter: she was in a much different place than at any other point in her professional career. \n\"This camp has been better than the Miesha (one), better than any camp I've ever had,\" Eye said. \"I can honestly say the Miesha camp was good, but I think there was a lot of emotion going into it, whereas this one, it's just been different. \n\"It's hard to understand and relate it to words for people to know, but there's just something I can't explain about myself, and I'm just excited to get out there and fight. The weight cut's been easy. I'm in no danger or anything, or any moment where I feel like I'm not eating or drinking. That's something that is super important as you go into some of these fights, and I feel great. I feel really, really good.\" \nHeading into her fight with Pena, who is 2-0 in her brief UFC career, Eye is out to show the division that despite the loss to Tate, she is very much a contender and someone to be reckoned with in the women's bantamweight division. \n\"You know what, she's super tough and extremely strong,\" Eye said. \"And I'm super excited to go up against someone like that because I think it's only going to bring out the better in me, but I definitely know she's just as hungry as I am, and I can't wait to show her that my experience is really going to hold true on this.\" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RnIvD9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:32:27.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
