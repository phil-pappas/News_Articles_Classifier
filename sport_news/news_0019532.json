Hey, remember when Danny Amendola was viewed as Welker’s replacement? On the other hand, there’s the case of Aaron Dobson, the third-year wide receiver who was inactive for Sunday’s 30-6 win at Dallas. Not that that was anything new. Dobson is often inactive for games in which he plays. Seven receptions for 87 yards in the Patriots’ 40-32 win at Buffalo in Week 2 broke out the talk that what we’d witnessed was a breakout game for the 2013 second-round draft pick, but he’s disappeared from view once again. Beyond that, Dobson’s body of work this season consists of one catch for 9 yards in the Patriots’ 28-21 season-opening victory over Pittsburgh and one reception for 5 yards (although he also drew a 52-yard pass interference penalty on a long ball he should have caught but dropped) in the team’s 51-17 shellacking of Jacksonville in Week 3. Compare and contrast Dobson and Jamie Collins. Also selected in the second round of the 2013 draft, just seven picks ahead of Dobson, in Collins we are watching the game’s next great linebacker develop right before our eyes. “Dude’s not human,” safety Devin McCourty said after Collins turned in a 10-tackle performance and forced a fumble in Sunday’s win over the Cowboys. The 2015 Patriots have scored 149 points, a franchise record through the first four games of a season. Since you’re asking, the 2007 Patriots were at 148 points and counting through four games, en route to putting up what was then an NFL-record 589 points in a season. As a footnote to that, with 47 points, place-kicker Stephen Gostkowski is on pace to score 188 points this year, which would top the league-record 186 points in a season LaDainian Tomlinson put on the board as a running back while scoring 31 touchdowns with the San Diego Chargers in 2006. And with 1,387 yards passing, quarterback Tom Brady is on pace to throw for 5,548 yards, which would surpass Peyton Manning’s league-record 5,477 yards with the Denver Broncos in 2013. Quick, name the Patriot who has the team’s only kickoff return this year. Why, it’s tight end Michael Williams, of course, who returned a kickoff by ex-Steeler Josh Scobee 8 yards from his 13 to the 21 in the fourth quarter of the season opener. Page 2 of 2 - “Our kickoff return, we really haven’t had a chance to return a kickoff all year, you know, a legitimate one,” head coach Bill Belichick noted Tuesday. Speaking of Williams, while I realize it was for blocking purposes, I still find it somewhat disconcerting that the converted offensive tackle, whom the Patriots acquired in a late-August trade with Detroit, was on the field for twice as many plays (20-10) as Scott Chandler, the free agent whom they handed a two-year, $5.3 million contract in March. So much for the talk that the 6-foot-7 Chandler would come into New England and form a set of twin towers in tandem with Rob Gronkowski. Gronkowski (20 receptions for 375 yards and four TDs) has done his part; Chandler (six receptions for 49 yards and one TD) has been missing in action. On the other side of the ball, it sure hasn’t taken another free-agent pickup, Jabaal Sheard (four sacks in four games), long to make himself at home. This 4-0 start is the eighth in Patriots history (1964, 1974, 1997, 1999, 2004, 2007 and 2013). The team has reached 5-0 just three times (1974, 2004 and, of course, 2007).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:25:40.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
