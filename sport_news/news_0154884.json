Rangers open in fine style 1  /  1 Back to Gallery Chicago \nOscar Lindberg , Kevin Klein and Derek Stepan scored in the first period, and the New York Rangers ruined Chicago's Stanley Cup party with a 3-2 victory over the Blackhawks on Wednesday on the first night of the NHL season.\nJ.T. Miller had two assists and Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves for New York, which begins the year with title aspirations of its own. The Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy last season for the most points in the NHL, and then lost to Tampa Bay in seven games in the Eastern Conference final.\nCheered on by a sellout crowd of 22,104, with many dressed in their usual red jerseys, the Blackhawks raised the banner for the franchise's sixth NHL title during a colorful pregame ceremony. Fluorescent balls bounced around the seats and LED wristbands for the fans provided a synchronized lightshow during player introductions and highlight presentations.\nAll-Star winger Patrick Kane , the subject of a sexual assault investigation in western New York, heard loud cheers when he skated onto the ice for the Cup celebration. Kane has not been charged, and has said he expects to be exonerated.\nArtemi Panarin scored in his first NHL game for Chicago, which is trying to become the first team to successfully defend the title since the Detroit Red The Wings in 1997-98. Teuvo Teravainen also scored, and Corey Crawford made 24 stops.\nCanadiens 3, Leafs 1: Carey Price made 36 saves and Montreal beat Toronto in the season opener, spoiling Mike Babcock 's coaching debut with the Maple Leafs. Canadiens captain Max Pacioretty scored on Montreal's first shot against Jonathan Bernier a few minutes in for the first goal of the NHL season. Alex Galchenyuk broke a tie midway through the third period, and Pacioretty added an empty-netter. James van Riemsdyk had a power-play goal for Toronto early in the second period. Bernier finished with 27 saves. Babcock made the first coach's challenge in NHL history and was successful in overturning a goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:30:15.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
