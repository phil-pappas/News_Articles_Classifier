Pleasant News \nPACKWOOD — The WACO football team hosted district co-leader Pekin on Friday night in a game with serious playoff implications. The Warriors played tough with the Panthers, outscoring them in two of the four quarters, but a 28-point Pekin third was too much to overcome in a 49-32 loss. \nThe Warriors, who came into the game 3-2 in the conference, had to battle back early from a 14-0 deficit after a couple of 70-yard touchdown passes found the end zone for Pekin in the first two quarters. \nTrailing by 14 points in the second quarter, Jorge Chacon caught a 48-yard pass from Jackson Roth to cut the lead to 14-7. Then, later in the quarter, Colton Horak hit a 27-yard field goal that made it 14-10 going into halftime. \nThings began to unravel for the Warriors in the third. Three rushing touchdowns and a pick-six bumped the Panthers’ lead to 42-10 and the WACO offense couldn’t put up any points in the period to keep things close. \nIn the fourth, Duncan Pickard cut the lead with a four-yard rushing touchdown, but Pekin responded with a score of their own to make it 49-18. Late in the fourth, Bryce Achen found the end zone for the first time with a 49-yard run and Chacon caught a pass from Justyn Chalupa, but time ran out on the Warriors, who fell by 17. \nAchen had another monster day on the ground for WACO. The senior running back rushed for 237 yards and one touchdown on 37 attempts. Roth was 8-18 for 118 yards, one touchdown and one interception to lead the Warriors in passing. Chalupa’s 20-yard touchdown pass was his only attempt. \nChacon only had two catches on the day, but they were both for touchdowns. He finished with 68 yards on the day and two scores. Horak caught three balls for 32 yards, Jackson Gerot caught three passes for 31 yards and Chalupa had one reception for seven yards. \nThe defense was led by Jason Sammons, who had six tackles on the day. Gerot had 5.5, and Horak Cody Crawford each had four. The Warriors had two takeaways in the game. Achen and Hunter Leichty each had a fumble recovery. \nThe Warriors (3-5 overall, 3-3 in district play) are currently tied in fourth place with New London in Class A District 6. WACO currently holds the tiebreaker over the Tigers, but they’re not guaranteed a playoff spot with a win over Danville (2-6, 2-4) next week, although a win combined with a New London loss would automatically earn them a spot. \nBecause of three-way tiebreaker rules (point differential with 13-points being a max number), the Warriors would have to beat the Bears by at least a touchdown to guarantee a playoff spot. The reasoning is, if New London defeats Lone Tree, the Lions, Tigers and Warriors would be in a three-way tie for third. The team with the worst district point differential would be left out of the postseason. \nEven if the Warriors were to lose on Friday, however, they could still get in with a New London loss. In that scenario, WACO, New London and Danville would all be tied for fourth, and the team with the best point differential would get the fourth and final playoff spot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:57:51.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
