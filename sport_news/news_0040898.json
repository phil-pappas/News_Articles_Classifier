Cesar Chavez demolished after they said its tenants had not paid rent on time and had violated other aspects of their lease. Sergio and Monica Lejarazu, the tenants and owners of the piñata shop, said they had proof they had paid their bills on time and were being pressured to leave their store by French and Fisher even though they still had two years left on the lease.\nAfter the destruction of their store with their merchandise, medical and financial records still inside, the Lejarazus filed suit against their landowners in Travis County court.\nJay Janner Jumpolin pinata store owners Sergio Lejarazu, second from left, and Monica Lejarazu, their daughter Emilia Lejarazu, left, and supporter Susana Almanza, right, walk to the 345th Civil Distric Court at the Heman Sweatt Travis County Courthouse on Thursday September 24, 2015. JAY JANNER / AMERICAN-STATESMAN In March, District Judge Karin Crump granted a temporary injunction that prevented French and Fisher from continuing any demolition, construction or alteration to the premises until further notice.\nIn June, French and Fisher agreed to rent out 95 Navasota Street, the property adjoining the former piñata store lot, to a new business called the Blue Cat Café . The cafe owners told news outlets they planned to use the site of the piñata store as parking for their business.\nSince the new rental agreement was made, a trailer for the new café was placed on the property and new concrete, cinder blocks and a seating area have been added.\nThe Lejarazus’ lawyers argue the alterations are a violation of the existing injunction and called for a hearing to determine whether the landowners were in contempt of court.\nThe café is set to open Oct. 16. The court case against French and Fisher is set to be heard in December. Thursday’s hearing will deal only with whether the landowners have violated the injunction.\nIn September, lawyers for the defendants sent the Lejarazus a letter offering to relocate the trailer between the two properties and remove the newly poured concrete slab, cinder blocks and seating area in order to avoid the contempt hearing. They also offered to pay $1,750 in attorney’s fees to the Lejarazus, according to the letter.\nIn addition, the lawyers offered to pay the Lejarazus $25,000 to settle the entire case. A settlement would require a confidentiality agreement and the dismissal of the legal action against the defendants, the lawyers said in the offer letter.\nThe Lejarazus turned down the offer, which they said was less than the amount they would have had to pay for the two years remaining on their lease, calling it “an insult.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/07/43/0c/jwj-Jumpolin-0008.jpg", "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/cat-cafe-will-open-at-site-of-demolished-east-aust/nnFCs/"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:09:23.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
