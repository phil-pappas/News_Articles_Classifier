That opened up a slot for CHCA. \n\"I'll take luck every day of the week,\" Kudnar said. \nJunior Ty DeBonis earned medalist honors with a 38-33 – 77 to lead McNicholas to its second consecutive district championship. \n\"That was something,\" DeBonis said, crediting an adjustment in his putting halfway through the round for his blazing finish. \"That gave me a little more confidence. It really helped.\" \nRockets coach Justin Lenczicki was impressed that DeBonis shot 3-under par on the back nine. \n\"That's a testament to how hard he works,\" Lenczicki said. \"Anybody on the team will tell he's our hardest worker.\" \nMcNicholas edged Dayton Oakwood by two strokes. \n\"That was fun,\" Lenczicki said. \"It was a little stressful. We've been on a roll the last three weeks.\" \nFenwick junior Miles Jena, who qualified as an individual last season, shot a 38-35 – 73 to lead Division II individual qualifiers. Madeira sophomore Ethan Snyder, who's in his first season on the Mustangs team, overcame a 4-over par eight on his 14th hole to finish with a 35-41 – 76 and earn an individual berth. \n\"After that eight, I knew I had par out,\" Snyder said. \"I tried to clear everything out of my mind.\" \nSeven Hills junior Jack Lane earned the second Division III individual qualifying berth in a three-hole playoff. \nTwo Division III teams and two individuals not on qualifying teams reached the state tournament. \nThe state tournaments are scheduled for next Friday and Saturday. The Division II boys' tournament will be played on the North Star course in Sunbury while the Division III tournament is set for Ohio State University's Scarlet Course. \nThe Division II girls' tournament is scheduled to be played on OSU's Gray Course. Monroe junior Sammi Blackburn shot a 71 to qualfify for an indidivual berth in the state tournament and earn medalist honors in the district tournament on Wednesday at Pipestone Golf Course in Miamisburg. Seven Hills senior Alyssa Akiyama also qualified and finished second with a 73. \nThe Division I boys and girls district tournaments are scheduled to be played next Thursday at Weatherwax. Lakota East, Milford, defending state champion Moeller and Mason qualified on Tuesday out of the Glenview boys' sectional, while defending district champion St. Xavier, Elder, La Salle and Hamilton earned berths out of the Miami Whitewater sectional on Wednesday. \nGirls' teams moving on include Mason, St. Ursula and Mercy from the Walden Ponds sectional and Ursuline, Sycamore, Lakota West and Oak Hills out of the Hamilton Elks sectional.
