(AP) - New Hampshire's highway signs have long included the French word for welcome. But does the state back up that blink-and-you'll miss it message?\nFrench-speaking Canadian tourists are a key component of New Hampshire's tourism industry, but they spend more time and money in Maine and Vermont. Plymouth State University professor Katharine Harrington thinks that could change if New Hampshire businesses were more welcoming.\nShe trains students for a program called \"Bienvenue New Hampshire,\" which recently was awarded a $55,000 grant from the Northern Border Regional Commission.\nThe program offers marketing support, translation services, workshops and training videos to help the state's tourism industry better connect with French-speaking Canadian visitors. Meanwhile, students get real-world experience practicing their French skills.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
