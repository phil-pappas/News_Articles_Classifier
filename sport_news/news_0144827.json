(Photo: Otto Greule Jr., Getty Images) \nAllen Park — Say this much about the Bennett brothers. They’re funny.\nTwo weeks ago, after the Lions lost to the Seahawks, Seattle defensive lineman Michael Bennett decided to — tongue in cheek, we think — blame Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford for the death of President John F. Kennedy.\n“He’s from Dallas and Dallas, they killed the president,” he said. “It’s where JFK, one of the greatest presidents, died at, so I just have a little hatred toward him.\n“I hold that against him.”\nOuch.\nOn Wednesday, Bears tight end Martellus Bennett held a conference call with Detroit reporters, who were all too eager to ask him about his brother’s comments.\nThoughts?\n“He’s a (bleep),” Martellus Bennett said, cracking himself up.\nTo be clear, Michael, not Stafford, right?\n“Yeah, yeah,” Martellus Bennett said. “Both of them probably are, but I’m talking about my brother in that instance.\n“It’s funny. Mike is just a funny guy. Stafford probably wasn’t even born!”\nOf course he wasn’t.\nKennedy was killed in 1963; Stafford was born in 1988.\nThat didn’t stop Martellus Bennett from grabbing the ball and running with it.\nHe cut off the next question to play up the Stafford-JFK comments some more.\n“Could you see Matthew Stafford in a JFK video, just like making a cameo? Hey, what’s he doing? Why’s he there in the background throwing football or something when the car’s coming by? Oh, he’s just playing catch.\n“It’s Matthew Stafford’s fault!”\nThe Martellus Bennett comedy hour — or 7 minutes, 24 seconds, before Bears public-relations people decided to cut the call off — continued when asked about fellow tight end Eric Ebron.\nThe two met at Arizona in February for the Super Bowl, and had a brief chat.\nCare to share details of the conversation?\n“He had a mohawk with, like, blond hair. I was just like, ‘Man, that’s what the kids are doing nowadays?’ ” Martellus Bennett said. “Overall, just telling him to stay focused on the fundamentals and stay off the streets.\n“Ain’t nothing good happens after 11. If you can’t get a date before 11 o’clock, you need to go home and work on yourself.”\nSo, what time do you see Ebron?\n“It was about 11:15,” Martellus Bennett said, with another booming laugh.\ntpaul@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tonypaul1984", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:18:32.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
