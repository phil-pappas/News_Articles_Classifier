New York Giants linebacker Jon Beason is upset with Alex Boone of the San Francisco 49ers.\nAdChoices He says Boone shoved him into 49ers running back Carlos Hyde in Week 5 on the play in which he suffered a concussion.\n“ I can honestly say that, if I hadn’t got pushed in the back, I wouldn’t have been concussed,” Beason said, via James Kratch of NJ.com. “It’s unfortunate when another player – Alex Boone, to be exact – can reach back, grab you from behind and then deliberately push you in the back. It’s hard enough to stay healthy in this league. I think it was a coward move, it doesn’t show any sportsmanship, or regard for another player and their career.”\nAs he said, Beason sees what Boone did as a “coward move.”\nJon Beason is NOT happy with Alex Boone regarding this shove in the back. https://t.co/Bypri3IKQe #NYGiants\n— Sportsnaut (@Sportsnaut) October 16, 2015\nBoone’s shove certainly does appear to catch Beason off guard, and the impending collision caused a concussion, which knocked the linebacker out of the game.\nBeason further vented about his frustration with Boone. In addition to saying what he did was “a coward move,” he expressed a belief that Boone knew what he was doing, saying “it was clear the intent was there.”\n“He then reached out, horse collared me, and then pushed me. … It’s clear there was intent there. Not necessarily for harm, but you have to have some regard for other players in terms of the rules. That’s why the rules are created for a reason.”\nThankfully Beason is set to play on Monday when the Giants head into Philadelphia in a pivotal NFC East battle. He’s had trouble staying healthy throughout his career, so it’s especially nice to see him bounce back so quickly from this latest injury. That said, it doesn’t appear he’ll be sending the Boone household a Christmas card this year, if ever.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/10/giants_linebacker_jon_beason_blames_concussion_on.html", "https://t.co/Bypri3IKQe", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NYGiants?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Sportsnaut/status/655109959215026176", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:45:44.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
