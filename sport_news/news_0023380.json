The two meet regularly, but members of the Tuolumne County Superintendent of Schools Office and the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office are looking for more funding for school safety and wellness programs. The push comes after threats of violence at three local schools occurred within a week of each other. Four boys were arrested for Oct. 2 planning a mass shooting at Summerville High School, and death threats made at Sonora High and Soulsbyville Elementary schools were reported to law enforcement last week. Superintendent of Schools Margie Bulkin and Sheriff James Mele will ask for money to expand their agencies existing partnership at a meeting with the Sonora Area Foundation scheduled for later today. The foundation has funneled private donations and awarded grants to community groups since 1990. “The meeting will address extra measures of support we need in times of crisis,” said Bulkin. Bulkin was hesitant Monday to discuss details or the level of funding the county will ask for. Most likely it will come in the form of one-time funded items not currently offered to schools or law enforcement, Bulkin said. The county’s present collaboration between law enforcement and educators is based around what is referred to as “Ed-Law,” a series of semi-regular meetings — now held every other month — to discuss issues of safety ranging from truancy to active shooters and bullying trends. As an example, the Tuolumne County Narcotics Team will talk about drug abuse and enforcement at the next meeting. Attending parties include district superintendents, school principals, and members of Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office, Sonora Police Department, California Highway Patrol, Tuolumne County Probation Department and Tuolumne County District Attorney’s Office. “More than what we learn, we develop very strong working relationships,” Bulkin said. The Tuolumne County Board of Education took time at a trustees meeting Monday to acknowledge the partnership and invited Mele to speak. Mele addressed both the thwarted shooting and his work moving forward with Bulkin. Mele credited strength of the county’s education and law enforcement partnership to a trust that “trickled down” from leaders like himself and Bulkin to teachers and students. “I can come to Margie… I mean Superintendent of Schools Bulkin, say we have a problem, and have a very frank discussion,” Mele said. “Those conversations are important to have, those relationships are important to have, and I hate to say it this way, but (the incident at Summerville) is a great way to showcase this,” he said. As he has repeated over the last week, Mele applauded the actions of the students who reported the suspicious behavior to a teacher, the teacher’s quickness to go to administration, and administration’s work with the sheriff’s office. “I can’t say how proud I am of what happened that day,” Mele said. Trustee Cyndi Simonson, a mother of three Summerville High students thanked Mele for his presence at a school assembly the Monday following the arrests. “In a very eloquent and heartfelt way you put them to ease, and I thank you for that,” Simonson said. Her comments were echoed by trustee Juliana Feriani, who added, “It was almost a celebration of what didn’t happen because everybody did what they were supposed to do.” Mele thanked the trustees, but said he and school administration can always improve. “When you feel that there’s no room for improvement it’s time to step down,” he said. In reference his work with Bulkin, Mele said it is too premature to divulge specifics, but he wants to see more counselors and law enforcement on campuses, and efforts to do so will continue for many months. “As we give those children opportunities to have an array of professionals intervene into their lives we will be more successful,” Mele said. Immediately preceding Mele, Soulsbyville Elementary School Superintendent Jeff Winfield updated the board on projects in his district. He did not mention the Soulsbyville student reported Wednesday to law enforcement after threatening students on the bus and in the classroom. Winfield told The Union Democrat last week the report was a routine disciplinary measure. In addition to her meeting with Mele and the Sonora Area Foundation, Bulkin will meet with a number of community agencies this week that have reached out to support the growth and development of children in the community with “heighten interest” after the highly publicized violence on Tuolumne County campuses this month, said Bulkin. “I don’t want to act like this a new need,” Bulkin said. “We are drawing on a well established relationship to do extraordinary things for kids.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:10:59.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
