Misleading statistics sometimes are innocuous. But it’s no minor matter when the source of a statistic is such a respected agency as the FBI, and the figures in question purport to show how often violent crimes happen in Baker City. The FBI’s 2014 national report attributes 61 violent crimes — 56 of those aggravated assaults — in Baker City. That’s considerably more assaults than are listed for that year for La Grande (12) and Pendleton (15), and not that many fewer than the 75 that Bend, with 8 times Baker City’s population, had. Aggravated assault is either first- or second-degree assault, both of which are crimes in Oregon that carry mandatory minimum prison sentences of at least 70 months. Baker City Police Chief Wyn Lohner was unequivocal in his assessment of the FBI’s count of aggravated assault in the city in 2014: “Completely inaccurate.” Lohner noted that his department’s annual report for that year shows 11 aggravated assault cases, and of those no more than seven had enough evidence to warrant police even writing a report. Seven seems a much more plausible number, considering the figures for La Grande and Pendleton, neither of which, at least anecdotally, has a reputation as a vastly less violence place than Baker City. The source of the discrepancy between the city’s statistics and the FBI’s is not clear. The city gives its statistics to the county’s Consolidated Dispatch Center, which is the FBI’s source. The problem seems to be recent, at any rate — the FBI’s 2013 report lists 24 aggravated assaults for Baker City. Whatever its cause, the situation needs to be resolved. Baker City’s reputation, and quite possibly its attractiveness to people and businesses considering moving here, suffers if the FBI, without doubt the nation’s most famous law enforcement agency, posts on its public website reports that strongly imply Baker City is a much more dangerous place than cities of comparable size in Oregon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:14:35.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
