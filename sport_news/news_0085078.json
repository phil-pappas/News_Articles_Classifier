Eric Schierhorn made 30 saves for the Gophers and took the loss. \nFor the second straight night, the Gophers fell behind by two goals early. No.7 Minnesota Duluth's Dominic Toninato and Karson Kuhlman scored at 5:25 and 12:01 of the first period, respectively. Both goals came at even strength, though the period featured eight total penalties and five power-play opportunities. \nThe Bulldogs scored almost immediately to start the second period, too, as Jared Thomas came out of the penalty box to net a breakaway goal at the 1:10 mark. \nMinnesota had opportunities but couldn't convert. It was 0 for 7 on the power play and 3 for 3 on the penalty kill. \nThe Gophers play in a nonconference series at home against Northeastern on Oct. 23-24.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:48:57.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
