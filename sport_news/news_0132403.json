By avoiding disqualification, Rossi remains on 312 points before the Valencia GP, seven ahead of Lorenzo with 25 available for victory in Spain. \nThere was more drama on the podium as the pro-Rossi crowd booed Lorenzo when he picked up his second-place prize, with the Spaniard storming off immediately after the anthems and not waiting to pose for photographs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:13:17.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
