Now they just want to make the most of their state experience. \nAlong with Smoot and Cote, Free State’s doubles teams Caitlin and Ali Dodd, and Rachel Walters and Andrea Chen will begin play at state at 11:20 a.m. today at the CBAC in Olathe. \n“It’s really surreal to me, especially, that we made it,” Smoot said. “It seems like we’re just going to another tournament, like the season is just extended. But it’s weird to think that we’re top-24 in the state in doubles.” \nSmoot and Cote, making their first trips to state, took sixth place at their regional last week and own a 13-11 record this season. \nIt has been a long journey in the sport for Smoot, who only started working to improve her game last summer. \n“Initially, freshman year, I just did it because my friend didn’t want to try out alone,” Smoot said. “I actually got cut seventh-grade year from the tennis team. But she just didn’t want to try out alone, and I was, like, ‘Whatever.’ Now that I care, I really enjoy it and am really trying to get better.” \nDuring this week’s of practices, Smoot and Cote worked on the fundamentals. They’ve only started playing together as a doubles team this season and have saved some of their best tennis for the end of the year. \n“The more that we played, the more we learned about each other and about ourselves as players and about how to do well with other people,” Cote said. “I think the entirety of the season was a learning experience, and it really culminated at regionals. We kind of put everything we had and ended up doing well.” \nIt’s the third year Free State senior Rachel Walters will play at state — all with different doubles partners. She started playing with junior Andrea Chen in the middle of this season, and the two have combined for a 12-3 record this year. \nFSHS senior Caitlin Dodd and her sophomore sister, Ali, are back at state for the second straight year as a doubles tandem. They took second place at regionals last week and hope to medal after posting a 1-2 record at state last year. \n“Obviously, we just gained a lot of experience this past year,” Caitlin Dodd said, “so I think that’s really going to help us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:01:50.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
