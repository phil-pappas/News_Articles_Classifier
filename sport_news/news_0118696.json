(Michael Minasi/Conroe Courier via AP) Advertisement MLB: Astros squander lead, Royals win 9-6 By Joshua Koch jkoch@hcnonline.com Houston Community Newspapers \nHOUSTON - The Astros and their fans will have to put the champagne on ice for at least a few more days. \nIn a 41-minute eighth inning, which saw 11 Royals' batters come to the plate and five runs come in, Kansas City preserved its season sending the American League Divisional Series back to home with a 9-6 come-from-behind win on Monday. \n\"That was an unbelievable inning,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"I think we ended up seeing like 53 pitches in the 8th inning. I mean, that just shows you the quality at-bats that we had, at-bat after at-bat, after at-bat. So it was a great inning right there.\" \nThe Astros sent rookie Lance McCullers out for his first postseason start, and just like Dallas Keuchel he gave up early runs but settled in. \nMcCullers finished going 6.1 innings, giving up two runs on two hits, while striking out seven and walking two. McCullers leaving the game with his team leading 3-2 in the seventh. \n\"He came out of the game hot with a lot of adrenaline and a lot of intensity, which we would expect,\" Astros manager AJ Hinch said. \"I thought after the (Salvador) Perez homer, I thought it was nice to see him settle down and execute some pitches and get some big swings and misses.\" \nThe Astros continued their hot hitting in the bottom of the seventh and rookie Carlos Correa continuing to strengthen his case for Rookie of the Year. \nCorrea, who had already homered in the third and doubled in the fifth, cranked his second long ball of the day in the seventh, making it 5-2 Astros at the time. \nWith his two home runs, Correa became the first Astro to have a multi-home run game in the playoffs since Carlos Beltran in 2004 and the youngest player at 21 years and 20 days old in American League history to accomplish that feat. \nFollowing his act was the hot-hitting Colby Rasmus, who hit his fourth home run of the postseason, pushing the Astros lead up to 6-2. \nRasmus is batting .500 during the playoffs with a double, four home runs and six RBIs. \nThe fans were into it and the Astros were leading by four with six outs left to go for a trip to the American League Championship series. \nThen the eighth inning happened. \nThe Royals rattled off six-straight singles, driving in five runs, barreling through relievers Will Harris and Tony Sipp before Luke Gregerson came in allowing the final run. Kansas City was back up 7-6 and in control. \n\"Going into that inning we have got six outs left in the game, four-run lead, I've got my three best relievers and they went through that whole inning. All of them pitched,\" Hinch said. \"So wrestling with it, it wasn't - there were really no tough calls for me ... So the way it was mapped out was fine. I take my chances with six outs left with Harris, Sipp and Gregerson. \n\"It just didn't work out today.\" \nThe Astros bullpen as a whole finished going 2.2 innings, giving up seven runs on seven hits, while facing 17 batters in that span. \nIn the ninth a two-run bomb by Eric Hosmer into the Astros bullpen put the icing on the comeback win for the Royals, who now have a chance to clinch a trip back to the ALCS at home in front of their fans on Wednesday. \n\"Hopefully we can just keep this riding into Game 5,\" Hosmer said. \"The way that Houston's playing right now, these guys are playing light's out ball. They're a young, energetic team.\" \nFor the Astros being resilient is something they have shown all season, especially here in the postseason - Houston bouncing back from a tough 5-4 loss in Game 2 of the ALDS to win on Sunday at home to take the series lead. \nNow the Astros will have to bounce back at least one more time to continue playing playoff baseball in October. \n\"This group man, they are as resilient as any group I've ever been around in any role that I've served in this sport,\" Hinch said. \"They don't need to be told that this was a tough loss. They don't need to be told that Game 5's a big game. \n\"We're going to show up with our personality. We're going to give it everything we have to continue this season, as is the club across the way.\" \nHouston and Kansas City are now set for a decisive Game 5 of the ALDS on Wednesday at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City.
