It definitely is.\" \nThe news isn't terribly shocking from the 68-year-old coach. He announced prior to the 2012 games he was done, but got roped back in for the 2016 Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro. (Video via UNC-TV ) \nKrzyzewski's been involved with USA men's basketball since 1979 but wasn't named head coach until 2005. \nAnd since then, the USA's been dominant, to say the least. They're 75-1 under Coach K's tenure. \nWhat does leaving the USA Olympic team mean for his time at Duke? Probably nothing. (Video via The News & Observer ) \nAs recently as April, Krzyzewski's said he's not close to retiring. \n\"I'll be back next year and, I would think, for a few more years,\" Krzyzewski said on \" The Dan Patrick Show .\" \nAnd we're sure Krzyzewski will be invited back. Not only are the Blue Devils coming off a national title victory, but he's also the winningest active coach in NCAA men's basketball. Not bad. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:34:08.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
