The bodies of her nine-month-old daughter Divya and two-year-old son Vaibhav, who were charred to death in the “inter-caste violence”, were handed over to the family after autopsies. Hospital authorities said her condition was “critical”. She has been kept in the ICU as she has suffered “deep” burns. Her relative, Raj Bala, who was in the hospital, said Rekha was not able to speak. She was, however, conscious. She is not aware of her children’s deaths, Raj said. While the children died on the spot, Rekha and Jitender were admitted to the hospital yesterday. Jitender was discharged after being treated on an OPD basis. Activists of the Krantikari Veer Sangh and other organisations today protested the incident outside Haryana Bhawan. A sangh delegation submitted a memorandum to Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar through the office of resident commissioner demanding the immediate arrest of culprits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:15:17.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
