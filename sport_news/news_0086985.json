It's also the only way to separate yourself from the pack in daily fantasy football. \nEach week, we provide you with a few different players that might be flying under the radar. Here are this weeks bargain to target. 1. Ryan Fitzpatrick, quarterback, New York Jets \nThe Jets have their biggest test of the season against the New England Patriots this week. While the Patriots have been dominating teams, they have still been surrendering a fair amount of fantasy points. Ryan Fitzpatrick has been consistent all season. 2. Christine Michael, running back, Dallas Cowboys \nComing out of the bye week, the Dallas Cowboys seem ready to unleash Christine Michael. The Cowboys have a friendly matchup against the New York Giants, and as long as Michael gets the workload most are expecting, he should have a big afternoon. 3. Theo Riddick, running back, Detroit Lions \nAs the season has gone along, Theo Riddick's snap counts have steadily increased. Injuries have thrust him into the main role in Detroit's backfield, and he has a chance to put up some big numbers against the Vikings. 4. Chris Hogan, wide receiver, Buffalo Bills \nWith Sammy Watkins and Percy Harvin injured, Chris Hogan has a chance to play a big role in the Bills' passing game. He's been a reliable receiver for Buffalo in the past, and he has a friendly matchup against a helpless Jaguars secondary. If EJ Manuel can get him the ball, Hogan should come through. 5. Tavon Austin, wide receiver, St. Louis Rams \nThe Cleveland Browns' secondary has not been able to slow down anyone, so Tavon Austin could be in for a big afternoon. Austin is always a boom or bust option, but he's worth rolling the dice on with this matchup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:19:27.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
