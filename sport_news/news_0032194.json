He struck out four and did not walk a batter.\nThe Blue Jays had taken a 1-0 lead in the third against left-hander Martin Perez when catcher Dioner Navarro scored on a double-play grounder from Ryan Goins, then doubled the advantage in the fourth when Tulowitzki drew an RBI walk.\nPerez struggled with his command after a promising start and ended up walking three and allowing four runs on six hits before being replaced in the sixth inning.\nFour Texas relievers combined to throw 2-2/3 scoreless innings.\nTulowitzki, third baseman Josh Donaldson and center fielder Ryan Pillar collected two hits each for Toronto.\nLeft fielder Josh Hamilton finished with two of Texas' five hits.\n(Compiled by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:48:35.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
