Buy Now Joe Burns \nJacque Bartosh (left) and Madison Baumert combine to block a Syracuse shot in the Eagles' win at home on Tuesday night. \nArlington wore down Syracuse on Tuesday night at home, widening their margin of victory set after set in a 25-20, 25-17, 25-14 sweep of the Rockets. \nThe win was the 11 th in 12 games for the red-hot Eagles, and head coach Brandon Mues said his team is capable of better volleyball than was on display Tuesday night. \n“ We played well at times tonight, but our communication broke down often and we didn't cover out hitters very well,” Mues said. \nNonetheless, the Eagles handled a 7-20 Syracuse team in the fashion a dominant team should, which is easier said than done. Now, they have some time off before next Tuesday night's trip to county rival Fort Calhoun, an improving team with talent on the front line. \n“ I'm excited for this team,” Mues said. “And we have an entire week to improve and get better at all levels.” \nArlington, offensively, was led by sophomore Shelby Kaup's 11 kills. Junior Jacque Bartosh added eight kills and drew compliments from her coach. \n“ Jacque had a big night at the net, providing a spark when we needed it,” Mues said. “It's nice to see her step up and take of the pressure off our other hitters.” \nKaup also led the Eagles with four aces, while senior Mariah Kaup, and sophomores Grace Volk and Madison Baumert all had a pair. Bartosh recorded a team-high four blocks, while Baumert and Mariah Kaup had three. Senior Savanah Reed finished the match with 16 digs, while Hannah Marquardt added 14. \nArlington 3 Syracuse 0 \nSyracuse (7-21) 20 17 14 0 \nArlington (17-7) 25 25 25 3 ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:48:44.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
