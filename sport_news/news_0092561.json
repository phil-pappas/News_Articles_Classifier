It opened two years ago, a childhood dream of owner and Venezuelan native, Andrea Hall. \n\"We were just thinking it was going to be just a family business where we were just going to sell empanadas and it just grew,\" said Hall. \nFood is the focus of Empanada Madness, but so is family. Her brother hosts and takes orders, her step-dad is the main cook in the kitchen and her mom brings out the delicacies. \nWhen they opened, business was slow. People didn't know a lot about Venezuelan cuisine. \n\"They're kind of scared to try the food, but once they try it, they're hooked,\" Hall said. \n\"Okay it's chicken and cheese and rice and lots of mystical herbs and spices. But it's so good, the combination is perfect for that. It is great,\" said customer Melba Stroud. \nBut it wasn't enough to have fans of the food. They needed more. \n\"I think everything started with Salvador coming into the restaurant,\" said Hall. \nSalvador Perez, the Kansas City Royals all-star catcher was such a big fan of Empanada Madness, he posted on social media, a lot. That brought the people in. \n\"I come here because I follow Salvy on Instagram. And he always recommends it so. Pretty good,\" said a fan of Perez at the restaurant. \nHall said Perez comes by the restaurant every home series. \nSalvy's bond with Hall grew so close, he sent her on the road, all expenses paid. \n\"He took me to Chicago to see the Cubs play with my husband. It was really nice. We also went to the All-Star Game with Salvy. It was super, super fun,\" she said. \nYou could say they're family. \n\"He's my brother for sure, that how we see him,\" Hall said. \nA close family helps each other out. Last year before the Royals’ playoff run, Hall didn't know if the restaurant would stay open. \n\"We definitely thought we were going to close our doors. And all the support we got with Salvador, and (Alcides) Escobar, (Omar) Infante. I can't thank them enough for that. Kept us open for sure,\" she said. \nSalvy still stops by for lunch and catches the customers by surprise. \n\"And all of a sudden we look over to the right and it's Salvy, and Orlando (Paulo), and Cheslor Cuthburt and they're all sitting there with the groundskeeper and everyone is like, 'Oh my,’” said customer Chelsea Soetaert. \nBut it's the food and family feeling that brings customers back. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
