(JANE TYSKA) OAKLAND -- What has been speculated is now official: Steve Kerr will not be on the bench when the Warriors begin the defense of their NBA title Tuesday night at Oracle Arena, and he could miss a number of games at season's outset as he continues to recover from back surgery. \nGeneral manager Bob Myers confirmed Saturday that Kerr, who attended practice and enjoyed his most involvement on the court since he initially left the team at the outset of training camp, still isn't ready to return to the bench. Luke Walton will continue to serve as interim head coach until Kerr is able to return. \n\"I talked to Steve and he is improving, but there still is no timeline as to when he's coming back,\" said Myers. \"He's confident he will be back, but it's all speculation as to when. So he told the team that Luke's going to start the season as the coach, and they're fully aware that they're going to have to accept more responsibility. Luke we have full confidence in, he has a great staff around him.\" \nMyers said Kerr would continue to stay engaged with the team and talk to Walton frequently. \n\"Luke will hold down the fort until Luke's able to come back, and stay back,\" Myers said. \nKerr will be present before Tuesday's game against the New Orleans Pelicans to take part in the championship ring ceremony. Advertisement \nWalton said he was told Friday that he would begin the season as the head coach. Walton coached the Warriors' summer league team and also has been the head coach throughout the entire preseason, and said he has been preparing mentally for the possibility of being the regular-season head coach to start the season. \n\"The preseason's been great for some of the stuff, but that's all over now,\" he said. \"We'll find out Tuesday what it's really like, and I'm looking forward to that.\" \nKerr was not available for comment after practice.
