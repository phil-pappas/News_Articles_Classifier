I believe politics should be separated from sports. Otherwise it's really difficult for all nations that are playing the game and we all should play each other. \n\"When Australia didn't tour Bangladesh recently that was disappointing as well,\" Misbah said. \"As cricketers we want to play each other, and we don't want any sort of politics involved in this sport.\" \nPakistan have no intention of pulling out from the World T20 in India, which will be played at eight venues including Mumbai, but Misbah spoke of strong concerns about playing in India amid political tension. \n\"These are the big concerns,\" Misbah said, referring to the protests. \n\"Obviously when these sort of things happen, that really puts something in your mind. I don't know what is going to happen but obviously these are the big concerns. You don't want to restrict yourself not to play here and there. We really want to play everywhere and enjoy the game.\" \nThis is not the first time Pakistan have expressed such concerns. The Pakistan women's team was forced to play their 2013 World Cup group matches in Cuttack, following threats from political activists in Mumbai.
