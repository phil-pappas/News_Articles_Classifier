It's been a difficult weekend because of the little running we got, we didn't get much practice,\" said a jubilant Rosberg. \n\"But qualifying worked out really well, I found a good balance on the car, we had to guess a bit where it was going to be but it all worked out well. I felt comfortable and got some good laps in. Very happy with that.\" \nImmediately after the session Hamilton was already looking to Sunday and plotting a move into Turn Two where Rosberg tried to pass him last year. \n\"As you saw last year, this is not such a bad race for P2,\" said Hamilton \n\"It's one of the longest runs of the whole year so it should create opportunities. But there'll be other opportunities during the race I'm sure.\" \nValtteri Bottas delivered on the pace Williams had shown throughout practice to take third for Williams, just ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. \nThe Finn was a long way clear of Williams team-mate Felipe Massa who was a shock Q2 casualty with the 15th quickest time. \n\"It was not just a mistake, it was a problem with the traffic,\" Massa complained to Sky Sports F1. \nKimi Raikkonen was fifth for Ferrari, but nearly four tenths behind Vettel, with the Force India pair of Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez exploiting the power from their Mercedes engines to take sixth and seventh.
