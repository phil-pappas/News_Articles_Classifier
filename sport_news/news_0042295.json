In the 2000 meeting, then-first-year New Albany head coach Kevin Roth guided the Bulldogs to a 28-17 victory at Blair Field over Jeff, which was coached by then-new head coach Steve Cooley. Cooley is currently Clarksville’s head coach. … From 1904-71, the Bulldogs took a huge lead in the overall series with a 34-0-5 record. But since Jeff’s first victory over New Albany in 1972, the Red Devils have gone 36-15 against the Bulldogs. \n• ANALYSIS: One of New Albany’s main concerns entering its 91st meeting with Jeff is it must limit the number of big plays by the Red Devils’ skill-position weapons. If Jeff has good nights from quarterback Cam Northern, running back Jordan Barnett and wide receivers Brandon Coleman and Isaiah Blanton, it is going to be a long night for the Dogs. But the Red Devils also must be wary of New Albany’s skill-position players, who have shown they can come up with some big plays in 2015. \nBEDFORD NORTH LAWRENCE AT FLOYD CENTRAL \n• TIME: 7 p.m. \n• RECORDS: Floyd Central 4-2, 3-1 HHC; Bedford 2-4, 2-2. \n• RANKINGS: Floyd Central — AP Class 5A No. 17. \n• SERIES RECORD: Floyd Central leads 22-19. \n• SERIES STREAK: Floyd Central has won two in a row and six of the last eight meetings. \n• LAST MEETING: Oct. 3, 2014 at BNL Field — Floyd Central 21, Bedford 14. \n• KEY FACTS: The Highlanders’ four victories this season have come against opponents (Providence, Madison, Seymour and Jeff) with a combined 6-18 record. Floyd Central’s two losses were against foes with a combined 12-0 mark. The pair of opponents that have handed the Highlanders’ setbacks in 2015 were 6-0 Louisville Male and 6-0 Columbus East. … Floyd Central and Bedford are in the same sectional, which is Class 5A Sectional 16, for the first time in three years. The Highlanders and Stars were paired together in Class 5A Sectional 8 from 2007-2012. \n• ANALYSIS: This should be a very physical game on the line of scrimmage where each squad wants to establish the running game. Floyd Central is looking to bounce back after getting thumped by the Olympians last Friday, 49-13. \nSILVER CREEK AT NORTH HARRISON \n• TIME: 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:07:14.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
