I came up with this invention to keep foods separate.\"\nHe developed the COOLER ACCESSORY to organize the contents of a cooler. The unit keeps dry items separate from water left by melting ice. This ensures that dry goods remain dry in storage. It prevents foods from becoming soggy and inedible. The device separates beverages from the other contents. Additionally, it is adaptable for use with most coolers.\nThe original design was submitted to the Fresno office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
