It was a huge momentum swing for us. Upper Arlington had just drove the field and scored on us. We needed a lift. The thing is, I had two long TD runs in similar situations against Central Crossing (two weeks ago) when everyone knew what was coming. The line just buckled down and got it done.” \nUpper Arlington had taken the opening kickoff and put together a 14-play, 80-yard drive capped by Danny Logan’s 4-yard touchdown run. He finished with 89 yards. \nDavidson countered with a 48-yard field goal by Robert LeFevre on its next series. \nUpper Arlington continued to control the ball until Royer’s 71-yard TD run gave Davidson a 10-7 lead. \nLater in the half, Upper Arlington quarterback Vince Murdocco mishandled an errant shotgun snap, and Davidson’s Zac Uphouse recovered near midfield. \nRoyer capped an 11-play drive with a 1-yard TD run just before halftime that made it 16-7. The extra-point kick was blocked. \nUpper Arlington (5-2, 2-2) had several scoring opportunities in the second half but was stymied by a fumble, a missed field-goal attempt and two fourth-down stops. \n“We had the ability to do some things tonight, but turnovers hurt us, and we just didn’t execute well enough,” UA coach Joel Cutler said. “They outperformed us and outcoached us. Hand it to Royer. He’s a tough kid. That big play really hurt us, but we still had plenty of chances after that and just couldn’t get it done in the red zone.” \nRoyer, a junior who played cornerback last season, has come into his own for Davidson (6-1, 4-0). \n“He’s gotten so much better since week one,” White said. “He was a good running back then, but he has turned into a real good one between then and now. His balance and vision really set him apart, and he’s always falling forward for yardage.” \nDavidson has won seven straight in the series for a 15-5 lead. \nsblackledge@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:04:38.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
