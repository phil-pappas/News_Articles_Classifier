What do you think? Be the first to comment \nThey are expecting anything up to 100x that when the Mancunian side head down the M6 on Saturday. \nTies against AFC Wulfrunians, Basford United and Spalding United have ensured Khalsa are well and truly on the map – but for tonight it back to the bread and butter as they visit Staffordshire side Brocton in the Premier Division.
