There is an old baseball axiom you have to be strong there to win a World Series. And it is a strength — superior defence from catcher through the middle infield to centre field — that the Blue Jays and the Royals have in abundance. But offensively, the Jays will need to pick it up.\nThe Royals made a key acquisition at the deadline that is often overlooked by experts who point to flashy right-hander Johnny Cueto. They picked up versatile switch-hitter Ben Zobrist from Oakland in July and installed him at second base, solving a problem. The former Tampa Bay star is now paired with shortstop Alcides Escobar at the keystone and together they excel for the Royals.\nThe Royals have an everyday stud and Gold Glover behind the plate in all-star Sal Perez, while they boast an MVP candidate, the speedy Lorenzo Cain, in centre field. In the five games of their division series against the Astros, in which the defending AL champions never seemed to truly be in it until the eighth inning of Game 4, the Royals four up-the-middle position players combined to go 21-for-73 (.288), with three doubles, a triple, three homers, eight RBIs, six walks and 14 strikeouts.\nOn the other side of the diamond, the Jays also made a key acquisition in the middle infield at the trade deadline, one that spurred them to the AL East title. Most Jays fans consider the Troy Tulowitzki trade on an equal plateau with the David Price deal in terms of shrewdness and turning around the fortunes of the ball club. Tulowitzki combines with second baseman Ryan Goins who, despite being hitless in five ALDS games, saved enough runs to justify his everyday status.\nThe primary receiver is Russell Martin, with Dioner Navarro the personal catcher for Game 1 starter Marco Estrada. In centre field is the underrated Kevin Pillar, who finished second to the Rays’ Kevin Kiermaier for runs saved on defence by an outfielder. In the five games of the ALDS, the Jays’ up-the-middle group combined to go 13-for-79 (.165) with four doubles, two homers, nine RBIs, four walks and 20 strikeouts.\nThe Jays offence scored 26 runs in the five games against the Rangers, while the Royals tallied 25 vs. the Astros. The Jays’ primary offensive contributions clearly are produced at the corners and DH with Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion, but Goins and Tulowitzki know their value as defenders and, in the still-hobbled shortstop’s case, he was a necessary catalyst to the Jays’ comeback, chipping in with a clutch three-run homer in Game 3 when they trailed two games to none.\n“Obviously that was big, but we had to win two more games,” a humble Tulowitzki said in the moments after Game 5. “For me that was huge. I’m battling out there, to be honest. My shoulder ... I keep on saying I’m not 100 per cent, but I keep throwing it out there. It’s fun to win. (The regular off-days) help a little bit, but at the same time, I’m just not taking my reps in the cage, but it’s OK.”\nTulowitzki returned to action in time for the final regular-season weekend in Tampa, as the Jays were in the process of surrendering first place overall in the AL and home-field advantage to the Royals.\n“We’re not done yet, that’s the cool thing,” the 29-year-old all-star said. “We’re playing the ALCS next and then hopefully a World Series and we’ll take it from there. We’ve been talking about this all year long, since I got here — that we have a special team and we definitely want to win it all.”\nGoins earned his everyday role for the Jays, even against left-handed pitching, with his spectacular glove work and a consistent line-drive bat, but against the Rangers and their four left-handed starters, the Texas native was hitless in 17 at-bats, with a walk and five strikeouts. He did lay down the bunt in the seventh inning of Game 5 that Beltre threw to Andrus and was dropped for an error.\n“I didn’t swing the bat well the whole series, so I was just trying to do what I could do to help the team, whether that be baserunning, defence, moving runners over,” Goins shrugged. “That’s my game. I’m not here to hit homers. There’s another series coming up and I’ll be ready to go.”\nGoins immediate impression in the giddy aftermath of Game 5 vs. the Rangers? “That was the most fun baseball game of my entire life.”\nJays fans would find it hard to argue.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays and Royals say bad blood is behind them\nEstrada, Navarro team on the art of pitching: DiManno", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:25:05.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
