(AP) — Cam Coffman threw for 213 yards and three touchdowns as Wyoming snapped a nine-game losing streak by beating Nevada 28-21 on Saturday afternoon. \nBrian Hill rushed for 188 yards for Wyoming (1-6, 1-2 Mountain West) while Coffman completed 18 of 20 attempts with no interceptions. It was the Cowboys’ first win since beating Fresno State 45-17 on Nov. 1, 2014. \nTyler Stewart completed 25 of 41 attempts for 287 yards and two TDs for Nevada (3-4, 1-2). His 7-yarder to Jerico Richardson, who made a juggling catch while falling backward, drew the Wolf Pack within 28-21 with 6:36 remaining. \nNevada forced a Wyoming punt, but Stewart was sacked by D.J. May on 4th-and-5 from the Cowboys 36 with 1:36 remaining. Wyoming blitzed and Eric Nzeocha knocked the ball from Stewart, but the quarterback recovered and was drilled by May for an 18-yard loss. The Cowboys then ran out the clock. \nWyoming had gone up 28-7 with 11:21 left in the third quarter on a 5-yard rush by Kellen Overstreet through a pile of defenders. Later in the period, Stewart drove the Wolf Pack 79 yards and tossed a 12-yard pass to Jerrod Gipson to make it 28-14. \nThe Cowboys had gone up 21-7 with 27 seconds left before halftime when Coffman found Jake Maulhardt standing alone in the back left corner of the end zone. Maulhardt had six receptions for 54 yards. \nJacob Hollister caught an 18-yard TD pass to put the Cowboys up 7-0 early in the second quarter. Hollister gathered the ball near the left sideline then bowled over Asauni Rufus at the 8 on his way to the score. \nAfter Nevada tied it 7-7 on a 7-yard run off left tackle by Don Jackson, Coffman spun 360 degrees on a scramble and hit Tanner Gentry down the left sideline for a 27-yard score. Gentry was heavily defended by Elijah Moody but outfought him to make the catch at the goal line. \nBrent Zuzo had not missed a field goal in seven previous tries for Nevada this season, but the streak ended with a 52-yard miss in the second quarter. \nJordan Dorich led the Wolf Pack defense with 13 tackles, while Rufus added nine. For Wyoming, May finished with nine tackles, two pass breakups, a forced fumble and a sack. Andrew Wingard and C.J. Jennings also had nine tackles apiece for the Cowboys. \nThe game featured no turnovers. \nHill’s 33 rushes were a personal best and his 188-yard total was his fourth-highest. He has gained more than 100 yards in nine of his last 12 games. Wyoming’s offense tallied a season-high 485 yards and the Cowboys held a halftime lead for the first time in 10 games dating back to last season. \nNevada had 405 yards, second-highest of the season. Hasaan Henderson made eight catches for 112 yards and James Butler rushed for 51 yards on 10 carries.
