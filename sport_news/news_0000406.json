Joe allows you to do some things that you might not be able to do with other guys. Joe can lock down half of the field or you can put him on the best wide receiver and not have to worry about helping him at certain points of the game. There's a ripple effect, but the best coaches and the best coordinators in this league, they adjust and they push forward.\" \nBrowns coach Mike Pettine added, \" It has an effect. That's not the exclusive plan with Joe, but it's the way you would prefer it to be. We don't get into measuring that, how significant that is. It goes back to the old saying, 'You can't win with players that aren't out there.' \n\"We are full speed ahead with the guys we have, formulate the best plan that we have and put those guys into position, but we weren't just going to bump a guy up and say, 'Okay, you're in the Joe Haden spot.' Joe had that skill set, that ability. He's demonstrated that, time and time again, to take a receiver out, and we've had to do some different things coverage-wise to compensate for it.\" \nPettine says it has been difficult to gauge Haden's progress through the protocol, and that he hopes the player undergoing the tests is able to show improvement every day. \n\"Those tests, they take them in the room, they issue the tests and we find out long after the fact,\" Pettine said. \"I don't know if those are pass/fail. You hope there's improvement every day, but you get some guys that'll be symptom free for a while and then, they have a setback. The protocol is strict and it's conservative, obviously, for a good reason. Anytime you're dealing with a concussion, you just have to err on the side of caution.\" \nAccording to O'Neil, the Browns have \"to mix\" their uses of man and zone coverages \"a little bit more\" without Haden than if he was able to be on the field. \n\" We're always going to play some man just because that's how we're structured,\" O'Neil said. \"That's the way we recruit on the outside at that position group. That's why all those guys are here because they can play man. You may have to do some things to give a guy covering the X or give a guy that's in Joe's position a little bit more help.\" \nShould Haden indeed remain in the NFL Concussion Protocol over the weekend and miss Sunday's game against the St. Louis Rams at the Edward Jones Dome, the starting role could again go to Pierre Desir, who has played his way into the starting lineup despite being a fourth-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, the same class in which they spent the No. 8 overall pick on another cornerback, Justin Gilbert. \n\"Pierre has done a pretty good job establishing himself as our third outside corner, but that doesn't mean that that's set in stone,\" O'Neil said. \"Justin, right now, has looked as good as he's been since he's been a part of this organization. He's definitely going in the right direction.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RZJ5qX TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:17:31.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
