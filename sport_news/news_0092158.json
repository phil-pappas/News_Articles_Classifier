The timing makes it less attractive for U.S. brands because it is too early for most West Coast viewers, although international brands may be more open, the media buyers said.\nMoreover, fans in the game's local markets of Buffalo and Jacksonville will be able to view it on television through their CBS affiliates.\nYahoo is guaranteeing advertisers 3.5 million streams in the United States, the sources said. If the game does not achieve that goal, the advertisers were promised spots on Yahoo that would be targeted to those viewers, the media buyers said.\nWhile that is an attractive offer given how large Yahoo's platform is and how targeted it can be with its ads, some advertisers bristled at the possibility of paying \"NFL premiums\" for non-NFL advertising spots, the media buyers said.\n(Reporting by Jessica Toonkel in New York; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:48:18.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
