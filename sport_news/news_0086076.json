The Cobras beefed up their bowling stocks by luring Wayne Parnell from the Warriors in the off-season, and the left-armer could make his debut after overcoming an injury to be included in the squad for Saturday . With Vernon Philander available the Cobras have a strong seam attack which has also been bolstered by a lesser-known talent recruited from the Dolphins, whom coach, Paul Adams, expects to settle in quickly in the absence of Hendricks. Asked which of his players would be one to watch this term, Adams sys: ‘Tshepo Moreki is a young up-and coming cricketer who had a great winter tour with the Academy in Sri Lanka, so hopefully he can show some good form for us.’ The Cobras have made the final of both limited-overs competitions for two seasons running, and their ability to continually attract fresh talent makes them one of the obvious favourites this time around. However, Adams pointed out the importance of constantly keeping ahead of the competition: ‘Cricket in this day and age is an evolving game so you need to make sure that you’re on the button with how it evolves internationally and make sure that your players are adapting and moving along.’ The Lions will be without Eddie Leie, Aaron Phangiso and Kagiso Rabada, who are in India with the Proteas Twenty20 squad, and will also lose Temba Bavuma later this month. However, coach, Geoffrey Toyana, sees a clutch of players in his squad who are ready to step up and make a major impact. Toyana says: ‘I think a guy like Lonwabo Tsotsobe has worked hard in the off-season and has come through nicely, and Pumi Matshikwe is also a real work horse. I also see big things for Rassie Van Der Dussen this season – he’s been gun for us over the past couple of years – and a guy like Dwaine Pretorius. Hopefully those guys can start well and give us that momentum going forward.’ Photo by Carl Fourie / Gallo Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:29:36.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
