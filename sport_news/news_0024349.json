The Mustangs went right back to winning, scoring the first eight points of the match and sweeping Diablo Valley 25-8, 25-13, 25-19 Wednesday at Marcopulos Gym. Delta (11-4, 4-1 Big 8 Conference) suffered a five-set loss to American River College on Friday, and came home to shake it off against the Vikings (5-7, 1-4). The Mustangs easily handled Diablo Valley in the first two games, although the Vikings put up a better fight in the finale. Delta sophomore outside hitter Cassidy Caton said the Mustangs knew they had to get right back to business. “My attitude is that we just have to bounce back,” Caton said. “(American River) is a great team, we’re going to see them again, so there is no reason to worry about it. We just have to work hard to get better.” Caton had 10 kills, five aces and 15 digs, and said she was pleased with the Mustangs’ energy at the beginning of the match. “I think when we started, we were very confident with ourselves, but in the third set we kind of got comfortable and let them in,” Caton said. “We can’t get comfortable where we are. We also have to get better every set.” Sophomore setter Kirstin Kielhold served to start the match and put Delta up 8-0. Diablo Valley had a brief 3-2 lead in the second set before Delta took control. “We knew we had to come out strong and keep fighting, Kielhold said. “We don’t take any team for granted.” After losing the first two sets, the Vikings settled down and played a competitive third, thanks in part to freshman middle hitter Jade Lee, who had 10 kills. Delta jumped to a 7-1 lead, but DVC cut it to 16-15 in favor of Delta before the Mustangs finally finished it off. “You can only control what happens on your side of the net, and in the first set we didn’t control anything,” Vikings coach Jackie Ponciano-Babb said. “But we made progress as the match went on.” Kielhold had two aces, 30 assists and 11 digs, and Melanie Balaban had five kills and four blocks in two sets. “I thought they came out as a team and played really well together,” Delta coach Molly Mordaunt said. “We’re really working on consistency, In the third set (Diablo Valley) got back in it, and it was a good test for us to see if we could get out of it.” — Contact reporter Scott Linesburgh at (209) 546-8281 or slinesburgh@recordnet.com.
