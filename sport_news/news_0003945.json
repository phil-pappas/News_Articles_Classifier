I have to take my chance and score goals for the team -- that's why I'm here.\"\nThe 26-year-old has found it tough to break into the starting side due to the form of Aguero, while his progress has also been hampered by a series of injuries that restricted him to just two goals in 19 appearances.\n\"A lot of crazy things have happened since I joined City and I've been ruled out with injury three or four times so it's been hard to find any rhythm playing one or two games here and there,\" he said.\n\"It's been the worst spell of my career without question -- in the past five years I'd never missed more than two games in a row and at Swansea I only missed a handful of matches and that was mostly because of a red card I received.\n\"I've had nothing but bad luck in the past year, but hopefully, that's the end of it now. It's not been the best time for me in that respect and has been very frustrating, but hopefully the City fans will now see the new Bony,\" he added.\n\"All I need is the first goal to come and hopefully many others will follow.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:14:59.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
