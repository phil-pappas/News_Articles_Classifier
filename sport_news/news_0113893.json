Lightfoot was born in Kansas City, moving to Arizona when he was 6. He lived in Tucson until last year when the family moved to Gilbert. \nMore on the commitment at kusports.com and in Sunday’s Journal-World.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:53:15.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
