The president of the country's football assocation says his organization did not buy any votes nor did they have a slush fund, as was alleged. \n\"The 2006 World Cup was a summer fairy tale and it is a summer fairy tale. The summer fairy tale is not destroyed because we entered the competition with legal means and we won it with legal means in Zurich on July 6, 2000 for us, for Germany, for German soccer,\" said Wolfgang Niersbach, GFA president. \nDer Spiegel: 6.7 million euros used to buy votes \nFrankfurt's state prosecutor says it will look into the 'Der Spiegel' report that Germany's bid committee apparently tapped into a slush fund of 6.7 million euros to buy the votes. Niersbach, Franz Beckenbauer -- who headed the organizing committee for the 2006 tournament -- and the DFB are vehemently rejecting the allegations as 'groundless' and say the magazine is providing no evidence to back up its claims.
