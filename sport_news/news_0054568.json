This weekend we want to make Australia proud of their team.\" \nOpenside Michael Hooper will make his 50th Test appearance and wing Drew Mitchell is just one try short of drawing level with Bryan Habana and Jonah Lomu as the leading World Cup leading try-scorer of all time. \nAustralia: I Folau; A Ashley-Cooper, T Kuridrani, M Giteau, D Mitchell; B Foley, W Genia; J Slipper, S Moore (capt), S Kepu, K Douglas, R Simmons, S Fardy, M Hooper, D Pocock. \nReplacements: T Polota-Nau, T Smith, G Holmes, D Mumm, B McCalman, N Phipps, M Toomua, K Beale.
