Updated: Tue 12:14 AM, Oct 20, 2015 / Headlines List / Article \nLEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Matt Jones believes John Calipari will have a good basketball team in the season ahead. \nSo you probably watched Big Blue Madness on Friday last week and you probably thought, 'Hey, Kentucky's pretty good, and we have some talent.' But Kentucky's John Calipari seems to disagree with you. Remember he said last week he thought his team stunk and we wouldn't be good at the beginning end of the year. \nNow I'm gong to tell you a little secret. He's lying to you like he often does. This Kentucky team is good. Now they're ranked preseason number one and I'm not sure if I agree with that. But when it comes time at the end of the year, they have a chance to be as good as anybody. \nYou have to think about this: I judge teams by whether or not they have NBA talent and Kentucky likely has two of the top four picks in next year's NBA draft in Skal Labissire and Jamal Murray. Plus I think they might have the best point guard in college basketball in Tyler Ulis. \nAs I was watching them play in Big Blue Madness, I noticed that this team has a lot of things going for it, including how quick they are going to the basket. This may be one of the fastest teams John Calipari has ever had. They will attack the rim and they'll score. But they're not going to be as good defensively as some of Cal's teams from the past. \nThey don't have the rim protectors and they're not quite as quick on the wing to be able to stop. Nevertheless I think this team is very good. Don't believe Cal, he's trying to bring down expectations. But at the end of the year Kentucky will be there and they have a shot at number nine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:07:26.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
