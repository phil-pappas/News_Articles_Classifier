That hasn't stopped tens of thousands of people from chipping in with checks as small as $10 to let the Republican candidate know they're behind him.\nTrump has taken in 73,942 contributions, a total that surpasses several GOP rivals, despite the billionaire businessman's pledge to finance his own campaign. Financial reports filed last week show that more than 70 percent of the $3.9 million he raised from July through September came from people giving $200 or less. That rate of small-donor contributions is second only to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\nThe average Trump contribution was $50.46, his campaign said.\nThe contributors are in small towns, suburbs and big cities. He's raised money from hundreds of retirees, ranchers, dentists, physicians, real estate executives and financial consultants.\nFor Ansley Pascoli, 64, a retiree in Sandy Springs, Ga., the money is intended as a symbol of support. She gave the Trump campaign $25 and bought several hats and T-shirts.\n\"One of my reasons for wanting to support him is that even though I know that he does have a lot of money, I don't feel that it's right for him to have to bear the burden,\" she said in a telephone interview when asked why she was giving money to someone who has bragged about not needing campaign cash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:06:32.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
