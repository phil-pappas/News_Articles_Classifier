Next question,\" or some variation. Hardy had his third sack in two games since returning from a four-game suspension for violating the league’s personal conduct policy. \nGiants sit Moore \nThe Giants essentially benched third-year defensive end Damontre Moore by making him inactive, capping a rough week for the team sack leader. \nMoore was fined $20,000 for his late hit on Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford last Monday night, a penalty that kept alive a drive and allowed Philadelphia to march down field for a touchdown. \nWith starter Robert Ayers returning after a four-game absence due to a hamstring issue, the Giants opted to keep Moore out of uniform. \nAsked if there was any correlation between the events of the past week involving Moore and the team’s decision to sit him, Giants coach Tom Coughlin said: \"That’s between me and him.\" \nOn the spot \nThis was Myles White’s first NFL start at gunner on the Giants’ punt coverage team and he made the game-sealing play when returner Cole Beasley botched the catch. White secured possession with 1:26 left, allowing the Giants to run out the clock. \nBriefs \nWR Rueben Randle beat Cowboys CB Brandon Carr with a one-handed catch in the third quarter just one season after Odell Beckham Jr. earned national attention with The Catch at Carr’s expense. \"That’s pretty bad luck,\" Randle said. … Rookie DE Owa Odighizuwa suffered a hamstring injury on the opening kickoff of the second half and did not return. \n— Jeff Roberts and Art Stapleton © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:51:54.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
