Grier has been suspended for the remainder of the season for taking an over-the-counter medication that “had something in it” in violation of NCAA policies. Posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 6:14 pm Florida QB Will Grier suspended for violation of NCAA policy on banned substances Robbie Andreu Halifax Media Group dailycommercial.com | 0 comments \nWhat has been a dream season so far for the undefeated Florida Gators took a dark and unexpected turn on Monday. \nStarting quarterback Will Grier was suspended for a calendar year by the NCAA after testing positive for a banned performance enhancing drug, UF coach Jim McElwain announced. \n“Grier won’t play this week and obviously in the near future due to taking a supplement, an over-the-counter supplement that had something in it that was on the NCAA list of things that you can’t have,” McElwain said. “It’s something that he feels horrible about. It’s an honest mistake and, yet, can be prevented by just checking with our medical staff. Want everybody to understand that this is a mistake we’ll learn from. \n“Obviously this is hard. I don’t want anybody in here to forget we’re in this for these young men. We feel for him. We feel his pain. He had a chance to address the team and spoke from the heart.” \nWith Grier suspended, true sophomore Treon Harris takes over as the starter. He started the final six games last season and was in a dead-heat with Grier for the starting role through the spring and preseason camp. Grier became the full-time starter in the third game. \nUF will appeal Grier’s suspension, McElwain said. The school likely will file that appeal with the NCAA in the next day or two and could have a ruling before Saturday’s game at No. 6 LSU, unless the NCAA needs more time or possible legal action is pursued. \n“We will, as a university, appeal this,” McElwain said. “And we support Will, his family, in every way possible. And yet, we also know that there’s certain steps that go along the way when taking an over-the-counter supplement. Doesn’t matter what it is. That’s the way it is.” \nGrier spoke briefly at Monday’s news conference, choking back tears while admitting he made a mistake. \n“So, I took an over-the-counter supplement that had something in it, and I did not check with the medical staff before taking it,” Grier said. “I really hope that people can learn from this, learn from my mistake. I’m really, really sorry to everyone. Just really sorry.” \nUF would not reveal the substance Grier tested positive for. He was tested about two weeks ago. McElwain said he learned the result Sunday, the day after Grier helped the Gators defeat Missouri 21-3 to move to 6-0 on the season and 4-0 in the SEC. The win boosted UF to No. 8 nationally in The Associated Press poll. \nUF is not facing a possible forfeiture of games, so the Gators’ undefeated season goes on. Grier’s doesn’t. \nGrier loses 25 percent of his overall eligibility as a first-time offender, according to the NCAA drug testing policy. The redshirt freshman will be classified as a junior when he returns next October. \nWhen Grier first reported to UF in January of 2014, he measured 6-foot-2, 183 pounds. On the current roster, he’s listed at 6-2, 203. At the team’s media day in August, Grier talked about how he gained 15 pounds of muscle over the summer \nGrier will remain on the team and continue to practice. He can attend home games, but is not allowed to travel with the team to away games. \n“When you have an opportunity to sit down and visit with him and see the remorse and the sorrow, that’s hard,” McElwain said. “That’s really hard as a coach, but more so as a human, to see someone go through that. It’s not easy. \n“But he knows we’re here for him. He also knows as with whatever guys that have missed throughout the season, next guy up. He reiterated that to the football team, which I thought — you know what, that speaks volumes for his character. I wanted him to be able to visit with our team as well before we did this. \n“It’s a loss. But we also have other guys, and we’ve got to move forward. Hopefully, guys will learn from this and see, as he said, it’s an opportunity through his choices, hopefully some guys will learn from it.” \nMcElwain said he’s convinced Grier made an honest mistake and that he did not intentionally take a performance enhancing drug that is banned by the NCAA. \n“I mean, you just look at, over the counter,” he said. “I mean, you and I can both go get it. Anyone in this room can, anybody in this country can. ... The mistake is, and the lesson for whoever out there, make sure — just like we educate our guys now — check with your medical staff before you put anything in your body. Doesn’t matter. Cough medicine. You have to know what you’re putting in your body. \n“Will admitted he didn’t (check). I think that speaks for him. He’s not putting it on anybody else. He’s a stand-up guy. That’s how he played the game and plays the game. He’ll be back. It’s an honest (mistake).” \nGrier addressed his teammates earlier in the day, telling them he’d made a mistake that they should all learn from, McElwain said. \n“They hugged him. They care about him, and they appreciated his honesty,” McElwain said. \nMcElwain said the bottom line is Grier should have known better than to take any supplement that wasn’t first approved by the UF medical staff and trainers. \n“Well, everybody knows it’s policy,” he said. “You police yourself. You know that you’re supposed to check before you put anything in there, right? So you’re no different. You either do it or you don’t. It happened, now we’re dealing with it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:03:06.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
