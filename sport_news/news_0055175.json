Trailing 5-2 with runners on first and second, the fans must have been experiencing a feeling of deja vu as the 2014 Royals always found a way to get the key hit or defensive gem to win their first eight playoff games. But this is 2015, and Astros reliever Oliver Perez coaxed Hosmer to hit a foul pop fly to third baseman Luis Valbuena, and the Astros went on to claim a 5-2 victory to take a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five series. The home team is now 0-4 in this year's playoff games. “The good thing about tonight is that we have a quick turnaround, play tomorrow afternoon and forget about this one,” Hosmer said. “They are a good team. They remind me of our team – great starting and relief pitching, they got some big hits and threw some leather at us. “But it's just one game. We're fine, we'll come back tomorrow and be fine. No one is down in this locker room. We're all looking forward to tomorrow.” Royals starter Yordano Ventura looked like anything but an ace as he left the rain-delayed game after allowing three runs in two innings. “He was ready, but it didn't work out tonight,” interpreter Christian Colon said, speaking for Ventura. “He felt good, they scored some runs and he can't control the rain.” Jose Altuve led off the top of the first inning with a single and went to second on a walk to George Springer. Carlos Correa followed with a soft single to right to load the bases. Colby Rasmus and Ryan Gattis collected back-to-back RBI infield groundouts to give Houston a 2-0 lead. The Astros added to their lead when light-hitting Jake Marisnick doubled and Altuve followed with an RBI single in the second. Ventura managed to pitch out of the inning as a light rain turned into a downpour. Before the tarp was put on the field, Morales hit the first of his two solo homers to make it a 3-1 game. Following a 49-minute rain delay, Chris Young was summoned from the bullpen and struck out the side in the third and fourth innings. Morales hit his second solo homer to cut the deficit to 3-2 in the bottom of the fourth inning, but Springer homered in the top of the fifth off Young and the Astros once again had a two-run lead. Page 2 of 2 - After Young's one-run appearance, Kelvin Herrera pitched a scoreless seventh before Ryan Madson came in from the pen and gave up Rasmus' second home run in as many postseason games. Rasmus tied a major league record with at least one extra base hit in his first five postseason games. Astros starter Colin McHugh allowed the two Morales' homers in six innings. The Houston bullpen did not allow a run. But upbeat Royals catcher Salvador Perez put the positive spin on the loss. “We need to win tomorrow and we will find a way to,” Perez said, grinning, while teasing late members of the television media who arrived at his locker. “We're OK. It's only one game, but we do need to win tomorrow. We have (Johnny) Cueto pitching and he is a big game pitcher. This is why he is on this team, to pitch a game like tomorrow.” By Bill Althaus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:15:45.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
