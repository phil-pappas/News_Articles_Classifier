Comment   By Will Gilbert Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 1:58 PM By Will Gilbert Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 1:58 PM Heber Springs Heber Springs, currently ranked No. 1 in 4A, has waffled anywhere from its current position to No. 10 in the high school cross country polls this fall. Looking at their past, odds are the Panthers will place second in the state considering they have done so every season since 2003. By the same token Heber has won every state meet held on an even year since 2004, equaling five state championships and five runner-up finishes in the past 12 years. Oddly enough this year’s team is led by four standouts in four different grades including senior Patrick Hill, junior Jesse Applewhite, sophomore Lane Carter and freshman Parker Ables. Throw in sophomores Max Schroeder and Beau Tucker, junior Blake Eddington and senior Gabriel Bray, who transferred from Greenbrier over the summer, and the Panthers are once again in the running to become the first Heber team to win back-to-back championships. Before driving his team to a farm south of town for a practice run on an unseasonably warm afternoon two days ago, Heber Coach Dale Cresswell said he thinks this team has a chance to break the odd streak. “I don’t want to be jinxing it but we have a good chance,” said coach. “Every year we have a chance to run well but this year I think we have a better chance than we did a couple of years ago. You never know you gotta run the race on that day. Right now it looks like we could make it on an odd year but you never know until you get there on that morning of Nov. 7 and figure out if we’ve got it that day or not.” Berryville, paced by Oliver Perez who holds a top time of 16:07, is expected to provide the stiffest competition for the Panthers to overcome. “Berryville has some good runners,” said Cresswell. “Shiloh could be in there but it will probably be between us and Berryville.” All four of Heber’s top runners have set their personal best times over the past month. Junior Jesse Applewhite ran a team best and personal best time of 16:56 at the Chile Pepper in Fayetteville. He followed that up by placing second individually last Saturday at Bryant with a time of 16:57.50. Applewhite sped past Ables down the stretch to finish second behind Sheridan’s Auggie Morgan (16:50.96) at Bryant, where Carter posted his personal best time of 17:55.40, which was good for 18th overall just behind Hill (17th, 17:54.11). Tucker finished 25th at 18:23.64. “Jesse is just an athlete,” Cresswell said. “He doesn’t work harder than any of the rest of them. He does what he has to do to get through practice. He could probably do more than run distance if he wanted to. Parker was beating him at Bryant and he sprinted it out to beat him. He is just a true athlete.” Page 2 of 2 - Running on a rugged Bald Knob golf course this past Tuesday, Hill set his personal best time of 17:38 to earn first place at the Harding Bison Stampede. Applewhite (17:40) was second, while Carter, Schroeder and Eddington also earned medals by placing in the top 10. “At the beginning of the year Patrick hurt his hamstring and his back was hurting,” said Cresswell. “Yesterday’s race [in Bald Knob] was on a hilly course and I know he has worked on hilly courses a lot before like Josh Park [at Dam Site]. I think his confidence level is up some.” Ables, who missed Tuesday’s meet at Bald Knob to perform with the band, is on pace to become the best distance runner in Heber’s illustrious history. “I haven’t had a ninth-grader run a 16:57,” said Cresswell. “But we did have Brock Ballard and Austin Schmidt place second and third or third and fourth at the Chile Pepper when they were ninth-graders but I don’t think I’ve ever had a ninth grader run under 17 [minutes] in a 5K before. “I’ve compared him to Brock and Jake Sanders and I don’t think they got under 17 minutes until they were in high school. Parker has a good future ahead of him not only in cross country but also in track and field. He is going to be an outstanding 800 meter runner and he can be a great 1600 meter runner. He also pole vaults, he is in band and academically he is great. He is a well-rounded individual,” added Cresswell. Underclassmen at this point, Carter and Ables are the cornerstone of a solid future along with the aforementioned sophomores. “Lane is working hard,” said Cresswell. “He is getting stronger and every once in awhile he will go out and work at weight meets with the football team.” Heber travels to Lake Hamilton tomorrow and Batesville this coming Tuesday to prepare for the big day on Nov. 7 at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs. Lady Panthers The Heber Springs Lady Panthers, who have won six state titles including back-to-back championships in 2012-13, are striving to overcome injuries as the 4A state meet approaches Nov. 7 at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs. With junior Grace Lehfeldt and sophomore Ali Jones hampered by injury, junior Erin Holland stepped up and placed 15th overall at Tuesday’s Harding Bison Stampede in Bald Knob. Sophomore Hailey Southerland and freshman McKeeley Cresswell are also showing promise for the Lady Panthers. Notes At the Harding Bison Stampede held at Bald Knob this past Tuesday, nine Heber runners finished as medalists including Sterling Thomas (Jr. Girls), Patrick Wilson (Jr. Boys), Trenton Barnes (Jr. Boys), Chancey Ivener (Jr. Boys), Patrick Hill (Sr. Boys), Jesse Applewhite (Sr. Boys), Lane Carter (Sr. Boys), Max Schroeder (Sr. Boys) and Blake Eddington (Sr. Boys).
