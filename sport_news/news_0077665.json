He’s a lifer. He’s not a guy who’s going to take things for granted. He works hard at it. That’s why he was successful as a player, and that’s why he’ll be successful in management. He puts his time in.”\nSweeney has been grinding in this game since 1988, when he quickly reached the NHL after four years at Harvard. Only 5-foot-10 and 185 pounds in an era when size was critical for NHL defensemen, he became a key, top-pair guy largely because of his quickness and intelligence.\nSweeney played 1,115 NHL games — plus another 108 in the playoffs. He was a Bruin for 15 years, before playing his final season with the Dallas Stars, retiring after the 2003-04 campaign. In June of 2006, he rejoined the Bruins as director of player development and was off and running in learning every aspect of team management.\n“He’s a smart kid,” said his ex-teammate. “The big thing about him is that he spent the last 5-6 years learning from Peter (Chiarelli) — the entire business. He’s down in Providence (AHL), he’s up in Canada watching the junior leagues. He’s learned pretty much the entire business.”\nAnd now Sweeney, 49, brings that knowledge and work ethic to the Bruins GM job. His mandate: To get the team back on track after it was derailed last season by roster and salary cap mismanagement by Chiarelli.\nWith the same sort of attitude that a rookie NHL player would be wise to adopt — keep your mouth shut, your eyes open and work hard — Sweeney is happy to talk about players, but isn’t keen on talking a lot about his job performance thus far. Maybe later in the season, he’ll say.\nToo bad, because there’s been plenty to talk about. Sweeney had been in the GM seat barely two months when his team went through a shocking and tumultuous week this summer: Unable to re-sign defenseman Dougie Hamilton, Sweeney was forced to trade him to Calgary; Milan Lucic, certain to become too pricey as an UFA next year, was dealt to Los Angeles; the B’s wheeling and dealing resulted in having picks 13, 14 and 15 of this year’s draft; then on July 1, he signed UFA Matt Beleskey and traded for Jimmy Hayes.\nPlayers like Matt Irwin, Joonas Kemppainen, Zac Rinaldo and Jonas Gustavsson were added as part of a stunning rebuild.\n“He handled it exceptionally well,” said B’s executive director of player personnel John Ferguson, who previously spent five years as Toronto Maple Leafs GM.\n“There were challenges — there always are. But he has made the most of the opportunities. It’s been an exciting time, fulfilling, and in many ways it feels like we’re just getting started.”\nFerguson was impressed by Sweeney’s ability to deal with the setback of the bizarre departure of Hamilton, and scramble quickly to a Plan B.\n“I’ve heard (longtime NHL GM) Lou Lamoriello say, ‘I’ve got a five-year plan ... which changes every day,’ ” said Ferguson. “So, yes, there are many things that have been executed (this offseason). Certainly I wouldn’t be grading anyone at this point — certainly not my boss — but he’s been tremendously dedicated and involved.”\nSweeney has spent years in the player development area and understands very well how important it is to have young players — with relatively small salaries — moving up to take NHL jobs.\n“I think it’s paramount,” said Sweeney. “It’s a lifeline to sustaining the level of play that you want as an organization and not have dips. At times, we had a stretch where we didn’t do it very well. I think we’re pointed back in the right direction.”\nSweeney brings the same attributes as a manager as he had as a player.\n“Those attributes are well known to those who know him: Dedicated and disciplined, well educated,” said Ferguson. “He does his homework, seeks opinions, digests information. He’s very well organized. These are attributes that tend to help people achieve great success in whatever field they’re in.”\nFans can decide for themselves whether Chiarelli deserved to be fired, or should have gotten the chance to fix the salary cap mess he helped create.\nThere’s no argument, though, that his replacement stepped in, went to work and re-designed a team that could be pretty good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:46:18.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
