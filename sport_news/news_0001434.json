Fordham's Chase Edmonds broke Scheuerman's league record with 347 yards rushing and scored four touchdowns overall in the Rams' 59-42 victory over the Mountain Hawks.\nBut as he sat in a cramped room in Fordham's Vincent T. Lombardi Memorial Center late Saturday afternoon, Coen sounded very different than he did seven miles to the south in Yankee Stadium's vast press room last year.\nCoen had trouble suppressing tears after the season-ending loss to Lafayette, but on Saturday, he was fired up, pounding the table at one point, to let everyone know that Lehigh still had four games to play and was capable of playing better.\nThe difference between this game and the 2014 Lafayette disappointment from Coen's perspective was that his team competed, and competed hard and had a chance to pull a major surprise against the No. 10-ranked FCS-level team.\nInstead, it hurt itself with turnovers and penalties, not to mention missed assignments and tackles.\nLehigh led 21-14 when it lost starting quarterback Nick Shafnisky to a hip-pointer that was the result of an end zone collision at the end of a two-point conversion run. That was with 10:26 left in the first half.\nThe Rams would score 38 of the game's next 45 points and lead 52-28 with 12:52 left after an interception was returned for a touchdown.\nHowever, it was at that point that Lehigh delivered a positive stretch that bodes well for the final month of the season. The Mountain Hawks staged two TD drives behind freshman QB Brad Mayes, forced two Fordham punts and had another drive, going to the Rams' 18 with 2:35 left.\nA missed field goal and another Edmonds touchdown run smashed Lehigh's comeback bid, and yet, the spirited effort offered a glimmer of hope going forward.\nThree of the four remaining games are at home, starting with Saturday's contest against Georgetown.\nThe Mountain Hawks are 3-4 overall, 1-1 in the league and still not out of the league championship picture. There were plenty of positives on Saturday, like 491 yards of offense and a second straight 100-yard rushing effort by freshman Dom Bragalnone, who ran for 109 yards on 19 carries.\n\"We can still play for a championship,\" Coen insisted. \"We go back home now for the next two weeks. If we can take care of our business there then we can make November a pretty interesting month for us.\"\nHowever, a team that was banged up entering the Bronx left it even more battered. Offensive lineman Steve Camasta, one of just two seniors up front for Lehigh, left with what looked like a major knee injury.\nCoen said he hoped to get a determination on Shafnisky's status as early in the week as possible.\nIf he can't go, Mayes proved on Saturday he can move the team and make strong, accurate throws.\nHowever, Shafnisky's running ability, experience and mastery of the offense can't be replaced.\n\"Nick is such a dynamic player,\" Coen said. \"Brad's more of a thrower than a runner, and if he has to play, our offense next week will feature more tailback-oriented runs. He's not a bad athlete at all, he's just more of a pocket-type passer and he has a good arm.\"\nAnd it's not as though Mayes hasn't had a lot of time working with the offense.\n\"We give our 2s [second-team guys] a lot of reps,\" Coen said. \"We give Nick a lot of plays off toward the end of the week, so Brad gets a lot of reps. What happened today will pay dividends. I was just telling the other coaches that I wish he could have thrown 30 passes in a blowout win rather than it come while we're scrambling to get back in the game.\"\nCoen said that no matter what, his team will keep battling.\n\"It's a great group of guys,\" he said. \"We just have to learn from our mistakes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:56:50.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
