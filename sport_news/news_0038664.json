Jamie's older sister, Hannah Brooks, 20; and Jamie's twin brother Maxwell, who is a freshman at Northwestern University this fall, at the coronation ceremony Oct. 2.\nLater that evening, Jamie's friends in the special education program gathered at the football game, joining forces with Hersey's student fan group, \"Orange Crush,\" in the new ADA accessible stadium stands, which allow students in wheelchairs to enjoy the celebrations alongside their regular education classmates.\nIndeed, as the special education headquarters for Township High School District 214's six high schools, Hersey's inclusive culture goes far beyond complying with federal ADA requirements, Hersey Principal Gordon Sisson said.\n\"There is no mandate for students to do the right thing at the right time,\" said Sisson, who greeted Jamie with a playful fist pump when she dropped by the principal's office on a recent afternoon.\n\"Jamie is very popular, and we have exceptional students here who recognize she's an exceptional individual, and I'm incredibly proud of all of them.\"\nSitting alongside her longtime friend and Hersey's homecoming king Brett Miller, Jamie was refreshingly candid, saying that while she had many friends on the court, \"I wanted to be a winner.\"\n\"Everyone we walked by was clapping and congratulating her, because everyone loves Jamie,\" added Brett, who said he hopes to attend the University of Minnesota next year, where he plans to major in either psychology or special education.\nA member of Hersey's show choir, On Stage, Brett said his interest in special education began after he was selected to assist students enrolled in the high school's Career Life Skills program during their P.E. class.\n\"It gave me a whole new outlook on special education, and I realized these students are a lot of fun,\" Brett said.\nHersey counselor Mary Ann Jahrling said special education students like Jamie have the opportunity to participate in an array of extra-curricular activities.\nFor example, Jamie is paired with regular education student \"buddies\" from choir and orchesis who assist her in performances with the high school's Super Singers and Dynamic Dancers.\nWhile most special education students are enrolled in Hersey's Career Life Skills curriculum, some students also attend regular education courses, including art, foods and graphics, Jahrling said.\n\"Having all the special education students from the district's six high schools here together at Hersey is really, really nice, because it's the best of both worlds,\" Jahrling said. \"We can address a student's own individual needs and levels, but they can make friends out of the special education program.\"\nWhile Jahrling said Jamie's recent nomination to the homecoming court was exciting, she was a bit nervous that if the teen was not named queen, she could have been very disappointed.\n\"We worked really hard with Jamie to address the possibility of her not winning,\" Jahrling said, \"and we talked a lot about how important it was to be happy for other people by clapping for them, and shaking their hands.\"\nOf course, in the end, the social tools Jamie learned while rehearsing for a potential defeat were not needed, as the irrepressible teen with a wicked sense of humor stepped up for her big moment.\n\"I'm so happy,\" said Jamie, adding with a smile, \"I'm the homecoming queen.\"\nkcullotta@tribpub.com\nTwitter: @kcullotta\n High Schools", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615ac60/turbine/ct-arh-hersey-homecoming-queen-tl-1015-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-08T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:06:19.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
