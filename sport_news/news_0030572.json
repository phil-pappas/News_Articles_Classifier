plays pivotal innings as India square series with South Africa 14 Oct 2015 16:01:52 \ncomments \nMS Dhoni's unbeaten 92 proved crucial as South Africa collapsed chasing just 248 to lose the second one-day international by 22 runs and allow India to level the series at 1-1. \nThe Proteas appeared to be cruising on 134 for two but Axar Patel removed JP Duminy and Faf du Plessis in quick succession and India continued to take regular wickets on their way to a crucial victory. \nDhoni had earlier given India something to bowl at after taking his side from 124 for six to a competitive 247 for nine in Indore. \nSouth Africa made a flying start to their run chase but Hashim Amla went for one shot too many and was stumped by Dhoni in Patel's first over, bringing an end to his 40-run opening stand with Quinton de Kock, who then departed for 34 after lofting Harbhajan Singh straight to Mohit Sharma at long-off. \nDu Plessis and Duminy came together and initially milked the spinners for ones and twos before taking Suresh Raina and Umesh Yadav for a flurry of boundaries. \nIndia were in desperate need of a breakthrough and Patel delivered by trapping Duminy in front for 36. \nDu Plessis survived a run-out scare to bring up his half-century off 51 balls but he was on his way when he hit Patel straight to Virat Kohli at cover. \nAnd India were right back in it when David Miller edged Bhuvneshwar Kumar behind first ball. \nAB de Villiers tried to relieve the pressure with a four and six in a Kumar over but the South Africa captain was on his way when Kohli took a diving catch to give Sharma the prize scalp. \nThe tourists were well ahead of the run rate but wickets continued to tumble, Dale Steyn the next man to go after miscuing a drive off Umesh Yadav into the safe hands of Kohli. \nSouth Africa still needed another 62 with only three wickets remaining and they were 200 for eight when Farhaan Behardien was caught down the leg side off Harbhajan. \nKagiso Rabada did his best to put the pressure back on India but he was left stranded on 19 after Kumar removed Imran Tahir and Morne Morkel in the same over to secure a memorable win for India. \nAfter winning the toss and choosing to bat, India suffered an early blow when Rohit Sharma, who made 150 in the first ODI, was comprehensively bowled by Rabada for just three. \nAjinkya Rahane got the hosts going by taking 12 from a Steyn over but he lost Shikhar Dhawan with the score on 59, Duminy taking a simple catch at short cover off a Morkel slower ball. \nWorse was to come for India when Kohli was run out with both batsmen at the non-striker's end after Rahane was dropped at mid-off by Behardien. \nRahane put the mix-up to the back of his mind to go to his second fifty of the series with a deft shot over the wicketkeeper but it was 102 for four after he was bowled round his legs attempting to sweep Tahir. \nRaina did not trouble the scorers as he nicked a short leg-side delivery from Morkel and Patel was next man out when he was trapped lbw by Steyn. \nDhoni and Kumar quietly went about rebuilding the innings but Tahir ended their partnership on 41 by bowling the latter between bat and pad, leaving the home side 165 for seven in the 40th over. \nHarbhajan had made his way to 22 off as many balls when he aimed a wild swing at a Steyn delivery and edged behind to De Kock, with the same combination removing Yadav three balls later. \nImportantly, Dhoni was still there and he hit the final ball of the innings for six to set South Africa 248 to win, which proved too much for the tourists.
