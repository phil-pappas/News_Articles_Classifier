Here's some advice for Arizona as it prepares for Saturday's homecoming game: Expect the pass.\nThe Cougars come to Tucson as one of the conference’s surprise teams. The Wildcats wouldn't be surprised if Washington State throws the ball 50 times, or 60, even 70. In 2013, the Cougars threw the ball — and this is not a typo — 89 times against Oregon. This season, WSU leads the nation in pass attempts per game; quarterback Luke Falk throws the ball an average of 54.1 times.\n“They throw the ball a lot,” UA cornerback DaVonte’ Neal said. “It means we have a lot of opportunities to go get the ball. They’ll put it in the air for us.”\nAdded Jace Whittaker, a true freshman cornerback: “That’s what you live for as a defensive back, you live for them to throw the ball.”\nThe Wildcats might know what's coming. That doesn't necessarily mean they can stop it.\nAZCENTRAL\n'Sack master' Jack Banda surprising standout for UA football\nArizona’s has the the third-worst pass defense in the Pac-12. A matchup with the Cougars' \"Air Raid\" offense pits a seemingly unstoppable force against a, well, very moveable object.\nFalk has been particularly difficult to defend. Since the Cougars (4-2, 2-1 Pac-12) lost to FCS Portland State, Falk has completed 72.2 percent of his passes; he leads the conference in passing yards.\n“We just got to get quality corner play,” UA coach Rich Rodriguez said. “It’s been OK, but this is a different challenge.”\nLast week, with Neal injured, Arizona (5-2, 2-2 Pac-12) gave Whittaker his first career start, and it showed. Colorado’s Shay Fields had four catches of 15 or more yards on Whittaker, including a 72-yard touchdown.\nCam Denson is a converted wide receiver playing cornerback, and has gone through some growing pains. Sammy Morrison began the year starting opposite Neal, but has since fallen behind Whittaker on the depth chart; Jarvis McCall, a starter for most of last season, has barely played in recent weeks.\n“Corners — and I’ve been on them about playing with confidence and understanding you’re not going to win every play and all that — but I wanted them to be aggressive and compete,\" Rodriguez said.\nWhen Washington State upset the Wildcats in 2013, nobody in the defensive backfield, outside of Will Parks, recorded a tackle.\nAZCENTRAL\nUA football facing puzzle in Mike Leach's Washington State\nDenson was in the middle of his senior season at Tucson Salpointe Catholic. Whittaker was a junior wide receiver at Oceanside (California) High School; Neal, then a receiver, was sitting out the season after transferring from Notre Dame, and McCall was redshirting as a freshman.\n“We’ve been playing harder out there, doing the little things and just trying to execute assignments,\" Denson said. \"It’s not much what other people are doing, it’s more what we’re doing for ourselves.”\nAdded Neal: “We’re all competitive, we all compete in practice. Everybody should know what they’re doing across the board.”\nThe Wildcats allow 248.6 passing yards per game, and outside of the Oregon State 44-7 win two weeks ago, it’s been even worse in Pac-12 play. UCLA’s Josh Rosen, Stanford’s Kevin Hogan and Colorado’s Sefo Liufau combined to complete 71.1 of their passes for six touchdowns and zero interceptions; they rushed for four touchdowns, too.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats vs. Washington State Cougars: TV, radio, stadium information\nFalk and the Cougars are fresh off a two-game winning streak. Arizona must figure out a way to stop him.\n“Their quarterback is playing at a high level, and they’re playing with a lot of confidence now,” Rodriguez said. “Since the beginning of the year, they’ve gotten better each week. For us defensively, we’ve got to play a whole lot better.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd1c0c33bcccefaa0529c7c6cf8c692df594c16b/c=712-0-3464-2752/local/-/media/2015/10/21/Phoenix/Phoenix/635810489606632392-092015-spt-uafb-main-p8.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c47d660a401556d2cda0cdf550493e6d1fa9b13/c=87-0-612-525/local/-/media/2015/08/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635762183712997114-arizonawildcats.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e4b6d89d46b09eec8df1ba5234c3f4c18ef106cb/c=0-8-2029-1154&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/20/Phoenix/Phoenix/635809708600444787-leach.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/52b7fefc5c5a19f9831663f6d2f103b48ce65f55/c=0-118-1444-1562/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Phoenix/Phoenix/635811527087578060-Banda.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:56:43.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
