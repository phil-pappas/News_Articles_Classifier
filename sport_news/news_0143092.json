The Patriots improved to 5-0 for the first time since 2007. It was the first meeting between the rivals since the \"Deflategate\" storm erupted after the AFC title game in January. For a half, the teams traded jabs. But New England seized control in the second half. Brady's 25-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowksi gave New England a 27-21 lead. And when the Patriots stopped the Colts (3-3) on an odd-looking and ill-advised fake punt, the scrambling Brady eventually found LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard scoring pass that made it 34-21. Andrew Luck was 30 of 50 for 312 yards and three touchdowns in his first game back from an injured right shoulder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:09:11.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
