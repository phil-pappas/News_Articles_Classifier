Check out the two plays at the end that decided it. On the first possession of overtime, facing a fourth-and-goal from the 1, Falmouth High School running back Connor Aube dropped a direct snap on the turf, and then picked it up and ran into the end zone. After a successful two-point conversion, his team led 22-14. After hitting Justin Stacy with a 7-yard touchdown pass on a desperation fourth down on his team’s overtime possession, Marshwood quarterback Cole McDaniel tried to tie the game with a two-point conversion of his own. As he was rolling right, he seemed to brush against a teammate and the ball got dislodged, bouncing away from him toward the sideline, ending the play. And the game. And the hopes for finishing in first place. “The coaches felt that he had the corner,” said Marshwood coach Alex Rotsko. “I don’t know if the back knocked it out of his hands or he just dropped it, but it looked like we had (the conversion).” A bigger difference was the reaction after Falmouth’s come-from-behind, 22-20 win. The visitors whooped it up after the handshakes, thrilled that the best season in the program’s 13-year history will include the No. 1 seed for the regional playoffs, which begin in two weeks. “We’ve never been 7-0 so this is a very big win for us,” said Falmouth coach John Fitzsimmons. “It looked dark for us for a while.” And the Hawks, who have to make peace with 5-2? They felt they let this one get away, after scoring on their first two possessions after halftime to take a 14-6 lead and stuffing their foes on a series of possessions. “Big mistakes,” said linebacker/offensive lineman Zach Mitchell. “Penalties, fumbles, missed snaps. We could have won this game.” The Hawks, who finished with a 348-124 edge in total yardage, will try to rebound next week at rival York (2-5) and secure the No. 2 seed, with the hope of getting another crack at the unbeaten Yachtsmen down the road. “We made mistakes that we don’t usually make, but at the same time you have to give credit to them,” said running back/linebacker Zach Doyon, who rushed for 137 yards on 18 carries, going over the 1,000 mark for the season. “They’re fast, they’re quick to the ball and their D-backs tackle really well. We had a couple runs that we could have broke and they made good plays in the secondary.” Down 6-0 after an inefficient first half, the Hawks stopped Falmouth on the opening possession after halftime and got into an offensive groove, driving 73 yards on 14 plays and going up 7-6 when Stacy plowed into the end zone from 2 yards out. On their next possession, early in the fourth quarter, Doyon capped an 84-yard march with a 26-yard scoring run, a move that saw him spin around fully after hitting the hole and streaking to the end zone. Max Horton’s second PAT made it 14-6. But just when it looked like the Hawks had worn the Yachtsmen down and would nail down the win, their foe made a nifty adjustment, running Aube out of a Wildcat formation and moving the ball down the 17 with less than two minutes left. On third-and-6, Aube, back in his regular spot, took a pass over the middle from Jack Bryant and scooted to the end zone on the left. On the conversion, his second effort on a run up the middle tied the game 14-14 with 1:22 left. “No big surprises; he’d just a good athlete,” said Rotsko. “I think it was a smart thing to do, to let him try to run the ball and run the game, which he did.” “He’s quite the special player,” said Fitzsimmons. “First, we realized we were having more success with that and also, if you go down, you’re going to go down with one of your stars. And he’s the star.” In a defensively-ruled first half, the difference was a 50-yard punt return by Aube midway through the first quarter, a burst up the gut of coverage that set up the Yachtsmen with a first-and-goal from the 10. On the next play Brandon Martin ran in for a score and it was 6-0, the extra point getting blocked by Mitchell. Marshwood’s first four possessions ended in punts, producing just one first down. It got a short field when Jonathan Stacy partially blocked a Falmouth punt, but the drive petered out at the 19, McDaniel throwing incomplete into the end zone on fourth down. The Hawks were also penalized six times for 55 yards and committed the half’s only turnover when Doyon fumbled the exchange on a double-reverse at midfield. “Our defense did a pretty good job in the first half,” said Rotsko. “They’ve got some good, skilled kids. Offensively we were terrible in the first half. I think we started three different drives with a first-and-15 or first-and 20. … It’s tough to play like that.” Falmouth 22, Marshwood 20, OT Falmouth 6 0 0 8 8—22 Marshwood 0 0 7 7 6—20 First Quarter Fal—Martin 10 run (kick blocked), 4:24.
