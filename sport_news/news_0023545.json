I'm not self-confident enough to think I have had the only role in his development, but of course I did play a big part.\n© Provided by Goal.com \"We all know the best players of today. Tomorrow we don't know who it will be, so we can work on this. The will to improve is the most important thing for a Klopp player. Character.\"\nThe manager also says young players should be excited to play for him.\n\"When I manage a club, each young player should smile because the chance is bigger for them than it ever was,\" he said. \"The door is pretty wide open and I don't care about experience. Experience is an important point, but not the most important.\n\"Of course if a player is on a top level already and you can hold this for two or three years, then everything is perfect. But the young guns are very interesting. That’s what I enjoy doing.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:57:29.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
