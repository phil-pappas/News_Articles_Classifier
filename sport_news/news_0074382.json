Charlie Baker, and activists like Pete Frates, who inspired the ALS Ice Bucket challenge. In all, 36 of the 50 most powerful people in the city’s business commnity are white men, according to BBJ .\nJust one woman of color, Whittier Street Health Center CEO Frederica Williams, is on the list. No men or women of Asian descent were chosen, a drop from the five selected last year.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Last year’s Power 50, in contrast, featured 30 white men and 12 total women. That list also featured nine people of color, more than double this year’s tally.\nThe Power 50 also leaves off Stan Rosenberg , the president of the Massachusetts state senate and one of the state’s most powerful openly gay leaders.\nExecutive editor Doug Banks told Boston.com that BBJ editors receive nominations from outside business leaders. BBJ then compiles the Power 50 from there. Although diversity was a consideration in that process, “it’s not certainly the final one,” Banks said.\n“[Diversity] is an important issue in Boston,” Banks told Boston.com. “This list shows the city still has a long ways to go.”\nBanks added that diversity was a “major theme” in BBJ ’s work, and specifically pointed to their Leaders in Diversity awards event later this month.\nThe lack of diversity on the list came in for criticism from several people , most prominently David Bernstein , a contributor to Boston magazine and WGBH.\nIn response, Banks said the list’s lack of diversity was due to the local business community itself.\n@dbernstein ... or perhaps the Boston business community needs to get more diverse, as you've reported yourself?\n— BBJ Editor (@BosBizEditor) October 7, 2015 “Diversity is a discussion we’re willing to have,” Banks said. “I don’t think 140 characters at a time is the best forum for it.”\nGallery: Major companies that call Massachusetts home.\nPrevious -- of -- Next New England Confectionery Company (NECCO), Revere.
