Courtney Halter was the leader with 22 digs. Alexis Mapes and Ashley Hacker led the team with 29 and 25 assists, respectively. \nThe Coyotes came out hot in the first set, starting out with a 5-0 lead that they would not give up. IUPUI would tie the set at 20, but following a timeout, USD would put four straight points on the board with Haley Jorgensen finishing of the set with a kill. Reeg had seven kills in the set, including two in a row after the 20-20 tie. \nIUPUI would duplicate what USD did in the second set, only trailing in the set at 2-1. The Jaguars’ Hickey recorded eight kills in the set. \nA comeback was needed for the Coyotes to win the third. USD called a timeout down 19-14 and immediately got two blocks from Biltoft. They would then get three more blocks and a pair of kills each from Reeg and Lindsey Brown to take the set 25-22. \nThe fourth set was all USD as it would not trail again after starting out with another big lead at 5-to-1. Reeg and Brown each notched four kills in the set, while Biltoft added two blocks and three kills. \n“I always think we are going to put ourselves into that position to win,” Williamson said. “I tried to keep them motivated and not be satisfied with a few point lead, but to push the lead and make it tougher on them and keep earning our points and not rely on them to give us our points.” \nThe Coyotes finished with four player in double digits for kills. Reeg led with 19, while Jorgensen added 12, Hayley Dotseth had 11, and Brown finished with 10. \n“Lindsey Brown had a great night, 10 kills, .455, with no errors, I mean that’s huge for us,” Williamson said. “Haley Jorgensen on the right side again, she had a big match a week ago on Sunday. She struggled on Tuesday, and came back today and hit .333.” \nWith the win the Coyotes improved to 2-5 in the Summit League, while IUPUI, which started the day second in the conference, fell to 5-2. USD will look to continue the success today (Saturday) against Fort Wayne at home. \nFollow @michaelhammond_ on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:14:12.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
