No one within the organisation seems to have a problem with this way of functioning,\" Jadeja was Quote: d, as saying.\nThe 44-year-old, however, thanked everyone who helped him to get involved with Delhi cricket, adding that his sole objective was to see that cricket and players are not left disadvantaged.\nOn him not accompanying the Delhi Ranji team to Rajasthan, Jadeja said, \"\"I have read in the newspapers that the reason I have not travelled with the team is because Amit Bhandari has been appointed assistant coach.I would like to clarify that this is not the reason. It is sad to see that once again players are being used to settle personal scores in the DDCA.\"\nJadeja was appointed by nominees of the Delhi government, and refused to travel with the team for their opening match of the the 2015-16 Ranji Trophy season against Rajasthan that starts from Thursday.
