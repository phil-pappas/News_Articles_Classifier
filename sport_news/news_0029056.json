He replaced Tommy Bowden in midseason with Clemson in freefall. \n“We’ve come a long way in the seven years since that time,” Swinney said this week. \nThe fifth-ranked Tigers (5-0, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) attempt to take another step forward when they face Boston College (3-3, 0-3) on Saturday night. \nSwinney was a little-known receivers coach at Clemson was he was placed into the head coach’s office by former athletic director Terry Don Phillips. \nSwinney’s first coaching victory came at Boston College in 2008, a week after losing his debut game against Georgia Tech. These days, Swinney has the Tigers knocking at the door of the College Football Playoffs. \n“At the beginning, we were just selling hope and belief and all that, and now we’ve got results,” Swinney said. \nClemson is seeking its third 6-0 start in the past five years and its 34th consecutive victory over an unranked opponent. \nThe Eagles won’t make it easy. They come with the country’s top defense and have given up just two - that’s right, two - offensive touchdowns this season. \nBut they haven’t played on offense like Clemson, which is averaging 431 yards and 35 points a game behind quarterback Deshaun Watson and tailback Wayne Gallman. \n“Our defense is playing phenomenal, that’s not deniable,” Boston College coach Steve Addazio said. “We are going to face a real strong offense right now. So that’s what we’re going to find out from Saturday’s game.” \n___ \nSome things to watch when No. 5 Clemson plays Boston College: \nCLEMSON’S DEFENSE: The Tigers defenders are pretty good, too. They rank 13th nationally in defense and last week, held Georgia Tech to its lowest rushing total (71 yards) in coach Paul Johnson’s eight seasons. Clemson safety Jayron Kearse says his team is ready for the challenge. “We want to go out and show that we’re the better defense on the field,” he said. \nBC QB? Eagles coach Steve Addazio says he’s got a starting quarterback for Clemson, he’s just not saying who. Since starter Darius Wade fractured his left ankle last month against Florida State, Boston College has platooned two freshmen in Troy Flutie and Jeff Smith. Addazio said he’s made some decisions about the plan of attack, but is keeping that under wraps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:14:21.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
