Arnold, who is beginning his senior year, joined DU in 2012 at age 21, after a three-year, junior-A career with the Green Bay Gamblers of the United States Hockey League. Arnold played in a Clark Cup finals game on his 21st birthday, May 20, 2012, and another in the ensuing days.\nSince he hadn't begun his full-time college studies by the time he turned 21, he violated the NCAA's delayed enrollment rule that applies to all sports. Student-athletes must take at least 12 semester hours of college courses at age 21 to remain eligible to play in four years of college athletics.\nArnold said he didn't know about the rule, partly because nobody had told him because the USHL playoffs had not typically run into May 20.\nArnold was recruited by DU's former coaching staff, led by George Gwozdecky.\n\"If you're born on May 20, like Grant, and there is no playoff schedule, and you think the playoffs would be over before then, why would you go full-time in January when the semester begins if you don't need to?\" said DU coach Jim Montgomery, who is entering his third year. \"But absolutely, if you know you're turning 21 and games are going to be played, you have to go enroll full-time.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:17:40.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
