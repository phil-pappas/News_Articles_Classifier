The host Mustangs beat the Panthers 46-7. View More... \nThorndike â€” Sports often can be about lessons learned, even if some essentially are from the school of hard knocks. \nThus is the scenario that faced the Medomak Valley football team, in its first year of high school varsity play and off to a strong 4-0 start, on Saturday afternoon, Oct. 3. \nThe Panthers faced a tough test in game five of the season when they played host Mount View, a solid, well-coached, more established program that has realized success in recent years. \nThe Mustangs, who are making a strong playoff push, celebrated homecoming with a convincing, dominating 46-7 victory over Medomak Valley. \nIt was the Panthers' first loss and the Mustangs third victory in five games this fall. \nClick for photos from this game. \nWatch video below. \nNine different ballcarriers amassed 449 yards rushing on 60 carries, and collected 20 first downs, for the Mustangs. \nTyler Ripley extended his season streak of 100 yards rushing to five games by rolling up 165 yards on 13 carries, with a long run of 33 yards. Ripley scored two touchdowns and hauled in another 3-yard pass for a two-point conversion. \nDarrin Cook also exceeded the century mark by accumulating 111 yards on 12 carries and a touchdown, with a long run of 59. Jack Axsom and Laz Littlefield rounded out the scoring on the ground with 1- and 3-yard plunges, respectively. \nAlso rushing well for the hosts were Axsom (12 carries for 57 yards, TD), Gavin Simpson (11 carries for 37 yards), Cole Hannon (5 carries for 35 yards) and Kyle Noble (4 carries for 32 yards). \nSimpson gathered in the only other pass of the day on screen play from quarterback Hannan (2-of-3 for 27 yards) and made a \"spectacular\" 42-yard run for a touchdown, said Mustang coach Harold \"Haggie\" Pratt. \nDevon Davis received a punt in the third quarter and raced 75 yards untouched for a TD and Alex Bennett made three point-after kicks to round out the scoring for Mount View. \nOn defense for the Mustangs, Ethan Sewell-Berry (3 solos, 6 assisted tackles, fumble recovery, interception), Simpson (4 solos, 4 assists), Ripley (4 solos, 4 assists), Ben Rodgers (3 solos, 4 assists), Casey Spaulding (2 solos, 4 assists), Cook (2 solos, 2 assists) and Liam Cail (4 solos, 3 assists) led the charge. \n\"It was a great homecoming win for us,\" Pratt said. \"We needed to get back on track. I think the home field was a big advantage for us this week. It was the biggest crowd I have seen in my three years and they were vocal.\" \nThe coach added, \"Things certainly went our way Saturday. We got back to basics. We threw down a challenge to our offensive line in film sessions and they responded in a big way. The wind was a big factor so keeping the ball on the ground was important.\" \nMedomak Valley's lone score came on a 70-yard kick return by Cole Ashmore. Owen Gilbert added the extra-point kick. Zach Rollins led the Panther defense with seven tackles and a fumble recovery. \nMedomak Valley finished with 99 yards rushing, 20 yards passing and completed 12-of-20 passes. \n\"I thought our defense finally put together a great game,\" Pratt said. \nPratt said Medomak Valley was undefeated coming into Saturday's game and \"a bit of an unknown. I was very worried about the outcome of the game all week. They beat a well-coached Bucksport team in week one and handled scrappy Houlton quite easily last week. They have had great success running off tackle on everyone all season. I was very pleased with the overall improvement of our defense. We knew we needed to find a way to get better defensively this year if we wanted to be a playoff team.\" \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Crabtree Points for Class D North, Mount View (3-2, 116.4103) is fourth and Medomak Valley (4-1, 121.0256 points) third. Maine Central Institute of Pittsfield (5-0, 151.2821 points) is first in the 12-team region. The top eight teams qualify for the playoffs. \nMedomak Valley is ineligible for postseason play because the MPA placed the Panthers in a lower class than its enrollment dictates for the first two years of their varsity program. \nPrevious Mustang game \nIn Mount View's 20-19 loss to Orono Sept. 25, Pratt said the Mustangs played well, but the Red Riots that Mount View faced was not the same team the Mustangs scouted against Dexter. \n\"Orono was missing their entire backfield the previous week against Dexter, including their quarterback,\" Pratt said. \"However, everyone [for Orono] was healthy for [our game with them] and they are a pretty good football team when everyone is on the field. Orono scored with 16 seconds left and rushed for two points for the win. \n\"One-point losses are hard to take because there are so many things to think about that could have made the difference in the game. But our defense was much improved and I think we tackled better than any other game I have coached at Mount View.\" \nPratt added, \"Now we must look forward to a dangerous Buckport team. They are much better than their record indicates. They have a very strong passing attack and a Joel Sankey[-coached] Bucksport team is always well-coached. Every game is bigger than the week before when you get to this point in the season. Bucksport is one of those teams that Mount View has never beaten. We must play well if we hope to win.\" Medomak Valley at Mount View football Mount View of Thorndike hosts Medomak Valley in high school football action Oct. 3.
