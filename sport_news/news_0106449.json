GRAVES - AP Sports Writer Published: 10/23/15 2:11 pm EDT - Updated: 10/23/15 2:12 pm EDT \nAndre McGee resigned as assistant coach at University of Missouri-Kansas City on Friday, saying he could no longer do the job as he fights \"false\" allegations by an escort that he hired dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players while coaching at Louisville. \nMcGee is a former Louisville player who served as a graduate assistant and director of men's basketball operations at the school before coming to UMKC in 2014. \nIn his resignation letter to UMKC athletics director Carla Wilson, McGee said he couldn't perform his duties as a coach for the Kangaroos while also dealing with the allegations in Louisville. \n\"The university deserves a full time assistant coach and I am not able to provide that to the basketball team while the false allegations against me are being investigated,\" McGee wrote. \nKatina Powell, who appeared on ABC's \"The View\" on Friday with her daughters, wrote in \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen\" that McGee paid her $10,000 for 22 shows from 2010-14 with many taking place at the players' Billy Minardi Hall dormitory. \nPowell and daughters Shay, Lindsey and Rod Ni — all of whom Powell writes performed shows with her — appeared on the show with Powell's attorney Larry Wilder. They talked about an hour before McGee's resignation was announced. \nWilder of Jeffersonville, Indiana, said the crime of selling sex for money in Kentucky is a Class A misdemeanor with a one-year statute of limitations for prosecution. There is no such limitation for the promotion of prostitution, which Powell said is a Class D felony. \nThe attorney added said that if Powell is prosecuted, \"then they need to prosecute McGee as well because Mr. McGee participated by contacting Miss Powell, paying for the parties and paying for the provision of sex.\" \nPowell described her involvement as \"fun\" and shrugged off criticism of including her daughters in the shows. Rod Ni Powell added, \"going to the dorm and being around the basketball players. ... was fun.\" \nPowell's book has led to four separate investigations, two of which were immediately launched by the athletic department and NCAA when the school was notified of the allegations in late August. \nCampus police announced on Oct. 6 that it was working with Louisville Metro Police and the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office to review the allegations for possible criminal charges. \nThe University of Louisville Foundation announced the hiring of a law firm two days later to review the allegations. \nRick Pitino, head coach at Louisville, has denied knowledge of the activities described in Powell's book. \nBut on Tuesday, Powell said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that with \"a boatload\" of recruits and dancers, \"loud music, alcohol, security, cameras\" in a campus dormitory, \"how could Rick not know?\" \nUMKC said it would have no further comment while investigations being conducted by it, the University of Louisville and the NCAA are ongoing. \nScott C. Cox, McGee's Louisville-based attorney, didn't immediately return a message from The Associated Press on Friday seeking comment. \nAssociated Press writer Bill Draper in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.
