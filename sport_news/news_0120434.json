(Photo: James Lang, James Lang-USA TODAY Sports) \nOFFENSIVE LINE \nPenn State defensive end Carl Nassib, the national leader with 10 sacks, needed a half to get untracked, but he had a big third quarter and sure seemed like he deserved credit for more than 1.5 sacks. His mere presence might have been the reason Cardale Jones was so off-target when he was in there. Even though Nassib came alive, the ineptitude of the offense in the first and third quarters was mostly on Jones, not his blockers. The front five didn't need to open huge holes the way Ezekiel Elliott (153 yards on 27 carries, 1 TD) and J.T. Barrett (102 on 11 carries, 2 TDs) were running with the ball. OSU is now 12-for-12 in the red zone the last two games, 11 of those scores touchdowns. Taylor Decker and Co. obviously share in that success. \nGRADE: B \nRUNNING GAME \nEzekiel Elliott needed 25 yards to become just the ninth Buckeye to rush for 3,000 yards and he easily surpassed that total en route to his 12th straight 100-yard game. Braxton Miller and J.T. Barrett provided some fancy footwork to complement Elliott, but it would still be nice to see him used more as a slot receiver than Wildcat quarterback or shovel pass specialist. (That play is getting old.) Back to Elliott. Every game it's fair to ask: Where would this offense be without Zeke? Is it me or does J.T. Barrett (two TD runs) look quicker this season? Maybe it's all the rest he's been getting standing on the sidelines.Those days are probably over. \nGRADE: A \nPASSING GAME \nUrban Meyer, believe it or not, said he had to evaluate film before making a decision on a starting quarterback. It's unfathomable to think he could go back to Cardale Jones now after J.T. Barrett ran for two TDs and passed for two more in relief. It was nice to see OSU dust off the jump pass with J.T. (the T stands for Tebow) hooking up for a TD with Braxton Miller. Jones got good protection in the first half, but misfired badly to start the game and then started the second half the same way, bringing out the boo-birds. Two of his completions were shovel passes and another took a diving reception by a wide-open Miller. OSU's first three series generated one first down, but Meyer went back to him after Barrett came in outside the red zone (at the 31) and finished off the drive, making it look almost too easy. But when things got a little dicey in the second half, Meyer stuck with Barrett. The vertical passing game was non-existent, so, why, again is Jones playing at all? \nGRADE: C \nDEFENSIVE LINE \nJoey Bosa picked up where he left off last week when he had his first solo sack and four quarterback hurries. He led OSU with seven tackles and made life miserable for guard Brian Gaia. When Gaia wasn't getting manhandled by Bosa, he got caught holding LB Dante Booker to negate a 44-yard TD run by Saquon Barkley in the first quarter. The Lions came in having allowed the most sacks in the Big Ten and lived down to that billing as everybody up front for the Buckeyes got good push up front and kept Christian Hackenberg —a certain high draft pick once he gets away from his linemen — from having a big night. Adolphus Washington had two sacks, including a strip-sack that set up a gift touchdown in the final minutes. \nGRADE: B plus \nLINEBACKERS \nFor the first time in a while, a quarterback did not hurt the Buckeyes with his feet. But running back Saquan Barkley had a big night (194 yards on 26 carries) and had a 44-yard TD run wiped out by penalty. Joshua Perry left early with a sprained ankle, replaced by Dante Booker, and Perry's absence did not go unnoticed. MLB Raekwon McMillan was quieter than usual and it's time to send out a search party for Darron Lee. Where has he been? Backup Cam Williams made his presence known, only because he got called for \"targeting\" on a helmet-to-helmet hit. He'll go back to being forgotten since he has to sit out the first half next week. \nGRADE: C \nDEFENSIVE BACKS \nIt wasn't the secondary's finest hour, but a strong pass rush helped limit the damage. Gareon Conley was flagged for both pass interference and a late hit. Eli Apple missed a tackle on a 45-yard catch and run by Chris Godwin that set up a field goal on Penn State's first series and then got dragged 17 yards by Godwin on a 56-yard pass play that led to a touchdown in the third quarter. Vonn Bell had a nice open-field tackle that might have saved a touchdown, but also got flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct one play after the pass interference on Conley. A holding call on Penn State bailed out the defense on that series. \nGRADE: C \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nAnother big night for Cameron Johnston. Four of his five punts were downed inside the 20, including two inside the 5. Curtis Samuel came within a shoelace tackle of maybe breaking a kickoff return in the first quarter. Jack Willoughby kicked a 39-yard field goal, but if the Buckeyes had been one yard back would they have even attempted the kick? He's yet to make one this season from 40 yards or beyond. It's probably only a matter of time before it will be necessary. \nGRADE: A minus \nCOACHING \nJ.T. Barrett scored two touchdowns, accounted for four and directed an 8-play, 85-yard drive that put the game out of reach in the fourth quarter. He looks less and less like a red zone specialist and more and more like the quarterback, period. The way the game started with Cardale Jones at the controls, it looked like the \"Dark Night at the Shoe\" marketing ploy was going to backfire. Thanks to Barrett's heroics, fans won't be trashing their black T-shirts and Penn State fans won't be gobbling them up as souvenirs. Maybe we'll remember this dark night for Meyer seeing the light with his quarterbacks. Then maybe we can turn the focus back on the defense, which gave up big yards on the ground again and got hit with several 15-yard penalties, a sure sign of undisciplined play. \nGRADE: B 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LBMlYI MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:38:27.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
