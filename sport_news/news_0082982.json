Indianapolis-based journalist Dick Cady is a co-author.\nSI.com also reported about the book, and said the NCAA was notified of the allegations nearly a month ago, Since then, the NCAA has contacted multiple former Louisville recruits, including LSU freshman signee and former Louisville verbal commitment Antonio Blakeney who the NCAA has recently spoken with. LSU athletic director Joe Alleva declined comment when reached on Friday: \"I'm not saying a word,\" Alleva said.\nPowell said Andre McGee, a former Louisville player, was the point man that paid her for her staff's services. He was a graduate assistant under Rick Pitino from 2010-12 and director of basketball operations from 2012-14. He spent last year as an assistant coach at Missouri-Kansas City, working under former Pitino assistant Kareem Richardson.\nThe book alleges at the peak of the dormitory and off-campus entertainment more than $10,000 cash changed hands to Katina for supplying the women. This doesn't include the hundreds of $1 bills thrown at the dancers at each party by McGee, the recruits and players. Nor does it include the money paid to the women who had sex with the recruits afterward.\nThe book also alleges that over a four-year period, Powell brought women into the basketball dormitory through a side door to entertain players and recruits. Powell also says her dancers, which included her daughters, also entertained Louisville players at other locations off-campus. After the women danced for the players for an agreed-upon sum, Powell alleges that she would negotiate a second payment for the women to have sex with the athletes.\nThe book doesn't make any allegation that Louisville head coach Rick Pitino, who survived a sex-related extortion attempt that he announced in 2009, knew of McGee's activities or had knowledge of the women being provided to the players.\nFor the full story, read here .", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/news/new-book-makes-damaging-sexual-allegations-involving-louisville-basketball-202333537.html", "http://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/10/02/ncaa-investigation-louisville-escort"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:49:25.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
