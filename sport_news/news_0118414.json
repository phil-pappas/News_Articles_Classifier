The Sullivan Tigers lost only once in the regular season and started their playoff run with two dominating games that highlighted how well this experiment in cultural and athletic cohesion had gelled.\n\"We go to school together, play soccer every day together,\" said midfielder Sewar Al Bawi, 16, whose family escaped the violence of Iraq three years ago. \"That's how we learned how to communicate — how to speak soccer.\"\nSullivan is the neighborhood high school of Rogers Park, whose abundance of ethnic mutual aid societies and affordable rental housing has made it a longtime immigrant haven. Phil Nyden, director of Loyola University Chicago's Center for Urban Research and Learning, said Rogers Park is among the most diverse urban communities in the country and has absorbed newcomers with unusual equanimity.\n\"It's a comfortable place to be different,\" he said. \"That's not necessarily true if you live in other communities.\"\nSullivan tries to reinforce that harmony within a student body of 700 that speaks more than 40 languages. Principal Chad Adams said kids in the school's English as a second language program travel from class to class as a group, a routine that produces strong bonds among students from different countries.\nWe go to school together, play soccer every day together. That's how we learned how to communicate -- how to speak soccer. - Sewar Al Bawi, Sullivan midfielder Adams, a former college baseball player, said he has also tried to increase student engagement through sports, putting in a new weight room and replacing team uniforms.\n\"School spirit is just alive now,\" he said. \"The numbers on all our sports teams are growing.\"\nBut being a Sullivan athlete isn't easy. The soccer team practices on a lumpy patch of grass at Warren Park, more than a mile from campus, and one day last week, they had to share space with cricket players who occasionally batted a rock-hard ball into the boys' passing drills.\nBaburi, 32, ran the practice primarily in English, occasionally switching to Spanish. With players speaking languages from French to Swahili, he often had to demonstrate what he wanted, running the field in a stiff gait acquired from two knee surgeries.\nHe aspired toward a quick and fluid style of play that isn't common in the bruising world of American high school soccer. It helps to prevent injuries, he said, and creates a more elegant spectacle.\n\"Simple is beautiful, guys — look at nature,\" he preached when his players bunched up during a drill. \"Circles are beautiful. The moment you make a square, things get too complicated.\"\nBaburi learned that approach at the academy of KF Tirana, a professional club in Albania's capital. He envisioned becoming a pro player, too, until the unraveling of vast Ponzi schemes in 1997 caused his homeland to descend into anarchy.\n\"The biggest military base was near where I lived,\" he recalled. \"We had a flood of people coming from all over to get guns. There were a lot of people getting shot, killed. At that point, you decide: Do you want to stay and take a chance, or do you want to move on and try to make a better life?\"\nThe family fled to the U.S. and settled in Rogers Park. Baburi attended Sullivan and later played at Dominican University in River Forest before injuries ended his career. After graduation, he toyed with the idea of law school until the attorney glut convinced him that education would be a wiser path. He headed back to Sullivan in 2010 to become a dean and coach.\nThere, he had to deal with complexities that went beyond linguistics. He found that kids from different countries tend to have signature styles when it comes to soccer — Mexicans favor straightforward attacks, for example, while players from many African nations employ flashier moves — and it wasn't easy to get them to conform to his system.\nPlayer availability was another issue. Many of the teens had to work to help support their families, Baburi said, so he scheduled as few games as possible to help ease their schedules.\nOne thing Baburi's players did not lack was raw talent — the kind of touch that comes from kicking and dribbling a ball hour after hour without distraction. Some of the Tigers could coax the ball along as if it were adhered to their feet, pass with exquisite precision and lash curving shots into the net.\nAs for communication, the most talkative player on the field, goalkeeper Cesar Cristobal, said it wasn't a problem. He yelled commands in English and Spanish, and teammates who understood neither looked to their teammates to figure out what they were supposed to do.\nSullivan Tigers Brian Nguyen / Chicago Tribune Sullivan players react during the division semifinals.\nSullivan players react during the division semifinals.\n(Brian Nguyen / Chicago Tribune) \"That's why we all go to practice, so we can all play as a team,\" said Cristobal, 17, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 2. \"Little by little, we started to get together and learned how to play with each other.\"\nAfter two playoff wins, the bracket led the Tigers to the regional final against top seed North Shore Country Day, a private school in Winnetka. The Raiders, led by a former college coach from England, employed what Baburi called quintessential English tactics — rugged play, good organization and long passes meant to catch defenders napping.\nThe game proved to be an extreme clash of styles. The slower but more powerful Raiders looped passes down the sideline, trying to find space where their forwards could shoot. The fleet and flashy Tigers dribbled their way around defenders and flicked short passes with their toes and heels, trying to work their way into a clear chance.\n\"They want to play fancy, that's the problem,\" Baburi mused after a Sullivan forward lost the ball during a promising attack. \"They want to score a beautiful goal.\"\nEach team had a few near misses, but the game remained scoreless as it approached the end of regular time. That's when a North Shore player blasted a shot toward goal, striking a Sullivan defender's upper body inside the penalty area. The referee blew his whistle and pointed to the spot, calling a hand ball on the Tigers and awarding a penalty kick to the Raiders with 93 seconds to go.\nCristobal guessed correctly, diving to his left to block the shot of North Shore midfielder Ben Potter. But the ball bounced right back to Potter, who tapped it in the net for the deciding goal.\nIt was a brutal way for the season to end. Baburi raged against what he thought was an unfair call, but soon calmed and gathered his players for a tearful farewell. He had lost his position at Sullivan during Chicago Public Schools' summer cutbacks, becoming a full-time substitute known as a cadre. Though he had wanted to see out one more campaign with the Tigers, he wasn't sure where he might be coaching next.\n\"Keep your head up because you fought,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"To me, you guys are winners. That's what you are. Champions and winners.\"\nThe players remained silent. No matter their facility with English, they seemed to understand.\njkeilman@tribpub.com\nTwitter @JohnKeilman\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Soccer High Schools Europe Loyola University Chicago Dominican University Sports High School Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56244223/turbine/ct-sullivan-tigers-20151018", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56243fe1/turbine/ct-soccer-refugees-met-20151018"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:17:49.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
