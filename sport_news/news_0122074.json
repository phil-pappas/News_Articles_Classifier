Cunningham and Jenkins both attend Park Crossing High School in Montgomery, Ala. Thomas also lives in Montgomery, but he attends Sidney Lanier High School. \nThe offer to Cunningham is the most intriguing out of the group. DawgNation told you a couple of weeks ago that UGA is planning on signing two quarterbacks in the class of 2017. We also said that it’s likely UGA would look at bringing in a dual-threat quarterback because 2016 QB commit Jacob Eason and 2017 QB commit Bailey Hockman are both pro-style prospects. \nHowever, Cunningham told DawgNation that UGA is recruiting him as an athlete right now. That’s not stopping him from getting excited over his first offer. \n“My coach called me down to the office and when he does that, it’s normally about a new play that we are putting in,” Cunningham said. “He had some good news, though, and it was that UGA offered me, which is my first offer.” \n“They like my film and they said I have a lot of athleticism and really can’t wait to see me in action.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:53:27.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
