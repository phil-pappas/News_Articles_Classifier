Ahmed Musa could have won the game for CSKA late on but failed to convert a chance. \nThe big winner from the weekend’s fixtures is Zenit St. Petersburg, which had been struggling in the Russian league with just one win from its previous six games. \nThat poor form was swept aside in style with a 5-1 demolition of bottom-placed Anzhi Makhachkala on Saturday. Artyom Dzyuba finished with two goals, which Brazilian forward Hulk scored one and set up two more. \nZenit ends the weekend eight points off the lead but only two behind Lokomotiv, which occupies the second of the two Champions League qualifying places. \nIn other results, fourth-placed Spartak Moscow won an entertaining derby game against Dynamo Moscow 3-2 thanks to Quincy Promes’ stoppage-time winner. \nUral Yekaterinburg sits seventh after a 3-1 win over Amkar Perm, while FC Ufa rose out of the relegation zone with a 1-0 victory over Krylya Sovetov Samara. FC Krasnodar beat Rubin Kazan 2-1, and there was a 1-1 draw between Kuban Krasnodar and relegation-threatened Mordovia Saransk. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:29.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
