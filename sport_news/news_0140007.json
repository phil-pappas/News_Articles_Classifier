Yes. Ten touches vs. Redskins were not nearly enough. No. He is averaging 1.6 yards per carry behind a shaky line. View results \nThey can't consistently run the ball - the pass protection was pretty lousy, too - and it's having a snowball effect on the rest of the team. The Eagles are second to last in the league in yards per rush (2.8 average) and lead running back DeMarco Murray is averaging a woeful 1.6 yards per carry. \nAnd to make matters worse, the starting tackles are injured and their status for Sunday's must-win against the Saints is up in the air after they aggravated injuries in the loss at the Redskins. Jason Peters left in the first quarter with a quadriceps strain and Lane Johnson has medial collateral ligament and ankle sprains in his left leg, according to a league source. \nKelly said Monday that he thought he had the linemen to get the job done - as if he could say anything else? But when he was asked again about his confidence in the unit, he answered as if he were asked about possible replacements for Peters and Johnson. \n\"At this point in time, you have to\" have confidence in the team's linemen, Kelly said. \"There's not a bunch of O-linemen on the street. Everybody is on their different teams at this point in time. So you hope [Peters] is healthy this week and he can go. If not, then we've got to go with what we got.\" \nIn other words, Kelly made his bed with his offseason moves, or lack thereof, on the offensive line and there's no escaping it. Even a trade at this point - would the Bears be willing to move former Oregonian Kyle Long? - is unlikely to completely clean up the mess. \nThe root of the problems on the offensive line extends beyond Kelly's arrival two seasons ago. Howie Roseman may be reveling in the early-season struggles, but he owns part of the downward turn. Danny Watkins, anyone? \nBut Kelly had this past offseason to correct any of the previous regime's miscalculations, or at least start the process, and he did virtually nothing. He understandably released Todd Herremans and not as understandably waived Evan Mathis, but he signed nary a free agent before Mathis was cut in June and he didn't draft an offensive lineman, either. \n\"It's not a lesson learned,\" Kelly said when asked about Mathis. \"We were not going to renegotiate his contract. And again - I'll say it again - we were told by his agent, if we didn't renegotiate it, we weren't getting him back.\" \nMathis has said that he was planning to attend minicamp. He even sent The Inquirer a copy of his flight ticket. And remember, the Eagles still had Mathis under contract. The Seahawks' Kam Chancellor made similar contract demands and even held out for two regular-season games, but Pete Carroll stood his ground and the safety is back in the fold. \nMathis may have overvalued his worth, and he hasn't looked as dominant with the Broncos, but he was significantly better than Allen Barbre, and more important, a great fit in this offense. He would have helped, but there have been times when Anthony Munoz couldn't have stopped defenders that seemingly knew which plays were being run when and where. \n\"We've been doing things that we've been doing for a long time here - running inside zones, outside zones, sweep plays,\" Kelly said. \"So I think we understand what we're doing, but we're allowing sometimes too much penetration.\" \nKelly has dressed up some of his runs with different formations and more plays with the quarterback under center, but defenses are still keying on \"tells.\" The Eagles hadn't run the jet sweep in the first three weeks, but two went to Darren Sproles on Sunday. \nBoth times linebacker Will Compton could be seen anticipating a handoff as he motioned pre-snap, and each time he ran to the spot and blew up the play. \nThe outside zone run worked last week against the New York Jets, particularly with Ryan Mathews, but each time DeMarco Murray's number was called on Sunday he was diverted in the backfield by a defensive lineman who had a jump on the play. \nThere were some positive gains, but the sledding grew more difficult. And when the Eagles needed to put the Redskins away in the fourth quarter by killing time and generating first downs, they didn't have the manpower to muscle for tough yards. \n\"We were bottled up there a little bit,\" Kelly said. \"They had seven guys in a box a few times in there. . . . But we are still trying to kind of run the football.\" \nThe running backs share some of the blame, too. Kelly said that Mathews should have bounced outside on his first carry. \n\"So, it's not just one thing,\" Kelly said, \"it's a combination of a couple things.\" \nA lack of talent and a detectable scheme are two pretty big things.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:11:43.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
