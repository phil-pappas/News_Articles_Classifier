Having earned a sizable following for its fried chicken biscuit sandwiches in Lakeview, the restaurant has outgrown its Irving Park Road location and has expanded to a second store in the River West neighborhood.\nThis is good news for a downtown neighborhood where sourcing fancy bespoke fried chicken is spotty and random. What I’m sayin' is there’s no ground zero, no municipal center of gravity for fried chicken in Chicago — there’s Big Jones (Andersonville), Smalls Smoke Shack (Albany Park), Take Me Out (Pilsen), Dell Rhea Chicken Basket (Willowbrook) — map the plot points of good versions in this city, and it’ll look like a drunkard’s dartboard.\nThe Roost Kevin Pang/Chicago Tribune The Roost Carolina Kitchen opened its River West location on Oct. 1.\nThe Roost Carolina Kitchen opened its River West location on Oct. 1.\n(Kevin Pang/Chicago Tribune) This new location (455 N. Milwaukee Ave.), which opened Oct. 1, is both larger and smaller than its first store. Compared with its 30-seat Lakeview location, indoor seating space at River West is tighter, with just 10 bar stools (though there are ample outdoor seats). But the kitchen is twice as large, which explains why owner and North Carolina-native Joe Scroggs plans to expand the downtown catering and corporate lunch business here.\nOn the River West menu, you’ll still find Roost's breakfast biscuit sandwiches, with Southern-inspired sides (mac and cheese, peach cobbler, etc.) the rest of the day. The chicken biscuits here ride on the Nashville hot chicken trend that peaked several years ago, and I’m happy to report it’s not a passing fad. The buttermilk biscuits are as good as ever, their interior as fluffy and rich as brioche.\nWhat I wanted was a closer inspection of the bone-in fried chicken ($6 for quarter bird, $10 for half). While I won’t be as effusive as my colleague Jeff Ruby at Chicago magazine, I do think this fried chicken is quite good. When critiquing fried chicken, emphasis tends to be placed on the exterior crust, and The Roost’s leans more flaky and shattering than the sturdy crunch of, say, Big Jones’ .\n75 deep fried foods, from pizza and burgers to scorpions and jelly beans, you can deep fry almost anything.\nWith the whole fried chicken, you'll find three spiciness levels, anchored on the far right with the Nashville Hot that I once described as \"the color of the sun from Cormac McCarthy’s 'Blood Meridian.'” The difference between this and the next level down, simply notated as \"spicy,\" is that the Nashville Hot gets basted with a hot chili oil that tingles with both cayenne and a sweet, peppery smokiness — nowhere near the doubled-over burning you'd experience at, say, Prince's Hot Chicken in Nashville. The Roost's midlevel \"spicy\" comes without that slick of chili oil, and it bore a spice level that's easygoing for most heat aficionados.\nOn the nonspicy end is an exterior bearing a noticeable herbaceousness, with celery seed and rosemary flecked throughout the lacy batter. Even so, Scroggs said, rather than focusing on that exterior skin, much of The Roost's attention is on the flavor of the interior meat.\n“The only thing we do that’s unique is we keep the chicken in the brine until the second we fry,” Scroggs said. Indeed, that minimum 24-hour brine gives the chicken meat a snow-white sheen. No one will ever accuse this fried chicken of being dry, of this I’m sure.\nkpang@tribpub.com\nTwitter @pang\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-4e840a51/turbine/sns-viral-fried-pictures-002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-4e840a55/turbine/sns-viral-fried-pictures-001", "http://www.theroostcarolinakitchen.com/", "http://www.roadfood.com/Restaurant/Reviews/4613/princes-hot-chicken-shack", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561819ec/turbine/ct-the-roost-carolina-kitchen-opens-in-river-west-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561819ee/turbine/ct-the-roost-carolina-kitchen-opens-in-river-w-001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54bfd9ac/turbine/sns-viral-fried-pictures", "http://twitter.com/pang", "http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2014/Who-Has-the-Best-Fried-Chicken-in-Chicago/"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:22:01.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
