With the loss, the Rams fall to 2-5 in WSL play, while the Skiers improve to 4-3 in WSL play. For the Rams, Grace Brown led the way offensively, racking up six kills. She added 14 digs and two aces. Madilyn Kuhl did a great job of keeping the Rams alive on defense, picking up seven digs defensively, while adding four kills and an ace offensively. Dani Minor added five kills for the Rams. But it was Lily Ramos who stood out for the Rams against Aspen, turning in a game-high 34 digs in the losing effort. Despite strong performances from key individual players, the Rams came up short to a tough Aspen team on the road. “The Skiers did a good job of preparing for us this week,” Rams head coach Jennifer Dority said. “They were ready to play hard, and they were scrappy and smart. We just made a few unforced errors that cost us the match.” With four days off to prepare for the 3A Western Slope League tournament in Grand Junction on Friday and Saturday, the Rams should be well prepared to hit the road. 3A boys soccer state playoff matchups announced Finishing the season strong with four wins in its final five games, the Coal Ridge Titans boys soccer team is heading to the state playoffs as the No. 18 seed, where it’ll take on the Denver Christian Crusaders on Friday, Oct. 30, at Liberty Common.
