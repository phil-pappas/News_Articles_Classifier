The Chandigarh Beopar Mandal and the market associations of Sectors 15, 19 and 22 took this decision to avoid inconvenience to the public. Yesterday, Home Secretary Anurag Aggarwal had turned down the MC decision to keep parking areas in the markets of Sectors 15, 19 and 22 vehicle-free. Beopar Mandal president Charanjiv Singh said they were against the MC proposal not to allow parking of vehicles in the parking lots. As the UT Administration had considered the traders’ genuine demand, they would also deploy private security guards in the parking lots to avoid traffic congestion, he said. He said the market associations of Sectors 19 C and D, and 22 D had already deployed private guards to manage the parking lots. These associations were managing these lots for the past several years, he said. The Municipal Corporation today advised traders to park their vehicles in alternative parking sites such as schools, community centres and dispensaries, identified by the MC in Sectors 15, 19 and 22. On the MC advice, the Beopar Mandal agreed that the traders would park their vehicles at alternative parking sites or at the rear side of their shops. MC yet to decide on number of stalls After the Home Secretary’s order, the MC had started the process to restrict the number of stalls in different markets. However, the MC is yet to fix the limit for setting up stalls. Who will manage alternative parking lots? While the MC has identified alternative parking lots in various sectors, no decision has been taken on who will manage these lots. The MC had asked traders to manage these lots, but they did not agree. The traffic police and the civic body were also at loggerheads over managing the alternative parking sites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:19:08.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
