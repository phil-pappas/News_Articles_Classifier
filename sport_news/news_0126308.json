Nor is there an end in sight for single murders by gun; nor for suicides by gun; nor for deaths and injuries from accidental shootings.\nOn the same day as this UpFront article, it was reported in the New York Times that in the U.S., there are more gun deaths of preschoolers – 82 in 2013 – than police officers in the line of duty – 27 in 2013. Isn’t it time to stop the madness?\nGun violence is America is a public health issue of immense proportions. Who among (s) does not know of a family member, friend or acquaintance affected by gun violence? Our country is an international embarrassment when it comes to protecting the safety of its own citizens. We must do better.\nCertainly we must strive to improve the care of the mentally ill and have more effective background checks before purchasing a gun. But we must do far more.\nNo American citizen needs to own weapons of war capable of inflicting massive destruction in a few seconds. A mandatory waiting period or requirement for gun safety training can reduce deaths from crimes of passion, including suicides, for those who do not already own a gun. Gun registration should be at least as comprehensive as we now have for automobiles. And funding for research on gun violence should not be stifled by legislation passed by our elected officials who receive financial support from gun lobbyists.\nWe all have a right to enjoy going to a movie theater or school without the threat of death or injury by someone who should not be in possession of a lethal weapon. If you care about your health and welfare, and that of your family and friends, act now.\nSupport legislators who care more about public health than protecting their campaign contributions from gun lobbyists. How much money have your representatives accepted from gun lobbyists, and what do they owe in return?\nE. MICHAEL LEWIECKI, MD\nAlbuquerque\nOur valued freedom comes with costs\nTHE LIBERAL person’s utopian viewpoint is always the same – there are some smart people who can fix everything if we will just let them take power so laws can be put in place.\nThere’s always one problem. This isn’t utopia and not all people follow laws. We can’t eradicate poverty – even Jesus said the poor would always be with us – and we can’t make “safer” cars, guns, knives, rocks, hammers – you get my drift. We live in a fallen, imperfect world and we are called to simply be the best responsible people we can be.\nWe can’t solve all issues for people who have freedom to make their own choices – choices we may or may not agree with. These mass killers are either mentally ill, very evil or swayed by an ideology that isn’t compatible with freedom. It was decided by the government in the 1960s to toss all the mentally ill onto the streets for their own “freedom” and thus we have this problem.\nEvil will always be with us – except for those who deny it exists. We can keep an eye on ideologies, but when we speak up, we are called some kind of “-phobe.”\nSo there you have it – freedom comes with costs. I wish we could make a perfect world, but those who have tried in history succeeded in killing millions who would not follow their paths. Better to live with freedom.\nNANCY CAPELS\nAlbuquerque\nRepeal law that protects gun industry\nFOLLOWING YET another mass shooting, there will be renewed calls to impose new gun laws. This is a proposal to repeal a gun law. Congress needs to repeal the 10-year-old law that protects the gun industry from the often fatal consequences of its manufacturing and marketing decisions.\nProduct liability law is designed to encourage safer products and to provide injured people with a meaningful remedy. The law treats dangerous products differently from other products, for the simple reason they are dangerous. Guns are designed to kill – if you own a gun for target practice, get a BB gun. Merely pointing a gun at someone usually has its intended effect.\nIn 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which gives the gun industry legal immunity from being sued in both state and federal courts. The result of Congress deciding to give the gun industry a pass means injured people and their families are denied meaningful access to the courts. Access to the courts is enshrined in the Constitution. The Seventh Amendment is no less important than the Second Amendment.\nIt is time for Congress to repeal a law that protects one industry and that violates the public’s constitutional right of access to the courts.\nJEFFREY L. BAKER\nAlbuquerque\nSpeak up, speak out on gun violence\nANOTHER SENSELESS shooting … . This time in Oregon. Not long ago there was one right here in southern New Mexico.\nSoon another state will be in the spotlight. What will another state police officer say about the inevitable incident coming to their state? What will another mayor or governor say, not if it comes to another state but when? If you don’t believe that, then think again.\nWinthrop Quigley (“No end in sight for mass shootings in our nation,” Oct. 4) stated there have been 294 mass shootings in the U.S. in 2015. So far. With 300 million guns in the U.S. what can we expect will happen tomorrow and the next day and the next?\nIf we just throw up our hands and say “oh, well,” surely more loss of life will occur. More families will be ruined. If we just sit here and “hope and pray” it doesn’t happen to our family, will we ever really be safe? If we continue to let the NRA buy our representatives’ silence on the matter, can we blame anybody but ourselves when our own loved ones are killed?\nHere is what we can do. Don’t buy guns. Educate your family members about how to recognize people with mental illness. Teach them to speak up and tell someone if they think a person is acting or talking in a threatening way.\nHold your legislators accountable for their inaction on this issue. Write them, call them, tell them you expect action from them because action can be taken at both the state and federal level to stop guns from getting in the hands of people who will do harm. Tell members of NRA that they too have a responsibility to act justly to protect all Americans from senseless gun violence.\nAnd finally, stand up and be heard. Speak about this issue everywhere you go. Donate to and get involved in organizations trying to move the needle on this issue. Because putting names up on a wall and just hoping it doesn’t happen again, or at least not in your town, is not enough. Frankly, it never has been.\nCAROLYN OGREN\nAlbuquerque\nTreat gun registration like those of vehicles\nI THINK IT is perfectly obvious that any vehicle driven by an insane or irresponsible person can be a lethal weapon. That is why we have liability insurance and we register our vehicles.\nWhy should guns be any different? If guns were registered by owners, who paid for liability insurance, we could expect thefts to be reported and any gun violence could be covered by an insurance policy. Registered owners would be required to keep their weapons away from children, bullets, etc., and would be liable for their misuse.\nIf we could only require this paperwork, responsibility would fall on the gun owner, not the parents, police or child who handled it.\nI believe it is time to make politicians responsible for their votes!\nMICHELE BUCHANAN\nAlbuquerque\nQuit protecting our elected officials\nTHE SENATE IS safe from being shot by a crazy man and so is the House. While the public pays the bills for all these guards to protect Congress, we are sitting ducks out here thanks to George W. Bush. President Bush signed a bill that even prevents us from suing gun manufacturers after our family member is shot.\nLet’s take a vote to not guard anyone until the public has been protected. From now on all doors to the Senate chamber and the House of Representatives should be wide open, just like our churches, schools and shopping centers. It should remain that way until this situation is remedied by strengthening gun laws.\nMembers of Congress are our employees. We pay their salary even though the gun lobby and National Rifle Association pay them not to do anything.\nJEAN M.
