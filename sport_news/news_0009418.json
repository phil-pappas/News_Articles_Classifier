He subsequently planned to play at Oregon but ultimately landed at Ohio State. \nOhio State associate athletic director for communications, Dan Wallenberg, told Yahoo! Sports that the school is unconcerned about Lyle's eligibility. \n\"It does not affect us or JaQuan at all,” Wallenberg told Yahoo! Sports. \"We've been told, and are pretty confident, this is not something we need to worry about.\" \nThe NCAA has also already interviewed former Louisville recruit Antonio Blakeney, according to sources. Blakeney is now at LSU. What he told the NCAA remains unclear. \nLouisville's Rick Pitino has denied any knowledge of the 22 \"shows\" Powell claims she put on for players or recruits. McGee has not spoken publicly since the book's release. \nMeantime, WDRB.com reported Thursday afternoon that a former Louisville basketball player has \"given investigators a version of events that indicates strippers were in the players' dorm on at least one occasion,\" according to a source. The report did not name the former player but did state that it's somebody who was \"mentioned in the book.\" ©2015 by 10TV.com. All rights reserved.
