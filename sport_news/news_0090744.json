However, Patrice Evra was finding space on the left flank and he nearly set up the opener in the eighth minute.\nThe former Manchester United defender had time to stop and look up before sending in a pinpoint cross, which Morata headed just wide of the right post under pressure.\nJuventus was also trying its luck from distance and a Hernanes snapshot flew narrowly wide of the the left upright from 30 yards.\nPaulo Dybala went even closer in the 17th minute when he curled an effort millimeters wide of the far left post from the edge of the area.\nSevilla was content to sit back and counterattack but posed little threat to the Juventus defense.\nJuventus should have taken the lead in the 35th following a great cut-back from the byline by Sami Khedira to Dybala but the Argentinian slipped.\nThe hosts did go in front four minutes from halftime when Juan Cuadrado, who was causing Sevilla problems on the right flank, cut back from the byline to Andrea Barzagli, who crossed for Morata to head into the bottom right corner.\nThe last player to score in five Champions League matches for Juventus was club legend Alessandro del Piero. It was also Morata's seventh goal in his past nine games in the competition.\nDybala had a great chance to double Juve's lead straight after the break as he muscled his way into the area but Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico got down swiftly to block his shot.\nThe 21-year-old went close again shortly after the hour, when he was tripped by Steven N'Zonzi right on the edge of the area, but his free-kick was too central and Rico was able to comfortably gather.\nDybala played a part in the second goal, winning back possession in a tussle with two Sevilla defenders and passing across to Zaza. The Italy forward had fresh legs after coming off the bench seven minutes earlier and he sprinted clear from near the halfway line before slotting past Rico.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
