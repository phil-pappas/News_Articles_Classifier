The Yankees have the largest at $216 million, or more than three times that of the Astros.\nThe Astros are shiny and new, a young team just starting to scratch its potential. The Yankees are getting old and looking a little worn.\nHouston lost more than 100 games three years in a row from 2011-13. The last time the Yankees lost 100 games was in 1912, 103 years ago.\nThe Yankees have won 25 World Series. The Astros have won .... did I mention the Astros are shiny and new?\nThe wild card round is baseball’s ultimate crapshoot. You work hard all season, battle through a 162-game grind to earn a spot among the final 10 and, ultimately, your fate can hang on one bad pitch, one error, one spectacular defensive gem or one mighty swing.\nThe common thread for these two teams is that each led its division — the Yankees in the AL East and the Astros in the AL West — for a large portion of the season. Houston led the AL West for 139 days but fell out of that lofty spot for good on September 15. The Yankees led the East for 100 days this season, overtaken finally by the Blue Jays on August 25.\nNeither team had a winning record in the September-October period. The Yankees finished with 15 wins in their final 33 games, while the Astros won just 13 of 30.\n\"I have been on teams that have played extremely well going in and you don’t get it done and vice a versa, so Tuesday is a new day,\" Yankee manager Joe Girardi said. “We wake up and it’s a new day and we are where we want to be, we are in the playoffs. I think the guys feel good about that and they will be ready Tuesday.’’\nEven though both teams are sending their aces to the mound tonight, there are questions that both Dallas Keuchel and Masahiro Tanaka have to answer.\nThe good news for Cy Young candidate Keuchel and the Astros is that Keuchel has dominated the Yankees this season. Really dominated them. He’s tossed 16 scoreless innings at the Bronx Bombers, allowing nine hits, one walk, while striking out 21.\nThe bad news is that he’s coming to this start on just three days’ rest, the first time in his career that he will pitch without four days’ rest between starts. Pitchers are, in general, creatures of habit and nobody can say for sure how Keuchel will react on short rest.\n“He’s one of the best,” Alex Rodriguez said about Keuchel. “But this time of year whether it’s Keuchel, (Zack) Greinke, (Clayton) Kershaw or (David) Price, they’re all brand names. You have to beat them all one by one.”\nThe cautionary tale for the Astros is that this game is on the road, where Keuchel was not nearly as invincible as he was at Minute Maid Park. At home, the bearded lefty was 15-0 with a 1.46 ERA. On the road, he went 5-8 with a 3.77 ERA. In his one appearance at Yankee Stadium though, he did dominate, shutting out the Yanks over seven innings on three hits with nine strikeouts.\nThe home/road conundrum has been a problem for the Astros all year. They ended the season tied with Toronto for the best home record but they also own the worst road record in the league.\nTanaka, given that he is pitching with a ticking time bomb in his right elbow, has had a very good season. He gritted his way through 24 starts and, even though his overall numbers were not spectacular (154 innings, 3.51 ERA), he was tough when he had to be. The immediate problem for the Yankees is that Tanaka has made only one start since Aug. 18 when he came down with a slight hamstring pull.\nThat one start, on September 30 against the Red Sox, was an abbreviated five-inning stint in which he allowed five hits and four earned runs, so he is something of an uncertain commodity coming into the biggest game of the last three seasons for the Yankees, who last appeared in the playoffs in 2012.\n“There are no limitations,” Girardi said. “He’s had a pretty good year. He threw a stinker the last time out, but I still feel good about it.”\nTanaka faced the Astros once this season, on June 27 in Houston, and he allowed six runs on seven hits in five innings but wasn’t part of the decision in what turned out to be a 9-6 Yankees win.\nThe surprising news that CC Sabathia is heading to alcohol rehab on the eve of the playoffs is a distraction for the Yankees no doubt, but pro sports teams deal with health and injury problems constantly over the course of a season. This is no different.\nOn offence, the young Astros are a free-swinging bunch who finished just two home runs behind the league-leading Blue Jays. The Jays hit 232 and the Astros 230. The Astros did not have a 30-homer man but they did have five players — Chris Carter, Carlos Correa, Luis Valbuena, Evan Gattis and Colby Rasmus — who hit between 22 and 27. Overall, the Astros had 11 players hit in double figures in hmers.\nAs the Kansas City Royals and San Francisco Giants both proved last year, winning the wild-card round can lead to some pretty amazing things. Which ev er of these two teams moves on, could provide an early test for the defending AL champion Royals in the Division Series.\nWho Could? Who Might?\nFor Houston\n1. Evan Gattis\nGattis has hit Yankees pitching at a .375 clip over his career with four homers and a 1.207 OPS. He can go deep at any moment, foul line, to foul line.\n2. Carlos Correa\nThe probable AL rookie of the year has limited exposure to the Yankees but he’s had eight hits in 23 at-bats. His one home run came against Masahiro Tanaka.\n3. Jose Altuve\nHe’s a thorn in every pitcher’s side, an absolute pest who can hit any pitch, no matter where it’s located. Like Correa, Altuve’s only HR vs. the Yankees came against Tanaka.\nFor New York\n1. Alex Rodriguez\nThe Yankees are left-handed-hitting dominant but Rodriguez is the biggest danger from the right side that Keuchel will have to deal with. Make a mistake and A-Rod will make him pay.\n2. Chase Headley\nSwitch-hitter Headley did some of his best work against lefties, hitting .283 with three homers and 24 RBI from the right side of the plate. His gap-to-gap power could be a key for the Yankees.\n3. Carlos Beltran\nSwitch-hitter Beltran may be 38 but you don’t want to make a mistake to him, especially in the postseason. He has hit 16 homers in 180 postseason at-bats.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nMLB PLAYOFFS\nYouthful Astros take on veteran Yankees in AL wild card matchup\nBy Ken Fidlin , Toronto Sun First posted: Monday, October 05, 2015 08:13 PM EDT | Updated: Monday, October 05, 2015 08:19 PM EDT\nYou could dissect the 10 teams who have made it to Major League Baseball’s post-season tournament and not find two more dissimilar outfits than the New York Yankees and the Houston Astros.\nJust one of them will survive after Tuesday night’s American League wild card game at Yankee Stadium.\nFor starters, the Astros have the smallest payroll in the AL at just over $70 million.
