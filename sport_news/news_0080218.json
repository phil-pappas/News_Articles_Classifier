Most of the time I don't have a problem with it. It's pure emotion and sports needs more of it. I'm talking about the bat flip which is often frowned upon in baseball as showing up the other team. \nJose Ramirez of the Indians flipped his bat after hitting a home run in the final week of the season against the Twins. The Twins were still in the playoff chase. Ramirez flipped it at their bench it angered the Twins. I can see why they were upset. \nLast night, Game 5, Jays and Rangers, and there was a bat flip for the ages. After hitting what would be the game winning three-run home run, Jose Bautista flipped his bat. Looking at the moment, he had just given his team the lead in a controversial Game 5 with the winner moving on to the ALCS. This was a do or die playoff game. Huge moment in sports history and he showed his raw emotion. I love it. That's what baseball needs in a moment like this. A guy showing what he's truly feeling. He was pumped up. He got the entire ballpark pumped up. I was pumped up. \nIs this really any different than LeBron beating his chest after a big play, or a football player dancing after a sack, or even Kirk Gibson fist pumping after his legendary home run in the 1988 World Series? \nNo. Bautista deserves his moment to flip the bat. Sports needs to keep the true and raw emotions in the game. It's what makes sports exciting. \nTweet me your thoughts @johnWKYC.
