The 27th-seeded Cardinals, a wild-card entry from the Coastal Conference, finish 10-8. “We were missing a lot of players (including two seniors),” JHS coach Destiny Ma’ave Kuewa said. “We worked hard to try to work around that, but Hunt played a great game.” Down 2-0, the Cardinals jumped out to a 7-1 lead in the third set and was up 10-4 before Hunt (18-6), seeded No. 6, rallied to go up 15-14 and was within a point of sweeping the match (24-20) when Jacksonville came back. A kill by Allexa Mitchels and a hitting error by Hunt finished JHS’ rally to force a fourth set, which was all Hunt.

The Pirates were seeded No. 32 in the field of 32 teams in the East. “Cedar Ridge is a good team, but I thought we shot ourselves in the foot early by not doing what we needed to do, offensively and defensively,” Swansboro coach Kim Miller said. “We gave them a lot of free balls and they made us pay. But I’m proud that we didn’t give up.” Alex Watkins had 16 digs for the Pirates.

Chrisitan Athletic Association title in Elizabeth City. JCA finishes the season 8-3-1. “I’m real proud of the boys’ effort,” JCA coach Paul Albaugh said. “They didn’t give up. They were relentless on the field.” And the future looks bright as well. “I’m excited because I have a very young team,” he said. “I’m only losing two seniors.” Up 1-0 at halftime, JCA also saw Trinity tie it up, but goalkeeper Jeremy Rice stopped a penalty kick before Campos extended JCA’s lead off an assist from Garrett Mantlo.
