The Portsmouth High School football team hits a fork in the road of sorts on Friday when it travels to Londonderry, a battle between 1-3 teams that could each insert its name back into the Division I playoff race with a win. “If we beat them, I’d say that would eliminate them,” said Portsmouth coach Brian Pafford. “They’ve got some tough games coming up. But who doesn’t?” The Clippers finally have a little wind in their sails after getting their first win last week against Spaulding, 42-28. It wasn’t a flawless game, but did feature a quick 21-0 lead and a strong second half, sandwiched around a lackluster second quarter that let the Red Raiders get back in the game. “We finally took our head out of our rear-ends and started played well again,” summed up quarterback Cody Graham. Graham, just four games into his sophomore season, has emerged as a bright spot and building block for the future, no matter which fork this season takes. He’s completed 73 percent of his passes (91-of-125) for 1,092 yards, 11 touchdowns and six interceptions. Against Spaulding, he made a game’s worth of good decisions, showing patience in the pocket, and rolling out and taking what the defense gave him, rushing for 116 yards on 10 carries. Christian Peete, Shon Parham and Jake Lorenz have emerged as his favorite targets, while 6-foot-5 Ryan Edney and 6-foot-4 Joey Glynn are superb safety nets. “He had more space and more time to throw the ball because our line’s improving,” said senior tailback Joey Auger. “That’s really going to be helpful to have. We have some kids coming back, some upperclassmen.” “They throw the ball extremely well,” said Londonderry coach Jimmy Lauzon. “It’s actually really impressive. I watched film in the offseason and thought they threw the ball really well last year, but that no way they’d throw it that well this year (with a new quarterback). But they have.” Against Londonderry, Graham could be under fire more than usual. The blitz-happy Lancers can run to the ball quickly and will try to cancel out the Clippers’ athleticism with their own playmakers on defense. “They like to come hard from the perimeter,” noted Pafford. A Portsmouth defense that was run through in losses to Pinkerton (54-14) and Timberlane (38-18) gained some traction against Spaulding. Inside linebackers Ben Barba and David Feals, who are critical in stopping the run game, got themselves into position to make tackles better; making all of them is the next step. “Like us, they want to spread you out as much as they can and try to create a seam for their athletes to make a play,” said Pafford. Those athletes include quarterback Jake Stevens, who will get the start with Ben Johnson suspended for the first half; tough runner David Wiedenfeld; and receiver Nick Donnelly. “We like to pride ourselves on running the ball,” said Lauzon. “Obviously, we’re not where we were last year, but we’re getting the average up. The holes are there; they’re just not sustained.” Like the Clippers can lament the season-opening game at Merrimack that got away, the Lancers know they could be better than 1-3 as well. They took Exeter to the wire in a 28-20 loss in Week 3, and were also competitive against Pinkerton (35-20) last week. In short, both teams see Friday as a winnable game; for the Clippers, that would mean a win streak. “We were definitely more positive (this week),” said Auger. “If we put in the effort and the hard work and perform, it can be a great game. I’m excited to get out there.” Find a way to beat the Lancers, to keep their spread offense from running wild, to finish off enough drives in what could be a high-scoring game, and the Clippers’ chances for a return to the Division I playoffs get a boost. Lose this game, and their role for the rest of October becomes finalized: spoilers.
