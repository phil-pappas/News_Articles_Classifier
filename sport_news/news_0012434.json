Edgy amusement, sure, since Pryor was known for his profane routines, his racial epithets and the close proximity of comedy and personal pain. But laughs nonetheless. Pryor did not get to be the consummate comic's comic, and a colossal influence on so many that followed him, without splitting a few sides.\nI barely cracked a smile, though, at \"Unspeakable.\"\nVery few people did at the Broadway Playhouse on Tuesday night, despite a benevolent lobby atmosphere thanks to the Cubs' playoff win a few minutes before curtain. A good number of folks did not return to the show after intermission. A few around me exited while Act 1 was in progress. Despite a very provocative performance from James Murray Jackson Jr., in the title role, \"Unspeakable\" is very hard to take.\nI don't mean that entirely as a pejorative. Although billed as a \"fantasia\" and unauthorized by the Pryor estate, \"Unspeakable,\" also co-written by Jackson, a New Jersey-based actor, is a biographical take. It is cliched to observe that many of the best comedians had rough childhoods and troubled personal lives in adulthood, but to say that Pryor was dealt a tough deck does not give full credit to the nature of the cards. He was born in Peoria and grew up in a brothel owned by his grandmother. He was abused and abandoned, and became an abuser and abandoner himself. In 1980, he set himself on fire after drinking alcohol while freebasing cocaine. And it was downhill from there.\nIn 2006, I reviewed Rain Pryor's solo show about life with her dad. She offered ample evidence of his interest in drugs and his disinterest in parenting. And she was there.\nI think Jackson's intention was to home in on something else I remember about that Rain Pryor show — the sense that Pryor lived a life at the center of a nightmarish carnival of his own drug-fueled construction. I remember Rain Pryor, in her show, describing her dad's funeral as \" 'The Last Comic Standing' Meets Disney on Crack,\" which is also perhaps as good a description as any of the milieu of \"Unspeakable.\" An attempt is being made here to take the audience inside Pryor's drug-addled mind. And although, in a curtain call Tuesday, Jackson said the show's main aim was to \"do right\" by its late subject, there certainly is no attempt made to paint over any of the man's deficiencies. This is about as far from a hagiography as it is possible to go, which took some guts.\nWhat is 'Unspeakable' about Richard Pryor?

As Russell explained it to me, audiences developed very intimate relationships with comedians whose routines were recorded...\n(Chris Jones) Jackson's point of view is that Pryor's comedy had a closer relationship with the tragic than that of any other comedian of his (or maybe any) generation. In essence, it asserts that if you grow up semi-abandoned in a brothel then you are likely to grow up with no boundaries, sexual or otherwise. And if you get a little money and power, well, it only makes everything worse.\nYou get that from \"Unspeakable,\" although the script is a mess and the production values are limited enough that the show would be better off with just a black curtain and a few lights. I could not decide if we were in a kind of real-time drama located somewhere inside Pryor's head, or if some of the direct address from the other characters was intended to be narration or some approximation of a Greek chorus. It was never clear. Very little was clear, actually. The show, which is conceived, directed and co-written by Rod Gailes OBC, uses 10 actors; E. Faye Butler plays Pryor's grandmother, in unstinting fashion. But everyone is a shadow in the mind of the main man.\nJackson does not have the rights to Pryor's comedy material, which probably explains why there is so little stand-up in the show. This is a crippling problem, of course, since Pryor was fundamentally a stand-up comedian, known for his routines. That is why the audience likely is buying a ticket — at the very least, this is how most of us know or recall Pryor. Yet you could leave the theater after more than two hours without any sense of how or why Pryor connected with fans, a relationship that cut across race and generation. It is bizarre that a show landed in a venue of this size and prominence without someone noting that maybe this was worth some consideration, or that Jackson needed to pen some faux-Pryor routines.\nThere is only so much freebasing, or sexual abuse, that an audience cares to watch, especially if the subject is (a) deceased and (b) widely admired for his art. \"Unspeakable\" is right to offer Pryor uncensored. But that does not mean wallowing in the mud.\nYou can see some moments of what this show, much better suited to a small club, could become. There's an interesting and provocative monologue early in the show probing Pryor's fascination with Bill Cosby as the un-Pryor of his day. Or so everyone thought. That has many layers now. Similarly, a couple of the scenes in Berkeley, Calif., where Pryor was the most unpredictable of radio hosts, have resonance. In a few other spots, the show deftly focuses on the horror of being an addict with everyone on your payroll and no one speaking the truth.\nJackson's performance is, in fact, a very potent and impressive piece of acting, although the show is such a mess that few will see that as clearly as the performance deserves. He understands the improvisational genius of his subject. And — more importantly — Jackson gets the way Pryor did not so much deliver material as allow that material to inhabit his body. Pryor was merely a vessel for Pryor. Jackson makes that work. No mean feat, that, in this kind of chaos.\nOne thing this show achieves is to remind us just how much Pryor suffered, and how much suffering he caused in return.\nBut, really, suffering is the entire Pryor legacy? That's a night out for an audience? Not if you want to sell tickets.\nPryor's contribution to the culture was unfiltered commentary and sharp observation. He knew how to market himself, how to leaven the pain and hostility with sweet surrender to the microphone.\nWhatever was going on in the man's head and soul, people paid good money to hear what he had to say. Gigs flowed to an addict. Why? Because of a talent that does not deserve to go unspoken.\nChris Jones is a Tribune critic.\ncjones5@tribpub.com\nTwitter@ChrisJonesTrib\n\"Unspeakable\" - 2 stars\nWhen: Through Oct. 25\nWhere: Broadway Playhouse, 175 E.
