The Blue Eagles opened the season with nine straight losses, dropping many of the games by four and five goals. But Head Coach John Tocci then went to a pair of new formations, and suddenly his team began playing better. The Blue Eagles had posted two wins and a tie heading into Tuesday’s game against Duxbury. No longer were they pushovers in the potent Patriot League. “We made some formation changes that have put the kids in a better situation to be successful,” Tocci said. “The kids are really buying into it. They have really bonded. They have a different look in their eyes. They’re hustling and working harder. The new formations have helped. They have surprised our opponents.” The Blue Eagles opened the season playing a classic 4-4-2 or 3-5-2 formation. But Tocci began experimenting in their ninth game against Pembroke, changing to a 2-3-3-2, which effectively means playing two groups of five up front and on the backline. “It really slowed down Pembroke. We made a couple of mistakes that cost us two goals, but it made a difference,” Tocci said. The Blue Eagles then played Hanover to a 1-1 tie and followed up with wins over Middleboro (3-1) and Quincy (2-0). The Blue Eagles lost 5-0 the first time they faced Quincy this season. “The formations totally change coverages for our opponents,” Tocci said. “The midfielders only have two guys to cover and they can’t figure out how to do it. We’re also getting more offense because of the change.” Sophomore Dan Rodrigues has four goals to lead the team, including scores in both of their wins. Sophomore Zach Greeley has three goals. Sophomore Tijs Kroeze and junior Eliomar Dutra also scored in the win against Middleboro, while senior Shawn McIver tallied in the Quincy triumph. Dutra and junior Thalles Nunes have been instrumental on defense for the Blue Eagles. “Those two have been our workhorses,” Tocci said. Sophomore goalie Monty Gray has given up some goals, but Tocci said his play has been outstanding. “He has been lights out,” he said. “Some of the games were 4-0 losses, but they easily could have been 8-0 or 9-0. In our two wins and a tie, he made some saves that he had no business making.” After a tough beginning, the season has taken on a new look for the Blue Eagles.

We want to fight hard in every game.” By Rob Duca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:32:46.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
