JILLIAN BECK/BASTROP ADVERTISER “For me, it’s rooted in awareness for our youth,” Ruiz said. “It’s a way for them to give back.”\nProceeds from the event will go toward creating a fund to purchase a 3D-sonogram machine for the Pregnancy Resource Center in Bastrop.\nThe run coincided with the church’s “Respect for Life” theme for October. Ruiz said she hopes to hold the event again next year.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/09/70/e4/liferun1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:14:54.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
