Kansas City vs. Toronto is a reprised of the 1985 ALCS, which the Royals won. \nThe Toronto-Texas game was proceeding in unremarkable but closely-contested fashion through six innings, when Edwin Encarnarcion's homer for the Blue Jays tied the game 2-2. \nWhat followed will be debated for years to come. \nIn the top of the seventh, Texas' Choo Shin-soo was at the plate when Toronto catcher Russell Martin tried to throw the ball back to the pitcher. The ball hit Choo's bat and dribbled toward third base, allowing runner Rougned Odor to score. \nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister questioned that call, the umpires consulted and overturned that ruling, allowing Odor to trot to home plate for the go-ahead run. \n\"I just caught the ball and threw it back very casually and it hit his bat and then next thing you know run scores. It's never happened in my life before,\" Martin said. \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest and outraged home fans pelted the field with debris during an 18-minute delay. \nThe Rangers then made three consecutive errors to start the bottom of the seventh, with Martin reaching on a fielding error by shortstop Elvis Andrus to start it off. \nKevin Pillar followed with a grounder to first, but Martin was safe at second on an errant throw by Mitch Moreland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:08:43.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
