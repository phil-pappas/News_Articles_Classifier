Saturday's win came in at No. 2 on Lombardi's list, after Utah's victory over Alabama in the 2009 Sugar Bowl.\n\"This sheer margin of this past Saturday's victory earned it consideration for the top spot, but we ultimately couldn't justify ranking a September game over the Sugar Bowl,\" Lombardi wrote.\nGordon Hayward disses Colin Cowherd\nThe Utah Jazz started training camp Tuesday with two practices, but forward Gordon Hayward found time during the evening to publicly criticize media personality Colin Cowherd.\nOn Monday, Cowherd spoke out against the increasing popularity of eSports, which is multiplayer video game competitions. It wasn't the first time Cowherd had done so.\nAn avid gamer, Hayward took issue with Cowherd's criticism with this tweet .\nMark Sandritter of SB Nation picked up on Hayward's tweet and added this commentary :\n\"In League of Legends terms, that was a Faker level burn (don't know who that is? Check out our World Championships beginners guide ),\" Sandritter wrote. \"Did Hayward know that photo existed and just saved it for the perfect moment? Or did he dive deep into a Google search only to come away with that? Either way, that's one heck of a find.\"\nRyan McDonald is a sports reporter at DeseretNews.com .
