All Indians r good. It is politics that we need to improve,\" Kejriwal wrote on Twitter.\nRijiju, Union Minister of State, had yesterday said he agreed with the statement of a former Lt Governor of Delhi who had once remarked that north Indians \"take pride in and enjoy\" breaking rules.\n\"I was witness to a statement made by one of the Lt Governor's of Delhi some years back. He had stated that people of north India enjoy breaking the rules and by evening he was forced to apologise.\n\"But I believe what he said was right,\" he had said on the sidelines of a function for inauguration of a think tank on police-related subjects.\nThough he did not name the Lt Governor, records show the comments were made by the then Delhi LG Tejinder Khanna who had said in February 2008 that \"it is a speciality of north and west India that the people feel a sense of honour and pride in violating law and boasting that no action has been taken against them.\" PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:17:19.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
