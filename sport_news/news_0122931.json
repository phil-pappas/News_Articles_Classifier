Wayne Gallman Wayne Gallman #9 6-1, 210Loganville, GA View Full Profile , who had rushed for at least 100 yards in each of the three previous games, finished with 17 carries for 48 yards. The Tigers finished with 112 yards on 36 rushing attempts. \n“One thing I learned from (former offensive coordinator Chad Morris Chad Morris Offensive Coordinator / QBs View Full Profile ) is you’ve just got to call the game. You can’t focus on that,” Elliott said of the first-half missteps. “Obviously, you’ve got to get a feel for the flow of the game, but we knew that was the plan. We tried to find some opportunities to run it. Again, they were stout against the run, and credit to them. Our guys did a good job of finding some running lanes, but we knew we were going to have to throw the ball. \n“If they were going to continue to play us in bump-and-run coverage and press man, we’ve got to make those plays down the field.” \nSix games into the season – and after six wins – Elliott sees the offense beginning to hit its stride. \nAfter gaining 533 yards against Wofford, the Tigers had 392 against Appalachian State, 401 against Louisville and 296 against Notre Dame. \nThe past two weeks, Clemson has had 537 against Georgia Tech and 532 against Boston College. \n“We feel like we’ve been getting better each week. Obviously, there was a lot of hype going into the season because we returned a lot of the skill guys, but we had some new guys up front that we had to get broken in,” Elliott said. “But if you watch us, week by week, with the exception of some of the turnovers, we feel like we’re getting better. Our guys are on the same page. If you saw Deshaun out there, he was in control of the game. He was sliding protections in the directions that we needed them to slide. \n“And the guys were on the same page and knew what was coming. So we feel like we’re getting better. And again, I told them coming into this game, ‘Let’s make it about us. We’re challenged, we’ve got the No. 1 defense in the country that you’re facing, so let’s go show how good we can be.’ ” \nDaniel Shirley is the sports editor of The Telegraph in Macon, Ga., and co-host of The Morning Show on FoxSports 1670 AM.
