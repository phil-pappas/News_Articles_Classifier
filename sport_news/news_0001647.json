The pressure's on me more than it's on Steve. We've won the last five, so I don't want to be the one who doesn't win it. \n\"But we'll wait and see on the players - only the players can make everyone smile next week. They just have to carry on what they have done five times before. \n\"They have been struggling, but won the last five games against Newcastle. They don't need me to coach them this week! Let's hope for the same again.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:18:34.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
