I know the score was lopsided last year, but I know coach (Jody) Ashby is doing good things here, their record shows it. For us to come out the way we did, I was excited.\" \nChase LeCroy ran 11 times for 185 yards, with a 3-yard touchdown run and a beautiful 17-yard touchdown catch from Adam Bouchard in the first half. \nBouchard hit Jordan Powell with a 64-yard touchdown pass for DC's second score. Powell set up his own score by getting the first interception of the night for DC. \nBouchard also made an 18-yard touchdown throw to John Stratton, and that score was set up by the first of two Chandler Crite interceptions. Bouchard finished 9-of-16 passing for 195 yards. \nBraxton Hurley had a very quick pick six, getting an interception in the end zone after Ohio County had made a goal line stand. \n\"We had four picks, the defense stepped up,\" Brannon said. \"For us to get pressure on the quarterback, we pressued him all night, that was a key for us.\" \nZack McAteer added a 14-yard touchdown run in the third quarter to help the Panthers climb to 6-3, 2-2 in Class 6-A, Region 1, District 2. \nThe Panthers ran for 292 yards as they went for 487 yards in total offense. \n\"We got back to the balance we were looking for,\" Brannon said. \"That's one thing we had struggled with. John, teams have figured him out and are double covering him, that opens up other avenues for us. LeCroy came out and was outstanding, the offensive line, good again, Bouchard is making nice throws, doing what he has to do.\" \nSimmons scored the lone touchdown on a 1-yard sneak for Ohio County (5-4, 1-3). Simmons was 23-for-38 for 280 yards. Noah Miller made eight catches for 137 yards. \nDAVIESS COUNTY 21-14-8-0_43 \nDC-LeCroy 3 run (kick failed). \nDC-Powell 64 pass from Bouchard (Carwile pass from Bouchard). \nDC-Stratton 18 pass from Bouchard (Monanteras kick). \nDC-LeCroy 17 pass from Bouchard (Monanteras kick). \nO-Simmons 1 run (Addington kick). \nDC-Hurley interception in end zone (Monanteras kick). \nDC-McAteer 14 run (Crite pass from McEwen).
