When the Toronto Blue Jays needed to win three elimination games against Texas, their catcher had cheerfully told his teammates they just needed to win 11 in a row again. He was reminded of this. He liked that.\n“I mean, it’s the same situation, backs against the wall, win or go home, and I don’t want to go home yet,” said Martin, after the Jays were crushed 14-2 by the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday, and now trail 3-1 in the American League Championship Series.\n“I love this team. I love our fight. We’ve shown our ability to come back before. Obviously, it’s a different team. I definitely think Kansas City is better than Texas, so it’s going to be a tougher battle. It’s a challenge. I’m up to the challenge.”\nIf you have learned anything about this team, you know that they can do this. These Toronto Blue Jays should be written off when they lose the last game, and not before. They can do this.\nBut after four games the Royals are a better team in every way. Every one. You can say it could have been different, and should have been different, but it’s not. This isn’t the end, but you can see it from here.\n“We’re going to have to play our best game in order to beat these guys,” said third baseman Josh Donaldson.\nThey haven’t done that. The Jays haven’t gotten a signature performance from a starter in this series, though David Price came maddeningly close. In this game, they couldn’t mash the biggest fly ball pitcher in baseball. And they finally had a starter blow up, and had to rummage through the dusty and disused end of their bullpen, until infielder Cliff Pennington became the first position player to pitch in a playoff game in Major League Baseball history. It could have been worse. He didn’t give up a run.\nThe day started with Royals pitcher Johnny Cueto, through his teammate Edinson Volquez, accusing the Jays of stealing signs from centre field in Game 3, the old Man-In-White legend. Even if it wasn’t a ridiculous idea, it was pretty roundly disproved on this day.\n“I mean, honestly, I would tell you,” Martin said. “We did it with the Yankees, we don’t do it here. We just f---ing hit, man. We f---ing crush. Whether it’s here, or on the road or whatever. We don’t do it. Maybe it’s because they do it, and they’re projecting.”\nIf the Kansas City Royals are projecting, then that may be why they are hitting, sort of crushing, merciless. They are hitting .308 in the series, and they are close to taking everything.\nLittle things add up to big things. R.A. Dickey was pulled from Game 4 of the Texas series because manager John Gibbons doesn’t trust the knuckleball. And on this day, it floated like a balloon and the Royals counted off as many of the different kind of at-bats as they could: bunt single, homer, walk, stolen base, regular single, passed ball, 4-3 groundout, sac fly, and finally a strikeout. It was 5-0 when Dickey was removed. It was only 5-2 after Liam Hendricks was dragged out and held the line for as long as he could, going to the seventh. It’s easy to forget that, now. They were one three-run homer away.\nAnd then, the problem. Gibbons is managing his bullpen like it’s full of explosives, and he’s proving himself right. For some reason, he chose 42-year-old LaTroy Hawkins, who had been lit up like a Vegas casino in his two playoff appearances, and who loaded the bases with no outs in the seventh. Gibbons pulled out Ryan Tepera from the spot that could have been Mark Buehrle, because Brett Cecil is hurt and Aaron Loup had to leave for a family matter, and the Jays wanted to save Aaron Sanchez and Roberto Osuna for a Game 5.\nGibbons could have gone with Mark Lowe, but he didn’t, until the eighth. That’s why Pennington got to flash his fastball, and his curve. The Royals have scored 22 runs in two games here, and the Jays are getting beaten. The Game 2 collapse is looming larger all the time.\nI won’t rule out this teamed until the last out, and neither should you. They will rely on Marco Estrada to save their season on Wednesday, with the back of the bullpen a smoking ruin, and will hope to get to David Price in Game 6 and Marcus Stroman in Game 7. It ain’t over ’til it’s over, Yogi Berra was said to say.\nHe’s right. It ain’t over. But it’s close.\nMore on thestar.com\nFive key moments from Blue Jays’ Game 4 ALCS loss to Royals\nALCS Game 4 in pictures", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:42:20.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
