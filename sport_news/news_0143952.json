They raised slogans against the government in support of their demands near Dhindsa’s residence. The farmers have been staging indefinite dharna outside the DC office here since September 28 to press for their demands, including Rs 40,000 per acre compensation for damaged cotton crop and Rs 20,000 for all those labourer families who had got unemployed due to cotton crop damage. State secretary of the Punjab Kisan Union Balbir Singh Jhaloor today said they reached Dhindsa’s house by passing through main bazaars of the city to express their resentment against the state government’s “indifferent” attitude towards their demands. He said they wanted that the state government should pay attention towards their demands at the earliest as farmers were daily committing suicides following heavy losses to their cotton crop recently. All speakers, while flaying the state and Central governments, urged the farmers to come forward to participate in the agitation in large numbers to express their solidarity with the ongoing farmer struggle and force the government to accept their demands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:18:49.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
