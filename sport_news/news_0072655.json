Both seem to think that their ingenuity in one area of life makes them experts on just about everything.\nRenowned brain surgeon Carson is running for the Republican presidential nomination because he thinks he knows enough to be a dandy leader of the free world.\nMedia mega-mogul Murdoch similarly seems to think his business genius makes him an expert on black people.\n\"Ben and Candy Carson terrific,\" Murdoch tweeted after watching Carson — a former contributor to Murdoch's Fox News Channel — and his wife on Fox's \"The Kelly File\" last Wednesday. \"What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide? And much else.\"\nRight. And if anybody should know \"a real\" African-American, it's a white 84-year-old billionaire from Australia.\nThe Twitter universe exploded in speculation as to what Murdoch might have meant. After years of allegations from the political right that President Barack Obama was too black to give whites or, at least conservatives, a fair shake, was Murdoch now saying Obama is not black enough?\nIs Obama in Murdoch's eyes a BINO, Black In Name Only?\nIs Murdoch saying, as conservative provocateur Ann Coulter declared on his network four years ago, \"Our blacks are so much better than their blacks\"?\nRupert Murdoch's 'bro crush' on Ben Carson Dawn M. Turner Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has a \"bro crush\" on Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson that he's been expressing all over Twitter.\nOn Wednesday Murdoch tweeted: \"Ben and Candy Carson terrific. What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide? And much else.\"\n... Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has a \"bro crush\" on Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson that he's been expressing all over Twitter.\nOn Wednesday Murdoch tweeted: \"Ben and Candy Carson terrific. What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide? And much else.\"\n... (Dawn M. Turner) Murdoch sent a second tweet moments after his first, saying, \"Read New York magazine for minority community disappointment with POTUS.\"\nThe mogul apparently was referring to \"The Paradox of the First Black President,\" a thoughtful Oct. 7 article by Jennifer Senior about Obama's racial tightrope: how to address urgent black community concerns without sparking too much backlash from white conservatives.\nBut reading the article makes Murdoch's complaint sound like a humble brag. If he thinks Obama has worsened our racial divide, as many conservatives claim, he had plenty of help from his ideological opponents.\nWhatever Murdoch meant, he apparently realized after hours of backlash on Twitter and other social media that his message needed clarification. \"Apologies!\" his follow-up tweet exclaimed. \"No offense meant. Personally find both men charming.\"\nThat's a relief. But since Obama's racial tightrope apparently comes as news to Murdoch, I, too, have a magazine article to recommend to him: \"The Return of the Middle American Radical,\" a Sept. 8 analysis in the National Journal by John B. Judis. It analyzes the rise of political outsiders like Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Carson — and the challenge their supporters present to today's Republican Party, particularly among white voters.\nThe Middle American Radicals, or MARS, first identified by sociologist Donald Warren in the mid-1970s, Judis reports, are mostly white, lacking college degrees and feeling shafted by political and corporate elites from above and by minorities, liberals and allegedly undeserving poor people from below.\nMARS can be more loyal to personalities than parties when a colorful populist like George Wallace, H. Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan or Trump comes along.\nWhat distinguishes them is their ideology, Judis writes. They don't trust corporate power or either party's political establishment. But they also turn very conservative on poverty and race with \"an intense conviction that the middle class (is) under siege from above and below.\"\nThat's probably what appeals to Murdoch about Carson. Our current black or, at least, biracial Obama apparently is not \"black\" or \"real\" enough for Rupert. A \"real black president\" in Murdoch's mind would share Murdoch's very conservative values — as Carson does.\nTaxes? \"Simply tithe,\" says Carson. Never mind that taxing everybody 10 percent would not only disproportionately burden the poor but also grow the national debt.\nObamacare? \"Worse thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\" says Carson. Never mind the millions of all colors who have health insurance for the first time.\nCarson may be a brilliant brain surgeon, but Republicans could do better at supporting black conservative officeholders. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, for example, the South's first black senator since Reconstruction, won with mostly white votes. Yet he has been a leader on issues like criminal justice reform and police body cameras that his black constituents in particular care about.\nThat's how you practice the politics of addition, not division. I eagerly wait for the party of Abraham Lincoln to practice it again.\nClarence Page, a member of the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at www.chicagotribune.com/pagespage .\ncpage@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ cptime\n Rupert Murdoch Barack Obama White House Clarence Page Ben Carson Pat Buchanan Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/cptime", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/ben-carson/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616addd/turbine/ct-rupert-murdoch-ben-carson-dawn-turner-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56180b3c/turbine/ct-rupert-murdoch-ben-carson-obama-black-president-perspec-1011-jm-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:43:58.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
