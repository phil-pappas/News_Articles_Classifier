Barrett scored three times and No. 1 Ohio State remained unbeaten - and mostly underwhelming - with a 49-28 win over Maryland on Saturday. \nEzekiel Elliott had two touchdowns for the Buckeyes (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten), who were tied 21-21 in the third quarter before shaking free of the Terrapins (2-4, 0-2) and extending the nation's longest winning streak to 19. \nOhio State has won 26 straight regular-season conference games, but again struggled against a huge underdog. \nOhio State coach Urban Meyer juggled his quarterbacks, using Jones to start drives and Barrett to finish them. Jones threw a 19-yard TD pass to Braxton Miller and connected on a 48-yarder to Jalin Marshall. \nOutscored 73-6 the past two weeks, the Terrapins put up a fight amid speculation about coach Randy Edsall's future. \nMaryland quarterback Perry Hills ran for 170 yards and two TDs.
