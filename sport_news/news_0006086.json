He played just three shifts in the preseason before suffering the injury against the New York Rangers on Sept. 24. \nChara has been the mainstay of Boston’s defense the past nine seasons, including a Stanley Cup title in 2011. \nThe Bruins lost their first two games of the season by a combined 10-4 score that featured a number of defensive breakdowns. \nHe received a nice hand when he stepped on the ice for the first time in the opening minute. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:47:24.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
