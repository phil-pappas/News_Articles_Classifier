Smith plays both quarterback and safety for his high school team. In his most recent game, Smith's stat line reads as follows: 9 out of 13 passes completed for 188 yards and four touchdowns, 117 yards rushing and 2 rushing touchdowns. Obviously, Smith is no longer under the radar from a recruiting standpoint. Smith does have plans to head up to Ann Arbor, Michigan, at some point during this season. Smith said, \"I plan on going to one of their games this fall.\"Check out a highlight film from Smith's 2015 season below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:09:36.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
