Even greater accomplishments could be ahead for the in-state schools.\nMore Coverage Predictions: USC reeling, Utes find themselves in position for repeat victory in L.A. October has been about as successful as one could hope for the five Utah Division I college football teams, as they have combined to go 12-1 this month.\nThe lone loss only came when Southern Utah defeated Weber State, although it was a lopsided 44-0 affair.\nStill, each team is well within the realm of finishing with a winning record and perhaps attaining even greater accomplishments. From Utah to Utah State and from Weber State to Southern Utah, these four teams are at or near the top of their respective conference standings. Independent BYU , meanwhile, is 5-2 after playing the toughest part of its schedule.\nWhat has led to the resurgence? Here are several key factors that have fueled the in-state schools’ successful runs through the first half of the season. While each team isn’t following the same mold for success, they each have, to various degrees, been a benefactor from these factors.\nCoaching consistency \nThere has been relatively little head coaching turnover in the state of Utah over the past decade. Utah’s Kyle Whittingham and BYU’s Bronco Mendenhall are the greatest examples of coaching consistency in the state, as they have both been at the helm of their respective programs for 11 straight seasons.\nWhittingham has his program back to a national powerhouse level again, a scene not unfamiliar for the Utes since he took over for Urban Meyer in 2005. Following a 9-4 campaign in 2014 and a current No. 3 national ranking, Whittingham is one of the country’s hottest coaching prospects, even being mentioned for the open coaching position at this week’s opponent, USC .\nMendenhall, meanwhile, has never had a losing season at BYU, and that will continue in 2015. His team this year is trying to surpass an 8-5 benchmark that the Cougars have been stuck at for three seasons. With a BYU squad that has played one of the nation’s toughest schedules to this point in the year, a 5-2 mark — combined with the injuries they have had to overcome — springs optimism for the back half of the season.\nUtah State’s Matt Wells, in his third year, has seamlessly transitioned the Aggies from the Gary Andersen era and continues to have Utah State on the rise. Case in point: their blowout win over Boise State last week, a victory that now has the Aggies as the frontrunner to win the Mountain West crown. Between Wells and Andersen, the USU program has been on solid ground for several years.\n\nEd Lamb is in his eighth season as head coach at Southern Utah and is on pace to lead the Thunderbirds to their fourth winning season under his tutelage. This comes two years after Southern Utah made its first appearance in the FCS playoffs.\nWeber State’s Jay Hill is the only one of the five head coaches who hasn’t had a more extensive track record at his current school, as he is in his second year as head coach of the Wildcats. But Hill, a long-time Utah assistant, has plenty of strong ties to other coaches from the state, including Andersen, now the head coach at Oregon State.\nStrength of the in-state talent \nYoung talent producing \nGritty defenses, turnovers aplenty \n\nUtah State is not far behind, coming in tied for fourth in turnover margin (plus-1.5) while forcing 17 and giving up just eight. Senior linebacker Kyler Fackrell leads the nation in fumble recoveries with four.\nSouthern Utah leads the FCS in turnover margin at plus-1.83. The T'Birds have forced 15 turnovers, including 13 interceptions, while giving up the ball just four times.\nBYU clocks in tied for third nationally in sacks, with 24. The Cougars had eight against Cincinnati in a win last week, the most sacks for BYU in a single game since the 1997 Cotton Bowl.\nSouthern Utah, which has given up just 10 points in its last four games, is also No. 6 in the FCS in red zone defense, allowing opponents to score in the red zone just 56.3 percent of the time.\nWeber State is also strong defensively in the red zone, allowing opponents to score 70 percent of the time, good enough for 24th in the country.\nWhere they stand in conference races", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:33:40.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
