Are they the jocks, cool kids or the do-gooders? \nA University of Maryland student-athlete embodies all of those and has his own non-profit to show for it. \nMael Corboz is a Jersey-boy making big waves in College Park. The Terps' senior soccer captain hopes to lead his team back to a Big Ten title and is using his moves and smarts to help decrease midsections in the Mid-Atlantic. \nThe engineering major hopes to lead children in lower income neighborhoods to the table for better nutrition. Mael and four classmates started a non-profit called \"Healthy HeartBeets\". \n\"We're surrounded by these choices we have to make, a lot of people don't necessarily have the resources some of us do have in terms of education and understanding,\" said Corboz. \nWhen Mael wasn't on the pitch, he was making one. \"Healthy Heartbeets\" started as a class project, but after the class ended, Mael's passion continued. It went from being about providing fast food alternatives to being more about nutrition education. \n\"What you should eat, what you're putting in your body, is just as important as how much you sleep and all the aspects of your life,\" said Corboz. \nHe and the other members of the non-profit spent time in DMV-area middle schools evangelizing about healthy eating, trying to steer kids with fewer resources away from fast food and towards better alternatives. \nMael's path doesn't suprise his coach or teammates. \n\"Mael is a kid who likes to go above and beyond...he's a leader,\" said Aaron Franco, Corboz' teammate. \n\"He started this program on his own. He didn't do it for publicity. He did it because it was the right thing to do and I'm so proud of him,\" said Sasho Cirovski, head coach of Maryland's men's soccer team. \nHis non-profit works with local gardens and gardeners to help spread the message to young people about good eating habits. \nLike this story?
