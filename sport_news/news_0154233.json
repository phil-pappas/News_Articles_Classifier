Veteran right guard Willie Colon was left behind in New Jersey to rehab his sprained knee, which means Winters will start in his place when the Jets face the Dolphins at Wembley Stadium.\nWinters, a third-round draft pick in 2013, started 18 games at left guard for the Jets the past two seasons, but will be making his first start at right guard.\n\"I definitely feel a lot more comfortable there,\" Winters said of the transition. \"I like where I am. … I feel a lot more comfortable at right guard but I’ll play wherever I need to.\"\nWinters indicated he feels more comfortable at right guard because he is right-handed, making it easier for him to push off at the line of scrimmage.\nBut he steadfastly maintained, over and over, that facing the talented Suh and the rest of Miami’s D-Line won’t be anything out of the ordinary.\n\"You come into every game preparing the same way,\" Winters said. \"Obviously they have good players, but you’ve just got to continue to work and study up and take it like any other game.\"\nBut it isn’t any different facing Suh?\n\"He’s a good player but I’m going to take it like any other game,\" Winters said, repeating his mantra. \"I face good players every week.\"\nOK, so those answers were boring. The Jets won’t mind if Winters’ play blends into the scenery just as much Sunday, because when offensive linemen aren’t noticeable to the average person, that usually means they aren’t making many big mistakes.\nWinters replaced the injured Colon in the second half of the Jets’ loss to Philadelphia five days ago and allowed some penetration by defensive end Brandon Bair that allowed him to tip a Ryan Fitzpatrick pass that subsequently was intercepted. Other than that, Winters felt he played well in the game.\nCertainly the Jets have confidence in him.\n\"Brian’s a tough guy. He’ll fight,\" coach Todd Bowles said when asked about the potential matchup.\nBowles joked that his advice to Winters would be, \"Just eat your Wheaties.\"\nThe Jets are wary of Suh even though his play has been underwhelming so far after signing a six-year, $114 million free-agent deal with the Dolphins in March. Through three games, the 6-foot-4, 320-pounder has only seven tackles and no sacks.\n\"He’s a great player, obviously,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"He signed for all that money for a reason.\"\n\"It doesn’t matter who you play. It’s about us,\" right tackle Breno Giacomini said. \"But it is noted that [defensive end Cameron] Wake and Suh are on the same side [of Miami’s defensive front]. … I think [Suh] is a great player. He plays tough. He plays strong. He plays through the whistle. I’ve been known to do that, too, so I appreciate that.\"\n\"He looks so big and powerful, but he’s got some speed,\" Giacomini said of Suh. \"He knows how to use his technique. … His toolbox of defensive moves or techniques that he uses is pretty full. He can change it up at any time.\"\nEmail: pelzman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:32:56.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
