Do you know what the crime rate of Gujarat was when Narendra Modi was the chief minister? He is abusing the people of Bihar and me. I am addressing him as a 'bramhapishaach'...a dangerous ghost and we have ways to ward him off,\" Lalu told the media.\nLalu's statement comes in the wake of an FIR filed against him after he had said how a 'narbhakshi' of Gujarat riots was now roaming around in Bihar, while addressing a rally earlier.\nShah, while addressing a rally in Begusarai, referred to Lalu's conviction in a fodder scam case, alleging that Bihar, which had a glorious past, had attained a bad name due to 'chara-chor' Lalu, after which an FIR was filed against him too.\nMeanwhile, Condemning the remarks on beef made by RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Union Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and senior BJP leader Giriraj Singh on Saturday said that the 'whole clan of RJD has gone mad.'\n\"I am very much hurt by hearing this statement of Raghuvansh Prasad. I think all this spoken as a well thought strategy made by Lalau Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar. Whatever he is speaking is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated,\" Singh said.\n\"I think Lalu and his party leaders are making these kinds of statements just for the sake of votes. I think the whole clan of RJD has gone mad,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:15:03.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
