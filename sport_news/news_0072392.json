However, Udrih is expected to play Wednesday night when the Griz face the Atlanta Hawks after sitting out the last two preseason games with a right ankle sprain.\nUdrih, who underwent off-season surgery to remove bone spurs in the same ankle, called his absence precautionary. He declared that Memphis' final two exhibition contests – the last being Friday at Orlando – will get him ready for the regular-season opener Oct. 28 against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\"The fact that I was able to stay off of it and do conditioning without pressure on the ankle was good,\" Udrih said. \"It's always good when you don't have to rush back. But we're a week away (from the regular-season opener) so there's plenty of time to get some extra conditioning. I'll be ready to go.\"\nUdrih suffered the injury Oct. 12 when the Griz played the Cavs on the Ohio State campus. He landed awkwardly after being fouled on a jump shot. Udrih then writhed in pain for several minutes before hobbling to the bench.\nThe 33-year-old returned to shoot free throws after a timeout but immediately committed a foul to leave the game. He hadn't played or practiced before Tuesday, when Udrih participated in a full-contact workout.\n\"Now, it's time to get in playing shape. I'm feeling good so far,\" Udrih said. \"I'll play (against Atlanta) and see how it feels. We'll go from there.\"\nGriz coach Dave Joerger initially sounded a bit concerned about Udrih's readiness, citing his veteran point guard's inability to maintain conditioning due to off-season surgery and the training camp injury.\n\"He needs the minutes,\" Joerger said. \"But he'll get there.\"\nStill, Udrih remains the Grizzlies' best option behind starter Mike Conley because of his experience and proficient mid-range game. Although third-string guard Russ Smith's speed and quickness has made him a fan favorite, Udrih offers a less mistake-prone option for Joerger.\n\"The pace he plays at is wonderful. He plays at a great pace. He's one of the best mid-range players in this game,\" Conley said of Udrih. \"The way he can pull up and knock down shots, and create his own offense is unbelievable. It's been good for me to learn from him. He's made me better, and I've made him better. People forget that he was hurt, too, in the playoffs last year and we're better when he's healthy.\"\nThe Griz guaranteed Udrih's contract for this season in July. It was an expected move, and Udrih is now set to earn $2.2 million for the 2015-16 season.\nUdrih, though, was hobbled throughout the Grizzlies' Western Conference semifinals loss to the eventual NBA champion Golden State Warriors. Udrih suffered a right ankle injury in Game 2 of a first-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers. He missed Game 3 and returned to play in Game 4.\nBut Udrih's ankle still was noticeably swollen and bruised at the start of the Grizzlies' series with the Warriors. He averaged just 4.4 points on 35 percent shooting overall (22 percent from 3-point range) against Golden State.\nBut Udrih has been a steady contributor off the bench since the Griz acquired him in 2014. In 79 regular-season appearances last season, Udrih averaged 7.7 points on 48.7 percent shooting in 18.9 minutes per game.\nUdrih's game doesn't figure to change even with the Griz adding more athleticism to the second unit with Matt Barnes and Brandan Wright.\n\"I just want to run the team and keep the turnovers down. The second unit has to be aggressive and make plays,\" Udrih said. \"We might be a little quicker and longer, but Kosta (Koufos) really ran the court, so it's pretty much the same thing. We know our system works. We proved that last year and the year before. And then, whenever in doubt, just throw it up there to Brandan.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:30:23.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
