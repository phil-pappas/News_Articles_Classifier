The playmaker was involved in the visitors' best chance, slipping the ball to Karlen Mkrtchyan, whose low cross was nearly turned in by Artem Simonyan.\nNice-born French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was cheered every time he intervened, frequently called into action as a sweeper-keeper as Armenia looked for space in behind the centre-halves.\nRaising their game, France took the lead ten minutes before the break, striker Antoine Griezmann exchanging passes with Benzema before firing a right-footed shot through Kasparov's legs for his first international goal in 11 months.\nTen minutes into the second half Yohan Cabaye's terrific goal extended France's advantage. After playing a glorious crossfield ball to Mathieu Valbuena, the midfielder continued his run.\nPicked out at the edge of the box, he took one touch to control and with his second dispatched the ball into the bottom corner.\nBenzema soared high to head in a Griezmann corner in the 78th minute and soon helped himself to a second, profiting from an astute deflection by substitute Anthony Martial to apply a confident finish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:24:46.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
