Miami Dolphins at Tennessee Titans Caption When the Dolphins run Evan Vucci / AP \nSo far the biggest key to the running game has been either getting a lead, or staying close. Otherwise, they tend to abandon the run. That’s why RB Lamar Miller (37 carries, 131 yards, 3.5 yards per carry) is down about 4.25 carries per game from last season. Perhaps RB Jonas Gray (10 carries, 49 yards) gets more of a shot this week. Tennessee, led by DT Jurrell Casey, an All Pro in 2013, is 23rd in run defense at 117 yards per game, so there’s hope of the Dolphins putting together a ground game. But they need to get an early lead or stay close. EDGE: DOLPHINS \nSo far the biggest key to the running game has been either getting a lead, or staying close.

But the Dolphins’ run defense is the worst in the NFL at 160.5 yards per game. The front seven haven’t been able to tackle anyone at, or near, the line of scrimmage. DT Ndamukong Suh (10 tackles, 3 for loss) had his best game against the New York Jets, but it still was a disappointment. Run defense improvement must start with the DL and there’s no strong indication that will happen. If this area doesn’t improve, the Dolphins are likely doomed because the Titans are second in the NFL in time of possession (34:18).
