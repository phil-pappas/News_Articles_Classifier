The game was once a regular Thanksgiving Cay affair. \nTHIS DATE IN BEARCAT HISTORY: The Bearcats are 9-3-1 all time in games documented to have been played on Oct. 16. Ten different schools have been an Oct. 16 opponent, none of which has been Paris. \nOn Oct. 16, 1998 at Lamar then-sophomore Trey Holloway drew the start at quarterback and he and Brandon Rowland threw for a combined 120 yards in a 35-0 win. Rowland also ran 90 yards for a touchdown in the game. \nThe Oct. 16, 1981 game was a nail-biter with the Bearcats beating Greenwood 8-7. Benny Sanderson hit Mark Merrill for 66 yards and the touchdown and the Bearcats won it with a two point conversion. Okay it that’s not ironic enough to have Booneville beat Greenwood via the pass, there were also four Bearcat interceptions that night, by John Massey, Merrill, Doug Shott and Alan King. \nRandy May also had a four touchdown night against Waldron on Oct. 16, 1992 in a game the Bearcats won 35-12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:12:43.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
