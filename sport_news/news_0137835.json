His entire 6-foot-4 frame is soaked in some pungent combination of champagne and beer, a condition that leaves him describing how it all feels in one simple word: “cold.”\nHe is cold, but his baseball heart has never been so warm.\nHe and his Mets are moving on in the baseball postseason, set to host Game 1 of the National League Championship Series tonight at Citi Field, a thrilling 3-2 win over the Dodgers on Thursday night in Los Angeles closing the chapter on one story and handing Harvey the chance to write the next. With the ball in his hand, Harvey takes the mound tonight as free and clear as he’s ever been as a Met, no more innings limits to consider, no more mandatory workouts to miss, a Game 1 playoff start his to make.\nIs he ready to go?\n“Absolutely,” he hollered into the postgame din. “And I hope you never ask me that question again.”\nThere is no anger in him now, no exasperation at the seemingly unending and unanswerable question that has framed his season, no more need to balance his personal protection against the team’s need. He’s all-in now, willing to pitch out of the bullpen Thursday night, mollified only in that desire by his manager’s assurance that the next Game 1 start would be his.\n“He came to the front of the plane [on Wednesday],” manager Terry Collins recalled, doing his own best to be heard above the din of the winning clubhouse. “I’m sound asleep. He had to wake me up and he’s asking – ‘What about tomorrow?’\n“I said, ‘You’ll pitch if it goes extra innings, but you’re going to start Game 1.’ And he had a big smile on his face.”\nThat smile was still there Thursday night, when this most complicated Met, the man of the missed workout and maxed pitch counts, said of the noise around him: “This sounds wonderful.” He looked as happy as he ever has since becoming a major league Met, smiling and laughing as he bobbed and weaved his way around the splashes of liquid headed in his direction, narrowly avoiding the streams of wetness aimed straight over his head.\n“This is amazing,” he said. “This is what baseball’s about. You kind of dream of this moment and still it doesn’t compare to anything that happens.”\nThe poise he shows on the pitcher’s mound, the cool, hip bravado he puts on for the public, all of that was gone in an L.A. instant, evaporated in the blazing Jeurys Familia fastball that recorded the final strikeout of Thursday’s game.\n“I was standing next to Kelly Johnson — him and I have a really good relationship and have become close friends — and when Familia got two out, two strikes, we kind of just smirked at each other. We knew what was going to happen,” Harvey said. “Once he got the final out I kind of panicked. I started searching around and everyone jumped over the railing. I was the last one out, but I tried to sneak around the coaches. They were going crazy.”\nWho wasn’t? But now, with the champagne dried and the team back in New York, it falls to Harvey to keep the train rolling. His gritty five-inning start earned him the victory in Game 3 of the NL Division Series, but that was won more by the explosive Mets’ lineup than by Harvey. Most notable from the outing was the fact that it put him at 194¤ innings on the year, pushing him a little further away from the 180-inning limit that Harvey said his agent, Scott Boras, had set in consultation with the surgeon who performed Harvey’s Tommy John elbow surgery.\nFor Collins, Harvey’s early-September reticence about pushing past that 180-inning threshold, his admission in Miami that the limit could possibly put him out of postseason consideration, was nothing more than a verbal mistake. For the manager, Harvey has always wanted to pitch.\n“I will tell you what. You’re not going to find anyone who’s going to defend him more than me,” Collins said. “I know this guy. What he said was not the proper thing, cause this kid is a competitor. He wants to be on the mound in the big game, the big stage, on the biggest of the nights. And he’s going to be Saturday.\n“I think this is why Matt Harvey is a pitcher. This is what he’s wanted to do.”\nHe’s living the dream, in a dream series between the Mets and the Cubs, two rosters shaped around young talent, sluggers in Chicago uniforms and pitchers in Mets ones, two teams far different now from when they met seven times in the regular season. The Cubs won all seven of those games, but the last one was played July 2. The Mets have since added Yoenis Cespedes, called up Michael Conforto and welcomed back David Wright.\nIt all starts with Harvey.\n“It’s a huge honor,” he said. “I am very excited about it. I was a little disappointed in my last start, so getting another chance to go back out there and start us off right is everything I want.”\nEmail: sullivan@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:54:41.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
