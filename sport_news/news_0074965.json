Now tactical silence is his new weapon of choice,\" Kumar said in a series of tweets ahead of Modi's rallies in Bihar on Sunday.\n\"The saga continues, so let us brace ourselves for a repeat performance in Bihar,\" he said, alluding to Modi's rhetorical skills.\nKumar questioned Modi for his silence on promises like bringing back black money from abroad, hike in MSP for farmers, employment for youths, special status for Bihar among others and charged the Prime Minister with conveniently forgetting all those pomises made during the general elections last year.\n\"No words on promises he made and then conveniently forgot - black money, farmer MSP, youth employment, special status for Bihar - lists goes on,\" the chief minister said.\nThe senior JD(U) leader also hauled up the PM for his continued silence on the killing of two Dalit siblings in Haryana and the Dadri lynching incident in Uttar Pradesh, besides ever increasing prices of dal and said that it was baffling to note that someone (Modi) who did not miss an opportunity to 'talk or tweet' on anything has not spoken on these raging issues so far.\n\"For someone who doesn't miss an opportunity to talk or tweet by the minute on literally anything, it is baffling that Modiji doesn't speak a word on issues that exhort the collective conscience of the country or bother the common masses... No words on gruesome killing of Dalit children in Haryana, mob lynching in Dadri or skyrocketing prices of dal,\" Kumar said.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-25T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:15:10.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
