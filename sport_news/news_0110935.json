Kickoff will be approximately 10:15 p.m. Eastern Time.\nHow will the Huskies adjust?\n\"You go out there, eat dinner the day before a little bit later and you just deal with it,\" Diaco said. \"You get to bed on what the clock says out there, even though maybe it's a little bit later, try to wake up based on what the clock says ... just try to assimilate right away, not overthink it.\"\nUConn’s longest trip ever was to the Phoenix area for the Fiesta Bowl in 2011.\nThe Cougars know something about traveling.\nLast year, BYU visited Connecticut for the season opener last season, then went to Texas the following week. Later, the Cougars played at Central Florida, at Boise State, at Middle Tennessee and at California before ending the season against Memphis in the Miami Beach Bowl.\nThis season, BYU has already played at Nebraska, UCLA and Michigan.\nMAN-PRESS COVERAGE: Michigan held the Cougars to just 55 passing yards last week in a 31-0 victory. BYU struggled handling the Wolverines’ man-press coverage.\n“I think we just got out-physicaled. They were good,” said Cougar wide receiver Colby Pearson. “I think they were professional holders. They got their hands good on us and held on to us. It was hard for us. We hadn’t seen that kind of physicality yet. We’ve come up with some things to beat that man-press stuff.”\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if now after seeing UCLA and Michigan, there’s going to be a lot of man (coverage),” said BYU wide receiver Terenn Houk.\nHow can BYU receivers overcome man-press coverage?\n“Same way we try to beat any team on man, we have to be very physical off the ball. Coach (Robert) Anae stressed that all week against Michigan,” Houk said. “As players, that’s our job to step up and be as physical as we can and we just didn’t get that job done. We need to do a better job against UConn. I feel like teams are going to come at us with man pressure. We have to be ready to get used to that and beat it because that’s the only way we’re going to get over it.”\nEXTRA POINTS: BYU and UConn are meeting for only the second time  Last year, the Cougars beat the Huskies, 35-10, at UConn in what was the debut of coach Bob Diaco  BYU is 8-2 under coach Bronco Mendenhall in the fifth game of the season  UConn assistant coaches Don Patterson and Frank Verducci were on the Iowa staff when BYU and Iowa played to a 13-13 tie in the 1991 Holiday Bowl  UConn assistant Kevin Wolthausen was on the Oklahoma staff in 1994 when the Cougars blasted the Sooners, 31-6, in the Copper Bowl.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:23:49.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
