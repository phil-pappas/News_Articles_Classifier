The Nigerian youth international replaced Sterling with 12 minutes left to play for what was his third senior appearance for the Citizens who top the Premier League log after nine games. \nAlso in England, Victor Anichebe was benched for the third consecutive West Brom league game in Saturday’s 1-0 home win against Sunderland. He has played only one league game so far this term. \nAt the Selhurst Park, Victor Moses played for 74 minutes in West Ham’s 3-2 win over Crystal Palace. It was his third start this season since joining on a season loan deal from Chelsea. \nIn the English Championship, Chuba Akpom and Sone Aluko were both second-half substitutes in Hull City’s 1-1 draw away at Sheffield Wednesday. \nAluko was a 90th minute substitute for Declan John in Cardiff City’s goalless draw away at Preston North End. \nIn Germany, Anthony Ujah fired blanks for Werder Bremen who lost by a lone goal at home to Bayern Munich. \nIn Celtic, Efe Ambrose made his fourth SPL start for Celtic who defeated Motherwell by a lone goal. It was his fifth start of the season. Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:38:21.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
