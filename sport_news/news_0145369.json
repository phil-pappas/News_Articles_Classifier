Stanley Absanon was chosen as the OVC Specialist of the Week and Chris Kelly earned OVC Co-Defensive Player of the Week honors. \nAbsanon, a 5-foot-11 senior cornerback from Auburndale, Florida, was a game-changer on special teams. He totaled 141 yards in the return game, averaging 25.4 yards on five kickoff returns. His 42-yard return to open the third quarter fueled Eastern’s go-ahead touchdown. The offense only had to cover 54 yards to take a 13-7 lead. His 19-yard punt return early in the fourth quarter gave the Colonels the ball at the UK 26 yard line, which they soon converted into another touchdown and a 20-13 lead against the SEC team. \nIn addition to his work on special teams, Absanon has a 22-yard interception return, a pass break-up and four tackles on defense. \nKelly, a 5-foot-11 senior linebacker from Cold Spring, Kentucky, finished with 11 tackles, a sack and a quarterback hurry against the Wildcats. \nThe Colonels have a short week to prepare for a visit from Tennessee Tech on Thursday at Roy Kidd Stadium. Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:43:39.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
