The IRS does not make such calls, and it does not contact residents over the phone with threats of arrest. \nOfficials are also warning of a phone scheme targeting wireless phone users. These calls often disconnect after one ring, not giving the consumer time to answer the call and tempting them to call back. If a call like this is received, residents are encouraged not to call back. \nComplaints can be filed through the Federal Communications Commission at www.fcc.gov/complaints or by calling 888-225-5322.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:08:52.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
