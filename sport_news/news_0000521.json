My next tournament will now be Q-School.\" \nMolinari, who made three visits to the qualifying school before winning three tournaments to top the Challenge Tour rankings in 2009, is 154th on the Race to Dubai with only the top 110 retaining their cards at the end of the season. \nThe two-time European Tour winner, who came back from a serious wrist injury to finish 40th on the money list last season, has failed to record a top-10 finish in 2015 and is currently ranked 279th in the world. He was ranked a career-high 14th in October 2010. \nOn the course, Denmark's Soren Kjeldsen was setting the early pace in the pro-am event played on the Old Course at St Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns. \nStarting on the back nine at Kingsbarns, which has produced two scores of 60 in the previous three years, Kjeldsen followed two pars with five birdies in the next seven holes to enjoy a one-shot lead over a six-strong group which included England's James Morrison and Scotland's Scott Jamieson.
