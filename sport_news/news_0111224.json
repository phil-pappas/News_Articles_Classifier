Zak Keefer , zak.keefer@indystar.com 8:18 p.m. EDT October 19, 2015 \"We all buy into the plan; that's the way it is,\" Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck says a day after the ill-fated, fake punt play against the New England Patriots on Oct. 18, 2015. Clark Wade/IndyStar Buy Photo Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck on Oct. 18, 2015, talks with his teammates on the bench during second half action of an NFL football game at Lucas Oil Stadium. (Photo: Matt Kryger/Indy Star) Buy Photo \nA day after he made his first start in three weeks, threw the football 50 times for just the seventh time in his career and put together his finest outing as a pro against his greatest NFL adversary, Andrew Luck was asked about the one thing he didn’t want to talk about. \nYou know, that sore right shoulder of his. How’s it feeling? \n“Good,” he said succinctly. \nNext question. \nThat’s Andrew Luck, averse to talking about all things Andrew Luck. He has loathed the watchful gaze heaped on him in recent weeks while he battled back from the first significant injury of his professional football career, most of all the scrutiny and the questions and the uncertainty that have come with it. In his perfect world, it’s all about football, about the Indianapolis Colts, about the defense he’ll see the coming Sunday. The spotlight has never been his forte. \nAnd so Monday it was a return to normal for the Colts' Pro Bowl quarterback, a day after he laid to rest any notions that his banged up shoulder couldn’t carry as heavy a workload as required to compete with the Super Bowl champs. Luck wasn’t sterling in Sunday night’s 34-27 loss to the Patriots, to be sure, but 30 completions for 312 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions against a Bill Belichick-coached defense is nothing to be ashamed of. \nHe was good enough for them to win. That’s growth, especially against this opponent. \n“He played well,” coach Chuck Pagano said. “Obviously, we expect him to play even better this Sunday.” Ummm ... Indianapolis Colts coach Chuck Pagano answers some of your questions \nThat’d be Luck’s second game back from injury, Sunday’s date at home against the New Orleans Saints. Though Luck was erratic at times against the Patriots — a handful of second-half throws sailed high of their intended targets — he resisted the downfield temptations that have buried so many quarterbacks against New England, himself included. Luck didn’t throw a single interception, the first time in five career meetings with the Patriots he’s managed to finish the game unscathed. \nHis game was sensible, more than anything else, steeled in the hard lessons New England has doled out to him in years past. Before Sunday Luck watched two straight games from the sideline, heeding the lessons employed by his 40-year-old backup, Matt Hasselbeck. That is: Mistake-free football is winning football. \nOn Sunday night, Luck looked like a quarterback who’d been taking notes the past few weeks. \nThis felt like progress. This looked like progress. \n“(He) made great decisions,” Pagano said. “Took what the defense was giving him. (If) it wasn’t there down the field, throw it away, hit a check down, play really good football.” \n“He looked fine. He looked back,” added tight end Coby Fleener.

The Patriots won 34-27. (Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) \nHas Luck turned the page against New England? Has he finally proven ready to topple his version of NFL kryptonite? \nHe wouldn’t go there Monday. But the numbers bear it out: Luck set career bests against the Patriots in completion percentage (60 percent), touchdowns (three) and passer rating (98.1). He entered the game having thrown 10 interceptions in four games with New England. He didn't throw a single pick Sunday night. \n“(I) missed opportunities, missed some spots, missed some throws,” Luck said. “Love to have them back, but the beauty of sports is you can’t. Hindsight’s 20-20.” \nLuck connected with 10 different receivers as the Colts piled up more points (27) than they have against New England in five years. Indy’s offense topped 400 yards for the first time all season and netted 24 first downs, a season-high. Remove one ill-conceived fake punt, and the Colts have a realistic shot in the fourth quarter. \nBut, trailing by double digits in the second half, the Colts veered away from the steady diet of runs that had carried them early. Starter Frank Gore was going to work on the Patriots' defensive line in the first half, churning out 53 yards on eight carries. He saw just five carries in the second half. No surprise, then, that the Colts’ consistency in the run game evaporated. They became one-dimensional.

(Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) \nThus, it all fell on Luck. The Colts called 26 consecutive pass plays to close the game. They lost by seven. \n“Did we get away from it a little bit too soon? Yeah,” Pagano said of the run game. “But you’re going to do what you think is best to win the game and get the ball down the field. We could’ve stayed maybe with the run a little bit longer … Frank could’ve run it a few times there. That’s on me.” Gore finished with 78 yards and a six-yards-per-carry average. The balance the Colts perpetually seek on offense? It was there for the taking. And yet they fell back on an old vice. Gore never touched the ball in the fourth quarter. \nThus the Colts fell to 3-4 in games Luck attempts 50 or more passes. \nMost significant: Luck falls to 0-5 all-time against his greatest nemesis. This was closer. This was progress. \nBut don’t try telling Andrew Luck that. \n“It was a one-score game at the end, but it’s a loss,” he said. “At the end of the day it’s a loss. Did some things well. Didn’t do that enough. Missed some throws missed some opportunities. How you lose doesn’t really matter.” \nCall Star reporter Zak Keefer at (317) 444-6134.
