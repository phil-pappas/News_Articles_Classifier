Before O’Keeffe and Luhan.\nThe four – Natalie Curtis, Carol Stanley, Alice Klauber and Mary Cabot Wheelwright – are the main subjects of Lesley Poling-Kempes’ new book “Ladies of the Canyons.”\nReading the book is a rewarding experience. It illuminates the previously neglected contributions of these women within multiple historical contexts.\nIt sheds light on their connections to regional, nationally and internationally known figures in the arts, in anthropology and in politics of that period. It shows each of them as “The New Woman” who was breaking free of Victorian America’s tethers on single women.\nCurtis, a concert pianist and composer, left the comfort of her family’s New York City home to head to West in search of a healthier climate. She ended up recording the songs of the Hopi and other tribes.\nBy experience, Curtis was an ethnologist and ethnomusicologist who quietly championed the preservation of their culture.\nBy interest, she fought federal policies on boarding Indian children; she told Teddy Roosevelt, a family friend, about injustices against Indians.\n“Ladies of the Canyons – A League of Extraordinary Women and Their Adventures in the American Southwest” by Lesley Poling-Kempes\nUniversity of Arizona Press, 24.95, 373 pp. Stanley left her home near Boston to eventually run dude ranches in northern New Mexico. She founded Ghost Ranch.\nKlauber, from California, was an unassuming artist who often painted in Santa Fe. She became a patron of the arts in San Diego, Calif.\nWheelwright left her Boston Brahmin life, to come to the Southwest. She recorded Navajo chants, myths and ceremonies that led to her founding the Museum of Navajo Ceremonial Art (renamed the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian) in Santa Fe.\nPoling-Kempes’ book came out of her research on a book about Ghost Ranch.\n“There was Carol Stanley, who built the first cottages, the headquarters at Ghost Ranch and lived alone there in 1931,” she said. “I thought, ‘Why didn’t we talk about her? Why didn’t we know about her?'”\nThe author began digging into diaries and journals and later other archival material.\n“So I knew Wheelwright was somehow involved with Carol but I didn’t know how. The same with Alice Klauber. I had never heard of her. She was also connected with Natalie Curtis,” Poling-Kempes said.\n“I knew there was a great story about these women. I was never certain how interesting their stories would be. There was more to their stories than I thought. It was wonderful. Their lives reached out to other people’s lives.”\nThe more she pursued, the more substance she found in the stories of these women’s intertwined lives rooted in northern New Mexico.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bks_j11Oct_Kempes_CMYK-450x600.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bks_j11Oct_Kempes2_CMYK-270x400.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:30:48.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
