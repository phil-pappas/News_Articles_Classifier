It had to be the worst officiated game ever,\" Jones said. \"These phantom holding calls. They got a guy two guys double teaming Poona Ford, defensive tackle for the 'Horns. He's pushed back about 10 yards and you call holding, on a running play? On the defensive tackle? I wish I could utilize some words that I want to utilize on your family oriented radio show.\"\nHe challenged the Big 12 Coordinator of Officials Walt Anderson. Jones disagreed with Anderson's opinion that the majority of the call Saturday were spot on.\n\"What about the one's that weren't [Spot on]?\" Jones said. \"What about the ones that nullified a touchdown? And they called holding on big No. 77, Vahe. It wasn't even close to a holding penalty. That was atrocious. That was some horrible officiating.\"\nJones said the unsportsmanlike penalty called on Charlie Strong was ridiculous. He also couldn't believe Oklahoma State quarterback J.W. Walsh recovered a fumble in a pile of three Longhorns.\nJones also said he couldn't believe the way special teams has cost Texas during the past two games. Especially the mishandled snap by freshman punter Michael Dickson that set up the Cowboys' game winning field goal.\n\"We're in kicker purgatory right now,\" Jones said. \"Unreal. I need a therapist after watching that. I couldn't believe that. Are you kidding me? A simple snap and the ball beat [Dickson] up. I feel horrible for the young man. Hell, I feel horrible for me and all the Longhorn fans because they had a chance to win that game.\"\nJones also said he believes Texas is going in the right direction and Strong is the right guy for the position.\n\"I think we're going to be fine as long as we're not getting annihilated on the field,\" Jones said.\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-10-01T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:33:28.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
