L. Max Nikias demonstrated his support for Athletic Director Pat Haden in a statement issued early Monday morning. \n“As president of USC I am very, very fortunate to have Pat Haden as our Athletic Director — as is the entire Trojan Family,” Nikias said. “He is a man of true character and integrity, he cares deeply for our student athletes, and he always makes their well-being his highest priority.” \nHaden had received criticism for the way he handled the Sarkisian situation, dating back to when he didn’t discipline the coach for his inappropriate behavior at the annual Salute to Troy event. \nThe 62-year-old Haden, who took over as athletic director in 2010, named offensive coordinator Clay Helton interim head coach after asking Sarkisian to take a leave of absence on Sunday. \n“Pat Haden has been doing an outstanding job in leading Trojan Athletics in the past five years and I want to take this opportunity to reiterate my unwavering support for him,” Nikias said. “I look forward to working with Pat Haden as our USC AD for many years to come.” \nBased on Nikias’s sentiments, it seems Haden’s job is secure for the time being. \nOn Tuesday, the Trojans got back on the practice field for the first time since Sarkisian was fired.
