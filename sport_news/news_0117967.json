It doesn't matter who I play with or how big you are. I play the same way.\"\nPerhaps most impressive was that Saydee's kick return came seconds after Del-Val Charter initiated some pregame woofing at midfield. \nThe Warriors entrance included bounding out of a makeshift balloon archway, then running near midfield, stopping about 25 yards away from the Prep Charter sideline. \nReferees and coaches quickly intercepted the jawing, and the teams returned to their sideline without incident. \n\"That's how it is, that's how it's got to be,\" Saydee said. \"It's a rivalry game, so that's what you expect to happen. Everybody was hyped up.\" \nThe Huskies (4-2, 3-0) used the momentum to nab a 14-0 advantage in the first quarter. \nAnthony Thomas' 33-yard score came off a fake punt on 4th and 12. \nA safety and a 14-yard touchdown pass from Shayne Smith to Kyeef Williams got the Warriors (3-4, 2-1) within 14-8 at the half. \nWilliams then took the opening kick of the second half 65 yards for a score. The score remained tied at 14 after Del-Val failed on the conversion attempt. \nQuadir Strothers (146 yards on 25 carries) broke the tie with a 32-yard touchdown run, and Saydee added insurance with a 46-yard run in the fourth. \nThe Huskies' defense was also important. \nStrothers, Marque McDuffy, and Kareem Dennis each had an interception. Dennis also forced and recovered a fumble. \nMcDuffy forced a fumble on Del-Val's final drive with less than a minute to play and the Warriors at the Huskies' 34-yard line. \nPrep Charter 14 0 7 7 - 28 \nDel-Val Charter 0 8 6 6 - 20 \nP: Edward Saydee 99 kick return (Andres Ospina kick) \nP: Anthony Thomas 33 run (Ospina kick) \nD: Kyeef Williams 14 pass from Shayne Smith (run failed) \nD: Williams 65 kick return (run failed) \nP: Quadir Strothers 32 run (Ospina kick) \nP: Saydee 46 run (Ospina kick) \nD: Shaheed Brown 3 run (Brown run)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:13:19.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
