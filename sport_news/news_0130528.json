Rangers miss shot to lock up AL West 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Arlington, Texas\nMike Trout hit a leadoff triple in the ninth inning and scored on Albert Pujols ' tiebreaking single, sending the wild card-contending Los Angeles Angels to a 2-1 win over Texas that kept the Rangers from clinching the AL West title Friday night.\nRangers closer Shawn Tolleson (6-4) appeared in his fourth consecutive game. Trout hit the second pitch deep into the right-center gap, then slid headfirst into third base before emphatically pumping his right arm toward his teammates in the dugout.\nPujols followed with a soft single to left field on the next pitch.\nTexas went into Friday already assured a playoff spot, but able to secure the division title with a win over the Angels or a loss by second-place Houston.\nThe Astros were playing in Arizona later Friday night.\nLos Angeles began the day tied with Minnesota and a game behind Houston in the race for the second AL wild card.\nTwins: Ben Zobrist put a major dent in Minnesota's postseason bid with an RBI double in the eighth inning against struggling All-Star Glen Perkins, and Kansas City topped the Twins. Perkins, hampered by neck and back trouble that led to him losing the closer role, spoiled a stellar start by Ervin Santana (7-5) with a first-pitch fastball that Zobrist drove off the wall in right-center field. Zobrist then scored when right fielder Torii Hunter fumbled a single by Mike Moustakas . The Twins entered the night trailing Houston by one game and tied with Los Angeles in the AL wild-card race. Chris Young gave the defending AL champion Royals another reason to consider him for the postseason rotation, giving up four hits in 61/3 innings. Louis Coleman (1-0), Ryan Madson and Wade Davis wrapped up the win, with Davis notching his 16th save in 17 attempts.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/63/8731902/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/63/8731902/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:22:11.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
