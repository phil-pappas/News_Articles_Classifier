It was a Belgian player, Jean-Marc Bosman, who 20 years ago convinced a European court that players should have the right to be free agents at the end of their contracts. It swung the balance of power from the clubs to the players. The current group of Belgian players are very good indeed, and the country is among the favorites to win the European Championship next year. Among the stars are: •Eden Hazard, the Chelsea winger who was voted the outstanding player in England’s Premier League last season. •Kevin De Bruyne, who was judged to be the best player in Germany’s Bundesliga last year before he moved from Wolfsburg to Manchester City over the summer in an $85 million deal. •Thibaut Courtois, also of Chelsea, who is one of the finest young goalkeepers in the world. •Vincent Kompany, the captain of Manchester City and of the Belgian national team, who, when healthy, is among the most imposing defenders of this era. Hazard and Kompany are at the center of an issue that should concern every professional player and official in the game today. Both represented Belgium last week as it qualified for the Euro 2016 finals, and both were benched by their club’s coaches when they returned to the Premier League over the weekend. Hazard was unwittingly the player at the center of the Chelsea storm in August after he seemingly was injured during a game against Swansea City. As he lay on the ground, the team’s doctor and physiotherapist ran to treat him on the field near the end of a 2-2 draw. José Mourinho, the Chelsea manager, was livid. He called his medical staff naïve and impulsive, and he asserted his right to keep them off his bench. The doctor, Eva Carneiro, has not worked at Chelsea since then and is considering her legal options. FIFA, hamstrung by its own scandals, had to react. It did so in the middle of September when Michel D’Hooghe , the Belgian doctor who heads the FIFA medical committee, led a meeting that decided a new subcommittee was needed to establish rules over how to care for players injured on the field. D’Hooghe, who early in his career helped save the life of a Dutch player who suffered heart failure during a game in Bruges, Belgium, has spent his life involved in sports medicine and FIFA politics. After he led the meeting that was called over how Mourinho effectively banned the team doctor, D’Hooghe said, “The most important thing a doctor faces is that where he or she has to judge on a medical issue, they cannot hesitate.” The doctors, he said, must abide by their oath and intervene when a player needs assistance. However, the subcommittee — which will take time to organize, given how fractured FIFA is right now — will consult with coaches and managers as it makes its decision. “We also need the voice of the coaches when we draw up this code,” D’Hooghe said. “It is important to take into account the fact that the doctors work as part of a group under the coach.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:42:11.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
