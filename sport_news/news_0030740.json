(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) PHELAN M. EBENHACK â€” AP \n1. LSU (3): Tigers continue to just win. As long as Leonard Fournette is healthy, LSU will be in every game. \n2. Texas A&M (4): Aggies offense continues to click. \n3. Alabama (5): Who said the Nick Saban Era at Bama is over? \n4. Florida (7): How 'bout the flu-ridden Gators? Would have loved to see what a healthy squad could accomplish. \n5. Ole Miss (1): Rebels couldn't have played much worse Saturday. Their weak OL was really exposed. \n6. Mississippi State (6): There won't be many teams that can limit the Aggies to 30 points. \n7. Georgia (2): On the bright side, Nick Chubb's 13th straight 100-yard game bested Herschel Walker's record. \n8. Kentucky (8): It took OT, but UK topped that scrappy bunch from Eastern Kentucky. \n9. Missouri (10): No Maty Mauk needed as Tigers devour USC. Saban is alive and well at Bama; but what about Spurrier? \n10. Arkansas (12): Maybe this win rights the ship for the Hogs. \n11. Tennessee (9): Another week, another lead lost. \n12. Auburn (11): Auburn really showed San Jose State who belongs in the SEC right now. \n13. South Carolina (13): Remember when Spurrier held that press conference to say he wasn't going anywhere? \n14. Vanderbilt (14): Best performance of the season yields Vandy a win over a nice MTSU team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:47:29.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
