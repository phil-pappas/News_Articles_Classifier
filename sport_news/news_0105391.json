It shares first place with seventh-ranked Eastern Washington.\nSince losing their first two games, the Thunderbirds have been unstoppable. They have consecutive wins over Northern Colorado, Brevard College, Weber State and Sacramento State. The combined margin: 173-10.\nIn last week's 44-0 victory over Sacramento State, senior quarterback Ammon Olsen threw for 421 yards and five touchdowns.\nAccording to Southern Utah coach Ed Lamb, however, all the lopsided wins don't mean anything against UC Davis.\n  \"If we start thinking in terms of trying to win 44-0, we're likely to lose 44-0,\" he said. \"We just have to take care of what we do on offense, defense and special teams.\"\nRecalling the Aggies' 21-3 win over the Thunderbirds in 2013, senior defensive end James Cowser said, \"I'm winless against UC Davis in my career — never beat them. They came to our home [two years ago] and smacked us. They ran it right down our throat and there was nothing we could do about it. That's a game that sticks out in my mind as a frustration.\"\n-\nSouthern Utah at UC Davis\nAt Aggie Stadium\nKickoff • 5 p.m. MDT\nTV • none\nRadio • 590-AM\nRecords • Southern Utah 4-2, 3-0; UC Davis 1-6, 0-3\nSeries • UC Davis, 11-6\nLast meeting • UC Davis, 21-3 (2013)\nAbout the Thunderbirds • They have won four straight. … They are ranked 28th in this week's Football Championship Subdivision national poll. … They have scored on 21 of 23 trips into the red zone (91 percent).
