I think there’s probably at least a dozen stations in this new lab, so that alone is just really nice.” \nThe new building, called the Plastics Engineering Company Center for Engineering Studies, officially opened this semester to students in UW-Sheboygan's collaborative engineering program with the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. A dedication ceremony for the building was held Thursday, Oct. 1. \nThe 7,200-square-foot building, which cost some $1.4 million, provides mechanical and electrical engineering labs, a projects lab, classroom space, group study areas and three offices. It also boasts new, advanced equipment including a wind tunnel, pump test trainer, flow meter loop and an electrical dynometer. \nStudents now have access to state-of-the-art equipment instead of making do with equipment like the apparatus Steve Gehling, a lecturer for the program, built to teach students properties of various metals and plastics. \n\"I built something in my garage that wasn't so good,\" Gehling said. \"We learned, but it's not as nice as having the proper equipment.\" Buy Photo \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Sheboygan student Martha Steffen explains how a fluid circuit demonstrator works Thursday, Oct. 1, during the dedication ceremony for the new Plastics Engineering Company Center for Engineering Studies on the UW-Sheboygan campus.
