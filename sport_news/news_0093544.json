Alabama gets a false start and then Coker gets sacked to doom the drive. Scott had a beautiful punt to give the Vols the ball on its 10-yard line. \n--Eddie Jackson returned to the game for Tennessee's first second-half drive. He missed most of the first half with an injury. \n--Coker finds Stewart for a 26-yard gain to give Alabama first-and-goal from Tennessee's 8-yd line. The next play Coker hits O.J. Howard who gets down to the 1-yard line, but Alabama can't punch it in on its next two plays. Alabama settles for a 19-yard field goal. \n--Alabama offense with some momentum to start the half. Heavy dose of Henry to start things off and then two first-down passes to Ridley and Richard Mullaney, respectively. \n--Alabama starts with the ball at its own 25-yard line. \nSECOND QUARTER: Alabama 7, Tennessee 7 \n--Tennessee outgained Alabama 102-40 on the ground in the first half. Jalen Hurd had 65 yards on 11 carries -- only five yards shy of the average amount of rushing yards Alabama has given up per game this season. \n--Aaron Medley missed a 51-yard field goal to end the first half. The Tide will get the ball to start the second half. \n--Tennessee has the ball on Alabama's 33-yard line with four seconds remaining in the first half.

He replaced starting safety Eddie Jackson who went down with an apparent knee injury earlier in the game and hasn't returned. Harrison was walked straight to the locker room with the help of trainers. \n--A Kenyan Drake unsportsmanlike penalty ends Alabama's drive and forces another JK Scott penalty.

Dobbs made another poor throw, but Reuben Foster couldn't intercept it. The Volunteers punted for the third time in the first half. \n--Jake Coker throws his first interception of the game. He telegraphed his throw and Brian Randolph jumped the route. It is his first interception since the Arkansas game and seventh of the season. \n--Josh Dobbs made a very poor throw but Ronnie Harrison couldn't come down with the interception. Still, Tennessee was forced to punt. \n--Alabama's drive stalled on the 50-yard line after left tackle Cam Robinson got beat and Coker was sacked. The Volunteers have two sacks and two QB hurries early in the first half. \n--Tennessee will start the second quarter with 2-and-12 on its own 18-yard line. Alabama forces the Vols to punt after a sack backed them up. It was a shaky punt but a fortunate roll backs the Tide up to its 33-yard line. \nFIRST QUARTER: Alabama 7, Tennessee 7 \n-- Alabama was moving ball fairly well on its drive but after Jake Coker gets sacked, faces a 3rd-and-20 on Tennessee's 46-yd line.

Tennessee ran 10 plays for 75 yards and ate up 4:14 of clock on that drive. Dobbs looking good early against Alabama and has done a nice job, for the most part, of evading pressure. \n-- Tennessee, like most teams, hasn't had much success trying to run through the middle of the field against Alabama, but has made a few nice plays either running out wide or throwing to running backs in the flats. \n-- After attempting to test out his knee with a brace, safety Eddie Jackson headed to the locker room with trainer Jeff Allen. \n-- Henry broke through at least two tackles for a 20-yard touchdown run to get Alabama on the scoreboard first. When he gets churning, he's very difficult to take down. The offensive line got the job done, as well. \n-- Derrick Henry gets the ball on Alabama's first offensive play. A Tennessee defensive penalty gives Alabama the ball at the 40-yard line. \n-- After a Reuben Foster sack pushes the Vols back, Tennessee missed a 43-yard field goal. \n-- Safety Eddie Jackson, who leads the SEC with five interceptions, suffered an apparent right knee injury and left the game. \n- Tennessee will start its first drive at its own 25-yard line. \nPREGAME \n--Alabama won the toss and deferred to the second half.

Howard and Jonathan Allen were Alabama's three team captains. \n--Former Tennessee great Peyton Manning made the trip to Bryant-Denny Stadium and was walking the sidelines before the game. \nNick Saban told ESPN's Joe Schad that center Ryan Kelly has been cleared to play today.
