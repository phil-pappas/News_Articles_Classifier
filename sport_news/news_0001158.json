Texas Southern tied it after a fumble on a punt return set up a short field for Brad Woodard’s 2-yard run. \nSouthern’s first offensive drive resulted in a 3-yard touchdown run by Tillery, and he added another — a 2-yard plunge — to put the Jaguars up 21-7 with 1:55 left in the first quarter. \nTexas Southern (3-4, 2-4) responded, as Larry Clark III’s 54-yard touchdown catch and Malik Cross’ 18-yarder tied the game at 21 at halftime. \nIn the third, Southern added a short field goal by Gregg Pittman, and a blocked punt resulted in a safety. Touchdown runs by Deonte Shorts and John West iced the win.
