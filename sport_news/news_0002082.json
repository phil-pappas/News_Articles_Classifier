(Charles Krupa / Associated Press) Jeff Jacobs: Patriots made the plays that mattered in win over division rival Jets \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. — He didn't see his quarterback. He only saw the football. \nAnd that was enough for Rob Gronkowski, enough to provide the difference on the scoreboard, enough to show the Jets and everybody else that even on a day when they dropped so many passes the Patriots would not drop their chance to remain unbeaten. \n\"I actually couldn't even see Tom,\" Gronkowski said of his 15-yard touchdown catch with 73 seconds left in a 30-23 victory at Gillette Stadium. \"The defensive linemen that were chasing after him are huge. I just saw the ball come out and it was, 'Here it comes!' \" \nThe Jets blitzed Brady plenty on Sunday. Their defense has a knack for knowing when to bring it, when not to bring it, how to mix it up to always make it a close, violent game against the Patriots. \n\"I was in pass protection a lot,\" Gronk said. \"There was a lot of blitz-zero. I just leaked out there on that play. Tom saw it. I was wide open. I just had to run it in. Good, smart football.\" (JIMMY GOLEN) \nYou've heard it a million times, and you'll hear it a million more times. It comes down to making plays. The Jets made enough plays to demonstrate that, yes, the Patriots can be beaten. For much to the first half, they were so effective on defense and controlling the ball on offense that one was left to observe that the Jets did a much better job of keeping Brady off the field than Roger Goodell ever did. \nThe Patriots were up 13-10 at halftime and the last time they lost at home when leading at intermission is December 2000. Yet they also were behind (17-16) for the first time this season after three quarters. \n\"It's always tough playing the Jets,\" Gronk said. \"They play hard. They play fast. They play physical. Obviously, our offense wasn't clicking the whole time. We can't be having so many three-and-outs. But we struck together and the fourth quarter, we just dug deep, stepped up. Tom was on point. We executed as a unit.\" \nThat's the thing. The Jets may have made enough plays to challenge the Patriots, but when it mattered most the Patriots made the plays that showed — and this is no convenient hyperbole — that they could go 16-0 in 2015. \nAt 6-0, the Patriots — also 6-0 in 2004 and 2007 — have a perfect record. But this was anything but a perfect performance. Patriots receivers dropped 11 passes. Brandon \"LaDrop\" LaFell, in his first game back on the active roster, dropped six passes. \n\"If I had to give myself a grade, it would be an F,\" LaFell said. \nThe Patriots' running game? It was essentially nonexistent. Brady threw the ball 54 times for 355 yards. He ran the ball four times for 15 yards. Against that nasty Jets front, and without Dion Lewis, Brady handed off only five times to LeGarrette Blount and James White for, get this, one yard. \n\"I should enjoy this, because it will probably never happen again,\" said Brady, when asked about leading his team in rushing for the first time in his career. \nBrady did make those 15 rushing yards count, scrambling for 11 yards on third-and-10 to the Jets 2 and then scoring on a sneak in the second quarter. Yet it was Brady's arm, his poise, his will in the final 15 minutes that would ultimately topple the Jets. Yes, Gang Green you are good enough to make the playoffs. You just aren't good enough to topple the Patriots as Forever Kings of the AFC East. \nOnce they stopped dropping the ball, the Patriots dropped the anvil. Brady was 13 for 24 in the first half for 122 yards and three sacks. In the fourth quarter alone, he was 13 for 17 and 150 yards. When it was over, Brady had become the fifth NFL quarterback in history to surpass 55,000 passing yards. \nThose numbers are great, but it is the ability to convert at the right moment, to make necessary adjustments, to, yes, make The Play that distinguishes Brady and the Patriots. \n\"You can't worry,\" Gronkowski said of being down the in fourth quarter. \"You've got to remain level-headed.\" \n\"If something bad happens,\" Danny Amendola said of all the drops, \"you've just got to focus on the next play.\" \nGronkowski set a career mark with 11 catches, but the truth is Amendola was the receiver who came up the biggest. And from there one can argue the biggest catch of the game was by Julian Edelman on third-and-17 when the Patriots were down 20-16. \nEdelman was positively crushed by cornerback Buster Skrine earlier in the game and perhaps still seeing three footballs instead of one later dropped a touchdown pass. Yet on a play that Bill Belichick identified as split-safety coverage, there was Edelman pulling in a 27-yard reception across the middle with just over 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter. \n\"He was running full speed at the safety and he finally got him to turn his hips,\" Brady said. \"I was reading Jules and he broke across his body and let it go. He made a real smart play. It's not exactly how we drew it up, but there were a lot of plays like that today that weren't exactly how we drew it up.\" \nThe Patriots spread it out and went with an empty backfield. They altered pace. You play the Jets, who were hampered on offense by running back Chris Ivory's hamstring problems, and it's always a game of cat and mouse. A very violent game of cat and mouse. Guys were getting lit up all over the place. \n\"Those dudes are big and those dudes are fast,\" Gronk said of the Jets. \nMaybe the collisions led to so many drops on both sides. Brandon Marshall dropped a pass in the end zone for the Jets, too. Amendola was the outlier on this day. His hands were glue. Five of his eight catches came in the fourth quarter. Brady found him open across the middle for an 8-yard TD pass. Sure enough, Marcus Gilchrist upended him hard, but when he landed just over the goal line with 7:16 left it also was 23-20 New England. \n\"Danny made some great plays,\" Belichick said. \nIn the drive that culminated with Gronkowski's final score, Amendola made a terrific leaping catch. Where'd he get that kind of vertical? \n\"Game jump,\" Amendola said. \n\"Amendola is always making crazy, acrobatic catches,\" Gronk said. \"He looks like a gymnast half the time. Last year, he had that one against the Jets. He can jump super quick.\" \nIn the end, one was left with what may be an unanswerable question. Do the Patriots simply have too many weapons to stop, or do they have so many weapons because of a seemingly unending ability to make a play when it matters most? Or maybe it is answerable. Maybe it's Brady. \n\"I just think there has got to be different ways to win every week and we always try to figure out ways to attack teams,\" Brady said. \n\"We tried to switch things up on Tom,\" said Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis, who was greeted with boos on his return Gillette Stadium. \"We tried to show him different looks, but Tom is great. He suckered in the defense. That's what he did down the stretch.\" \nNick Folk hit a 55-yard field goal with 18 seconds left and the Jets looked like they had one prayer left when Marshall recovered Folk's onside kick. But Ryan Fitzpatrick, a Harvard man, somehow decided to complete a pass in the middle of the field to Eric Decker instead of going to the end zone or at least to the sidelines to stop the clock. Marshall dogged it back to the line of scrimmage and the Jets took a false start penalty to end the game. \nThat's called not making a play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:49:53.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
