He's the unquestioned leader of the team both on and off the ice and is one of the more consistent left-wingers in the league.\nAnd yet, there he was Wednesday as the Jets prepared to depart for the season opener in Boston, talking about cutting off contract talk with the media for sure and possibly shutting down negotiations with the team entirely once the real games begin.\n“I don’t know,” he said. “I haven’t decided yet. Whatever is going to allow me to concentrate on hockey and is best for the team is the way I’m gonna go. I’ll decide that myself.”\nLadd is not alone. Defenceman Dustin Byfuglien will also be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2015-16 season. But getting the captain's name on a contract extension has always seemed like a foregone conclusion, while Byfuglien's future is much more cloudy.\nIt would not have surprised many people if Byfuglien was traded during the off-season. He's still considered by many around the league to be the most likely NHL player to be traded during the season.\nLadd is another story entirely, and all we know is contract talks have not progressed.\n“We’re still in the same spot,” he said. “For me, after this point I’m probably not going to answer any more questions about it. We don’t need that distraction in here so we’ll just leave that where it is.”\nNo one outside of Ladd, his agent and the Jets knows exactly what the hold up is here.\nThe Jets have already begun a youth movement, with an influx of draft picks working their way into the lineup over the last few seasons, so maybe Ladd and the hefty salary he will command don't fit into the big picture.\nMaybe Ladd himself wants to experience unrestricted free agency.\nMaybe it's the dollar figure or the term, or both.\nNo matter what, starting the final year of his deal without an extension -- especially if he chooses to shut down negotiations during the season -- could be a shocking sign that this hockey marriage is on the rocks.\nAlthough Ladd is worried about becoming a distraction, Jets coach Paul Maurice said his captain's contract status is a non-issue as far as the on-ice product goes.\n“It wouldn’t change one thing about my day,” Maurice said. “A player is here or he’s not. He doesn’t play more, he doesn’t play less. Nothing changes with Andrew Ladd as the captain of our team.\n\"From my point of view, I’ve never worried about what a guy makes, I don’t care how long his contract is. That doesn’t affect me. Andrew was asked to do things in terms of leadership because of the way he handles himself and handles the room. He earned it. He became a leader and he became the captain of the team for the qualities that he showed. I don’t think that changes anything at all. I’ve never seen a guy who is going into the last year of his contract be casual about his performance.”\nLadd was the first player to arrive in Winnipeg when the team moved from Atlanta, the first to sign a long-term contract to stay with the organization. He's proven himself as a leader and the kind of player this organization wants and needs to be successful.\nHe's still only 29 and has plenty of good years ahead of him.\nThe Jets are said to have the finest stable of prospects in the NHL and are viewed as a team that will contend for the Stanley Cup in a few years.\nWho better than Ladd to lead them?\nWinnipeg Jets captain Andrew Ladd not sure if he'll shut down contract talks\nBy Ted Wyman , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 07, 2015 01:01 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, October 07, 2015 05:03 PM EDT\nWinnipeg Jets captain Andrew Ladd hasn’t decided if he’ll keep talking to the team about a new contract once the season starts Thursday.\nLadd is heading into the last year of his contract and can be an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2016. He says he doesn’t plan to answer questions from the media about his contract situation after this point and isn’t sure whether he’ll shut down negotiations with the team.\n“I don’t know,” he said as the Jets had their final practice before Thursday’s season opener in Boston. “I haven’t decided yet. Whatever is going to allow me to concentrate on hockey and is best for the team is the way I’m gonna go. I’ll decide that myself.”\nLadd said contract talks have not progressed during the pre-season.\n“We’re still in the same spot,” he said. “For me, after this point I’m probably not going to answer any more questions about it. We don’t need that distraction in here so we’ll just leave that where it is.”\nAbout the author Ted Wyman Ted Wyman's Blog Follow Ted Wyman on Twitter Other Stories Winnipeg Jets have to stick to system and earn their way back into playoffs\nIf we learned one thing about the Winnipeg Jets last season, it was that getting to the playoffs isn't easy and winning once you get there is an even greater task.\n0\nTed Wyman's Top 50 NHL Players Of 2015-16\nThe 2015-16 NHL season is here.
