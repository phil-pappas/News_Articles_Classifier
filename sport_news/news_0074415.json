' /> </a> </div> <span id=\"dateline\"><strong>SWEETWATER, Tenn. (WVLT) --</strong></span> Linda Burklund is suiting Schott Gemtron Corporation for unlawful retaliation under the Tennessee Disabilities Act, age and sex discrimination, and for breach of contract. Burklund says she was let go after refusing to fire a fellow employee with cancer.\nBurklund was hired to serve as the vice president, finance and CFO in January 2014. She reported to Christian Mias and her human resources director was Sharon Anderson.\nCourt documents say Mias and Anderson discriminated against a 65-year-old employee who reported to Burklund. That employee had cancer and was receiving treatments.\nThe documents also claim Mias and Anderson pressured Burklund to fire the employee because the employee's health and medical treatments were negatively impacting the company. It points to one conversation in which Mias told Burklund the employee was driving up the company's medical costs and \"Burklund needed to stop standing in the way of her termination.\"\nBurklund claims when she refused to create reasons to fire the employee, the employee was removed from her direct supervision and placed under the supervision of the controller.\nThe lawsuit documents say Anderson told Burklund that the employee was going to be fired that day and Burklund needed to be at the meeting. Burklund refused, saying it was wrongful termination. The employee was fired anyway.\nThe next month, Burklund was let go and was told it was because she didn't make the necessary improvements and didn't have the right \"persona\" to be a CFO.\nBurklund claims a younger, male employee was promoted to her position the same day she was let go.\nBurklund also claims she was paid less than other male employees in similar positions.\n</div> <div id=\"storyFeatures\" class=\"row-fluid\"> </div>", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/gavel.mgn.jpg", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/gavel.mgn.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:09:03.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
