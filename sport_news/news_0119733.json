They have metallic chips that pass a unique transaction code to the merchant. Analysts say these new cards are much harder to copy and will cut down on fraudulent charges.\nBanks have already been sending out millions of new debit and credit cards. However, reports show that half of credit or debit card users in the United States still have not received a new card. It seems that making the switch may not be so easy.\nSo what happens to your current debit or credit card with a magnetic strip? Don’t worry, these cards will still work until it expires or until a new card is ordered.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
