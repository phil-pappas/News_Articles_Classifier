So, “570” stands for 570 metric horsepower? What happens next year when the engine output goes up, as it inevitably does? Will the model designation for this two-seat, midengine berlinetta change or will it just grow more frankly inaccurate?\nBut, what about the fact that Brits have traditionally used brake-horsepower while we in the States, McLaren’s biggest market, use SAE net horsepower? You know how literal Americans are.\nNo consideration of my name suggestion: Cosmic Interceptor?\nA rose by any other. The 570S is a compelling and unexpected set of choices from the British arrowsmith, a car that dares to dial back the technical overkill in its big brother, the 650S, in favor of, yes, a more affordable sports car but also a sweeter, more fluid, more rewardingly free driving experience. Not as needy and flamboyant as the 650S (though it does have the doors that go “ka-ching”) and mercifully more ergonomic from the driver’s seat, the 570S sheds the extraneous and keeps the vital (standard carbon-ceramic brakes, for instance), welding it all into a spare, voracious, and eminently usable midengine tourer.\n2016 McLaren 570S ENLARGE Photo: McLaren Automotive Base price: $184,900\nPrice, as tested: $200,000 (est)\nPowertrain: midmounted, twin turbocharged 3.8-liter DOHC V8 with variable valve timing and stop/start; seven-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox with Automatic mode; rear-wheel drive with limited slip diff and brake-based torque vectoring\nHp/torque: 592 hp at 7,400 rpm/443 lb-ft at 5,000-6,500 rpm\nLength/weight: 178.5 inches/3,100 lbs (est)\n0-60 mph: 3.1 seconds\n0-124 mph: 9.5 seconds\nTop speed: 204 mph\nEPA: 16/23/19 mpg, city/hway/comb\nFront stowage: 5 cubic feet\nThis playground is called Luxury Sports Car, and the players include the Audi R8 V10 FSI , with one of the few remaining naturally aspirated performance engines; the Porsche 911 Turbo S ; and the so-far chimerical Acura NSX .\nWith the introduction of the 570S, McLaren has three legs to its product stool: The Sport Series, like the 570S, which you can pick up well appointed for under $200,000; the Super Series, including the all-vanquishing 650S, with coupe, spider and longtail (675LT) specification for about $250,000-$350,000; and the Ultimate Series, the imperium where lives the $1.2-million P1 hypercar and derivatives, like the track-only P1 GTR. Stand by those carbon-fiber drool buckets.\nWith total production limited to 4,000 cars annually, the business case calls for the Sport division to tick over at about 2,500 units, more or less, annually and forever. To do that the entry-level car must reach beyond a clientele of rich lads with relationship problems.\nIt’s a fact: Fashionably dressed women, drivers or passengers, have a hell of a time getting in and out of exotic sports cars. Such cars are low, with constrained door apertures and wide thresholds that require a knickers-baring straddle to reach the seats (e.g., Ferrari 488 GTB, Mercedes-AMG GT S). My wife, to name a conspicuous example, hates these sorts of cars.\nMore McLaren Reviews McLaren: The Greatest Car You’ll Never Drive (3/14/14) The Best Sports Car, and Why to Skip It (2/19/11) To make access to the 570S more agreeable, McLaren modified its signature carbon-fiber passenger cell, or tub, narrowing and cutting down the height of the door thresholds and having them slope away from the occupants to make room for complicated footwear. This concession to couture required no small amount of re-engineering, since the central tunnel had to be reinforced to compensate for the loss of structure laterally.\nAlong the same lines, the dihedral hinged doors do an admirable job of clearing their openings, to make seating approach easier and more graceful. The downside is that the upswung door can reach out to hit objects like toll machines and garage pillars. Remember to look up as well as out.\nThe net is a midengine exotic that’s more approachable than the 650S, even for passengers with a low coefficient of dress.\n‘ The 570S is more affordable than the 650S, and it’s sweeter, too. ’\nThe 570S is a markedly different driving animal than the 650S, but the opposition is not feminine and masculine but Apollonian and Dionysian. The 650S is about scalpel-sharp dissection of lap times, bringing a host of exotic technologies to bear: active aerodynamics, magnetic dampers, and McLaren’s trick hydraulic antiroll plumbing (the 570S uses anti-roll bars). Not to mention the 650S costly/priceless carbon-composite body construction.\nThe 570S, while based on McLaren’s carbon-fiber tub, doesn’t have any of that gear. It is a more conventional and a simpler machine. But it’s absolutely the more fun car, the more spirited car. Jeez. It’s not even close. The truth is, manhandling the 650S anywhere outside a closed circuit is a bit of a grim affair because the limits are so surreal.\nLacking the invisible hand of active aero downforce to hold it steady, the 570S slides cheerfully and fearlessly, yielding and grabbing traction at both ends, slithering under braking and pivoting under power, like a proper British sports car should. Steering is taut and heavy but not too busy. The brake pedal is strangely numb but the carbon-ceramic discs themselves hugely powerful.\nI see you, tongues hanging out, waiting for the red meat, you primitives. Come get it: The 570S is powered by a slightly dialed back version of the same 3.8-liter twin-turbo that powers the 650S to its 650 hp. Channeled through a slightly recalibrated Graziano 7-speed dual-clutch and through the torque-vectoring rear diff, and with the aid of launch control, the 570S hits 60 mph in 3.1 seconds, and that’s with a bit of a turbo stutter coming out of the blocks.\nOnce rolling the 570S is poised to completely empty your coffee cup with forward acceleration: 0-124 mph streams by in a hectic 9.5 seconds. The overtaking power is hilarious and on Spanish byways many of the people you pass will be cheering you on.\nThe powertrain software privileges linearity in rpm and power output, so the harder you put your foot down the more insistently the power gathers at your back. In this state of tune this engine makes max torque (443 pound-feet) between 5,000-6,500 rpm and doesn’t make full power until a soaring 7,400 rpm. That makes for quite the eventful second gear.\nAfter several hours battling monsoon conditions I formed a real alliance with the 570S. Yes, it has more ride and roll compliance, slightly higher ride height, more wheel travel and slightly narrower tires, and I was glad of it. It saved me a couple of times when we went through some deep and unmarked depressions in the roadway. Had I’d hit those in a 650S I’d have knocked its carbon-fiber teeth out.\nIs the 570S less car than the 650S? Sure. The lesser car?
