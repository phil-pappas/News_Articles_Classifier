He laughs again as he races toward the hoop for a layup, and later again as he works on his post moves, using his tiny body to back his dad under the rim.\nFor a minute, Josh and Megan Gibson forget their worry.\nThat always seems to happen when a basketball is around.\nCarefree moments in the driveway. Game nights in front of the TV. And, of course, the time JP Gibson — a little boy from Layton who had spent more of his life battling leukemia than not — was lifted, basketball in hand, to the rim and into a community's conscience.\n  \"It's helped us forget about cancer for a while, \" Megan Gibson said.\nOn Friday night, a year after JP Gibson spent a day as a member of the Utah Jazz, the 6-year-old was back at EnergySolutions Arena to attend the team's open practice.\nHe was vibrant and healthy and cancer-free since May.\nAnd his parents again forgot to worry for a little while.\nIn the year since JP's storybook night went viral, he's made SportsCenter's Top 10 and appeared on \"Ellen.\" At basketball games now, fans shout his name when they see him. They put out their hands for high-fives. They ask if they can treat him to a souvenir.\nThese are the perks of celebrity, and Megan Gibson jokes that she worries about her superstar's lofty expectations for what lies ahead for him.\n\"In his 6-year-old mind, everybody knows who he is,\" she said with a laugh.\nThe outpouring of support — the gifts, love and prayers — has been overwhelming.\n\"We're super grateful,\" Megan Gibson said. \"But if we could trade it all to not have cancer, we would do it in a heartbeat.\"\nThe first signs came on a game day.\nFrom an early age, JP loved to sit with his father and root for his old man's favorite teams. \"He's never been a normal kid. He's always watched sports and paid attention to the whole game,\" said Josh Gibson\nThat game day, Super Bowl Sunday 2012, Josh and JP Gibson were rooting for the New York Giants. JP had a fever, though nobody thought much of it. Other signs followed, but they could be explained away, too.\nJP would hardly eat, didn't touch chicken nuggets, pizza or even macaroni and cheese. But he played and played, so he must have been OK. He wanted to be held more often, but jealousy is normal when a family welcomes its second child. One night, the neighbors said JP looked pale. But didn't the kid with bleach-blond hair and blue eyes always look pale?\nJosh and Megan searched the Internet for \"my pale toddler,\" and winnowed their son's condition down to two options. Deep down, they knew it wasn't anemia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:16:05.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
