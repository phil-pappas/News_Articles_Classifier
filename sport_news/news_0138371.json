He punched the animal until it let go, screamed for help and was assisted to shore by another surfer and a kayaker, his family told reporters. \nRescuers used a surfboard leach as a tourniquet on Cook's leg until paramedics arrived. Doctors at Queens Medical Center in Honolulu later completed the amputation on his leg, Chris Webster, Cook's cousin, told KHON 2, a Hawaii television station. \n\"During the attack, the shark got him below the knee ... but they had to take his leg above the knee so that was a little heart-breaking,\" Webster told the television station. Cook's left hand was also injured. \nCook is a native of Rhode Island who moved to Hawaii three years ago and learned to create custom surfboards, according to Hawaii News Now. \nThe attacked occurred about 10:30 a.m. near a popular surfing area known asLeftovers Beach Park. It was the fifth shark attack in Hawaii this year. \nLifeguards in the area were warning visitors to stay out of the ocean, and signs have been posted along the beach, according to the Associated Press.
