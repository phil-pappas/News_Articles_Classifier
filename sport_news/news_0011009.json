The Mariners beat the Lions 48-10. \nRockland — The Oceanside football team is headed to the playoffs and will carry a dominating final regular-season performance into that postseason contest. \nThe Mariners ended their campaign on Friday night, Oct. 23 with a strong 48-10 high school gridiron win over Belfast on Wasgatt Memorial Field. \nAdditional information, video and link to more photos from this game will appear later with this story. See more photos below. \nOceanside finished with a .500 season and has qualified for the postseason. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Crabtree Point Standings for Class C North, Oceanside (4-4, 100.0000 points) finished tied for fifth with Foxcroft Academy of Dover-Foxcroft (4-4, 100.0000 points) and the schools had a coin flip to determine which would fill the fifth and sixth (final) spots for the postseason. \nThe Ponies won the flip, said Oceanside athletic director Molly Bishop. \nThus, the Mariners ended sixth and will play at No. 3 Mount Desert Island (6-2, 124.2063 points) on Friday, Oct. 30 at 7 p.m. in a playoff clash. \nThe Trojans beat the Mariners 42-13 in a home game during the regular season. \nIf Oceanside had finished fifth, it would have traveled to face Madison/Carrabec (4-4, 104.8387 points) in the first playoff contest. The Mariners opened the season with a 35-18 loss to host Madison/Carrabec. \nFriday's playoff game will give the Mariners an opportunity for redemption from that regular-season loss to the Trojans. However, MDI is strong, having only lost to the top two teams in the region — Winslow and Old Town. \nThis season, the Mariners, who rebounded with a 4-2 record after losing their first two games, were outscored by opponents 254-214, but that is made to look worse due to a 68-0 loss to Winslow. \nMDI outscored opponents 257-137 this season. \nAgainst Belfast on Friday, the Mariners grabbed the momentum early and played four solid quarters of football. Oceanside led 23-10 at halftime. \nThe Lion points came on a safety when the Mariner punter stepped on the back line of the end zone and on a touchdown catch following a blocked punt. \nThe Mariners had many highlights, including a long touchdown catch by Riley Sprague. \nBelfast finished 3-5 on the season and out of playoff contention.
