They will have to leave Afghanistan, but they will damage the peace process through these tactics,\" he said.\nThomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, said Afghan troops needed more support, but he added: \"The war cannot be won, otherwise 140,000 US and other troops should have won it. Conclusion? The solution must be political.\"\n\"THEY SHOULD STAY\"\nGhani's national unity government with Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah has come under growing strain in the crisis, particularly in the wake of the fall of Kunduz and ongoing attacks in the capital Kabul.\nFor some Afghans, Obama's move was welcome.\n\"As the war continues all over Afghanistan, the presence of US troops is hugely needed and they should stay here,\" said Kabul resident Haji Fahim.\nBut there was little optimism among Western analysts and diplomats that the troop contingent would do much to reverse a deteriorating situation, given the lack of a peace process.\nWithout talks involving neighbouring powers including Pakistan, blamed by many Afghans for backing the insurgency, and a sustained assault on corruption which has blighted government, there would be no lasting stability, said Afzal Ashraf, a consultant fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.\nAfghan security forces, theoretically numbering almost 350,000, have suffered heavy combat losses and desertions and still need their international allies.\nUS military support for the Afghan army has been in the spotlight following a deadly US air strike on a hospital in Kunduz run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, prompting calls for tighter controls over such attacks.\nThe Taliban's ability to strike outside its main heartlands in the south and east of the country was amply demonstrated by its success in Kunduz, a region where it has traditionally not been strong.\nIt has also advanced in other areas, cutting off the main highway linking Kabul with the key southern city of Kandahar and threatening the provincial centre of Ghazni this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:57:14.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
