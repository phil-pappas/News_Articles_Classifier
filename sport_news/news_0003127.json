The meet was held at Fort Dodge’s Lakeside Golf Course, which is the site of the Iowa high school state cross country meet Oct. 31. \nIn a field of 17 teams, Newton’s girls finished 13th with 380 points. Urbandale won the girls’ division with 28 points. Newton’s boys scored 518 points and took 17th in a field of 18 teams. Dowling Catholic claimed first place with 37 points. \n“It’s a long haul, but worth it to run on the state course with this competition, and the girls responded well,” Newton girls’ head coach Rachelle Tipton said. Four of the five varsity runners posted personal-best times for the Cardinal girls. \nFreshman Rachel Rhoads continues to lead the Cardinals. She finished 21st in the 5K race in 19 minutes, 45 seconds, a personal best. Also recording their best times were freshmen Caelyn Briley, 21:27, and Abbie Barr, 21:46, to take 68th and 75th, respectively. \nJunior Ellie Horn placed 102nd in 23:40 and junior Katherine Thorpe ran a personal-best time of 25:45 for 110th. Senior Grace Coen gave it another try to get back in running, but did not complete the race. \n“Rachel was hoping for a top 20 finish, but to be 21st at this meet with these teams is incredible. She is running with the best in 4A as a 3A competitor, its exciting,” Tipton said. “Caelyn had a great race, we’ve figured out the strategy for her and look forward to conference. Abbie ran strong, and it was fun for her to break that 22-minute mark, she was so thrilled. \n“Ellie continues to be a strong and reliable middle runner for us; looking to move up some more these last couple meets. Katherine ran tough and notched off more time. While Grace made it further than the last meet, again, she decided she didn’t need to force anything.” \nSophomore Jack Callaghan was Newton’s top runner in the boys’ varsity 5K race. He finished 71st in 17:24 followed by sophomore Michael Bradley in 108th at 18:55 and junior Noah Sander in 109th at 18:58. Sophomore Dylan Main ran 114th in 19:28. \nFreshman Adam Hunter finished 116th in 19:37 and Ross Hull, a sophomore, was 117th in 19:47. Senior Zach Theis placed 124th in 21:06. \nThere were 530 runners in the boys’ junior varsity race. Newton was 17th as a team led by sophomore Bradley Portner, who took 156th in 19:23. \nFreshmen Connor Moon and Larkin Christy were 430th and 434th, respectively, in 22:42 and 22:46. Sophomore Blake Robson finished 446th in 23:00 and junior Spencer Elbert placed 511th in 25.53. \nThe Cardinal girls had three runners in the junior varsity race, which had 352 runners. Sophomore Rylie Bakalar and junior Jordyn Soule, went 270th and 271st, respectively, with the same time, 27:38. Senior Annie Hurt posted a personal-best time of 30:28 for 324th. \n“Rylie and Jordyn have done a great job of pushing each other in the last couple meets, and continue to run awesome for late starts to the season,” Tipton said. “Annie had another outstanding meet, and dropped almost a minute more off her time. She is finishing her senior year strong.” \nThe Newton teams head to Grinnell Monday for the Little Hawkeye Conference meet. Races begin at 4 p.m. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:44:05.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
