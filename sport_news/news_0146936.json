That has become a problem recently as the government has tried to increase spending.\nDeputy Finance Minister Izabela Leszczyna said Thursday the lottery is intended to encourage shoppers to ask for receipts from sellers, leading to less evasion on sales tax.\nThe lottery will run for 12 months. Receipts for purchases of at least 10 zlotys ($2.6) can be registered online with the lottery site and each month consumers can win prizes of cars, laptops or iPads.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:05:08.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
