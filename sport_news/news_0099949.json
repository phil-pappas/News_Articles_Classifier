(Photo: AP) \nNEW YORK — Miami’s Dee Gordon had three hits on the final day of the season to edge Washington’s Bryce Harper for the NL batting title Sunday, and Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera won his fourth AL championship in five years. \nHarper entered with a tiny edge, .330754 to .330606, but Gordon doubled on David Buchanan’s first pitch of the game at Philadelphia, then homered and singled in his next two at-bats. Gordon’s 3-for-4 day lifted his average to .333, while Harper’s fell to .330 when he went 1 for 4 at the New York Mets. \nCabrera, who did not play Sunday, finished at .338 to win by a huge margin in the AL over Boston’s Xander Bogaerts, who was second at .320. \nBaltimore’s Chris Davis homered twice Sunday to finish with 47 and led the major leagues for the second time in three years. Toronto’s Josh Donaldson topped the AL in RBIs (123) and runs (122). \nColorado’s Nolan Arenado and Washington’s Bryce Harper shared the NL home run title at 42. Twenty players hit 30 or more homers, up from 11 last year. \nHarper also led the NL in runs (118), and Gordon topped the league in hits (205) and stolen bases (58), becoming the first NL player to lead in average and steals since Jackie Robinson in 1949. \nHouston’s Jose Altuve led the AL in steals for the second straight year; his total of 38 was the lowest for a league leader since Luis Aparacio of the White Sox had 31 in 1961. \nThe game \nThe Tigers didn’t have much to say about their 6-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Sunday. \nThey are looking to forget about this season as quickly as possible. \nThe Tigers finished a first-to-worst tumble, ending the year in last place in the AL Central after winning the division for four straight years. Most of the talk in the Tigers’ clubhouse was about next year. \n“There were some things that didn’t go the way we hoped, but that’s all in the rearview mirror now,” manager Brad Ausmus said. “I’m honestly looking forward to start to put together … some names and possibilities for 2016.” \nThe Tigers (74-87) were hurt by injuries and shaky pitching in falling to last place for the first time in seven years. \nSunday was different, with the strong pitching of Daniel Norris (3-2) possibly showing a bit of the future. Norris pitched one-hit ball over five innings and Tyler Collins broke open the game with a bases-clearing triple. 1 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1Rq0AAx TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:21:36.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
