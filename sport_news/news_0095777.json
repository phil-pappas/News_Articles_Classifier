Obviously I love the Sox,” said Olynyk, who has Toronto and Red Sox caps in his regular rotation, “but the Jays have been the team I’ve followed since I was young. I followed guys like Carlos Delgado, Vernon Wells, Orlando Hudson . . .”\nNot former Blue Jay 2B-3B-CF Danny Ainge?\n“Yeah,” Olynyk said, flashing his province-wide smile, “that was a little bit before me.”\nOlynyk wasn’t born until 10 years after Ainge, now the Celts’ president of basketball operations, last stepped into the batter’s box for Toronto.\nNow Ainge and coach Brad Stevens are trying to get the 24-year-old to go deep — aka launch more 3-pointers — with a more assertive swing as he enters his third NBA season. It’s rare that a coach has to get on a player to shoot more often, but such is the case here.\nWednesday night in Brooklyn, Olynyk started slowly with an 0-for-2 first half. He then took and hit all four of his shots (two of them treys) after the break in the Celts’ 109-105 preseason win.\nStevens, whose club stayed in town to play the Knicks tonight, said later he thinks Olynyk is coming around toward the way he needs to play, crediting his prominent role on the Canadian national team this past summer with getting him more into the proper frame of mind.\n“I’m definitely trying to stay aggressive,” said Olynyk, who had 11 points in 11 second-half minutes against the Nets. “Playing with the Canada team definitely helps. I went in there and played well, and I’m just trying to carry that over. But, you know, our team here needs everybody to be at their best, and I’m at my best when I’m aggressive, so that’s what has to happen.\n“It’s all about getting into the flow with the team and getting settled in the league, you know, realizing your strengths and weaknesses at this level and capitalizing on them. And this summer helped me, playing against high-level competition and being a key focal point in that offense,” added the Gonzaga product, who had 34 points for Canada against Venezuela in the FIBA Americas Championship. “It was huge. I got to make plays, and that builds confidence and kind of reiterates your skills.”\nHis C’s coaches and teammates have been doing more than a little reiterating, too. But pushing for his offense is not in Olynyk’s hoop nature.\n“I’ve been taught to play basketball the right way, so if stuff comes, I take it. If it doesn’t, you just keep the ball moving,” he said. “But sometimes you’ve got to try to force it a little bit, I guess, and that’s a little bit of a tough line, especially being a point guard growing up and seeing the game like that. But it’s definitely something I’ve got to work on.\n“I think it’s more just letting the game come to you and playing basketball the right way. I mean, if the extra pass is there, I want to make it. I would definitely consider myself an unselfish player, but I guess sometimes you’ve got to be a little more selfish. Like I said, that’s tough. But then I have to realize that that’s what’s going to help the team — help the team be successful.”\nAs a young guard, well before his growth spurt, Olynyk was more of an on-court director than star soloist.\n“For me, it’s always about the team, just trying to make sure the team’s playing at as high a level as it can,” he said. “The goal for me is, you know, growing up I was always told the best players make their teammates better. And if tour team’s better when you’re on the floor, then you’re doing your job — whether you’re scoring, rebounding, passing, playing defense or just being a glue guy. If your team’s better when you’re on the floor, you’re doing your job.”\nNow Olynyk is learning that, based on Celtics’ needs, the job can change — and he has to change. With more NBA seasoning under his belt, he believes he is better equipped to make the needed alterations in his game.\n“When you’re young, it’s a little bit different,” Olynyk said. “You’re almost playing not to make mistakes rather than playing to make plays. I think once you get over that hump, then you’re fine.”\nStevens would love it if Wednesday’s second half was Olynyk’s hump day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:24:44.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
