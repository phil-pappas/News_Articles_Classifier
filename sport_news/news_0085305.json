Hopefully I can enter the top seven or eight (in the world). It is not going to be easy as there is a strong field in Hong Kong.\nThe resurgent Williams currently lies in 14th place, 48 points adrift of the two players holding the number 9 and 10 rankings: Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic and German Angelique Kerber, who is also appearing in Hong Kong.\nWilliams missed out on valuable points when she was eliminated in the second round of the China Open by Ana Ivanovic, but prior to that she won the Wuhan Open.\nThe evergreen Williams won her 700th career singles match on her way to winning the Wuhan event for her 47th WTA singles title.\n\"I don't know if this is a comeback or a come-up, I just want to win matches and tournaments,\" she said.\nApart from Kerber, another top-10 player, Spaniard Garbine Muguruza (No.5), is also features in the competitive Hong Kong field along with former world number one, Serbian Jelena Jankovic and Grand Slam tournament winners Francesca Schiavone and Sam Stosur.\n1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
