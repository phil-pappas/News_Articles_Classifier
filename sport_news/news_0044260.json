The fairway shrinks a lot and that's good, it makes you focus, it's nice to get that feeling especially on a Thursday.\"\nThe British Masters is back on the European Tour schedule for the first time in seven years and Poulter is delighted.\n\"I'm very proud,\" he said. \"There's a lot of work gone on behind the scenes.\n\"I love it. You have got 15,000 guys out there that all want you to play well. Friends and family are out there, faces I haven't seen for a while,\" added the Florida-based professional.\nPoulter has 15 international wins to his name but it is three years since he last tasted victory.\nThe 39-year-old has lots of hosting responsibilities this week and he said it was important for him to completely focus on his golf when he was out on the course.\n\"I tried to do as much as I possibly could in the summer because I was aware that this week was going to be demanding,\" said Poulter.\n\"I tried to reiterate a number of times that I would like to get as much stuff done early so I can do my job this week and my job this week is obviously to win the golf tournament, that's how I can be most effective.\"\n(Editing by Toby Davis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:42:22.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
