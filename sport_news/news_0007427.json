(OLT), Tarrytown, NY to conduct research and develop a therapeutic mattress that would prevent or manage pressure ulcers in patients. The result is Oxy-Mat™ which has now been approved by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for use in hospitals and rehabilitation centers as well as for therapeutic home use. The prevalence, fiscal, and human costs of pressure ulcers in the U.S. are enormous: 2.5 million patients per year are affected by pressure ulcers; costs range from $9.1 - $11.6 billion per year; and 60,000 deaths per years result from pressure ulcers. (Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; http://www.ahrq.gov ).\nThe use of off-loading surfaces on which patients sleep or sit is a significant way that heathcare facilities try to reduce or eliminate pressure ulcers. The purpose of any off-loading clinical surface is to take excessive pressure off of specific areas of the body to prevent pressure ulcers from developing. These mattress, or air cushions for chairs, may be powered so that the patient’s weight is automatically shifted periodically. Any person laying on a bed or sitting in a chair for prolonged time periods has their blood circulation reduced or cut-off in those areas of the body directly in contact with the bed or chair. A healthy person moves around and shifts weight to help blood circulation. For paralyzed or injured patients who cannot move unassisted or who are very limited in their movement, they cannot shift their weight to ease blood circulation. Over time, this results in pressure ulcers for the paralyzed or injured patient.\nGlenn Butler, CEO of LST, said \"The over-prescription of powered, off-loading mattress systems and other devices may be the largest preventable cost in Healthcare today. Our mattress evaluation and development research indicates that the majority of patients should be on lower-cost, non-powered mattress systems\".\nIn order to help produce a cost-effective and clinically viable off-loading surface, LST compared 16 commercially-available powered, low air loss, and equalizing mattress systems. The Oxy-Mat™ therapeutic, off-loading surface was produced based on results of hundreds of tests on human volunteers, and was then further improved as a result of patient evaluations in field trials.\nGlenn Butler, CEO noted, “For over 50 years, patient-mattress interface pressure has been the primary indicator for mattress selection. Our early research soon made it clear that pressure alone was not a reliable indicator of pressure ulcer risk and that tissue oxygen levels where the only real-time indicator of pressure ulcer risk or development.”\nLST’s novel, patent-pending research approach is detailed in the peer-reviewed, semi-annual journal, Surgical Technology International, in an article titled Oxy-Mat™ Mattress System Development Utilizing Simultaneous Measurement of Interface Pressure and Deep-Tissue Oxygen Saturation. The journal is available in hardcopy and on-line ( http://surgicaltechnology.com ).\nMickey Dyevich, CEO of OLT, remarked, “The Oxy-Mat™ non-powered therapeutic support surface is fast becoming the mattress of choice for comfort, prevention, and treatment of pressure ulcers for a fraction of the cost compared to powered mattress systems.”\nFor more information see:\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality\nhttp://www.ahrq.gov\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\nhttp://www.cms.gov\nSurgical Technology International\nhttp://surgicaltechnology.com\nOff-Loading Technologies, Inc.\nhttp://www.offload-usa.com\nAbout the Life Support Technologies Group (LST)\nhttp://www.lifesupport-USA.com\nThe Life Support Technologies Group (LST) is a Tarrytown, NY-based medical and life-support / life-safety engineering company specializing in Advanced Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine Services to hospitals in the NY-NJ-CT region.
