The game will go into the books as a 21-7 win for Alto, which is what the score was when Matthews' medical emergency occurred. In a story that was first reported by Hughes Ellis of the Henderson Daily News, University Interscholastic League officials, while leaving the final decision up to the respective coaches, required that if the game was to be completed, that it would have to be finished by Monday. With the Alto players and coaches in a deep state of grieving on Monday, playing a football game was never a consideration. Coach Baker explained his decision in not pushing for the contest to have been completed. “These kids are a part of my family, and there's no way I'd put my family on a football field when I had just lost a member of my family,” he said. “I wasn't going to put Alto in that situation. When he (Alto head coach Paul Gould) said he couldn't play (Monday), that was it.” Had Baker and the Indians arrived at Yellowjacket Stadium Monday, suited up and ready to play, and Alto not been able to put a team on the field, Carlisle would have been declared the winner. With the two schools most likely expected to finish first and second in the conference race, Baker's decision could have very well cost his team a district title. But, the long-time Indian mentor had an idea of what the folks at Alto were dealing with and doing the right thing in the game of life trumped any attempt at trying to garner a win on a football field. “We (Carlisle) are struggling a bit right now, and that's understandable,” said Baker. “(But) we're just like any other family, and we'll pull together and fight through it and play football on Friday night. It's how we've always done things.” Carlisle's actions have not gone unnoticed in Alto; that's for sure. “Coach Baker and his group have been a class act through all of this,” Gould stated. A class act indeed.
