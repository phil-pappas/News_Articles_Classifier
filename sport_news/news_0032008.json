Compared to Cardinals/Giants Game 4 on Fox Sports 1 last year, which aired in the same Wednesday night timeslot, overnights increased 69% from a 3.5. \nThe Mets’ series-clinching win had the second-highest overnight of the postseason on any network, trailing only Game 3 of the series the previous night (7.0). Overall, the 5.9 ranks as the second-highest overnight for baseball on cable since 2011 — with the six highest overnights over that span taking place this postseason. \nLocally, Game 4 had an 18.9 rating in Chicago and an 18.8 in New York, both down from Game 3. \nEarlier in the day, Game 5 of the Royals/Blue Jays ALCS had a 2.0 overnight on FS1 — down 43% from Giants/Cardinals last year (3.5) and down 68% from Red Sox/Tigers on FOX in 2013 (6.2), both of which aired on Thursday nights.
