Judging by the Big Sky Conference men’s basketball preseason poll, most experts expect that to happen. \nDespite losing four starters from last year’s NCAA tournament team, the Eagles are picked to finish third behind Montana and Weber State. \n“I would have loved to be picked in the top three my first three years here,” Hayford joked Thursday before a practice session at Reese Court that also served as a sneak peek at this year’s team. \n“I think (the poll) shows some respect for our program,” said Hayford, who returns six letterwinners. \nThat respect was earned partly through last year’s 26-9 season that saw the Eagles knock off Indiana in Bloomington, tie for the Big Sky regular-season title and earn the program’s first NCAA appearance in 11 years. \nAny chance of a repeat rests largely on the shoulders of 6-foot-7 power forward Venky Jois, a first-team all-conference selection a year ago after he averaged 16.7 points and 7.7 rebounds while shooting 61 percent from the field. \nAlong with Bogdan Bliznyuk, last year’s Big Sky Freshman of the Year, Jois is expected to lead one of the best frontcourts in the conference. \n“The talent is definitely there,” said Jois, a senior from Australia. “I think this year we have a chance to do something amazing.” \nThe biggest offseason addition is point guard Austin McBroom, a grad student who played the last two years at Saint Louis. Tasked with replacing Drew Brandon, McBroom said he’s a “pass-first point guard” who said he’s noticed that “I have a lot of shooters on the floor, which is something I’m not used to.” \nThat includes another Australian, small forward Felix Von Hofe, a 6-5 junior who is one of the best pure shooters in the Big Sky. Complementing McBroom in the backcourt is sophomore Sir Washington, who battled through injury last year and is expected to start this year. \nKey reserves in the frontcourt are senior Kyle Reid, redshirt freshman Bear Henderson and true freshman Jess Hunt. In the backcourt, Hayford expects contributions from redshirt freshman Cody Benzel of Spokane, true freshman Michael Wearne from Australia and Julin Harrell, a transfer whom Hayford said “can score in bunches.” \nThe Eagles open the season against Mississippi State on Nov. 13 and play NCAA Division III George Fox in the home opener on Nov. 15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:21:57.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
