(AP) - Two University of Rhode Island football players have been arrested for an alleged assault on several campus fraternity members. \nNineteen-year-old Barrett Lyons of Belmont, Massachusetts, and 20-year-old Michael LeBlanc of Charlton, Massachusetts, are both charged with assault and disorderly conduct. \nPolice arrested them early Sunday morning after a fight at the Chi Phi fraternity. \nPolice say three fraternity brothers were treated at a hospital for broken noses, lacerations and possible broken jaws. \nA URI spokeswoman says one player was removed from the team permanently, two others were suspended pending an investigation and four are suspended from next Saturday’s game as a result of the fight. She declined to provide details. \nThe Providence Journal reports that LeBlanc’s name no longer appears on the football roster. \nIt’s unclear what led to the fight. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:02:46.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
