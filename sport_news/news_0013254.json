Roy, who owned a motorcycle shop and introduced his son to racing at age 3, was discovered under the front loader he was operating.\nBesides his faith and family, Canard said racing helped him cope with his father's death.\n\"One of the big things that really helped me was having something to put my time in, an outlet, and racing was a big part of that,\" he said. \"I had my motorcycle to take out all my frustrations.\"\nRacing as No. 41, his father's old number, Canard quickly climbed the amateur ranks before turning pro and signing with Honda in 2008, when he won the East Coast Lites title to join a select group of riders who have claimed a supercross crown in their rookie year.\nCanard also suffered a broken femur in 2008, the first in a long line of injuries that have plagued him in his career. He broke his arm in 2009, broke his femur twice and broke his collarbone in 2011, broke his back in 2012 and broke his wrist in 2013 and again in March.\nCanard suffered three fractured vertebrae and damage to his spinal cord in a career-threatening accident in January 2012, when Ryan Morais landed on top of him in midair during the supercross stop in Los Angeles. Doctors told Canard, who avoided paralysis, that he'd be out for a year, but he was back on his bike less than eight months later.\n\"The back was definitely the toughest (injury), psychologically, to come back from,\" Canard said. \"(Injuries) never get easier. Each one accumulates, and they get a little more difficult to come back from.\n\"Any time you're dealing with physical pain, it's a really difficult thing. No matter what it is, it is hard to really have a positive attitude and see the bright side of life. There have certainly been times I think, 'This could be it.'\n\"You start to lose hope, but there's always something that kind of keeps pushing me forward. I really feel like I'm on this earth to ride a motorcycle with the talent I have, and I want to use it.\"\nThat talent was on display at last year's MEC, which offers a $1 million prize to any rider who can win all three 10-lap main events. Ryan Villopoto hit the Monster $1 million jackpot in 2011, but no racer had won the first two mains before Canard did so last year.\nCanard was running a close second to eventual MEC champ Davi Millsaps in the final race when he crashed on the fourth lap. He still had a shot to win the event — worth $100,000 to the winner — but crashed again on lap seven and settled for third place overall.\n\"Maybe I was riding a little harder than I had to. I made a mistake just because I wanted to win that race,\" he said. \"It definitely was not a good ending to the night, but overall it was a great experience. Hopefully I can make it all happen this year.\"\n* NOTES — Practice and qualifying for the MEC starts at noon, and the main event begins at 6 p.m., with Fox Sports 2 (319) showing it live at 6:30. ... The field of the world's top racers features reigning supercross champion Ryan Dungey, Millsaps, 2013 MEC champ James Stewart and 2012 MEC champ Justin Barcia.\nContact reporter Todd Dewey at tdewey@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0354.
