Well, since the revenue from those gate receipts became the key source of income for the entire athletic program. Prep football pays the way for just about every other sport played during the school year. \nThere are some that make a little extra cash for the athletic program, but the one that consistently generates the bulk of the dollars is football. \nThings have changed a lot from the time when I went to school at Swain County and West Rowan; that is, there are far more ways to have fun in a safe and dry environment on Friday night instead of sitting under an umbrella in a football stadium. \nThat’s why they move them. They are scraping for every nickel they can get. \nThe rain was good for my picking last week. I went 21-3 to put the total for the year at 119-32, 78.8 percent. \nSeventy-First at South View \nThe Falcons should quickly return to the win column. Seventy-First 35, South View 12 \nGray’s Creek at Westover \nThe Wolverines put up a tough fight before losing to Terry Sanford. I expect them to again tonight. Gray’s Creek 31, Westover 20 \nUnion Pines at Terry Sanford \nThis should be another relatively easy one for the Bulldogs. Terry Sanford 39, Union Pines 8 \nPine Forest at Jack Britt \nPine Forest has quickly become the hardest team for me to figure out this year. Let’s give it one more try. Jack Britt 28, Pine Forest 14 \nLee County at Douglas Byrd \nThe suffering continues for Byrd. Lee County 22, Douglas Byrd 7 \nOverhills at Cape Fear \nLots of potential to get this one wrong. Cape Fear is coming back from a week off. There’s also the rain. I say, let common sense rule.
