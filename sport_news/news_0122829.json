PELZMAN Print \nAt first glance, the Jets’ game against visiting Washington doesn’t seem to have the potential for very much drama. The banged-up Redskins look like little more than a potential speed bump for the improving Jets, who face a showdown at perennial AFC East powerhouse New England a week from today. \nBut upon further review, the game does feature several intriguing subplots. \nLet’s start with the main reason Washington appears to be an easy opponent for the surging Jets. The injury-plagued Redskins will be missing six starters, including two on the offensive line and both of their regular cornerbacks. Worse yet, that injury list includes star wide receiver DeSean Jackson, who will sit out a fifth straight game because of a nagging hamstring injury. \nWashington coach Jay Gruden said Wednesday he was optimistic that Jackson would return to action, but the wideout suffered a setback in practice Thursday and was listed as questionable Friday before being downgraded to out Saturday. \nJackson’s presence would have been huge, considering the Jets’ secondary has had problems containing speed receivers so far this season. \nStill, no-nonsense Jets coach Todd Bowles is making sure his players aren’t thinking about the Patriots, who take a 4-0 record into their game at Indianapolis tonight. \nWhen asked if he believes in so-called \"trap games,\" Bowles replied, \"No, we’re just focused on Washington.\" \nAbout the Jets’ 3-1 record, Bowles said, \"We’ve only played one quarter [of the season]. It’s like a game, the first quarter doesn’t mean you lost the game. [Winning the] first quarter doesn’t mean we got to the playoffs. We’ve got a long way to go. The season is young. You can go from the penthouse to the outhouse real quick.\" \nOne of the Jets certainly should be focused, considering he hasn’t played in a regular-season game since Dec. 28, 2014. Star defensive end Sheldon Richardson sat out the first four games this season because of an NFL-imposed suspension for violating its substance-abuse policy. \n\"He’s sharp mentally,\" Bowles said of Richardson, who was allowed to attend meetings during his suspension but wasn’t permitted to practice. \"He’s been quick. He’s a quick football player. He’s only practiced a couple days. We’ve got to see in a week or two when his legs wear down to see where he is. But, right now he looks good.\" \nRichardson joins a defense that has stopped the opponent on third down 18 consecutive times entering today’s game. \nBowles hasn’t said whether Richardson will start. His place in the lineup has been taken by sixth overall pick Leonard Williams. Washington passed on Williams with the No. 5 pick, despite many experts feeling it had a need at that position. Instead, the Redskins selected Iowa tackle Brandon Scherff, whom they have converted into their starting right guard. \n\"A lot of people ask me if I’m trying to get payback or revenge or anything like that\" against Washington, Williams said, \"but I can’t really say that it’s payback or revenge because they really didn’t do anything to me. They basically just chose what they needed.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:15:11.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
