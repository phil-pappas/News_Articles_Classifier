(AP) - An upcoming memorial service for fallen firefighters in Nashua will include the name of one who died at the scene of a brush fire in 1940.\nSusan Rockwell was researching family history when she came across the details of the death of her grandfather, Chief Engineer William Whitney. She looked into the history of firefighters who had died in the line of duty in Nashua and found he wasn't included.\nRockwell contacted the Nashua Fireman's Relief Association and asked if Whitney's name could be added to the list. The association confirmed the story through its own research and is adding the name, which includes 20 firefighters.\nThe service is scheduled for Sunday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:47:45.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
