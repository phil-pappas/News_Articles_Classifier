Tiger Woods was due to compete this week but has been ruled out until 2016 due to a second back operation. \nAlso in the field is American Scott Stallings, who is free to compete again after serving a three-month suspension for violating the PGA Tour's anti-drug policy. \nStallings reported himself to the Tour after realising a supplement he had been taking to combat chronic fatigue was prohibited. \nThe 30-year-old, who was ranked 154th in the world at the time of his ban but is now 209th, was advised by his doctor to take DHEA, an anabolic agent that is the precursor to testosterone production, but did not produce a positive test at the Humana Challenge in January. \nStallings said in July: \" I regret my inadvertent mistake in not doing my homework to know for sure what was on the list of permitted and non-permitted substances. I take responsibility and accept the penalty imposed by the PGA Tour.''
