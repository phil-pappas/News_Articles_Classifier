Dozens of mourners were also taken into preventive custody.\nA group of Shia mourners first emerged at Habbakadal and indulged in stone-pelting but was chased away by the police and paramilitary personnel, the officials said.\nHours later, a bigger group appeared at Shuthrashahi on the rear side of the Civil Secretariat building and started marching towards Dalgate.\nHowever, the procession was stopped by the police leading to clashes between the two sides, the officials said, adding that the police burst half a dozen teargas shells and used batons besides making preventive detentions to restore order.\nAnother group came out from Batmaloo locality and were intercepted by the police, the officials said, adding that some of them managed to reach Jehangir Chowk but were detained by the police.\nThe officials said there was no report of any causality in the clashes.\nIttehadul Muslimeen (IM), a constituent of moderate faction of Hurriyat Conference, had vowed to take out the Muharram procession despite restrictions even as one of its delegations yesterday called on the state Governor N.N. Vohra, seeking his intervention in lifting the ban on the procession in the city on traditional routes.\nBesides Geelani, several other separatist leaders, including moderate Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Democratic Freedom Party president Shabir Ahmad Shah, were placed under house arrest on Wednesday to prevent them from visiting Batengoo to pay tributes to Bhat, who succumbed to injuries on October 18.\nJKLF chairman Mohammad Yasin Malik was also taken into preventive custody last evening and lodged at police station Kothibagh.\nRestrictions have been imposed in Anantnag town and Bijbehara police station area as a precautionary measure in view of clashes that took place yesterday and day before.\nTraffic on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway has been suspended due to the restrictions, while train services have been suspended for the day. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:26:56.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
