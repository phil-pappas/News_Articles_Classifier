Matt Harvey will start Game 1 at Kauffman Stadium and Jacob deGrom will follow him. \nWhen manager Terry Collins brought the starters into a room at Citi Field and laid out the order, he looked at Harvey and asked if he was ready for the task. \n\"Damn right,\" Harvey responded. \nHarvey was scheduled to start Game 5 of the National League Championship Series but there was no need after the Mets swept the Cubs. Collins didn't want to wait. \n\"I don't want to give him five more extra days if I could help it,\" Collins said. \nRELATED: 4 Kansas City Royals who pose biggest threat to Mets in World Series \nCollins slotted deGrom into Game 2 so he could get an extra day of rest. The manager saw deGrom showing signs of fatigue in his last two starts. DeGrom labored through six innings against the Dodgers in Game 5 of the National League Division Series against the Dodgers, then struggled to begin Game 3 against the Cubs before allowing just two runs in seven innings in the win. \nThat leaves Noah Syndergaard to start Game 3 when the series moves to Citi Field. Steven Matz starts Game 4. \nHarvey might pitch three times in the series -- starting games 1 and 5 and, if needed, he could come out of the bullpen in Game 7. He told Collins he would be ready.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:33:41.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
