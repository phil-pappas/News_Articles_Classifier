That includes his own circumstance from 2009, when an extortion case against a woman named Karen Cunagin Sypher led to the revelation Pitino had an affair with her and provided her with $3,000, either to have an abortion (her version) or obtain medical insurance (his version).\nAlthough it is dreadfully embarrassing to the university and its supporters to have a prostitute claim Andre McGee, a respected former player who was working on the basketball staff, paid her to arrange sex for some parents of prospects and some prospects, Pitino certainly is not going to be fired.\nIt would cost Louisville a fortune to rid itself of a coach who only two years ago delivered an NCAA championship. And he’s not going to quit because the next coach to willingly walk away from such a conflagration – that’s a fancy word for dumpster fire – will be the first. That would require someone whose entire career is built on a foundation of competitive drive to admit defeat and allow this episode to stand as the final statement of his four-decade career.\nWhich is not to say these next few years are going to be all fairways and greens.\nMORE: Indiana booster sparked investigation, UofL AD says\nAsk Roy Williams what it’s like to recruit against some of the nation’s marvelous basketball programs and an enduring investigation into NCAA-type issues.\nRecruits at this level are worried about three items: 1) Can I get to the NBA from here? 2) How fast can I get to the NBA from here? 3) While, I’m here, will I get to play in the NCAAs?\nIf a program is facing the prospect of postseason sanctions, it is bound to lose someone it wants, probably even someone it needs.\nIn a more competitive conference than ever, with the specter of Kentucky’s machine 75 miles down the road and with a roster already temporarily patched with graduate transfers Damion Lee and Trey Lewis, Louisville is going to need more players. The Cardinals have a four-man freshman class that was ranked No. 7 nationally, including top-20 guard Donovan Mitchell, but the players expected to lead the program in 2015-16 will be gone after spending one season in Louisville.\nPitino and his staff had been recruiting rather furiously, bringing in such high-end talents as Markelle Fultz and Tyus Battle on visits before they committed elsewhere. And then, with future McDonald’s All-American T.J. Leaf on campus this past weekend, there came the avalanche of horrific publicity announcing the release of “Breaking Cardinal Rules”.\nLeaf traveled all the way from the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, and was joined on the visit by his parents and grandparents, according to Scout.com website Cardinal Authority. The family met with athletic director Tom Jurich to discuss the burgeoning scandal, which no doubt was thrilling for all involved.\nMORE: Kentucky lands five-star Wenyen Gabriel\nLouisville has done well enough with the scouting ability of such staff members as Ralph Willard (who caught on to Russ Smith’s potential) and the relationships forged by the likes of former assistant Kevin Keatts (who helped land Montrezl Harrell), as well as Pitino’s prodigious teaching and strategic talent, to compile a 15-5 NCAA Tournament record in the seasons since the Sypher trial.\nBut the move to the ACC as of last season increased Louisville’s high-end competition in league play. And the need to spice the current roster with two senior transfers for the current season sounded an alarm. For this situation to develop so soon afterward compounds the challenge of maintaining a title-contending program.\n“To say I’m disheartened and disappointed would probably be the biggest understatement I’ve made since I’ve been a coach,” Pitino said at his press conference.\nThose emotions may last a while.\n© Timothy D.
