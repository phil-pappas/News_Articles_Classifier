Jasvir Singh was fatally shot inside his van on Saturday in California’s Oakland city, San Jose Mercury News reported. Residents of the locality said a gunman approached Singh, shot him inside his van and ran away through the backyards. The police have announced a reward of USD 10,000 for information leading to the arrest of the killer. Local residents described the horror of the broad day-light killing and expressed their fears of rising crimes on the streets of Oakland city. “I don’t understand why someone would murder our ice cream man,” said Paula, a nearby resident. “I heard five shots and came to my front door. I just feel really bad; he was doing his job, and now he’s gone,” she added. The police were told that Singh immigrated to the US 17 years ago, was unmarried and had a 13-year-old daughter. He was a resident of Marysville, but also lived in the East Bay area. So far this year, Oakland has recorded 74 homicides - 15 more than at the same point last year. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:04:41.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
