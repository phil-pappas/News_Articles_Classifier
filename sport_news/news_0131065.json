Huh) By ANDREW SELIGMAN The Associated Press CHICAGO â€” \nDaniel Murphy homered for a record-tying fifth straight game in the postseason, sending Jacob deGrom and the New York Mets over the Chicago Cubs 5-2 on Tuesday night for a 3-0 lead in the National League Championship Series. \nYoenis Cespedes and David Wright each had three hits for the Mets. Cespedes scored the go-ahead run on a two-out wild pitch by Trevor Cahill on a strikeout of Michael Conforto in the sixth inning. \nMurphy tied the homer streak mark set by Carlos Beltran in 2004. \nDeGrom pitched seven effective innings to improve to 3-0 in his first postseason. Jeurys Familia closed for his fifth save of the playoffs. \nThe Mets can advance to the World Series for the first time in 15 years with one more victory over Chicago in Game 4 of the best-of-seven matchup Wednesday night. Rookie Steven Matz gets the start for the Mets while Jason Hammel goes for the Cubs. \nKyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler homered for the Cubs, who have scored just five runs in the series.
