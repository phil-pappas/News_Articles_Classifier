DaJuan Summers also was released, leaving the Knicks at 14 players, one under the 15-man max.\nThe Post reported Antetokounmpo, the 6-foot-7 older brother of the Greek Freak, Giannis, received only a $75,000 guarantee, decreasing his chances of making the team. His agents have said the 23-year-old Antetokounmpo didn’t want to play in the D-League again and they have spoken to European teams. Antetokounmpo told The Post last week he still is hoping another NBA team would pick him up, but only the Bucks, his brother’s team, can be considered a viable option.\nAntetokounmpo played in three preseason games, recording four rebounds and two assists over 13 total minutes. He was drafted 51st overall, but never developed enough of an offensive game.\n \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under new york knicks ,  thanasis antetokounmpo ,  travis trice", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:12:43.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
