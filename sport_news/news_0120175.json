He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Las Vegas -- about 60 miles away. \nOdom, 35, won two NBA championships as a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers. \nHe married the younger sister of Kim Kardashian after a whirlwind romance in 2009. Khloe Kardashian filed for divorce four years later, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in July. \nKhloe Kardashian has been at the hospital by Odom's side since Tuesday night, according to source close to the reality star. She asked that people keep him in their thoughts and prayers and respect his privacy, the source said. \n'Everything was great' \nHof said Odom called him Saturday and told him he wanted to visit the brothel for a few days. Hof let him stay at his home, which is attached to the brothel. \n\"He was having a good time at the ranch and everything was great,\" Hof said, until Sunday, when Odom seemed \"a bit somber\" because people were \"calling and bothering him.\" \n\"Late Tuesday, two women at the brothel went to check on Odom and found him unconscious,\" Hof said. \n\"To my knowledge, there were no drugs involved. Lamar was eating well and was just healthy.\" \nBrothels are legal in Nevada in counties with fewer than 700,000 people, according to state law. \nReality star \nIn addition to appearing on \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" Odom and Kardashian had their own reality show, \"Khloe & Lamar.\" It lasted for two seasons and 20 episodes. \nDespite going separate ways, Kardashian has said she will always love him. \n\"I will never, ever not love Lamar,\" she told E!, which airs their reality shows. \"I was so obsessed with him in a healthy way. He was my husband, and I still wish he was.\" \nKardashian has expressed concerns for him, especially after his best friend died this year. \nDespite her family's objection, she regularly talked to her ex-husband by phone during episodes of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" this season. \nVeteran NBA player \nOdom played for four teams during his 14 seasons in the NBA and won the Sixth Man of the Year Award during the 2010-11 season. \nHe was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers in 1999, playing for the team for four seasons before signing with the Miami Heat. \n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with Lamar Odom and his family at this time,\" Miami tweeted. \nFellow NBA player Dwyane Wade said he was up late, worried about his friend and former Miami teammate. \n\"I can't help but to be up right now ... ,\" he tweeted early Wednesday. \"On my knees praying ... please God let him pull through.\" \nAfter one season in Miami, Odom was traded to the Lakers and was a key part of their championship teams in 2009 and 2010. \nA year later, he played briefly for the Dallas Mavericks before returning to the Clippers for one season. He has not played in the NBA since then. \nBut he has continued making headlines, including for a drunken driving charge two years ago. He pleaded no contest and received three years' probation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:20:40.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
