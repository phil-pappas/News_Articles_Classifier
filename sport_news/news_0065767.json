In a few days, she is going to turn 20. Beautiful, with a sunny smile that can melt the heart of the sternest teacher or conquer the severest critic, she continues to bring joy to our family. She is close to her elder brother — our biological child — with whom she shares the typical highs and lows of teenage life. People who do not know that she is adopted often comment on how she resembles her mother — me. I feel proud. Thus, it was with a sense of sadness that I read that the Missionaries of Charity are withdrawing from the process of adoption. If any one person’s name is associated with adoption in India, it is that of Mother Teresa. While there are some negative stories that circulate around the process of adoption and about the Missionaries of Charity, our own experience was very positive and nowhere during the process were we asked to pay anything other than the court and legal fees. Nor was religion ever an issue. Our voluntary work with Missionaries of Charity forged a close relationship with the nuns and enriched our understanding of various situations as well. Eventually, we set up Atmaja, an organisation that has been working as a support network for adoptive families for the last 15 years. Media reports suggest that there are two main reasons for the decision taken by the Missionaries of Charity. One is that the new guidelines issued by CARA — Central Adoption Resource Agency under the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development — give equal rights to single parents to adopt and the other is that now prospective parents will be given the particulars and photographs of six children from which to choose the child they want. The right of single mothers to adopt is not new. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act of 1956 categorically states that “Any male Hindu who is of sound mind and is not a minor has the capacity to take a son or a daughter in adoption, provided that, if he has a wife living, he shall not adopt except with the consent of his wife...” Similarly, “Any female Hindu (a) who is of sound mind, (b) is not a minor, and (c) who is not married, or if married, whose marriage has been dissolved or whose husband is dead or has completely renounced the world or has ceased to be a Hindu or has been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be of unsound mind, has the capacity to take a son or daughter in adoption”. These provisions go back to earlier Hindu customs which purport that the last funeral rites can only be performed by a son. The Act of 1956 carries the imprint of this belief in the injunction that a Hindu male cannot adopt a male child if he already has one son. Similarly, the single woman may adopt because the ‘natural’ maternal instincts should be fulfilled even if she is not married for some reason. Thus, while today we may view the right to adopt of single parents as a ‘modern’ phenomenon, it existed as part and parcel of traditional Hindu beliefs though based on completely different logic. However, the right to adopt was not given to Muslims, Christians, Jains or any other ‘non-Hindu’ groups. This exclusion was removed in the Juvenile Justice Act of 2000; now any Indian citizen can adopt under the provisions of this Act, including single men and women. Though the government claims the new guidelines are aimed at boosting the number of adoptions, the Missionaries of Charity have a policy of placing children with only a married mother and father. They have certain notions of what constitutes a good family for the adopted child and in their view the family plays a very big role. A single parent thus is a big no. The second cause of discomfort to the Missionaries of Charity stems from the kind of attitude that seems to be reflected in CARA’s new guidelines. At a meeting, the Minister in charge Maneka Gandhi reportedly took the adoption agencies to task, accusing them of “idleness, unconcern, deliberately lying” and threatened to cancel the licences of agencies which did not increase the abysmal rate of adoption. While it is true that many organisations are not only idle but also corrupt and ask for huge ‘donations’ from desperate parents, the methods listed in the guidelines seem to suggest technological and administrative solutions to what are actually deeper social problems. In a country where the number of fertility clinics is at least a hundred if not a thousand times more than adoption agencies, the desperation of couples for their ‘own child’ is very high. In a society where sex, skin colour, caste and religion play such key roles, the idea of taking into one’s family an abandoned child who is almost sure to be a female with a dark skin tone, abandoned by a lower-class, lower-caste or maybe even a Muslim mother, is just not acceptable. Most couples in India choose adoption reluctantly after undergoing fertility treatment. For them, adoption is always the second-best option and what ought to be a joyous process becomes a public admission of failure. Many who do adopt do not inform their friends, family or even their child. There are many stories of the child coming to learn that she was adopted after the death of her parents. Popular culture in India too celebrates the bond of blood over everything else. Thus, couples take the illegal route with the active connivance of maternity homes to recreate the illusion of a biological birth. People change houses, jobs, friends to hide the fact of adoption. The CARA website shows that the number of adoptions is abysmally low. In 2010, 5,693 children were adopted and the number went down to 3,988 in 2014-2015. Yet homes and orphanages are full of children. More than half of these figures are from West Bengal and Maharashtra. CARA must recognise and address the social dimensions as well as the procedural bottlenecks if the rate of legal adoptions is to rise. Part of the dynamics that all good adoption agencies try to assess is whether the child will get a home which is warm, caring and accepting. If the parents go in for adoption with a negative emotion, obviously the child will sense that and deep psychological fissures will result in unhappiness for all concerned. One aspect of this acceptance is the willingness to accept the child offered to them rather than looking at the photographs of six children and then choosing “the best”. In the case of biological parenthood, the law allows for no such choice and bans sex determination tests. What was the need to offer a selection of children to adoptive parents? The nuns of Missionaries of Charity have always maintained that even infants responded to ‘rejection’ by parents and were always distrustful of parents who wished to visit the nursery and choose ‘the best’ child. In many government policies, we see a reflection of the belief that technology can solve all our problems. Unfortunately, this is not true. CARA should focus on creating awareness about legal adoption. One of the problems in states like West Bengal is that the rules for declaring a child ‘free for adoption’ are so complicated and long-drawn-out that abandoned children fail to even enter the long chain of bureaucratic processing now required. Police and administrators are all too often clueless about how to proceed if a child is abandoned in their area. Neither do they have the funds. Nursing homes and hospitals should be monitored so that the sale of the unwanted girl children is eliminated. Often the maternity homes charge large sums to guarantee two things — the child would be from a ‘good family’ and the paperwork will leave no trace of ‘adoption’. On the one hand, there are thousands of couples going in for fertility treatment and surrogacy; on the other, thousands of children need a home. CARA needs to take a deeper look at the malaise in our culture and facilitate the work of those who have so successfully championed adoption for so many years.
