Hulse Gymnasium. \nThe Tigers went just 2 of 11 from the foul line in the fourth quarter, but the two they made came from junior Logan Henson, who knocked down a pair with just :09.1 left on the clock to send the lead to 69-65. \nTravis Lewis had brought the Panthers within 34-33 early in the third on a 3-pointer from the corner, but the Tigers answered with a 13-3 run to stretch their lead to double digits for the first time. \nValley Springs ended up outscoring Norfork 24-8 to end the third quarter after the Panthers had climbed to within one. The Tigers held a 58-41 advantage going into the final frame. \nGrant Casey knocked down a 3-pointer to bring the Panthers within 64-53 with 4:35 left, and Norfork kept inching closer. Jacob Standfield and Casey each scored to bring the hosts within 64-57 with 2:56 remaining. \nAfter Valley Springs missed a pair of free throws, Lewis — who led Norfork with 16 points — scored to bring the Panthers within five. Valley Springs guard Dalton Hogue was whistled for a charge and fouled out on the ensuing play, and Wyatt Chapman hit 1 of 2 foul shots for the Panthers to climb within 64-60. \nValley Springs freshman Dalton Audeoud knocked down a big trey — his second of the game — to make it 67-60 with 1:40 remaining, but Chapman hit a pair of free throws, and the Tigers missed two more foul shots. \nLewis hit 1 of 2 at the line with :27.8 left to play, and the Panthers scored on a tip-in with :13.3 left to draw within 67-65. Henson was fouled with :09.1 left and atoned for two missed charity tosses earlier in the quarter. \nJake Wynn led all scorers with 17 points for Valley Springs but did not score in the fourth quarter. Drew Saunders added 11 and Hogue notched 10 for the Tigers. \nCasey tallied 15 points, Jacob Standfield scored 14 and Chapman added 13 for the Panthers, who fall to 1-1 on the season. \nWith Norfork up 8-6 early, the Tigers scored 10 straight points to take a 16-8 advantage. Norfork rallied back within 16-14 after a 3-pointer by Casey, a bucket from Chapman and 1-of-2 free-throw shooting by Mason Rosson. The Panthers trailed just 18-14 at the end of one period. \nLewis buried a 3-pointer to being the second quarter, and after Valley Springs scored a basket, Creed Chapman hit a trey to knot the score at 20-20 with 5:55 left in the half. \nThe Tigers responded with a 9-1 run, receiving five from Wynn, and pushing to a 29-21 lead. Norfork crawled to within 31-26 by the end of the half. \nVALLEY SPRINGS (2-0) \nWynn 17, Saunders 11, Hogue 10, Garvin 8, Audeoud 8, King 6, Henson 4, Drewry 2. \nNORFORK (1-1) \nLewis 16, Casey 15, Standfield 14, W.
