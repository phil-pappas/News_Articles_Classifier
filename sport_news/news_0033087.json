South Africa had a man sin-binned and conceded only three, too. \nIn the last minute, it was the All Blacks who put up a wall as the South Africans tried to run out of their 22 and still could find no way through, their hopes of a third cup triumph washed away with a last knock-on. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:20:15.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
