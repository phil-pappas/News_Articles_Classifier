Nunez status for Saturday had been uncertain all week, but Sallee also tweeted Nunez could see time against the Tigers (4-0, 2-0 SEC) if he's healthy enough. \nOrth has completed 23-of-47 passes for 283 yards and a touchdown in 2015. He also has two interceptions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:32:52.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
