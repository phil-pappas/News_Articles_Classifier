But whatever it was, Olivia Czosek made the most of her opportunity Saturday.\nCzosek — a little-used sophomore — scored the only goal of the game in the final minute of play as the Dragons advanced to next week's AAA state soccer tournament with a dramatic 1-0 victory over host Arlington.\n\"I was so confident,\" Czosek said. \"I've been waiting for my time to come, waiting all season long and I'm just so happy.\"\nWith Collierville (14-4-1) creating chance after chance in the second half — but not scoring — coach Brittany Streger reached down deep in her bench to send Czosek on with about 15 minutes to go in the game with the words \"I'm taking a chance with you.\"\nAnd it paid off spectacularly as Czosek ran on to a nice cross from Elizabeth Slavinsky and buried it.\n\"In warm-ups, all my shots were going over (the goal),\" she said. \"So I told myself, 'You've got to get over this ball.'\"\nSaid Streger, \"We were struggling on the field so I said, 'Why not? Let's go get this done.' And she did it.\n\"It was beyond frustrating. We talked to them in practice about doing the things we needed to do, and if we had done them the whole time ...\"\nA lot of Collierville's frustration in front of goal was because of Arlington goalkeeper Ashton Shields, who made some terrific saves to keep it scoreless, including a great diving stop in the first half to deny Slavinksy and another in the second half to turn away Kate Johnson.\n\"We knew we had it at goalkeeper; we were hung over from the other night,\" said Tigers coach Zeke Vezina, referring to his team's overtime victory over Bartlett on Thursday in the Region 7-AAA championship.\n\"We just couldn't get the ball to our forwards. I'll admit we played a little conservatively. I knew it was because we had no legs.\"\nCzosek's winner was the highlight on a big Saturday for local soccer, as three other teams from Shelby County qualified for the state tournament.\nThe Dragons will be joined in the AAA tournament by Houston, which had no trouble with Bartlett in the other sectional, winning 6-0. The Mustangs (19-0-0) will be playing for their second title since 2003.\nBriarcrest (16-2-1) advanced to the Division 2-AA tournament, defeating Nashville Father Ryan 1-0. Ashton Pugh's second-half winner gave the Saints the victory.\nSt. Agnes was eliminated with a 1-0 loss to Nashville Ensworth.\nIn D2-A, ECS advanced with an impressive 4-0 victory on the road against Knoxville Webb. The Eagles — who finished third in the West Region — got goals from Lee Ellen Stanley, Graham Sippel, Ally Ellzey and Maddy Stolnicki.\nECS will be joined in Murfreesboro by St. George's, which defeated Franklin Road Academy 2-1 on Friday thanks to a pair of Sydney Brown goals.\nMemphis' other D2-A hopeful, St. Mary's, lost at Battle Ground Academy 3-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:41:49.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
