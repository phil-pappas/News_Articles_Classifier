(AP) - Zach Conque scored the game-tying touchdown with 38 seconds left, Mason Juhl converted the go-ahead extra point and Stephen F. Austin held on to beat Southeastern Louisiana 28-27 on Saturday night.\nThe game-winning, 16-play, 72-yard drive saw the Lumberjacks (3-3, 2-1 Southland) use exactly five minutes and convert five third downs, including Conque's TD run from a yard out.\nJohn Franklin sacked D'Shaie Landor with 14 seconds left as Southeastern Louisiana (2-5, 2-3) attempted to pull back in front. The Lumberjacks clinched the victory two plays later as the clock ran out while Landor's 12-yard pass failed to convert a fourth-and-13.\nHunter Taylor threw for 214 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. De'Quann Ruffin had six catches for 98 yards and two TDs, and Joshawa West ran for 82 yards.\nLandor finished 13 of 23 for 201 yards and two touchdowns for the Lions.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
