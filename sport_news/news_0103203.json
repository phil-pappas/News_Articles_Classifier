The six-play drive stalled and ended with a fourth-down incompletion at the ISU 39. The Bengals took a knee twice to run out the clock. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:55:15.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
