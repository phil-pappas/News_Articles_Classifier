Even though his players are banned from the postseason, and even though his program will lose nine scholarships over the next 36 months, Larry Brown is sorry.\nAdChoices At least that's what the journeyman head coach said in a statement released by SMU on Tuesday afternoon, in the wake of the NCAA's sanctions against the Mustangs program.\nMORE: Brown's career through the years | SMU's penalty is guilt by association\n\"Leading the SMU men’s basketball program is an honor and a responsibility that I take very seriously,” said Brown in the school's statement. “That duty includes helping our young men develop into people of character and to ensuring that we pursue our goals with integrity.\n\"I am saddened and disappointed that the Committee on Infractions believes that I did not fully fulfill my duties and I will consider my options to challenge that assertion in the coming days. I truly believe that our program has dedicated itself unwaveringly to the ideals of academic integrity and NCAA compliance. Still, there was a violation in our program and I take responsibility for that and offer my sincere apologies to the University community.”\nSMU has not yet decided whether it will appeal the NCAA's ruling, it said in the statement, while offering a condemnation of the governing body's postseason ban.\nMORE: NCAA says it didn't consider Brown's past in ruling\n\"While we accept responsibility for violations, the individuals responsible for the infractions have been held accountable both by the University and by the Committee on Infractions. To punish the student-athletes in the men’s basketball [program] by prohibiting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete in the postseason is simply wrong. It is not what our system of governance should be about and we are considering our response.”\nEven if SMU appeals the ruling, there is little chance that this year's crop of seniors — Markus Kennedy and Nic Moore — will get to play in any postseason tournament. Any potential appeal would span several months and would be unlikely to conclude before the players finish their senior seasons.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2015-09-29/smu-larry-brown-ncaa-violations-suspension-postseason-ban", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2015-09-29/ncaa-smu-postseason-ban-transfer-players-larry-brown", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656659-larry-brown-ncaa-violations-sanctions-scandal-kansas-smu-ucla", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2015-09-29/larry-brown-smu-infractions-ncaa-penalty-ucla-kansas-violations"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:50:58.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
