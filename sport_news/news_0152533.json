Burris left shortly after giving way to Danny O'Brien, but not before racking up 504 yards through the air on 53 attempts. \nAll this just after being named one of the three CFL Top Performers for September. \nLeading 23-3 at the half, Burris threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Brad Sinopoli and then ran one in himself from a yard out in the third quarter upping that lead to 37-3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:32:05.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
