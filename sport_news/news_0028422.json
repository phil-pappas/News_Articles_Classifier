We struggled between the 37th and 44th over but found our way at the end. \n\"To have (David) Miller up front was out of the box thinking from us. We were looking at 250 as a par, the way we fought back with the ball was special.\" \n\"(We) really worked hard this week on mixing it up a bit,\" added man of the match Morkel. \"I'm a rhythm bowler and need things to click to operate. We had a couple of game plans and it is important to execute and we did that. \n\"Every time I do well, especially against India, is very special. And it will last with me forever.\" \nDhoni, part of the India team which won the second ODI, said: \"I thought 270 was a par score, the wicket kept getting slower and slower and the dew didn't help us out. It became a bit two-paced and became difficult to play the big shot.\" \nTwo further ODIs remain, in Chennai and Mumbai, before, in November, the first of four Tests that will conclude South Africa's 72-day tour of the country.
