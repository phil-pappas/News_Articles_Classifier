Speaking at the launch of the IDFC Bank here today, the Prime Minister said the entire banking sector is undergoing major transformation with the advent of latest technology, and the future of banking would not just be premises-less and paper-less, but also, eventually, currency-less, and this would help curb black money. Modi further said India is slowly moving towards a situation where the currency printing cost will come down. “We have to take the country in that direction. As we use technology, we move to paper-less banking, currency-less business operations, the possibility of black money will gradually become negligible,” he said. He also stressed the need for banks to focus on the rural areas as they have immense potential. The Prime Minister also listed out the seven-point agenda to improve operations of the state-owned banks. It includes capitalisation, setting up of Bank Board Bureau and introduction of a framework for accountability.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:22:44.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
