It seems like Cisse's arrest has purely been precautionary and after co-operating with the investigation, he's \"expected to be ruled out of the case soon\".\nNever a dull moment in the life of Djibril.\n[via BBC Sport ]", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/eX5hbpOrIlj/embed/simple", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34513847", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:22:21.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
