She won the Nassaney Invitational at Smithfield, R.I., running the 5K course is 16:48, and followed that up with a first place finish at the University of New Hampshire Dual Meet in Durham, N.H. the following week. \nRocha led her team to a first place finish at the Coast To Coast Battle in Boston, coming from back in the pack to pass some of the leaders and take third in 16:53. A year ago, Rocha was 13th at that same race in 17:23. \nThe Friars, coached by veteran Ray Treacy, had been ranked eighth in the country prior to winning in the Hub. In doing so, they jumped all the way to third in the latest United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association rankings. \n“I was coming from the middle of the pack and wanted to stay close to the top five,” said Rocha, a three-season high school track star for the Tanners. “I was able to stay close enough to see what happened, and pushed harder in that last K when I was able to pass some people. The best thing was our team was first, which is great.” \nRocha has her sights set on the team’s big meets coming up. Some of the Friars will return to Boston today for the New England Championship at Franklin Park, but Rocha won’t race this weekend. \n“We have Wisconsin (the Adidas Invitational) coming up, which is a big meet, so I’m not running in Boston,” said Rocha. “I’ve run in Wisconsin the last two years so I’m familiar with the course. It’s a 6K, not the 5K we usually run, but as a team I think the longer distance is better for us. Of course, personally I like coming home to run at Franklin Park because I’ve been running there since high school.” \nBefore the season began, Rocha’s goal was to place in the top 40 at the NCAA championship and to have team place as well. Two years ago when she was a freshman, Providence won the NCAA championship. \nLast season, Rocha finished 33nd for All-America status after placing 62nd as a freshman. \n“It’s always more fun to go to nationals with all your teammates,” she said. “We’ve got a good team with about five of us close together. We push each other in practice and races, which is not only good for the team but for me personally. \n“The team goal is to return to the NCAAs and do better than last year when we were 13th. We think we can do it.” \n¢¢¢ \nThe top talent from all over the country came to Twi-Field in Danvers for the Golden Stick Wiffle Ball Nationals recently. The day-long event featured so many extra inning games that instead of being over around 10 p.m. it went until 1:30 the next morning. \n“The day was amazing,” said Lou Levesque, founder of GSWBL. “The teams were so even because of the player draft we had over 50 percent of the 31 games went to extra innings. It was supposed to be seven simple rounds ending around 9 p.m., but we didn’t start the final until around 11 p.m. \n“Many people came out to watch, and the support of Danvers Babe Ruth and (president) Keith Lucy was amazing. Babe Ruth handled the vending for us all day. The temperature dropped to 41 degrees, which made the evening games challenging but also more exciting. It was a true gauntlet for the two finalists; those guys started playing at 10 in the morning and didn’t finish until 15 hours later.” \nLevesque said it was the quintessential wiffle marathon like the days when the game was played in backyards — but this time, for a national championship. The 603 All Stars of New Hampshire capturing the title and cash prize. \n### \nJean DePlacido is a part-time writer and columnist for The Salem News.
