What makes Hurricane Patricia unique is its strength. \nAs of four o'clock Friday morning, Patricia's core pressure was at 880 millibars. A new east Pacific record, as the old record was 902, and it beat the western hemisphere record of 882, but it was just shy of the world record from Typhoon Tip in the west Pacific on October 12, 1979. \nAfter it makes landfall, computer models have it moving northeast into southern Texas by early next week. Whatever energy is left is expected to move toward the Great Lakes or the northeast United States. \nThis is at a time when cooler air will move into KELOLAND with highs only in the 40s on Wednesday. It will have to be watched as it could slow our warming trend going into next weekend, which means Halloween may end up a little cool. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
