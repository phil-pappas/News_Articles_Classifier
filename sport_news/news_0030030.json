The same committee also suspended Blatter, and general secretary Jerome Valcke, for 90 days.\nThe Blatter news may dominate the headlines but the Swiss leader was on his way out–albeit on his own terms, not those of an ethics committee he set up–early next year anyway.\nAll four men, as you might expect, have denied any wrongdoing. Valcke’s attorney issued a statement saying “it will be clear he did nothing wrong”. Blatter’s lawyer claimed the committee forgot to give him the right to a hearing and that it will be a different story once it hears his side of the story.\nPlatini issued a statement just before the suspension was announced, claiming it was “essentially an attempt to damage my reputation.” Mong-joon said FIFA was “profoundly irresponsible and unethical” in his sanctions, which he claims were for nothing more than “ethical attitude.”\nPlanet Futbol Video Sepp Blatter probe raises questions for him, Michel Platini, FIFA's future by Grant Wahl", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/benlyt"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:32:23.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
