Their father, Dan, has taught them the game and now he is their head coach in their first varsity season. \n\"They love the game of golf,\" said Dan Breslin. \"They are very athletic and they are disciplined. And there is just something special for a father to have the access of being a coach.\" \nThese two sisters are extremely competitive and that competition has helped both of them excel on the golf course, where they have enjoyed a lot of success this season with the Lady Panthers. \n\"My dad always tells me that if I didn't have Megan I wouldn't be half as good as I am,\" said Sarah Breslin. \"I am very lucky because we obviously make each other better.\" \n\"It pushes us to be the best that we can be,\" said Megan Breslin. \"Every day we practice and we always keep track and see it she beat me or I beat her.\" \nThe Breslin sisters play in the number one and two spots on the Lady Panthers team. The two of them played a big role in helping lead the Lady Panthers to a second place finish at the Mt. Carmel Regional. Sarah fired an 83, while Megan finished with an 87. \n\"It was huge especially since we got second,\" said Sarah Breslin. \n\"I am so excited to advance into sectionals and I hope that we are just as successful,\" said Megan. \nNow, the Breslin sisters will try and play their role in making history at Pinckneyville, as the Lady Panthers hope to advance on to state for the first time in program history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:53:48.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
