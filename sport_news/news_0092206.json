Rogers underwent surgery Monday and is not expected back for this week’s Sun Belt Conference matchup at Georgia Southern. Neither is the Aggies’ two-QB rotation.\n“I’ve never been a fan of the two-quarterback system,” Martin, a part-time quarterback during his playing days at Kentucky, said during Tuesday’s weekly media conference. “I didn’t like it as a player for obvious reasons and I don’t care for it as a coach. It’s a different position because it affects everyone else on the team. I want to give our team an identity at quarterback and say, ‘This is the guy.'”\nWho will be the Aggies’ guy come Saturday? Martin isn’t saying just yet.\nJeanty and Allen produced similarly modest numbers against Ole Miss and will be evaluated this week. Jeanty, a redshirt freshman, was 12-of-23 passing for 86 yards and rushed seven times for 31 yards. Allen, a sophomore, hit on 10 of 14 passes for 55 yards but was intercepted twice. He rushed six times for 4 net yards.\nAllen, who played quarterback in several games last season, had been working out at wide receiver until Rogers was sidelined with a broken thumb on his left (non-throwing) hand. Allen felt both he and Jeanty performed reasonably against a stout Ole Miss defense.\n“For my first game at quarterback I’d say I was decent,” Allen said. “I made two bad decisions I wish I could take back, but overall I thought Nick and I ran the ball pretty well and threw it exceptionally well.”\nMartin said Jeanty and Allen provide more of a running threat than does Rogers, but neither is as accomplished a passer as NMSU’s second-year starter. Still, Martin does not plan to drastically alter the offensive game plan against Georgia Southern (4-1, 2-0 SBC).\n“You can’t go in with a shortened playbook and try to be conservative,” Martin said. “You’re not going to shut Georgia Southern out, so we have to do what’s necessary to score points.”\nThe Eagles’ triple-option offense was shut out in its opener at West Virginia but has averaged 46.5 points per game since and leads the nation in rushing at 377.4 yards per game.\nRogers’ availability for future games remained uncertain Tuesday as he recovers from having a pin inserted in his left thumb. Martin said the surgery went well, but the Aggies (0-5, 0-1) do not have a timetable for Rogers’ possible return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:29:34.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
