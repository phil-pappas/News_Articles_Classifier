It was his eighth career title on the European Tour. \nEuropean Tour rookie Matt Fitzpatrick of England shot a final-round 69 to finish in a four-way tie for third with Lee Soo-min of South Korea (64), American Patrick Reed (67) and Australian Jason Scrivener (68) — all on 11 under and a massive seven shots behind Rose. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:21:15.215+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
