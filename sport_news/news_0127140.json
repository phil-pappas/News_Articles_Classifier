During this self-imposed exile, Kwarasey missed out on the qualifiers for both the 2015 and 2017 African Cup of Nations as well as the 2015 Cup of Nations where Ghana won silver. \nAfter several meeting and talks with Ghana coach Avram Grant and GFA president Kwesi Nyantakyi, Kwarasey is likely to change his stance. \n“Yes I will travel to Washington with the team next week.” \nOn his possible inclusion in the Stars set-up, Kwarasey was coy on his inclusion but confirmed they had been several talks to bring him into the Black Stars fold. \n“I think they’ve called me, at least there’s been dialogue and we’ve been talking and we’ll see what we will decide to do.” \nGhana plays Canada in a friendly at Washington with coach Avram Grant set to name his squad for the competition in the coming week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:14:07.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
