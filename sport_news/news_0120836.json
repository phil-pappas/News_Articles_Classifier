The Orlando Solar Bears scored three straight goals on two separate occasions Thursday night to earn a 6-3 victory over the Norfolk Admirals.\nThe Admirals scored first for the second consecutive night when Greg Chase knocked in a rebound at 2:02 of the first period.\nThat lead lasted just 1:08 before Chris Clapperton finished a rebound from between the circles.\nOrlando pushed the lead to 3-1 on goals by Erik Faille and T.J. Foster.\nThe three unanswered goals ended Norfolk goalie Philippe Cadorette's first pro start with 9:38 left in the opening period.\nThe Admirals (1-3-0-0) tied the score on Michael Pelech's putback late in the first period and\nGabriel Verpaelst's unassisted goal late in the second.\nBut Orlando made it 4-3 on Patrick Watling's shorthanded goal. The Solar Bears added two empty-netters in the final minute.\nThe teams play again Saturday night.\nPosted to : Admirals Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:46:23.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
