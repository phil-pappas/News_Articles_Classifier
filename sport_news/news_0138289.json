Blue Jays starter Marco Estrada was completely in command throughout the game, facing the minimum 15 batters through five innings, and staying into the game until the eighth.\nRoyals starter Edison Volquez couldn't match Estrada, giving up a solo homer in the bottom of the second as the Jays took an early 1-0 lead. It could have been worse were it not for an excellent catch by first basemen Eric Hosmer and a very good one by second baseman Ben Zobrist, both coming in the second inning.\nThe Royals collected their first hit in the fourth as Alcides Escobar led off the frame with a sharp single to left, though he was quickly erased as Zobrist hit into a 4-6-3 double play. Lorenzo Cain then popped out to second.\nThe Jays put a man on in the bottom of the fourth, but the Royals closed out any threat with a sharp 4-6-3 double play of their own.\nEstrada continued his dominance in the fifth with another one-two-three inning.\nVolquez also pitched well, just not quite as well. Aside from one bad pitch that Chris Colabello deposited in the left field bleachers, Volquez matched Estrada pitch for pitch through five innings.\nThe game unraveled for the Royals and Volquez in the bottom of the sixth.. Volquez walked the first batter then hit the second. With two on and nobody out slugger/evil villain Jose Bautista coaxed a walk on a controversial ball four call. With the bases loaded and still no one out, Volquez issued another controversial walk, which forced in a run making it 2-0 Jays. Manager Ned Yost went to the bullpen to bring in reliever Kelvin Herrera.\nAfter striking out the first batter, Herrera got lit up by Troy Tulowitzki who drove a double into the left-center field gap, clearing the bases and giving the Jays a 5-0 lead. \nThe Jays picked up another run in their half of the seventh and led 6-0 entering the eighth.\nIt was way too little way too late as Salvador Perez put the Royals on the board with a solo home run. A single after the homer finally knocked Estrada out of the game, but the Jays pen shut the door, and the Royals were down to their last three outs.\nThe Jays tacked on another run in the bottom on the eighth. The Royals went quietly in the ninth, and this series is heading back to Kansas City for game six Friday night with the Royals still needing a win to punch their ticket to the World Series.\nThe final is 7-1 Blue Jays.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
