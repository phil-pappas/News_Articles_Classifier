(Les Stukenberg/The Daily Courier) Doug Cook The Daily Courier The Division V No. 4-ranked Chino Valley High girls' soccer team has put to bed a tough late-season loss to three-time defending state champion and current No. 1 Blue Ridge Oct. 15, winning its second straight match in convincing fashion Monday, Oct. 19.Playing their 2015 regular-season home finale, the state playoff-bound Cougars dispatched Payson, 5-0, only 24 hours after routing section foe Grand Canyon, 10-0, on Senior Night Oct. 17.On Monday, Chino junior forward Katie Farnsworth scored a natural hat trick with three goals and added an assist, upping her stellar season total to 22 goals and 14 assists. Sophomore midfielder Felicity Stickrod and junior MF Cammy tenBerge added a goal apiece.Cougars freshman forward Lauren Foster, who has registered a whopping 21 goals and 17 assists this season, exited the match 15 minutes into the first half with an injured lower back, Cougars coach Allen Foster said. She's expected to be OK to play later this week.With the victory, Chino Valley improved its record to 14-5 overall, including 9-2 in the all-important power-point contests that help determine state playoff seeding.The Cougars will qualify for state for the second straight season after having not made it there since 2008.This fall, the Chino girls eclipsed the program's record for most wins, most goals scored and fewest goals against, coach Foster said.\"If we can get healthy, we'll be hard to stop,\" Foster added.The Cougars have one more important piece of business to tend to before focusing on the postseason, however. If they beat No. 5-ranked Northland Prep in D-V, Section II play to end the regular season on Thursday, Oct. 22, at Sinagua Middle School's artificial turf field in Flagstaff, the Cougars would win the section title.Northland Prep edged Chino, 2-1, in their season/section opener Sept. 1, at CVHS, but the Cougars subsequently shut out the defending state runner-up Spartans, 1-0, at the Old Pueblo Classic tournament Oct. 3 in Tucson.A victory by the Cougars in the rubber match on Thursday would require a tiebreaker - best power-point record - to determine which team captures the section crown. If Chino defeats Northland Prep, the former would have a 10-2 mark, while the Spartans would stand at 8-4-1.In the process, it's possible that the Cougars would move up to No. 3 in the D-V rankings and head into the eight-team state tournament as the 3-seed.If that happens, Chino would play host to a quarterfinal playoff match at 6 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 29, a perk for each of the state tourney's four top seeds. The Cougars would also avoid being on the same side of the bracket as Blue Ridge, an opponent Chino has lost to twice this season (3-1 Oct. 2; 4-1 Oct. 15).The state tournament continues with the semifinals at noon and 2 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 31, at Campo Verde High in Gilbert. D-V's championship match is scheduled for noon Saturday, Nov. 7, also at Campo Verde.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:17:43.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
