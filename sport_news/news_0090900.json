The performer admitted that every lyric on the album meant something to him personally.\n\"One of the songs, 'Josephine,' I actually wrote when I first met my wife, Vicky, and sang it to her over the phone, and I felt like there was this perfect song in there that I wanted to express and this is going on 12 years ago,\" Cornell said.\nThe 51-year-old, who is currently on tour, said he's found a happy balance between his solo efforts and writing music for Soundgarden, though the band isn't rushing to release new material.\n\"Since 2010, when we started working again as a band, the only rule we had was we don't have a calendar,\" Cornell said. \"It takes exactly the same amount of time it always did, we are just not blowing deadlines anymore because we don't have any (deadlines). We might even work a little bit faster.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:24:26.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
