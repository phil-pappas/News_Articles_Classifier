Doctor’s, nurses and other health professionals incorporate Reach Out and Read’s evidence-based model into regular pediatric check-ups by advising parents about the importance of reading aloud and giving developmentally appropriate books to children. \n“We became involved in the program because our physicians have always believed reading to children helps develop their dialog and promotes good communication between the child and parent,” says Angi Ellsworth, BCFM Clinic Manager. “Partnering with the Ericson Public Library and the Reach Out and Read Program has followed the activities our providers have promoted all along. Thanks to donations from the Boone Lion’s Club, we are able to provide each child beginning at age of 6 months up to 6 years a new book at their well child visit.” \nThe Reach Out and Read Program fits with the Ericson Public Library’s goals of building early literacy and forming community partnerships. Thanks to the generous donation from the Boone Lion Clubs, approximately 500 hundred books have been purchased which should last the clinic about one year. Dr. Scott Thiel with Avery Anderson, Dr. Joshua and Myra Anderson’s daughter, look through the new books", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:16:02.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
