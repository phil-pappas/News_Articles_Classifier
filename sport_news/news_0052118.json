Students and teachers were told to stay inside until the lockdown was lifted Friday afternoon after the two men were detained, but police said no arrests have been made.\nThe incident marked the third shooting on or near the campus in less than a week, though it's unclear whether the shootings were related. Friday's shootings also came the same day as a fatal shooting at Northern Arizona University, and about a week after eight students and a teacher were fatally shot at a community college in Oregon.\n\"Like President Obama says, this is getting to be too regular,\" Texas Southern President John Rudley said during a Friday afternoon news conference.\nRudley said the Texas Southern student who was killed was a freshman, though his name and age haven't been released. The second victim, whose name also hasn't been released, was shot twice and is hospitalized in stable condition, Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva said.\nRudley urged the school's roughly 9,700 students to be more vigilant, noting that \"we're in the inner city. Crime is all around us.\" He also criticized what he said was a culture among some students who believe they shouldn't snitch on each other.\nSilva said police were still searching for a third man and were trying to determine a motive in the shooting.\nShe wouldn't say whether police believed the suspected shooter was in custody. She noted that police aren't treating the case as an \"active shooter\" investigation, in part because witnesses said the shooter wasn't moving from place to place and fled the scene after the shooting.\nThe fatal shooting came just hours after another shooting near the same student-housing complex injured one person; in response to the pre-dawn shooting, the university said it would increase police on campus. On Tuesday, university police said a shooting after a poetry slam on campus injured another man.\n\"My main concern is what they're going to do now,\" Daijsa Fowls, a 19-year-old pharmacy student from Houston, said as she stood outside the housing complex's gate Friday afternoon. \"I'm supposed to be moving on campus and it shakes me up.\"\nFowls noted that she had a 3-year-old son, and said she wouldn't feel safe walking with him on campus. She said she planned to move into one of the nearby housing units but is now considering transferring to another school.\n\"A bullet has no name,\" she said. \"It could hit anybody.\"\nBrittney Solomon, a 19-year-old psychology student from Houston, said she also planned to move to campus.\n\"I'm most definitely concerned,\" she said. \"It's really nerve-racking feeling that a person here could have a gun.\"\nClasses were canceled following the lockdown Friday. Rudley said classes will resume Monday.\nDavid Warren reported from Dallas.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
