For the second week in a row,   football team won the pregame coin toss and took the ball instead of deferring to the second half. Less than two minutes later it was in the end zone to kickstart the Wildcats’ 37-14 win Saturday over Elon before a homecoming crowd of 16,713 at Cowell Stadium. They rode another fast start to victory. Dalton Crossan rushed for four touchdowns and Adam Riese threw for another in his second career star as UNH built a 34-7 halftime lead. The No. 20/23 Wildcats have outscored their last two opponents in the first half, 80-14. With their second straight win, they improved to 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the Colonial Athletic Association. “I thought it was a good victory,” said UNH coach Sean McDonnell. “Very pleased with the way we got out of the gate and the way we played in the first half.” The win also gives them momentum going into the bye week with a chance for some of the walking wounded to get healthy, most notably quarterback Sean Goldrich and safety Daniel Rowe. Crossan gained 93 yards on 12 carries in the first half Saturday, and scored on runs of 36, 1, 8 and 2 yards. He also returned a kick for another 39 yards. The junior, who missed much of last season with nagging hamstring injury, finished with a career-high 140 yards on 22 carries. It was also the Wildcats’ first 100-yard rushing game this season. “I’ve seen it for four years here,” McDonnell said. “Unfortunately last year he was nicked up along the way. When he’s playing, he’s a productive kid. He’s a good football player. The thing I like about today is he ran downhill.” His 36-yard scamper on the Wildcats’ fifth play from scrimmage put UNH ahead to stay, 7-0. The Wildcats other TD in the first half came on a 4-yard pass from Riese to tight end Jordan Powell. UNH led, 20-0, after one quarter and 27-0 less than 17 minutes into the game. Defensively, the Wildcats held the Phoenix to 8 total yards in the first quarter and minus-2 yards passing. Elon (2-3, 1-1) managed only five total yards on its first five possessions. The defense set up one score on an interception by Lamar Edmonds and another on a blocked punt by Jared Kuehl. Riese’s TD pass to Powell made it 14-0 midway through the first quarter. The Wildcats twice converted on fourth down to keep the drive alive. “It’s great for us,” linebacker Akil Anderson said of the fast start on offense. “It gives us a lot of momentum. We feel like we have the upper hand when we go out there. We feed off that.” The Wildcats went up 20-0 on Crossan’s 1-yard plunge early in the second quarter, capping a 53-yard drive after Edmonds’ pick gave UNH a first down on its 47. It was the first of five interceptions for the Wildcats, who didn’t have any in the first four games. “We did a good job up front getting pressure on the quarterback,” Anderson said, “and when he threw it guys just made plays on the ball.” Kuehl blocked a punt on Elon’s next possession. The Wildcats took over on the 8 and Crossan scored on first down, giving UNH a 27-0 lead with 13:37 left in the first half. Crossan’s 2-yard run with 4:49 to go in the second quarter made it 34-0. “It was nice,” he said of his career day. “It’s not me. It’s a team effort.” The Phoenix got on the board on a 7-yard pass from Daniel Thompson to Tereak McCray with 42 seconds to go in the first half. Elon made it 34-14 on its first possession of the second half on a 2-yard run by B.J. Bennett. “I always felt we had control of the game,” McDonnell said. “I thought we executed in all three phases.” UNH went up, 37-14, on a 26-yard field goal by Christian Breda with 1:20 remaining in the third quarter. With the Phoenix threatening to make it a two-possession game early in the fourth quarter, cornerback Casey DeAndrade came up with an interception in the end zone. “We needed this win,” McDonnell said, “and we got it.” By Al Pike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:59:06.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
