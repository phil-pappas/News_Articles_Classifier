Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images \nI reland stunned world champions Germany 1-0 thanks to Shane Long's 70th-minute strike on Thursday to throw Euro 2016 qualifying Group D wide open and maintain their chances of booking a spot at the finals with a game left to play. \nLong latched on to a deep cross from substitute goalkeeper Darren Randolph to drill past Germany stopper Manuel Neuer and take Ireland, who visit Poland on Sunday, level on 18 points with their next opponents. \n\"The whole team did magnificently. It was a wonder goal,\" Ireland coach Martin O'Neill told reporters after their first victory in a competitive game against the Germans. \n\"It's a historic win, a great win and the players deserve it.\" \n\"Just a splendid effort by the team. We've still got a big struggle in a few days time,\" he said. \nGroup leaders Germany, who have 19 points and only needed a draw to qualify in Dublin, next host Georgia. \n\"It was an unexpected and completely unnecessary defeat,\" said Germany coach Joachim Loew. \"I cannot accuse the team of not fighting but you have to stay cool and score those goals. \n\"We dominated throughout but made nothing out of that dominance.\" \nThe Germans had suffered a late blow in the build-up to the match with captain Bastian Schweinsteiger ruled out before the kickoff having picked up a groin injury in their final training session. \n\"What happened is what happens with teams like Ireland and that is that we had a lot of possession,\" Germany defender Mats Hummels said. \n\"We had our chances but they used their only one. Ireland made the most out of very little. Now we know it can get very tight in the last game and we have to be dominant against Georgia and not let anything happen.\" \nBut they still had no problem taking control of the game with some swift passing and lots of movement off the ball and wasted a couple of early chances, with the unmarked Jerome Boateng missing the target with a header and Ilkay Guendogan seeing his effort deflected wide. \nThe visitors gradually eased off, however, allowing Ireland more space and as the hosts grew in confidence they were almost caught on the break when Andre Schuerrle, a replacement for the injured Mario Goetze in the first half, fired over the bar. \nIreland continued to work hard and were rewarded when Randolph's long kick sent Long clear to beat Neuer with a powerful shot after he raced past two Germany defenders. \nGermany striker Thomas Mueller should have levelled with a close-range effort seven minutes later but the hosts held on for a memorable win. \nNorthern Ireland and Portugal seal Euro 2016 spots Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill is thrown in to the air by his players as they celebrate clinching qualification for Euro 2016. Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images \nN orthern Ireland qualified for their first major finals since the 1986 World Cup and Ireland beat world champions Germany in Dublin on a great night for Irish soccer on Thursday. \nThere was also joy in Portugal as the Euro 2004 hosts booked their place at Euro 2016 in France. \nThe biggest cheers in Europe came out of a half-renovated WindsorPark in Belfast after Northern Ireland beat 2004 European champions Greece 3-1 to reach the European Championship for the first time. \nTwo goals from skipper Steven Davis and one from John Magennis sealed the victory and left coach Michael O'Neill's men unbeaten after nine matches at the top of Group F. Their final game is against Finland in Helsinki on Sunday. \n\"It's an amazing feeling, how the players played was just outstanding,\" O'Neill told reporters. \n\"It's a privilege to be here as their manager, proud to stand here as their manager.\" \nDavis described it as an unbelievable evening. \n\"A magnificent night and we couldn't have asked for it to go any better. Listen to that (crowd), unbelievable,\" he said. Portugal's Joao Moutinho, right, celebrates his goal against Denmark.

Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images \nP oland stayed on course to reach Euro 2016 after Robert Lewandowski scored in stoppage time to grab a last-gasp 2-2 draw against Scotland, whose hopes of qualifying ended on Thursday. \nPoland stayed second in Group D with 18 points and know that victory at home to Ireland, who also have 18 points, in their final match on Sunday will book their spot in the tournament. \nScotland, who had led until the dying seconds of the game at Hampden Park, a result that would have kept alive their qualification hopes, are now out of the race with 12 points from nine matches. \nLewandowski continued his prolific form when he opened the scoring in the third minute, sliding the ball beneath Scotland keeper David Marshall. \nThe hosts drew level with a rasping left-footed shot from Matt Ritchie beyond the reach of Poland keeper Lukasz Fabianski on the stroke of halftime. \nBetter was to come for the Scots when Steven Fletcher curled home a superb effort in the second half, whipping the home crowd into a frenzy. \nAlbania, who lost 2-0 at home to two late goals in a politically-charged match against Serbia in the same group, could have qualified for their first ever finals with a win. \nBut because Denmark have now finished their programme, and are only a point ahead, Albania can still claim the automatic qualifying spot if they win in Armenia on Sunday. \nArmenia, who only have two points, lost 4-0 to France in a friendly in Nice. \nHungary remained in contention to finish in the top three in Group F with a 2-1 win over the Faroe Islands thanks to two late goals from substitute Daniel Bode, as do Romania, who drew 1-1 with Finland who are out. \nWith one match to play Northern Ireland have 20 points, Romania 17 and Hungary 16. \nThe top two teams in each of the nine groups qualify automatically along with the best-placed third team and four playoff winners from the remaining third-placed teams. \nHosts France, Austria, the CzechRepublic, England and Iceland have already qualified.
