(AJ Mast / AP) DOUG FEINBERG Associated Press Maya Moore puts the Lynx on the brink of a WNBA championship \nINDIANAPOLIS â€” Former UConn All-American Maya Moore made a three-pointer at the buzzer from the top of the key to give the Minnesota Lynx an 80-77 victory over the Indiana Fever on Friday night in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals. \nMoore, who scored 24 points, took the inbounds pass with 1.7 seconds left, moved to her right to elude a defender and swished the winner. The referees reviewed the play before declaring the basket good. \nMinnesota leads the best-of-five series, 2-1. Game 4 is Sunday with Minnesota trying to win its third title in five years. The team that has won Game 3 has won 70 percent of the titles since the WNBA went to a best-of-five format in 2005. Indiana is trying to become the first No. 3 seed to win a title. The first 18 championships were won by one or two seeds. \nThese teams played in the Finals in 2012, which Indiana won for its lone title. After splitting the first two games that season, Indiana routed Minnesota in Game 3. This one was much tighter. \nNeither team led by more than five points in the fourth quarter Friday. Minnesota trailed 77-74 with 2:08 left before former Husky Renee Montgomery hit a three-pointer to tie it at 77 with 1:11 left. \nBoth teams missed shots over the next 40 seconds before Indiana had the ball with 25 seconds left. Shenise Johnson's jumper from the corner was partially tipped with a few seconds left, and the ball went out of bounds, giving Minnesota a chance to win in regulation. \nMoore, who had played only 12 minutes through the first three quarters because of foul trouble, scored 12 points in the final quarter to lift the Lynx. Seimone Augustus finished with 13 points, and Montgomery had 12. \nJohnson scored 17 to lead Indiana. Tamika Catchings had 10 points and 10 rebounds. \nMoore helped Minnesota build a 28-21 early in the second quarter and was playing well before she picked up her third foul and sat the rest of the half. \nWith Minnesota's star on the bench, Indiana got going on offense. Catchings started a 14-6 run with her first basket of the game. Johnson had nine points in that spurt, including a three-pointer that gave the Fever a 37-34 lead. \nThat shot capped a 9-0 burst and brought the 16,332 fans, including Paul George and many other Indiana Pacers, to their feet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:29:06.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
