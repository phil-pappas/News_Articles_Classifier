They are Venezuelan federation president Rafael Esquivel, ousted FIFA vice president Eugenio Figueredo and former Costa Rican federation president Eduardo Li. \nThe court also found that the unnamed man was \"more than capable of traveling,\" has no close ties to Switzerland and electronic monitoring would not reduce his flight risk. Further medical tests are being carried out. \nThe trio is among six officials still in custody in Switzerland after being indicted in the FIFA bribery case launched by the U.S. Justice Department. \nThe U.S. blocked Nicaragua's attempt to extradite FIFA development staffer Julio Rocha. Costas Takkas, a British aide to former FIFA vice president Jeffrey Webb, and Jose Maria Marin of Brazil remain in custody. \nWebb is the only one of the seven arrested in Zurich to now be in the U.S. \nSepp Blatter is still in power at FIFA after rejecting demands on Friday from four sponsors to quit immediately instead of remaining president until the emergency election in February. \nWhen contacted by The Associated Press on Monday, both Coca-Cola and Budweiser maker Anheuser-Busch InBev declined to say what their response would be to Blatter snubbing their request. McDonald's and Visa have not responded to questions. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:31:31.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
