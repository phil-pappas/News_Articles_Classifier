(Courtesy of MANICA Architecture) (steelblue) The Warriors announced Monday they have formally acquired the 12-acre site of their future arena in San Francisco from Salesforce.com . \nThe price of the private land was about $150 million, Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times last month. The Warriors last April had purchased an option on the property in the Mission Bay neighborhood bounded by 3rd, 16th and South Streets and Terry Francois Blvd. \nThe closing came days after the Warriors along with UCSF and San Francisco mayor Ed Lee announced that UCSF would officially endorse the arena project after reaching preliminary agreements to address traffic concerns for the neighboring hospital. \n\"We've been the Bay Area's team for more than 50 years, and this plan keeps us in the Bay Area for the next 50 and beyond,\" Warriors president Rick Welts said in a statement. \"If there were any lingering doubts about our commitment to Mission Bay, purchasing this land should put them to rest. We love this neighborhood -- nobody else is getting this land.\" \nSome UCSF scientists who oppose the arena had written in a letter to Lee last month, \"Our major fear is that the Mission Bay site will lose its appeal -- not only for the new biomedical enterprises that the city would like to attract here, but also for most of its current occupants.\" Advertisement \nThe Warriors plan to open the privately financed arena in time for the 2018-19 season. The entire project is expected to cost the Warriors more than $1 billion, as offices, public plazas, restaurants will also be built on the site.
