Allentown Central Catholic played at Freedom High School in varsity football in Bethlehem on Friday, October 2, 2015. BETHLEHEM DONNA FISHER/THE MORNING CALL Pic made FRIDAY, OCT.2, 2015 (DONNA FISHER / THE MORNING CALL) Stephen Miller and Keith Groller Contact Reporters Of The Morning Call How do the teams line up for Week 7 in EPC football? A look at all 9 matchups. \nCentral Catholic at Emmaus \nWhen: 7 tonight \nIn the spotlight: Two offenses that operate at different paces will try to control the tempo. Will Central Catholic succeed in speeding up the game and using its athletes to wear down the Green Hornets? Will Emmaus' power rushing attack keep the ball away from the Vikings? The answer to those questions will determine who nabs a rivalry win. \nBy the numbers: Emmaus senior running back Kyle Boney has scored 19 of his team's 25 offensive touchdowns (18 rushing, one receiving). … Dallas Kassis leads Central Catholic with four interceptions. \nEast Stroudsburg North at Nazareth \nWhen: 7 tonight \nIn the spotlight: Nazareth avoided poor starts during a 4-1 start but produced a clunker last week, spotting Central Catholic a 28-point lead in a mistake-filled first quarter. The Blue Eagles need a better opening against the Timberwolves, who will seek long scoring drives with their option attack. If Nazareth jumps on East Stroudsburg North early, it will enhance its chances of returning to the win column. \nBy the numbers: Nazareth's defense has averaged one interception per every 12 pass attempts by its opponents. … The Timberwolves held a 6-0 lead over Bethlehem Catholic until the final minute of the first half last week. North attempted just two passes against Becahi, one of which was intercepted. …The Timberwolves are No. 2 in defense in the EPC North, allowing 301.2 ypg. \nLiberty at Northampton \nWhen: 7 tonight \nIn the spotlight: Can Liberty avoid looking past the Konkrete Kids? Northampton has struggled to score this season and may not be able to keep pace with the Hurricanes if they play at their typical level. Look for Liberty to try to put this game away early, setting it up for a challenging final stretch against Easton, Central Catholic and Freedom. \nBy the numbers: Liberty junior running back Gunner Anglovich has scored at least one touchdown in five straight games. … Northampton has turned the ball over only six times in its six games. \nParkland at Easton \nWhen: 7 tonight \nIn the spotlight: Parkland's defensive front could not slow Liberty's rushing attack last week, leading to its first loss this season. The Trojans need a better showing against Easton, which has done the majority of its damage on the ground. The Trojans have a size edge along their defensive front but must make sure not to allow Easton's smaller, quicker players to win in the trenches with their technique. \nBy the numbers: Senior flanker Trevon Mills has caught 10 of the 31 passes Easton has completed this season. … Parkland has four receivers with at least 15 catches, led by senior Kenny Yeboah (24 receptions, 310 yards). \nWhitehall at Freedom \nWhen: 7 tonight \nIn the spotlight: Whitehall's offense had little success moving the ball last week against Easton. The Zephyrs now must contend with Freedom, which has allowed the second-fewest points in the division. Whitehall's young offensive line has to give quarterback Gianni Sinatore time to operate, or it could be another long week. \nBy the numbers: Junior linebacker Devin Martinez leads Whitehall with seven tackles for loss. … Freedom has allowed an average of 142.8 yards of offense to its last four opponents. \nStroudsburg at Allen \nWhen: 7 tonight \nIn the spotlight: The Mounties will go for their sixth straight win and try to keep the momentum going entering their showdown with Becahi on Oct. 23. Jamaal Brome had another big night against Pocono East, rushing for 159 yards and three touchdowns. Marcello Riccardi continues to be a playmaker on both sides of the ball for the Mounties. He caught five passes for 108 yards and a touchdown and also ran an interception back 57 yards for another score. \nBy the numbers: Allen had a season-high 181 yards rushing against Pocono Mountain West, led by sophomore Muaz Chaudry's 93 yards on five carries and a TD. However, the Canaries were clipped by four turnovers and 11 penalties. … Allen's offense is tilted toward the run. The Canaries have 800 yards on the ground, but just 206 passing. … Brome leads the EPC North in rushing with 1,145 yards and 9.2 yards per carry. \nDieruff at Pleasant Valley \nWhen: 7 tonight \nIn the spotlight: Two teams streaking in different directions. The Huskies have dropped four straight and the Bears have won three in a row to get back in postseason contention. While Dieruff is coming off consecutive shutout losses, the Bears broke loose for 335 yards on the ground against South led by Austyn Borre's 129 yards and two TDs. PV surrendered more than 440 yards to East Stroudsburg South, but still won by 30. \nBy the numbers: PV kicker Dean Krcic booted three field goals in last week's win. … The Huskies trailed unbeaten and state-ranked Freedom only 10-0 at halftime but gave up 29 unanswered points after the break. … Devonte Robinson paced Dieruff with 59 yards on 16 carries while Badih Haddad had nine tackles vs. Freedom. …With 104 attempts, Robinson is third in the EPC North in total carries, behind only Brome and E.S. North quarterback Tom Melchiorre. \nE.S. South at P.M. West \nWhen: 7 tonight \nIn the spotlight: A talented junior quarterback in Cavs' junior Jake Cirillo, who accounted for 375 yards in total offense last week in loss to Pleasant Valley. He'll operate against a Panthers defense that has struggled most of the season. West beat Allen for its first win of the season, getting a big night from quarterback Dylan Della Valle who passed for 188 yards and a pair of touchdowns. \nBy the numbers: The Cavs have allowed an average of 53.6 points in their five losses and are worst against the rush in the EPC North, allowing 281.5 yards per game. … The Panthers scored 41 points for the second straight season against Allen. … West is last in the EPC North in defense, surrendering 383.3 yards per game. \nP.M. East at Becahi \nWhen: 1:30 p.m., Saturday \nIn the spotlight: The Golden Hawks will try to get the offense clicking again on all cylinders after being held to a season-low point total by East Stroudsburg North in a 28-6 win last week. The Cardinals are coming off a rough outing against Stroudsburg when they fell behind 28-0 in the second quarter and were limited to six first downs by the Mounties defense. \nBy the numbers: Matt Fisher accounted for 85 of East's 113 total yards last week against Stroudsburg. … Becahi is averaging 323 yards rushing per game, 8.4 yards per carry. … The Golden Hawks are no longer the top scoring team in District 11, dropping to third — two points behind Easton (266) and one behind Saucon Valley (265). … The Golden Hawks are No. 1 in the EPC North in both offense and defense by a wide margin. They average 473.3 ypg on offense and give up just 235.7 ypg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:00:19.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
