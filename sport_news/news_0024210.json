(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) By DAVE SKRETTA The Associated Press KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” \nThe latest on the American League Championship Series between the Blue Jays and Royals, which began Friday night in Kansas City (all times local): \n4 p.m. \nRoyals manager Ned Yost wishes he had listened a bit more to John Gibbons when his Toronto counterpart was on his staff a few years ago. \nMaybe he'd have learned something to help the Royals in the ALCS. \nAfter Gibbons was fired by the Blue Jays in 2008 in his first go-around as their manager, he was hired that October by then-Royals manager Trey Hillman as a bench coach. Gibbons stuck around when Hillman was fired in May 2010, working for Yost through the 2011 season. \nAsked about those years together, Yost acknowledged before Game 1 on Friday: \"I didn't take full advantage of Gibby when he was here. At the time I was still a little on the hard-headed side and managed the game all by myself.\" \nGibbons said he harbors no ill will over their time together.
