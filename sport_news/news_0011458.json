Photo by Mark Cornelison HERALD-LEADER | Buy Photo \nHenry Clay defensive back Davonte Robinson announced Sunday that he is closing his recruitment and is fully committed to the University of Kentucky. \nRobinson  a 6-foot-2, 180-pound cornerback  originally committed to UK last October and was one of the first members of the Wildcats recruiting class of 2016. He later received heavy interest from Ohio State, Notre Dame, Alabama and several other major schools. \nNotre Dame was scheduled to host Robinson for an official visit Saturday night for its home game against Southern Cal, but Robinson cancelled that trip earlier in the week. He told the Herald-Leader on Thursday that he wasnt sure if he would re-schedule the visit, and he ended up attending UKs home game against Auburn later that night. \nOn Sunday afternoon, Robinson officially ended his recruitment. \nI have officially decided to close recruiting, Robinson said. I thank all the coaches who have offered me but Im fully committed to Kentucky and Im ready to put on the blue and white. \nRobinson is considered a three-star prospect by the major recruiting services, though his size, track-star speed and natural football instincts make him one of UKs most-coveted commitments for 2016. \nHe will be able to officially sign with the Wildcats in February.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:30:44.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
