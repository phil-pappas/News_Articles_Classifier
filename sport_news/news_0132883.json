(WKRC) -- Kentucky men's basketball junior forward Derek Willis will miss the next two weeks after suffering a finger injury on his left hand in Saturday’s practice. Willis is expected to return in time for UK’s Blue-White Scrimmage on Oct. 27. \"I’m happy that it’s not something that will keep Derek out very long, but I’m disappointed because I really wanted him to participate in tomorrow’s open practice,” head coach John Calipari said. “It’s nothing serious and he will be back in a couple weeks, but I’m disappointed for him because he had been doing so well. He deserved to show his stuff tomorrow. He’s made great strides and will bounce back from this.” Willis has appeared in 33 games in his career, including 19 in 2014-15, his sophomore season. The Mt. Washington, Ky., native scored in seven of his first eight appearances and logged time in three of UK’s five NCAA Tournament games in 2015. Willis, a 6-foot-9 forward, is expected to add key depth this season to a front line that lost Karl-Anthony Towns, Willie Cauley-Stein, Trey Lyles and Dakari Johnson to the NBA Draft. UK lost junior guard Dominique Hawkins earlier in the week with a broken right hand. He underwent successful surgery Tuesday and is expected back in approximately four weeks.
