Woods had his first surgery just before the 2014 Masters and missed nearly three months. He said later he came back too early.\n\"Rehab will be soon, and it will be tedious and long,\" Woods said at the Bridgestone America’s Golf Cup, an exhibition he was supposed to play with Matt Kuchar until the second surgery. \"The last one, it took me awhile to get back. Some players on tour have done the same procedure and to be back pain-free it took them over a year.\"\nFor most of his career, the record with which he was compared was Jack Nicklaus and his 18 professional majors. Woods has 14 majors but turns 40 in December. Nicklaus won only three of his 18 majors after he turned 40.\n\"It’s important for me to have more than 18 majors when all is said and done,\" Woods said. \"It took Jack his whole career to achieve it and mine is not done yet.\"\nThere was no timetable on when he would start rehabilitation or when he would return. What might help this time around is that Woods said he won’t be changing his swing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:34.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
