James didn’t speak to the media following the Cavs’ workout at Cleveland Clinic Courts. \nBlatt says James is “fine” heading into the season opener on Tuesday in Chicago. The four-time MVP only played in two of Cleveland’s seven exhibition games, missing the last three after receiving a shot. \nBlatt says James will be out there “very soon.” \nPower forward Tristan Thompson hasn’t yet rejoined the team after agreeing to a five-year, $82 million contract on Wednesday. The team hopes to have Thompson on the floor on Friday. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:21:58.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
