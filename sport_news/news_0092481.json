Beavers will be hard pressed to win a Pac-12 game \nA 6-foot-2, 237-pound bruiser from Sandy, Nall had more rushing attempts against Colorado than in the previous six games combined. Senior Storm Barrs-Woods may be the sixth-leading rusher in school history, but Nall has likely arrived as the lead back. \nAndersen called Nall a \"war daddy,\" and he represents the type of player Andersen is looking for on the recruiting trail as he attempts to rebuild the youngest team in the Pac-12 into a contender. \n\"He's everything that a great football player stands for in my mind and he's a freshman, and that excites the hell out of me,\" Andersen said. \nBut there's nothing exciting about losing to Colorado (4-4, 1-3), which ended its 14-game Pac-12 losing streak at OSU'sexpense. \nThe Beavers squandered their best opportunity to avoid going winless in conference play for the first time since 1997. The Beavers are almost certain to be double-digit underdogs in their remaining games against Utah, UCLA, California, Washington and Oregon. \nMoving forward Andersen said OSU will utilize a two-quarterback system of true freshman Seth Collins and redshirt freshman Nick Mitchell, who played in his first college game Saturday. It's telling that Mitchell was on the field in the fourth quarter with the game on the line. Beavers report card \nCollins is a dynamic runner who leads the team in rushing with 536 yards, but he has struggled in the passing game. Mitchell has a more accurate arm, but lacks Collins' mobility and was sacked four times. \nThe best quarterback on the roster might be junior Darel Garretson, but the transfer from Utah State won't be an option until next season due to NCAA transfer rules. \nWhether it's Collins or Mitchell or both, OSU can't win games by producing just one offensive touchdown. The offense amassed a respectable 401 total yards, but just 13 points. \n\"Our defense played a really good game,\" Mitchell said. \"At the end of the day it comes down to offense and our execution.\" \nAndersen has been in rebuilding mode before. Utah State was in worse shape than the Beavers when he took over in 2009, and in Year 4 under Andersen the Aggies went 11-2 and were nationally ranked in the final polls. \nBut the prospect of a brighter future provides little consolation as the losses mount. \n\"It sucks,\" junior linebacker Rommel Mageo said. \"Losing's never good, especially (when) you let one slip away like that.\" \nThe road doesn't get any easier for the Beavers beginning Saturday at Utah, which is coming off its first loss of the season at USC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:16:21.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
