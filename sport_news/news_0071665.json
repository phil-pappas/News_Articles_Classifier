You tell me.\" \n\nWu added that a number of safeguards have been introduced to protect the sport's integrity. \n\nThese include AIBA selecting, paying and grading the best referees, rather than officials being selected by national boxing federations, he said. \n\nWu added that referees are also not allowed to bring smartphones into the boxing arena, so they can have no outside contact. \n\n\"What happened in the past is that all the referees came with the national team. All the problems happened because of the system. \n\n\"If referees don't perform well they are demeaning the sport,\" said Wu while speaking at Ali Bin Hamad Al Attiya Arena, the 7,700-seater Doha venue being used for the 18th edition of the championships. \n\nIn total, 258 boxers from 74 countries will be fighting across 10 weight classes in Qatar. \n\nIt is the first time all those competing have had to qualify for the World Championships. \n\nAt stake is not only the chance to win a world title but also qualification for the Rio Olympics next year. \n\nSome 23 qualifying spots for the Olympics will be on offer in Doha. \n\nFighters from five continents will take part with Europe supplying the largest number, 94. \n\nHosts Qatar will have a five-man team for the first boxing world championships to be held in the Middle East. \n\n\"They bring a lot of sporting events into the region but never boxing, so it's time for Qatar,\" Wu told AFP. \n\nThe major draws are expected to come from the powerhouse boxing nations, including Cuba, which is sending a 10-man squad, including former champion Lazaro Alvarez competing at 60kg (130lbs). \n\nRussia will bring seven fighters and former Soviet republic Kazakhstan will provide 2013 champion Zhanibek Alimkhanuly at 75kg (165lbs). \n\nA former boxer of the year, Azerbaijan's Mahammadrasul Majidov, will fight in the Super Heavyweight division 91kg (200lbs). \n\nIreland's team captain, Michael Conlan, will be looking to go better than his bronze at the London Olympics three years ago. \n\nWu, a Taiwanese national, said that more than 500 million people will watch the event on television or social media such as YouTube, the highest ever audience for the event. \n\nAnd he added that the standard of the fighting will be as high as ever before at the championships. \n\n\"The fitness of the boxers is surprising. They are very, very strong. They are very, very fit. This is real boxing, we are confident the event will attract many people,\" said Wu.
