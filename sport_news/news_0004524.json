The ball sat on TCU’s 42-yard line. As he dropped back he saw the deep post. \nEverything was there. Until it wasn’t. \nTCU’s Nick Orr came unblocked on a blitz. He smashed Richardson before the quarterback could throw it, the ball popping out into the hands of TCU’s Josh Carraway. \nFinding the end zone once getting to midfield is a reoccurring problem for Iowa State, one that requires a new mindset before facing No. 2 Baylor on Saturday (11 a.m., ESPN). \n“It’s your attitude that has to change, crossing the 50 and to make sure it’s of the utmost importance to get into the red zone,” Richardson said. \nThe Cyclones are moving the football fine. Something changes once getting into enemy territory. They are last in the Big 12 in red zone touchdown scoring at 52.0 percent. Nineteen of their drives in opponent’s territory during regulation resulted in no points. ISU has 12 touchdowns. \n“We are stopping ourselves,” offensive coordinator Mark Mangino said. “Our wounds on offense are self-inflicted.” \nThey were against No. 4 TCU last week. The Cyclones scored 21 points on their first three possessions. They didn’t score the rest of the game despite getting into Horned Frog territory on five of their six other drives. \nTwo ended in turnovers, including the Richardson fumble. One was a punt on a fourth-and-three at the TCU 45 and two others were turnover on downs. \nFailing to convert on scoring chances slowly turned a 21-14 ISU lead into a one-sided 45-21 TCU victory. The Horned Frogs are second nationally in scoring. The Bears (6-0, 3-0 Big 12) are first. The Cyclones (2-4, 1-2) know an inability to find the end zone when facing such high-scoring offenses makes an upset nearly impossible. \n“Momentum definitely got away from us and we never did anything to get it back,” Richardson said. “I think with a team like that they can run away from you pretty quick.” \nTo keep pace, the Cyclones must cut down their penalties. They committed eight last week, including three inside their opponent’s territory. Those came on two drives, a hold by offensive tackle Jaypee Philbert negated a potential field goal opportunity before ISU later committed a turnover. Two false start penalties came on a second-half drive where the Cyclones failed to score. \n“We got to stop it,” Mangino said. “We’ve got to be more disciplined in our play and some of these penalties. If we can’t get them cleaned up through coaching and good mental discipline then we are going to have to pull some people and put them on the side and maybe play somebody up front that maybe has lesser talent, but will play smart football. We just can’t have those issues anymore.” \nThere were wide receiver false starts against TCU, which coach Paul Rhoads called “ridiculous.” \nOffensive tackle Jake Campos was one player Mangino identified as needing to play more disciplined. Campos recorded three penalties, including two false starts, over the last three games. \nCampos will have a tough assignment in stopping Baylor All-American defensive end Shawn Oakman this weekend. The 6-foot-9, 275-pound Oakman has 7.5 tackles for loss and three sacks. \n“He’s a real freak athlete,” Campos said, “a huge guy coming out because that’s a really different challenge than a lot of guys because he is going to have a length advantage on me, which most guys don’t have, but also he’s very, very tall, which helps me a little bit in the run game and I’ll be able to get under him a little bit.” \nCampos must be aggressive with Oakman. A similar philosophy may help when ISU looks to score. \n“People are waiting for someone to make a play,” running back Joshua Thomas said. “I think people need to take initiative and be like give me the ball. Let me make this play.” \nNavigating the end zone \nNineteen Iowa State drives in opposing territory have not yielded points this season. Here is a breakdown of how each one ended. \nTurnovers - 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:32:32.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
