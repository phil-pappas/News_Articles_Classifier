His goal is the same as every other Thrall Tiger, but the strength is took him to say it out loud is far greater. \nMeiske has no hearing in his right ear, and only 10-15 percent hearing in his left ear. \n\"During the game, I just watch the ball. Whenever the ball moves, I just snap off,\" he said. Hearing-impaired senior stars on gridiron \nDuring practice and in games, he wears a hearing aid in his left ear, which improves his ability to hear to 75 percent. Sweat can interfere with it, which can reduce the hearing aid's effectiveness. \nThe senior is a starter on the defensive line, and uses his speed and athleticism to wreak havoc in the backfield. \n\"It's one of those ones where they just want you to believe in them. So I saw something in Denton, and we just clicked right from the beginning,\" said first-year defensive line coach Karl Bielfeldt. \nTheir connection extends far off the field. \n\"Well I guess this is, you know, where fate and blessing has it. My roommate in college was deaf -- and my brother is deaf -- so I kind of grew up in that community,\" said Bielfeldt. \n\"I had tears and I had goosebumps for the rest of the day. Because I was like, 'God brought you to Thrall for one reason,\" said Melissa Meiske, Denton's mom. \nDenton was born with severe hearing loss. His family didn't know the extent until he was 18 months old. He has worn a hearing aid since he was two. Now 18 and a senior, he has an aide who helps him in class and with his studies. \n\"Denton's always had one goal, one dream. To be a Thrall Tiger,\" said Melissa. \nDenton attended school in Round Rock ISD for years, which had a program geared towards hearing-impaired students. After his freshman year, he wanted to return to Thrall High, where he lives with his family. \nIt's a welcome addition to a quickly rising team. \n\"He's an All-Star,\" said fellow senior Jacob Seggern, who stars with Meiske to form a dominant Tiger defense. One of his closest friends, Seggern said on the field it's tough to notice any difference. \n\"We want everybody to be equal on the team. It's teamwork, it's not the individual,\" said Seggern. \nMeiske prefers to speak instead of sign. Coaches and teammates say at times, they'll go over plays or instructions a bit more slowly, but the 6-foot 2-inch, 190-pound defensive lineman lets his athletic instincts take over. \nHis words of encouragement to others hoping to follow his path are simple. \n\"Follow your heart,\" Denton said.
