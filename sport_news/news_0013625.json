Hong , AP \nLOS ANGELES — Bo Horvat remembers it all like it was yesterday. \nThat’s why he’s good today and will be even better tomorrow. His appetite for learning is only surpassed by his willingness to accept and excel when presented with considerable challenges. \nWhen Horvat played just his fourth NHL regular-season game here on Nov. 9, 2014, he was thrown into the deep end of the development pool by coach Willie Desjardins. No wading in against the defending Stanley Cup-champion Kings. \nThe raw rookie had to sink or swim. \nHe took draws against Anze Kopitar, Jeff Carter and Jarret Stoll and while the Canucks would lose 5-1 that night, Horvat won the admiration of his coach for winning 55 per cent of his faceoffs and logging 14:53 of ice time. He played just 8:52 in his first game last season and 7:18 in his second. \nThe vote of confidence against the Kings was a springboard for becoming a demon on draws and defensively sound. \n“It meant a lot,” recalled Horvat. “It was the turning point in my season and I knew getting off to a good start like that would definitely help me. I was still doing my nine-game stint and for Willie to put me out there — it was kind of like my first real test and I thought I did a good job of it. And I thought my line (he was aligned with Brad Richardson and Shawn Matthias) played well. I knew as I kept getting more ice and that feeling that maybe I was playing better and that he (Desjardins) was trying to test me.” \nThe coach’s faith allowed Horvat to be bolder. Four games after the L.A. loss he would score his first NHL goal — calling for the puck, taking a cross-ice feed from Derek Dorsett and snapping a wrist shot from the slot past Frederik Andersen — and the next game he added three assists against Chicago. Horvat went a gaudy 13-for-16 in the circle against the Blackhawks (81 per cent). It allowed him to transition offensively and he would score four times in a seven-game span in March to finish with 13 goals. \nStill, that Kings clash wasn’t seamless. Horvat took an early hooking penalty trying to corral Kopitar and lost a board battle that resulted in the fourth L.A. goal. But he never backed down. And if Jake Virtanen can say he did that in his regular-season debut Tuesday — combining a willingness to get physically involved along the wall and take pucks to the net — then the Abbotsford product will know what the first Staples Centre exposure did for Horvat. \nWhich, of course, is good. Desjardins doesn’t set players up for failure. But he also doesn’t ease their adjustment to the NHL because what real purpose would that serve? It gives the coach a quick read on the mental makeup of a young player, how he prepares mentally and physically and how he handles scrutiny. \nHorvat has won 51.1 per cent of his draws through three games this season and on Monday in Anaheim, he was at 80-per-cent efficiency after two periods in going four-for-five in getting the better of Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler. He’s also averaging 17:56 of ice time, is on the second power-play unit and part of the penalty kill. \nAnd even though Desjardins was somewhat reluctant to start last season with a 19-year-old rookie, his handling of the 2013 first-round pick was a big reason Horvat came to camp this fall and wrestled away the second-line centre spot. \n“Absolutely,” agreed Horvat. “He puts me out in situations where I wasn’t going to get hurt from it, but at the same time I was going to learn and he’s pretty good at balancing it. He just wanted me to focus on being good in the circle and playing well defensively. This year, I have the freedom to work more in the offensive zone.” \nNot that Horvat hasn’t forgotten what got him here. He studies video to get a book on opposition centres. And even though the NHL has now dictated that players on the defensive side of centre ice must put their blades down first in hopes of creating more offence, it doesn’t bug Bo. \nHe’s a bull and likes to use his strength to muscle players out of the faceoff dot. \n“I like to have my stick down first anyways,” said Horvat. “I feel more ready for the draw rather thanhaving my stick in the air.” \nMaybe we should have seen all this coming. Horvat’s skating was always in question and he worked so hard at it the last three summers that he simply bolts away from defenders. \nHorvat’s ability to handle the heat of being the sole return in the draft-day trade of Cory Schneider — the Canucks got the No. 9 pick from New Jersey in that shocker — speaks to his demeanour and projection as a future captain. And when he played his first regular-season game on Nov. 4 last season in Colorado — taking the opening draw with Henrik Sedin and Radim Vrbata — we shouldn’t have been surprised that he won eight of 12 faceoffs. \n“It was hard to describe, a moment I was dreaming about,” summed up Horvat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:04:43.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
