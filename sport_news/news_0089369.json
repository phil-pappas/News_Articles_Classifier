(Photo: Harry How, Getty Images) \nToronto â€” Marco Estrada pitched one-hit ball into the eighth inning, giving Toronto's tattered bullpen a rest and leading the Blue Jays over the Kansas City Royals 7-1 Wednesday to close to 3-2 in the American League Championship Series.\nTroy Tulowitzki broke open the game with a three-run double off Kelvin Herrera in the sixth, giving him seven RBIs in the series. Edwin Encarnacion had walked with the bases loaded against Edinson Volquez, who seemed flustered by close calls against the Royals.\nEstrada faced the minimum 20 batters before Lorenzo Cain walked with two outs in the sixth. Closer Roberto Osuna was perfect in the ninth.\nToronto forced the series back to Kansas City, where Yordano Ventura will start for the defending AL champions on Friday against David Price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:56:47.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
