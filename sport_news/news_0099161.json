But that is usually the case. A team that depends on rookies as much as the Cubs is usually in a rebuild mode from the beginning or turns in that direction when the arc of its season becomes apparent.\nThe three most recent teams to have at least as many rookie plate appearances as these Cubs – the 2014 Red Sox, 2013 Marlins and 2012 Rockies – all finished in last place. That the Cubs are going to the playoffs has much to do with having candidates for the NL MVP (Anthony Rizzo), Cy Young (Jake Arrieta) and Manager of the Year (Joe Maddon).\nBut it hinges on having a candidate for Rookie of the Year (Kris Bryant) plus standouts Addison Russell, Kyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler, all of whom had at least 250 plus plate appearances.\nSince 2000, 10 other clubs have had at least four rookies take 250-plus plate appearances, and nine finished with 78 or fewer victories. The exception was the 2005 Braves, who won 90 games and the NL East with rookies Jeff Francoeur, Kelly Johnson, Wilson Betemit and Ryan Langerhans playing frequently – and another rookie, Brian McCann, finishing with 204 plate appearances.\nBut that was the end of something. Atlanta made the last of 14 straight postseasons in 2005 as all of those rookies – except McCann – failed to fulfill their peak promise. You get the feeling this is just the start of a special run for these Cubs.\n  addison russell ,  chicago cubs ,  kris bryant ,  mlb playoffs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:26:06.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
