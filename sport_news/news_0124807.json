(Getty Images) \nGame 2 of the NLDS between the Mets and Dodgers in Los Angeles really looked like it was going New York's way for most of the night. Noah Syndergaard and Zack Greinke were locked in a pitchers' duel that almost (but not quite) upstaged what Jacob deGrom and Clayton Kershaw exhibited in Game 1. This was a fun one on both ends, with Syndergaard's heat, at times reaching 101 mph, and Grienke's Madduxian control leaving almost every hitter confused and despondent. It was simply great baseball to watch. \nAnd then Chase Utley slid into Ruben Tejada in the bottom of the seventh, and that's when everything went to hell, for the Mets, for the Dodgers, for Tejada, and for the hope of reasonable discourse about this series. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nIt became an ugly, emotionally charged controversy that is bound to dominate New York tabloids right up to when the first pitch of Game 3 leaves Matt Harvey's hand on Monday night. \nThe Mets and Dodgers already have a long and intertwined history. They've played memorable playoff games before. But the NLDS between them was already reaching for an all-time place in playoff history. What was not needed was what happened to Tejada's leg thanks to Utley's carelessness, but here we are. The Dodgers won, 5-2, and now either team can end the series in New York by winning the next two. \nHere are the facts regarding the Utley play: He slid into second to try and break up a double play, Utley's helmet smashed into Tejada's left leg (the impact of Utley's body broke Tejada's right fibula), and the umpires, upon further review, called Utley safe because Tejada's foot wasn't on second for the force, even though Utley never touched second and left the field of play. There is a dissertation's worth of debate along the margins there: Was Utley even sliding, since it came so late? How could a player be called safe on any play when he never actually touched the base? (On that point, as Joe Torre explained after the game , the Mets could have tagged Utley out on the way to the dugout, although they seemed to have bigger concerns with Tejada writhing on the ground in pain.) And how about Utley's years-long history ( exhibit A , exhibit B ) of doing this sort of thing? \nMLB.com's Anthony DiComo answers a lot of those questions here . And MLB Network analyst Brian Kenny addresses the interference rule on SoE . \nBut the simple truth is that Utley broke Tejada's leg, and the Dodgers were then rewarded when the initial call was reversed upon review. I understand that Dodgers fans must be happy that it all worked out in favor of their team, but there's a kind of baseball that's enjoyable and a kind that's sickening to witness and last night's version skewed straight to the latter in a blink. \nIt didn't need to happen this way, not with Syndergaard and Greinke nearly matching each other out for out. Aside from two solo home runs allowed to Yoenis Cespedes and Michael Conforto in the second inning, Greinke was his vintage self, keeping Mets hitters fooled with late movement, a mid-90s fastball, and paint-the-black precision. His five hits, no walks, and eight strikeouts in seven innings were enough to earn the victory on this night, but it looked as if his 23-year-old flame-throwing counterpart would steal that W with his gasp-inducing heat. Syndergaard cracked 100 mph or more 15 times on Saturday night; he had only done that 15 times all season. In all, 50 batters have struck out in the first two games of the series, an all-time record for a series' initial two games. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nAt its best, this series has been tense and dramatic, featuring some of the game's best pitchers trying to outmatch hitters like Cespedes and Adrian Gonzalez, who delivered the decisive blow in Game 2 after looking completely lost until then. The game turned fast, the series turned fast, and now we're tied heading back to New York for Game 3. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nMLB needs to figure out a way to protect middle-infielders from this kind of injury -- which, for the record, is completely avoidable; you just need to disincentivize it -- but that's for the offseason agenda. There is still a series to win, the Mets are still in control of home-field advantage, and if they truly want to exert some kind of retribution on Utley and the Dodgers, they can do so by winning the next two games and sending Utley and his teammates home for good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:32:48.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
