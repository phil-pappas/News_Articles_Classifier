Leeds have not won at Elland Road in over seven months. \n\" From the very early days of Massimo Cellino's majority share ownership of Leeds United, it was clear the support was in for a rollercoaster ride. Unfortunately it's been a downhill one,\" the statement continued. \n\"The Trust has consistently said that the club should put the stability and the needs of the support at the top of its agenda. \n\"Alas, for reasons only Massimo Cellino can explain, this is not happening. What is happening is that Mr Cellino appears to be in media a lot for his activities - the vast majority of which seem to signal yet another Leeds United crisis. \n\"Constant head-coach changes (with the subsequent need to make expensive pay-offs), is doing nothing for the evolution of a footballing squad more than capable of challenging in this division. \n\"All this upheaval is damaging to the young players we nurture and to the reputation of the club. If Massimo Cellino is not prepared to acknowledge England is not Italy and that coaches cannot be sacked at the rate of four a season, it seems to point to who the major source of instability is. \n\"Equally, the constant nature of off-piste issues (Italian court-cases, in and out managing directors, the non purchase of Elland Road) is helping to encase the clubs reputation of being constantly in crisis.\" \nCellino appointed former Hull chairman and ex-Leeds director Adam Pearson as his right-hand man in the summer, a move which was welcomed by fans and steered the club into calmer waters. \nBut Pearson announced his shock departure in mid-September due to personal reasons, while Cellino enraged fans last week by announcing he was capping the ticket allocation for Leeds' away fans to 2,000 in protest at the number of the club's games televised live by Sky Sports. \n\"As such, it is easy to see why the events of last week (particularly the ticket allocation debacle) and Monday (the sacking of Uwe Rosler and the employment of Steve Evans) have instilled a sense of despair in the loyal fan base,\" the statement added. \n\"The Trust calls on Massimo Cellino to acknowledge the need for real stability, manifest in stable football management and consideration of the needs of the long-suffering support.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:14:44.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
