(WKYT) - Kentucky has reached mid season with a record of 4-2 and Mark Stoops is not discouraged as he takes his team on the road to Mississippi State Saturday. The Cats are coming off a difficult 30-27 loss to Auburn last Thursday night. \n\"But the truth is, just like we said going into the season, that we're a better football team, said Stoops. \"I think our body of work through half the season, that's pretty evident.\" \nEvery game Kentucky has played has gone right down to the final possession, the Cats could have won all of them. \n\"Ya know we're very disappointed we did not beat the two teams that we lost to in Florida and Auburn,\" Stoops said. We had our opportunities. We just need to continue to build and get better and find those ways to win those games.\" \nKentucky has not defeated Mississippi State since 2008 in Starkville. The Bulldogs are 5-2, (1-2 SEC), a veteran team with a great leader in quarterback Dak Prescott. \n\"Very good football team that's used to winning a bunch of games, led by an incredible quarterback who's got great leadership skills. Very talented, can run, is throwing the ball exceptionally well this year. A good, experienced football team. \nThe Cats continue to struggle in the kicking game. Stoops is hopeful Austin McGinnis will be able to handle kickoffs this weekend.and he's looking for a lot of improvement from punter Landon Foster. \n\"We just have not been effective enough in the kicking game with Austin being hurt, really put us behind the eight ball with Miles (Butler) having to do the kickoffs. And then with the punts, we have not kicked the ball well enough, you've heard me talk about it, its been several weeks now and in a close ball game it hurts you.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:07:30.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
