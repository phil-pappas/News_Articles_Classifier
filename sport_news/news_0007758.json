He filed nomination papers before being suspended by the FIFA ethics committee this month and could be barred as a candidate.\nAn Infantino candidacy could strengthen the Europe-Asia alliance in FIFA politics.\nThough Infantino, a Swiss lawyer, would likely be an outsider to win, he was already viewed as a contender to be appointed FIFA secretary general after the Feb. 26 election.\nOther probable candidates vying for the FIFA job include Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, South African tycoon Tokyo Sexwale, former FIFA official Jerome Champagne and David Nakhid, a former player from Trinidad and Tobago.\nSheikh Salman's expected entry was already being criticized by rights groups who urged FIFA's election committee to reject him as a candidate when it conducts integrity checks.\nQuestions have been raised over whether Sheikh Salman adequately protected Bahrain national team players after some took part in pro-democracy protests in 2011. Some players say they were tortured while detained by government forces when the sheikh was head of the Bahrain Football Association.\nWhen Sexwale declared his campaign on Saturday, the Apartheid-era political prisoner seemed likely to be the only African contender. But Bility said Monday that more than 25 of the 54 African voting federations offered to nominate him.\n\"I wanted to make sure that it was worth going into the campaign,\" Bility said.\n___\nAP Sports Writer Rob Harris in Manchester, England, contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
