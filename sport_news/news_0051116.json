Thus far in 2015 there has been no such misery. \nThe improvement can be credited, at least in part, to first year WSU defensive back Shalom Luani, who sealed the win at Oregon with his overtime interception. In six games, he has made a name for himself as a bruising, playmaking safety. \nLuani caught Mike Leach's eye as a punishing safety at City College of San Francisco. \n\"I felt like he jumped off the screen,\" Leach said. \"He was a hard hitter. \n\"And hit hard to the point where I actually expected him to be bigger in person when I met him.\" \nLuani wasted little time making his mark on the Cougars secondary. \n\"His first seven-on-seven he went out there and instantly made an impact. I think he got a pick his first seven-on-seven,\" WSU quarterback Luke Falk said. \"Instantly I saw he was a player and fall camp he's hitting the crap out of our offensive guys.\" \n\"I think now it's coming together for him,\" Leach added. \"He's starting to get into a rhythm, he's playing faster, he's seeing it better.\" \nThat was demonstrated in Saturday's performance against Oregon State, highlighted by two interceptions, the first of which he returned 84 yards for a touchdown. \n\"It was just me doing my job,\" Luani said after the game. \"Doing what I was coached to do, and being able to make plays.\" \nEven when he's not forcing turnovers, Luani is giving offenses something to think about. Especially those players who dare venture into his territory. \n\"I think for a guy who's on the opposing team the receivers are scared to cross the middle with him back there,\" defensive lineman Darryl Paulo said. \"He's a very hard hitter and he's fun to watch on film.\" \nLeach says he's the hardest hitter he's coached at WSU - mentioning guys like current teammate Hercules Mata'afa, Gonzaga Prep grad Travis Long, and - of course - Deone Bucannon. \n\"Bucannon was a big hitter too,\" Leach said. \"But Bucannon looked like one. Bucannon, you had a guy built like an outside linebacker.\" \nBut as far as the hardest hitter Leach has ever coached - that answer is easy. \n\"Dwayne Slay,\" Leach said. \"You would see guys run routes on other teams, and as they got inside the hash they would just gear down and I mean it was visible on film where these guys would just pack it in because they weren't going anywhere near Dwayne Slay.\" \nAccording to Leach, Slay is the undisputed champ. But now there is a new contender. \nCertainly Shalom is working his way that direction \nThe numbers show Luani's impact through six games. He is tied for 2nd on the team with 46 tackles. His three interceptions lead the Cougs, while his three pass breakups share the top spot, as do his two forced fumbles.
