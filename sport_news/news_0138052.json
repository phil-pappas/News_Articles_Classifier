Canyons defeated Allan Hancock College 42-24 in a National Division, Northern League game at Hancock. \nValencia High graduate Nick Jones caught eight passes for 177 yards and a touchdown for COC. He effectively put the game out of reach when he caught a short pass from Devon Dunn over the middle and sprinted away from the Bulldogs’ pursuit to put Canyons ahead 35-10 with 8:12 left in the third quarter. \nThe state No. 6 ranked Cougars are now 6-1 overall, 3-0 in conference. The banged up Bulldogs (3-4, 1-2), ranked 18th, suffered their third straight loss. \nKenny Torrence, the leading Cougars rusher going in, gained 64 and ran for a touchdown Saturday. The Canyons defense, which had allowed just 13 touchdowns coming into the day, was good enough on Saturday. \n“We don’t have a lot of guys with flashy stats,” Canyons head coach Ted Iacenda said afterward. “We just have a lot of guys who do a great job and play football the way it should be played.” \nStarting defensive back Malik Pope and dynamic return man Malik Williams, who had also been the Bulldogs’ lead running back, both missed their second straight game after being injured two weeks ago. \nHancock safety Rafael Arellano couldn’t go either after suffering a shoulder injury in the first half against Cerritos last week. \n“They were really banged up,” Iacenda acknowledged. “Malik (Williams) not being able to play definitely aided us.” \nAside from all that reception yardage, Jones had a key 16-yard run that set up a Dunn touchdown in the second quarter that gave the Cougars a 28-10 halftime lead. \nOn an earlier drive in the quarter, Jones caught four passes for a total of 58 yards. Dunn finished the 65-yard march by scoring from a yard out on a quarterback sneak. \nThe Cougars stung the Bulldogs with two early scores. Torrence ran for a total of 41 yards and caught a pass for nine on the first possession of the game. Torrence did the honors himself, scoring from 2 yards out to cap an 85-yard drive. \nIsaiah Foster recovered Hancock back Dy’Kari Hickey’s fumble for Canyons at the Bulldogs 27. Dunn hit Chauncey Werah with a 10-yard touchdown pass four plays later. \nThe Bulldogs briefly took the momentum back. Curry Parham’s 58-yard run on a quarterback option set up Justin Banks’ 12-yard touchdown run, and Jose Morales kicked a 34-yard field goal shortly thereafter to pull Hancock within 14-10 . \nHowever, the Canyons defense settled in after Parham’s big run and the Banks scoring run. Linebacker Garrett Updegraft helped lead the surge as the Cougars checked the Bulldogs option game which had shown promise against Cerritos. \n“We actually had a missed assignment on Curry’s big run,” said Iacenda. “The guy who was supposed to go after the quarterback went after the running back and Curry got loose. \n“We figured it out after that, and kept it in check. I was happy with that.” \nHancock gained 256 yards on the ground but it was, for the most part, a quiet 256. \nTorrence left the game with 6:18 remaining in the third quarter and did not return. \n“We just wanted to give Kenny a rest and give some other guys some work,” Iacenda said. “Kenny runs so hard, and he was taking some hard hits. We just wanted to give him a rest. Kenny is fine.” \nBesides being the leading Canyons rusher with 81 yards, Dunn threw for 305 yards and the two scores. Hancock’s Jericho Worrell led all rushers with 92 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:18:21.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
