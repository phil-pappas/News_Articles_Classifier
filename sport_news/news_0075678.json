And curmudgeonly manager Ned Yost, finally cracking a smile. And stoic closer Wade Davis, who let out a fierce roar Friday night when the Royals recorded the final out in Game 6 of the A.L.

Then the weather hit, a 45-minute rain delay that sent fans scurrying for the concourses and threatened to put a damper on what had been a festive night for KC. \nAfter the delay, Cain calmly worked a leadoff walk from Blue Jays closer Roberto Osuna, and Hosmer followed with a clean single that Bautista fielded down the right-field line. \nRather than hit the cutoff man, though, Bautista threw to second. That gave the speedy Cain, running full speed and waved home by third base coach Mike Jirschele, just enough time to beat the relay throw from second base with a textbook slide that ignited a sellout crowd. \n\"I felt like I cut it off quick enough to where if I threw to second I could prevent him from going to second and Cain from scoring,\" Bautista said, \"but I was wrong.\" \nThen it was up to Davis, who got the Royals out of a jam in the eighth, to finish it off. \nBen Zobrist and Mike Moustakas homered, and Alex Rios also drove in a run for Kansas City, while shortstop Alcides Escobar was voted MVP after going 11 for 23 in the series.

Mets: Outfielder Yoenis Cespedes has received a cortisone injection in his sore left shoulder, and the team expects him to be ready for the World Series next week. Cespedes left Wednesday night's N.L. Championship Series finale at Chicago in the second inning. \nThe slugger had the injection on Thursday and was told not to participate in baseball activities for 24 hours, Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said. Cespedes did not attend Friday's voluntary workout at Citi Field. Mariners: Seattle hired former big league catcher Scott Servais as its manager Friday, giving the job to someone with ties to the new front office but no experience running a team. The 48-year-old Servais replaces Lloyd McClendon, who was fired earlier this month after Seattle went 76-86. Servais will be formally introduced by the team next week. Red Sox: Ten weeks after being diagnosed with cancer, Boston manager John Farrell was given a clean bill of health by doctors and cleared to resume regular activities to the extent his body will allow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:29:30.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
