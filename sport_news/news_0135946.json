Whaley says tests showed the concussion on Monday, a day after Williams complained of not feeling well following a 21-10 loss to the New York Giants. \nWilliams is following the NFL's concussion protocol, and must pass a series of tests before being cleared to play. Buffalo (2-2) plays at Tennessee (1-2) on Sunday. \nWilliams was hurt after making his first start filling in for LeSean McCoy, who is out indefinitely because of a hamstring injury. \nThe Bills have only two other running backs on their roster, Boobie Dixon and Cierre Wood, plus fullback Jerome Felton. \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:14:19.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
