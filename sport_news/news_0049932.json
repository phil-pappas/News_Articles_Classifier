It hasn't quite set in yet, but I know what it means, I know what it is and I'm very thankful for that and appreciative of it.\" \nDavid Robertson pitched the ninth for his 34th save. \nAdam Eaton led the way offensively for Chicago, with a double and two RBIs, while Alfredo Simon started and took the loss for the Tigers. \nRookie Jefry Marte provided the lone Detroit run with a solo homer off Sale in the second inning, giving the Tigers a 1-0 lead, but the White Sox's ace settled into a groove soon after. \nSale needed three strikeouts to pass Walsh's mark and he tied it with two in the first then eclipsed it in the second after he gave up Marte's homer when he struck out Detroit catcher James McCann. \nHis accomplishment was noted on the video boards in the outfield concourse and the smattering of fans in attendance gave him an ovation. \n\"There was a lot of stuff going on. I felt like I couldn't really pitch until I got (the record), and then after that I kind of settled in,\" Sale added. \"It was a great experience and something I'll never forget.\" \nSale's team mates made the game a little more special in the third, handing him a 2-1 lead following a two-run double by Eaton. \nSale and the White Sox's bullpen took it from there. \n\"He's a very good pitcher,\" said Tigers shortstop Dixon Machado, who went 1-for-3. \n\"The way that he throws, and he was down in the zone throwing a fast ball for strikes. \n\"Pitchers who can throw hard and throw strikes, they're really hard to hit.\" \n(Compiled by Greg Stutchbury)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:34:36.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
