The reason is the ball is getting rough and old and not having too much pace, and thus difficult to get to the boundaries,\" Kohli said at the pre-match press conference here on Saturday, ahead of Sunday's fifth and final ODI against South Africa at the Wankhede Stadium.\n\nThe series stands level at 2-2 after India won the fourth and penultimate match in Chennai.\n\n\"I think it won't be difficult to play outside the sub continuent because it won't be a bad game being five fielders outside the circle, more chances to rotate strike. It will be interesting to see how the rule work abroad. With change of games, more of running between the wickets need to be done to get the scoring on way. It has become difficult specially in the late part of the innings,\" Kohli added.\n\nPowered by a superb ton (138) from Kohli, India defeated South Africa by 35 runs Chennai to level things up and the Delhi lad asserted that the win has boosted the morale in the squad.\n\n\"Winning the last game gave us a lot of confidence. Mood is very good in the camp. We haven't played collective cricket before the last game. And the win did help us. We have figured out what needs to be done. Everyone has got runs under their belt and which is important and is good for us,\" the 26-year-old said.\n\n\"This Wankhede pitch should have more carry and bounce. The match will be interesting to watch with the wicket having pace and we are ready to play an exciting game,\" he added.\n\nExperienced South African batsman AB de villiers scored 112 from 107 deliveries while chasing in the fourth ODI to nearly take the game away from the hosts.\n\nSpeaking on de Villiers, the Delhi-born batsman said, \"Everyone has the ability to play cricket but he is different. I know him closely. He is an adorable person. I am glad that I am not a bowler. We have a few plans for every batsman. But to have plans for AB, is a bit difficult as he is in superb form.\"\n\n\"We have plans and we can execute them, but since he is in form, he just might nullify them. I am confident our bowlers will be charged up to execute the plans and give their best,\" Kohli concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:32:44.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
