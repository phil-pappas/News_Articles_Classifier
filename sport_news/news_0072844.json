Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images The Chicago Blackhawks shut out the Dallas Stars 4-0 on Saturday night at the United Center to end what has been a preseason of frustration for the men in Victory Green. Marian Hossa scored twice for the Hawks; Patrick Kane and Andrew Shaw contributed the remaining two tallies. Antti Niemi started the game for the Stars and stopped 17 out 18 shots before being replaced by Kari Lehtonen for the third period. Lehtonen allowed three goals on 11 shots.\nWith a preseason record of 1-6-0, Dallas has three days the regular season opens on Oct. 8 against the Pittsburgh Penguins to answer some tough questions. Before the game on Saturday, coach Lindy Ruff told the media he wasn’t going to “get too down about what’s behind us,” adding that, “When we start, we’re going to start even with everybody.” And while this is true, and the preseason is the place to work out the kinks, some of the numbers and mistakes from these seven games are cause for concern.\nContinued goaltending drama\nWhen Jim Nill acquired Antti Niemi in the offseason, it was viewed widely as an insurance policy in case Kari Lehtonen was unable to bounce back from a career low season. It was also seen as a move to finally provide Dallas with the quality backup goaltending the Big D hasn’t seen in years. And if it also created a little competition for the net? Maybe it was a good thing.\nThe reality is Dallas now has $10.4 million in cap space invested in two once great but seemingly in-decline goaltenders. As Mike Heika of the Dallas Morning News points out, the Stars posted the worst preseason goaltending numbers in the league. A recent anonymous poll of 14 NHL coaches, general managers and goalie coaches ranked Kari Lehtonen the fourth worst starter . It’s an issue that has been railed on repeatedly over the summer, and it doesn’t seem to be going away any time soon.\nDiscipline and focus\nThe strength of the Dallas Stars is their speed and offensive punch. To say Dallas is deep with forward talent would be an understatement. When you have names like Benn, Seguin, Sharp and Spezza on your team, you’re going to score goals. But the downside of this fast-paced, get up and go style of play is the potential for mistakes. More than anything last season, not playing a disciplined, defensively-responsible game was the downfall of the Stars. Dallas needs to commit to playing 60 full minutes each night, cutting down penalty time and not leaving their goaltender out to dry.\nHealthy Benn, Nichushkin, Hemsky\nJamie Benn and Ales Hemsky had hip surgery in the offseason. The preseason indicated steps in the right direction for both players, but it’s going to be a little longer before either one is playing the game they want. Val Nichushkin is also looking to have a bigger impact on the team this season after being limited to eight games last season due to hip surgery. He still struggles with positioning at times but the potential for the 20-year-old Russian winger to have a breakout season is certainly there.", "external_links": ["http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-stars/headlines/20151001-nhl-general-managers-coaches-rank-stars-kari-lehtonen-as-fourth-worst-starter-in-league.ece", "http://video.stars.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=839780&catid=1392", "http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-stars/headlines/20151004-heika-dallas-stars-using-outdoor-game-snub-as-motivation.ece", "http://stars.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/boxscore?id=2015010097"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:30:42.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
