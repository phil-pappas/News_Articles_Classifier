Gilbert scored unassisted at 7:59 to get Falmouth (4-4, 1-2 ACL) on the board, then played the ball up to senior Kelsey Azzato for a 2-0 lead at 32:17. Azzato later drew a foul in the D-Y (2-4, 0-3 ACL) penalty box, and senior captain Sam Theroux drilled the penalty kick for a 3-0 lead. Sophomore sweeper Lexa Zampanti had several good corner kicks for the Clippers, but none found their way into the back of the net. Falmouth also got solid play from senior captain Kaitlin McManus on defense and Abigail Peterson and Ashley Oliveira at midfield. Despite surrendering three goals, D-Y goalie Eilish Dillon had a solid game coming up with 16 saves. Upper Cape 12, Bristol Aggie 3: Amber DiBona had four goals and two assists while Chrissy and Nicole Destefano both tallied their first varsity goals in the Rams’ win over the Chieftains in Bourne. Sara Churchill got Upper Cape (4-6-1, 2-1 Mayflower Small) going just four minutes in on an assist from DiBona, with DiBona scoring the next four goals. Hannah Gorassi added the next two before Emma Baumhoff, Cailyn Hooper and Chrissy Destefano all scored. Destefano, a freshman, scored her first varsity goal to make it 10-1 Rams at the half. Junior Nicole Destefano, normally a sweeper, moved up to forward and got her first varsity goal, with Chrissy Destefano adding her second later in the half. Mashpee 4, Monomoy 0: Kate Wellington was a one-woman show, netting all four of the Falcons’ goals in a shutout victory over the Sharks in Harwich. Wellington scored a pair of goals off assists from Sara MacRae, with two of Mashpee’s goals coming on breakaways. Amanda Soroka was little tested in her fifth shutout of the season. The Falcons (3-3-2, 2-3-2 SSL) got dominant midfield play from MacRae, Emma McNally, Caitlin Lee and Krista Murray. Monomoy is 1-5, 0-5 in the league. Marshfield 3, Nauset 0: The Warriors played a strong second half but were unable to overcome a big halftime deficit en route to an Atlantic Coast League loss against the Rams in North Eastham. Nauset (2-4-2, 1-2 ACL) hit a pair of shots off the Marshfield post but were unable to cut into the Rams lead. Sophomore Emily McGrath and Lauren Schiffenhaus were both strong for the Warriors. Sacred Heart 11, Sturgis East 2: Sean Liddy scored twice for the Storm in a loss to the Saints at Old Townhouse Field in Yarmouth. Sturgis East (2-6) got strong minutes from Tess Puopolo at central midfield and Amanda Maxwell on defense. Sandwich 0, Barnstable 0: In a battle between teams that are at opposite ends of the standings, the Blue Knights and Red Raiders battled to a scoreless tie in Hyannis. Sandwich (5-0-1) dominated field position, but Barnstable (1-6-1) packed in its defense and relied on the stellar play of goalie Mia Crawley to keep the visitors off the board and earn the Raiders a point. Sandwich had a golden chance to score on a centering pass to Sarah McFarland, but her header sailed just over the bar. Besides McFarland, also playing well for Sandwich were her sister Molly, who was making her first varsity start, Haley Whelan and Becca Mandy. Barnstable had strong play from a number of other players including Aislin Hempstead, Collette Luczkow up top, Dajanay Mendes, Isabel Woods and Kat Papso in the midfield.
