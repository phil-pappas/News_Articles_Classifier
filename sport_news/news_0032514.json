Maumelle’s Cameron Porras drops back and locates his man in the end zone. \nHowever, the ball lands Alex Massey’s hands at the 3 and 13 seconds later, the Panthers tie the game at 34 “That was definitely the turning point,” Greenbrier coach Randy Tribble said after the 42-40 victory. “It was a very momentum-building play.” \nAs quickly as the game was tied, Maumelle reclaimed its lead, but it wouldn’t last. \nWith a little under 4:00 remaining, Harold Ross connected with Massey in the back of the end zone. Ethan Hall’s kick was good and Greenbrier had a two-point lead. \n“I’m just so proud of my kids for hanging in there and still believing that we had a chance to win,” Tribble said. “Enough guys believed and made big plays for us to win.” \nFriday night’s 5A-West meeting of Maumelle and Greenbrier on the Hornets’ turf was a battle from start to finish. \nAt the start, Greenbrier couldn’t convert on fourth down, giving Maumelle the ball at Greenbrier’s 49. Two plays later, a 39-yard rushing touchdown by the Hornets’ Demarian Johnson resulted in the first points of the night on the board. \nGreenbrier scored 28 points in the second half to earn a win. \nMaumelle’s defense was able to sack Ross. The Panther quarterback completed 11 of 27 passes for 230 yards and three touchdown as well as a 2-yard rushing touchdown. Ben Wilson led the team in receptions with five for 139 yards and one touchdown. Massey also had five receptions for 80 yards and three touchdowns. \nLeading rusher Shawn Howard had 22 carries for 94 yards. “We got sacked some, we still got some guys getting beat on pass rush, and busting protections,” Tribble said. “But one thing tonight, we ran the ball in key situations. We’re getting better at everything. Our guys just battled and battled.” \nUp next for Tribble and his Panthers is undefeated Little Rock Christian. Greenbrier (4-2, 2-1) will face the undefeated Warriors (7-0, 4-0) at Donn Jones Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:25:40.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
