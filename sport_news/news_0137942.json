He died in 1953 at age 64. \nThorpe's wife won agreement from two merging towns in Pennsylvania to build a memorial and name the new town after Thorpe. Police then seized Thorpe's body during his funeral service in Oklahoma.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:29:20.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
