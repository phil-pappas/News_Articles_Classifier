There’s pride, career, our own ambition to be ready for a game. \n“I’ve always thought since I was 12 years old, whether I was kicking a ball against a garage door in (Zambia) where I’m from, or I’m here, or I’m in Honduras, it will always be the same. It’s a game of football. It’s what I love to do.” \nEarnshaw will easily be the senior man on the pitch for the Caps, who took only two other players older than 24 — striker Darren Mattocks, 25, and goalkeeper Paolo Tornaghi, 27. \nIn fact, head coach Carl Robinson is likely to start three 19-year-olds in midfielders Deybi Flores, Marco Bustos and Kianz Froese as well as 20-year-old fullback Sam Adekugbe. \nThe Caps have been decimated by injuries to starters, with midfielders Pedro Morales, Nico Mezquida and Mauro Rosales all on the limp. So, too, are winger Cristian Techera, striker Octavio Rivero and centre back Pa-Modou Kah, as well as young Canadians Ben McKendry and Caleb Clarke, who would have made the two-day trip — the club overnighted in Houston on Tuesday — if healthy. \nWith CONCACAF and Major League Soccer refusing to allow the Caps to take Ethen Sampson, who was loaned out to WFC2 in mid-season after the acquisition of Costa Rican fullback Jordan Smith, Robinson was forced to take veteran midfielder Gershon Koffie and standout rookie centre back Tim Parker to Honduras just to have a couple of subs on the bench in case of injury. \nIt’s something he didn’t want to do given the demanding travel and the fact Vancouver plays its MLS regular season finale Sunday at BC Place Stadium against the Houston Dynamo. That’s a game that will decide where the Caps finish in the West and whether they get a first-round bye or have to play a knockout-round game at home or on the road. \nAdekugbe, Smith and centre backs Christian Dean and Diego Rodriguez will be the back line against Olimpia, with Flores, Froese, Bustos and Russell Teibert in midfield and Mattocks and Earnshaw at forward. \n“We’re a thin squad. We’re down to bare bones,” said Teibert, the 22-year-old Canadian. “But it’s going to be a good test for a lot of the young guys that are going. We’re competitive, no matter what game we’re playing in, whether it’s a pitch in a park or in front of 20,000 at BC Place. We want to win.” \nThe Caps did beat Olimpia 1-0 at BC Place on Sept. 16, but a 3-0 loss in Seattle on Sept. 23 allowed the Sounders to clinch top spot in Group F and advance to next spring’s knockout stage. \nOlimpia, too, has nothing on the line, but the Honduran champs won’t want to lose at home to an MLS side. They’re expected to cut ticket prices to try to attract a large, noisy crowd. \nDespite the Caps’ youth, Teibert thinks the club has the talent and the desire to get a win on Thursday. \n“Some of the toughest opponents we’ve had this year,” he said, “are the guys we train against. We’re full at it. It’s competitive. It’s hard to beat your teammates. Now we’re playing together. \n“We want to win. We want to show the boss that we are good enough.” \ngkingston@vancouversun.com © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun E-mail this Article Print this Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:25:44.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
