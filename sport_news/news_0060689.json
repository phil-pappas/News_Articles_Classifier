Two-time Super Bowl winning coach Mike Shanahan, the man who overcame Holmgren and the Packers for the 1998 title, will control the other. GETTY IMAGES \nMike Holmgren celebrates after leading the Green Bay Packers to the 1997 Super Bowl crown. \nNo players signed with a National Football League team will appear in the games, but many will be on the cusp of a roster in America's most popular sports competition. \nThe Southern Bowl's US-based spokesman Jarin Giesler also confirmed \"a lot\" of the players would have NFL experience. \nAfter 23 years as an NFL coach, 17 of those as a head coach, Holmgren has seen his fair share of players on the fringe of a 53-man roster. \n\"When I was coaching, one of the hardest things I had to do was, when the final cut was made from 80 to 53 players, I had to tell 27 young men their dream was over,\" he said. \n\"I didn't like it, but it was part of my job and I had to do it. Then we went and created lists of the guys that almost made the team and were [very close]. There were a lot of good football players on those lists. \n\"We are taking players from that list to play in this game.\" MOTIVATION \nOne of only two head coaches to take two different franchises to the Super Bowl (he also led the Seattle Seahawks to the 2005 league-decider), Holmgren reckoned the presence of NFL scouts for the New Zealand trip provided real motivation for players to not only make the teams, but also perform well. Ad Feedback \nA strong display in the Southern Bowl could mean \"a real shot\" to get on an NFL roster, he said. \nGiesler said approximately 50 of the 70 spots available for American players on the teams had been decided and the final rosters were likely to be announced around the end of this month after Holmgren and Shanahan had picked their teams one-for-one. \nThere will also be nine spots on each team for New Zealand or Australian players, which will be found through tryouts Giesler was hoping they would run in both countries early in the New Year. \nThat group would be known as the \"Southern Bowl practice squad\", but Giesler said there was a chance some of those players would get game time. \n\"There is somebody down there who can make it and hopefully we can find them,\" he said. \n\"To reward them for [being on the practice squad] they will suit up for the game and if the situation arises and they've proven themselves during practice, then we won't hesitate to give them a shot.\" AMBASSADORS \nSouthern Bowl organisers are also trying to secure a couple of high-profile player ambassadors for the games. \nGiesler said they had reached out to NFL Hall of Fame wide receiver and ESPN football analyst Cris Carter after he expressed interest to be involved. \nAnd while they were aware he was signed with the San Francisco 49ers and didn't want to jeopardise his NFL contract in any way, Giesler said they would love to have former Australian rugby league star Jarryd Hayne involved in a similar capacity. \n\"If there would be any way we could get approval from the NFL itself, the players association and the San Francisco 49ers, he would be a guy that we would love to be on the sidelines as an ambassador.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:57:23.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
