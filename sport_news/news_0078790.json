We need to defend better,\" the manager said. \n\"When you don't have the ball, quality means nothing and what means [thumps chest]...you have or you don't have. \n\"It was just a tactical decision, leaving super quality on the bench, but bringing tactical discipline and hoping that the team could be solid. \n\"Willian and Pedro did amazing defensive work and allowed the midfield players to be very comfortable. I continue that way, or he comes in our direction and tries to replicate the same work that Willian and Pedro did.\" \nMourinho picked teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek in his midfield but replaced him with Nemanja Matic at half-time. \nHe said: \"I wanted more solidity. He's fantastic with his vision and the decisions he makes on the pitch. But without the ball you cannot compare him, tactically, with the others.\" \nAnd on Diego Costa, who scored one and made the other on his return from suspension, Mourinho said: \"The way he was working in the past two weeks with us, I knew clearly he would bring something positive for us.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:26:15.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
