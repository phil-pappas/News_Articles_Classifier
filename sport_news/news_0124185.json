City hall is calling on all businesses to help enforce the rule - \"to amplify the fight against this daily incivility,\" and authorities have installed 30,000 new garbage bins this year with built-in ashtrays.\nButts not only cause \"visual pollution,\" city hall said in a statement, but also contain toxic products that could spread into soil and water.\nSmoking has been banned in French public buildings, restaurants and bars since 2008, but nearly 30 percent of French people still smoke regularly.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
