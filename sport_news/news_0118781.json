ON BOARD: Cowboys Kyle Feldt, Jason Taumalolo and Ben Hannant enjoy Sunday’s bus ride through Cairns. PICTURE: ZAK SIMMONDS Source: News Corp Australia \nTHE CEO and coach are already on board – now the Cowboys players want their NRL bandwagon to roll in to Cairns. \nThe push for Barlow Park to host the premiers for a regular season fixture intensifies, with CEO Greg Tonner approaching the NRL about making it happen. \nCo-captain Johnathan Thurston threw his support behind the concept when North Queensland players – plus their hard-earned trophy – visited Cairns on Sunday. \nThough the stumbling block remains logistics and corporate sponsorship, players are all for a match guaranteed to sell out. \n“It’s not the Townsville Cowboys, it’s the North Queensland Cowboys and we’re aware of that,” utility Ray Thompson said. \n“Absolutely (I’d love to play here). We play a few trial games here and it’s always a great experience and we get a good crowd. If it comes to fruition it would be a good concept.” \nIt’s understood the Cowboys will soon confirm a trial return to Cairns in 2016, a 12th visit in 14 seasons. \nYet a regular season fixture is what the fans and players are truly after. “I’d love to do it,” prop Ben Hannant said. “I’d be more than happy to come up and show what we can do.” \nWhile not likely to happen any time soon, winger Antonio Winterstein suggested Cairns not be content with just a match. \n“You might one day see a Cairns NRL side, you never know,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:22:36.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
