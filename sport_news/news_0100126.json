According to a witness, he told teammates in a huddle before a kickoff that he felt dizzy. The witness did not know whether Matthews was on the field for the touchdown that preceded the kickoff. \nHe was airlifted to a hospital in Tyler, Texas, and was listed in critical condition early Saturday afternoon. \nHe was pronounced dead shortly after 6 p.m. Eastern, the Alto schools superintendent confirmed to KTVU.com. A cause of death has not yet been determined. \nA vigil was being held at the school's football field Saturday night. \nAccording to the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research at the University of North Carolina, five high school players died last season of causes directly related to football such as head and spine injuries. Seven more high school players died from indirect causes such as heatstroke.
