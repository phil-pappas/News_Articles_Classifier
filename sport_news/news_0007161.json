But Clement got hurt in practice leading up to the season opener against Alabama on Sept. 5. \nAfter trying to practice through what was initially thought to be a sore groin, Clement gave more details to medical staff about his injury more than two weeks later. The team announced he would have surgery on Sept. 24. \nChryst said having the operation would take away any doubt of Clement aggravating the injury after returning. \n\"You know when it's time, they'll kind of let you know by the way they're running and their approach,\" Chryst said Thursday. \"He would not be cleared if he wasn't medically good.
