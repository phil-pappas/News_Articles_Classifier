Rauner.\nIn announcing that he wants the state to sell the Helmut Jahn-designed James R. Thompson Center in Chicago's Loop, the private-equity-investor-turned-governor all but endorsed its demolition. The building, he opined on Tuesday, is \"just not usable for much of anything.\"\nBut handing down a death sentence for Jahn's 30-year-old postmodern glitter palace is both premature and ill-informed. By viewing the building's future through the prism of a spreadsheet, the governor is ignoring the vital role it plays in the life of the Loop — and how renovation could transform it into a far more appealing civic hub than it is today.\nRenovation and repurposing, in short, should be considered before demolition.\nChicago is now the epicenter of the debate over how to handle troubled postmodern buildings. An Oct. 3 panel discussion at the Chicago Architecture Biennial labeled postmodernism \"preservation's new frontier.\" That discussion transcends the city's borders and offers alternatives to the governor's myopic vision.\nNext Wednesday, the City Council of Portland, Ore., will consider a plan to spend up to $195 million to renovate one of America's first major postmodern buildings — the Michael Graves-designed Portland Building, a 15-story municipal office building that opened in 1982, three years before the Thompson Center made its controversial debut as the State of Illinois Building.\nRauner wants Thompson Center auctioned off; sale would boost state, experts say Rick Pearson, Kim Janssen and Monique Garcia The James R. Thompson Center, architecturally significant to some and an emblem of bureaucratic government excess to others, would be sold and likely demolished to be rebuilt as a privately owned residential, office and retail space under a plan Gov. Bruce Rauner proposed Tuesday.\n\"From a pure...\nThe James R. Thompson Center, architecturally significant to some and an emblem of bureaucratic government excess to others, would be sold and likely demolished to be rebuilt as a privately owned residential, office and retail space under a plan Gov. Bruce Rauner proposed Tuesday.\n\"From a pure...\n(Rick Pearson, Kim Janssen and Monique Garcia) With its stylized garlands, abstracted keystones and a \"Portlandia\" statue, the Portland Building was in the vanguard of postmodernism. Ascendant in the 1980s, the style used bright colors, bold decoration and irony-laced versions of classical details to assault the modernist austerity of the steel-and-glass box. Yet form did not always serve function, particularly when construction budgets were tight.\nLike the Thompson Center, which infamously suffered from saunalike heat spikes, a leaky roof, and noise and smells that wafted up from the food court, the Portland Building is widely viewed as an awful place to work. Its tiny, tinted windows are especially irksome to its roughly 1,300 occupants. Last year, a story in The Oregonian newspaper of Portland called its interior \"dark, leaky and claustrophobic.\"\nAfter considering demolition, however, Portland officials are backing a proposal to gut and renovate the structure's interior. Aging mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems would be replaced. The controverisal exterior that won the building a spot on the National Register of Historic Places would be retained.\nPortland Building Harry Melchert / AP Renovation, not replacement of the Portland Building, shown in May 2006, is up for consideration before the Portland, Ore., City Council. Renovation, not replacement of the Portland Building, shown in May 2006, is up for consideration before the Portland, Ore., City Council. (Harry Melchert / AP) \"It's the cheapest alternative,\" Fred Miller, Portland's chief administrative officer, told me by phone.\nBesides being tens of millions of dollars less expensive than demolition and replacement, Miller said, the retrofit is expected to reduce energy bills and substantially increase the amount of natural light that filters into offices.\nIt's not hard to envision a comparable transformation of the 17-story Thompson Center, where Jahn fashioned a dramatic but flawed synthesis of the postmodern exuberance of the Portland Building and the high-tech aesthetic of Paris' Pompidou Center of 1977. But the benefits of a revamp would extend far beyond the building's workplaces.\nThe center's soaring, light-filled atrium, which was inspired by the domes of great public buildings and draws tourists and office workers by the thousands, is as vital a public space as Daley Plaza and the other outdoor piazzas of the Loop. More than 5.5 million passengers entered the center's Clark/Lake CTA station last year, making it the second-busiest station in the city.\nWe would all be better off if the center's tawdry glass walls (robin's egg blue and salmon — ugh!) were replaced with something that matched the built-for-the-ages dignity of neighboring government buildings, City Hall-County Building and the Daley Center.\nThe big question is whether a revamp makes economic sense — or the prospect of building at the greater density allowed by city zoning law will lure a buyer to demolish the center. The site's zoning allows for upward of 1.8 million square feet, a jump of nearly 60 percent over the current gross square footage, according to Jahn's office.\nIn a statement issued Tuesday, Jahn began to outline a response. He called for upgrading the building's shops and food court, marketing its large office floors to high-tech companies, and adding a hotel, apartments and condominiums. Architectural history \"is full of examples where such repurposing has brought new life to structures like this,\" he said.\nThe commercial success of his Sony Center in Berlin — a tent-topped, triangle-shaped wedge of offices, apartments, condominiums and entertainment attraction — lends credence to his vision. So does the assessment of Barbara Schenberg, an executive director with commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.\nPreserving the center would be \"a challenge,\" Schenberg told the Tribune's Kim Janssen, but developers \"can be very inventive putting space to use.\"\nEven though Jahn must share the blame for the center's woes — they're not solely due to deferred maintenance and repair, as he argues — I'd love to see him get another crack at the building. He's 75 now, an aging master rather than the brash wunderkind he was when former Gov. James Thompson commissioned him for the project.\nLife and architecture rarely give us second chances to correct (and improve upon) our early errors.\nThis could be one — but only if Rauner, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and prospective buyers consider the merits of reinventing postmodernism's star-crossed Chicago poster child.\nbkamin@tribpub.com\nTwitter @BlairKamin\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Helmut Jahn Chicago City Hall", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ece5b/turbine/ct-portland-building-jpg-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d3656/turbine/ct-thompson-center-bruce-rauner-20151013", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ece68/turbine/ct-thompson-center-kamin-met-1015-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:05:01.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
