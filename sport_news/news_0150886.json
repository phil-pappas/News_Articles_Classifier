In the postfight interview with HBO’s Max Kellerman, which was broadcast over the Garden’s public address system, Golovkin, a 33-year-old middleweight from Kazakhstan, memorably invoked a phrase that has defined his climb up the boxing ranks.\n“This is big drama show,” Golovkin said, smiling.\nThanks to the excitement generated by the Geale fight and three subsequent knockout wins, the big drama show is now taking place before a wider audience. Compared with a crowd of 8,572 who attended the Geale fight, Golovkin’s bout on Saturday against David Lemieux of Canada was announced as a sellout earlier in the week.\nGolovkin (33-0, 30 knockouts) had knocked out 20 consecutive opponents, 12 of them inside of three rounds, heading into Saturday’s fight. In the process, he won the World Boxing Association and International Boxing Organization championships, and was the No. 1 middleweight contender in the latest Ring magazine ranking.\n Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nUntil Saturday, Golovkin had been unable to get a highly respected opponent to challenge him. But Lemieux (34-2, 31 knockouts) was widely thought to be a significant upgrade in competition. Ranked the No. 4 middleweight contender by Ring magazine, Lemieux, 26, captured the International Boxing Federation championship in June when he defeated Hassan N’Dam of Cameroon.\n“This is the biggest test for me,” Golovkin said before the fight. “He’s the I.B.F. champ. It’s a big situation, unification.”\nGolovkin’s trainer, Abel Sanchez, disagreed with his fighter, citing Curtis Stevens — whom Golovkin defeated by an eighth-round technical knockout in November 2013 — as a more difficult foe. But then, Sanchez does not believe that anyone in Golovkin’s weight class can put a stop to the Kazakh fighter’s consecutive knockout streak.\n“I don’t think anybody at 160 pounds stays with Gennady for 12 rounds,” Sanchez said.\nLemieux was not intimated by Golovkin’s punching power, or the knockout streak.\n“I am aware of his record,” Lemieux said. “But I am also aware of who I am and what I can bring to the table.”\nSaturday’s card was seen by many in and around boxing as an opportunity for the sport to move beyond the Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao era. The May 2 showdown between those superstar welterweights was a hit at the box office, but the bout’s relative lack of action left many viewers disappointed.\nThe Hall of Fame boxer Oscar De La Hoya — the chairman and chief executive of Golden Boy Promotions, which promotes Lemieux — thinks Mayweather’s championship reign harmed the sport.\n“Boxing was a little dull there for a while, with Mayweather,” De La Hoya said. “With fights not being exciting, with matches being uneven. So we turn the page and look forward to the future.”\nEnter Gennady Golovkin’s big drama show. With Mayweather having announced his retirement, and Pacquiao winding down his career, Golovkin — thanks largely to his offensive style — has been pegged as a top contender to carry the torch for the sport.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n Tom Loeffler, the managing director of K2 Promotions, which promotes Golovkin, thinks it is incumbent upon fighters of Golovkin’s stature to try to fight in a crowd-pleasing style.\n“If a fan buys a ticket, or a fan buys a pay-per-view, he has to provide excitement for those people who are spending money to see him fight,” Loeffler said.\nNext month in Las Vegas, Saul Alvarez of Mexico is scheduled to take on Miguel Cotto of Puerto Rico in a middleweight championship bout. It is thought that the winner of that bout could meet Saturday night’s winner before long.\n“Right now, it’s a very interesting situation to be in in the middleweight division,” Golovkin said. “I think we have three or four fighters, and it’s very important who is No. 1.”\nDe La Hoya sees an eventual meeting between the winners as the only way to bring back fans who may have felt shortchanged by Mayweather vs. Pacquiao.\n“If you build it, they will come,” De La Hoya said, referring to the movie “Field of Dreams.” “If you put the best against the best, then you will slowly but surely build up boxing’s fan base.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:06:29.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
