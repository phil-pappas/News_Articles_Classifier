He turned around three ailing football teams — Duke, Florida and South Carolina — and is credited with ushering in a new era of a passing attack in the previously run-happy Southeastern Conference.\nHe is the winningest coach at two universities — Florida and South Carolina — and second only to the legendary Bear Bryant in the SEC. The 70-year-old Spurrier was known as much for his colorful quips as he was for his offensive genius. In a world rife with blandness (think Urban Meyer) at the top, the former Florida Gator quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner was a breath of fresh air who was always quick with a quip.\nAnd some of those jabs were aimed at Georgia, which made this year’s UGA 52-20 victory over the visor-throwing Gamecock coach all the more satisfying.\n“I don’t know. I sort of always liked playing them that second game because you could always count on them having two or three key players suspended.”\nAnd there was this one: “Why is it that during recruiting season they sign all the great players, but when it comes time to play the game, we have all the great players? I don’t understand that. What happens to them?”\nHe was especially harsh with Auburn. On a fire at the Auburn library that destroyed 20 books: “The real tragedy was that 15 hadn’t been colored yet.”\nEven during his resignation, Spurrier left the door open for his future.\n“I’m resigning. I’m not retiring,” Spurrier insisted. “I doubt I’ll ever be a head coach again but maybe coach at a high school team or something. Don’t say I’m retiring. Being on a team is fun. I may be a consultant or something.”\nWhatever the future holds for Spurrier, he’ll be missed by friends and foes alike.\nSpurrier as an offensive coordinator. That’s a strong maybe. But imagining this tempestuous leader as a high school coach will take some doing. And probably no small amount of dough, along with a high school stadium large enough to accommodate his immense ego.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:06:33.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
