Posted: Thursday, October 1, 2015 4:00 pm BMX racing a family affair By JIM FRANZ Sports editor beloitdailynews.com | 0 comments SOUTH BELOIT — Veteran BMX racer Bob Shockley admits he’s a nervous wreck on race day. It’s not when he takes to the track, with its high jumps and berm-edged turn. It’s his sons — 7-year-old Drew and 6-year-old Ben — who cause him all the worry. “I’m much more nervous before their races than mine,” Bob says with a chuckle as his wife, Amanda, nods. For the Shockleys as well as another South Beloit family, the Sympsons, BMX racing is definitely a family affair. They spend weekends at tracks near and far and plan vacations around competitions. Carolynn and Brian Sympson are the biggest fans of their son, Brady, 6, who routinely races in Rockford and other area tracks within a 100-mile radius. “All the tracks have new rider clinics,” Brian said. “The instructors work with the kids and give them an introduction to BMX. Brady benefited from those. Week to week, we could see him progress. We focused on (the Illinois) state series, this being his first year.” The Shockley boys, who both attend St. Peter’s School, have a little more experience. When Bob was 30, he started racing and took 3-year-old Drew to the track to practice with him. After all BMX, or bicycle motocross, is a sports in which family members can practice together and compete on the very same course, in sanctioned events in their own age groups. Ben got his start when he was 4 and is currently ranked sixth in the country in his age division. Both brothers already belong to a racing team. “It costs $50 to enter each event so having sponsors helps out,” Bob said. “There’s a lot of preparation, planning and practice that goes into a race that’s over in about 30 seconds. It can get expensive with the travel, but the boys have a lot of fun doing it and it’s a great sport. It’s real family-oriented.” All three boys competed in the BMX Nationals held at Searles Park in Rockford two weeks ago. Brady, a first grader at Clark Elementary School in South Beloit, had a great weekend. He won the state championship in his division. “That track is the best kept secret in Rockford,” his father said. “You almost have to be in (BMX) to know about it. But there were lots of people there that weekend. You could see license plates from every state in the parking lot. BMX racing has been around for 50 years. It was on the decline about 15 years ago, but it’s popularity is building again.” There are three divisions of competition in BMHS based on skill: novices, intermediate (after 10 wins) and expert (after 20 wins). Ben became an expert over the summer and the Shockley family will head to Orlando, Fla., to compete in nationals there in three weeks. The BMX season won’t end there. Before the first snowflakes, drivers have simply moved to indoor courses. “The season pretty much never ends,” Bob said. “It goes from Jan. 1 to Dec. 15. We go to Rockford BMX until around Halloween and then move to Elkhorn and race indoors. There’s also a 28-city national tour series that ends with the grand nationals in Tulsa. That decides the titles in each age group.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:04:38.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
