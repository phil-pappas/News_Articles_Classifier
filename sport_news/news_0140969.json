Alex Rodriguez is starting to come to life after a dreadful August, but Yankees manager Joe Girardi is still concerned about him. In fact, Girardi is worried that the 40-year-old DH might be fatigued.\nAdChoices “There are some concerns there of fatigue, of course,” manager Joe Girardi said Wednesday via NJ.com . “But we need him now.”\nA-Rod was given most of Sunday off, though he did get a hit in the game. He also had two hits including a home run in Wednesday’s game, indicating he may be bouncing back.\nBut the numbers in the second half of the season haven’t been pretty for A-Rod. After hitting .278 with 18 home runs and an .897 OPS in the first half, Rodriguez has hit .217 since the All-Star break. At least he’s picked up the power numbers by smacking 15 dingers.\nIf Girardi believes A-Rod fell off because of fatigue, that wouldn’t be unusual. Even Mike Trout, who is only 24, had a horrendous August. Perhaps that is just the time of the season when players burn out. The Yankees certainly are hoping so as they will need A-Rod’s bat in the postseason .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.nj.com/yankees/index.ssf/2015/09/yankees_joe_girardi_alex_rodriguez_struggles_a_con.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://larrybrownsports.com/baseball/ranking-mlb-postseason-sluggers/275988"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:45:51.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
