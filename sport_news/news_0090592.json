Once more the weekend football results are mixed for the Buckhorns and Warriors. For the third straight week, Wallenpaupack Area suffered a loss, driving its record now to 3-4, while Delaware Valley’s winning streak continues, boosting their tally to 5-2. Since the Scranton school district’s teachers’ strike ended earlier last week, the Knights and Invaders athletics programs were now allowed to continue. While DV was able to reap something from the strike, a win by forfeit versus West Scranton two weeks ago, Paupack’s hope of a similar win against Westside, was dashed when the Electric City schools went back into session last week. Road Woes Shyann Jackson’s 14-yard reception off Matt Gaul with 4:40 left in the first quarter got the Invaders on the board early, but the game was a scoreless stalemate through the middle of the fourth quarter. Somewhat unexpectedly, Buckhorns Head Coach Dr. Mark Watson elected to go with Isaiah Rios in the QB position. While Rios, a senior, is no stranger to taking the snaps, generally he’s more effective when catching passes than receiving them. The last time he stepped into this role in varsity game, was during his sophomore year when he made three attempts, landed none, and gave up an interception. Regular starter, junior Gavin Hiller, seemingly uninjured, stepped in on certain plays and did end up finishing the game for Paupack. The Bucks almost broke the shutout when James Gentes got the ball into the end zone but the touchdown voided due to a flag in the play and a penalty issued against Paupack. A second reception-TD combo by Gaul and Jackson put the Invaders up 14-0 with 8:28 left in the fourth. Then on a late drive, Donovan DePasquale picked off Hiller and took it back 76 yards to make it 19-0 with 1:53 left. The PAT kick was no good but it was a moot point. The Invaders took the win. Rios rushed for 25 yards on half-a-dozen tries and was 1-for-2 passing, hitting Ty Schmalzle for 8 yards. He grabbed a pair of receptions as well, good for 39. Rashawn Battle’s eight carries got him 39 yards while Mike Ingulli got 41 on 13 tries. Hiller did see some action. He was 2-for-11, gaining 39 yards but giving up two interceptions. Page 2 of 3 - “ I can’t say what went wrong until I look at the tapes,” Watson said. “After we figure out what we need to fix I hope we can regroup and salvage what we had going on.” Next up is North Pocono, who took another hit this past week in a close game with Scranton. It’s homecoming weekend for the Buckhorns and following that, they’ve only got one more game before they face off against Delaware Valley in the season closer. Homecoming The next day at DV, the Warriors hosted Valley View during an afternoon bout to celebrate homecoming weekend. Also on hand was the Pennsylvania National Guard, there to honor local veterans and recognize on-field leadership with trophies for game MVPs of each team as well as a Leadership Trophy for the winning team. Delaware Valley got on the board first thanks to a three-yard run by Ryan Obisi with 3:32 left in the first quarter, but Valley View’s Scot Wasilchak tied it up with just 10 seconds left in the quarter. Switching sides, DV was in possession and drove on to a 25 yard field goal by Josh Goulette with 7:25 left in the half. However, just 36 seconds before the halftime, Nick Pampalone picked off the Cougars pass and took it in 24 yards for another DV touchdown. The Warriors added to their 17-7 lead in the third quarter when Austin Cernek plowed through the Valley View defense to land a two-yard touchdown with 6:53 left in the quarter. Chandler Fuller connected with Evan Carey for a 23yd touchdown for the Cougars with 5:02 left, but blew the extra point kick and settled for just six, to make it a 24-13 game. Cernek would steamroll once more across the goal line at 6:28 in the fourth to make it 31-13, where it stayed until the game ended. Cernek was awarded the MVP trophy for his leadership and on-field efforts and the Warriors were presented with the team award trophy from the National Guard. DV’s mantra all season has been to improve week-by-week and become more consistent throughout the season. While the Warriors' aerial assault hasn’t improved the way Head Coach Keith Olsommer might wish it had, he is pleased with how some things are going. Page 3 of 3 - “ We’ve really picked up the running game,” Olsommer pointed out. “ We’re getting more and more kids involved in the plays each week too.” Next up for Delaware Valley: The Scranton Knights. A big game for DV, Olsommer noted, because it’s a Big-School rivalry and something they look forward to every year.
