Nor was it like 2008, when they did everything they could, beating every opponent, knowing they had no shot at No. 1.\nNowadays, Utah is in a far different place.\nA crowd of 47,798 showed up — second-largest in stadium history — for a pairing of undefeated teams. Utah’s Boobie Hobbs batted away a Cal pass with 26 seconds remaining to preserve a 30-24 win. But even if the Utes had lost, it wouldn’t have ruined the season.\nAs they say in the credit card commercials, membership has its privilege.\nThe best news is that the outcome didn’t necessarily leave either team out of the New Year’s bowl picture. In 2010, as a member of the MWC, Utah was ranked No. 5 when it lost to No. 3 TCU , afterward falling nine spots. A week later, after losing to Notre Dame, the Utes were 23rd.\nIf Utah loses two games this season, it still could end up playing in a New Year’s bowl, or even make the playoffs.\nSuch is the credit that comes with membership in you-know-what. Call it a valued customer rewards program.\nLast week Utah received its most first-place votes (seven) ever for a regular-season poll.\nDuring interviews with the media on Friday, ESPN personalities went so far as to say a two-loss Pac-12 team could make the playoffs.\n“So I think what you see now is the opportunity for more programs, (thanks to) conference realignment — which Utah navigated beautifully to become one of the big boys,” “GameDay” host Rece Davis said. “They (Utah) probably don’t have the resources and the money and the long-term history of Alabama and Ohio State and SC, but it doesn’t matter. They just have to win in 2015 and then show the commitment to be able to compete at that level now — and they’re doing so.”\nFive years after joining the Pac-12, the benefits have never been more apparent. New football and basketball facilities are up. Thirty-four consecutive games have sold out. And a single loss is only a traffic cone for a Pac-12 team.\n“The great thing about Utah now is they don’t have to worry about all that; don’t have to worry about years gone by when Urban (Meyer) was here, or the great team in 2008. They don’t have to worry about people trying to accept us,” Davis said, speaking on behalf of Utah. “We’re in the Pac-12. Just win the games — that’s all you really have to do. I’m not saying that necessarily guarantees you a (playoff) spot, because it depends on your record, but it certainly puts you in better stead than it would otherwise. You don’t have to prove that your schedule was the same as somebody else’s, you don’t have to prove you have the same test. You don’t because you’re in the Pac-12.”\nDavis’ colleague, David Pollack, was asked if a two-loss Pac-12 team could make the playoffs.\n“I don’t know, dude, where’s your lottery ticket?” he said. “What would be interesting is a one-loss ACC versus a two-loss Pac-12, or a two-loss SEC. It’s an interesting debate.”\nThrough much of Saturday it was hard to tell exactly where the Utes were headed. The halftime damages were many and deep, depending on perspective. Combined first-half stats: seven turnovers, 535 yards. There was something for everyone, both Cal and Utah fans: big-gain runs, long-gain passes, interceptions, a reverse pass attempt, recovered fumbles, sacks.\nAll that was missing was a shovel pass and a fumblerooski.\nUtah held a 27-24 after three quarters, 30-24 late in the game. The Ute defense harassed Cal quarterback Jared Goff into five interceptions.\nIt was as hotly contested as a game can be.\nBut as fierce as things got, it wasn’t life and death.\nIf ever there were a night for good karma, Saturday was it, though a case could be made that Utah used its quota at Oregon two weeks ago. Still, ESPN’s “GameDay” was in Salt Lake for the weekend and there was nothing but blue skies and warm temperatures. The Utes arrived in throwback uniforms, which, if you saw their teams in the 1970s, wasn’t necessarily a good thing.\nBut this isn’t the ‘70s. Or even 2008.\nUnlike their MWC days, their destiny remains in their own hands.\nEmail: rock@desnews.com ; Twitter: @therockmonster; Blog: Rockmonster Unplugged", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:23:51.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
