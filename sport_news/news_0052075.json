Afternoons will be in the upper 70s and overnight lows will drop into the 50s and 60s.\nWinds will remain breezy through Sunday. The upper pattern begins to shift with an upper ridge developing from the west over the region.\nThis will warm temperatures back into the mid and even upper 80s by next week. Hurricane Joaquin is now on a projected path away from the US East coast and should remain over the Atlantic as it moves northward.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
