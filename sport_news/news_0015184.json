He also added an empty-netter in the waning minutes of the game to record his sixth career hat trick. \n\"Just credit all the zone time we had tonight,\" Spezza said. \"I thought I had the puck a lot tonight. Some nights it follows you a little more.\" \nDallas was lifted by a late first period goal by Spezza after he squeaked the puck in between the left post and Edmonton goalie Anders Nilsson's skate. The puck bounced off the skate and into the net to give Dallas a 1-0 lead entering the first intermission. \nThe Stars doubled their advantage just two minutes into the second frame, when Jamie Benn circled around the back of the Edmonton net and guided the puck past Nilsson. Jyrki Jokipakka and John Klingberg assisted on the play. \nIt did not take the Oilers long to capture some momentum of their own, as defenseman Oscar Klefbom fired a shot at the edge of the Dallas third. The shot grazed off Dallas defenseman Vernon Fiddler's glove and past Kari Lehtonen, who was in position to stop the original path of the puck. \nLess than two minutes later, Edmonton knotted the score up at two apiece after defenseman Andrej Sekera fired from a similar spot as Klefbom. The Oilers again got a fortunate deflection, this time off the stick of 2015 first overall pick Connor McDavid, which left Lehtonen on his heels and unable to judge the direction of the puck. The goal was the first of McDavid's young NHL career. \n\"There's nothing you can do about those first two goals,\" said head coach Lindy Ruff. \"The hockey gods were looking the other way and decided to give Edmonton a couple of deflections, and that happens.\" \nCody Eakin, Tyler Seguin and Jason Demers all had 1v1 opportunities in the third period to give Dallas the advantage, but Nilsson was able to save each of their attempt and keep the score deadlocked. Patrick Sharp also appeared to have given Dallas a lead, but a non-call on a goal was upheld after review due to the play being blown dead prior to the puck crossing the line. \nThe game turned after Lethtonen, who made his first start of the season, made a heads-up save a quarter way through the final frame. After the save, the Stars responded on the counter, which allowed Spezza to drill the puck past Nilsson to give Dallas the elusive 3-2 lead. \n\"The second goal felt good because we were coming to get the lead back. And that felt good,\" Spezza said. \"I thought we had a good game, and we stuck with it and were rewarded in the end.\" \nAfter a troublesome third period against Colorado in their previous game, Dallas rebounded on both ends of the ice. The Stars outshot Edmonton 52-28, a sign of both improved defense down the stretch and a more aggressive attack on the offensive end. \n\"We had some big numbers,\" Ruff said. \"I really believe if you get numbers close to that, those guys are going to put it in the back of the net.\" \nDallas was left with one sour taste in their mouth despite the win. Patrick Eaves was diagnosed with a lower body injury that Ruff assessed as something that will be more than just day to day, indicating he could miss significant time this season. \nThe Stars are now 2-1 and hit the road to take on the Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday, Oct. 15 at 6:30 p.m. Read or Share this story: http://on.wfaa.com/1LtlbTF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:41:44.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
