There’s the $15,719,062 he’ll make from the Rockets this season. There’s the $16,744,218 he’ll make next season. And there’s the $17,769,374 he’ll make the season after that before becoming a free agent. Oh yeah, and then there’s that $200 million adidas deal he signed back in August .

Because when you’re raking in the kind of money Harden is right now, who has time to count it all?!\nThe only thing Torre doesn’t mention Harden having?
