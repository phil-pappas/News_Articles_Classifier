Yesterday and probably the day before he complained of pain in his foot. \n\"Yesterday he bowled pretty well in the nets and got through it, but it's obviously got worse overnight. \nIt's a bitter blow for him. He bowled really well in that warm-up, and he's made huge strides in the past 12 months back towards where we want him to be. We'll monitor him, and hopefully he could be fit for the second Test.\" \nPakistan have problems of their own after leg-spinner Yasir Shah limped away from a net session on Monday with what appeared to be a back injury. \nShah has taken 61 wickets in 10 Tests and is widely seen as his side's biggest bowling threat on the traditionally sluggish pitches in the United Arab Emirates. \nPakistan captain Misbah ul-Haq told a press conference a decision on Shah's fitness would be made on the morning of the Test. \nCook said: \"Of course it'd be a loss for them, but as always the day before a big series we're concentrating on matters important to us. When we get the team sheet at 9.30 in the morning we'll see whether he's playing. \n\"He's clearly a fantastic bowler who not many of us have faced in Test or four-day cricket, and he's obviously had a good start to his Test career.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:07:32.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
