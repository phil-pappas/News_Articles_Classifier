(Matt Smith | For lehighvalleylive.com) By Brad Wilson | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 01, 2015 1:41 PM \nNorthwestern Lehigh (3-1) at Saucon Valley (4-0), Friday, 7 p.m. \nA little revenge. The Panthers’ sole Colonial League defeat of 2014 came at Northwestern last year when the Tigers handed their visitors a stinging 39-14 loss. “We have a lot of motivation to avenge that loss,” Saucon Valley senior quarterback Zach Thatcher said. In particular, Saucon Valley remembers something that was said that they didn’t like. “(Northwestern standout running back) Harry Hall said in the newspapers that they “broke us” on and off the field,” Panther senior linebacker and fullback Mike Paolini said. “That embarrassed us. That quote is definitely for us to want to beat them this year.” \nLess laundry. Saucon Valley was flagged six times for 88 yards in last week’s 55-13 win at Catasauqua, and any kind of repeat against Northwestern Lehigh will be a serious time. “I think that was a one-time issue,” Saucon Valley coach Matt Evancho said. “It was getting a little chippy, and we asked the referees to call it tight even if it was our guys getting the penalties. We spoke to the kids about it, they understand, and we’ve moved on from it. I don’t think it will be an issue this week.” Northwestern also needs to cut down on flags; the Tigers piled up 108 yards in penalties last week. \nDylan Snyder’s progress. Northwestern’s senior quarterback started his first game just four weeks ago, and he struggled a bit fitting into the position. But he’s made considerable improvement since, as was shown in last week’s win over Wilson when he completed 8 of 12 passes for 74 yards and a touchdown. With Hall around, Snyder doesn’t have to throw 25 passes a game for the Tigers to be successful, but his passing adds an element to the defensive puzzle for Saucon Valley to solve. “The big thing with Dylan is that he’s getting game experience,” Northwestern Lehigh coach Josh Snyder said. “He broke both his wrists in the offseason and had pins put in, and we didn’t know if we’d have him. He didn’t get a lot of snaps in the offseason. He’s making good decisions, and Dylan Lobach’s improvement at tight end has helped; he’s caught touchdown passes in the last three games.” And there’s also then impact of … \nDylan Snyder as a runner. Snyder averaged almost 10 yards a carry against Wilson on nine runs, and he adds a different dimension to the Tiger attack. “We want him run the ball a little more and pressure the edge on the option,” Snyder said. Evancho agreed. “I see things from him I didn’t need to see on film,” the Panther coach laughed. “He’s more involved in the running game, and when we’re covering pass plays we have to make sure we don’t let his (running) lanes open or he’ll take off. He’s not afraid to take off and run and he converted a long fourth down and long third down against Wilson.” \nWho makes for better ducks. The forecast is for “periods of rain” Friday night. Both coaches made the point that both teams have to play in the rain so they did not see it having a huge impact. “Both teams have a downhill running game,” Snyder said. “If one of us threw it 40 times a game it might make a difference.” But where the weather might factor in is who wants to play in the rain, who likes it, and can turn that to their advantage. Count Paolini in. “I haven’t played in a rain game since youth football,” he said “I’d love it. I’d like to roll around out there and get dirty.” And as Thatcher said. “I’d rather play in a rainstorm than the freezing cold.” \nThe game’s on the line. With running backs such as Hall (613 yards, 7.5 yards per carry) on one side and Saucon’s Evan Culver (760 yards, 8.2 yards per carry) there’s no question that whichever line can dominate its opponent will very likely be successful. “I think Northwestern is very physical, like Northern Lehigh, they like to punch you in the face,” Thatcher said. “If you don’t respond, like we did against Northern Lehigh, then we’ll be in a dogfight.” Evancho was emphatic. “We have to control the line of scrimmage.” If not, Northwestern will have a big day. \nIntangibles of interest. There’s more than usual off-field matters to do deal with. There’s the horrible tragedy of Evan Murray’s death; the Panthers were familiar with the Warren Hills quarterback from summer passing leagues, and Evancho said they will be honoring both Murray and the late Fritz Halfacre, Saucon Valley’s first football coach, before the game. There’s the weather. There’s Hall’s quotes from last year, and the Panthers’ intense desire to erase 39-14 from their memory. There’s playoff implications; as Snyder noted, especially for his team with one loss, “every game is a big game because when you look at the playoff picture it looks like some good teams are going to be heartbroken at the end.” And there’s Saucon Valley’s moxie. “We like playing in big games, we love them,” said senior defensive end/tight end Mike Kane after his team’s defeat of Southern Lehigh two weeks ago. Friday is definitely a big one – for both teams. “I am comfortable with where we are at coming in,” Snyder said. “I like our confidence level. Our kids are ready.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:34:31.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
