He's also running to the tune of an 8.0 yards-per-carry average.\nUpdated Odds To Win The 2015 Heisman Trophy 10/20: https://t.co/92yfnq1fzI pic.twitter.com/JlWjGWp8vf\n— TigerDroppings.com (@TigerDroppings) October 20, 2015 Should Fournette stay on this pace of averaging 200.33 yards per contest, he'd finish the year with 2,203 yards rushing. It'd place him fifth all-time in most rushing yards for a single season (behind Barry Sanders, Melvin Gordon, Kevin Smith, and Marcus Allen, respectively).\nFournette could theoretically could still feature in a conference title game, and (potentially) multiple playoff contests.\nHe's truly in the midst of a historic season.\nAdChoices Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LSUBonnette/status/656250822087479296", "https://twitter.com/TigerDroppings/status/656491891609894912", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "https://t.co/JlWjGWp8vf", "https://t.co/92yfnq1fzI", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/LSUfball"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:51:59.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
