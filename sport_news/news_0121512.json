The boy, whom authorities identified as Eian Santiago, was at a residence at about 9:05 p.m. in the 1000 block of North Francisco Avenue in the Humboldt Park neighborhood on the West Side when his 6-year-old brother got hold of a revolver and shot him in the head. According to Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, the two had been playing \"cops and robbers\" when the 6-year-old saw the handgun atop a refrigerator, took it and fired it in the direction of his brother. Guglielmi could not further describe the weapon other than saying it was a handgun. The boys' father, 25-year-old Michael Santiago, was charged with felony child endangerment in connection with the shooting . He kept a loaded gun on top of a refrigerator, according to police. He is expected to appear in bond court Sunday. Guglielmi said that Michael Santiago told police he was a former member of the Spanish Cobras gang and that he had purchased the gun from another gang member for protection. Guglielmi said police are in the process of tracing the weapon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:23:05.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
