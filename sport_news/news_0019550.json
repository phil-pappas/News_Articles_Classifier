So we'll play it as hard as we can physically but certainly as fair as we can.\n\"If teams are going to start doing that then you've got to adapt as quickly as you can.\"\nFellow loose forward Jerome Kaino was pleased that with the use of immediate video replays, referees have been able to clamp down on violence, which he said was not part of the All Blacks armoury.\n\"We don't go into a game thinking about that kind of stuff,\" he said.\n\"Our sole focus has been to get our game going and we've seen the trend of referees how they've been in this World Cup and you don't want to be on that side of the referees where you get carded and cost your team.\n\"We want to be clean. Play hard but fair but we don't want that kind of stuff.\"\nHowever, lock Luke Romano indicated a totally clean game could not be guaranteed in such a high-stakes match.\n\"Every team is going out there to win and every team will do everything they can to win. It's a quarter-final at the Rugby World Cup. If you lose you go home.\n\"The French will throw everything at us and we will throw everything back at them.\"\nThe most notorious incident in All Blacks-France rugby rivalry came in 1986 in the game now known as the \"Battle of Nantes\".\nTwenty minutes into the game, All Blacks skipper Wayne \"Buck\" Shelford had his scrotum ripped open and four teeth knocked out.\nIncredibly, Shelford had the injury stitched on the sideline and carried on playing until he was concussed by a blow to the head and could not carry on.\nSeveral years later investigative journalist Pierre Ballester claimed in a book that the French players were on amphetamines at the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:47:43.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
