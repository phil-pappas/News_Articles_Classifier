(AP) - A state fire investigator has testified that a woman arrested on an arson charge was seen putting gas in a container at a gas station, lighting a cigarette and entering an apartment building that was the site of a fire.\nHowever, Adam Fanjoy testified Monday the fire was still under investigation. He said he could not give an exact cause, but that it was incendiary.\nAmber Cowan of Franklin was charged with arson earlier this month. She had been living in one of the apartments and was evicted. The 28-year-old Cowan remains jailed on $500,000 cash bail.\nCowan's attorney, Melinda Siranian, said some of the witness accounts are contradictory. She asked Judge Edward Gordon to find insufficient probable cause to support the arson charge and dismiss it. Gordon disagreed.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:34:22.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
