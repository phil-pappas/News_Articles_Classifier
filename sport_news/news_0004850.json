Couture will travel to San Jose for surgery and miss four to six weeks. \nHis loss is significant for the Sharks, who are 3-0-0 under new coach Peter DeBoer. Couture had one assist through three games while centering the second line between Patrick Marleau and Joel Ward. \nCouture is the second Sharks forward to be gone for substantial time this season. Raffi Torres was suspended 41 games for an illegal hit in preseason. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:52:47.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
