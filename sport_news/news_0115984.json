After running wide to gift Hamilton the lead, Rosberg was soon heading for the pits and a costly retirement. \nSecond place for Sebastian Vettel means the Ferrari driver is now Hamilton's closest title challenger, 66 points behind, but the mathematics are now simple - if Hamilton wins the next race in America and Vettel finishes no better than third then the Mercedes driver will achieve his dream of becoming a three-time world champion. \nRosberg is now 73 points off the pace with just 100 left to play for over the final four races. Hamilton said in the post-race press conference: \"Nico's been incredibly unfortunate to suffer the worst of it.\" \nRosberg's DNF wasn't enough, however, to delay Mercedes' coronation as winners of the Constructors' Championship for a second successive year - although the Brackley squad had to wait for Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen to be penalised in a post-race investigation before their celebrations could begin. \nWhile Rosberg's early demise in Sochi cleared Hamilton's path to a comfortable ninth win of his dominant season and 42nd of his career, tying Vettel for third on the all-time list, the battle for the remaining podium positions was rather more riveting - and unpredictable. \nWhile Vettel, having fallen behind teammate Raikkonen at the start, worked his way up to second, the battle for third went all the way down to the final lap as the second Ferrari and Williams' Valtteri Bottas fast caught Force India's Sergio Perez, who had made an early opportunistic pitstop under the Safety Car called for a huge crash for Romain Grosjean. \nThe not inconsiderable challenge for Perez was to complete the final 40 laps on the same set of soft tyres. It looked as though the Mexican had just fallen agonisingly short of the podium when Bottas and Raikkonen passed him in quick succession at the end of the penultimate lap. \nHowever, there was one dramatic twist left in the tail on the final tour. Steaming into the braking zone at Turn Four, Raikkonen hit the side of the Williams to send countryman Bottas into a collision course with the barriers. \nWith Raikkonen's SF15-T also sustaining severe damage, Perez gleefully seized third place back - claiming his and Force India's first podium finish since last year's Bahrain GP. \n\"It worked really well,\" said Perez of Force India's bold strategy. \"We lost the podium one lap before the end, but it was very difficult to hold them back. I could not brake, I was in danger of flat spotting them [the tyres]. Then in the last lap they had the contact. It's great to give a second podium to the team and give them more momentum.\" \nRaikkonen, overtaken by the other Williams of Felipe Massa for fourth, managed to drag his car with sparks flying from its underside over the line in fifth place, but the Finn's tangle with Bottas unsurprisingly caught the eye of the stewards. \nTwo hours after the end of the race, the veteran was handed a 30-second time penalty which dropped him to eighth in the classification - confirming Mercedes as constructors' champions.
