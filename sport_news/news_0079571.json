It was a shame for the team to lose one of the cars,” Hamilton said. \n“I don’t take what we have granted.” \nVettel added: “I thought there was a slight chance to catch Lewis at one point, but he had so much pace in hand.” \nDespite his ill luck, Rosberg refused to concede the title. \n“Formula One is pretty incredible sometimes, how tough it is,” he said. \n“I am never going to win a championship like that when normal things break on a day when I should have won the race, but I will come back, as I always do.” \nIn a race with two Safety Car interventions, several accidents and a series of retirements, Spaniard Carlos Sainz who had crashed heavily in his Toro Rosso on Saturday, was passed fit to start from the back of the grid, rose to 10th and retired after spinning off in the closing laps. \nAn opening lap multi-car collision caused the first Safety Car. The second came after 12 laps when Romain Grosjean crashed heavily in his Lotus and climbed out of the wreckage unhurt. \nAnother crash on the final lap, involving Finns Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari and Valtteri Bottas of Williams as they battled for third gave the position instead to Sergio Perez. \nFelipe Massa secured some compensation for Williams by finishing fourth ahead of Raikkonen, local hero Russian Daniil Kvyat of Red Bull and Felipe Nasr of Sauber. \nAustralia’s Daniel Ricciardo, for Red Bull, finished 15th.
