Patterson) \nFlorida’s return to national prominence this season suffered a rather big jolt with the news breaking out of Gainesville on Monday. Florida will announce this afternoon that QB Will Grier has been suspended for the rest of the season for a violation of NCAA rules. \n— Mike Huguenin (@MikeHuguenin) October 12, 2015 \nMultiple reports say Grier could be suspended for more than just the rest of this season. Grier's suspension expected to last 1 year from today, but lawyers are involved in appeals process. Could be rest of season, longer. #Gators \n— Mark Long (@APMarkLong) October 12, 2015 Source tells @FoxSports #UF QB Will Grier is suspended for AT LEAST rest of the season for testing positive for a banned substance. \n— Bruce Feldman (@BruceFeldmanCFB) October 12, 2015 \nThe suspension apparently is related to performance-enhancing drugs. According to sources, #Gators QB Will Grier took the banned supplement Ligandrol. \n— Jesse Re Simonton (@JesseReSimonton) October 12, 2015 Florida QB Will Grier suspended for season for testing positive for performance enhancing drugs, source told @ESPN \n— Brett McMurphy (@McMurphyESPN) October 12, 2015 SOURCE: Will Grier took something over the counter that he did not get approved from Florida trainers. \n— Derek Tyson (@DerekTysonESPN) October 12, 2015 \nGrier, a redshirt freshman for the No. 8 Gators, completed 106 of 161 passes for 1,204 yards and 10 touchdowns this season, with just three interceptions. He also has scored two rushing touchdowns. \nSophomore Treon Harris, who started the season opener before losing the job to Grier, will get the start with Grier suspended. Harris also has had his share of trouble this season, as he was suspended the Tennessee game on Sept. 26. \nThe undefeated Gators travel to Death Valley to play No. 6 LSU on Saturday night. Florida is the only undefeated team in the SEC East. \nAccording to NCAA rules , a first PED offense results in a full-season suspension (25 percent of a student-athlete’s total eligibility). A second offense results in permanent ineligibility. After spending the first 17 years of his Post career writing and editing, Matt and the printed paper had an amicable divorce in 2014.
