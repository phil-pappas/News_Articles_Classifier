Players pay an entry fee to compete for cash prizes in games involving college or professional sports. \nCompanies such as Boston-based DraftKings and New York-based FanDuel contend their sites aren’t gambling, are legal and were exempted in 2006 from a federal online gambling ban. \nHealey said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press she’s focusing on consumers, particularly youngsters and those with gambling addiction. \nThe Massachusetts Gaming Commission, which oversees casino gambling and horse racing, also is reviewing the legality of the sites.
