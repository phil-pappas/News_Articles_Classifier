Here's a little experiment you can do at home that should help answer the question. \nLine up some friends for flag football. Take the ball in the shotgun with no blockers. Tell the pass rushers they can count to Two-Mississippi. If they haven't sacked you by the time they spit out that last \"I,\" then they're too late. \nYou won't get touched all afternoon. \nNow imagine Brady in the shotgun with about 1,500 pounds of blockers protecting him. The two-second rule still applies, except Brady's targets aren't uncle Clarence or cousin Vicky, but Rob Gronkowski , Julian Edelman , and Dion Lewis. \nThe famed 46 Defense of the 1985 Chicago Bears wouldn't have gotten a sniff of him. Neither would the Steel Curtain, the Purple People Eaters, or any other defense worthy of a name. We know we can add the Legion of Boom to the list, because Brady carved them up like Bobby Flay in the Super Bowl . \nWith the Patriots transforming the short passing game into an unstoppable art form, suddenly Brady's goal of excelling well into his 40s doesn't seem farfetched. \nIf he never gets hit, he's never going to get hurt. And if he never gets hurt, he might never stop playing. \n*** \nJackie Bradley is the best defensive outfielder I've ever laid eyes on. People who saw Willie Mays are starting to reach the same conclusion, including WEEI's very own Joe Castiglione, whose institutional memory eclipses just about anyone with the Red Sox . \nBut offensively, some sobering facts are in order. Let's break Bradley's career into three chunks. \nFrom his debut in 2013 through Aug. 8 of this season, Bradley hit .188 with an OPS around .500. He struck out 170 times in only 550 plate appearances. \nFrom Aug. 9 through Sept. 7, a span of 25 games, Bradley pulled on his Ted Williams jersey and hit .446 with a 1.441 OPS. He mashed seven homers, more than doubling his prior career total of five. \nFrom Sept. 8 through Thursday night's 0-for-3 against the Yankees , Bradley has hit .127 (9-for-71). \nSo to recap: For two-plus years, he hit .188. For less than a month, he hit .446. In the month since, he has batted .127. \nThe statistically inclined like to talk about sample sizes. In Bradley's case, what sample carries more weight: the one comprising 10 percent of his career, or the one accounting for 90? \nAnd yet we're still banking on Bradley being the everyday center fielder next season. The Red Sox will have to think long and hard before entering spring training with Bradley and Rusney Castillo (.202 over the last month) penciled in as their starting outfielders. \nJust add it to Dave Dombrowski's list. \n*** \nQuestion for the non-hardcore Bruins fan: If I remove Tuuka Rask, Zedeno Chara, and Patrice Bergeron from consideration, can you name five members of the team? Back up -- did you even notice that I spelled \"Tuukka\" and \"Zdeno\" wrong? \nWhen the Bruins won it all in 2011 and fell a minute shy of forcing a Game 7 in 2013, it felt like they'd contend well into this decade. Instead, they made a disastrous trade of Tyler Seguin , watched their young core ( Brad Marchand , Milan Lucic , David Krejci ) collectively regress, and now they're starting over with a bunch of people the average sports fan couldn't name. \n*** \nCeltics fans will be scoreboard watching all season not to chart their own progress, but that of the Nets . \nThe Celtics own Brooklyn's first round pick, and it's unprotected. That means if the Nets finish with the worst record in basketball, the Celtics will pick No. 1 overall and get a shot at whichever freshman takes the nation by storm. (I'm not even going to pretend to know who that is, because I find the entire concept of college basketball kinda dirty.) \nIn any event, the Nets are in disarray, with Joe Johnson and max-contract big man Brook Lopez their two stars, such as it were, and Vegas setting their over-under at a paltry 28.5 wins. (The Celtics, by comparison, are at 42.5). Twenty-eight wins would've earned the No. 6 pick in last year's draft. The cutoff for the top five is usually 25. \nThe Nets could easily end up there, at which point you just put your trust in the Celtics' scouting staff, which has drafted well over the years. \n\"You really have to hang onto even the smallest of percentages of picks that could turn into a transcendent player, because transcendent players are so hard to find and acquire,\" C's boss Danny Ainge said recently. \nHe didn't mention the Brooklyn pick explicitly, but he didn't have to. \n*** \nThe Pirates beat the slumping Nationals, 4-2, on July 24, 2013. What makes that game memorable? Absolutely nothing, unless you're a Pedro Alvarez fan (he homered in the 1st). What's illustrative, however, was the attendance at Nationals Park : 33,636. That happens to be the exact number of Americans killed by guns that year, the most recent with reliable data, according to the Centers for Disease Control. \nImagine a baseball park packed with fans. Now imagine all of them being gunned down in their seats. Our JV squad of mass shooters could handle the task. Welcome to America. \nOne of these years, we're going to shoot enough people to fill a football stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:50:40.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
