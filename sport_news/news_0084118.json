And they want to be in position to reap those benefits as Henson continues to develop with the up-and-coming Bucks. \nMilwaukee and Henson agreed Friday to a four-year, $44 million contract that could reach $48 million if certain incentives are reached, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because an official announcement has not been made. \nHenson was the 14th overall pick out of North Carolina in 2012. Picking in the middle of the first round can be an incredibly difficult position to be in, but Bucks GM John Hammond has hit on several of his choices, including Giannis Antetokounmpo and Henson, a 6-foot-11 power forward/center with the ability to guard multiple positions. \nIn his third season in the league, Henson averaged 7.0 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in 18 minutes per game. But he also shot 56 percent from the field and saw his playing time increase in the playoffs as coach Jason Kidd grew to rely more on him to bring some defensive tenacity to a surprisingly successful team. \nWith the salary cap set to skyrocket in the coming years as the NBA’s new television deal kicks in, the Bucks didn’t hesitate to lock up Henson in a financial environment that has been especially lucrative for big men. The deal, which was first reported by ESPN, ensures that Henson will remain a core member of a young team on the rise as he enters his fourth NBA season. \nHenson joins Antetokounmpo, Michael Carter-Williams, Khris Middleton and Jabari Parker as youngsters supplemented by veterans like Greg Monroe, Jerryd Bayless and Greivis Vasquez on a team expected to make another playoff run in the Eastern Conference. \nEnergized by new owners Wesley Edens and Marc Lasry, the Bucks have been aggressive on the market. In addition to Henson’s deal, Middleton signed a five-year, $70 million contract this summer and Monroe got three years and $51 million to give them the offensive presence in the paint they have been missing.
