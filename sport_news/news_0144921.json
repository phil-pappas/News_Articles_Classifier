Lin shot a bogey-free round. Lin is a six-time Asian Tour winner but unheralded Hung turned professional two years ago. \n\nJoshi shared the third spot with Miguel Tabuena of the Philippines, who finished second last year, Shaun Norris of South Africa, Panuphol Pittayarat of Thailand and Chinese Taipei duo Hung Chien-yao and veteran Lu Wen-teh. \n\nGaganjeet Bhullar, on a comeback trail, began well with a three-under 69 in the tied ninth place, while Angad Cheema shot 71 to be tied 32nd. Among other Indians S Chikka, Rashid Khan and Shubhankar Sharma shot 73 each to be tied 65th, while Himmat Rai and Rahil Gangjee carded 74 each to be 86 and Chiragh Kumar was further behind with 75 in the 108th place. \n\nBhullar, a five-time winner on the Asian Tour, said, \"I'm happy with the way I'm playing. I missed a lot of short putts but it is still early because it is only the first day. I had a good finish to the round with two birdies. I've been striking the ball really well in the past three weeks so I hope to continue.\" \n\nDefending champion Prom Meesawat of Thailand opened his campaign with a solid 70 to trail the leaders by three shots at the Linkou International Golf and Country Club. \n\nLin's decision to focus on his health and fitness earlier this year is starting to pay-off as he fired five birdies in the calm morning conditions to be in the hunt for a first victory in 2015.
