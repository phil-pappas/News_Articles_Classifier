The Jets have lost seven of their last eight games against New England since their stunning upset of the Patriots in the 2010 AFC playoffs. This will be first-year coach Todd Bowles’ first game in this rivalry.\nIn the spotlight \nJets QB Ryan Fitzpatrick. The veteran signal-caller is coming off a game in which he achieved his highest passer rating this season, a 113.1 mark in a victory over Washington. Fitzpatrick has been a steady and effective game manager for the Jets during their fast start, but he likely will have to be more than that if the Jets are to keep up with New England QB Tom Brady and his high-flying offense. The Patriots are averaging 36.6 points.\nGame plan \nThe Jets lead the league in rushing offense thanks to blossoming star Chris Ivory and an efficient offensive line. They will need to take advantage of a New England defense that has been gouged for 4.8 yards per carry. That strategy could set up favorable passing situations for Fitzpatrick against a somewhat suspect New England secondary. The defense needs to rattle Brady and make him uncomfortable in the pocket, or he will pick apart the defense. \n— J.P.
