Rogers suffered another torn labrum in his throwing arm and underwent surgery that ended his baseball career, according to the lawsuit. \nThe suit claims Smith discouraged players from complaining about soreness or physical limitations and discouraged them from sitting out of scheduled activities. \nSmith, originally named as a defendant, was dismissed from the lawsuit by a magistrate’s ruling that said only state agencies and instrumentalities can be defendants in original suits in the Ohio Court of Claims. \nA message left Thursday for Smith at the university was not immediately returned. \n___ \nInformation from: The Athens Messenger, http://www.athensmessenger.com/ Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:29:22.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
