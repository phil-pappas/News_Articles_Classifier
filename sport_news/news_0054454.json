The Mavericks entered the game 0-5 with two wins in their past 23 games, and they hadn’t beaten Howell since 2006. \nAlthough it was viewed as likely that the Highlanders would emerge victorious, which they did in a 31-14 win on homecoming, Howell coach Aaron Metz wanted to see more than his team going through the motions in the contest. \nMetz wanted to see a bounce-back performance to erase the memory of the Week 4 loss. \nIt took a while, but he was eventually satisfied. \n“I think we responded well by the end of the night. But I think we came out a little slow,” said Metz, whose team trailed Milford before rallying to lead at halftime, 17-14. \n“We made some mistakes but I think we matured a little bit tonight.” \n“I think we might have overlooked them,” running back Joey Gossett said on the reason for the slow start. “We were just looking towards next week.” \nThe Highlanders appeared like they would start off fast. \nOn the second play from scrimmage they recovered a fumble that put them on the Milford 13, and a few plays later quarterback Ryan Brennan punched the ball in from the Mavericks 1. \nFrom there, however, things would progress slowly. \nHowell seemingly wanted to control the ball and the clock, calling mostly run plays early on, and relying on its defense when the offense failed to move the chains. Milford, which entered the night allowing the most points per game (39.2) of any team in the KLAA West, saw to it that Howell’s defense was in the game a lot. \nFor an 0-5 team giving up nearly 40 points to opponents and averaging less than 10 points (9.6) on offense, it didn’t play that way. After Brennan’s score, which was basically a gimme to the Highlanders, the Mavericks took over. \nHowell’s Thomas Lassitter carries the ball against Milford in a game the Highlanders won, 31-14, on Friday night.

Considering Pinckney’s sophomore quarterback Brandon Leach posted 350 passing yards on the Highlanders, it wouldn’t be far-fetched to call defending the pass a team weakness thus far. That weakness popped up early. \nTwo long passes from Milford’s QB put the Mavericks on the goal-line twice in the second quarter. They would capitalize on both occasions with 1-yard rushes by Connor Jensen. The second of Jensen’s two TDs gave Milford its first lead of 2015. \n“Give Milford credit,” Metz said. “They run a good, nice scheme and they have some good players. Their kids are battling and they want to get a win. Those kids were fighting hard in the beginning and I think we were feeling them out.” \nBut in the second half, the Highlanders took control. \nIt was Gossett who got things clicking for the offense. The junior running back, who broke off a few long runs in the first, found the end zone twice, once from 4 yards out and another from 1 to give Howell a 24-14 lead. \n“We came out pretty slow, but we came out of halftime knowing we had to get it done,” said Gossett, who gave all the credit to his linemen. “We’re gonna be ready for that division championship next week.” \nWith Grand Blanc falling to Pinckney and Brighton losing to Hartland, the Highlanders will be squaring off against the Bulldogs for the West title. Howell owns the tiebreaker over the Eagles, so with a win over Brighton, they could lock a berth in the Lakes Conference championship game. \n“That might be the biggest game of my career,” said Gossett, already looking forward to it. 24 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ldpaa.com/1RlFL9n TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:13:40.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
