It was the second time in six weeks that the 5A, 4A, 3A, 2A and 1A runners traversed the course, and most saw significant improvements in their times. \nTake Katherine Ruck of Moscow, who broke through to win the State 4A championship last year. \nRuck cruised to victory Thursday, winning the Region I title in a time of 18 minutes, 2 seconds – a 45-second improvement from her winning time Sept. 12 in the Timberlake Farragut Invitational. \n“I was hoping it would be under 18,” said Ruck, who is heavily favored to repeat Oct. 31 at state. \nSophomore Katherine Kaul of Sandpoint may have been a distant runner-up (19:47), but she shaved 31 seconds from last month. \nSandpoint, which will seek a third consecutive state title, easily won the regional title with 20 points. Moscow, also a state qualifier, was second (53) and Lakeland (62) third. \nThe Bulldogs’ five scorers all finished within 53 seconds of each other. \n“That was a breakout race for her this season,” Sandpoint coach Angie Brass said of Kaul, who missed track last year with a fracture in her hip. “She’s had some stuff she’s been coming back from. All across the board the girls did great.” \nKaul had still felt some pain from tendinitis that built up in her hip after the bone healed in the hip. \n“Today was the first day I didn’t feel any pain,” Kaul said. \nIt was the third straight regional title for the Bulldogs and it was equaled by Sandpoint’s boys, who had 30 points, followed by Moscow (41) and Lakeland (63). \nFinan Lund-Andersen led Sandpoint, taking fourth (17:12). Winner Josh Corgatelli of Moscow (16:18) led a 1-2-3 finish. 5A Region I \nCoeur d’Alene junior Caitlin Conway was nearly a minute faster than a month ago (19:29), taking the regional title. Post Falls freshman Jazzmin Kernodle (20:06) was second. \n“A lot of the back stretch of the course you have to stay awake and be focused,” Conway said. \nSixth a year ago, Conway can challenge for the title. \n“She was on fire today,” CdA coach Cathy Compton said. “She can definitely be in the money next week.” \nThe top two boys and girls teams each qualified for state. The Viking girls, who have won three straight state titles, captured their sixth consecutive regional title, finishing with 28 points. Lewiston (58) was second. \nIn the boys, CdA edged Lewiston. The Viks had 30 points to Lewiston’s 35. \nJunior Austin Byrer of Lewiston had no problem winning (16:12). He was followed by two teammates. Alex Walde (17:02) of CdA took fourth. 3A District I \nThe Timberlake girls and boys dominated, each taking seventh straight district titles. \nThe Tigers girls, who placed five in the top six, had 18 points. Runner-up and state qualifier Bonners Ferry had 43. \nIn the boys, Timberlake scored 34 points. Bonners Ferry (52) edged Priest River (56) for the second berth. \nTimberlake’s Taylor Hammond (20:05) was by herself, finishing 30 seconds ahead of teammate Abigail Peightal. \n“I was pushing myself as best I could,” Hammond said. “I wish there was someone to go with me.” \nHammond, a junior, took 13th at state last year. \n“My goal is to win it,” Hammond said. “Shelley has a lot of good runners. My times are right there with their top girls.” \nBrayden Menti of Timberlake (17:18) pulled away in the final mile to beat teammate Landon Davis (17:37). \nMenti earned a medal at state last year among the top 20, placing 18th. \n“I had a good race. I gave it my all. That’s all you can do,” said Menti, whose goal is to finish in the top five.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:07:00.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
