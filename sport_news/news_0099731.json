By Eric Turner Special to The Capital-Journal \nEvery time spirited Topeka West had momentum going its way, Hayden answered with a big run to keep the Chargers at bay in the Wildcats’ 47-28 victory Friday night at Hummer Sports Park. \nWest (1-5, 0-5) was within one score of Hayden (5-1, 5-1) at 21-13 with 2:59 left in the third quarter before Hayden outscored West 26-15 the rest of the way. Hayden scored on four straight possessions — keyed by big runs — in the second half. \n“Overall, a win’s a win,” Hayden coach Bill Arnold said. “I thought our kids did a lot better job blocking the second half. We were kind of helter skelter in the first half, running different things, but we were better in the second half and did what we do well.” \nConnor Hobart and Tomas Stringer scored three touchdowns each for Hayden, which rushed for 294 yards and had 465 yards of total offense. \nDaniel Gaito was Hayden’s leading rusher with 110 yards. Hobart scored on runs of 1, 17 and 32 yards and Stringer scored on runs of 1, 2 and 1 yards on goal-line situations. \nHayden’s final score came on Mason Dodd’s 48-yard reception from Dallas Crittenden with 18 seconds left. \nWest got within 14-7 on Zach Shima’s 3-yard touchdown run, two plays after Zach Glaze had a 61-yard fumble return. \nFrom there, Hayden scored on its next four possessions. The first was set up by a 51-yard run by Andrew Smith, the second on a 24-yard gain by Stringer, the third on an 18-yard gain by Smith and Hobart scored the fourth untouched on a 32-yard TD that made it 41-21 with 9:50 left. \n“They had one big play in the second half that they got three scores off of,” West coach John Tetuan said. “We just didn’t make the adjustment.” \nShima threw for 262 yards and three touchdowns on 24-of-43 passing. \nChallim Claiborne caught two touchdowns, and Jordan Newby had 14 catches for 141 yards and a score. \nHayden (5-1, 5-1) 8 6 21 12 — 47 \nTopeka West (1-5, 0-5) 0 0 13 15 — 28 \nHayden — Hobart 1 run (Peavler pass from Schumacher) \nHayden — Stringer 1 run (pass failed) \nTW — Shima 3 run (Claiborne kick) \nHayden — Stringer 2 run (Dodd kick) \nTW — Claiborne 11 pass from Shima (kick blocked) \nHayden — Hobart 17 run (pass failed) \nHayden — Stringer 1 run (Peavler pass from Crittenden) \nTW — Claiborne 25 pass from Shima (Claiborne pass from Shima) \nHayden — Hobart 32 run (run failed) \nTW — Newby 8 pass from Shima (Claiborne kick) \nHayden — Dodd 48 pass from Crittenden (kick failed) \nGAME IN FIGURES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:47:53.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
