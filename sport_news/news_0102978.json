New London’s defense adjusted and quickly covered Politis, forcing Derosier to look off to his secondary target, Chace Wood. The senior was coming across the field with a defender in front and one trailing. “The kid (in front of Wood) came up to bite on me and I just lofted it over him,” Derosier said. The ball sailed into Wood’s hands. It was the third touchdown pass of the night for Derosier, who helped lead Killingly to a 35-13 win over the Whalers Friday. Signature win It was the first win for the Redmen (5-1) over New London since 2003. “To beat New London, that says something,” Killingly coach Chad Neal said. “They have a great coaching staff and year after year, they are the team that you look at as one of the teams in the top echelon in the conference. I think this was a signature win for us.” New London challenged Derosier on Friday night, stacking the box to stop running backs Austin Caffrey and Spencer Lockwood. It’s something Derosier is going to have to get used to. “They were going to take away our running game,” Neal said. “Kyle and the receivers really stepped up.” Derosier (119 yards passing) only threw the ball nine times, but five of them were caught, including three of them in the end zone. None were prettier than the pass to Wood. At first, Derosier thought the defender tipped the ball into Wood’s hands. He realized just how nice of a pass it was when Wood told him that wasn’t the case and the ball was right on his hands. “What touch,” Neal said with a shake of his head. “It was a great pattern, they nailed it.” While it was the nicest, it probably wasn’t the most important — those came a bit earlier. New London (1-6) stymied Killingly in the first quarter and kept the ball on the Redmen’s side of the field, but just couldn’t punch it in. “We had good position and the game was going the way we wanted it to go,” New London coach Duane Maranda said. “We got the defensive stops we wanted to and we matched their physicality, which we knew would be a big challenge.” Page 2 of 2 - Air threats But while the Whalers slowed down the run game, they couldn’t account for the Derosier-Politis combination. The pair began to strike at the end of the first quarter when Derosier found the senior down the middle of the field for a 37-yard completion. It set up a 6-yard TD run by Spencer Lockwood, who finished with 133 yards in 25 carries and two scores. New London tied the game when Melquann Gomez (26-for-49 passing, 328 yards) hit Giovanni Lopez with a 6-yard pass. But Derosier answered. He finished off a 75-yard drive, highlighted by a 47-yard run by Caffrey (25 carries, 176 yards), with a 23-yard strike to Politis (3 catches, 84 yards). “I love Politis, he’s my main man,” Derosier said. Neal loved him, too, when he reeled in a 24-yard pass with 22 seconds left in the first half to put the Redmen up, 21-7. “Those throws were on the money, (Derosier) had a great night,” Neal said. “His confidence came along. I talked to him after the first couple of drives and I told him, ‘Kyle, we’re going to need you (Friday). You have to make the throws, because if you don’t, they’re going to take away the running game. He took over and that was the difference.” By Marc Allard The Bulletin The Bulletin By Marc Allard The Bulletin Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 11:17 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:04:29.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
