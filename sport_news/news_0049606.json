Miller. \nCHICAGO — The way the Rangers played in their season opener won’t win them the Stanley Cup. \nBut it’s a long way from October to June and on this Wednesday night, the Rangers did just enough to spoil the Blackhawks’ third Cup banner raising ceremony since 2010, winning, 3-2, at the United Center despite being beaten to the puck the majority of the last two periods. \n“There was a lot of time spent in our zone,” captain Ryan McDonagh said. “We played sloppy with the puck and we were not connecting the dots. Sometimes, you’ve got to find a way. It wasn’t pretty by any means but it was a good first period.” \nHenrik Lundqvist, making his 10th straight season-opening start, one short of tying Eddie Giacomin’s franchise record, stopped 32 shots, including all 14 he faced in the third period as he, at least, appeared to be in midseason form. \nThe Blackhawks appeared to tie the score at 19:00 of the third period but referee Steve Kozari waved off Jonathan Toews’ apparent equalizer because he lost sight of the puck at the post. A video review proved inconclusive so the initial call stood. \n“I could kind of feel the puck under my pads so I think it’s a good call,” Lundqvist said. \n“It is a close call. I heard the whistle.” \nOne positive for the Rangers was the contributions they got from their young forwards, whose development they are counting on for a successful season. Derek Stepan and rookie Oscar Lindberg both scored, J.T. Miller had two assists and Kevin Hayes added one. \n“For our line, I thought we played smart and made plays at the right time,” said Miller, on Lindberg’s left wing along with Viktor Stalberg. “We didn’t turn the puck over very much.” Corey Crawford made 24 saves for the Blackhawks. \nIf the Rangers needed any more motivation for this season, coming off a Game 7 loss in the Eastern Conference final to the Lightning — derailing a chance to face the Blackhawks and a second straight trip to the Stanley Cup Final — the Blackhawks’ latest banner raising certainly should provide some. \n“You want to be the team, the first game of the year, to be doing what they’re doing,” said defenseman Keith Yandle, who set up partner Kevin Klein’s rising shot from the left circle to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead at 16:38 of the first period on a delayed penalty. “I think it’s a good thing to start on the road and kind of get a bitter taste — or a taste — of what we’re striving for.” \nThe Rangers, who have advanced to the conference final in three of the past four seasons, were not first-hand witnesses to the pregame ceremony, remaining in their dressing room until the raucous, lengthy celebration ended. The ceremony ran longer than expected so the Rangers waited nearly 45 minutes between the end of warmups and the opening faceoff. \n“You wonder who has the toughest challenge, us sitting in the locker room for 45 minutes or them because it must be emotional,” Lundqvist said. “When you’re delayed, you get a little upset. You want to go out and pay them back.” \nPlus, when the Rangers lined up for the national anthem, they all had a clear look at the Cup on display in the Blackhawks’ zone. \nLindberg connected off Miller’s feed for a 1-0 lead at 1:43 and Hayes, after missing a backhander at the post, made a great individual effort to feed Derek Stepan at the crease for a 3-1 lead with 59.0 seconds remaining. But the Blackhawks came within 3-2 at 6:55 of the second period with Marian Hossa feeding Teuvo Teravainen in the slot.
