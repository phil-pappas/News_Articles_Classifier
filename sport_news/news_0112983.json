Wilks maneuvered himself into 39th place with a time of 16:55.0 on the 2.9-mile course at Spencer Park in Belvidere, snatching up the last individual sectional qualifying spot available. The top six teams and the next best five individuals in Saturday’s Class 2A Belvidere Regional qualified for next week’s sectionals. “I wanted more; I didn’t want to make it that close. But I’ll take it,” Wilks said. “I had some trouble at the halfway point, but I regrouped, and I didn’t get passed at the end, which is always a goal.” Wilks was the lone Pretzel boy to make it through, but the Freeport girls team soared to 101 team points, taking third and advancing as a team. Freshman Gabby Rodriguez led the way with a 14th-place finish in 19:01. “Wow, now we can go into sectionals and see what we can do,” Rodriguez said. “It’s just a great feeling, but we know we’re going to have to re-focus for next week, and be ready.” Sophomore Allison Kundert (20th in 19:33), freshman Sophia Wilks (21st in 19:34), sophomore Cassidy Grunewald (22nd in 19:37) and Kyla Wilcox (24th in 19:39) all came across in a pack that extended the Pretzels’ season. “They had to work for it, and I would have liked them to be a little further up that first mile,” Freeport coach Alan Greene said. “But the girls are running good, and I hope they show up next week to really compete. We’ll see.” Jay Taft: 815-987-1384; mailto:jtaft@rrstar.com ; @JayTaft", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:32:12.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
