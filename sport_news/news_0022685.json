Bhatti had escaped from the custody of Constable Harbans Lal from the court complex after a hearing on October 13. While Poonam was arrested from the spot, Rajbir and Sunny had fled along with Bhatti in a car. Sunny, a resident of Sector 49, Chandigarh, who hails from Gurdaspur district, was nabbed near Dera Mansar Mukerian, Hoshiarpur. An i10 car was also recovered from the parking of Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Sohana, which was used by the accused for facilitating Bhatti’s escape from police custody. “Sunny was on the run for the past four days during which he also visited Jwalamukhi town in Himachal Pradesh,” said a police official. Bhatti, son of a head constable of the Punjab Police, was arrested in May this year by the UT police after a chase. He had fired shots at a police party during his arrest. Bhatti has four cases registered against him in Chandigarh and several cases in Punjab. He will be produced in court tomorrow. Police officials said Rajbir and Sunny were waiting in a car outside the District Courts, Sector 43. Bhatti escaped from the court complex in an i10 car. The duo dropped the accused near a gurdwara in Sohana, Mohali. Sunny already has a case registered against him at the Sector 36 police station for affixing a fake registration plate on a motorcycle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:00:31.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
