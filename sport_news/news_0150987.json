It looks good for the league and the city of Hamilton.\n“I’m hoping one day we can get something as nice as that.”\nThe Stamps certainly will if the CalgaryNEXT proposal comes to fruition.\nThere were still a couple hundred tickets for Friday night’s game remaining as of Thursday afternoon. Those will probably be snapped up by a walkup crowd but if not, it would be the first Tiger-Cats game that hasn’t been sold out since the stadium opened on Labour Day of last year.\nTiger-Cats fans have obviously paid their dues over the years and Raymond said they deserve the modern digs.\n“They’re some of the best fans in the league,” Raymond said. “They’re hard-working, blue-collar fans and they love their football. I’m glad they finally got something in Hamilton to call a nice home.”\nMcDaniel, who developed into one of the top targets in the CFL after leaving the Tiger-Cats for the Stampeders, remembers his time in The Hammer fondly.\n“I had a great time there,” McDaniel said. “That’s where I was introduced to the CFL.\n“The crowd was always good. We were about a .500 team but the fans at Ivor Wynne were always good.\n“I definitely have a lot of good memories there.”\nMcDaniel, who sits second in the league with 63 catches and third with 815 yards, said when there’s only one game in town, the fans develop a special bond with the team.\n“They would come out and were rowdy and excited,” McDaniel said. “They love the Ticats.\n“It’s such a small city and they love football.\n“Now they’ve got a nice little stadium out there and the fans pack it every week.”\nBy the time kickoff rolls around, Friday night will likely be no exception.\nscott.fisher@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/SUNScottFisher\nStampeders\nCalgary Stampeders anxious to finally get a look at Ticats' new digs\nBy Scott Fisher , Calgary Sun First posted: Thursday, October 01, 2015 06:29 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 01, 2015 08:16 PM EDT\nHAMILTON — The Calgary Stampeders are late to the housewarming party.\nIn fact, they missed it altogether.\nThe Stamps will be the last CFL team to visit Tim Hortons Field, the shiny new home of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, when they show up Friday night (5:30 p.m., TSN/News Talk 770).\nFormer Tiger-Cats slotback Marquay McDaniel was among those excited to check out the 24,000-seat venue.\n“I heard it’s nice, it looks nice on film,” McDaniel said. “I haven’t seen the inside yet.\n“Winnipeg is real good, so I’m expecting something similar to that.”\nIt’s quite a bit smaller than Winnipeg’s Investors Group Field but there’s little doubt it’s a massive improvement on Ivor Wynne Stadium, which was built in 1928 and was long past its expiration date when it was torn down three years ago.\nWas there a more grim stadium in the country than ol’ Ivor Wynne?\n“No, I don’t think so,” Stamps linebacker Keon Raymond said with a laugh.\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos 'I woke up on park benches some mornings': New revelations in Rob Ford's past drug use\n0\nHeroic army vet shot 7 times trying to stop Oregon gunman\n0\nOregon gunman had cache of 13 weapons: Federal agent\n0\nCops Taser man inside Oshawa Tim Hortons\n0\nJulian Fantino charged with assault over 1973 arrest\n0\n'We began to run': Oregon college massacre survivor\n0\nOregon gunman had cache of 13 weapons: Federal agent\n0\nTori Spelling sex admission a new low in the celeb fame game\n0\nFinal 'Spectre' trailer sees Bond out for blood\n0\n'Survivor' castoff Shirin Oskooi says Abi-Maria is a bully\n0\nZabi Akbari - Witness To Kirby Rd Fatal Crash\nVaughan crash eyewitness\nPlenty Of Work Left For Leafs\nPat Kane Video\nRaptors media day\nMore from Football New York Jets ready to wipe some butt this weekend in London 0\nBritish treasury chief wants to have permanent NFL team in London within 5 years 0\nRavens beat Steelers in OT for first win of season 0\nBurris sets passing record in Ottawa RedBlacks romp 0\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers receiver Kevin Cone finds life moves quickly 0\nInside Toronto sun.com News\nMontana woman dies from rare black bear attack 0", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SUNScottFisher", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:00:41.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
