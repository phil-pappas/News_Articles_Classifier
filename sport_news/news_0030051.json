Alabama-Auburn. Michigan-Ohio State. Oklahoma-Texas. Georgia-Florida. Harvard-Yale. USC-UCLA.\nSaturday in Calgary is no late Labour Day Replay.\nRelated - Eskimos Mike Reilly can feel for Bombers' Matt Nichols\nLabour Day games can make a season no matter where you sit in the standings. This one is ABOUT where you sit in the standings.\n“Yeah, this is different. Whoever wins this one is going to get first place. You can’t do that on Labour Day,” said defensive lineman Almondo Sewell.\n“It’s about a first-place bye. It’s important to get the first-round bye. That’s being one win from the Grey Cup. That’s what we all said that we wanted at the beginning of the year. Now we’re going down there to try get it.”\nIt’s both simple and mildly complicated at the same time.\nThe Edmonton part of it is mildly complicated.\nIf the Eskimos win, both teams will be 11-4. But Edmonton would get first place if the two teams end up tied at the end of the season. The Eskimos have the easier schedule with two home games (B.C. and Montreal) and one away game (Saskatchewan). Calgary has one home game (Saskatchewan) and two away games (B.C. and Toronto in Hamilton).\nThe Calgary part is simple.\nIf Calgary wins they’ll be 12-3 and Edmonton 10-5 and the Stampeders will have the season series and be one win away from getting the bye to the Western final for a third straight season.\nEdmonton hasn’t played host to the West final since 2003.\nA Calgary win would also be John Hufnagel’s 100th as a head coach in his final year on the sidelines.\nNobody suggests it’s going to be easy.\nAfter a 12-game losing streak the Eskimos brought to a halt in the last meeting between these two teams there’s more belief, for sure. But that game was in Edmonton. This one is in McMahon, where the Stampeders are 7-0.\nThere’s Jon Cornish, back from injury and putting up 150-yard games again and his remarkable run of being utterly unstoppable against Edmonton. Then there’s quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell and his 26-5 record. And there’s more than that, says Sewell.\nRelated - Simpson compares game to Super Bowl\n“Having won that last one against them is real huge but this week is going to be a real test because they got their whole offensive line back now. They were a little bit dinged up. They got Spencer Wilson back at guard, they have Pierre Lavertu playing pretty well, they got Shane Bergman playing really well, they got a real solid left tackle in Edwin Harrison who broke his leg and Dan Federkeil is back healthy now. That’s one of the best offensive lines we’re going to see all year right now.\n“We’ll put the whole thing together. We have confidence in winning right now.”\nNow that the Eskimos have won once, they can win again.\n“Any time you beat your nemesis, your arch rival, the team that beat you four times last year, you are allowed mentally to know you can beat them,” said coach Jones.\n“I mean, we knew we could compete with them but we could actually see that we can make enough plays to win the game.”\nAfter the 12 losses in a row the question was simply if this team was yet built to beat Calgary.\nGoing into this game the question is more if Edmonton can come together in all phases of the game to play something more resembling a complete game.\nPutting the whole thing together is something the Eskimos haven’t done lately. Every time they get one tire pumped up another one goes flat.\n“That’s what is yet to be seen. That’s a good question. We haven’t played well in all three phases in quite some time. We’re going to need an awfully good effort to beat that team down there,” said Jones.\nFollow me on @sunterryjones\nterry.jones@sunmedia.ca\nIt’s about a first-place bye says Edmonton Eskimos' Almondo Sewell\nBy Terry Jones , Edmonton Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 07, 2015 04:27 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 08, 2015 12:19 AM EDT\nThere’s a difference going to Calgary for a Labour Day Classic in September to going back to McMahon Stadium for Game 15 in October.
