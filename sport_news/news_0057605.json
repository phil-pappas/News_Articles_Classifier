Even if the Eagles lose, they won’t be out of the running for the division title.\nOn the surface, it would seem to be tough to recover from a 1-3 start, and 0-2 in the division. But look around. The Dallas Cowboys (2-1) won’t have quarterback Tony Romo and star wide receiver Dez Bryant until early November at the earliest, perhaps not until after the Eagles play in Dallas on Nov. 8.\nDuring that time, the Cowboys will have games against the teams in last season’s Super Bowl -- the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots. They’ll also have a division game at the Giants, who would love to atone for blowing a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter to Dallas in the opener.\nThe Giants (1-2) finally got a win last week, but they have their share of issues, starting with the NFL’s worst pass defense. They allow a whopping 410.3 yards passing per game. You would think Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford could complete at least one deep pass against that defense.\nAnd as for Washington (1-2), Kirk Cousins has a career record of 3-9 and has thrown more interceptions (23) than touchdowns (21).\nThat’s not to say the Eagles don’t have any problems. They do. Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford hasn’t inspired much confidence in his play. He has a career record of 19-32-1, and he has yet to complete a pass that has traveled more than 20 yards in the air this season. DeMarco Murray is only 374 yards behind his pace from last season.\nAnd the wide receivers not named Jordan Matthews have as many catches (13) and yards (122) for the season as Atlanta’s Julio Jones gets in one game by himself.\nSo, really, the division is still completely up for grabs. And that’s what makes this game against Washington a critical one for the Eagles. If Dallas were to lose at New Orleans, which is 0-3 this season, that would put the Eagles in a first-place tie. The Cowboys would have the tiebreaker for now, based on their win over the Eagles on Sept. 20.\nBut the Eagles have a more favorable schedule until their next meeting with the Cowboys in Dallas. They’ll have New Orleans and the Giants at home, and a tough Carolina team on the road before facing the Cowboys following a week off.\nThe Eagles would love to believe that they’ll have their offensive problems worked out by then, behind a running game in which both Murray and Ryan Mathews are thriving.\nAfter all, the Eagles have struggled offensively in the past two seasons under head coach Chip Kelly and always found a way to win. The offense continued to struggle against the Jets, too, but Darren Sproles’ 89-yard punt return for a touchdown bailed them out. The defense helped out by intercepting Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick three times.\nIt may not have been pretty, but the Eagles found a way. They might have to do that again against Washington, especially in rainy and windy conditions. Kelly said he would be fine with that.\n“I’m just concerned with Washington,” he said. “I don’t care if we score two points and win 2-0, or we score 52 points and win 52-51. We are concerned with beating Washington. We don’t look at it as, ‘We need to do this,’ and, ‘We need to do that.’ It’s what do we need to do in the football game on Sunday to win.”\nIt works the same way for Washington. Should it find a way to win without top receiver DeSean Jackson, who you know must really be injured to sit out a game against his former team, then all of a sudden, the possibilities seem endless.\nWashington coach Jay Gruden knows this.\n“Very critical, no question about it,” he said. “It’s early in the year, no doubt. But we’re both one game out of first place and that’s what we care about. We care about our division, number one, first and foremost. Playing division games at home, you’ve got to win them.”\nIt’s already clear that there are no perfect teams in the division. That is, unless you count the Atlanta Falcons, who are 3-0 against NFC East teams this season. They’ll try to run the table with a game next week against Washington.\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
