For Tecumseh High School volleyball coach Angie Lizza that moment came a little sooner than expected. \nIt was a scrimmage against Beavercreek that left Lizza thinking “this could be a rough season.” \nIt was, but for the Arrows’ opponents. Tecumseh — which rattled off 12 straight wins after dropping its season opener to Troy — won the Central Buckeye Conference Kenton Division championship for its first league title since 1995. \nTecumseh (20-3) carries that momentum into the tough Division I sectional tournament against Springboro (14-9) in the second round tonight at 7:30 at Butler High School. Tecumseh beat Stebbins 25-10, 25-6, 25-10 in the first round Monday. \nTecumseh is seeded No. 5 and Springboro is No. 6. The winner advances to play either No. 4 Centerville or No. 13 Wayne on Saturday for the sectional championship. \n“Going against the (Greater Western Ohio Conference) schools is always hard,” Lizza said. “If we can win out at sectionals that would be great. Once you hit district it’s tough when you get the Cincinnati teams.” \nSenior leadership is credited as a key reason the Arrows are having one of their best seasons. In addition to the league title, the Arrows tied the school record for regular-season wins. \nThe five seniors — Lindsey Nartker, Caroline Smith, Baylee Pursifull, Laura Hillard and Brooke Barger — also helped the Arrows win league as eighth-graders. \n“It was definitely worth waiting,” Pursifull said. “It was great that it was on our Senior Night, especially since it was our last game we’re ever going to play in that gym.” \nThe three-set win against Bellefontaine was another impressive win in a season full of them, especially after going 12-11 the season before. \n“No, I wasn’t (expecting to win league) to be honest,” Smith said. “I think I knew we could after we played Tipp City the first time. That game we clicked so well. It was a great way for us to play.” \nIn a season of superlatives Nartker has established a few personal ones, too. She set the school record for kills in a match (31), kills in a season (351) and kills in a career (1,000). \n“I knew I was close to a season record, but it didn’t matter as much to me,” Nartker said. “I just wanted to win that last game so we could (win league). It ended up that way. \n“It’s been amazing. I love getting to play with these girls, it’s so much fun and we push each other to get better.” More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:51:00.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
