(AP) â€” Joao Plata and Luke Mulholland scored 10 minutes apart in the first half and Real Salt Lake beat Colorado 2-1 on Sunday night to eliminate the Rapids from the playoff race. \nThe Rapids (8-12-10) struck first. Kevin Doyle headed a long cross from Sean St. Ledger in the 16th minute, snapping a shot from 15-yards out that found its way into the far corner. \nReal Salt Lake (10-12-8) struck back in the 33rd minute when Plata bent a free kick over the Colorado wall and just under the crossbar. \nJuan Manuel Martinez' shot in the 43rd minute was headed away by Colorado, but Mulholland headed the ball to his feet and one-timed a crisp shot from the top of the penalty area that found the far corner. \nRSL is three points out of the final playoff spot with three games remaining. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
