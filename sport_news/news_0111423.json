His victory also paced Vineland’s first-through-fifth sweep, as the program earned its first team title since 2011. \n“It all came down to this,” said Mayo, who crossed the finish line in 17 minutes, 27.59 seconds. “We’ve been wanting this since I was a freshman, and I’ve had these guys right behind me. … This was our year. This was something we really wanted and we finally did it.” \nMillville’s McKenzie Springsteadah had a similar feeling earlier in the day when she turned around during the final stretch of the girls’ race en route to her second consecutive title. \nSpringsteadah, who finished in 21:09, saw two of her teammates trailing her and she knew Millville had reclaimed the team title it had lost to Vineland last season, snapping a stretch of seven straight championships for the program. \n“I’m proud of all of them for working hard,” Springsteadah said. “We couldn’t have done it without each other.” \nThe Thunderbolts closed with 21 points, 17 better than Vineland, which took second with 38. Bridgeton was third with 82 and Cumberland placed fourth with 100.
