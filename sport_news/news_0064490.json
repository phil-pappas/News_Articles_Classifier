The Rangers also extended their lead over the Astros in the West to 2 1/2 games.\nThe Rangers leading the West with 16 games to play? That defies logic.\nOn May 3, the Rangers were 8-16. They had suffered more losses than any team in the American League and sat 9 1/2 games back of the Astros -- farther out of first place than any team in baseball except the Milwaukee Brewers.\nIs it logical that the Rangers would go 71-51 from that point to vault over Oakland, Los Angeles, Seattle and Houston into first place in the West?\nOn June 19, the Rangers were 12-25 in divisional play in the AL West, including nine losses to the A's. The Angels had routed the Rangers 13-0 in one game, and both the A's and Astros paddled them by 10-0 scores. The Rangers were five games under .500 at that point and 6 1/2 games back of both the Angels and Astros.\nIs it logical that the Rangers would go 17-9 in the division from that point to seize control of the West?\nOn July 28, the Rangers were 16-28 at home with losing streaks of eight, five and four games. The Rangers were five games under .500 at that point and eight games back of both the Angels and Astros.\nIs it logical that the Rangers would go 22-5 at home from that point to put their playoff destiny in their own hands?\nIs it logical that a team that ranks 24th in baseball in pitching and 28th in fielding could sit atop a division with three weekends remaining? Is it logical that a team that has allowed more runs than it has scored this season could be on the doorstep of the playoffs?\n\"It's not logical,\" Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. \"But baseball is not logical. It's illogical.\"\nBut the team that will finish the season for the Rangers is not the same team that started the season. It would have been illogical for that team of April to have contended. The bullpen has been overhauled since then. A pitching ace (Cole Hamels) arrived. Two power hitters have been added (Josh Hamilton, Mike Napoli). And the Rangers as a team survived what, at times, was a painful learning curve.\n\"We had a lot of want-to ,\" said Banister of the early-season struggles. \"Now we've gotten a lot better at our know-how â” with the same amount of want-to in us. These are talented guys. They're not rookies. They're not playing on sheer talent alone. They've been playing a certain way for a long time, and now they're asked to play maybe a little different brand of baseball and being able to put all that together.\n\"I continue to believe that what I saw in spring training is what I thought we could be. But we put ourselves in such a hole [early], we had nowhere to go other than up. You can't put logic to any of this. We've improved and we've continued to improve. We've been resilient enough to learn to be able to win ballgames.\"\nThe key has been the dramatic turnaround at home. The Rangers were able to stay within striking range all summer long because they owned the best road record in the American League. Now they are playing as well at the Globe as they are away from the Globe. Better, in fact.\n\"We realized as a team what we were missing,\" Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus said. \"Every time we played on the road we were really aggressive early, the first three, four innings. We were able to score early and set the tone for the game. At home it was the complete opposite. Everyone [else] was scoring first, and it was getting harder and harder to come back.\n\"As a team, we worked on it and you can see a difference. When we're home, we score early. Now we set the tone for the game, and it makes everything easier for us.\"\nThe Rangers jumped out to a 4-0 lead over the Astros on Tuesday night, a 9-0 lead on Wednesday night and a 3-0 lead on Thursday night. This was the second time the Rangers have swept a home series from the Astros since Aug. 1. The Rangers also swept both Baltimore and Tampa Bay in three-game home series during that stretch. Thursday night's victory was the 10th in the last 11 games at the Globe.\n\"We've been playing amazing baseball right now, especially at home,\" Andrus said. \"We're here for a reason. We have an amazing team. If you come in here to Texas, you're going to face a team that's going to be hard to beat. Our confidence is really high right now.\"\nAnd that is logical.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RickGosselinDMN"], "published": "2015-09-18T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:14:02.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
