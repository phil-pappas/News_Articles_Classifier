I want to proudly announce that there wouldn't be any interviews for non gazette entry of group B, C and D. This will be implemented from January 1, 2016\" said Prime Minister Modi.\n\"The process that is underway now, there won't be any intervention now, but from next year there won't be any interview during recruitments in these groups,\" he added.\nPrime Minister Modi had in his Independence Day speech earlier this year said that the reason for corruption was the need for 'approach' felt by the people while applying for jobs and called upon the state governments to avoid the practice of interviews for junior-level posts.\n\"We should end this...Interview can be held for jobs where personality or appearance is important,\" he said.\nThe Prime Minister had also asked all the departments to end the practice of interviews at the earliest and promote merit by recruiting only through transparent, online processes.\nDuring his earlier 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, Prime Minister Modi had stressed that his government was working very fast to end the requirement of interview for certain government jobs.\n\"In my Independence Day address, I had questioned the requirement of interview for lower category jobs. Because whenever a call for interview comes, parents of poor people run from pillar to post, looking for 'sifarish' (recommendation) and 'jack' (help) ... And perhaps this is the reason for corruption at lower levels,\" he said.
