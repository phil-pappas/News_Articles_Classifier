(AP) — Washington Redskins cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall and Chris Culliver, receiver DeSean Jackson and center Kory Lichtensteiger will miss Sunday's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers because of injuries.\nAll four of those starters were sidelined last week, too: Hall by a toe problem, Culliver a knee, Jackson a hamstring and Lichtensteiger a thumb.\nTwo other starters were listed Friday as questionable by coach Jay Gruden because of concussions — left tackle Trent Williams and tight end Jordan Reed — but he said both are expected to be fully cleared and available against the Bucs.\nRunning back Chris Thompson was listed as doubtful with a bruised back after missing practice Friday.\n___\nOnline: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
