The match in Elbasan, central Albania, was policed by more than 2,000 officers, but the game finished without incident.\nInjury time goals from Aleksandar Kolarov and Adem Ljajic gave Serbia a late win.\nDenmark didn't make things easy for the fourth-ranked team in the world and held out for more than an hour till Joao Moutinho's strike sent Cristiano Ronaldo's team to France.\nPortugal had to fight back from a shock home defeat in its opening qualifier, when it was upset 1-0 at home by Albania and coach Paulo Bento stepped down. Under new coach Fernando Santos, the Portuguese won their following six Group I games.\n\"''We started badly and ended well,\" Cristiano Ronaldo said. \"With Fernando Santos, we've gained an extra edge.\"\nNani hit the Danish woodwork in the first half, and Nicklas Bendtner hit the post at the other end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:59:26.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
