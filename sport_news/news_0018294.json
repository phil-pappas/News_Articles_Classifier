Or smaller guys, who can shoot the 3-pointer, put the ball on the floor and go to the basket.\nThis is the small-ball era of the NBA, where perimeter-oriented big guys are fast becoming the norm, rather the exception. So, defensively, Favors knows he has to be prepared for what's to come. But in that preparation, Favors has a message for those who try to exploit him away from the basket.\n  \"They have to guard me, too.\"\nAnd there lies the chess match. Someone like Markieff Morris from the Phoenix Suns may be able to score baskets against Favors on one end. But he'll be parked on the block against Favors on the other end in the low post. And while teams are generally hesitant to venture into the paint against Favors and Rudy Gobert, their ability to keep a stretch power forward on the floor against that duo may hinge on their ability to play defense.\nFavors, for his part, wants to be hard to deal with in that scenario.\n\"I spent a lot of the summer working on my game offensively,\" Favors said.\nOne reason the Jazz committed to Favors and Gobert, however, is because Favors is the rare big with the mobility to guard inside the paint and away from the hoop. So his defense against pick and rolls, and his defense against smaller players will loom large this season.\nLast Friday night, Morris played well against Favors, hitting threes even with Favors contesting his shot. But one thing Favors is this season is outwardly confident. He's confident that he can make life difficult for most offensively. And he's confident that he can guard his position, even as it morphs away from the hoop.\n\nExum update\nLess than two months removed from ACL surgery, Jazz point guard Dante Exum has been seen doing rehab and walking around Utah's practice facility without crutches or a brace. Exum did some light shooting following practice on Sunday. He was working out on an elliptical on Monday morning during shootaround. Exum still has months to go in his recovery, but he appears ahead of schedule.\n\"Dante is someone who loves to play,\" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. \"He can't play, but he is working out. That shows his commitment.\"\n\nLillard out\nStar Portland guard Damian Lillard missed Monday's game with an injured left ankle. The injury, however, doesn't appear to be too serious. Lillard went through his pregame shooting routine at full speed.\ntjones@sltrib.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:25:26.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
