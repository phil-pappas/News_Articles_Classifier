The Bellagio fired James Cooper Jr. and Mark Branco, and they were arrested in July 2014.\nA 60-count indictment filed Wednesday accuses Cooper, Branco, Jeffrey Martin and Anthony Granito of theft and cheating at gambling. Both charges are felonies and could get the men decades in prison.\nAttorneys for the four men didn't immediately respond to messages.\nProsecutor Jay P. Ramen says Cooper is cooperating with the investigation.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:46:20.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
