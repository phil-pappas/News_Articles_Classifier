For the first time this season, Temple trailed entering the fourth quarter. \nWinless Central Florida, playing rejuvenated football and taking advantage of several Temple miscues, held a 16-14 lead entering the final period on Saturday at Lincoln Financial Field. \nThen, finally, Temple was able to assume control. \nJahad Thomas' 22-yard touchdown run followed by Colin Thompson's sensational two-point conversion catch gave Temple a 22-16 lead with 14 minutes, 3 seconds left. Temple did not relinquish the advantage on its way to a 30-16 win over Central Florida in an American Athletic Conference game.

It's tied for the best start in school history, accomplished three previous times, most recently 1974. \nThe 31,372 at the Linc were holding their breath for a considerable time, especially since UCF (0-7) wasn't playing like a winless squad. \nThe Owls won despite committing four turnovers - one pick-six interception and three fumbles. \nThomas, who gave the Owls some breathing room with his third touchdown of the game on a 21-yard run with 4:54 left, rushed for 199 yards on 31 carries. \nCentral Florida took its first lead of the game on Matthew Wright's third field goal, a 41-yarder with 11:39 left in the third quarter. That gave the Knights a 16-14 advantage. \nLater in the quarter, the Knights had a chance for another score after recovering a fumble on a Temple snap out of the shotgun at the Owls 29. Central Florida was stopped five plays later by a Sean Chandler interception. \nChandler later fumbled a punt that was forced and recovered by UCF's T.J. Mutcherson on the Owls 41. \nShortly after, Chandler made amends by returning a punt 65 yards to the Central Florida 21, thanks to a key block by Sam Benjamin. \nTwo plays later, Thomas scored the go-ahead touchdown. \nTemple scored on its first possession, with Thomas' 12-yard run capping a nine-play, 73-yard drive. Thomas has scored a rushing touchdown in every game this season. The big play on the drive was a 22-yard completion from Walker to Robby Anderson, who made an outstanding leaping grab over Shaquill Griffin at the Central Florida 47-yard line. \nWright's 48-yard field goal with 30 seconds left in the first quarter cut Temple's lead to 7-3. \nWalker hit Ventell Bryant in the back of the end zone for a 3-yard scoring pass with 10:47 left in the first half to increase Temple's lead to 14-3. It was the redshirt freshman's first career touchdown. \nWhen Temple's Adonis Jennings blocked a punt on the next series, putting the ball on the UCF 29, it looked like the Owls had a chance to put their foot on the gas. \nThen the momentum suddenly swung two plays later, when Walker floated a pass that was intercepted by Griffin, who returned it 80 yards for a touchdown. That cut Temple's lead to 14-10 with 7:34 left in the first half. \nLater in the half, Mutcherson recovered Anderson's fumbled punt on the Temple 20-yard line. Wright kicked a 27-yard field goal making it 14-13 Temple at the half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:33:17.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
