Posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 1:00 am Bolduc primed to take over Andover wrestling By Dave Dyer ddyer@eagletribune.com Eagle-Tribune \nANDOVER — Mike Bolduc has never been one to shy away from a challenge and last week he took on a big one. \nBolduc, who is currently the head boys soccer coach at Central Catholic, accepted the head wrestling position at Andover High, which has struggled to compete in the mighty Merrimack Valley Conference. \nHe succeeds Brian Caldwell, who resigned for work/personal reasons after the Warriors went 5-20 last year and 1-23 the year before. Andover has been low in numbers, particularly in the upper weights, and generally put far less experienced wrestlers on the mat than its MVC foes. \n“Just getting back on the mat excites me,” said Bolduc. “I think we can be competitive, but it’ll take two or three years. The MVC is so tough.” \nThe energetic Bolduc, 50, certainly has the background to succeed. He coached as an assistant at Methuen for 10 years, was highly successful at Salem for five years and then helped grow the program in four years at Malden Catholic. \nAt Salem, he developed one of the strongest teams in New England. In 2002, the Blue Devils finished second in New England and, at the start of the 2002-03 season, he led Salem to a memorable 34-33 victory over Timberlane, snapping a 49-meet winning streak. \nThat Salem team eventually placed first in New England but Bolduc wasn’t at the helm at the end. After leading the team to a 10-0 record, he left the team for the Army Reserves, training units headed to war. He handed the team off to his assistant, Mike Shaw. \nFor his deference to his military obligations, Bolduc was named the Eagle-Tribune 2003 Sportsman of the Year. \nAfter returning from active service, Bolduc took over at Malden Catholic and helped develop All-State champions Kyle and Devin Visconti while building the numbers up from 19 to 32 and — at the time — setting a school record for wins at 14. \nBolduc left Malden Catholic in 2011 because of other obligations but he retired from the military last year. \n“After retiring from the military, I wasn’t sure about coaching,” said Bolduc, who currently works for the Department of Defense in Boston. “But I’ve enjoyed coaching at Central and I’m ready for this.” \nAmong the changes Bolduc has already set in place is moving the practice and meet location from the distant Wood Hole Middle School to the new Andover Youth Services facility in the center of town. \n“I’d prefer to be in the school, but this is better than where they were,” said Bolduc. “It will have an advantage as we try to build the youth program.” \nAndover is expected to return 15 wrestlers from last year and Bolduc is hoping to add 8-15 more. That would be a start. \n“It’s going to take some time,” said Bolduc. “Like a lot of sports, a lot of success is because of the culture you build. If I can get that going, and have the kids work a little more before and after the season, we can do it. \n“The problem at first will be coaching different levels. We’ll have a few (wrestlers) with good experience, some with a little experience and others will have no experience. We’ll have to coach all three and tend to them all. \n“Andover is pretty successful in just about every sport. It’s got a lot of great athletes. If we can get a few and build on that, we can also be successful. That’s our goal.” \nInterestingly enough, Andover opens up against his former team, Malden Catholic.
