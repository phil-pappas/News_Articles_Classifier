Marie Evening News - Sault Ste. Marie, MI By ISIAHOTTEN Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 10:11 AM By ISIAHOTTEN Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 10:11 AM RUDYARD — Rudyard defeated Cedarville in a close Eastern UPConference volleyball match Thursday night. After winning the first set, the Rudyard Bulldogs lost the next two and were close to losing the entire match, but managed to come back and win, 3-2. “Cedarville is a much better team than the last time we played them,” said Rudyard coach Ellen Perry. “We were a little inconsistent tonight.” With the two teams neck and neck, communication seemed to be the key to winning. For both teams, when frustration mounted, the talking stopped. “The last two sets, we seemed to stop talking,” said Cedarville coach Marcie Rickley. “When you stop doing those things and are hesitant, the ball is going to hit the floor.” After losing two sets in a row, Rudyard was able to snap out of their drought with the help of some heads up plays. In one volley in the critical fourth set, the Bulldogs had three players lay out in a row to keep the ball alive, with senior Jorgy Trotter being last, diving and hitting the ball with a one handed dig. The ball just barely sailed over the net and the Trojans responded with a quick hit that sent the ball out of bounds. “Those are the moments when you can really get your momentum back,” said Perry. “We talk about having grit and keeping the ball up. Hannah Beelen really came on in that fourth set. She really sparked us.” That moment and spark revived the Bulldogs and led them to finish with the win. Sophomore Beelen ended the night with 12 kills, which is her season high. “I stepped it up in the fourth set and decided I needed to take a leadership role,” said Beelen. “Our seniors are really good to be with on the court and Jorgy and Tayler have really helped me and given me many kind words.” This being the last home game for the season, Rudyard celebrated their seniors. Tayler Stevens earned 10 aces, just one point shy of the school record, and Trotter led her team in digs. Rudyard also won the junior varsity contest, 3-0. By ISIAHOTTEN Sault Ste.
