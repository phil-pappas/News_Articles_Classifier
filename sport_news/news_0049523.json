The Enforcement Directorate has said it wishes to question the former Indian Premier League chief on money laundering charges. “The government should tell us when it will get Lalit Modi back to the country,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters here. He said the Congress would raise the issue inside and outside Parliament. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram wrote to the British authorities two years ago, calling for the deportation of Lalit Modi over money laundering charges, Surjewala said, adding that the then UPA government wanted Lalit Modi to be brought back to face the law. Raising Lalit Modi issue a diversionary tactic of Cong: BJP The BJP today dismissed it as a “diversionary tactic” deployed by the Opposition party to run away from inconvenient questions involving ‘Young Indian’, a company in which Sonia and Rahul Gandhi are “majority” stake holders. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said the Congress was latching onto an “old and stale” issue and BJP leaders Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj had exposed it in Parliament with their replies in the monsoon session. “When Jaitley and Swaraj gave their replies, they had no answers. The Congress was completely exposed. It is an old and stale issue. The Congress is just using a diversionary tactic and running away from inconvenient questions (about Young Indian),” he said. He said it was the then UPA government that did not do enough to bring the formal IPL czar to book. Alleging that Young Indian took loan from a firm involved in black money deals and questioning the manner of its acquisition of Associated Journals, which owns expensive real estate in many cities, Javadekar took potshots at the Congress, saying it should explain such “magical formula” so that youths could benefit from it. He also raked up controversial land deal involving Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra. “He buys land for Rs 8 crore and the seller does not even encash the cheque. He then sells the same land to the same seller for 58 crore in a few months. The Congress gives a loan of Rs 90 crore to Associated Journals and Young Indian is issued shares worth Rs 90 crore. The Congress should explain these magical formula so that our youngsters could benefit,” he said mockingly. Asked what BJP governments in Haryana and at the Centre were doing if the party found the transactions involving Vadra and Young Indian questionable, Javadekar said the “governments must be doing something”. The Congress has dismissed BJP’s charge, saying it was levelling baseless allegations as it sensed imminent defeat in the Bihar Assembly poll. Sonia and Rahul Gandhi own 38 per cent each in Young India, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said. — IANS/PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:20:47.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
