An us-versus-the-world mentality forms and it leads to success. That was certainly the case when Alabama beat Texas A&M 41-23 on Saturday in front of 105,000-plus in Kyle Field. \nSaban on his Thursday radio show used that experience as an example for Alabama fans entering the 2:30 p.m. CT Saturday visit from archrival Tennessee. \n\"It was tough over there, but I'll say this about Texas A&M. And I appreciate this and I hope our fans can hear this because this is the kind of place we should be. You know this is the first place we've played for a long, long time that we never got booed when we came out. First place. Aight, I'm telling you. It was a really nice facility. They had 105,000 people and they cheered their tail off for their team and they made it hard for us to play.\" \nKyle Field was almost completely rebuilt and expanded since Alabama's last visit in 2013. The massive structure is built with a steep slope, making it an intimate setting with every fan on top of the field. \nIt was a factor. \n\"Man we were down in that one end in a tough time in the game and we had two or three false start penalties, didn't snap the ball at the right time,\" Saban said. \"But you talk about loud. You talk about affecting the game, I mean their fans really did affect the game and it says a lot about our players to keep their poise and focus when they got the momentum of the game for us to get it back and continue to stay focused.\" \nJust before halftime and backed up inside its own 10-yard line, Alabama was flagged twice in three snaps for false start. Noise was deafening. \nSaban wants that kind of energy Saturday in Bryant-Denny Stadium. \n\"I think these teams, when they go fastball and they try to run no-huddle, I think it really does affect them and slow them down a little bit if we can create a lot of noise when they have the ball,\" Saban said. \"You can really be supportive of our team and I'm anticipating that because I can tell you we practiced this today. We usually use noise for the offense when we play on the road. We did noise for the defense today in anticipation that you will be making noise when they have the ball and our players on defense won't be able to communicate.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:49:11.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
