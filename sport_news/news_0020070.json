In a rare visit to the Mountain Time Zone, the Bearcats (3-2) of the American Athletic Conference — the same league as recent BYU opponents Memphis, UConn and East Carolina — will test the Cougars (4-2) in a nationally televised (ESPN) showdown at 6 p.m.\n  Independent BYU will return the visit in November of 2016 at historic Nippert Stadium.\nMostly unknown to BYU fans? Yes. Incapable of knocking off the inconsistent Cougars? No.\nCincinnati is a team with one of the best offenses in the country, and will bring a couple of capable gunslingers to the expected shootout, opening-game starter Gunner Kiel and redshirt freshman Hayden Moore, who stepped in when Kiel suffered a neck injury against Memphis and threw for 279 yards and two touchdowns in a 34-23 win over Miami two weeks ago.\nKiel was cleared to return last Sunday, but Cincinnati coach Tommy Tuberville has said he will not name a starter before the kickoff.\n\"I think they are similar enough and the offense similar enough where there won't be significant change [in preparation] on our part,\" BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall said Monday.\nBYU's quarterback situation is unsettled as well, but for a different reason.\nFreshman Tanner Mangum pulled a hamstring in Saturday's 45-38 win over East Carolina and missed four series while fellow freshman Beau Hoge — who grew up in Fort Thomas, Ky., about 10 miles outside Cincinnati — struggled to move the team.\nMangum returned and led the game-winning touchdown drive, and said Tuesday he is \"good to go\" against the well-rested Bearcats but could be a bit limited in his movements.\n\"We will have to plan on him probably being less mobile, and try to build a plan around that,\" Mendenhall said. \"If he happens to be more than that, that is just a bonus. But I think it is better that we plan for him to be less mobile than more.\"\nWhatever the case, the Cougars can't afford to bring a pea-shooter to the party, because Cincinnati is fifth in the country in total offense (587.2) and passing offense (385.8), and 16th in scoring (39.0 ppg.) and BYU's defense was riddled last week by ECU's less-explosive attack, giving up 513 yards.\nTurnovers were the reason the Bearcats lost to Memphis and Temple, which are both undefeated; they rank 116th in turnovers lost and 127th in turnover margin.\n\"Oh man, statistically they are the best [offense BYU has faced],\" Mendenhall said. \"You are talking about [almost] 600 yards a game, and 39 points, and so yeah, they are good. I would say very similar to [ECU]. If possible, they can even run higher tempo than that, and probably are a little bit deeper at the skill positions.\"\nCincy's attack could be even more dangerous, because sophomore RB Mike Boone, who averages 9.6 yards per carry, is expected back from an ankle injury.\nThe Cougars' defense should be closer to full strength than it was against ECU, however, because middle linebacker Harvey Langi is expected back, nose tackle Travis Tuiloma will get more than 20 or so reps after being limited vs. the Pirates, and suspended defensive backs Jordan Preator and Michael Shelton will return.\nOffensive lineman Ului Lapuaho is questionable with an ankle injury.\nMangum said he watched Cincinnati roll Miami two weeks ago and went away impressed with the Bearcats on both sides of the ball. He said he wouldn't be surprised to see the scoreboard get a workout.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:22:23.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
