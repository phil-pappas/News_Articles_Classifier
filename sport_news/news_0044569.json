That would include three runs with the drone hovering overhead and a 90-second to 2-minute highlight video, edited and e-mailed to customers. The drones fly on virtual guide wires that prevent them from hitting obstacles like trees or chairlifts while avoiding crowded areas.\nBoth Copper Mountain and Winter Park have signed one-year agreements with Cape Productions.\nThe company filmed training sessions with the U.S. Ski Team in New Zealand this summer.\n\"The unique camera angles we got and the stunning footage provided our coaches and athletes with a great experience and those images sent to our fans inspired us all,\" U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association spokesman Michael Jaquet said in a statement announcing Cape Productions' resort plan.\nWinter Park initially forged the deal with Cape Productions hoping to test the system in summer at the famed Trestle Bike Park — with one rider at a time flying down a designated trail. But the wait for Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Forest Service approvals pushed back launch.\n\"We don't really have our heads quite around how it would work in the winter,\" Hurlbert said.\nCape Productions is working with the FAA and the Forest Service on what would be the country's first-ever commercial drone permit at ski areas. Soll said he hopes to get that final approval from the FAA in the next few weeks and then will announce start dates at resorts.\nThe Forest Service will oversee the resorts' commercial drone policies through annual operating plans submitted to the agency.\nCape Productions carries a $5 million insurance policy at each ski area.\nThe FAA is still mulling updated regulations on drones but its proposed regulations allow exemptions for nearly 2,000 drone operators who cannot fly drones within 500 feet of the public, which pretty much eliminates the idea of drones at open-to-the-public ski resorts.\nCopper Mountain and Winter Park ban individuals from using drones.\nThe National Conference of State Legislators says 45 states have considered 166 bills regulating drones so far in 2015 and 20 states have passed 26 laws addressing drones.\nWinter Park isn't sure if it will designate a particular run for drone video or use it in the terrain park, or maybe for young racers on its heavily-used race course. The resort also is pondering more practical uses for drones, like lift inspections.\n\"It's fun to explore. It's fun that we have this technology and it's fun to even consider and think of all the possibilities,\" Hurlbert said. \"The applications are just everywhere.\"\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or @jasonblevins\nHow does cape productions work?\nThe company explains it all here: Introducing Cape Productions: The Drone Video Service", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTIPHHPc1Oc", "http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/current-unmanned-aircraft-state-law-landscape.aspx", "https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=18295"], "published": "2015-10-13T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:02:39.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
