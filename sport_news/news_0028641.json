After battling Wallington tough for years — mind you, to no avail — the Falcons were just a few minutes away from the long-awaited victory. \nThe Falcons scored two goals in a span of three minutes late in the second half to take a lead. Everything was in line for the elusive win. \nEven Falcon coach Christopher Alfieri pleaded with his team to continue to play hard. \n\"There's a lot of time left,\" Alfieri bellowed after sophomore forward Julius Rivas gave the Falcons the lead with 12 minutes remaining. \"We have to keep working.\" \nBut Wallington sophomore midfielder Derek Orjuela had other ideas. Orjuela saw a loose ball bouncing his way, so he made a play on it and went hard to the goal. \n\"When the referee said that there were only four minutes left, I said, 'We're losing,' \" Orjuela said. \"It was unbelievable. In my head, I said that we had to win this. Right then, I got the breakaway.\" \nOrjuela got to the loose ball and knocked it past a diving Jarek Hasiak with less than four minutes remaining, enabling Wallington to earn a hard-fought, 2-2 draw with Saddle Brook on Wednesday. \nOrjuela, who also had an assist on Wallington's first goal, scored for the sixth time this season, none bigger. The goal was unassisted. \n\"He's a sophomore who works very hard,\" said Wallington coach Alessandro Barchi. \"He's very determined to the ball. He just jumped to the ball and got there.\" \nOrjuela had two other chances to win the game for the Panthers. He broke past the Saddle Brook defense to fire a shot with one minute remaining that sailed over the crossbar and had another shot in the second overtime on a header that trickled just wide left. \n\"This almost feels like a loss,\" Orjuela said. \"We should have beaten this team.\" \n\"We look to win every game,\" Barchi said. \"We know we're capable of winning every game. We fought hard and played hard, but so did they. They were home and they played well.\" \nAfter a scoreless first half, the Panthers finally got on the board in the 50th minute when Mark Mikanik scored off a pass from Orjuela. \nFor the longest time, it appeared like the goal would stand up, but the undaunted Falcons finally broke through when senior midfielder and captain Mohammed Elshekh made a scintillating play. \nElshekh collected the ball a little past midfield, then made his way up the field, through three Wallington defenders. Elshekh controlled the ball, then fired a high shot that went in to tie the game at 1 with 15 minutes to go, giving the Falcons some life. \n\"I got past the defenders and looked up and just thought that I had a chance,\" Elshekh said. \"It was easily the prettiest goal of the season. I always wanted to beat Wallington. This year, the first game went to overtime and we lost. I was hoping that we could hold on and fight on. The tie is a little disappointing, but I was happy to be able to keep up with them like that.\" \n\"We pride ourselves on defense,\" Alfieri said. \"The ball took a bad bounce and we weren't ready for it. We worked very hard to get the chance we had and we weren't able to hold the lead. But taking them to overtime twice shows that we have a quality soccer team. If we have effort, resiliency and focus, then that can carry us through the rest of the year.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:51:56.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
