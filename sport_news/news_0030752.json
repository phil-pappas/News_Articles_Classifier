By Brent Maycock brent.maycock@cjonline.com \nOn almost any other night, Blake McIntyre’s performance against Pleasanton might have been the postgame talk of the town in Waverly. \nThe senior tailback enjoyed arguably his best game, rushing for career-high 165 yards in the 83-44 victory. \nThis Friday night, however, teammate Garrett Myers had not only everyone in Waverly talking, but also many around the state. A record-setting performance will do that. \nWaverly bounced back from last week’s loss to Burlingame in a big way and Myers led the charge. The senior fullback carried the ball 30 times for a whopping 420 yards and scored 11 — yes, 11 — touchdowns. \nMyers also added an interception return for a score to give him an eight-man state-record 12 touchdowns in the game. That broke the old mark of 11 set by Chase’s Jake Kizzar in 2009 and Fairfield’s Cannon Burns and Wakefield’s Zack Melius in 2014. Myers, who also kicked an extra point, finished with 73 points scored in the game, breaking the old record of 70 by Burns last year. \n“He had a big game, no doubt about it,” Waverly coach Mike Hevel said. “He had a special game.” \nMyers didn’t take long to get going, busting touchdown runs of 51, 38 and 53 yards in the first quarter as Waverly bolted to a 24-0 lead. From there, the game became a shootout with the Blu-Jays and Waverly clearly had the biggest weapon. \nActually, Myers isn’t freakishly big, standing just 5-foot-10 and weighing 215 pounds. But the returning two-way All-Lyon County League pick carries a big presence for the Bulldogs on both sides of the ball (he also had 13 tackles) and also plays on all of Waverly’s special teams, rarely leaving the field if at all. \n“He runs the ball hard and runs in the open field well,” Hevel said. “Our offensive line did a great job of opening holes and he’s probably a little faster than you think. He’s not going to win our league in the 100-yard dash, but he’s faster than you think for his size. The secret is just to get him one or two yards past the line of scrimmage because we’ve seen a lot of people crowd the line and key on him a lot.” \nKeying on Myers did no good Friday night as he proved unstoppable. Myers added touchdown runs of 1 and 35 yards in the second quarter after opening the period with a 40-yard pick six. In the second half, he ran for touchdowns of 33, 12, 34 and 3 yards to get to 10 rushing touchdowns in the game. \nPleasanton scored in the final 1:30 and Waverly got the ball one last time in the game. With the Bulldog players aware that Myers was capable of getting a state record, they pressed Hevel to give him a shot. \n“I told Coach (Ty) Piper to keep him in because they wanted him to do it,” Hevel said. “That last series, I told Coach Piper to give the ball to Garrett every play.” \nMyers only needed one, going 40 yards on his final carry for the record-setting touchdown. \n“He’s a very good high school football player, probably one of the best I’ve coached in my 43 years,” Hevel said. “He’s a pretty humble kid and he’s really appreciative of his teammates. It was a special night.” \nFRIDAY NIGHT STARS \n■ Fullback Derrick Barger keyed Royal Valley’s 27-12 win over Riverside, rushing for 258 yards and three touchdowns as the Panthers improved to 4-1 to double last year’s win total. \n■ Rossville’s Tucker Horak continued his monster season, rushing for 203 yards and three touchdowns and throwing for 220 yards and three scores in the Bulldawgs’ 57-13 rout of St. Marys.
