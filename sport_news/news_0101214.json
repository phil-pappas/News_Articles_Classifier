Comment By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Milford Daily News By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 9:00 PM By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 9:00 PM It would be hard to blame anyone for expecting a little less from the Holliston football team when this season started. Surely these were not the same Panthers that went undefeated en route to a Division 4 Super Bowl title last year. Graduation brought a mass exodus of talent from the Holliston roster. Gone was quarterback Nick Athy, running back Joe Bellomo, receiver Zach Elkinson, linebacker Derek Kiley, and on and on it went. To wit, many of these players are now continuing their athletic careers at the collegiate level. When training camp started, Holliston returned just five starters from the Super Bowl, two of whom were simply filling in for players injured in the state semifinal matchup against Lynnfield. These Panthers were, admittedly, not an exceptionally experienced bunch. It only seemed logical that a step back was in order. One needs to simply look at a Natick team that is just 2-4 this season after years of sitting atop the Bay State Conference to see the impact high turnover can have, even for historically strong programs. But there has been no such decline in Holliston. The names on the field might be different, but so far this season the result is largely the same. Holliston improved to a perfect 6-0 with a 34-0 dismantling of Medway, securing its fifth Tri-Valley League large title in the past seven years. “It just shows the maturity level of this group,” said Holliston coach Todd Kiley. “Yeah, we lacked experience at the beginning of the season in a lot of areas, but they’re a mature group. They’re a lunch-pail group and they go to work every day and they’re confident they can win every time they step on the field. That’s just the attitude of this team.” Obviously, the key to Holliston’s success this season was a significant amount of talent behind last year’s outstanding senior class patiently awaiting its opportunity. Jack Barrett, for instance, has taken the mantle from Athy and proven quite adept at running the Panthers offense. “He’s stepped and done a nice job,” said Kiley. “He’s making smart decisions, not trying to do too much and taking what the defense is giving him.” He’s certainly been helped by the emergence of Brady Wells and Tucker Ciarcello at wide receiver. But in the eyes of Kiley, it’s more than just a handful of players that have helped sustain the consistency of his program. “When you lose production like that you’re going to need kids to step in and fill in and try to piece together what they did,” said Kiley. “You’re not going to replace those kids individually, and that’s really what this team has done. It’s a selfless group working together and doing this thing as a team.” Page 2 of 3 - Despite the undefeated record, though, this year's Panthers are a markedly different team than their predecessors. That Holliston team’s calling card was its high-powered offense, with a tendency to put so much distance between itself and its opponent that many times the second half was nothing more than a formality. Holliston can still move the ball, but these Panthers aren’t quite that powerful. They’ve had to win a number of close games, notably a Week 2 victory over a strong Duxbury team that came down to the final possession. And that is what has impressed Kiley the most — his team’s ability to come through in moments typically reliant on greater experience. “You need to have the mental makeup,” said Kiley. “That mental capacity, you can’t fake it. And you hope the program tries to cultivate part of that. The kids bring it out of each other every year and pass it on to one another.” And while many of these players were at Gillette Stadium last season for the team’s 43-0 victory over Wahconah, a memory they surely cherish, Kiley sees this as a group eager to carve out a legacy of its own. “I think every team that I've had wants to have their own identity and this team is no different,” said Kiley. “They want to leave their own legacy. I think there’s probably a piece of them that wants to prove that they can do just as well as the teams before them.” Ashland honors Cunis Ashland will hold a ceremony during halftime of this Friday night’s game between the Clockers and Bellingham to dedicate the school’s new multi-purpose field and track at the high school to the late William Cunis. Cunis was a native of Ashland who returned to the town after attending Boston College and taught social studies and math at Ashland Middle and High School for 38 years. During that time, he coached the Clockers’ cross country team for 28 years, winning seven league titles and two state championships. Cunis died of lung cancer in 2011. “He was just a tremendous person,” said Ashland coach football Andrew MacKay, who was a student of Cunis’ as a freshman. “He was someone that everyone wanted to be around. He was just such a good person.” In addition to the dedication of William L. Cunis Field and Track, Friday night’s game will also serve as Ashland’s homecoming. “Billy gave his heart and soul to Ashland,” said Jeff Stone, the former Ashland track coach and current athletic trainer at Suffolk University who helped lead the movement for the dedication. “He was a great coach. This was a guy who gave his heart and soul. He didn’t care who you were or what you were, he’d reach out and help you. That was Bill’s legacy.” Page 3 of 3 - Craig Gilvarg can be reached at 508-626-4405 or cgilvarg@wickedlocal.com. Follow him on Twitter @CraigGilvarg.
