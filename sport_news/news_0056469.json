Arizona State beat UCLA 38 to 23 for UCLA's first loss of the year. MICHAEL GOULDING, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » For the first month of the season, whenever UCLA’s offense stalled, it could at least turn to a reliable ground game to lift it out of the doldrums.\nIt happened in Week 2 at UNLV, when the offense put together just one first-half touchdown and carried a 17-0 lead into halftime. Running back Paul Perkins ended up rushing for 151 yards, including a 56-yard run in the second half to ice the game.\nThe script carried over to Week 3 against BYU. As freshman quarterback Josh Rosen threw three interceptions, Perkins shouldered the load, racking up a career-high 219 rushing yards while his backup, Nate Starks, added 81 yards on the ground, including the go-ahead score with 3:19 remaining.\nBut in the 38-23 loss to Arizona State on Saturday night, its first of the season, it hardly went as planned.\nThe Bruins were held to 62 rushing yards and 2.2 yards per carry, their lowest outputs since the 2012 Holiday Bowl when they were held to 33 yards and 1.18 yards per carry in a 49-26 loss to Baylor.\n“They really committed a whole lot of guys to the run,” UCLA coach Jim Mora said of Arizona State on his Sunday teleconference, “more so than any of the four teams we played before then in terms of stacking the box, really bringing guys off the edge, and slanting, and moving.”\nEntering the game, UCLA was averaging 236 rushing yards per contest, and Perkins ranked second in the Pac-12 in rushing with 514 yards.\n“They did a nice job against us on the run,” Mora said. “We’ve been historically a pretty good run team, and we struggled more than we have. I think you definitely want to give them credit.”\nRIOS HOSPITALIZED\nJunior cornerback Marcus Rios was hospitalized for three nights this past week because of “issues in his sinuses,” Mora said.\nRios was admitted to the hospital Tuesday following practice when he reported severe headaches and pressure. Doctors kept him for three nights on an IV and did a blood culture, a lab test to check for bacteria or fungi.\nHe was released Friday and joined the team at the team hotel before Saturday’s game against Arizona State.\nThe tests determined that the headaches did not stem from the life-threatening fungal infection that hospitalized him in the spring of 2013 and was cleared to play against the Sun Devils.\nRios did not start, playing limited snaps in the second half and finishing with one tackle.\n“We would have never put him on the field if there’s even a minute chance that this was something that could be long term,” Mora said. “That’s just not how we operate.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq5mk-ucla.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq5mk-ucla.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:13:36.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
