The Wolverines downed the Pirates in four games, winning 25-17, 18-25, 25-13 and 25-19 Tuesday in Pagosa Springs. The win put Bayfield back over .500 overall at 9-8 and 5-1 in the Intermountain League thanks to a four-match winning streak. “It’s been a journey of improvement for us, trying to be the best we can week to week,” BHS head coach Terene Foutz said. “We played Pagosa strong at home, and it’s wonderful for our girls to play them strong once more. “This result is derivative of the work the kids put into a game plan we put together.” Bayfield has taken its play to the next level in recent weeks. Brooke Kudelski, who used to play for Pagosa Springs, led Bayfield with 14 kills, and she added five digs. Maddi Foutz had 13 kills and 16 digs for a double-double, and she added six aces. Emily Bauer led BHS with 17 digs, and the setters were even in assists, with Courtney Bayles recording 20 and Sydeny Gabbard recording 19. “We are playing together with everyone understanding each other and the job they’re trying to do more,” coach Foutz said. “I really don’t gauge our level on wins and losses. We had preseason losses, but we played really great teams. It’s paying off now.” BHS will host Centauri at 4 p.m. Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:52:44.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
