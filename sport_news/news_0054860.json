Manny Crisostomo mcrisostomo@sacbee.com i \nblindelof@sacbee.com \nDue to drought-induced leaf drop, seasonal curbside pickup in Sacramento began again Monday – two weeks early. \nSacramento modified its leaf season pickup using the claw vehicles by changing the date residents can legally put out leaf piles. Collection began Monday, rather than Nov. 1, and is scheduled to end on the normal date of Jan. 31. \nThe reason for the change is that leaves are dropping to the ground earlier than usual. Joe Benassini, the city’s urban forester, said in a press release that drought can cause early leaf drop. \nAbout 27,000 tons of yard waste are scooped up on streets or dumped into city trucks from green cans filled by residents during leaf season. The city says residents should still fill the wheeled green cans first, then place the excess curbside. \nContainer service occurs weekly, while claw crews take an average of up to two weeks to complete a sweep of the city. All streets will have at least one pickup by the claw by Oct. 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:51:37.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
