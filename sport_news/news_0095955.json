He also honoured the families of the martyrs of the Border Security Force.\nOfficials said that BSF has lost 1,551 men in the battles and in the line of duty on borders, out of which 1,000 have died in J&K border alone. The government has awarded one Mahavir Chakra, 11 Veer Chakra, 4 Kirti Chakra, 12 Shourya Chakra, 231 President Police Medal for gallantry and 870 police medal for gallantry to the force.\nCelebrating the golden jubilee of BSF, a Rs 5 stamp was also released which depicts BSF's camel patrol in the hot deserts of Thar in Rajasthan who are deployed there as part of their duty to guard the international border between India and Pakistan.\nUnion home minister also released a coffee table book and a rich compilation of the martyrs of the BSF who have laid down their lives in the line of duty.\nSingh said that India is making efforts to bring back 17 mentally unsound persons, including four women, who are lodged in Pakistani jails for a very long time\nBSF was raised on December 1, 1965, and had a humble beginning with 25 battalions of armed police of bordering states. With 2.5 lakh personnel in its ranks, it has emerged as the world's largest border guarding force.\nIt guards 6,623 kms stretch of the border of India with Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n\"During the nascent years of its raising, the BSF was tasked to assist Mukti Bahini during liberation war of Bangladesh. It is on record that the BSF had been mobilized in March 1971 itself, well before the breaking out of actual war, during the freedom struggle. These 50 years have been a glorious saga of valour, sacrifices and dedication where BSF has stood up to every challenge and emerged triumphant. BSF has played a pivotal role and contributed immensely to all facets of national security right from its inception. The force has also played a significant role in smothering the menace of militancy/insurgency and succeeded in restoring peace in Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir and North-Eastern states for which the Seema Praharies have earned many accolades and decorations,\" said a statement issued by BSF.\n\"Besides guarding the international border, BSF has shouldered various responsibilities such as election duties, aid to civil authorities during natural calamities, law & order duties with great devotion and dedication,\" it said.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:28:44.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
