Despite a bad hip and her need of a walker, she was going zip lining.\n\"A lot of them think we're crazy,\" Harrahill said. \"Most of them think that they're too old or too scared or I don't know. They just have no idea that they can do such a thing.\"\nZiplining seniors at Tree to Tree Aerial Adventure Park Residents of Highgate Senior Living celebrate Active Aging Week 2015 by ziplining at Tree to Tree Aerial Adventure Park in Gaston. The oldest participant was Willie Mae Harrahill, age 92.\nOn Monday, she joined six other Highgate residents – the youngest, age 69 – for a day-long zip line tour at Tree to Tree Aerial Adventure Park near Gaston. They were accompanied by staff and family members who made sure the residents were able to make the trek through the woods and into the trees.\nThe trip was part of Highgate's celebration of Active Aging Week , an initiative of the International Council on Active Aging held Sept. 27 through Oct. 3. Throughout the week, Highgate offered events such as boating tours, bike rides, and trips to beach.\nTammy Barnette and her husband Robert came Monday to zip line with her mother, Highgate resident Joyce Daffern. Tammy wanted to build memories with her mom, who has early signs of Alzheimer's.\n\"My mother doesn't really like to go out of the house,\" Tammy said. So on this trip, they took plenty of photos. This would be something special to remember.\nJoyce was nervous before they arrived at the course; she nearly turned back when faced with the first (and by all accounts scariest) part that required crossing a narrow rope bridge to the first zip line.\n\"Oh my god, I can't do this,\" Joyce said, her hands shaking as she stared down the wobbly bridge. \"Oh Tammy, I can't do this.\"\n\"Yes you can,\" Tammy said, right behind her mom. \"We can do this together.\"\nAs they inched forward in tandem, Tammy kept up the encouragement: \"You're alright. Just keep on going. This is the worst part.\"\nTwo zip line rides after the harrowing bridge walk, Joyce Daffern was actually smiling.\nWhile she wouldn't admit to having fun, per se, she did say \"It's different. Once you start going down [the zip line] it's not bad, it's just getting off that step.\"\nHarrahill, who had also joined last year's zip lining group, had a blast on the course.\n\"It's a rush to your body,\" Harrahill said. \"It feels so good.\"\nShe said she'd be back for another zip line trip in 2016, \"if the Lord's willing and the creek don't rise.\"\n\"You don't even think of the numbers,\" Harrahill said of her age. \"As a matter of fact, I think back and it doesn't seem that long ago, my husband's been gone 30 years and it doesn't seem that long. I don't think of time, I just go on and live day to day, every day. I love excitement though. I love people and excitement.\"", "external_links": ["http://activeagingweek.com/", "http://www.icaa.cc/", "http://tree2treeadventurepark.com/", "http://www.highgateseniorliving.com/assisted_living/Vancouver_WA/zip_98665/highgate_senior_living/3403"], "published": "2015-09-30T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:37:04.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
