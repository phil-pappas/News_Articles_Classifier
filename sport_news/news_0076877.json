Big-play threat Adoree’ Jackson, normally a starter at cornerback, primarily will play wide receiver. Speedy freshman running back Ronald Jones II (8.6 ypc) is expected to have a larger role with Tre Madden (knee) banged up. And the offensive line could have a different look if left tackle Chad Wheeler (concussion) remains out. How all of that manifests on game day remains to be seen. Utah relies heavily on senior running back Devontae Booker, who averages 130.5 rushing yards per game. Booker has carried the ball at least 21 teams in every game. Quarterback Travis Wilson (San Clemente High) also is a running threat, having rushed for 203 yards and three touchdowns. Wilson isn’t asked to do as much through the air as counterpart Cody Kessler but is generally smart and efficient. Wilson has a 25-8 TD-INT ratio over the past two seasons. EDGE: USC\nDEFENSE\nDespite losing standouts Eric Rowe and Nate Orchard to the NFL draft (both were second-round picks), Utah remains stout defensively. The Utes lead the nation in interceptions (13) and the Pac-12 in rushing defense (113.5 ypg). Utah is second in the conference in scoring defense (19.5 ppg) and total defense (369.5 ypg). Pass-rush specialist Pita Taumoepenu leads the conference with six sacks. Free safety Marcus Williams has a league-high four interceptions. USC has four picks as a team. Its 10 takeaways have come in clusters – four vs. Arkansas State, four vs. Arizona State. The Trojans desperately need someone other than linebackers Cameron Smith (team-leading 53 tackles) and Su’a Cravens (team-best 5.5 tackles for losses) to step up and make plays. USC’s defensive linemen have combined for only five sacks. The Trojans also have had a hard time stopping the run, which is an absolute must against Utah. EDGE: UTAH\nSPECIAL TEAMS\nUtah might have the best pair of specialists in the nation. Kicker Andy Phillips missed two field-goal attempts in Week 1 (from 48 and 46 yards); he is 9 for 10 since (with the lone miss from 48) and 50 of 61 (82 percent) for his career. Punter Tom Hackett leads the Pac-12 in gross average (48.0), and he excels at placing the ball (13 punts inside the 20-yard line, including 10 inside the 10). The Utes also have three return touchdowns. USC’s kick coverage was leakier than it had been against Notre Dame and obviously will have to be sharp this week. The Trojans also need to make sure their punt protection is sound after having one blocked (and returned for a touchdown) against the Fighting Irish. Jackson remains USC’s top return specialist, although JuJu Smith-Schuster also was involved on kickoff returns last week. EDGE: UTAH\nCOACHING\nMany Trojans fans are viewing this game as an audition for Utes coach Kyle Whittingham, who is considered a potential candidate for the USC opening. Whittingham’s résumé is impressive, including a 91-43 career record (15-4 since the start of 2014) and an 8-1 mark in bowl games. Whittingham generally gets the most out of his players. This year’s squad is No.1 in the Pac-12 in turnover margin (plus-12) and tied for second in penalty yards per game (38.2). USC is next to last in the latter (72.8), a trend that didn’t end when interim coach Clay Helton took over against Notre Dame (10 penalties for a season-high 105 yards). Helton has done everything he can think of to keep the Trojans together and in a positive frame of mind. He has said all the right things, and the Trojans played hard for him at Notre Dame. The work of defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox remains underwhelming. EDGE: UTAH\nINTANGIBLES\nThe oddsmakers in Las Vegas didn’t do the Trojans any favors this week by installing them as favorites. Now Whittingham can tell the Utes how much everyone is disrespecting them. It’s unclear how enthusiastic the Coliseum crowd will be in light of all the recent drama (and losses), but it’s better for USC to play there than in Salt Lake City. (The Trojans are 6-1 all time against the Utes in L.A.) USC should be more settled and focused now that it’s almost two weeks removed from the sudden dismissal of Steve Sarkisian. Although the Utes have a lot to play for – they’re in the driver’s seat in the Pac-12 South – the Trojans should be the more desperate team. Helton also can play up the payback motif after USC lost in the final seconds at Utah last October. EDGE: EVEN\nMATCHUP TO WATCH\nUtah’s defensive front seven vs. USC’s offensive line: The Trojans need to turn this game into a shootout. In order to do that, the offensive line has to open holes for the running backs and keep Kessler protected. However, the line won’t be at full strength. Already missing senior center Max Tuerk (Santa Margarita High), USC also could be without left tackle Chad Wheeler (concussion). Zach Banner, the usual starter at right tackle, has been working on the left side and has ample starting experience. Freshman right tackle Chuma Edoga has played a ton of snaps off the bench. But communication and cohesion are concerns with so much shuffling. Utah rotates four players at defensive end, including Kylie Fitts, who began his college career at UCLA. Kessler’s high school teammate at Centennial of Bakersfield, middle linebacker Jared Norris, leads Utah in solo tackles (23). He is one of nine Utes with two or more tackles for losses.\nPREDICTION: UTAH 30, USC 28\nUSC will have to play its best game – and Utah something less than that – in order for the Trojans to prevail. That would have been a shocking statement before the season, but that’s the state these two programs are in right now. Helton talked about USC having to win the battle at the line of scrimmage, which is true. But being physical in the trenches is Utah’s strength, not USC’s (at least to this point). This is a game in which Kessler has to play like the Heisman Trophy candidate he was purported to be before the season. He’s certainly capable of it. And having another weapon in Jackson playing offense almost exclusively should help. But playmaking on offense hasn’t been the Trojans’ problem. It’s stopping other teams, minimizing mistakes and playing tough – physically and mentally – for 60 minutes. USC hasn’t done any of the above consistently enough.\nMICHAEL LEV\nContact the writer: mlev@ocregister.com\nRelated: Disappointing USC hopes to kick-start second-half run vs. Utah USC midseason report: MVP, MIP, what lies ahead VIDEO: Previewing the USC-Utah game Utah quarterback and former San Clemente High standout Travis Wilson an unlikely hero Narrative for USC defense: Contain Utah tailback Devontae Booker", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/usc-688962-coach-trojans.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/jackson-688614-usc-game.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/usc/trojan-688800-usc-utah.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/usc/usc-688835-mvp-ahead.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/wilson-688616-utah-season.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:20:55.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
