We have it together now. We’ll be good.”\nBingham running back Javontay Smith\nSANDY — With their 34th consecutive win over Utah football teams, it may seem there isn’t much the top-ranked Bingham Miners need to prove.\nBut running back Javontay Smith said the Miner offense has felt a little more motivated to make a statement with their performance in Wednesday’s game against second-ranked Jordan.\n“We needed to prove something, that our offense wasn’t our weakest link,” Smith said after Bingham defeated Jordan 56-42. “We have it together now. We’ll be good.” The difference, he said, starts with the team’s offensive line.\n“Our O-line, the last three games, they’ve had an amazing game,” Smith said. “It’s incredible how they’ve improved from the last game to now.”\nIf the offense wanted to erase any doubt about its efficiency, the first quarter and a half were quite a statement.\nJordan’s opening drive ended on the Miner 12-yard line with a fumble recovered by Bingham’s Jay Tufele . That led to Bingham’s first touchdown — a 25-yard run by Smith.\nBingham’s defense held the Beetdiggers, and then Miners running back Brady Atkin scored on a 7-yard run. Mitchell’s extra point made it Bingham 14-0.\nIt took less than 20 seconds for the Miners to force the Beetdiggers to punt, which led to another touchdown by Smith, who scored on a 21-yard run at 8:06 in the second quarter.\nBut on the subsequent drive, the Beetdiggers finally found some offensive momentum. Senior quarterback Drew Lisk led a drive that combined passing with rushing as the Beetdiggers covered 80 yards that ended with a 1-yard run by Alec Evans . They scored a second touchdown, a 7-yard pass from Lisk to Jackson Bolingbroke with 7:22 left in the second quarter. Lisk would connect with three other receivers — Alika Tuia , Spencer Curtis and Isaiah Jackson — for touchdowns in the loss.\nBingham head coach John Lambourne said Jordan’s offensive momentum was just the flow of the game.\n“That’s the nature of their offense,” Lambourne said. “They figured a few things out, and that’s kind of the nature of our offense too. I was impressed with what they did, but I was happy with our guys too.”\nBingham’s running backs were effective running up the middle, but also on the outside as well. They used four backs in moving the ball on the ground — Smith, Elvis Vakapuna, Brady Atkin and Parker Taufa.\n“That was probably the most consistent effort we’ve had,” he said. “And that’s what we needed. I don’t know how many times we were stopped on a possession, but it wasn’t many. I can only think of a couple, but that’s a credit to our offensive line guys and then how hard our running backs were running. They broke a lot of tackles.”\nSmith and Atkin each scored two touchdowns, while Vakapuna and Taufa scored one.\n“We actually showed some new speed,” Lambourne said of his running backs. “We know they’re fast, but they haven’t broke out much. So we broke out and we had some good (runs).”\nAnd as impressive as Bingham’s offense was, the Miner defense was also pretty impressive.\n“Our D-line guysthey’re special kids,” he said. “You might get us here and there, but our guys are pretty good up there, which helps us on the back end.” Bingham had two fumble recoveries, including one by BJ Taufalele , where he picked up a bad snap and ran it about seven yards for a touchdown.\nEmail: adonaldson@deseretnews.com\nTwitter: adonsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:13:41.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
