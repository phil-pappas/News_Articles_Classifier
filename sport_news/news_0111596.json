RADIO: WBT-AM 1110 in Charlotte is flagship station (Mick Mixon play-by-play, Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke color analysts, Greg Brannon sideline reporter) LAST WEEK: Carolina – Bye week. Seattle – Lost at Cincinnati 24-27 in overtime. NEXT WEEK: Carolina – Hosts Philadelphia at 8:30 p.m. next Sunday. Seattle – Visits San Francisco at 4:25 p.m. next Sunday. THE SERIES: Seattle leads the all-time series 7-2, including five straight wins. Carolina’s last win came in December 2007 in Matt Moore’s debut as a starting quarterback. Charlotte’s record against Seattle isn’t the Panthers’ worst against NFL opponents – but it is close. Atlanta (24-16) has the most wins over Carolina, but the Panthers’ worst percentage is against two AFC teams – Buffalo and Pittsburgh. The Panthers are 1-5 against both franchises. RANKINGS AMONG NFL (After week 5): Carolina offense – 25 th overall, 4 th rushing, 29 th passing. Carolina defense – 10 th overall, 6 th rushing, 16 th passing. Seattle offense – 15 th overall, 1 st rushing, 26 th passing. Seattle defense – 5 th overall, 7 th rushing, 7 th passing. BY THE NUMBERS: 10 – Number of teams Cam Newton hasn’t beaten as a starting quarterback in his five-year NFL career, including a 0-4 record against Seattle. Other teams he’s failed to beat are Green Bay (0-2), Dallas (0-1), Tennessee (0-1), Denver (0-1), Kansas City (0-1), Pittsburgh (0-1), Baltimore (0-1), Buffalo (0-1) and Cincinnati (0-0-1). MATCHUP TO WATCH: Cam Newton against the Seattle Seahawks defense. During his five-year career, Newton has 89 touchdown passes and 56 interceptions. But in four games against the Seahawks – all losses – Newton has three touchdowns and three interceptions. NOTABLE: The Panthers are 0-5 after a bye week during Ron Rivera’s four-year coaching tenure, including a semifinal playoff loss to San Francisco in the 2013 season. Carolina is 8-12 all-time in the regular season following a bye and 1-2 in the playoffs…. Carolina has started 5-0 exactly once in franchise history – in the Super Bowl-losing year of 2003…. Since 2002, Seattle has the second-best home record in the NFC at 75-31. Green Bay (77-29-1) has the best record, with Minnesota third (67-39), Atlanta fourth (66-41) and Philadelphia fifth (63-43)…. Russell Wilson’s 38 quarterbacking victories in the first 53 games of his career is a NFL record. The previous record-holder was Baltimore Joe Flacco with 36 wins. Wilson also is 24-2 at home during that time frame…. Nine Seahawks have Carolinas connections – head coach Pete Carroll (defensive coordinator) and quarterbacks coach Carl Smith (offensive coordinator) were on Monte Kiffin’s N.C. State coaching staff in 1982, defensive line coach Travis Jones was on Jerry Moore’s Appalachian State coaching staff from 1998 to 2000, tight end Jimmy Graham is from Goldsboro, kicker Steven Hauschka went to N.C. State, tight end Cooper Helfet played at Duke, cornerback Tye Smith is from Raleigh, offensive guard J.R. Sweezy is from Mooresville and played at N.C. State and quarterback Russell Wilson played at N.C. State and also spent the summer of 2009 playing baseball for the Gastonia Grizzlies of the Coastal Plain League. PREDICTION: Carolina 17, Seattle 13 – Panthers have lost five straight times to the Seahawks, but a mistake-free game can turn the tables on a team that’s shown more vulnerability than it has in a long time.
