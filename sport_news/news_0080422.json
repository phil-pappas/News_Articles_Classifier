Mac-Hi’s earlier GOL victory also came at Baker’s expense, 10-0, on the Pioneers’ home field. “It was a little different match this time,” Mac-Hi coach Jose Garcia said. “We used different players. Four of our starters didn’t play because we were resting them.” Mac-Hi is now 2-3 in GOL play and 5-5-1 overall. The Pioneers host Ontario Saturday in their final league match and close out the regular season versus Riverside Tuesday in Hermiston in a non-leaguer. The top two teams in the GOL qualify for the Oregon Class 4A playoffs, and Garcia doubted his team could finish in the top two. However, the Pioneers still have a shot at an at-large berth based on state power rankings, he indicated. “That’s why the Riverside match is still an important one,” Garcia said. Miguel Rodriguez scored two of his four goals in the first half as Mac-Hi bolted to a 4-0 lead at the intermission. Adrian Martinez and Edgar Facio had the other two first-half goals. Rodriguez scored twice more in the second half and Facio, Kobee Carrillo and Jose Najera each added one goal. Mac-Hi goalkeeper Jesus Vela was credited with five saves. “With our passing and moving the ball around, it opened up a lot of goals for us,” Garcia added. “It went pretty smoothly.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:37:05.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
