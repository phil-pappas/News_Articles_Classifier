He was credited with six solo tackles and also batted down a pass at the line of scrimmage. \n\"With Aldon, I think a lot of people see what he's done over his career and think he's going to just bounce back in there,\" defensive end Justin Tuck said. \"He ain't had a training camp yet. It's kind of like he's had his training camp these first four games, and he's starting to get back to the Aldon of old, which is exciting. Hopefully for him he'll continue to grow, continue to grow in this defense. We expect great things from Aldon.\" \nSmith declined to speak to the media after the game and has kept a low profile since signing with the Raiders two days before the season opener. His role and impact have gradually grown, and he tallied his first sack when he took down Jay Cutler on the final play of the first half. \n\"We talk to each other during the game about making big plays,\" said wide receiver Michael Crabtree, his former teammate with the 49ers. \nSmith is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday for his August arrest on DUI, hit and run and vandalism charges. He figures to be subject to an NFL suspension at some point, although the arraignment likely won't have much impact on that as the NFL may be waiting to see how the legal process plays out with his case.

He got it retaped and eventually headed back to the locker room. By the start of the second half though, he returned to the game and caught four passes for 69 yards in the second half. He finished the day with team-leading totals of five receptions and 80 yards. \n\"I was scared,\" said Crabtree, who two years ago suffered a torn Achilles tendon in that right foot. \"I did everything I had to do to come back. It ain't nothing. I finished the game.\" \nCrabtree impressed quarterback Derek Carr by making it back into the game, and making an impact. \n\"It says a lot about what kind of guy he is, especially where we're at in that football game,\" Carr said. \nTJ Carrie started at safety again for the Raiders, but his day didn't last long. He left the game for good two plays before Crabtree was injured, going out after a 22-yard punt return. \nThe Raiders announced Carrie had a chest injury, and he had a sling on his left arm in the locker room after the game. \nThe Bears came into the game already down one starting offensive lineman with left tackle Jermon Bushrod out with a concussion and shoulder injury. San Leandro High product Charles Leno started in his place. \nOn the third play, they lost starting center Will Montgomery to a broken fibula. Left guard Matt Slauson moved over to center, and one of his snaps resulted in a second quarter fumble recovered by Oakland's Dan Williams to set up a Roy Helu Jr. touchdown reception that made it 14-6. \nTuck thought that overall, the loss of Montgomery might have hurt the Raiders by forcing Cutler to get the ball out quicker, which mitigated Oakland's pass rush. \n\"That might've hurried Cutler up more in his passes, which was not to my liking,\" Tuck said. \nSafety Charles Woodson's fourth-quarter interception was the 62nd of his career, tying him with Hall of Famer Dick Lebeau and Dave Brown for ninth on the all-time list. \nKicker Sebastian Janikowski played in his 240th game as a Raider, tying the franchise record set by Tim Brown. He'll likely break that mark next week at home against Denver. \nDenico Autry blocked Chicago kicker Robbie Gould's extra-point attempt in the first quarter, giving the Raiders two blocked PATs this season at the new 33-yard distance.
