Missouri won the game ... more > By JADE WASHBURN   \nColumbia, Mo. (AP) - South Carolina is 0-3 in Southeastern Conference play for the first time since Steve Spurrier’s first season as head coach in 2005. \nThe Gamecocks (2-3, 0-3) fell to Missouri (4-1, 1-1) 24-10 Saturday, giving the Tigers their first conference win. \n“Missouri outplayed us,” Spurrier said. “That’s all you can say. They played with no turnovers. They ran the ball better than us. Give those guys credit.” \nIt was the first time in SEC history that two true freshman quarterbacks started in the same game. \nLorenzo Nunez threw three interceptions in his second start for the Gamecocks, finishing 15 of 24 for 172 yards and a touchdown. He also led the team in rushing with 15 carries for 60 yards. \n“We wished he would have thrown those to a little different spot,” Spurrier said of Nunez’s interceptions. “We’ve got to get the ball to the open guy at the right time. We didn’t do that.” \nNunez’s only touchdown pass was nearly intercepted by Aarion Penton near the goal line, but bounced off his hands into the hands of Shon Carson, who crossed the plane for an 8-yard score. \nNunez’s play would be overshadowed by Missouri freshman quarterback Drew Lock. Lock started in place of Maty Mauk, who was suspended Tuesday for violating team policies. He completed 21 of 28 passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns, and became the first freshman to start at quarterback for Missouri since Corby Jones in 1995. \nMissouri coach Gary Pinkel was pleased with Lock’s debut as a starter. \n“Drew really did some good things for a young player,” Pinkel said. “I thought he really carried himself well.” \nPharoh Cooper led the Gamecocks in receiving with nine catches for 102 yards. David Williams had nine rushes for 40 yards, but South Carolina was limited to just 5 yards rushing in the first half. \n“The only thing we had was Lorenzo,” Spurrier said of the Gamecocks’ run game. “It’s a huge difference when you can’t run the ball in. We’re struggling doing that.” \nMissouri captains Kenya Dennis and Ian Simon recorded their first interceptions of the season, as did defensive end Walter Brady. Brady also had two sacks, both on third down. \n“Turnovers are what really lost us the game,” Cooper said. “We cannot have turnovers every possession we have.” \nCooper said the interceptions affected Nunez’s psyche.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T02:36:36.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
