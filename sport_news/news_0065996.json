It ranks fourth in points per game. \nOffensive coordinator Hue Jackson produced five straight games with at least 389 net offensive yards. This marks only the second time in franchise history for such a streak. The last came in 1986. \nYet, despite all this success, the running game lining up in the I-formation with Jeremy Hill powering behind has yet to make any true impact. That's right, what was universally thought to be the key to the Bengals success this season flailed through the first five weeks and this team's offense reached almost unprecedented heights. \nThat's not because of abandoning the run game. Actually, they rank third in the NFL in rushing attempts per game. For that, they can thank Giovani Bernard. \nHe's carried 69 times for 377 yards. That's 5.5 yards per rush. His rushes up the middle with the Seattle defense spread against three wide receivers and Tyler Eifert on the field served a major role in the 17-point comeback Sunday against Seattle. Bengals' best, worst from Sunday \nHis success shows the the versatility of the Bengals running game. \n\"The guy is playing his tail off,\" Jackson said. \"I never said it was going to look exactly the same as it did last year. But I know we have to run the ball. And we will continue to run the ball. We're not ever going to shy away from that. We can run the ball better. But how we run it, whether it's two backs, one back, six backs, I don't care, we'll find a way.\" \nA stable of offensive weapons allows it. The problem has been the inability to get Jeremy Hill started. After leading the NFL in rushing the final nine weeks of last season, he's averaging three yards per carry. He was a forgotten man Sunday, carrying eight times for 13 yards and only taking 22 percent of the snaps. \nThe man who led the way for Hill's ascension last year, fullback Ryan Hewitt, also only took 22 percent of the snaps. That's not coincidence. Lining up in the I-formation and pounding the football downhill means taking Mohamed Sanu, Marvin Jones or maybe Tyler Eifert off the field. \nGetting 15 rushes for 80 yards from Bernard allows them to still run the ball while keeping all passing weapons on the field. \n\"We have all types of players that can fit into really any offense,\" Bernard said. \"We've done a good job of it all season. Whatever Hue gives us we just go out there and perform it. That's what I really know about this offense is that guys just go with the flow and make plays.\" \nHill patiently waits for his. In the eyes of his teammates and coordinator, part of his lacking success comes due to circumstance. The Bengals played a series of teams dedicated to – and very good at – stopping the run. Only San Diego ranks outside the top half of the league in rushing yards allowed per play. Meanwhile, Seattle (fourth), Oakland (fifth) and Baltimore (sixth) all live in the top 10. Buffalo will present the same concern. They boast a disruptive front seven and rank 10th in rushing yards allowed per play. \nHill's time will come, Jackson says. The coordinator is sticking by his second-year back. \n\"Jeremy hasn't had the success that he had a year ago, and I think that's what everybody's looking for,\" Jackson said of his back who averaged 5.1 yards per carry last year. \"But Jeremy's playing and playing well. Jeremy's still our starting tailback. Everybody has seen over the last couple games that Gio has got more carries, more opportunities than Jeremy. Well, eventually that's going to flip. \n\"I'm just being very honest with you guys. Eventually it will. It's not going to stay the same and it's not going to keep happening like it's happening. That's just people you play, defenses you face, opportunities come up and you've got to make the most of them, and that's what Gio has done.\" 6 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1RDlM66 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:12:29.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
