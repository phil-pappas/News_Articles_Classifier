Cook replaced Joe Hubener at quarterback late in the second quarter. Related \nIt was so bad in the end that only a few fans even stayed in Bill Snyder Family Stadium to watch 19th-ranked Oklahoma finish a historic 55-0 drubbing of the Wildcats. \nKansas State’s third-quarter problem became a four-quarter disaster on Saturday. \nIt was so bad in the end that only a few fans even stayed in Bill Snyder Family Stadium to watch 19th-ranked Oklahoma finish a historic 55-0 drubbing of the Wildcats. \nThe embarrassing loss snapped a streak of 234 games without being shut out, dating back to 1996 when current OU defensive coordinator Mike Stoops was still an assistant at K-State. It was also the first time the Wildcats have been blanked at home since 1991, marking the worst under head coach Bill Snyder. \n“I think all of us are embarrassed,” Snyder said. “I can’t remember being involved in a game like this since 1989 — the first year we were here. And I don’t know that we had one that bad in the first go-around. \n“I’m not smart enough to put my finger on it. I feel badly for the guys in the locker room, we just weren’t prepared to play and it’s more than just the emotional preparation as well. We all share in it, my responsibility.” \nLosers of three straight now, the Wildcats didn’t even crack 100 yards of total offense until their final possession of the game with less than a minute to go — finishing with 110. K-State (3-3, 0-3 Big 12) turned the ball over three times, rushed for just 65 yards, passed for only 45 and surrendered 568 yards of offense to a Sooners team that led 35-0 at halftime. \n“Once again, how are you going to respond?” Snyder said. “It’s one of those things that happens in life — you either cash it in or make something positive out of it in regards to motivation to improve and become better and play with greater spirit and to do a better job of coaching.” \nThere’s plenty to improve upon after Saturday. The only problem is knowing exactly where the Wildcats should start. \nA week ago, K-State had second-ranked TCU on the ropes before blowing a second-half lead and losing by seven. A week before that, K-State blew a late lead at Oklahoma State, only to lose by two. \nThen on Saturday, the wheels fell off. \nK-State quarterback Joe Hubener didn’t make it out of the first half before he was benched for receiver Kody Cook. Hubener completed just 4 of 12 passes for 39 yards with two interceptions in the first half, while being sacked twice. Though he returned to the game in the fourth quarter, he didn’t do much better, misfiring on two passes. \nCook wasn’t the answer on Saturday, either, though, as he was only 1 for 8 for 6 yards with an interception, while rushing for 19 yards on 11 carries. For what its worth, Cook was K-State’s leading receiver on the day with two catches for 38 yards. \n“We had less than 100 yards of offense, so we had to try something,” Snyder said. “And Kody performed quite well in his previous stints there. We had to do something. We didn’t have a lot of other guys to go to.” \nNobody ran the ball well for the Wildcats all day. Running backs Charles Jones and Justin Silmon combined for just 21 yards on eight carries. \nOklahoma (5-1, 2-1) jumped on K-State early and often and never let up. The Sooners charged out to a quick 7-0 lead on a 22-yard touchdown pass from Baker Mayfield to Sterling Shepard to cap a speedy five-play, 75-yard drive that took just 1:04 off the clock. \nK-State punted after three straight passes that netted 1 total yard and then forced OU into one of its two punts on the day. \nIt was short-lived success, though. Hubener’s pass on first down was incomplete, followed by a 2-yard loss on second down and then his third interception of the season on third down, which was returned 24 yards to the K-State 16. \nTwo plays later, OU was back in the end zone to make it 14-0 after a 10-yard TD pass from Mayfield to running back Joe Mixon with 8:33 to play in the opening quarter. \nMayfield connected with Shepard again three minutes into the second quarter to make it 21-0 — this time from 28 yards out — sandwiched around a missed 32-yard field goal attempt by Jack Cantele that was wide right. \nThe Sooner quarterback was just getting started, as Mayfield finished with a career-high five touchdown passes — all in the first half — to go with his 282 passing yards for the game. The Texas Tech transfer completed a 3-yard TD pass to Mark Andrews with 7:29 to go in the second quarter and a 4-yard TD pass to Dede Westbrook with 4:59 remaining in the half to make it 35-0. \nOklahoma cruised the rest of the way after Mayfield staked the Sooners to the big first-half lead — getting a pair of field goals from Austin Seibert, a 38-yard interception return for a touchdown by Zack Sanchez and a touchdown run by Mixon to cap the day’s scoring. \nK-State’s offensive strategy came as a surprise to the Sooners, who allowed the Longhorns to rush for 313 yards a week ago. The Wildcats took a different approach — the opposite one, in fact — by throwing on nearly every down to start the game. A K-State running back didn’t record a carry in the game until the 2:57 mark of the first quarter — after the Wildcats were trailing 14-0. \n“I’m not a game-planner, but if you saw the game last week, I would have run the ball,” OU defensive end Matt Dimon said. “That’s what we thought they were going to do, but they came out slinging it — they had the wind. I didn’t get a run block until the eighth or ninth play. It was surprising, but I’ll take what they give us.” \nWhen asked about the strategy to come out passing, Snyder didn’t say much. \n“That was what the coaches thought we could do, so that’s what we tried to do,” he said. \nCook said Saturday’s outcome was disappointing because the Wildcats have shown the ability to be a better team in recent weeks. \n“You’re angry and its frustrating,” he said. “Obviously, we didn’t expect to get shut out. We thought we had a good game plan — we just didn’t play to what we’re capable of. You’ve seen us the past couple of weeks, we’re capable of putting points on the board. \n“We just didn’t take care of business.” \nThe Wildcats will have another chance to take care of their business next week when they travel to Austin, Texas, to face the Longhorns in an 11 a.m. kickoff on Fox Sports 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:18:26.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
