(CHRIS KNIGHT / MORNING CALL FILE PHOTO) Keith Groller Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call \nWhen the leaves start to change in the fall, football teams often reveal their true colors. \nBecause the seven Patriot League members often have contrasting nonleague schedules, it's hard to get an accurate barometer on where they're at and where they're headed. \nBut as league play begins in earnest on Saturday with Bucknell, Lehigh and Georgetown making their league debuts, it's not a bad time to check around the league — at least outside the Lehigh Valley — and see where the league trophy and automatic FCS playoff berth could be headed. \nBUCKNELL — The Bison, who host Lehigh on Saturday, have played close games and found a way to win three of four. They are No. 1 in the league in scoring, rushing and total defense. They have yet to get their offense in gear, however, averaging just 313.2 yards per game and have thrown more interceptions (5) than TD passes (3). Turnovers have been an issue overall as indicated by a minus-5 ratio. However, the defense gets after quarterbacks (3.0 sacks per game) and is especially stingy on third downs. \nCOLGATE — The Raiders have rebounded from a difficult three-game stretch to start the season (Navy, New Hampshire and Yale) to post wins in their last two games. They have one more nonleague game (at Princeton Saturday) before having five consecutive league games, including Lafayette and Lehigh and on back-to-back Saturdays in November. Junior Jake Melville has become a dual threat at quarterback and the Raiders have three of the top six rushers in the league. Not surprisingly, Colgate leads the league in rushing with over 200 yards on the ground per game and also is tops in time of possession (33:41 per game). \nFORDHAM — The defending champion Rams have lived up to their preseason billing and lead the league in scoring offense thanks in large part to sophomore Chase Edmonds, who is averaging 130.8 yards per game on the ground and is coming off a career-best 234 yards against Lafayette. Quarterback Kevin Anderson has thrown for 13 touchdowns and 273.2 yards per game. The Rams are also second in the league in total defense and have recorded a league-best 14 sacks — five by Niko Thorpe. \nGEORGETOWN — The Hoyas, who host Lafayette on Saturday, have been on a lose-one, win-one pattern. They are last in the league in total offense (288.4 yards per game). Georgetown has no one averaging more than 45 yards per game rushing, but quarterback Kyle Nolan has thrown for 979 yards and five touchdowns. Senior Jake DeCicco is averaging just under six catches per game. Senior linebacker Matt Satchell is averaging 10 tackles per game, kick returner Isaac Ellsworth is averaging 22.6 yards per return and beware of a defensive secondary that has had five interceptions and returned two of them for touchdowns. \nHOLY CROSS — The Crusaders, who host Brown this week and must play 10 straight weeks thanks to a Week 2 bye, rebounded nicely from a 31-14 loss to Colgate with a 37-0 win over Albany. Junior quarterback Peter Pujals is the key to the offense. He is third in the league in total offense (241 yards per game) and has his team second in the league in scoring offense (26 points per game). Junior Brendan Flaherty leads the league with 8.2 catches per game and has four TD catches. The Crusaders are also No. 1 in pass defense, allowing just 165.2 yards per game, but they have just three interceptions and six sacks. \nDID YOU KNOW? \nThe Patriot League's weekly release revealed something interesting about the matchups involving Lehigh and Lafayette this weekend. The Lehigh-Bucknell series generally produces blowouts. The last 13 games between the Mountain Hawks and Bison have been decided by 16 points or more. And 11 of them were decided by 20 or more, including the Bison's 48-10 and 45-24 wins the past two years. The Lafayette-Georgetown series has been much tighter. Of the last five meetings, four have been decided by four points or less. The one blowout in the mix was a 45-27 Leopards win in Washington in 2013. \nPATRIOT LEAGUE STANDINGS \nTeam, PL, All, PF, PA, Streak \nFordham, 1-0, 4-1, 177, 111, W3 \nColgate, 1-0, 2-3, 105, 138, W2 \nBucknell, 0-0, 3-1, 71, 62, W2 \nGeorgetown, 0-0, 2-3, 88, 147, L1 \nLehigh, 0-0, 2-3, 117, 169, L2 \nHoly Cross, 0-1, 2-2, 104, 79, W1 \nLafayette, 0-1, 1-4, 65, 152, L1 \nLAST WEEK'S RESULTS \nHoly Cross 37, Albany 0 \nBucknell 28, VMI 22 (OT) \nYale 27, Lehigh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:09:25.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
