He has one year remaining on his existing deal. However, Mattingly turned down the new deal, per the report. \nMattingly led the Dodgers to three straight playoff appearances but the team's total payroll over those seasons was $800 million. \nThe Dodgers lost in the first round of the playoffs in 2014 and 2015. \nA year ago, the failure was almost identical and the front office was overhauled as a result. There are likely to be even more significant changes this winter as Friedman continues to implement his vision. \nAfter being eliminated by the Mets, first baseman Adrian Gonzalez was asked if he had confidence the same group of Dodgers could finally get over the hump in 2016. \n\"If this is the exact same team next year, yeah,\" he said. \"But I doubt it's going to be the exact same team.\" \nThe Dodgers won just one playoff series in those three postseasons under Mattingly's leadership (the 2013 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves). \nThe Dodgers' shortcomings in 2015 -- a rotation that dropped off severely behind Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke, a thin bullpen and an offense that ran hot and cold -- were not necessarily Mattingly's fault. \nYet, the Friedman-led front office showed no hesitation to move players either and that figures to happen again this offseason. \nMost prominently, Greinke can exercise an opt-out clause in his contract and become a free agent. Greinke, a NL Cy Young Award candidate, would be forfeiting the final three years and $71 million of his deal with the Dodgers. On the free agent market, however, he would almost certainly be able to double the total amount. \nThe Dodgers would have a large void to fill in an already thin starting rotation if Greinke leaves. \nChanges are also likely in the infield where veteran second baseman Howie Kendrick and shortstop Jimmy Rollins will be free agents but young shortstop Corey Seager is poised to step in after an impressive showing in September and second baseman Jose Peraza was acquired from the Braves. \n\"It's going to be a long offseason, figuring out personal stuff and team stuff,\" outfielder Andre Ethier acknowledged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:56:56.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
