Birney Crum Stadium. \nFirst, the Viking junior running back put his team ahead 21-0. \nSecond, the play was part of a sequence that probably marked the point of no return as far as the Blue Eagles’ chance for a win went. \nAnd third, it served as a human silencer. \n“(Nazareth) had been talking trash about us all week,” Ferrell said. “We heard it all week.” \nThe only thing heard at the end of Ferrell’s decisive run was the roaring of Central’s delighted Homecoming crowd. \nThe play was a speed sweep designed to take advantage of Ferrell’s ability to outrun defenders even if they had angles on him. \n“We’ve been working all fall on setting up the blocking for that play,” said Ferrell, who wound up with 91 yards on four carries, said. “That’s my first big one, my first big run like that.” \nIt wasn’t just big – it was huge. \nThe Vikings (4-2, 3-2 EPC South) led 14-0 and had just stopped a Nazareth drive thanks to a Tom Murphy interception. \nFerrell’s epic run followed on the next play and Central Catholic rode that momentum the rest of the way. \n“It was a really, really good feeling running alone to the end zone,” Ferrell said. “Once I saw Alvin hit his lead block, I knew I was gone.” \nAlvin? Senior Alvin Pacheco , he of the 234 yards and four touchdowns Saturday? Blocking? \n“They block for me,” Pacheco said. “I block for them.” \nNo one wonder Ferrell, Pacheco and the rest of the Vikings accomplished what they did Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:26:27.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
