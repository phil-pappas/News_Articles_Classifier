We’ve been ahead in games and not been able to finish it off. \n“You learn from that, and experience comes from that.” \nTo that end, the role of the Wallabies’ bench “finishers” will be even more important than usual, with the likes of Beale, Ben McCalman, Nick Phipps and the replacement front row expected to come on and either ice the game – or rip it from Welsh hands. \nMcCalman may feel aggrieved at again being handed a finisher role despite the one-game suspension of vice-captain Michael Hooper opening up a spot in the starting back-row. \nCheika instead opted for hard-charging young gun Sean McMahon, who has played just six Tests but won man-of-the-match honours in his past two. \nMcMahon’s selection causes the least disruption to the Wallabies’ ongoing selection, with David Pocock allowed to continue his fine progression in the No.8 role – instead of being moved back to No.7, which would’ve been likely had McCalman started. \nRob Simmons is another entrusted with a key finishing role, having been dumped as the team’s main lineout caller for Dean Mumm, who impressed off the bench against Fiji and England, captained the victory over Uruguay and has the most lineout steals this tournament. \n“I think we’ve got a big influence this weekend in what the finishers can do but it’s as big as what the foundations were by those who came before,” said Mumm, who starts at lock alongside Kane Douglas. \n“You go about it in a way that the game is there to be won then you come home with a strong bench. \n“I do think we have a very strong bench, people who can influence a game. \n“Then it’s about making sure that can happen and that has happened in previous games to (put) those guys in that position to have the influence.” \nTeams: \nAustralia: Israel Folau, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, David Pocock, Sean McMahon, Scott Fardy, Dean Mumm, Kane Douglas, Sekope Kepu, Stephen Moore (capt), Scott Sio.
