Of course, the higher-ranked kid on that squad was Greg Oden, the top recruit in the country and the eventual No. 1-overall pick in the 2007 draft. \nMonday night, though, Conley was back in Columbus, as the Grizzlies took on the Cavaliers in an exhibition game at the Ohio State campus. And for Conley, it was comforting to be back. \nFrom Adam Jarby of the Columbus Dispatch : Conley, wearing a protective mask after suffering broken bones around his left eye during the first round of last season’s playoffs, had nine assists and missed his three attempts from the field, finishing with four points on free throws. “It felt good to just see the crowd, look down at the court and look at something familiar,” Conley said. “It was cool to see the response the crowd gave me during the starting lineups. It was just a fun environment.” \nConley averaged 11.3 points and 6.1 assists per game during his sole season at Ohio State, a year in which he helped the Buckeyes to a National Championship Game appearance. OSU eventually fell to Florida in the final game of the year. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
