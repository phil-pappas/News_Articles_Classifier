It shall be interesting as conventional wisdom suggests the young college stud should get 75% of the starts, which could/should/would prompt Ramo to eventually ask for a European assignment instead. Then again, he may even be back here again.\nFlames head coach Bob Hartley is still at least one game away from trying to shake things up in net as he insists on starting Jonas Hiller over Joni Ortio Friday against the Detroit Red Wings.\nWe will undoubtedly see Ortio make his season debut on the Flames' tough three-game road trip to New York, Brooklyn and Ottawa.\nThe Dougie Hamilton Experience sure hasn't lived up to the hype as of yet, prompting Hartley to rightfully switch up his blueline pairings to Mark Giordano/Dennis Wideman, Kris Russell/Deryk Engelland and Hamilton with either Ladislav Smid or call-up Jakub Nakladal.\nThey sorely miss T.J. Brodie, who will make the trip and potentially suit up after breaking his hand in the preseason.\nMake no mistake, the whole \"sky is falling\" attitude most fans in this city have is completely warranted given how important a good start is and how horrifically outplayed the Flames have been.\nThe work ethic that was the team's calling card isn't there and the breakdowns are stunningly constant.\nWith concerns the season is already in jeopardy, you will start to hear more and more trade rumours as the notoriously hard-working Treliving contemplates doing what he can to help get things back on track.\nFact is, the answer lies in the dressing room with the lads who are capable of so much more.\nStill, talk of trading Wideman to potentially open up money to sign Russell will persist as will speculation about the future of Jiri Hudler, who can't possibly be here next year given his pricetag will be in the $7-million range thanks to an eighth-place finish in NHL scoring last year.\nIf things continue to slide here, you can bet \"Huds\" will be traded before the trade deadline.\nSportsnet's Mark Spector sure stirred the pot by suggesting Treliving and Tampa Bay Lightning GM Steve Yzerman have had talks about pending free agent Steve Stamkos, prompting many to start piecing together fantasy trades involving the Lightning ace for Wideman, Hudler, Sam Bennett or even Sean Monahan.\nThe inordinate number of scouts at recent Flames games only fuels the fire.\nPerhaps we got a glimpse of the future as Hartley made the rare move of taking Hudler off the top line Tuesday to see how Michael Frolik fared alongside Johnny Gaudreau and Monahan.\nFrolik has been rock solid, as advertised.\nBennett has not, and neither has Micheal Ferland.\nIt is early and there's little doubt those two youngsters will get better, as will the rest of the team.\nFrankly, things couldn't really get much worse around here.\nOr could they?\neric.francis@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/EricFrancis\nFlames\nSlow start has Calgary Flames shuffling the deck in search of a spark\nBy Eric Francis , Calgary Sun First posted: Thursday, October 22, 2015 06:54 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 22, 2015 11:19 PM EDT\nThis is what happens when you open the season with one win in six outings.\nThis is what follows when you allow twice as many goals as you score to follow up a year of unforeseen momentum with embarrassing efforts in front of the hometown crowd.\nFans start to grovel, the media start to finger-point, players get on edge and things start to snowball.\nRumours start to fly.\nManagement did its part to try breaking the cycle following the Calgary Flames' fourth-straight loss at the Dome by putting goalie Karri Ramo on waivers Tuesday.
