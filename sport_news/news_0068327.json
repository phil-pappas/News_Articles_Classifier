(AP) — The Big South Conference is relocating its basketball tournaments that were held at Coastal Carolina, which announced earlier this year it is leaving the league to join the Sun Belt Conference next July. \nThe Big South has also removed its baseball and outdoor track and field championships from the Grand Strand area. The league said in a statement its bylaws state members leaving with less than two years notice are not eligible to host championships. \nThe release said the men's and women's tournaments will be split into separate events — the men playing March 3-6 and the women the following week — and interested hosts can bid on them. \nThe league expects a decision on the new location early next month. \nCoastal Carolina held the tournaments the past three years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:14:38.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
