Joe Thornton tried to set him up on the power play, and Joe Pavelski tried to find him on an odd-man rush late in Saturday's game with an empty net in front of them. \nFinally with 56.1 seconds left in third period, Ward got his third goal. He took a pass from Brent Burns and scored into the empty net to put the finishing touches on a 5-2 win over the Carolina Hurricanes at SAP Center before an announced crowd of 15,814, the smallest paid attendance for a Sharks game in over nine years. \nWard has five goals on the season, and all have come in the last four games. He now has a team-high eight points. \nPavelski and Tommy Wingels added one goal each as San Jose snapped a three-game losing streak. \nWard's first goal was set up by a pretty play from Tomas Hertl, who carried the puck across the blue line, passed to himself around Carolina defenseman Noah Hanifin and got a shot on goal. Patrick Marleau had a whack at it before Ward cashed in the chance to give San Jose a 1-0 lead just 1:21 into the first period. \nWard scored later in the first on a 2 on 1 with Marleau, as he kept the puck and fired a wrist shot past Hurricanes goalie Eddie Lack with 11:28 left in the first. \nPavelski got behind Hurricanes defensemen Justin Faulk and Ron Hainsey to help give the Sharks a 3-1 lead. Marc-Edouard Vlasic banked a shot from the blue line off the end boards, the puck came in front and got between Lack's legs, where Pavelski got a stick on it for this third goal of the season. Advertisement \nWingels scored his first of the season, as he followed up his own shot to give the Sharks a 4-1 lead with 10:51 to go in the second. That chased Lack, who allowed four goals on 13 shots. Cam Ward finished the game for the Hurricanes. \nThe Sharks entered Saturday with just one goal in their last seven periods, which was by Ward on Thursday against the Los Angeles Kings. San Jose was also 1-4-1 against the Hurricanes since the start of the 2010-11 season. \nCarolina entered the night with two goals in three games and 12 in seven to start the season. \nDefenseman Paul Martin returned to the Sharks lineup Saturday and had 15:03 of ice time through two periods. The Sharks have lost all three games that Martin has missed, as he suffered a lower body injury Oct. 16 against the New Jersey Devils. \nMartin was back with defensive partner Burns as the Sharks played the second game of a three-game homestand. \n\"I feel really good right now, and I think it's gotten better every day,\" Martin said Saturday morning. \"I've been through this process before where I think I'm good enough to play.\" \nThe other defensive pairs for the Sharks were the same as before Martin's injury, as Vlasic was with Justin Braun and Brenden Dillon played alongside Matt Tennyson. \nThe last time the Sharks announced a crowd below 16,000 was March 30, 2006, when the announced attendance was 15,681 to see San Jose play the Phoenix Coyotes. The smallest crowd that season was 15,226, which came Feb. 2, 2006 against Minnesota. \nThe Sharks had a sellout crowd of 17,562 for their Oct. 10 home opener against the Anaheim Ducks. For Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Kings, the announced attendance was 16,797. \nThe Sharks sold out 205 straight games from Dec. 2009 to Oct. 25 of last season, which included 177 regular season games and 28 in the playoffs. \nAfter the Sharks missed the 2015 playoffs, about 85 percent of season ticket holders renewed for this season, Sharks chief operating officer John Tortora said in September. \nThe Sharks recalled forward John McCarthy from the Barracuda of the AHL. McCarthy was the fourth line with Mike Brown and center Bryan Lerg. Forwards Ben Smith (ear laceration) and Joonas Donksoi (lower body) did not play Saturday. Defenseman Mirco Mueller was a healthy scratch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:27:58.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
