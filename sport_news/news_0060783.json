Hockey was finally back in Northern Colorado and the Colorado Eagles were prepared to open their season with a booming start at the Budweiser Events Center in front of their fans following a strong training camp and preseason. However, Utah wasn't in the mood to play along with the plans for a happy beginning and sent the Eagles into the night with a frustrating end with a 4-3 overtime win. \"Yeah, in front of your fans like tonight, you want to come out and get the first win,” Eagles forward Kyle Ostrow said. “The good thing is we get another chance (Saturday), so we need to come more prepared.” Giffen Nyren To make matter worse, Colorado didn't do itself any favors, providing the Grizzlies with four power-play chances on the night (they converted two of them) and the Eagles missed a bevy of opportunities to tickle the twine. But worst of all was in overtime after drawing a 4-on-3 man advantage and failing to score, later turning the puck over, leading to the Grizzlies' game-winner on a breakaway with 48 second remaining in the extra period. Ostrow gave the Eagles a glimmer of hope, equalizing with 27 second left in regulation when a rebound trickled to his stick and he shoveled it home to send the crowd into a frenzy. Escaping with an unlikely win seemed possible when new ECHL overtime rules started the OT with 3-on-3 hockey and Utah took a penalty in the opening minute to provide Colorado with a power play, having already scored two man-advantage goals in the game. After several intense moments that could have ended the game and supplied Colorado with the dramatic victory, a turnover leaked out to center ice, scooped up by Utah forward Josh MacDonald, who sent the puck 5-hole for the winner, his second goal of the night. “I think we were really confident, especially gaining the power play like we did. We had our opportunities, we just didn't put it in the net,” Ostrow said. “Sure enough, you give up one opportunity and they capitalized. It's a game of opportunities and we didn't take ours.” Utah gave itself an insurance goal it turned out it would need just 29 seconds into the final frame, sending a wave of silence over the BEC. Despite the dire-looking circumstances, Colorado didn't go quietly. Captain Trent Daavettila fired what appeared to be a tying goal off the crossbar, followed less than a minute later with a puck off Utah's post. The Eagles threw every body they could in front of net to create havoc in hopes tying, eventually culminating in Ostrow's heroics. The second period was plagued by mental errors from the Eagles, taking a pair of penalties and surrendering goals to Utah on both occasions. But it wasn't on one end of the ice where they failed to play sharply. Colorado missed several scoring chances around a crowded Grizzlies crease, putting Utah goaltender Ryan Faragher into scramble mode, yet never seizing the moments he spent writhing on his back or stomach. Utah set the tone for the second 1:31 into the period when a Drayson Bowman hooking penalty set the Grizzlies up with a quick power play. It took just 30 seconds for Utah to turn the chance into an equalizing goal with a beautiful cross-slot pass from forward Ryan Walters to MacDonald, who fired the puck past Eagles netminder Jacob DeSerres. Seven minutes later, the Grizzlies jumped out to their first lead of the game on the man advantage once more, utilizing a nearly identical play on a pass across the slot, which defenseman Andrew O'Brien received for a 2-1 Utah edge. “Our penalty killing wasn't workin' the way it should have, and that's because we haven't worked on it; we just haven't spent enough time on it,” Colorado coach Chris Stewart said. “It was lackluster to say the least and the penalties we took started with some yapping and getting the referee against us, and it worked against us until we got through the third period. That second period was one where we shot ourselves in the foot.” It was a disappointing 9-minute lapse for Colorado, which owned the puck and time in the offensive zone throughout the opening period. The Eagles found the back of the net initially on their first and only power play of the first two frames, supplying them and their fans plenty to cheer about in the season opener. Defenseman Jake Marto slung a shot on net midway through the first and a rebound slipped to Faragher's right to the tape of Colorado forward Jesse Mychan, flipping the puck home for the Eagles' first goal of the new campaign. For most of the night, offense boiled down to almosts and what ifs. “There were four wide-open nets where pucks would have been easy to just put it in and we didn't have that killer instinct,” Stewart said. “Playing with desperation, even in Game 1, is something that you want to instill because when you get to Game 72, you have to have that.” Colorado faces the Grizzlies in its own building once more Saturday (7:05 p.m.) to close out the two-game opening series looking for a split before hosting Allen on Wednesday and traveling to Rapid City on Oct. 24.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:04:23.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
