This week, he is charged with obliterating the prospect of the greatest day in his country’s rugby history. \nLedesma, one of the game’s greatest hookers who helped Argentina reach new heights at four World Cups, is now transforming Australia’s pack as the coach of the vastly improved Wallabies’ scrum. \nOn Sunday, the popular Ledesma’s Australian charges face their most demanding Test yet against the team whose reputation for scrummaging prowess was so greatly enhanced by the flinty 42-year-old from Buenos Aires. \nAustralia coach Michael Cheika understands that the Twickenham semi-final is bound to be a strangely conflicting experience for such a passionate servant of Argentine rugby. \nBut he also knows it will not stop Ledesma from continuing to put “120 per cent” into the Wallabies team he has learnt to love in the past year. Either way, it will probably end in tears for “Super Mario”. \n“It’s very special for Mario,” Cheika said with a smile. “It’s obviously a big game for him. \n“I remember when we went to Mendoza to play Argentina in the Rugby Championship, and we were walking up the stairs before the match, and I said to him, ‘Are you going to sing your country’s anthem?’ And he wasn’t sure if he was allowed to or not. \n“I said, ‘Of course, that’s your heritage’ and I want him to love that. But I know he loves this team, and he’ll do anything he possibly can this week to make sure this team is in the best possible spot, going forward.” \nCheika also enthused about a man who “always does his job to the maximum and gives 120 per cent each time that he is with the team”.
