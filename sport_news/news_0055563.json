Backup Mike Vick suffered a strained right hamstring in last Sunday’s 25-13 victory against the Arizona Cardinals. \n“I think it’s prudent and appropriate right now to operate under the assumption that Landry is our quarterback this week,” Tomlin said. “He is the guy that’s healthy.” \nJones had been the third-string quarterback since being drafted in the fourth round in 2013. He played well against the Cardinals, completing 8-of-12 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns. \n“We were not shocked by his performance, but we were pleased by it,” Tomlin said. \nThe Steelers (4-2) have gone 2-1 without Roethlisberger. However, Vick has struggled, completing 40-of-66 passes for 371 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. \nOffensive coordinator Todd Haley called more low-risk plays for Vick, who signed as a free agent at the end of the preseason when backup quarterback Bruce Gradkowski was placed on injured reserve with a hand injury. \nThe Steelers, though, will likely open up the offense more if Jones starts. He had extensive action in the preseason as played five games rather than the normal four because of the Steelers appearance in the Hall of Fame game. \n“He took advantage of those reps, like we all talked about during the course of the preseason, but regular season is different from the preseason,” Tomlin said. \nWhile injuries have left Jones as the only healthy quarterback on the roster, Tomlin said the Steelers have not worked out any free agents. \nThey could promote rookie wide receiver Tyler Murphy from the practice squad as he played quarterback at Boston College. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:32:38.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
