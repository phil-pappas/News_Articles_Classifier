Is it the number of All-Star selections? Is it the numbers they put up on a yearly basis? Or, does it boil down to wins and championships? If you're part of the latter group, then you and the Rockets ' Ty Lawson have something in common.\nCurrently, the Western Conference features a talented group of point guards, including Lawson, Tony Parker , Russell Westbrook , Rajon Rondo , Eric Bledsoe , Chris Paul , Mike Conley , and Steph Curry . Just to name a few. But, in Lawson's eyes, there's a clear way to determine which ones are good and which ones should be considered among the elite.\nPer Yahoo Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski :\n\"I don’t think you’ve ever seen so many good point guards in one conference at one time in the league ever,” Lawson told Yahoo Sports. “But you’ve got to win. If you want to be an elite PG in this league, you’ve got to win. You’ve got to be in the conference finals, the NBA Finals. If you’re not winning, you’ll always be a second-tier, or third-tier point guard.”\nIf this is true, then we shouldn't consider Paul elite, even though he is a eight-time All-Star, four-time All-NBA First Team and has led the league in assists four times. Is CP3 an exception to the \"rule\"? Or, does Lawson have a point in his argument? Let us know your thoughts.\n[via NBC Sports ]", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/news/refreshed-and-recharged--ty-lawson-is-taking-aim-at-steph-curry-and-the-nba-s-elite-221658404.html", "http://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/10/05/ty-lawson-implies-chris-paul-isnt-elite/"], "published": "2015-10-06T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:29:15.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
