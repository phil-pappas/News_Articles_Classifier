Kevin Harvick, who raced his way into Round 2 with a clutch win last week, will start 11th and Dale Earnhardt Jr. begins 12th. \nOnly three of the 12 drivers remaining in the Chase didn't make it to the final round of qualifying - Brad Keselowski (starts 13th), Martin Truex (15th) and Jeff Gordon (22nd).
