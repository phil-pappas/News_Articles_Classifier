But the 68-year-old sounds pleased to coach the running backs at No. 10 Utah on Kyle Whittingham’s staff. By Seattle Times staff The Associated Press \nSALT LAKE CITY – Winning a national championship puts a coach in an exclusive group. Winning multiple titles moves a coach into an entirely different realm. \nTen coaches have won multiple AP national championships since 1970. Nine of those never worked on a staff as anything less than a head coach afterward, according to STATS. \nThe 10th is Dennis Erickson — who is toiling in relative obscurity as the running-backs coach for No. 10 Utah. \nThe 68-year-old Erickson, a former Washington State and Seahawks coach, sounds perfectly content despite some of those on the outside wondering why a man who won two national titles at Miami and guided two NFL teams would coach running backs at a growing program.

I never got into the game or played the game or coached to win a national championship. … My goal when I was in college was to be a high-school coach and that’s where I started. I could have been happy doing that all my life because I like being around the players.” \nErickson’s career seemed to be at an end after being fired from Arizona State in 2011. He was named conference coach of the year after going 10-3 in 2007, but that was his lone season above .500 with the Sun Devils. \nErickson used the year after his dismissal to travel and play golf, but that got old in, “probably about two days.” So, when Utah coach Kyle Whittingham called, Erickson was ready. \nThe two had formed a relationship as fellow Pac-12 coaches, but Erickson didn’t make his desire to return known. \n“I just thought, you know what, I’m going to give Dennis a call and take his temperature and feel it out and see what his mindset would be to get back in,” Whittingham recalled. \nErickson’s original title was co-offensive coordinator along with Brian Johnson, who was in charge of quarterbacks. But Dave Christensen was Utah’s offensive coordinator last year, before leaving for Texas A&M after the season. \nFormer Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, 85, said he is not surprised Erickson is still going. \n“It’s in his blood,” Bowden said. “And as you get older, I think there’s a tendency to kind of fall back and relax and enjoy life. Do something that you love to do. He’s kind of getting up there where you can look back and enjoy what you did and finish up by not having all the pressure you did when you were younger.” \nErickson has helped develop Devontae Booker into one of the elite backs in the nation and has a bank of knowledge and experience no other coach on the staff has. \nErickson looks at the future one season at a time, but another head-coaching position is out of the question. \n“Been there, done that,” he said. “I’ve been at the top of the mountain and been at the bottom of the mountain. Long as I have energy and as long as I can do some good things for the University of Utah, I plan on coaching.” Note \n• Wet fields might be a factor in two of the biggest games Saturday, No. 13 Alabama at No. 8 Georgia and No. 6 Notre Dame at No. 12 Clemson. \nAfter 72 straight games as a favorite, according to The New York Times, Alabama is a two-point underdog.
