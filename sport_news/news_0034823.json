LOUIS — Rookie Robby Fabbri scored the tiebreaking goal midway through the third period to help the St. Louis Blues beat Edmonton 3-1 Thursday night, spoiling Oilers rookie Connor McDavid's NHL debut. \nVladimir Tarasenko had the tying goal for the Blues near the midpoint of the second period, and Troy Brouwer added an empty-netter with 18 seconds remaining in the third. Brian Elliott finished with 23 saves. \nRyan Nugent-Hopkins scored in the first period for Edmonton and Cam Talbot had 28 saves. \nMcDavid, the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft, took 22 shifts, played 18:07 and was on the ice for Brouwer's goal. He had two shots on goal, and struggled on faceoffs — winning only three of 13. \nFabbri, a 19-year-old forward — and McDavid's childhood friend — was also playing in his first NHL game. The Blues' first-round pick in 2014 was one of three rookies in the St. Louis lineup, joining defensemen Colton Parayko and Joel Edmundson. \nNugent-Hopkins gave the Oilers a 1-0 lead late in the first period with a fluke power-play goal. He lost a face-off but when Blues defenseman Alex Pietrangelo tried to clear the puck it bounced off Alexander Steen and past Brian Elliott. Nugent-Hopkins was credited with the unassisted power-play goal with 2:38 remaining in the period. \nTarasenko tied it a 9:10 of the second after getting loose on a breakaway with a stretch pass from Alex Pietrangelo and beating Talbot through his legs. \nTarasenko, who signed an eight-year, $60 million extension in the offseason, was the last Blues player to score in his debut. \nNOTES: McDavid and F Anton Slepyshev made their NHL debuts for the Oilers. ...
