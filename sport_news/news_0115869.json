Brady is 3-0 against America's team. \nWhile the Cowboys are always known for their glitz and glamour, Brady will once again be the marquee name on Sunday (sorry, Brandon Weeden ). \nBrady, who squared off against Romo once in 2007, first played against the Cowboys in 2003. The quarterback was one of the more controversial selections of the Jerry Jones era: Quincy Carter. \nCarter was a 2001 second-round pick and highly regarded a reach -- and later a bust. However, on Nov. 16, 2003, Carter locked horns with Brady. \nHere's a picture from that game. \nQuincy Carter was 20 of 36 for 210 yards and three interceptions against Tom Brady and the Pats in 2003. Al Bello \nCarter threw three interceptions, Brady didn't throw a touchdown and the Patriots won, 12-0 , in a season that later ended with their second Lombardi Trophy. Carter actually led Dallas to the playoffs, but they lost in the wild-card round to the Panthers. \nCarter's abrupt release from the Cowboys in Aug. 2004 due to a failed drug test, some say, indirectly saved Romo's roster spot with the Cowboys that year. But you can learn more about that watching the video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:34:26.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
