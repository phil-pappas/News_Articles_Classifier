Khanna\nTribune News Service\nChandigarh, October 1\nCommission agents or arhtiyas, the vital link between procurement agencies and farmers in the paddy procurement process, are at loggerheads with the Punjab Food and Civil Supplies Department over the payment of provident fund of hundreds of labourers employed for lifting paddy. There is a dispute over who would deposit the 50 per cent share of PF of labourers engaged for paddy procurement in over 1,700 mandis of the state. The matter stands unresolved even as the procurement season has begun today. The commission agents want the government to pay the contribution as the government is the principal employer, but the government says the agents should contribute. The matter may snowball into a major problem affecting procurement, lifting and transportation from mandis to mills or warehouses. Labourers are not willing to accept a cut in the fixed labour charge of Rs 1.83 per bag lifted by them. A meeting to was held here last evening but it remained inconclusive. The genesis of this stand off lies in the change in policy of employing labour in mandis. During the wheat season in April, in an attempt to break the Mandi labour cartels, the government had allowed the commission agents to hire labour on their own at a fixed charge of Rs 1.83 per bag. Later the PF commissioner served a notice to the government for failing to deduct PF of labourers and open their accounts. Following this, the government deducted the amount it had to release to the commission agents for labour charges and deposited the PF contributions. The agents have now refused to make any contributions to PF, said Vijay Kalra of the Punjab Commission Agents Association. RBI okays Rs 18,972 cr This year, 137 lakh tonnes of paddy is expected to be procured by various agencies, including 20.5 lakh tonnes to be procured by the Food Corporation of India. The cash credit limit of Rs 18,972 crore was approved by the RBI today for buying paddy by the state procurement agencies and another Rs 300 crore cash credit limit has been approved by the RBI for the FCI to buy paddy. Agriculture officials say since paddy had high moisture, it would still take another week for the produce to mature and reach mandis. Not paid by miller, arhtiyas lock market Sangrur: To protest the alleged non-payment of Rs 18 crore to about 120 arhtiyas by rice mill owner Rupinder Bansal and his partners, the former locked three of the four gates of the local grain market. One gate was left open so that shopkeepers, selling pesticides, and their families residing in grain market did not face inconvenience. The arhtiyas led by Bhim Sain, president, Arhtiya Association, Sangrur, have been protesting since September 26. They have also held a dharna outside the rice mill on the Ubhawal road. They claimed they were yet to get payment of paddy sold to the rice mill in October last year. — TNS Farmers hold rally to press for relief Sangrur: Hundreds of farmers, including women, on Thursday took out a protest march through the main markets in the city against the “anti-farmer” policies of the state and central governments and in support of their demands. They also raised slogans against the government. They have been observing indefinite dharna since September 28 outside the district administrative complex (DC office) here. Their main demands include Rs 40,000 per acre as compensation to those growers whose cotton crop was recently damaged due to whitefly attack and Rs 20,000 per family as compensation to farm labourers who have lost their employment due to the whitefly attack. — TNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:17:24.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
