In a way it's important, because you get what you give, and if we want others to be nice to us, our behaviour towards them should be similar, isn’t it? But! if our so called nice behaviour is superficial, as a mask over not-so-nice feelings, it will not win us any goodwill in return, because the law of karma operates even at the most subtle level, which says “as you sow, so shall you reap”.\nHence it is very important to have genuinely good feelings towards others, because when our feelings are pure, good wishes and nice behaviour comes naturally. We don't have to tell ourselves to be nice to someone or, at a more subtle level, suppress or dismiss negative thoughts that arise on seeing someone.\n​The author is a spiritual educator and columnist, nikunjji@gmail.com and www.bk.ooo\nHave a spiritual message?
