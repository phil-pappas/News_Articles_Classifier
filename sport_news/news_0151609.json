The shakeup included shifting the domiciles of his two main companies from Hong Kong to the Cayman Islands, triggering speculation that he was planning to withdraw from China.\n\"We are vigilant not to let these unfounded allegations escalate to cause investors' concerns,\" said the statement released Tuesday by his company CK Hutchison Holdings. It said there was \"no truth in the withdrawal accusations.\"\nThe statement said Li was \"confident\" that Chinese President Xi Jinping will continue to improve governance and reform China's economy.\nThe former British colony's tycoons have long embraced China's communist leaders in order to ensure survival of their business interests on the mainland. Li was part of a business contingent that met Xi in Beijing last year to show their support as tensions rose over pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\nThe 87-year-old Li has long been Asia's richest person, although he recently fell to second place with a fortune of $24.3 billion, according to Forbes.\nEarlier this month, a think tank affiliated with the official Xinhua news agency and the People's Daily newspaper, the communist party's mouthpiece, both lambasted Li over his business decisions in China.\nLi said his company has been taking a \"prudent\" approach to mainland China property investment over the past two years because of an \"imbalance\" between supply and demand.\n\"Reducing property investments does not imply we are not investing in the mainland,\" the statement said. It said the company's retail network in China has risen 77 percent to 2,300 stores in the same period.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
