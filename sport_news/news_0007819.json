Related Content \nJacob de Grom will start Game 2 for the Mets, followed by rookie Noah Syndergaard and left-hander Steven Matz, as Collins has decided to go with a four-man rotation. \nThat means Syndergaard would be on the mound if there were a Game 7. \n\"(Harvey) said, 'I'll be ready,'\" Collins said of his Game 1 starter. \"We like going into Kansas City with our Nos. 1 and 2 guys. Noah has pitched great at home. We thought that's a good mix. And obviously we think Steven Matz showed us, even though it hasn't been the depth into the games like he's going to do in the future, for four or five innings he's been pretty good.\" \nHarvey was next in line to pitch when the Mets finished off their four-game sweep of the Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series. He would be ready to pitch in relief if the World Series were to go to Game 7. \nDeGrom is 3-0 with a 1.80 ERA in the postseason, but he struggled a bit in his last two starts, and Collins believes he might be a little tired and could benefit from an extra day of rest.
