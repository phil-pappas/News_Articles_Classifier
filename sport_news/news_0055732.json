I lost control of my car. My teammates, including Marshawn, stopped 2 check on me. They weren't racin me\n— Fred Jackson (@Fred22Jackson) October 21, 2015 Jackson was not injured in the crash. Teammates, including Lynch, reportedly rushed to the scene after the crash.\nFrom The Associated Press:\nThe Renton Police Department said shortly before 5 p.m. PDT on Tuesday, Jackson lost control of his 2016 Chevrolet Corvette as he drove down Seahawks Way. The crash happened about 48 hours before the Seahawks face the San Francisco 49ers in a Thursday night game. Jackson's vehicle sustained moderate front end damage. Jackson remained on scene until officers arrived and was cooperative. He was then taken by team personnel back to the facility and did not report any injuries.\nPhotos of Jackson's car with New York license plates were seen on social media. A stop sign and street signs were knocked over in the wreck. The accident happened at the end of a long straight road with a slight bend at the end that leads from the Seahawks facility to Lake Washington Blvd. The stop sign knocked over was in front of a \"Welcome to Renton\" sign that includes the Seahawks logo.\nHere's the scene of accident outside VMAC pic.twitter.com/S70o2R34tt\n— Bob Condotta (@bcondotta) October 21, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Fred22Jackson/status/656655528152567808", "https://twitter.com/bcondotta/status/656632528099381248", "https://t.co/S70o2R34tt"], "published": "2015-10-21T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:32:07.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
