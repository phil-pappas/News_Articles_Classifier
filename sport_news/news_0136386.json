Some even got their weekends started a little early. Power forward Gorjok Gak and point guard Loren Jackson caught flights on Thursday. We take a look at where those two and others are headed this weekend.\nEarly starts to weekend \nVictory Rock Prep (Bradenton, Fla.) power forward Gorjok Gak and point guard Loren Jackson are headed to Stillwater, Oklahoma for an official visit to Oklahoma State. Gak recently took a ride up I-75 for an unofficial visit to Florida. He also holds offers from Connecticut, Long Beach State, Missouri and Nebraska. With Juwan Durham 's commitment to Connecticut, the Huskies appear to have faded in Gak's recruitment. \nJackson has seen consistent interest from Bradley and picked up interest from Drake in addition to his offer from Oklahoma State. \nFive Star weekend \nThis weekend's highest ranked official visitor is Jacksonville (Fla.) Potter's House five-star big man Udoka Azubuike . The powerful center visits North Carolina starting Friday. The visit to UNC comes on the heels of a recent visit to Florid State. Azubuike has also taken official visits to Kansas and North Carolina State and his brother, Harry Coxsome, Jr. indicated that a visit to Auburn or Kentucky could happen. Florida State is in pretty good shape here and we expect Azubuike to make his college choice before his senior season starts. \nHuell may be nearing a decision \nAfter his recent visit to Florida State, the Seminoles are in good shape to land Miami Norland five-star power forward Dewan Huell . Miami and South Carolina also received visits from Huell. South Florida had one scheduled but after the date needed to be rescheduled, the visit to Tampa was ultimately canceled. Huell looks to be nearing the end of the process and it appears to be a battle between FSU and Miami for Huell's signature. \nMore key visitors \nMiami Dade JuCo sophomore shooting guard Marvin Jean Pierre is expected at Florida Gulf Coast for Dunk City After Dark on Friday night. \nVisitors from the class of 2017 include Brion Whitley and Latravian Glover who will visit Florida Gulf Coast and Michael Akuchie visits Cornell. Victory Uyaelumno and Solomon Uyaelumno will visit Stanford. Miami is expecting 2018 small forward Nassir Little and point guard Ronaldo Segu . \nRuss Wood is a contributing national basketball recruiting analyst for Rivals.com.
