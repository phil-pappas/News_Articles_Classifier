In addition, 21 freshmen have seen action this season, a number that ranks 11th in the country. Head coach Larry Coker’s team are putting up 361 yards of offense per game, while giving up a whopping 416 on the defensive side of the ball. \nVery nearly the definition of a \"trap\" game. But looks can be deceiving. \n“They’ve played an awfully good opening schedule with Oklahoma State, Kansas State, Arizona, Colorado State, which was a bowl team last year, then finally Louisiana Tech, who was picked by most people to win (the Conference USA West Division),” said third-year Golden Eagle head coach Todd Monken. “There are a lot of teams in our league that would be 1-5 in those games. It amazes me because all the people they’ve lost and they still find a way to score points and defend. \n“That shows a lot about their coaching staff and players.” \nSouthern Miss enters the Oct. 17 contest (kickoff at 6 p.m. at M.M. Roberts Stadium) at 3-3 overall and 1-1 in Conference USA action. The game, though, carries extra weight for a variety of reasons. First off, it’s the Golden Eagles’ designated homecoming matchup, something Monken isn’t terribly concerned with, although he concedes there is added value. \n“I’m just really focused on having a good plan,” he said. “But I get it. Our job is to create memories when (the fans) come. Our role is to find a way to win and make the fans proud of their university and their football team.” \nOn top of that, it’s a West Division tilt. The Golden Eagles are 1-0 versus their division-mates, while UTSA is 1-1. \n“This counts twice because it’s in the division and whoever wins will win any tiebreakers,” Monken said. “It’s important to us and I anticipate we will put our best foot forward.” \nThe Roadrunners will start Dalton Sturm at quarterback, a sophomore with just one start under his belt at the collegiate level. That one start was a doozy, though. Last week, against Louisiana Tech, Sturm passed for 227 yards and three touchdowns. The Bulldogs needed a last-second field goal to take the 34-31 victory. \nHowever, that’s really all Southern Miss has to go by in terms of preparing for a Sturm-led UTSA offense. \n“There are about two games of watching him and he can throw,” Monken said. “But he can also beat you with his feet. He really did a nice job in the second half of the Louisiana Tech game after a rough first half. That says a lot about a quarterback.” Read or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1Lymz7M TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:49:02.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
