Chances were few and far between in the first half, and Storm had to defend well to keep out a well-organised MFA attack. \nStorm occasionally looked dangerous with Nick French down the wings and Malchus Hilton kept getting past the MFA defence, but they couldn't find the net. \nMFA looked comfortable and could have gone ahead had it not been for an incredible double save from Storm keeper Fahim. Storm tried hard to break up MFA's hold on the game, and two crunching tackles from Johnny Murphy seemed to wake Storm up. \nWith minutes to go in the first half, Kirk McPherson broke through, but a great save by MFA keeper Jonty Yervas kept the half goalless. \nLee Ebbutt, Storm's manager, shuffled the pack at half-time and it seemed to work as the action resumed. \nStorm looked stronger and started to maintain better ball possession, and the back three looked tighter with Dave McCurragh taking charge. \nMFA was still playing tidy football, but the experience of the Storm players was coming through as they drew in the young MFA attack and counter-attacked quickly down the flanks. \nWhen Oli Myhill got the ball out quickly to Davis Rizzolo, the latter smoothly went past two defenders and poked the ball under the onrushing MFA keeper to put Storm in the lead. \nRizzolo began causing problems for MFA, and when he was tripped on the edge of the box, Storm nearly doubled the lead when Kirk McPherson's free-kick hit the woodwork and went out. \nMFA strikers pushed forward and they constantly looked dangerous and had it not been for some tough tackles from Murphy and Joe Bunn, they could perhaps have found an equaliser soon. \nDisplaying a moment of magical football, Storm extended its lead when McPherson skipped a tackle and unleashed a 35-yard shot that gave the MFA goalie Yarvas no chance. \nBy now the match was being played at a pacy tempo and MFA pushed forward, desperate for a goal or two. \nIn the dying minutes of the game, MFA scored a well-deserved goal after some neat touch play allowed Majid al Hadhrami to open up the Storm defence and slide the ball under the keeper. \nStorm manager Ebbutt said, \"In the first half, we were lucky to be goalless and Fahim was superb in goal. MFA has got a great, young football team. At times in the first half, we chased shadows. \nâ€œBut our lads were able to step up in the second half. I was happy to see the team hit two goals and take the pressure off. It would be good to play MFA again soon.\" Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:06:32.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
