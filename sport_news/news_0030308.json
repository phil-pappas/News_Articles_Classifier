Basketball player Lamar Odom is battling for his life in a Nevada hospital. Addicts should be commended for seeking help, not shamed. 7 CONNECT 14 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLet’s talk about something important. \nOver the last two weeks, two well-known professional athletes have made headlines for their actions with substance abuse. \nThere’s Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia, who checked himself into rehab for alcoholism before the team’s wild-card playoff game against the Astros, and there’s basketball player Lamar Odom, who is currently lying in a Nevada hospital fighting for his life after going on a drug and alcohol bender last weekend. \nThe actions of these men have each been met with divided feelings from fans and outsiders. Some are supportive, and hope they find recovery from their addictions, while others bash them, and say they’re being selfish. \nThe latter group makes me sick. \nTo say something as delusional as calling an addict “selfish” stretches beyond insensitivity. Maybe it’s a lack of understanding, but it nonetheless does not make the comments excusable. \nAs someone who has had family members battle addiction, who has had friends battle addiction, and who has personally battled addiction, I understand more than most what it does to a person and how it affects the people around them. \nI also understand that if the negative stigma that comes with addiction doesn’t change soon, we will continue to lose friends, family, loved ones, even our favorite celebrities. \nWhen the announcement came that Sabathia — a key cog in the Yankees’ rotation — was leaving the team before the biggest game of the year (which he wasn’t scheduled to pitch in), many people questioned the timing. \nThey didn’t think about CC Sabathia, the person, they thought about CC Sabathia, the pitcher. \nI’ve interviewed Sabathia a couple of times. Not one-on-one or discussing anything intimately with the man, but I’ve stood at his locker, phone in hand, and listened to what he had to say. \nIt’s one thing to see someone you’re used to seeing on TV in person, but it’s another thing to be so close to them that you can see every detail of their fully-tattooed arms. \nFor some, seeing them in person reminds you that they’re regular human beings. \nYes, in Sabathia’s case he may be 6-foot-7, a gifted pitcher and have more money than I’ll likely ever see in a lifetime, but at his core he is just another person with a life, a job, and a family. \nI didn’t need to have previously interviewed Sabathia to write this, because I understand more than most that people are more than what they appear to be. Sabathia is more than just a pitcher. I am more than just a sportswriter. We are all human, and we all have traits that we are not proud of. \nMy first reaction to the Sabathia news was shock, only because it seemingly came out of nowhere. I never thought about the timing of the announcement because I understand more than most that being healthy comes before everything. \nYes, Sabathia has fans, teammates, and bosses he does not want to let down, but he also has a family at home and life that he doesn’t want cut short. The two groups are incomparable. \nSabathia was brave enough to seek help in spite of the timing and should be commended for that, not shamed. Anyone who can’t see that needs to re-evaluate their priorities. \nOdom is a different beast in that he comes from a turbulent past, which many do not know about, and his drug use has been in the media since his marriage and subsequent divorce to Khloe Kardashian. \nAgain, rather than take the time to get to know the man, people jump to judge the athlete. \nThey don’t see Lamar Odom, the man with a drug-addicted father, the man whose mother died when he was 12, the man whose son died at six months old; no, they see Lamar Odom, the basketball player who has millions and fame and is seemingly throwing it all away. \nPeople forget that addiction is a disease; one that must be treated or could be fatal. Maybe they don’t forget — maybe they just don’t know or understand. But if they don’t know or understand, they should either get informed or keep quiet. \nIt’s easy to admire athletes when they’re all-stars and winning world championships, and it’s even easier to lose sight of the fact that they are in fact humans just like you and me. None of us were created perfect, and it would be ignorant to think that athletes are the exception just because they were blessed with the ability to do things, physically, others cannot. \nWhen Sabathia is out of rehab and if Odom recovers, the Twitter trolls will come out in full force, hoping that insensitive remarks are worth the trade-off for a few favorites and retweets. \nYou’ll hear them spout outlandish theories like how Sabathia leaving was a distraction to the Yankees and why that’s the reason they lost the wild-card game, or how Odom’s downward spiral is all because he fell in love with a Kardashian. \nYou won’t hear them talk about Sabathia and Odom’s charitable work, or how they are coincidentally two of the most well-liked and well-respected players in their respective leagues. \nIt's easier if they just left those parts out. 7 CONNECT 14 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1LE8QvY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:24:06.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
