Both teams’ starting lineups will be introduced before the anthems and former Jays’ manager Cito Gaston will throw out the ceremonial first pitch.\nPRICE’S RANGER DANGER\nThe Jays’ ace lefty has lost three straight playoff games to the Rangers: twice in the 2010 ALDS and again in the 2011 ALDS. Texas has also hit him harder than any other team over his career, leaving him with a 5.15 career ERA against the Rangers in 11 starts.\nGALLARDO\nThe Rangers’ righty is carrying a 13 2/3 scoreless-innings streak against the Jays into Thursday’s game, having twice shut them out this season. But the veteran finesse pitcher had a less-than-stellar final month of the season, posting a 4.85 ERA over his final six starts while allowing opposing hitters to put up a bloated .347/.396/.556 slash line.\nPlayers to watch:\nEdwin Encarnacion\nThe Jays’ slugger has homered off Gallardo three times in 16 career at-bats.\nElvis Andrus\nThe usually light-hitting Rangers’ shortstop has owned Price in his career, hitting .429, while reaching base more than half the time in 43 career plate appearances.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays rotation for playoffs: How it lines up\nOttawa mayor raises Blue Jays flag ahead of playoffs", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:40:59.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
