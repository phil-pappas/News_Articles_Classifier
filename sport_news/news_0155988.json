The ministers, party legislators and senior party functionaries met Sonia at 10 Janpath today morning. They submitted a memorandum to the AICC chief which was also given to President Pranab Mukherjee, yesterday. Irrigation and Public Health Minister Vidya Stokes and Sukhu informed Sonia about the latest political developments in the aftermath of the CBI raid at Virbhadra’s residence on the day of the marriage of his daughter. Significantly, four independent MLAs in the Assembly also met Sonia along with the Congress leaders. The ministers, Congress legislators and independent MLAs also met senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel late last evening. Party MLAs said Patel, while addressing the Himachal Congress men, urged them to remain united as a concerted effort was being made by the BJP at the behest of the RSS to defame and tarnish the image of senior Congress leadership. He is also learnt to have praised the Himachal Congress for putting up a united fight in the aftermath of the CBI raid at the residence of Virbhadra on September 26. “He appreciated that instead of coming in different groups as was the case in the past, the entire party has given a united show,” said a minister. Patel is also learnt to have urged the Congress to fight the BJP as one without any dissensions. The four independent MLAs are learnt to have told Patel that their support was for Virbhadra specifically and not the Congress government as such. With the Congress high command coming out openly in support of Virbhadra, all the Congress ministers, MLAs and senior leaders have stood by him and condemned the raids at his residence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:26:54.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
