The Patriots have prevailed the past six times the teams met, the past four games (during the Andrew Luck era) by an average of 29 points, pushing their all-time series lead to 50-29. But as for how all that relates to Sunday night’s game in Indianapolis, well, Malcolm Butler really doesn’t get the point. “The past is the past,” the Patriots cornerback said. And, when it serves the purpose, the past is to be forgotten. It is the Patriots’ way. “We get a friendly reminder each week every year that what you did before doesn’t matter, so I don’t think we even think about the last couple games or any of that,” safety Devin McCourty said on Thursday. “You just go out and play for this team. “Obviously, their team’s a lot different, our team’s a lot different. We’ve just got to go and prepare and be ready for this year.” According to special teams captain Matthew Slater, it’s all about “clearing the memory card.” “Every game’s a new game,” said Slater. “There are new players. There are new plays being run. So it’s totally different and I think once you play games in the past you kind of have to clear the memory card on that and just move on to the next game.” Running back LeGarrette Blount seconds the motion. “You’ve just got to concentrate on playing them. You’ve got to concentrate on beating them this year,” the running back said. “All the games in the past (are) not going to help us right now. “They can easily come (out) and win a game, so we’ve just got to come in here and make sure we’re on all our p’s and q’s and make sure that we’ve got everything figured out and settled down, and make sure that we can come out there and expose everything to get us a ‘W’ (win).” If the Colts do come out and win Sunday night’s game at Lucas Oil Stadium, it would mark their first win in the series since their 35-34 victory in the famous fourth-and-two game of 2009. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick’s respect for then-Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was such that rather than punt the ball away and allow his defense to protect a six-point lead, he opted to go for it from his own 28 with 2:08 to play, a move that ultimately cost his team the game. Page 2 of 2 - Since then the Patriots have won six straight against the Colts, two of them in the playoffs. Only one of those six games, a 42-20 romp last Nov. 16 that saw the since-departed Jonas Gray spring onto the scene with 37 carries for 201 yards and a Patriots franchise-record four rushing touchdowns, was played in Indy, however. In four matchups with Luck, the Patriots have made the Colts’ franchise quarterback look like – dare we say? – Brandon Weeden, limiting him to a passer rating of 58.7, a passing percentage of 50.3 and intercepting him (10 times) nearly twice as often as they’ve allowed him to throw for a TD (six). Blount shakes all of that off, however, much like he shook off Colts defenders in rushing for 148 yards and three TDs in the Patriots’ 45-7 romp in the teams’ AFC Championship game (a.k.a. the Deflategate game) in Foxboro on Jan. 18 of this year. Blount had an even bigger game (24 carries for 166 yards and a franchise-record four rushing touchdowns in the Patriots’ 43-22 rout in the teams’ divisional playoff game on Jan. 11, 2014. “I’m sure they’ve forgotten about all those times like we have,” said Blount. “They’re coming in here with a different mind-set of zero-zero and they’re trying to get a win just like we are. “You don’t know what to expect. You can’t expect the same thing every time, so you’ve just got to concentrate on who they have on the field, who they have now (as) opposed to who they had back then, and just try to stay forward and focus on trying to get a job done this week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:00:26.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
