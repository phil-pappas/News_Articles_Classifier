The red-hot Patriots visit the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium for the first time, but the ’Boys won’t have quarterback Tony Romo or wide receiver Dez Bryant at their disposal. It could turn into another blowout if the Patriots made good use of their bye week, per usual.\nHere are five things to watch today.\nQB ‘duel’ a major mismatch\nIn the red corner, the Patriots are starting four-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady. In the blue corner, the Cowboys are starting Brandon Weeden, who has lost 10 consecutive starts and hasn’t logged a victory since his Browns beat the Chiefs on Dec. 9, 2012. Brady, by the way, is 35-11, including 5-2 in the playoffs, since Weeden’s last victory. Brady should dice up a Cowboys defense that ranks 19th against the pass, and he’ll likely wear out Rob Gronkowski, even with Cowboys linebacker Sean Lee getting his final clearance in the league’s concussion protocol Friday. Yeah, this one is a mismatch.\nLining ’em up . . . and knocking ’em down?\nThe Cowboys offensive line is a fortress, and Weeden needs it to withstand a series of attacks. The Patriots’ 13 sacks are the fifth-most in the NFL despite having played one fewer game than every other team in the top eight. The vaunted Dallas line is sometimes only as good as the players behind it. The Cowboys are ranked 16th in rushing, and their eight sacks allowed are tied with three other teams for the 15th most, so statistically, they’re average. Weeden has taken five of those sacks in 64 dropbacks. Surely, Dallas has an incredible line, but it was helped a lot more in 2014 by Romo and DeMarco Murray.\nJust who carries the day for Patriots\nNow that both Dion Lewis and LeGarrette Blount are up to full speed, this should be another chance to see how the Patriots prefer to divvy up the snaps at running back. Conventional wisdom suggests the Patriots will open with Lewis and close with Blount, as they did vs. the Jaguars, but today is different with Blount back to himself again. As has been the case so far, it’ll depend just how frequently Brady and Josh McDaniels plan to chuck it. One more question: Will James White get earlier snaps after contributing late last week, or is he strictly in uniform to spell Lewis in lopsided games?\nThe health check could prove sore point\nThe Patriots had perfect attendance for all four of their practices last week. But they did have some nagging situations to monitor with offensive lineman Ryan Wendell (illness) and cornerback Tarell Brown (foot). Wendell is listed as probable to make his season debut, but don’t expect the O-line rotation to stop. The question is who among David Andrews, Josh Kline, Shaq Mason or Tre’ Jackson would be inactive in his place? They could dress eight linemen, but that seems unlikely. It’s important for Brown, meanwhile, to be healthy later this season, so they might take it easier on him.\nNo instant indoctrination for newcomers\nThe Patriots traded for linebacker Jon Bostic and defensive tackle Akiem Hicks during the bye week, but it’s unrealistic to think either would make a defensive impact today. Bostic has no chance of leapfroging Jamie Collins or Dont’a Hightower, and the same should be said for Jerod Mayo as long as he isn’t more banged up than believed. Hicks, meanwhile, is one of six defensive tackles on the 53-man roster after the Pats also promoted Khyri Thornton. They haven’t dressed more than four for a game yet this season. These trades were made for depth purposes, so don’t expect immediate dividends.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:36:14.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
