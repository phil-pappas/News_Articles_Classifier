And if you're in front make sure you leave enough space to see headlights. When it comes to passing, it's best to pass on the left side.\n\"Now we know there are times that you must pass on the right side in stop-and-go traffic, but as soon as traffic in front of you clears…try to not linger by a truck over there. We have less visibility on that side and it's just a little harder to judge because we're using convex mirrors,” says Klang.\nAfter the presentation she let the kids hop into the driver’s seat to see what it's like navigating the road from her perspective and to check out her living quarters. Klang has been driving for thirty-six years and hopes the students will see truck driving as a viable career choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:28:17.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
