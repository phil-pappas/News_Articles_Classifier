Zach Mettenberger will start at quarterback. Coach Ken Whisenhunt said Friday that Mariota has been ruled out after missing practice all week and the rookie's knee has not quite healed up. Mettenberger practiced as the starter in Mariota's absence. \"It's a combination of missing practice and not quite being there (physically),\" Whisenhunt said. \"He's close, but it's a combination of those two things. We decided that was the best way to go this week.\" Mariota sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee when hit low by Miami defensive end Olivier Vernon in last week's 38-10 loss to the Dolphins. Mariota stayed in the game wearing a brace, while the NFL has fined Vernon $17,363 for the hit in the knee area and another $20,000 for hitting the quarterback later in the head and neck area. Mettenberger started six of the seven games he played last season as a rookie. The sixth-round draft pick out of LSU still is looking for his first career win, and he threw for 1,412 yards with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions last season. Mettenberger said that helping the Titans (1-4) end their four-game losing streak is of more importance to him than being back under center as the starter this week. \"The important thing is we go out there and try to get a team win. That's ultimately my job. It doesn't matter who's out there at quarterback, everyone is expecting us to win a ballgame, and that's what I've been working toward,\" Mettenberger said.
