The student had reportedly arrived to school late and had tried to avoid the metal detectors at the building’s entrance. As a result, he was subjected to an administrative search. Upon opening the student’s backpack, officers saw a gun, police said. The student then fled from the office.\n After a struggle, officers were able to apprehend the student and recover the loaded .32 caliber handgun from the backpack, according to police.\n“There is never a good reason to bring a gun to school. Illegal guns have no place on our streets and certainly not in the hands of a child,” Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said in a release. “Thanks to the keen observations and quick actions of the school police officers and administrators, a potential tragedy was avoided and one less gun is on the streets.”", "external_links": ["http://bpdnews.com/news/2015/10/22/daily-dose-of-great-police-work-bps-safety-service-officers-recover-illegal-firearm-at-tech-boston-academy-1"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:11:24.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
