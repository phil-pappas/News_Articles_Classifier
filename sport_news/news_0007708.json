Derek Jeter, Michael Jordan, it was different for all of them. Will I wake up one morning and say 'That's it'? Is it a gradual thing?\" \nBryant admits that the seemingly endless questions about his retirement date \"can be a pain in the ass.\" \n\"But when I sit back and think about it, it's cool, because it means that I had a very good career, people respect my career,\" he said. \nLakers president Jim Buss meanwhile has hinted the club could be ready to hold discussions about an extension, arguing Bryant's status as a franchise legend has earned him the right to exit on his own terms. \n\"I'm not going to sit there and say, 'This is it, Kobe, you're done,' because it's not my decision -- it's his decision,\" Buss said in August. \n- Tough season looming - \nYet the prospect of the upcoming season providing Bryant with the opportunity of riding into the sunset after another glorious chapter to his Lakers career are slim to non-existent. \nLast season the Lakers had the second worst record of any side in the formidably strong Western Conference, winning only 21 games and losing 61. \nIt was the second season in a row the Lakers had failed to reach the playoffs, and a third failure to reach the postseason seems the likeliest outcome for the 2015-2016 campaign. \nThere are also serious question marks about Bryant's ability to stay the course. \nIn each of the three previous years he has suffered serious injuries that forced him to end his season prematurely. In 2013 he sustained a ruptured Achilles, which was followed by a fractured knee in 2014 before a torn rotator cuff in his shoulder cut short his 2014-2015 season . \nBryant increasingly sees his role as a mentor to the next generation of Lakers, which includes the likes of Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson and D'Angelo Russell, the talented 19-year-old rookie who was just seven months old when Bryant arrived for his first Lakers training camp way back in 1996. \n\"There are big question marks on that team, but I am excited, there are young guys, veterans who have played together in the past, it's an interesting mix, we have done the work, now it's the time to put the pieces of the puzzle together,\" Bryant said. \n\"It's interesting to be around these young guys, it's the beginning of their career, of their journey. I am as excited as I have been for a long time. They are bringing energy, it's fun to be part of that -- it makes you feel younger.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:13:09.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
