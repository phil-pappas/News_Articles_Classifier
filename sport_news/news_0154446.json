On Wednesday, NC State head coach Dave Doeren felt he had no choice but to dismiss Shadrach Thornton from the Wolfpack football program . \nIt wasn’t because of the lone incident of Thornton running over a pedestrian with a moped. The bucket of tolerance had overflowed with bad decisions and multiple chances for Thornton. It’s similar to the situation at Duke with basketball player Rasheed Sulaimon. \nIt’s never easy for a coach to come to the conclusion that it’s time to release a player. But sometimes a player makes that decision for them. \nAfter Thornton served his two-game suspension at the beginning of the year, Doeren said Thornton was \"the best him that he's been since I've been here.\" The coach then opened a window to his thought process of giving a player second, third and sometimes fourth chances. \"…if I felt like I couldn't help him anymore, he wouldn't be here.\" \nThis week, it reached that point. \nIt’s no surprise that Twitter lit up with comparisons of Thornton’s case to that of UNC defensive back Malik Simmons. He was suspended for the first two games of the year after being arrested and charged with resisting arrest. In May, he was arrested for misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Charges were deferred, and Simmons has to perform 24 hours of community service and write an apology to the arresting officer. \nWith is punishment served, Simmons has played sparingly in two games so far this season. \nThe beef on Twitter was how the two players were covered by the media. “Local media looks foolish with double standard. Not a peep from any of them on Simmons,” wrote one fan who obviously prefers red over light blue. \nWRAL did not ignore the arrest or punishment of Malik Simmons . We covered his suspension, the legal process and head coach Larry Fedora's decision to let him return to the team. \nSometimes the team you root for can color your perception of how the media covers a story – whether about your team or a rival. \nThe media didn’t determine the punishment for Simmons or Thornton. The media didn’t decide to dismiss Shadrach Thornton from the NC State football program. \nThe coaches made those choices. \nIs there a double-standard of punishment? Are star players given a longer rope than subs? To a degree, yes. But it also depends on the frequency of the incidents, the severity of the actions and the coach making the decision. \nAfter the dust settled this week, the one who lost the most is Shadrach Thornton. His college career is over, but his parting statement is one to remember. “Throughout my time here at NC State I haven’t always made the best decisions, but from those decisions I have learned unteachable lessons. The lessons we learn while getting knocked down are the ones that stick with us when we get back up.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:34:40.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
