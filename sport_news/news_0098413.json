Photo by Doug Pensinger/Getty Images The Colorado Avalanche opened their season with two rookies on their roster. Now, six games into the 2015-2016 campaign, they have none. On Thursday, the Avs reassigned forward Mikko Rantanen to the AHL’s San Antonio Rampage . They recalled Dennis Everberg to take his place in the lineup.\nSelected by the Avalanche in the first round (10th overall) of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, Rantanen went scoreless with a minus-5 rating in six games with Colorado. During that time, the 19-year-old only averaged 9:12 of ice time per night. It is his first season in North America (which has smaller rinks than Europe), as he spent the last few seasons playing for TPS Turku of the Finnish Liiga.\n\"It's one thing if you're up here and getting your 15-16 minutes a game,\" said executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic . \"We felt it was a good time for him to go down and play a lot. He needs to play a lot, quality minutes on the power play and penalty killing.\"\nOne of the Avalanche’s final cuts during the preseason, Everberg began this season in San Antonio. In three games with the Rampage, the 23-year-old scored three goals and five points. He spent 55 games with the Avalanche last season (his first in North America) before he saw his campaign ended by a shoulder injury, scoring three goals and 12 points.\nAs he is on a two-way deal, Rantanen has an annual salary of $70,000 at the AHL level. The Avalanche also have the option of sliding his entry-level deal to next season, as long as he plays less than 10 games at the NHL level in 2015-2016.", "external_links": ["http://www.sarampage.com/features/?article_id=3171", "http://www.denverpost.com/avalanche/ci_29009536/avalanche-sends-rookie-mikko-rantanen-minors-recall-dennis"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:00:52.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
