He tries a drop shot that Pospisil easily gets to and then the Spaniard rips a forehand for a crosscourt winner.But the set would go to a tiebreak with Nadal now leading 3-1, but the Canadian sends this well long.Rafa now has set point, and Pospisil comes in to the net and tries to put away a volley but instead has a forehand blasted at him which he can't control and Nadal takes the breaker 7-3 to claim the frame.The second set would also be close, but a break of serve would lead to match point for Nadal, and he takes it in style with a big forehand to the corner to complete a straight sets win in a more promising performance from the King of Clay that sees him advance to the third round against Jack Sock. Nadal downs Pospisil 7-6, 6-4 \nFourth-seeded Spaniard beats Rosol 7-6, 6-2 Lukas Rosol serving to David Ferrer who loses this point and then his cool as the Spaniard lashes out and kicks a chair. He would have a word or two with his racquet and calm down.It seems to work as Ferrer takes the first set with a volley to win the tiebreaker 7-5.The Spaniard continues to play with aggression and takes a bit of a tumble here, but is quickly back on his feet to chase a lob that goes out of play.On match point, Ferrer catches the corner of the service box, but Rosol challenges hoping for another cahcne. Hawkeye shows that the serve was indeed in so Ferrer takes the frame 6-2 for a straight sets win and is off to the third round. Second seed falls to Uruguyuan 6-4, 6-4 Second seed Tomas Berdych's quest to make the ATP World Finals suffered a setback as he lost 6-4, 6-4 to Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay. Berdych became the third seeded player to fall in the first round in Beijing. The Czech served four double faults, and hit 32 unforced errors, as he crashed out of the competition. Wild card defeats Troicki 6-4, 7-5 to advance Chinese Taipei's Lu Yen-Hsun in the near court, is making the most of his wild card entry as he takes on Viktor Troicki. The Serbian catches the net to give Lu the first set 6-4.Trailing 5-4 in the second set, Lu would fight back with a nice backhand down the line and later break Troiki for a 6-5 lead.On match point, Troiki can;t handle the serve so Lu's run continues wiht another upset and he will next face Ferrer.
