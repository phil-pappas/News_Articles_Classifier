It was his third such win in the last two years, with the previous two victories resulting in the 2014 championship.\nUSA TODAY\nKevin Harvick wins at Dover; Jimmie Johnson eliminated from Chase\nAnd now, as with Bond, Harvick’s survival probably means big trouble for those who were counting on him being gone.\nIs the competition worried?\n“The way he ran today, hell yeah,” Kyle Busch said. “That was a guy that we wanted to knock out, you know? That’s a guy that can win all these races, and you don’t want to have to compete against a guy like that.”\n“It’s not good we weren’t able to eliminate him,” Brad Keselowski said, “but there’s a lot of racing left.”\nIf any drivers think Harvick’s continued Chase presence isn’t the worst possible on-track development for them, they’re kidding themselves. They collectively had a chance to knock out a driver who has been enjoying one of the great seasons in NASCAR’s modern era — statistically better than his championship run last year — and they failed.\nUSA TODAY\nDover dooms Jimmie Johnson's Chase, bid for seventh title\nTwo days before the race, Jeff Gordon spoke openly about how 42 other drivers would be trying to prevent Harvick and the No. 4 from winning Sunday.\n“I think you have to understand that everyone in this Chase knows that they are the biggest threat for the championship and if they get eliminated then that takes the biggest threat out of it,” he said.\nWell, guess what? Thanks to Mr. Clutch, that threat isn’t going anywhere.\nHarvick immediately returns to being the driver to beat, just as he was before the Chase began and he suffered two crushing disappointments to open the first round. The most dangerous team in the Chase is not only alive but tied for the lead with 11 others thanks to a points reset.\nYikes.\nIf there’s any solace for the rest of the field — and this might be a stretch — it’s that Harvick crew chief Rodney Childers was already forced to use some of his bullets in staving off elimination. Since advancing through the first round figured to depend on consistency instead of top speed, Childers planned on saving his best cars for later in the Chase.\nInstead, he said, “(We had to) pull out cars that we really didn’t want to.” That includes at New Hampshire Motor Speedway (where Harvick led 216 of 300 laps before running out of gas) and Dover (where he led 355 of 400 en route to Sunday’s win).\nNow Childers isn’t even sure which car he’ll give Harvick to run next week at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\n“I think we’re at a little bit of a disadvantage,” Childers said. “We’ve got a good race team, and we’ve got good cars sitting there, but definitely have had to show more the past two weeks than what we really wanted to.”\nUSA TODAY\nDale Earnhardt Jr. barely advances in Chase for the Sprint Cup\nHarvick reacted to his Dover win with all of the cool of a secret agent. He would not take the bait on questions about the competition or his chances, and there was no hint of the trash talk that flew out of his mouth before the playoff. Instead, he exhibited a laser-focused demeanor and explained how he had quieted the noise of any distractions that could detract from his racing.\n“I don’t follow any of you (reporters) on Twitter; I don’t follow NASCAR on Twitter; I don’t read stories; I don’t go online,” he said. “I think it’s better for us to stay focused on the people who are 100% in tune with our situations and keep things as positive as possible to stay as narrow-minded as possible.\n“Everybody has bought into that. Nobody listens to the chirping. We’re just going to line them back up and see how it goes next week.”\nSee how it goes? Here’s a spoiler alert: Harvick is going to race, win and contend all the way to Homestead-Miami Speedway. And along the way, the competition is going to look back at Dover as one giant missed opportunity.\nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck", "external_links": ["http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/10/04/kevin-harvick-wins-aaa-400-dover-international-speedway-chase-sprint-cup-elimination/73343006/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6507241351785ee2a865c59cbdee4710a918b51/c=0-391-3817-2548&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795844609808662-USP-NASCAR-AAA-400.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/10/04/dale-earnhardt-jr-chase-for-sprint-cup-dover-speedway-nascar/73353622/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/10/04/chase-sprint-cup-eliminations-dover-jimmie-johnson-jamie-mcmurray-clint-bowyer-paul-menard/73356848/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2c739b4cd6d4d76784b41e97ff58ff04481617bd/c=904-0-3954-3050/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795892497176755-johnson-garage.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc138a82d8980caea0fca818c33ee70a9d25cae2/c=501-0-3054-2553/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795760412831579-harvick-car.jpg", "http://twitter.com/jeff_gluck", "http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&isUI=1", "http://imgur.com/TO9VQop.png", "http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:15:23.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
