At Moschino, the classic Chanel lunch suit was thrown off-kilter as Jeremy Scott presented it with a traffic signal twist. Dior's scalloped crop tops and shorts exuded summer prettiness and back home, Amit Aggarwal for his pret line AM.IT (showcased at the recently concluded Amazon India Fashion Week) sent out pieces artfully spliced together by upcycling gamchas and poly bags. Abraham & Thakore married Benarasi brocade with jute sackcloth at the AIFW finale. At NYFW, Alexander Wang's 10th anniversary show had a street grunge vibe while Givenchy showcased goddess like gowns and slips encrusted with pearls and Frou Frou girl Archana Rao sent out delicious pastel skirts embellished with pearls. One sees two different trains of thoughts emerging. It's not just about the 70s or the sporty chic or 60s glam rock but emergence of a new brand of femininity inflected with insouciance.\nDelectable dichotomy\nAsmita Aggarwal, Editor, L'Officiel India says, \"The dichotomy between two ideologies is what makes fashion so delectable. If you look at the Indian catwalks, there are myriad themes which makes it interesting. From ikats to laser cuts, from 3D flowers to pix-elated roses all rub shoulders with each other on the same platform making it a delightful mix.\"\nFashion columnist and FDCI member Nonita Kalra says, \"Bipolar has never looked so good. Or been so much in fashion. The digital revolution has changed the way people consume. There is a space for every kind of taste and designers have cottoned on to this trend. For the creative set this is also good news. They are free to express themselves and aren't dictated by market trends because there is no longer one defining idea. There is a plurality that is making the fashion arena more diverse and definitely more interesting.\"\nFashion loves paradoxes\nFashion columnist Sujata Assomull says, \"Fashion has always loved the idea of paradoxes. Fashion is one place opposites always attract. Fashion is also about reflecting the social cultural trends and influences, and right now we live in a time of constant change. As fashion has to embrace the new markets, where there is opportunity for much-needed growth yet not forget the traditional 'West' who still are the key influencers. It has to become digital savvy, it is about instafashion today - from selfies on the ramp, to live streaming. The allure of slow fashion is just becoming stronger and stronger and there is a new appreciation for craftsmanship and tradition. Fashion is a business and as a business it is driven by the market, and with the market being full of flux, we can see fashion trying to address these issues.\"", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/104225430271191968200/posts"], "published": "2015-10-15T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:04:59.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
