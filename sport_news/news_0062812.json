Nearly 90 per cent of teams that drop the first two games of a best-of-five division series go on to lose the series, while that number climbs to 93 per cent when the team loses their first two games at home. So it’s not looking good. But it’s not over, either. Here are five reasons to believe the Jays can pull off an unlikely comeback.\nRarely swept\nThe Jays haven’t lost three games in a row for more than three months. The last time it happened was July 2-4, weeks before their trade-deadline transformation. So it would be a shock if they lost their first three playoff games. Winning Game 3 wouldn’t guarantee a comeback, of course, but it would be a necessary first step to bring the summit into view. It would also shift the momentum of the series in the Jays’ favour.\nPerez vs. right-handed batters\nMartin Perez, the Rangers’ scheduled starter on Sunday, has been hit much harder this season by right-handed hitters, which bodes well for the Jays, who are stocked with right-handed power bats. Righties have posted a .777 on-base-plus-slugging percentage against Perez this season, while lefties have been limited to a .537 mark. Josh Donaldson, Perez’s former divisional foe with the Oakland A’s, is 5-for-13 against the left-hander in his career with three doubles and a homer.\nDerek Holland\nIf the Jays can beat Perez in Game 3, they’ll get Derek Holland, another lefty, in Game 4. Holland — who drew the ire of some Jays’ fans when he mock-wiped his behind with a rally towel that fell into the Rangers’ bullpen in Game 2 — struggled badly in the final month of the season. He put up a 7.62 ERA in his final five starts, while surrendering six homers and walking 14 batters. He also has been crushed by right-handed hitters this season. Donaldson, Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion have a combined five homers and nine extra-base hits off Holland in 55 career at-bats.\nEstrada and Dickey\nThe Jays’ scheduled starters for Game 3 and 4, on the other hand, were among the league’s best pitchers in the second half. Estrada, who will take the ball Sunday with the Jays’ season on the line, had the second-best, second-half ERA among American League starters, trailing only David Price. Dickey, meanwhile, was tied for third with Justin Verlander. While neither Estrada nor Dickey strike many batters out, they both are among the league leaders in inducing soft contact.\nGlobe Life Park\nIt’s not as hitter-friendly as the Rogers Centre, but the Rangers’ home ballpark in Arlington still favours the batter, which obviously works for either team, but could potentially give a slight edge to the Jays’ deep lineup of sluggers. While the introduction of new seats last season eliminated the park’s infamous “jet stream” that used to lift would-be flyouts into the stands, it’s still home to expansive gaps. Globe Life Park does, however, favour left-handed hitters slightly more than righties since the right-field fence is a few feet shorter.\nALDS Schedule More on thestar.com\nBlue Jays’ Brett Cecil out for season, but will cheer teammates on\nJays hope changeup brings change of fortune: DiManno", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:12:56.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
