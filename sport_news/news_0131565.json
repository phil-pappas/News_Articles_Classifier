Johnson threw an interception on Southside's first play from scrimmage, but the Southside defense responded. \nThe Rebels (4-3, 2-2 7A-West) blocked a Heritage field goal attempt to finish its initial drive, then responded by going 65 yards in nine plays, leaning heavily on the runing game. \nJunior Kobe Rogers finished the drive with a 10-yard touchdown run, but the PAT was wide, leaving the score 6-0 with 6 minutes, 39 seconds left in the opening quarter. \n\"It was pretty ugly, especially in the second half, but you'll take a win in this league any time you can get it,\" Williams said. \"Our defense played really well. Just real sloppy in the second half. But blocking the field goal and getting some momentum going early was big.\" \n\"We had some mishaps and first cold night we've had. The ball seems a little harder sometimes. The offense just didn't get in a great rhythm, especially in the second half. But I thought in the first half we played pretty good.\" \nAfter Southside forced a Heritage punt, the Rebels again put together a 76-yard scoring drive with just one pass completion. Johnson finished it with a 2-yard sneak as the opening quarter ended. The PAT was good this time and Southside pushed its lead to 13-0. \nThe Rebels added another score just before halftime. The 67-yard drive was keyed by a 42-yard gain on a swing pass from Johnson to junior Parker Dixon. Johnson finished off the drive with a 1-yard plunge on third-and-goal. \nHeritage coach Perry Escalante against praised the work of his defense, but acknowledged losing three starters to injuries was problematic. Linebacker Jovanni Gonzalez, receiver/running back Dylan Qualls and defensive lineman Andy Mendoza all left the game and did not return. \n\"They played hard, hard hard,\" Escalante said. \"We got two picks and a fumble recovery. They are just so beat up. We're just physically beat up. It doesn't get any easier. We're going in with a beat up and battered team. We've just got to go back to work.\" \nHeritage's best drive of the night came following the interception by senior David Zamora near midfield in the first quarter. The War Eagles (0-7, 0-4) drove to the Southside 15, but Aaron Pavlak's 36-yard field goal attempt was blocked. \nHeritage did not get inside the Southside 30 the rest of the night. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:00:45.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
