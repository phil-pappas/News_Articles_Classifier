The big senior made his season debut at Oklahoma State — his first action since breaking his leg during last season’s Alamo Bowl. \nPerhaps it wasn’t a coincidence K-State (3-2, 0-2 Big 12) rushed for a season-high 224 yards on Saturday as well. \n“We’re playing together right now,” said K-State backup lineman Terrale Johnson, who filled in for Stiverson in his absence. “Boston comes in and points things out on the field, and we’re playing fresh right now with him back. We’re playing good right now and the running game puts a smile on my face — that’s what we crave.” \nJunior quarterback Joe Hubener led the way on the ground against TCU, rushing for a career-high 111 yards and four touchdowns. Junior running back Charles Jones had 75 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries, while Justin Silmon — who leads the team in rushing this season — had 22 yards on six carries. \n“Our run game has really stepped up,” freshman center Dalton Risner said. “Justin Silmon, Charles Jones and Joe have been running the heck out of the ball. It’s easy when you have guys like that. I’m happy where the o-line is at, but we have a lot of good defenses coming up.” \nRisner said the line took the offense’s struggles personally, particularly the early red-zone deficiencies and lackluster run game. The Wildcats scored on all six trips into the red zone against TCU — including five touchdowns. K-State was 5 for 5 on red-zone touchdowns at Oklahoma State a week earlier. \n“I think that we’re getting after it in practice,” Risner said. “We took it upon ourselves to get better. We knew that we were struggling at the beginning of the season and noticed that we weren’t finishing drives and that we weren’t getting enough rush yards each play. \n“We took it upon ourselves to step up and get better. Everyone knows that when you’re in the red zone, that’s on the offensive line to get the ball in.” \nK-State hosts No. 19 Oklahoma (4-1, 1-1) this Saturday at 2:30 p.m. on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:51:50.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
