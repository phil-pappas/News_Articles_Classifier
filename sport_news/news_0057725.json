And you’re off, weaving through fellow strap-hangers to squeeze through the train doors a split second before they close. Phew, you made it.

But more luxe brands are adding a longer strap to their cases, allowing them to be slung over your shoulder or across your body. In their small way, they’re a game-changer.
