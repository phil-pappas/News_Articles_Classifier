FOXSports 1 day ago Â© Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports Stanford Cardinal running back Christian McCaffrey (5) carries the ball in the second quarter against the UCLA Bruins on Oct. 15 at Stanford Stadium. Christian McCaffrey could be on pace to amass 3,000 total yards this season. Kyle Terada USA Today Sophomore running back Christian McCaffrey had the game of his life against UCLA last Thursday as he rushed for 243 yards and four touchdowns, while gaining 369 all-purpose yards. McCaffrey leads the nation with 1,518 all-purpose yards and is averaging 253 yards per game.\nAdChoices Barry Sanders, the 1988 Heisman Trophy winner, gained 2,743 yards all-purpose yards during that Heisman campaign, an all-time record. Sanders did most of his damage on the ground, rushing for a record of 2,628 yards that season. For the record, Sanders also scored 37 touchdowns that season, all on the ground. Oh, he also did all of this in 11 games.\nIf McCaffrey keeps up his current pace of 253 yards per game, he would break Sanders' record against Cal on Nov. 21. Of course, if Stanford is able to make it to the Pac-12 championship game and the College Football Playoff, McCaffrey could have a shot at breaking 3,000 yards on the season.\nIf Stanford were to make it to the national title game, the Cardinal would play 15 games this season. If McCaffrey were to average just 200 yards of total offense per game, well below his current average, he would get to 3,000 yards.\n(h/t SB Nation )\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2015/10/19/9563387/christian-mccaffrey-trevone-boykin-seth-russell-2015-heisman-trophy"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:52:12.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
