He had signed a four-year, $21.5 million contract to stay with the Lakers, moved in with his hip-hop star girlfriend, Iggy Azalea, and was featured in a Sports Illustrated article that chronicled his self-given persona, Swaggy P.\nOn it, he was awful. Shots were not falling – he shot a career-worst 36.6 percent from the field – and for Young, that meant the rest of his game suffered.\nByron Scott publicly challenged him to either play defense or get comfortable watching from the bench.\n“It was the first time a coach has called me out in the media or, in a larger scale in the media,” Young said. “Because everybody pays attention to the Lakers and L.A. is L.A.”\nSo strained became Young’s relationship with Scott, that the Lakers explored trading him in the offseason. They signed Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams to provide the kind of bench role for which they once counted on Young.\nA week into a new season, however, something seems to be turning for Young and Scott. The coach has praised Young for making a better effort on both ends of the court, as well as with his attitude.\n“I think he’s made strides in those departments that we talked about on both ends of the floor,” Scott said before Young scored 10 points in the Lakers’ preseason opener Sunday. “I’m going to harp on him all season long to continue to get better at it.”\nYoung said Scott is not asking things of him that other coaches did not, but that Scott has gotten through to him.\n“He finds ways to motivate players,” Young said. “And right now I’m very motivated to prove him wrong and prove the world that doubted Swaggy wrong.”\nPart of what is driving Young is the fact that in eight NBA seasons, he has appeared in the playoffs just twice.\n“Even though I’ve been playing good offensively, I just ain’t won nothing man,” Young said. “Whatever it takes to get to the playoffs and win. … I’m tired of being at Dave and Busters or Wingstop watching all the playoffs, you know?”\nPLAN FOR KOBE \nKobe Bryant was held out of practice Monday after playing in his first game since January. On Sunday against the Utah Jazz he scored five points in 12 minutes.\n“He said he felt good,” Scott said. “So we’ll talk tomorrow after shootaround and we’ll formulate a plan on if we’re going to stick with the 12 minutes that we did or if we’re going to amp it up a little bit.”\nScott has said he plans to build Bryant up to a minutes mark both men are comfortable with, but has not revealed what that number might be.\nBROWNS DOWN \nThe Lakers’ injury report grew by two more players Monday when Anthony Brown and Jabari Brown – who, by the way, are not related – both left practice because of injuries. X-rays on Jabari Brown’s right hand were normal as was an MRI on Anthony Brown’s right shoulder.\nBoth are questionable for Tuesday’s game against the Jazz.\nThe manner in which Anthony Brown suffered his shoulder strain seemed to amuse Scott more than it worried him. Scott said Brown ran into a screen set by Robert Sacre – although Sacre denied it, and others said it was Roy Hibbert..\n“It was a good pick, to be honest with you,” Scott said. “It was a great pick. He just happened to just turn right into it and Robert wasn’t moving.\n“You run into a brick wall, sometimes you get hurt.”\nNOTES \nAfter sitting out Sunday because of back spasms, rookie Larry Nance Jr. was a full participant in Monday’s practice and is expected to play Tuesday. … Brazilian Marcelo Huertas, who has been nursing a right hamstring strain, was scheduled to leave the Lakers late Monday to go to Vancouver, B.C., to finalize some immigration documents. He is expected to rejoin the team by Friday.\nContact the writer: boram@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:30:24.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
