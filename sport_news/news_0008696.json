The audit team, besides finding several loopholes in the functioning of the Sports Department, has raised concern over the ignorance of the officials about the submission of documents pertaining to the purchase of various articles worth several lakhs in the past many years. No utilisation certificate for sports material worth Rs 8.77 lakh The department issued various items/sports material, purchased with the budget released to the Chandigarh Sports Council (CSC), to the coaches. However, the audit team found irregularities in these purchases worth Rs 8.77 lakh, as no utilisation certificate was ever issued by the department. Nor was the expenditure attached for audit. Status: The audit team pointed out the anomaly on September 3, 2015, but the department is yet to come up with any document in this regard. The only stock register misplaced, Rs4.95 lakh not accounted for The audit team noticed that cricket material worth Rs 4, 94,745, which had been issued from the main store of the department to a cricket coach during 2014-15, was not accounted for in the respective stock register. “In the absence of non-accounting of the sports goods, the misuse of the goods could not be ruled out,” says the report. The officials concerned disclosed that the stock register had been misplaced. Notably, only one register was maintained for the purpose and no missing report was submitted to the authorities. Status: No comments or reply was made when the matter was brought to the notice of the department. No physical verification of Rs 1.15 cr stock conducted During the checking of the records, it was noticed that the department had purchased sports equipment worth Rs 1.15 crore (as per the expenditure control register). However, it was found that no physical verification of the stock was conducted as per the rule 192(1) and (2) of the GRF. Status: Reason for no physical verification of the stock is still unknown. Utilisation certificate for goods worth Rs 8.27 cr awaited The team noticed that grant in aid of Rs 4.45 crore (2014-15) was released to the CSC. However, the department submitted no utilisation certificate to the authorities. Similarly, Rs 3.82 crore (2010-11) was released to purchase the turf (which was procured recently) but no utilisation certificate was produced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:11:12.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
