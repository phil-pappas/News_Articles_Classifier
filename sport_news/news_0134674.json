He felt his and his teammates’ opportunity to be special was slipping away. \nThat week prior to the club’s road game at Scottsdale, head coach Jim Monaco and his offensive staff decided to hand over the reins of their offensive to Moore. \nThe 5’9 spark plug threw for 1,400 yards as a senior for the Badgers in 2013 but had played mostly wide receiver in his two seasons with the Aztecs. \nThe move has paid off. Moore ran for 122 yards and two touchdowns while throwing for 108 yards to lead Pima to 45-17 victory over Scottsdale. \nHe followed that by completing 8-of-12 passes for 211 yards and running for 68 yards and two more touchdowns in a rain-delayed 34-19 win over Glendale. \nThe Badgers (6-1, 6-1) beat the Aztecs 72-6 last season in Tucson. Snow has won four conference championships including three straight (2006-2008). \nThey are perennially among the Top 10 junior college teams in the country. \nA win for Pima would likely create a three-way tie for first place provided Eastern Arizona (6-2, 5-2) wins Saturday at New Mexico Military Institute. \nThe Aztecs though would have the top-seed in the league's post-season tournament by virtue of their wins over the Badgers and Gila Monsters. \nKickoff is at Noon Tucson time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:37:31.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
