They snapped a three-game losing streak with a 5-3 win over Lehigh Valley at home on Friday, then dropped a 3-1 decision on the road against the same team on Saturday. Here’s the good, bad and ugly: GOOD *** Welcome back, Seth Griffith. It took no time at all for the right winger with the silky mitts to make an impact – three assists on Friday and a curl-and-drag snipe on Saturday that was a thing of beauty. *** Alex Khokhlachev finished the weekend tied for the lead in AHL scoring with 2-9-11 in seven games. He notched three assists on Friday night, then fed Griffith for the PBs’ only goal on Saturday. Koko is tied for the league lead in power play assists with five. *** Frank Vatrano is tied for the AHL lead in goals with eight. He scored a goal and an assist on Friday. *** The P-Bruins went three for four on the power play on Friday and finished the weekend with the top PP in the AHL. They’ve scored 11 times on 30 chances – 36.7 percent. *** Colby Cave scored twice on Friday night and now has four goals in seven games. *** With 1-4-5, Matt Irwin is averaging a point per game. Four of his points have come on the power play. *** Anton Blidh scored his first goal as a North American pro on Friday night. *** Back from Boston, Tommy Cross had two assists on Friday and now has four assists in four games. *** Malcolm Subban is expected to be good to go next weekend after sitting out the first seven games with a lower body injury. BAD *** Providence gave up goals in the first and last minute of the second period on Friday. *** The P-Bruins have given up 24 goals in seven games. Only four teams have allowed more. *** The penalty kill dropped from seventh in the AHL a week ago to 17th after giving up two goals on five penalties over the weekend. *** Anthony Camara left Saturday’s game and didn’t return after taking a punch from Tyrell Goulbourne of Lehigh Valley. *** Of the 58 goalies who have seen action so far in the AHL, Zane McIntyre’s .882 save percentage ranks 44th. UGLY *** The injury list: Austin Czarnik, Brian Ferlin, Ben Sexton, Camara. *** The P-Bruins have given up 24 goals in seven games. Only four teams have allowed more.
