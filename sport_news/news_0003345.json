A big rivalry game, especially for Joe's, where Bergen became their arch-rival after their first meeting in 1965: a game won by BC, 76-0. BC is not as dynamic on offense with Jarrett Guarantano out injured, but Joe's does not have a big play offense, either. BC has had two weeks to work with their dual quarterback system of junior Patrick Holly and sophomore Johnny Langan. This could be a low scoring affair, with the battle of Bergen's defensive line, including Sal Mauro and Frankie Feaster, going against the St. Joe's offensive line, featuring Robert Martin and Jordan Velez. Players to watch for Joe's on defense are LB Louis Acceus and DE Michael Carfagno. Hammonton (6-0) at Delsea (6-0), Friday night. A battle between two unbeatens, with each team scoring over 200 points thus far. Hammonton has scored 223 points behind the running of RB Zac Barnard and RB Mitch Vitali. The defense features Barnard at LB and DT Jonathan Vega. Delsea has accumulated 242 points by mostly running the ball, with 2,383 yards rushing, nearly 400 per game. Their two main threats there are QB Quinn Collins and RB Rashad Williams. The defense has LB Jake Hallowell. Don't be surprised if this is a high scoring affair. Middletown South (6-0) at Brick Memorial (5-1), Friday night. Middletown South, NJ Varsity's #1 ranked large public school, faces #11 Brick Memorial. South is known for their defense and last week I posted their stats; it is now 42 points allowed for the season and 21 points since the first minute of the second period of their opener. Dylan Rogers is a ringleader at linebacker, along with twin brother Cole at DB and fellow LB James McCarthy. Brick Memorial has won five straight after losing the opener and their offense runs the option, with QB Tim Santiago. Brick Memorial has twins of its own in linemen Michael and Anthony Nobile. Since scoring six in their opening loss to Brick, they have scored 203 in their five games since then. Cherokee (4-1) at Shawnee (3-2), Friday night. This is the third consecutive week that Cherokee has been featured here and the second consecutive week Cherokee has a big game with a sister school. Their defense has allowed seven points in their last three games and they received big performances last week from defensive linemen Mike Palowski and Andrew Cardinali, knocking Lenape from the unbeaten. Shawnee has a top quarterback-receiver combo in Mike Welch and WR Anthony Mague and the defense has a four year starter in LB Dave Gajderowicz. Since an opening day loss, where they allowed 49, they have yielded 26 points in four games, including two shutouts. Delbarton (4-2) at Roxbury (6-0), Friday night. Two of the top programs in Morris County provide a Catholic vs. Public matchup. Delbarton has won four straight since starting 0-2 and they miss one of the state's best wide receivers in Andrew Papantonis, out the whole season with a knee injury. Andrew Sanders has helped running the ball and TE/OLB Sam Johnson has been very good on both sides of the ball. The Green Wave has allowed 23 points in their four wins. Roxbury features Grant Dixon, one of the best quarterbacks in the state, passing for 1,222 yards and rushing for 429. RB/DB Craig Roumes and WR/DB Jack Clevenger have been factors on both sides of the ball, with the defense pitching shutouts the last two weeks. Cresskill (4-2) at Hasbrouck Heights (5-1) and Park Ridge (5-1) at Becton (5-1), both Friday night. It was hard to pick between these two games and since the fields are 2-3 miles apart on Route 17, I decided to feature both games. I caught the last quarter of Park Ridge-Cresskill, a game where Cresskill's winning drive took up more than nine minutes, scoring with three seconds left to hand Park Ridge their first loss. First, Cresskill-Heights: Heights' only loss was a one point heartbreaker to Park Ridge, while Cresskill beat Park Ridge by three, with their two losses being to Saddle Brook by three and Becton by four. These two teams have had numerous exciting games against one another in the past and I expect this year to be the same. Becton's only loss is to Heights, 7-0. Not much separates these four teams and you can't go wrong with either game. If you can't decide, I will warn you the parking at Becton leaves a lot to be desired, so Heights may be the one.
