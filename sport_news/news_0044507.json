He said that the duo could continue with their cricket career as long as they feel fit, the Express Tribune reported. \nThe 49-year-old further said that it was Misbah who led his side when they were in trouble few years back. \nAkram also lavished praise on Younis and said that he is the one who could bring stability to the team if he is chosen to play in ODI. \nYounis has scored 8814 runs in 101 Tests, including 30 hundreds and 29 fifties while Misbah has made 4000 runs from 58 Test played. \nYounis also became the fifth Pakistan batsman and 62nd overall to play 100 Tests during the second match of the Test series against Sri Lanka in June. But, Younis have largely been ignored by the selectors in ODIs since mid 2013.
