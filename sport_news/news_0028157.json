The one loss was to Scotland, when the fatigued Brave Blossoms were over-run in the second half just four days after upsetting the Springboks. Wouldn't they love a rematch with the Scots with equal rest. Japan also beat the U.S. Eagles for the first time in the tournament, after losses in 1987 and 2003. \nIt was departing coach Eddie Jones' desire for the Brave Blossoms to leave as the team of the tournament, and after the pool stage, they do. \nThey go home with three wins, having arrived with only one ever previous win in the tournament, in 1991 against Zimbabwe, and attracted unprecedented interest in rugby at home, where millions tuned in to watch their games. \nThey also generated positive interest in the Rugby World Cup they will host in 2019, the first in Asia, after the Japan government put the tournament at risk in midyear by delaying construction of the showpiece stadium in Tokyo so it won't be ready in 2019. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:13:55.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
