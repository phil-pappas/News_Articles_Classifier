It will also include a new academic and dining center for all intercollegiate athletes, about 725 students in 25 sports.\nSo far, the university has raised less than half the funds, about $76.5 million, from donors. Officials say the rest of the construction costs will be financed through long-term debt, and that the Athletics Department will cover those costs.\nThe vote on the project had been delayed for months, in part because of gender equity concerns involving its impact on the track program. Nearly half of the U’s female athletes are on teams that use the track, which will be destroyed to make way for the Athletes Village. After a federal complaint accused the Athletics Department of violating Title IX gender equity laws, the U announced plans in September to build a new competitive track on the main campus. The plan approved by the regents Friday sets aside $20 million in “debt capacity” to cover the new track and related gender-equity issues.\nBeth Goetz, the interim athletic director, said she hopes the project will break ground soon. “We’ll be meeting shortly to figure out the details,” she said. “It will be a quick turnaround.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:20:17.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
