Richard Brown Published: Friday, October 2, 2015 at 4:49 p.m. Last Modified: Friday, October 2, 2015 at 4:49 p.m. \nTAMPA – When the Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Bucs meet for the first time this season Sunday, it won't be the first time the quarterbacks have met. Facts \nCarolina (3-0) at Tampa Bay (1-2) When: Sunday, 1 p.m. TV: FOX (WTVT Channel 13) Radio: WLKF 1430-AM, WDAE 620-AM NFL ON TV 1 p.m. — Carolina at Tampa Bay, FOX (WTVT Channel 13)4 p.m. — Cleveland at San Diego, CBS (WTSP Channel 10)4:25 p.m. — Green Bay at San Francisco, FOX (WTVT Channel 13)8:20 p.m. — Dallas at New Orleans, NBC (WFLA Channel 8) MONDAY 8:15 p.m. — Detroit at Seattle, ESPN \nWhile Jameis Winston was working out at a quarterback training academy in San Diego in the offseason, Carolina quarterback Cam Newton met with the Tampa Bay rookie quarterback and the two developed a friendship. One bit of advice Winston took from his conversations with Newton was to \"be yourself.\" \n“I've talked to Cam numerous times,” Winston said. “He's just a great person for me to look up to and kind of model my style off what he's been through. We've basically been through the same thing – the Heisman, then going to the league. He's definitely a great person to try and seek things to do to better myself.” \nIf anyone knows what Winston is going through, it would be Newton. \nLike Winston, Newton was a former Heisman Trophy winner, who won a BCS National Championship with his college. Like Winston, Newton was drafted No. 1 overall by a team that was coming off of a 2-14 record. And like Winston, there was some baggage from college Newton was carrying when he entered the league. \nThrough it all, Newton has not only survived early struggles in the league but is now thriving. Given a contract extension during the summer that made him part of the $100 million club, Newton has become one of the best dual-threat quarterbacks in the NFL today — arguably the best. \nWhile their road to the NFL may be similar, their style of play is completely opposite. Newton is a big quarterback who runs with the ease of a gazelle. If he gets out in the open field, he can outrun many defensive backs and is definitely big enough to run over them. Winston is also big, but his strength is firing passes from the pocket. He can deftly avoid the rush and break some arm tackles. He can get you a first down scrambling, but he isn't going to outrun too many players. \nThey both can be successful. \n“The biggest thing is patience,” Carolina coach Ron Rivera said. “That was the one thing that was beneficial for us was that we were patient and we understood that. I believe they are handling (Winston) the way, very similar to what we did. They put the young man out there from the beginning. He's a big part of what they are going to do for the future. I think it's now just a matter of time as he develops. We're very fortunate. Our quarterback has developed and we feel very good about the direction we are headed.” \nNewton did it by being himself, overcoming losing seasons and helping lead the Panthers to back-to-back NFC South Division championships. \n“It's something that you just have to learn,” Newton said of being patient. “Jameis, I believe is (21-years-old). I don't view life the same way at the age of 26. …You, just alone, think that that team will make leaps and strides – and they will – but there's more to an NFL team than just one player. \n“You see great players all the time that haven't reached the success of playoff-winning caliber teams, and that's why you come in the league, to win championships. It's just a learning process. It's still taking me time to learn, and he'll learn as well.” \nNOTES \nBucs cornerback Johnthan Banks (knee), tight ends Austin Seferian-Jenkins (shoulder) and Luke Stocker (hip) and center Evan Smith (ankle) did not practice Friday and are listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Running back Doug Martin (knee/quad) practiced fully and is questionable. Also questionable for the game is defensive end George Johnson (neck), defensive tackle Gerald McCoy (shoulder), receiver Russell Shepard (hamstring), tackle Donovan Smith (knee) and safety Major Wright (abdomen). \nReader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.
