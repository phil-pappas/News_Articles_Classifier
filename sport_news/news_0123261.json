The fired workers were all employed by the Riviera, which is run by 40-year-old Jam Productions. Jam also operates the Park West and The Vic Theatre.\n\"In a profanity-laced tirade, Jam's co-owner Jerry Mickelson told legendary stage production manager Jolly Roger that he and his crew were terminated,\" according to the stagehands' statement.\n\"Some of the fellas approached the union â€¦ about representation,\" Roger said. \"Next thing I know, I get a phone call saying we're fired. I've been with the company 30 years, it definitely blindsided me,\" he said.\nMickelson was not available for comment.\nThe workers have filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, according to attorney David Huffman-Gottschling. \"We think their terminations were unlawful and expect the Labor Board will have them reinstated to their positions,\" Huffman-Gottschling said.\ncrshropshire@tribpub.com\nTwitter @corilyns\n Jerry Mickelson Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56294ab3/turbine/ct-jam-productions-stagehands-1023-biz-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:13:31.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
