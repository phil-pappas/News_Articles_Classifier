It means the Bombers will start four import receivers, with Canadian Kris Bastien taking a seat.\n“I'm very excited. I put in a hard week's worth of work, and I'm ready to get on the field and play,” Cone said Thursday. “The coaches have done a great job preparing me and being on the field, getting comfortable with the offence.”\nCone has good speed and dressed for 29 NFL games with the Atlanta Falcons, making 10 special teams tackles and one catch for 12 yards. That grab came against the New York Jets in October 2013. He tried out for the Miami Dolphins this summer, making three catches for 32 yards in the pre-season, but he was let go at the end of camp.\nLast week was the first time Cone had ever seen a CFL game, and now he'll be playing in one since Justin Veltung is on the six game injured list. Life moves pretty quickly sometimes.\n“You never know with injuries and moves,” Cone said. “You just gotta be ready, and I think I am.”\nCone's addition to the starting receiving corps means Winnipeg will go with four import pass catchers for the third time this season.\n“He's big and fast,” head coach Mike O'Shea said. “Hopefully we'll see a physical side, which I think is there.”\nHELLO OUT THERE\nThe wide side receiver position isn't exactly the first option for most quarterbacks, seeing as it's a remarkably long pass to the far side of the field.\nKohlert has 24 catches for 280 yards and a touchdown in 12 starts at the position this season, which are decent numbers for the receiver who has to line up so far away from the pivot.\n“It could always be utilized more, but I forget what the standard is – 1.6 catches per game for 30-something yards,” O'Shea said. “Around the league it is what it is, and it really depends on the defence you're playing, what they're going to allow you to do, and then offensively how you're going to trick with the formations to get a guy closer.”\nMAKING MOVES\nThe Bombers will be making two other roster changes for Saturday's game, in which the Eskimos will be going for their fourth consecutive victory.\nDefensive end Greg Peach, who is still looking for his first sack of the season, won't play due to an undisclosed injury. Derrell Johnson will take his place in the starting lineup, while former University of Manitoba Bisons defensive end Louie Richardson will play his first game of the season after suffering a knee injury in Winnipeg's first pre-season contest.\nThe other switch will have Selvish Capers replacing Sam Longo at left guard.\nNEW BLOOD\nO'Shea said the Bombers are going to be expanding their practice roster shortly.\nCFL teams can add five newcomers to their PR, growing it from 10 to 15 members, for any 30-day period between Sept. 5 and Nov. 8.\nThere were two new players watching practice on Thursday.\nO'SHEA DISAGREES WITH FINE\nJamaal Westerman on Wednesday was fined for being a little too frisky during Calgary's victory formation last Friday night.\nThe Bombers defensive end was flagged for unnecessary roughness on the final play of the game when he took a low dive at the Stampeders offensive line. If there was a football code, blasting off the line during victory formation wouldn't be in it.\nBombers head coach Mike O'Shea, however, doesn't like the idea of the victory formation, which occurs when the winning offence takes a knee to end a game.\n“That's one of the main disagreements I have,” O'Shea said. “Who decides it's victory? For the winning team, for the team that's leading, it's victory formation. For the team that's losing, it's not. It's desperate football, trying to get the ball back.\n“You can't tell the defensive player to stop playing. You can't do it. That doesn't make any sense to me. So just because one side calls it victory ... the officials can never call it that way, because then that would present a bias towards the team with the lead, right? It's not the final whistle.”\nWesterman, who has been fined three times since Aug. 29 for rough or unsportsmanlike behaviour, played at Rutgers under aggressive head coach Greg Schiano, who twice forced an opponent to fumble during victory formation during his 11 years with the Scarlet Knights. O'Shea likes the sound of that.\n“When I see the film I see a guy who refuses to quit,” O'Shea said. “I don't see him trying to put his helmet on someone's knee at the end of the game. I see him reaching for a ball, trying to cause a fumble. That's what he's trying to do.”\nkirk.penton@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/PentonKirk\nBLUE BOMBERS\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers receiver Kevin Cone finds life moves quickly\nBy Kirk Penton , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Thursday, October 01, 2015 09:50 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 01, 2015 10:41 PM EDT\nKevin Cone arrived in Winnipeg last Tuesday, but on Saturday afternoon he'll be in the starting lineup for the Bombers against the Edmonton Eskimos.\nCone will start at the wide side receiver position normally patrolled by Rory Kohlert, who will move inside and play the slot spot closest to the line of scrimmage.
