Jabaal Sheard (ankle), Marcus Cannon (toe), Shaq Mason (knee) and Rufus Johnson (illness) all missed their second practice in a row. With the Patriots last practice coming up on Friday, the availability for those players could be in question come this weekend’s matchup with the New York Jets. Sheard and Cannon suffered their injuries against the Indianapolis Colts. Mason was on the field for the Patriots’ final snap – a kneel down – so it’s unknown when his injury occurred. The injuries to Cannon and Mason are a concern. The Jets have an outstanding defensive line and the Patriots could use all hands on deck. If Cannon can’t go, it would make sense to see Cameron Fleming get the start. With Mason out, the Patriots could start Tre’ Jackson or Ryan Wendell, who still hasn’t made his 2015 debut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:35:05.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
