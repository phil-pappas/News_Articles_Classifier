The degrees of those are to be determined. \nTrading Anthony Duclair, 20, makes it potentially a disaster, and the first-rounder the Rangers gave up sure doesn’t help, on the heels of giving up three first-rounders (plus players) in the Rick Nash and Martin St. Louis deals. \nThe first-rounder they traded to Arizona was strictly made to get the Coyotes to retain half of Yandle’s salary-cap hit. Otherwise there was no chance the Rangers could fit him in last year or this. \nBut the Rangers had to make a trade like that. They were in the Stanley Cup Final the year before, were en route to the Presidents’ Trophy and to becoming a, if not the, favorite to win the Cup last season. In that situation, you push the chips to the middle of the table and look for the piece that gets you over the top. \nYou can question whether Yandle was the right piece. But if the Rangers didn’t move, if Glen Sather and Jeff Gorton and staff sat out the trade deadline with a team that close, it would have been a disservice to their organization and their fans. \nJust because they swung for the fences, that doesn’t mean it works out or it doesn’t. It could be a colossal fail if this is all Yandle contributes and they don’t win a Stanley Cup… and he can walk as a free agent in July. \nIf you want an example… look at the ’94 trade of Tony Amonte for Stephane Matteau and Brian Noonan. That trade worked, and was very acceptable, despite Amonte going on to be a star in the league with Chicago, because the Rangers won the Cup. \nBut what if the Rangers didn’t win Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Final? What if one of the Devils had scored in OT or the second OT? It turned out to be doubly successful because not only did the Rangers win that game, that series and then the Stanley Cup, but also because Matteau scored two double-OT goals in the series, including the clincher in Game 7. \nLast year, what if Yandle or anybody had done something when it was 0-0 in Game 7 vs. Tampa Bay and the Rangers won that series? Granted, with the injuries they had on defense, including Yandle’s shoulder, they were probably not going to beat Chicago in the Stanley Cup Final. \nThe bigger part of the equation is what Duclair turns out to be. Is he another Amonte? He certainly has the speed and skill to be a very good offensive player. \nAre there questions about his makeup, even at this early age? People questioned why he fell to 80th in his draft year. People’s eyebrows were raised when he returned to juniors last year, knowing his NHL season was over, and was lackadaisical enough to be a healthy scratch. There are those who wonder if Arizona will be his last stop, or the second of many. \nSome players with skill never get it. Some take a while (examples: Chris Kreider, J.T. Miller). \nThis much is clear. The Rangers, as Alain Vigneault said Wednesday, think Yandle has more to give. He has been a third-pair defenseman, better than most want to admit, but certainly not as advertised as a star-type player who could run a power play, be a consistent offensive player and a difference-maker. \nTwitter: @RangersReport 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1LPBAlD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:38:42.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
