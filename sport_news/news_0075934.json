We played in Newcastle on Saturday (prior to Porto); we played again on Saturday. \n\"We are losing 24 hours. We have to try to recover that with other ingredients and the ingredients will be the same - fantastic spirit. Let's start from that point.\" \nVilla have now lost seven of their nine Premier League matches this season. \nManager Tim Sherwood, though, saw reasons to be positive following the performance at Stamford Bridge, where a poor Brad Guzan clearance led to Diego Costa's opener and Alan Hutton deflected the ball in for Chelsea's second. \n\"It was encouraging at points in the game,\" he said. \n\"We dominated the game in the first period without opening them up too many times. We have had a few chances. \n\"They have had none except the one we gifted them. It was an uphill struggle after that. \n\"There were positives. We have come to the Bridge and matched them. We haven't sat back and tried to dig in and nick something. \n\"Unfortunately we didn't have that cutting edge which you're going to need to win football matches. \n\"But it's onwards and upwards now.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:22:27.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
