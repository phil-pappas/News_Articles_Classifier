Economou tosses 3 TDs; ’Devs blank Wranglers: River Valley 50, Wickenburg 0 By DANIEL McKILLOP The Daily News MohaveDailyNews.com | 0 comments \nMOHAVE VALLEY — Ryan Economou notched three TD passes and the Dust Devils brought home their fifth shutout in six games en route to a 50-0 rout of the Wranglers during their trip to Wickenburg High School on Friday night. \nThe 7-1 overall, 3-0 in Section III, No. 9-ranked Division IV River Valley High School football squad entered the second period tied at 0-0 with the 3-5 overall, 2-3 in Section III, Division IV Wranglers. \nThen Economou, who completed 10-of-17 passes for 162 yards, threw a 4-yard TD pass to David Larrabee to put River Valley ahead 8-0 after Bryson Foh’s 2-point conversion run with 9:39 left in the second period. \n“Having Larrabee as a receiver is awesome because I know he’s going to come up with the ball every time I throw it,” said Economou by text message. “So, I’m very comfortable throwing him the ball.” \nDevin Anderson, who gained 63 yards on 12 carries, bulled his way into the end zone to put River Valley up 15-0 after Fohs’ PAT at 6:28. \nEconomou’s 37-yard TD pass to Larrabee put RVHS ahead 21-0 after the 2-point pass failed at 3:19. \n“(We) practice hard everyday,” said Larrabee by email. “Our timing is improving, which helps a lot, and his throws are getting better. \n“I am just trying to (do) everything to win.” \nThe fleet-footed Larrabee went on to record four receptions for 81 yards. \n“I think Larrabee has come into his own,” Dust Devils co-head coach and defensive coordinator Mark Ruckle said. \nRuckle said he and Dust Devils co-head coach offensive coordinator Paul Duchaineau were talking about how “Larrabee has become a smarter football player. \n“He’s figuing out what he can do to the corner(back). \n“He’s going back to Paul on the sideline saying, ‘Hey coach, I can beat this guy with the stop and go or I can do this.’ ” \nRuckle said Larrabee also is a “great athlete.” \nRVHS’ defense got into the scoring act when Enrique Porter scooped up a fumble before rumbling into the end zone, which made it 28-0 after Fohs’ PAT with 10:31 remaining in the third period. \n“I was getting off a defender when I saw that the quarterback lost control of the ball,” Porter said. “Then Jacob Lee hitting him causing the ball to bounce towards my direction, and I just fielded the ball and ran it in for the touchdown.” \nEconomou’s 10-yard TD pass to Jesse Bravin put RVHS in front 35-0 at 6:46. \n“Having Bravin as my tight end is also great because he has been very reliable, and he and I are getting great chemistry, as well as Larrabee and myself. \n“But we couldn’t be as explosive without our offensive line. They’ve been really reliable and they have done really well this year and I would like to give a shout-out as well.” \nTristen Dozier’s 11-yard TD run and Fohs’ PAT put RVHS ahead 42-0 with 11:15 left in the fourh period. \nAnderson’s 3-yard TD run, Nick Fraser’s 2-point reception conversion from Economou off a bad snap, put the Dust Devils ahead 50-0 at 4:38. \nRuckle said the Dust Devils’ front seven played well. \nPorter, Chance Miller, Steven Holmes, Logan Cummings, Lee, Luke Regan and Brent Vegas comprise the front seven, Ruckle said. “It was those guys up front who set the stage for the game,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:24:22.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
