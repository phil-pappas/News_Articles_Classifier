So, who else comes into focus for Game 4 of the National League division series?\nMORE: Best NLDS photos | Kershaw gets do-over\n1 Yoenis Cespedes\n© Provided by Sporting News The Mets’ prime trade deadline acquisition went 3-for-5 with a game-icing three-run homer in Game 3, following his dinger in Game 2, and the prospect of Cespedes being locked in after staggering to a .218/.279/.327 finish with no homers in his last 16 regular-season games should terrify the Dodgers.\nWhat’s more, Cespedes started New York’s four-run rally in the second inning on Monday with a ludicrous infield single — a ball hit hard and right at Jimmy Rollins, who was playing deep in a shift, but still, hard and right at him. Cespedes beat the throw. He is capable of doing something incredible every time he steps on the diamond.\n“He shows you what he can do,” Mets manager Terry Collins said. “The guy’s electrifying on the field. He can do anything he wants, and that kind of hustle shows that he’s determined to, again, get us on, let us ride his back, and he’s a dangerous player.”\nCespedes is 0 for 6 in his career against Kershaw, including Game 1 of this series. He has not had more than seven hitless plate appearances against any pitcher he has faced in the major leagues.\n2 Don Mattingly\n© Provided by Sporting News The Dodgers manager looked smart for bumping Alex Wood from the rotation to go with Kershaw on short rest in one way already: Wood gave up four runs in two innings of relief in Game 3. Los Angeles will be confident with Kershaw on the mound, too, which is important.\nStill, there will be hard focus on Mattingly and how long he decides to stick with Kershaw in an elimination game. Last year, he left the southpaw in just long enough to give up a three-run homer that decided the game in St. Louis. The skipper has to make sure that if Kershaw shows signs of fatigue, he gets him out, even if the matchup might appear favorable, and even though he got burned in Game 1 bringing in Pedro Baez.\nAlso, will Mattingly tap Chase Utley at some point and get the longtime Mets tormentor involved?\n3 Adrian Gonzalez\n© Provided by Sporting News Gonzalez’s home run off Bartolo Colon in the seventh inning of Game 3 had no bearing on the outcome of the game, already a blowout at that point, but it ended a run of 13 straight games without a dinger for the Los Angeles first baseman.\nThe Dodgers need more offense out of Gonzalez, their top power threat. Facing a left-handed starter in Steven Matz is a challenge, but Gonzalez did hit .294/.346/.436 against southpaws this season. Even though his power is almost exclusively on display against right-handers, getting on base in front of Justin Turner would be massive.\n4 David Wright\n© Provided by Sporting News After going 0 for 3 on Monday, albeit with two walks (one intentional), Wright is at 1-for-10 for the postseason. As well as the bottom of the New York order did in Game 3, Wright and Cespedes are the two righty bats at the top of the lineup against Kershaw, double-decker sandwiched between Curtis Granderson, Daniel Murphy and Lucas Duda.\nThe Mets cannot count on the supporting cast carrying them for a second straight night, and there is only so much that you can expect from left-handed hitters against Kershaw other than hoping and praying. Plus, there’s the cosmic sense that for the Mets to advance, Wright should be involved in a big moment. Now is his chance for just that.\n5 Wilmer Flores\n© Provided by Sporting News The man who took over for the injured Ruben Tejada went 2 for 3 with a pair of runs scored in his first career playoff start. With another good night, a big moment in a clinching game, he can cement his status as a folk hero in Flushing forever.\nJust as importantly as what Flores does with the bat, he's looked very steady at shortstop, nothing like the player who seemed to have no business at the position early in the year. Action seems to find Flores one way or another, and when he is able to deliver, the Mets are much better for it.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657748-mkb-playoffs-2015-nlds-national-league-division-series-photos-cardinals-cubs-dodgers-mets", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-13/mlb-playoffs-2015-dodgers-mets-clayton-kershaw-steven-matz-travis-darnaud-elimination-game", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:54:11.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
