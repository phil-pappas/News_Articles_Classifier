You definitely have that in the back of your mind.\" \nThe start of Big Ten play offers an opportunity to build off any positives from a 2-2 start in nonconference play and a chance to work through any of the negatives. With league playing getting into full swing, the Terps know what looms ahead. \n\"Tone, it kind of changes, but you always have to play with a great intensity, which we have to get better on as far as what happened last week,\" middle linebacker Jermaine Carter Jr. said. \"We have to be better than what we did, but the tone, it doesn't really change much. You always want to play with a high tempo and things like that.\" \nLocksley details Prince, Garman's progress \nAfter Mike Minter 's labrum injury forced Maryland to re-shuffle its offensive line before the West Virginia, the Terps reverted back to the one they expected to have when camp opened in August. The results were mixed, with the unit allowing its first sacks of the season and allowing the Mountaineers to put pressure on the quarterback, but Ross racked up 130 yards. \nRedshirt freshman Damian Prince made his first career start against at right tackle against West Virginia, and offensive coordinator Mike Locksley only expects the former five-star recruit to improve. \n\"For a first start, I thought he did a pretty good job,\" Locksley said Wednesday. \"There's some things that he could be a lot cleaner on, not just Damian, but as a unit. I thought Damian competed, played a whole game there at right tackle, didn't have a whole lot of mistakes, played with some good energy and effort. It's a good game, a good start for him. Obviously something we hope he can build on.\" \nPrince, a 6-foot-3, 328-pound Forestville native, will have his hands full this week against Michigan's defensive front. \nLocksley was also able to comment on backup quarterback Daxx Garman 's Maryland debut for the first time Wednesday. Garman, a transfer from Oklahoma State, made his first appearance for the Terps late in the third quarter of the loss at West Virginia. He broke the Mountaineers shutout with a 46-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jahrvis Davenport , but also took a late sack and threw an interception on the last play of the game. \nIt's been an uphill battle for Garman to get up to speed, but Locksley said he's continuing to see progress from the senior. \n\"I definitely have seen Daxx become more comfortable in our system,\" Locksley said. \"Of the three guys, he's our one guy that's had the least experience in it, and I see the improvement day-to-day, week-to-week. He came in and did a good job on a vertical route, hit Jahrvis for his first touchdown. He also took a sack in quick game where we've done a pretty good job of getting rid of the football and not taking sacks. So definitely, up-and-down but I have seen the improvement of him having a little more comfortable in the system.\" \nWeather cancels pregame show \nThe Big Ten Network postponed its scheduled \"BTN Football Pregame\" broadcast at Maryland because of the forecasted inclement weather from Hurricane Joaquin, Maryland announced Wednesday morning. \nThe network made its decision because of \"safety concerns for the fans and the production crew and the uncertainty surrounding the storm's path.\" Hurricane Joaquin reached hurricane strength Wednesday morning. Its forecast is uncertain. \nMaryland plans to follow its in normal protocol for severe weather, a school spokesman said Wednesday. The Terps' matchup with Bowling Green in early September had a lengthy weather delay because of lightning in the area. \nThe Big Ten Network hopes to return to College Park in the future for another Maryland even. \nBig Ten Network studio host Dave Revsine , president Mark Silverman , analysts Howard Griffith and Christy Winters-Scott , and Maryland athletic director Kevin Anderson were scheduled to participate in a panel at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism on Thursday night, but that event is canceled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:01:42.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
