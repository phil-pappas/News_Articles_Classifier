Kontor said Danekas outkicked Jensen at the end of the race. \nThe two Eagle freshmen, Zach Pauley and Beau Hines, broke 19 minutes and finished 29th and 30th, respectively. \nAs a team, the Eagles were second behind Minden. \n“We’re disappointed yes, but we qualified,” Kontor said. \nShe expects the Eagles to be in contention for another state championship Friday. Masco and Jensen have run at state all four years, while Danekas has been in the field three times and Aidan Pauley, who finished 35th, has run at state twice. \nAidan Pauley has been battling health issues and was in a lot of pain over the first mile and then panicked a little, Kontor said. \n“Everyone else picked it up,” she said. \nMinden, Columbus Scotus, Mitchell and Sidney also have solid teams that will challenge the Eagles. \n“So many things can happen at state,” Kontor said. “There’s a lot of stress, but it’s exhilarating because it’s state.” \nThe Eagles will run at 1 p.m. Friday, Oct. 23, at Kearney Country Club. \nThe Milford girls didn’t have the same success at districts. Milford’s top finisher, Savannah Bontrager, was 17th, with Abbie Reitz finishing 18th and Hayley Bogue 20th. \nKontor said Bontrager improved her time by almost a minute, but still finished in the same position. \nShe said Reitz was very disappointed because she felt she could run well enough to make the state field. \nDani Gropp finished 26th, Hannah Compton 27th and Kaylee Scdoris 28th. \n“We ran the race we wanted,” Kontor said, adding that Boone Central/Newman Grove, which won the girls’ team title, is the top team in the state. \nMilford finished fourth in the team standings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:33:38.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
