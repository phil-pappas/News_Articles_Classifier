He also took his regular spot on the second power-play unit, though he did switch out at times with David Pastrnak.\nTime will tell if his return will come on Saturday or it's pushed off until next Wednesday when the B's host the Flyers, which would give him an extra four days of rest.\n“It was good to get out there and have a full practice with the guys. I guess we'll see how it goes tomorrow,” said Marchand. “I have to be cleared and I'm still trying to figure that out. We're just taking that step by step. Now it's just day-to-day.”\nHe believes this situation is moving in the right direction.\n“I feel pretty good,” said Marchand. “You've got to take it day-to-day because things arise later in the day and every 24 hours you've got to check in. I've been feeling pretty good. I'm hoping to get back pretty soon.”\nMarchand has been concussed “a couple” of times before, but he wasn't sure how many times. He said balancing an athlete's natural desire to get back in the lineup with being prudent can be a challenge.\n“It's tough because you want to be back as fast as possible, but at the same time you're dealing with your health and your life,” said Marchand. “I want to be out there, but at the same time it's best to make sure you're 100 percent instead of 90, because the last thing I want to do is get hit again and be out for a longer period of time. It's is tough, but you've got to take it slow.”\nMarchand's return, whether it comes Saturday or at a later date, will have a ripple effect on the lineup and, right now, it appears as though it could affect Brett Connolly the most. Connolly's been taking Marchand's spot on the line with Patrice Bergeron and Loui Eriksson for the last two games and picked up his first point of the season in the win on Wednesday in Colorado. He remained a fourth on that line again in Friday's practice, rotating in and out. Meanwhile, he's lost his spot on the third line – for now at least – as that unit has taken off with Chris Kelly's addition and Jimmy Hayes' move to his natural wing on the right side.\nThe right fit still has to be found for Connolly.\n“Absolutely,” said coach Claude Julien. “You've got to find the right fit and, as you know, Kells has stepped into that third and that third line has really taken off and seems to be having some good chemistry there. There's no reason for me to break up that line right now. There's decisions to be made here on what we want to do and which direction we want to go with as far as our lines are concerned.”\nAnd Julien's assessment of Connolly's game thus far?\n“He's had some good stretches,” said Julien. “He's been a strong player along the wall, but there's been a little bit of inconsistency in his game. There's part of it where I think he's still trying to find himself a little bit. We've got to remember that he didn't play much with us last year, he only played (five) games, so he' still has to be in that category of new players trying to find their way. We've got to keep working with this guy because the potential seems to be there. The assets that he has – he can shoot the puck, he's a good strong skater, he has good size, not afraid to battle along the walls – we've got fine-tune his game a little bit here to the areas that are going to help us.”\nFor his part, Connolly knows he's in a dogfight to stay in the lineup.\n“That's what's going to make us better and there's always competition. Everybody's trying to play and get in the lineup,” said Connolly. “You've got to be good every game, you've got to be good defensively and you've got play hard. And you've got to chip in. It's only going to make our team better with the competition amongst the lines.”\nConnolly's been pleased with the opportunities he's been getting, but as a projected goalscorer he needs to bury those chances.\n“For me, I think I just have to get that first one and then once you start feeling confident usually they'll start going in four you. I just have to stick with it here,” said Connolly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:39:40.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
