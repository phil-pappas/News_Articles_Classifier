The Cardinals and assured themselves of the best record in the majors this season despite losing several stars to injury for long stretches. \nHeyward’s shot off Bobby LaFromboise, who replaced an ineffective Charlie Morton (9-9), gave St. Louis an early six-run lead. Tyler Lyons (3-1) had little trouble making it hold up as the Cardinals reached the 100-win plateau for the ninth time. \nSt. Louis players jogged out of their dugout to the infield in a businesslike celebration of their fifth straight postseason berth. Their season-long run atop baseball’s most competitive division — and the ease in which the team did it — is all the more stunning considering the obstacles it had to overcome. \nThe Cardinals held off the Pirates and the Chicago Cubs even though ace Adam Wainwright, sluggers Matt Holliday and Matt Adams and high-profile relievers Jordan Walden and Matt Belisle spent large chunks of the season on the disabled list. \nWainwright returned from a torn left Achilles to pitch one inning of mop-up duty during an 8-2 loss in the opener.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:11:15.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
