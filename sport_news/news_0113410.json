It was the 36th shutout of his career. He posted a 25-save shutout against the New York Rangers on Oct. 15, and allowed one goal on 22 shots in a 4-1 win over Detroit on Saturday night to earn NHL first star of the week honors. \nHis save of the night was a spectacular glove effort early in the second frame on Vladimir Tarasenko , who was held off the score sheet for the first time this season. \nIslanders 4, Blue Jackets 0: Jaroslav Halak stopped 37 shots for his 37th career shutout to lead visiting New York to its fourth straight win. Nikolay Kulemin gave the Islanders the lead late in the first period, and Thomas Hickey , Cal Clutterbuck and John Tavares all scored in the third period. \nDevils 3, Coyotes 2: Travis Zajac had a goal, two assists and set up Adam Larrson’s game-winner 43 seconds into overtime to lift host New Jersey, which won its second straight overtime game under new head coach John Hynes after opening the season 0-3-1. \nPenguins 3, Panthers 2: Evgeni Malkin scored on the power play in overtime and Sidney Crosby picked up his first goal of the season to lead host Pittsburgh. Crosby netted his first three points of the season on the first-period goal and two assists. \nStars 2, Flyers 1: Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn each had a goal and an assist as visiting Dallas won its fourth straight. Antti Niemi made 34 saves to improve to 3-1 in four career starts against the Flyers. Niemi was in because starting goalie Kari Lehtonen is 1-10-2 in 13 games against Philadelphia. \nPredators 5, Lightning 4: Filip Forsberg scored the only goal of the shootout to help Nashville beat visiting Tampa Bay. James Neal scored twice and Mike Fisher and Shea Weber also scored for the Predators, winners of five of six. Nashville’s past two wins have come via a shootout. Steven Stamkos , Nikita Kucherov, Ryan Callahan and Erik Condra scored for the Lightning, who have dropped three of four. \nCapitals 6, Flames 2: Nicklas Backstrom scored twice and Alex Ovechkin added a goal and an assist for Washington in its first road game of the season. Andre Burakovsky, T.J. Oshie and Jason Chimera also scored, and Evgeny Kuznetsov added three assists. The goal was Ovechkin’s fourth of the season, and 900th career point. \nBlackhawk down: Chicago’s Duncan Keith , 32, had right knee surgery, sidelining the top defenseman for the Stanley Cup champions for four to six weeks. Keith, a two-time Norris Trophy winner, has two assists in six games this season. The team said he had a meniscus tear repaired. “I don’t think it was a defining blow, but it was bothering him,” head coach Joel Quenneville said. Keith, a two-time Olympic gold medalist with Team Canada , has led Chicago in average ice time for 10 consecutive seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:55:44.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
