Ask the experts! \nFirst quarter \nScoring summary \nOSU: Elliott 2 rin (Willoughby kick), :10. Drive: Nine plays, 42 yards, 4:03. Key plays: Elliott 11 pass from Barrett on third-and-9 from the Rutgers 41; Thomas 20 pass from Barrett for first down at the 12; Elliott 1 run in third-and-1 from the 3; he scored over left guard on the next play. Ohio State 7, Rutgers 0\nAnalysis: Feeling-out process \nOhio State managed to avoid being shut out in the first quarter for the second week in a row, and from falling behind its opponent for the fourth consecutive time in Big Ten play, but just barely. The Buckeyes scored with only 10 seconds left in the quarter when Ezekiel Elliott burst through a hole over left guard for his 12th rushing touchdown of the season. By all rights, that should have made the score 7-3, but Rutgers’ Kyle Federico banged a 29-yard field-goal attempt off the left upright. Rutgers had moved smartly after taking the opening kickoff, going from its 25-yard line to the OSU 11 in 11 plays, mixing passes from Chris Laviano (22 yards) and runs from Paul James (35 yards). After Federico’s gift miss, the Buckeyes went from the 20 to the Rutgers 20 before quarterback J.T. Barrett lost a fumble after being hit on a third-down scramble. Ohio State forced a punt, however, and Jalin Marshall had a 29-yard punt return to set up the scoring drive. Barrett had two key completions on the drive, an 11-yard pass to Elliott on third-and-9 and a 20-yard bullet to Michael Thomas for a first down at the Rutgers 12.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards \nSecond quarter \nScoring summary \nOSU: Thomas 50 pass from Barrett (Willoughby kick), 6:48. Drive: Four plays, 80 yards, 2:12. Key plays: Miller 10 pass from Barrett for first down at the OSU 34; Barrett 16 run for first down at the 50; on the next play, Barrett passed to the right sideline to Thomas, who put a move on Wharton, cut to the middle of the field and was gone. Ohio State 14, Rutgers 0\nOSU: Barrett 2 run (Willoughby kick), 3:02. Drive: Four plays, 65 yards, 1:28. Key plays: Miller 45 pass from Barrett for first down at the Rutgers 18; Miller 16 run for first-and-goal at the 2; on the next play, Barrett took the snap and moved to his right along the line until a path to the end zone opened. Ohio State 21, Rutgers 0\nAnalysis: Assuming command \nOhio State in the second quarter looked a lot more like the nation’s No. 1 team than it had looked in the first 15 minutes. The Buckeyes scored on two of their first three possessions, but somewhat curiously didn’t go for the throat when they could have buried Rutgers in the final minute of the first half. As it was, OSU’s 21-0 lead had a somewhat-safe feel; the offense was mostly rolling even though leading rusher Ezekiel Elliott was bottled up and the defense allowed a few big plays but nothing that threatened to remove the zero from the scoreboard. Ohio State was quick-strike on its two scoring drives – 80 yards in four plays on the first and 65 yards in four plays for the second. Michael Thomas had the game’s second TD when he caught J.T. Barrett’s simple out pass on the right sideline, made a nifty move on Isaiah Wharton and found an open lane to the end zone. The next touchdown was sparked by Barrett’s 45-yard bomb pass to Braxton Miller, which allowed the Buckeyes to move from their 37 to the Rutgers 18. Miller ran 16 yards on the play and Barrett ran a hurry-up sneak for the final 2 yards and the score. Ohio State then forced another Scarlet Knights punt – their fifth of the half – and took over on the OSU 17 with 54 seconds left in the half and all three timeouts. But coach Urban Meyer had Barrett take a knee on two straight plays to run out the clock; the Buckeyes were to receive the second-half kickoff, anyway.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nThird quarter \nScoring summary \nOSU: Samuel 30 pass from Barrett (Willoughby kick), 13:43. Drive: Four plays, 76 yards, 1:47. Key plays: Elliott runs of 27, 6 and 13 yards to move the ball to the Rutgers 30; on the next play, Barrett had his choice of open receivers and threw deep to Samuel, who made a nice catch. Ohio State 28, Rutgers 0\nOSU: Barrett 10 run (Willoughby kick), 8:24. Drive: Ten plays, 72 yards, 3:48. Key plays: Thomas 12 pass from Barrett for first down at the OSU 43; Elliott 13 pass from Barrett for first down at the Rutgers 37; Elliott 2 run on fourth-and-1 from the 26; two plays after a pass-interference penalty moved the ball to the 11, Barrett started left on a quarterback counter and cut back to the end zone. Ohio State 35, Rutgers 0\nOSU: Marshall 1 pass from Barrett (Willoughby kick), 4:34. Drive: Nine plays, 44 yards, 3:38. Key plays: Marshall 11 pass from Barrett for first down at the Rutgers 33; Elliott 3 run on third-and-1 from the 24; Marshall 10 pass from Barrett for a first down at the 6; on first-and-goal from 1 after a penalty, Marshall accepted a shovel pass from Barrett, acted as if he would throw again, then decided to cut upfield and into the end zone. Ohio State 42, Rutgers 0\nAnalysis: The hammer comes down \nOhio State may have left some points on the field in the final minute of the first half, when coach Urban Meyer decided not to press the issue and instead had his Buckeyes take a knee. Not so in the third quarter. Ezekiel Elliott, limited to 15 yards on nine carries in the first half took advantage of an obvious coaching adjustment at halftime and Ohio State cruised to touchdowns on all three possessions in the quarter. Elliott rushed for 27 yards on the first play of the second half and finished the quarter with 87 yards. J.T. Barrett accounted for all three TDs, throwing scoring passes of 30 yards to Curtis Samuel and 1 yard to Jalin Marshall sandwiched around a 10-yard touchdown run on a quarterback counter. The OSU defense was doing its part, as well. Rutgers’ first two drives in the second half resulted in a three-and-out and a first-play interception of QB Chris Laviano by Gareon Conley. As the quarter ended, the Scarlet Knights were facing a third-and-25 from their 37.\nFourth quarter \nScoring summary \nOSU: Elliott 55 run (Willoughby kick), 13:42. Drive: Two plays, 54 yards, :42. Key plays: Conley punt block gave OSU possession at its 46; on second-and-11, Elliott took a handoff and blasted through a huge hole to paydirt. Ohio State 49, Rutgers 0\nRUT: Patton 4 pass from Rettig (Federico kick), :13. Drive: Ten plays, 90 yards, 4:04. Key plays: Agudosi 58 pass from Rettig for first down on the OSU 4; Rettig hit Patton in the back of the end zone on third down. Ohio State 49, Rutgers 7\nAnalysis: Win secured, shutout lost \nOhio State probably deserved its second shutout of the season, but a late-game Rutgers scoring drive generated by backup quarterback Hayden Rettig took care of that. Still, the Buckeyes continued their dominance throughout much of the final quarter. It began with OSU’s defense forcing a Rutgers punt, which Gareon Conley partly blocked to give the Buckeyes possession at their 44. Two plays later, Elliott steamed 55 yards through a huge hole to the end zone, topping 100 yards for the 13th straight game. After forcing another punt, Cardale Jones led the reserves onto the field. He drove them 53 yards in 15 clock-consuming plays but Ohio State turned the ball over on downs when Warren Ball was tackled for a 3-yard loss on fourth-and-3 from the 7. Rutgers then went 90 yards in 10 plays, the big one a 58-yard pass from Rettig to Carlton Agudosi to move the ball to the OSU 4. On third down from there, Rettig passed to Andre Patton in the back of the end zone to spoil the shutout.
