(AP) - An Oregon high school quarterback has been suspended from school because officials said he inappropriately touched another player during practice. \nWest Salem High principal Ken Phillips declined to discuss the incident, but freshman quarterback Garrett Moore told the Statesman Journal (http://is.gd/PylRKt ) it happened when he was taking snaps under center last week. \nHe said he inadvertently tickled the center while moving his hands. He said the center later kneed him in the crotch. \nMoore says an assistant principal called him in for a pair of meetings Tuesday and gave him a three-day suspension. A written notice says it’s for inappropriately touching another student during practice. \nHis mother, Tamara Moore, says the situation is absurd and she plans to appeal the suspension. \n___ \nInformation from: Statesman Journal, http://www.statesmanjournal.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:29:48.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
