Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 6:00 am | Updated: 9:18 am, Thu Oct 15, 2015. Munson, Morrison set for state tournament Herald Staff Report The Clinton Herald \nCLINTON — McKenna Munson was thrilled Monday when she qualified for this weekend's Illinois Class A girls golf state tournament. She could find only one drawback. \n\"It's kind of a bummer that homecoming is that weekend,\" Munson, a senior at Fulton High School, said after tying for fourth place with an 85 at the sectional meet in Spring Valley, Illinois. \"I'm really happy that I qualified for state.\" \nMunson will join 109 other golfers from around the state at Red Tail Run Golf Course in Decatur, Illinois. Morrison's Jaeden Workman is one of the other 109, while the Mustangs' Noah Hogue heads to Prairie Vista Golf Course in Bloomington, Illinois, for the Class 1A boys state meet. \nAlthough Munson will have to miss the Steamers' homecoming football game against Rockridge, she doesn't plan to miss homecoming altogether. \n\"I'm going to make it back for the dance,” she said. \"I was a little disappointed, so I won't have to miss everything.\" \nMunson will make her state meet debut on the 10th hole at 10:09 a.m. Friday, playing in the third-to-last foursome of the day. She played in one of the later groups Monday at Spring Creek Golf Course and found that time to her liking. \n\"I liked teeing off later because it was more dry,\" she said. \"Usually when you're playing in the morning it's really dewy and wet and slower. The greens got a chance to dry out with the wind.\" \nMunson heads to Red Tail Run with little knowledge of the course designed by Raymond Floyd. The qualifiers did have an opportunity for a practice round on the 5,400-yard course today. \n\"I heard it's really beautiful, and my mom said it's kind of a tight course,\" Munson said. \"We'll find out ... as long as I can keep my drive on the fairway, I'll be good. My drive set off the mood of the hole, and just get onto the green, and not three-putt.\" \nMunson had to leave early this morning for Decatur for a 10:30 tee time before the real action begins. \n\"I'm going to look for where to aim on each hole,\" Munson said. \nWorkman, a junior, tees off at 9:24 a.m., also on the 10th hole. She has some familiarity with the course after tying for 27th at last year's meet with a 168. Workman advanced in a sudden-death playoff for the final four berths after five players tied with 89s Monday at Spring Creek. \nThe top three teams and the top 10 individuals not from those teams advanced from each sectional. \nHogue also will start on the back nine, teeing off at 9:42 a.m. Like Workman, he was forced to earn his spot in a five-way playoff.
