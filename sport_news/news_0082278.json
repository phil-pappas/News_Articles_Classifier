Richlands got goals from Kevon Pascoe and Jordan McCuiston to build a two-goal lead and then held off a late Jacksonville surge to defeat the Cardinals 2-1. The victory for the Wildcats (10-7, 4-3) avenged a 2-1 loss at Jacksonville last month and also moved Richlands one-half game behind the Cardinals (6-4-4, 4-2) for third place in the conference, which gets three guaranteed spots in the NCHSAA playoffs. It also marked the Wildcats’ fifth consecutive win following a 4-0 loss at Swansboro. “We’ve been playing well and we are starting to get into our roles a little bit,” Richlands coach Mike Roed said. “We are starting to play a little bit more as a group.” Jacksonville saw its three-game winning streak end. The Cardinals entered in a virtual tie for first place in the league with White Oak (13-4, 6-1) and Swansboro (12-4, 3-1), but now sit in third place. “We know we are going to get everybody’s best game,” Jacksonville coach Dave Miller said. “They were the better team tonight, and they took it to us early and we never recovered. We were better the last 15 minutes of the game and we put a lot of pressure on them, but we couldn’t find an equalizer.” Trailing 2-0, Jacksonville cut Richlands’ lead in half with 17:36 left in the game when Justin Kiser scored off an assist from Michael Sherman. The Cardinals had two more shots at the goal with one being blocked by a defender and another saved by goalkeeper Zach Pierce. Jacksonville’s final look was a 25-yard shot that sailed over the goal with 35 seconds remaining. “We didn’t start picking up the intensity until we got down two,” Miller said. Pascoe, a senior defender, gave Richlands a 1-0 lead with 11:35 left in the first half. He scored on a rebound shot after McCuiston’s 26-yard direct kick deflected off goalie Chris Sberna, who was in goal because the Cardinals’ top two goalkeepers were sidelined with injuries. “Jordan took a shot, the keeper fumbled it and I finished it,” Pascoe said. “I knew they didn’t have their starting keeper and so we had to test him a little bit.” McCuiston, a senior, extended the lead to 2-0 just 8:57 into the second half. Leading scorer Roman Eddleman eluded three defenders to work the ball up the field before he sent a short diagonal pass to the right side to McCuiston, who finished the chance. Page 2 of 2 - Eddleman thought he had made it 3-0 about nine minutes later, but his shot from inside the 18-yard line hit off the right post, trickled to the left and hit the other post before being possessed by the Cardinals. McCuiston had a foot in each of the Wildcats’ goals, but the man of the match was Pascoe, who appeared to be all over the pitch, spearheading Richlands’ defensive backline and also helping on the attack. Pascoe went down hard with 23:43 left in the match after he was fouled as he dribbled the ball out of his team’s defensive third, but he didn’t leave the field. “Kevon is a special player,” Roed said. “He’s our cross country runner and he brings a lot of pace and excitement to the game while playing in the back. He just did good, but that’s typical Kevon.” Unlike the previous meeting with Jacksonville, Richlands managed to limit a majority of the Cardinals’ attack. Jacksonville had two shots on frame from outside the 18-yard line in the first 14 minutes with one hitting off the right post. They were the only legitimate looks in the first half for JHS, although the Cardinals picked it up down the stretch. “I think we got right on them and forced them to play wide,” Roed said. “They didn’t go up the middle tonight whereas last time they did. We changed a little personnel by putting Neako (Ramirez) on Michael Sherman, having Kevon on the other side and Kenrick (Pascoe) on Michael Chin. We marked them up a little bit.” As a result, the Wildcats earned a big win to stay alive in the conference. “The top four or five teams in this conference, on any given night, it can happen,” Roed said. “I think each team has to play well, and we’ve been playing well, especially at home.” Jacksonville 0 1 – 1 Richlands 1 1 – 2 GOALS –J: Kiser.
