I expect a very good, intense game.\" \nTech (15-1-2) is coming off an overtime shootout victory over Moorhead. The score was tied 0-0 after overtime. The Tigers out-shot the Spuds 15-3 in the second half. \n\"The main thing is, my kids need to find the net,\" Viswanathan said. \"We had plenty of shots on goal. \n\"But sometimes, the ball's not going in.\" Buy Photo \nTech's Jakob Alessio and Grant Zwilling of Alexandria try to control the ball Sept. 10 at Husky Stadium in St. Cloud. Tech is the top seed in Section 8-2A. (Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com) \nRogers (16-1-1) beat Maple Grove 5-4 in the other semifinal. \nThe Royals have one of the top goal scorers in the state in Trevor Klink. The senior has three goals and three assists in two playoff games. In 16 regular-season games, he had 26 goals and 19 assists for the Royals, according to www.MNSoccerHub.com. \n\"He is very good,\" Viswanathan said. \nThe Royals, who won the Mississippi 8 Conference, also get a lot of offense from Matt Carik and Logan Olkon. \nTech is in the section final for the second straight year. The Tigers lost to eventual state Class 2A champion Anoka 1-0 in last season's section championship. The Tornadoes, who are in a different section this year, gave Tech its only loss this season, 1-0. \nThe Tigers are led in scoring by Mohamed Abdi, a ninth-grader. Khalid Gelani, a junior, also is big scorer for the Tigers. \nTech deploys a disciplined passing game and is solid in the midfield and defensively.

(Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com) \nThe Tigers are led by seniors Mohamud Aden, Kaleb Woodman, Ethan Gray, Abdirashid Abdirahman and Najib Ahmed. \n\"I expect a physical game,\" Viswanathan said. \nTech last made the state tournament in 2008. It was Viswanathan's first season as head coach. There are many differences in the two teams, he said. \n\"That was a group that I had known before I became the head coach,\" he said. \"I knew them from when they were playing travel soccer. \n\"This team has a lot of character. They really want it (a state berth) bad. I can see them going far. But we have to take it one game at a time and Rogers is the next step.\" \nViswanathan said he believes playing at Husky Stadium will help his team. It has a regulation size soccer field and is played on turf, which accentuates Tech's speed. \n\"We are a passing team and we like to play as wide as we can,\" Viswanathan said. \"I'm looking forward to the game.\" \nRematch for Bulldogs \nBecker's closest regular-season football game was against Zimmerman, a 29-22 Bulldog victory. Those two meet at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Becker's Eppard Field in the Section 6-4A semifinals. \nIt's one of the big games in the area Tuesday night as the section playoffs resume. \n\"Of the eight games we've played, they've probably played us the toughest,\" Becker head coach Dwight Lundeen said. \"I really like their team. \n\"They have a good mixture of size and speed and they're very-well coached.\" \nThird-seeded Zimmerman (7-2) relies on the option offense. It means second-seeded Becker (8-0) must play very disciplined defensively, Lundeen said. \n\"It (the option) is a very good high school play,\" Lundeen said. \"Our kids have to do their assignments. \n\"It's easy to say and hard to do. It's hard to be disciplined sometimes (on defense).\" \nThe teams played Sept. 11, which was the fourth week of the season. \n\"I think we've gotten better since we met,\" Lundeen said. \nOther games \nThere are nine area football playoff games Tuesday night. A quick look: \n• In Section 6-2A, sixth-seeded Holdingford (5-4) plays at No. 2 Montevideo (8-1). Montevideo's lone loss is 26-21 to MInnewaska Area on Aug. 28. Holdingford opened the season with a 19-14 win over Minnewaska. \nThe Huskers surprised No. 3 Melrose 21-20 last Wednesday. \n• The other Section 6-2A semifinal has top-seeded Albany (7-1) host to No. 5 New London-Spicer (5-4). The Wildcats beat fourth-seeded Morris Area, 32-14. \nAlbany beat New London-Spicer 34-6 on Sept. 4. \nThe section final is 7 p.m. Saturday at St. Cloud State. \n• In Section 5-3A top-seeded Pierz (8-0) is host to fourth-seeded Foley (5-4), which is coming off a 27-14 win over Milaca. No. 3 Annandale (6-3) plays at No. 2 Mora (8-1). The semifinal winners play at 4 p.m. Saturday at St. Cloud State. \n• Section 5-2A has a couple of surprises in the semifinals. No. 6 Atwater-Cosmos-Grove City (4-5) plays at No. 2 Paynesville (6-3) and No. 5 Sauk Centre (4-5) is at No. 1 Minnewaska (7-1). \nThe winners play for the title at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Clemens Stadium in Collegeville.
