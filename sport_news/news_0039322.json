Seattle started the year with expectations of contenting in the AL West and reaching the postseason, but instead finished in fourth place in the division. \nDipoto was hired to replace Jack Zduriencik the final week of the regular season and said he would take his time evaluating whether McClendon would return. McClendon was under contract for the 2016 season. \nSEAHAWKS-LYNCH \nMarshawn Lynch to miss second straight game \nRENTON, Wash. (AP) - Marshawn Lynch will miss a second straight week for the Seattle Seahawks due to a hamstring strain. \nThe team on Friday officially ruled Lynch out for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals. \nLynch injured his hamstring in the second quarter of the team's 26-0 victory over the Chicago Bears in Week 3. Lynch returned to limited participation in practice on Thursday but is not ready to return. He will not travel with the team to Cincinnati. \nBackup Fred Jackson is listed as questionable after suffering a high-ankle sprain last week against Detroit. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll was optimistic that Jackson would be able to play. \nOREGON ST-ARIZONA \nSolomon expected back as Arizona, OSU seek 1st Pac-12 win \nTUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Oregon State will seek to give coach Gary Andersen his first Pac-12 win, facing an Arizona defense that has allowed a whopping 1,067 yards and 111 points in the last two games, blowout losses against UCLA and Stanford. \nThe Beavers (2-2, 0-1 Pac-12) had the week off after a 42-24 home loss to Stanford. In a scheduling quirk, the Wildcats (3-2, 0-2) don't have a bye, playing in 12 consecutive weeks. \nWASHINGTON ST-OREGON \nOregon has 3 options at quarterback vs Washington State \n(AP) -- The weekly quarterback mystery is becoming something of a theme for the Oregon Ducks this season. \nOregon wasn't saying which quarterback - or how many - it plans to play on Saturday afternoon when the Ducks (3-2, 1-1 Pac-12) host Washington State (2-2, 0-1). \nVernon Adams Jr., who was named the starter just prior to the beginning of the season but then broke the index finger on his throwing hand in the opener, sat out last weekend's 41-24 victory at Colorado. \nIn his place, the Ducks rotated Jeff Lockie, Adams' backup who was also Marcus Mariota's backup last season, and sophomore Taylor Alie, a former walk-on. Neither quarterback had a particularly spectacular outing against the Buffaloes, but the Ducks were able to effectively run the ball for the win. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
