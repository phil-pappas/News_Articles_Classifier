The Sooners had some ups and downs but came out of day two with four victories through two rounds of singles. \nHow the Sooners won and lost: Redshirt junior Mimi Fotopoulos lost a close match to Tulsa’s junior Rongrong Leenabanchong 6-2, 7-5. Sophomore Malene Stripp lost here first match in straight sets against SMU’s junior Mary Wright 6-1, 6-2, but won her second match in three sets against Kansas State’s junior Livia Cirnu 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. \nKey Sooner: The key player from today’s tournament was sophomore Christiana Brigante, who earned her first singles win over Tulsa’s junior Yelena Nemchen 1-6, 6-3, 6-2. \nKey Stat: Serving. Many OU players struggled to get their serves going, leading to missed first serves and double faults. Coach David Mullins downplayed the miscues afterward. \n“It was less on our serve and more on returns. We would play a really good point and gain some momentum and then give it straight back very quickly,” Mullins said. \nMore observations: One of the squad’s leaders, sophomore Lily Miyazaki, participated in a practice match Saturday but is not playing in this tournament. \n“She is playing in an All-American tournament next weekend. Everybody’s schedule is a little different and we felt competition wise for her we could up the ante at some other events,” Mullins said. \nStripp was also wearing an elbow brace for the second straight day, which limited her full potential to play her style of tennis. “Not really [brace affecting her] but she’s not able to serve at her full capacity and with her height that has taken a bay, and that’s one of her biggest strengths,” Mullins said. \nNext Up: Fotopoulos and Brigante will play in the semifinals of the Crimson doubles draw. They won win the first round 6-3, and won in the quarterfinals 6-2. They will face TCU’s redshirt junior Caroline Wegner and junior Seda Arantekin in the semifinals. \nStripp and sophomore Brooke Winthrow will play in the Red doubles draw semifinals. In the quarterfinals the duo defeated Wichita States’ sophomore Tanaporn Thongsing and senior Abby Stevens 6-0. \nThe team’s sophomore Simran Sethi and senior Emma Devine will face Texas Tech’s sophomores Gabriela Talaba and Sabrina Federici in the quarterfinal consolation bracket. \nThe tournament will continue on Sunday at 9 a.m. The semifinal round of doubles will begin, and then the championship round of doubles and singles will follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:41:34.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
