It turns out there should have been more time on the clock, and the official who failed to correct the timing mistake was suspended Wednesday.\nAdChoices According to Michael David Smith of Pro Football Talk, the league suspended side judge Rob Vernatchi for one week with pay following Monday’s sequence of events. According to the report, Vernatchi is expected to file a grievance.\nBell capped off the game-winning drive for the Steelers with a touchdown run in the final moments, but 18 seconds incorrectly ticked off before that possession began. After San Diego kicked off for a touchback following its field goal, the clock went down from 2:56 to 2:38 before Pittsburgh’s first snap.\nThe league recognized the error, and NFL Vice President of Football Communications Michael Signora offered a statement in the aftermath of the clock situation, per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport:\n. @NFL spokesman @NFLfootballinfo weighs in on last night's clock error in the MNF game pic.twitter.com/lokZfC0WwH\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 13, 2015 While the Steelers won the game, had Bell fallen short on the final play and the clock ran out, it would have resulted in a season-shifting controversy. Pittsburgh would have dropped to 2-3 on the season instead of 3-2, which would have left it a full three games behind the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC North.\nOn the flip side, the Chargers theoretically should have been provided an additional 18 seconds to respond to Bell’s touchdown, although Pittsburgh’s game management may have been different with the correct time on the clock.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://bleacherreport.com/", "https://twitter.com/NFL", "http://t.co/lokZfC0WwH", "https://twitter.com/NFLfootballinfo", "https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/653964844715085824", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/10/14/nfl-suspends-side-judge-over-clock-mistake/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:35:23.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
