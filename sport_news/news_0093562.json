(release) -- Newcomer Doug Reid scored his first pro hat trick, Dennis Sicard added a goal and the Knoxville Ice Bears defeated the Columbus Cottonmouths 4-2 in the teamâ€™s home opener. \nSicard scored 42 seconds into the game. Moments later a Columbus goal was disallowed when officials determined the puck had been kicked into the net by a Columbus skater. The Cottonmouths were 0-for-5 on the power play and never led in the game. \nReid scored his first goal at 16:57 of the second period to break a 1-1 tie when fellow rookie Zack LaRue found him from the left half board in front of the crease. His second came at 9:18 of the third when defenseman Bo Driscoll fed a pass from the left point into the slot. Reid completed the hat trick with an empty netter late in the third. \nLouie Belisle and Tyler Henry scored for Columbus. Knoxville goaltender Bryan Hince made 34 saves. The Ice Bears will travel to Fayetteville to take on the FireAntz on Friday. Columbus will host the Mississippi Riverkings for its home opener the same day. \nKnoxville began the evening by hoisting its fourth championship banner in franchise history after winning the SPHL Presidents Cup in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:51:08.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
