The Mean Green just didn't have enough firepower to compete in a 55-28 loss to Western Kentucky, one of the elite teams in Conference USA, on Thursday night at Apogee Stadium.\nBrandon Doughty threw for 350 yards and four touchdowns, and Anthony Wales added 193 rushing yards to pace the Hilltoppers. WKU (6-1) remained unbeaten in conference play at 4-0.\nThe Mean Green (0-6, 0-3) were left searching for their first win of the season after their second straight lopsided loss.\nUNT suffered an embarrassing 66-7 setback against Portland State on Saturday. McCarney was fired shortly after the game, leaving Canales and the Mean Green only four days to prepare for Thursday's contest.\n\"I am proud of our kids,\" Canales said. \"They showed some emotion. The score wasn't what we wanted, but we played a good football team. What I'm proud of is that they never stopped fighting.\"\nCanales was 2-3 in his first stint as the Mean Green's interim head coach, after Todd Dodge was fired in 2010.\nCanales made a few adjustments in his second time around, including starting junior quarterback DaMarcus Smith for the first time. Smith spent time at WKU earlier in his career before transferring to Butler County College in Kansas and then UNT.\nSmith gave UNT's offense a boost. The junior threw for 228 yards and four touchdowns while rushing for 122 yards. Smith pulled the ball down and made plays running several times and provided a complement to running back Jeffrey Wilson, who rushed for 91 yards.\n\"I'm my biggest critic and am not satisfied,\" Smith said. \"I understand that it is not about my personal stats or making plays or extending plays. At my position, it's about wins and losses. I have to continue to work and get better.\"\nUNT trailed 14-7 after wide receiver Tee Goree caught a 20-yard scoring pass from Smith in the second quarter.\nGarrett Schwettman kicked two field goals and Taywan Taylor caught a pair of long touchdown passes from Doughty in a 20-0 WKU surge. Taylor caught a 56-yard strike and later added a 31-yard touchdown catch that put the Hilltoppers up 34-7.\nUNT scored on the final play of the half when Smith threw a 46-yard strike across the field to Darvin Kidsy that pulled the Mean Green to within 34-14.\nThe Hilltoppers turned to their running game in the second half and worked on running out the clock. Wales scored on an 8-yard run, then added a 1-yard touchdown run that put the Hilltoppers up 48-14.\nUNT will play four of its next five games on the road.\n\"The emotions were strong,\" UNT wide receiver Carlos Harris said. \"Coach Canales came in energized and made sure that we were all upbeat and ready to compete. We didn't get the result that we wanted, but we will continue to build. He brought a lot of positive energy.\"\nTwitter: @brettvito\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-10-16T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:18:49.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
