Mandatory Credit: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports\nBreaking a Guinness World Record isn't easy. Just about anything you can think of, someone has already done it, and done it extremely well.\nAdChoices That didn't stop fans of the Dallas Mavericks, though.\nOver 700 Mavericks fans gathered together for an event held by the team to break the Guinness World Record for the largest game of \"Knockout\" in history.\nHere's more from Bobby Karalla at Mavs.com:\n\"More than 700 fans turned out — 701, to be exact, because that matters here — in an attempt to break the Guinness Book of World Records’ mark for largest game of basketball knockout. The title previously belonged to the Brooklyn Nets and their fans, but Dallas eclipsed the mark by 72 players.\n“It’s nice to see that the record stays in the NBA,” said Guinness representative Alex Angert, “and we look forward to seeing whether or not the Mavs can top their own record, or if another team comes in and tries to make this some sort of competition among basketball teams.”\nIt took 27 rounds and longer than three hours just to get to the final 10 participants, but from there the speed of the game picked up and, with that, so did the action. Anyone familiar with knockout knows how frenzied things become as the line gets shorter.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:28:56.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
