Even veteran Mets infielder David Wright was out at the time.\nThe Dodgers aren't the same team that got chased out of the NL Division Series by St. Louis a year ago, either. They shipped out Matt Kemp, Hanley Ramirez and Juan Uribe, and ushered in veterans Jimmy Rollins, Howie Kendrick and Yasmani Grandal.\nWhen Kershaw takes the mound for Friday night's opener at Dodger Stadium, he'll be trying to earn just the second postseason win of his career after going 0-4 in his last two series against the Cardinals.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
