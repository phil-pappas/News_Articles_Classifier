West Sabine looked to be driving again but a fumble would be recovered by the Bobcats Dylan Varnon. Hull-Daisetta then put together a nice drive which was a highlighted by a 45-yard run quarterback Brandon Maughan but a goal line stand would keep the Bobcats out of the end zone. The Tigers then responded a with a nice 95-yard drive with Demaria Smith scoring from the eight-yard line to make it 24-0 with 2:00 left in the half.
