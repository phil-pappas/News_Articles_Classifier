Just so you know, I'll occasionally be answering reader questions about everything from abandoned buildings to urban legends.\nLet's kick it off today by going to the mailbag. Caitlin D. of Tigard asks something that bridges my old beat as commuting reporter with my new gig:\n\"I wasn't born and raised in Oregon. But I have been driving on Southwest Taylors Ferry and Boones Ferry roads for about 10 years -- and I'm really confused by their names. What's the story behind all of the Ferry road names in the Portland area? What 'ferry'? I've asked my neighbors and co-workers about the history of the road names, but no one seems to know. Can you help?\"\nIf I ran the public school system, there would be three areas of mandatory study: A full year dedicated to dinosaurs (I'm appalled that the average fourth-grader can no longer distinguish between a Stegosaurus and Ankylosaurus ), the songwriting of Bono ( the pre-sunglasses years ) and the Portland region's early river commuters.\nAs crazy as it might seem, bridges haven't always spanned the Willamette Valley's waterways. Dating back to the mid-1800s, these heavily trafficked highways led travelers from the budding Rose City to ferries that, for a fee, carried people, livestock, wagons and cars across various rivers and lakes.\nThroughout its history, Oregon has been home to more than 500 private and public passenger-boat services, according to Charles F. Query's expansive \"A History of Oregon Ferries since 1826.\"\n\"Almost every pioneer community, especially those in the Willamette Valley, was tied to the rest of the territory by roads or trails crossing at least one waterway on a ferry, so ferries were essential facts of life,\" Query wrote in his 2008 book. \"As the population increased, improved roads with bridges could be justified, gradually rendering ferries obsolete.\"\nOnly a handful remain, including Clackamas County's Canby Ferry , which hauls cars and trucks across the Willamette for $4.\nWith the help of Geoff Wexler, library director of the Oregon Historical Society, I've pulled together a brief history of the three ferries that now only exist as road names in the Portland area.\nBoones Ferry: Maybe you've heard of this guy Daniel Boone , one of the country's most famous fur-pelt-wearing frontiersmen. His grandson, Alphonso Boone, trekked to Oregon via the Applegate wilderness trail in 1846. A year later, Alphonso's enterprising son, Jesse, began operating a ferry across the Willamette, just west of the current site of the Interstate 5 Boone Bridge at Wilsonville.\nAlphonso died three years later in northern California, searching for gold, claimed by what the history books describe only as \"miner's disease.\" The ferry operation was eventually sold. The Oregon highway commission took control of the conveyance at the turn of the century – when a trip for a horse and buggy cost 25 cents -- and decommissioned it in 1954.\nThe Oregon Journal reported that \"fewer than 100 people gathered at 5 p.m.\" for the final trip of the Jesse V. Boone Ferry across the river. \"Among them were a few misty eyes and thousand memories,\" the newspaper reported.\nThe Oregon Journal/1954 The ferry crossing site is still visible from the southbound lanes of the Boone Bridge.\nScholls Ferry: In 1847, settler Peter Scholl, also from Kentucky and of the Daniel Boone bloodline, took up a donation claim at the end of the Oregon Trail and started what became one of the Tualatin River's most vital crossings. Scholl died in Portland in 1872. A bridge eventually replaced the ferry.\nTaylors Ferry: New Yorker John A. Taylor crossed the plains with an ox team in 1852 and promptly built a ferry crossing on the Tualatin River, about 10 miles from Portland. He was more industrious than Boone and Scholl. He eventually built a toll bridge on his own to replace the ferry. At one time, Taylor was also the judge of Washington County and postmaster of the Taylors Ferry poster office.\nThere you go. Impress your neighbors and co-workers with your sudden (and astounding) knowledge of the ferry roads. Maybe next time we'll talk about the dinosaurs of Washington County, starting with the Wooly Mammoths that once followed the ice age trail that is now Tualatin's Southwest Nyberg Street.\n— Joseph Rose\n503-221-8029\njrose@oregonian.com\n@josephjrose", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/josephjrose", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosaurus", "https://books.google.com/books?id=2WGogUfncYEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false", "http://www.clackamas.us/roads/ferry.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:55:46.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
