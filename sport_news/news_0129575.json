It’s something he’ll never forget. \nIn his fifth home game wearing Virginia Tech’s colors, Ford was witness last season to a merciless vocal symphony from a disgruntled fan base during Tech’s 30-6 loss to Miami. Embarrassed and stunned, Ford learned from the experience. \n“It was awful,” said Ford, a sophomore wide receiver who leads Tech with 28 catches for 421 yards and paces the Atlantic Coast Conference with six touchdown catches. “That was the first time I ever got booed at a home game in my whole career, so that isn’t a feeling that I ever want to feel again.” \nHe’s not the only Tech player or coach to come away from last season’s Thursday night disaster in Lane Stadium against the Hurricanes with his pride hurt. \nComing off its most impressive win of the season last Friday in a 28-13 victory against North Carolina State, Tech (3-3, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) is back in the thick of the Coastal Division race, but a Saturday trip to play Miami and its potent passing attack is on the horizon. \nThe 2015 Virginia Tech football season in photos. \nIt remains to be seen which quarterback will command Tech’s offense — Michael Brewer or Brenden Motley. Brewer still is recovering from a broken collarbone he sustained Sept. 7 in Tech’s season-opening loss to No. 1 Ohio State. \nTech associate head coach and running backs coach Shane Beamer said Monday that Brewer hadn’t been medically cleared to play in games as of Sunday’s team meetings, but he was slated to be re-evaluated by team doctors Monday afternoon and Tuesday. Brewer returned to full practice participation last week, but wasn’t cleared for Friday’s game against N.C. State.

Miami is 12th in the ACC this season in rushing offense (143.8 yards per game), but Kaaya’s throwing is now the focal point of the offense. \nGone to the NFL is running back Duke Johnson, who ran for 249 yards last season at Tech — the most ever by an opposing running back in Lane Stadium. Gus Edwards, who gained 115 rushing yards last season at Tech, is out for the season with a foot injury. \n“I mean, they were busting runs for 8 yards a pop,” said Tech defensive tackle Luther Maddy, who watched last season’s game from the sideline with a knee injury. “Terrible job up front on defense … so I think we still have a chip on our shoulder just being embarrassed from last year.” \nThis season, Kaaya is leading the top passing offense in the ACC (309.8 yards per game) and 18th-best in the nation out of 127 Football Bowl Subdivision programs. \nHe’s completed 60.8 percent of his passes for 1,499 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception, and leads the ACC in total offense (292.4 yards per game). Against FSU, he completed 29 of 49 passes for 405 yards and three touchdowns. \n“He can throw it,” Frank Beamer said. “You can tell he’s very much in charge, too, and he’s got some explosive receivers.” \nA trio of Miami receivers — Rashawn Scott (29 catches for 415 yards and two touchdowns), Herb Waters (19 catches for 299 yards) and Stacy Coley (the ACC’s Receiver of the Week after catching seven passes for 139 yards and a touchdown at FSU) — present a tough matchup for Tech’s young secondary, which has worked through growing pains to spearhead the nation’s 11th-best passing defense (150.5 yards per game). \nWhile Tech waits to see which quarterback will direct its passing game, it appears to have found the No. 1 option it has been seeking in the backfield. Travon McMillian, who had 11 carries for 96 yards and a touchdown against N.C. State, again will be Tech’s starting tailback at Miami, which is 12th in the ACC in total defense (383 yards per game). \n“Our backs were to the wall, and our coaches and players, I thought, did a tremendous job,” Frank Beamer said of his team’s win against N.C. State. “Sometimes coaches get lost in that, but I tell them that’s when they coach their best … that’s when coaching makes a difference. “Anyone can coach when things are silky smooth and going well, but that’s when you find out who the good coaches are — when it’s a little rough and people are doubting you and not many good things are being said about you.” \nWood can be reached by phone at 757-247-4642.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:25:19.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
