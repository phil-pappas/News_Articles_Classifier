There are three people mentioned to buy. So it's a case of whether CVC or Mr. Mackenzie wants to sell.\" \nEcclestone earlier this year raised the prospect of buying back F1 himself. \n\"We'll see,\" Ecclestone said when asked if he was one of the three interested parties. \nThe AP reported in June that F1 is a takeover target for Qatar Sports Investments, which has French soccer club Paris Saint-Germain in its investment portfolio and linked up with Miami Dolphins owner RSE Ventures to consider a bid. \n\"There has been a lot of interest,\" Ecclestone said earlier Tuesday at the Camp Beckenbauer Global Summit in Austria. \"I am surprised if one of them don't buy very shortly.\" \nEcclestone told the AP he is \"very happy with the shareholders at the moment\" and has no plans to retire. \n\"The people that I've spoken to, the people who are interested in buying the shares, have asked me if I would stay,\" Ecclestone said, adding that his answer was \"Yes.\" \nEcclestone has a 5.3 percent stake in F1, while CVC owns 35.5 percent after initially gaining control of the sport in 2006 for around $2 billion. \nRob Harris can be followed at http://www.twitter.com/RobHarris and http://www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:30:42.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
