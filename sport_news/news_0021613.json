Shaun Stackhouse is a first-year starter at quarterback. \nThe charge up front has been led by center Joe Carter, guards John Anderson and Andrew Short, tackles Zach Blickley and Keith Rieser, and tight ends Rick Johnston and Shawn Mackin . All but Short and Mackin are returning starters. \nA 3-4 defense that has yielded an average of 15.6 points per game has been spearheaded by ends Stock and Sean Hartman, linebacker Ryan Magrann , and safeties Hickey and Joe Lauch . Stock and Lauch converted from linebacker and cornerback, respectively. \nOf Lauch, Bedesem said, \"He might be 140 pounds soaking wet, but he hits like a 200-pounder.\" \nC.R. South is 4-0 in conference action going into Friday night's home showdown against co-leader and defending champ Quakertown (7-0, 4-0). The Golden Hawks fell to the Panthers, 19-7, last season. \n\"We're really looking forward to it,\" Patterson, 17, said. \"It's our senior night, and we're tied for first place with them. We have plenty of motivation.\" \nPatterson, of Richboro, earned first-team all-conference honors as a midfielder in lacrosse last season. His younger brother, Chase, is a two-way back on the Golden Hawks' freshman football squad. \nExtra points. In Saturday's 49-24 loss to Catholic League Class AAAA rival St. Joseph's Prep, La Salle sophomore Isaiah Jones carried 14 times for 95 yards. He was involved in eight first-half tackles (five solos) at free safety and made a third-quarter interception. Fellow Explorers defensive back Charles Headen returned a second-quarter pick 41 yards to the Prep 29-yard line. . . . St. Joe's Prep strong safety Zach Goss made a fumble recovery and interception in the opening 6 minutes. Hawks teammate D'Andre Swift carried 22 times for 158 yards and two fourth-quarter scores. For the season, the junior tailback has netted 821 yards and nine TDs on 126 attempts. . . . According to former Roman Catholic coach Bob Wagner, the Cahillites have an all-time record of 499-566-68. Wagner graduated from Roman in 1963 and guided his alma mater from 1977 to 1984. . . . Coatesville coach Matt Ortega said Red Raiders QB and strong safety Jordan Young missed most of the second half of last Friday's 22-12 loss to Downingtown East because of cramping in both legs. He expects Young to return Friday vs. Avon Grove.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:49:19.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
