Paul Skrbina Contact Reporter \nNotre Dame can exhale and head into its open date on a 6-1 roll after a 41-31, hold-your-breath victory against USC on Saturday night. The No. 11 Irish will play four of their final five games on the road, beginning Oct. 31 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia against No. 22 Temple. \nOffense \nA. DeShone Kizer (227 yards, 2 TDs passing) keeps improving, though having Will Fuller (3 catches, 131 yards, 1 TD) and C.J. Prosise (19 carries, 143 yards, 2 TDs) around doesn't hurt. The Irish scored 21 points in a quarter against USC for the first time in 87 games against it. \nDefense \nC-. The secondary bent to the tune of 440 passing yards but broke USC's heart with two fourth-quarter interceptions â€“ one each by KeiVarae Russell and Max Redfield. Jaylon Smith had 14 tackles for the Irish, while Russell added 10. (CQ) \nSpecial teams \nA. Equanimeous St. Brown blocked a punt that Amir Carlisle turned into a touchdown, Justin Yoon hit two field goals and Kizer twice punted and pinned the Trojans inside their own 20. (CQ) \nCoaching \nB. After being burned on trick plays three times this season, Notre Dame pulled out one of its own when receiver Torii Hunter Jr. completed his first pass, a 35-yarder to Alize Jones. The Irish also recovered in the second half, allowing 222 yards after surrendering 368 in the first half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:05:42.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
