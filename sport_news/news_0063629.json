According to an incident report, Conyers police were called to the scene after an SUV hit his Rascal 300 scooter.\nResponding officers found a disheveled Mitchell “backing into the building and over plants” in his wheelchair.\nMitchell told an officer he had taken the anti-anxiety medication Valium, the anti-depressant trazadone and “consumed a pint of alcohol.”\nMitchell submitted to a breath test, the results of which were redacted from the incident report. He was cited and taken to the hospital.\n“Mitchell’s electric wheelchair was secured at Conyers Police Department for safe keeping,” the incident report said.\nOn Tuesday, Mitchell told Channel 2 Action News he can barely walk and was at the grocery store Friday to get a prescription filled.\n“I was out of medication,” he said. “So I had me a drink.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:58:25.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
