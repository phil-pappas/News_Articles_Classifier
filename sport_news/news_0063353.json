The Jets’ lone loss, against the Eagles at home, came with Ivory on the sidelines, nursing a groin injury. In four starts, he has run for 460 yards, four touchdowns and 5.5 yards per carry. On Sunday, he showed he can be a factor in the passing games, hauling in three catches for 50 yards. \nFor the first time in his four seasons in New Jersey, Ivory is the unquestioned featured back, receiving 20 or more carries three times this season. The most carries he has had in a single season was 198 last year, but he’s on pace to shatter that mark with 83 already. \nOffensive guard Willie Colon said he believes Ivory’s big start is more the result of new offensive coordinator Chan Gailey’s system fitting Ivory. The Jets are using all his attributes — speed, power and patience. He was previously pigeonholed as a power back, but Ivory has shown he has the quickness to match. \n“Chris has an ability, he can outrun a lot of guys,” Colon said. “A lot of safeties and corners don’t want to tackle him one-on-one. When they see him coming, they start back-pedaling a little bit. That’s on us to get him going. When we’re able to do that, it puts pressure on the defense.” \nIvory wouldn’t say this is the best he has played since entering the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 2010. But he never has been this patient, which he credits to running backs coach Marcel Shipp. There is no secret. Shipp is always in his ear, telling him to wait until the last possible moment for the hole to open up. \n“Once you see it,” Shipp tells Ivory, “hit it.” \n“I have a lot of patience, and I’m able to allow things to develop,” Ivory said. \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brandon marshall ,  chris ivory ,  new york jets ,  willie colon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:14:52.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
