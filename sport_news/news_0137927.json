The Bills were just 3 of 16 on third-down conversions. Buffalo held Giants star WR Odell Beckham Jr. to five catches for 38 yards. CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThree ... \n1. Will the Bills have an answer on defense for Odell Beckham Jr.? What would you have said if I had told you before the game Beckham would have five catches for 38 harmless yards? You would have said the Bills are winning that game. And of course, you'd be wrong. Beckham was as quiet as he could possibly be given his otherworldly talent. Oh, he made one incredible catch, but it was two yards out of bounds. The Bills did an excellent job on him, and it wasn't always Stephon Gilmore, sometimes it was rookie Ronald Darby who held his own because the Bills CBs didn't switch sides of the field. Unfortunately, the Bills didn't do such a good job on Dwayne Harris, Rueben Randle, and Rashad Jennings who all caught touchdown passes from Eli Manning. \nBills report card: Grade the team \n2. How will the Bills overcome the absences of LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins? They didn't, plain and simple. In theory, it was easy to look at the Bills depth and say that Robert Woods could step in for Watkins, and Chris Hogan would step up to No. 3 and all would be well. And the way Karlos Williams had been running the first three weeks, sure, plug him in and the Bills wouldn't miss a beat. What wasn't properly accounted for was how much less the Giants had to prepare for, and worry about, with McCoy and Watkins in street clothes. Minus those two big threats, the Giants could devote more resources to Buffalo's lesser replacements, and the results were ugly. Percy Harvin, Woods, and Hogan combined for 11 catches for just 102 yards. And Williams never got going, finishing with just 40 yards rushing, though he did catch a 23-yard TD pass. McCoy and Watkins can't get back fast enough, but the problem is, it looks as if they won't be back in the near future as both could be out another 2-3 weeks.

I caught some flak from some on Twitter - where flak is a rite of passage - for calling Eli Manning an elite-level quarterback. Well, the guy only has two Super Bowl rings, 40,731 career passing yards, and 266 touchdowns. I don't know much, but it seems to me Bills fans would take that, right? In every year of his career since he became the Giants' full-time starter in 2005, he has thrown for more yards than whoever the Bills' quarterback was in that year. Sunday, he wasn't great, but he was more than good enough. He threw for 212 yards and three touchdowns, and when the Giants absolutely needed to put together a drive in the fourth quarter, he engineered it. Taylor has a long, long way to go. Like his team, he has been a rollercoaster, up one week, down the next. He finished with more passing yards than Manning, and he lost two touchdowns due to penalties, but Manning won the game.

(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) Ryan says Bills had fight but what good did it do? \nâ€¦ and Out \nIf this is who the Bills are going to be, then they aren't going to the playoffs. You can't be Jekyll one week and Hyde the next week and expect to contend for a berth, even with a roster that we like to think is improved. To date, we have seen the Bills play some great offense and defense, some pathetic offense and defense, and on special teams it has mostly been bad. We've also seen them commit an absurd amount of penalties, and they aren't just technique things, they're lame-brain stupid things that good teams don't do, Jerry Hughes leading the way with his four personal foul penalties in four games, followed closely by Preston Brown and his three. What's to come next week in Tennessee, the third opponent in the first five games who will get to play the Bills on extra rest? New England and the Giants had 10 days to get ready for the Bills, and came into Buffalo and won. The Titans had their bye, so they have a full two weeks, and the Bills have to go to Nashville. Tennessee isn't a playoff team by any stretch, and it has a rookie quarterback, but if the Bills play like they did Sunday, start chewing on a 2-3 start, with the talented Bengals coming to Buffalo next. Charles Clay had it...&#10;So how did Devon Kennard intercept this ball? &#10;Seriously, how? #NYGvsBUF http://t.co/KZ7kRwnTfQ \nNumbers â€¦ \n19 - Buffalo's third-down conversion percentage (3-for-16) \n210 - The combined penalty yardage between the teams, including a whopping, laughable 135 by the Bills on 17 infractions, the most ever by the Bills in a home game. 9 - Catches by Charles Clay, just the sixth time in Bills history a tight end has had at least that many in a game, and the first such game since Pete Metzelaars in 1993. \nTalking points â€¦ \nGiants coach Tom Coughlin on being 2-2: \"It shows grit. We are the team I thought us to be. To be honest with you, we didn't practice as well as we wanted to early in the week, but by the end of the week we did, and I told them that before the game started. They've done a great job, they're battlers.\" \nGiants QB Eli Manning: \"We were challenged after the first two games where we had leads going into the fourth quarter and lost them. So (Coughlin) challenged us and said, 'Hey, we gotta elevate our level of play in the fourth quarter' and I think we have done that in these past two weeks.\" \nGiants WR Odell Beckham Jr.: \"Everybody is giving great effort in every direction we needed. It was great to be able to pick up a win today down here in Buffalo against what's going to come out to be a really good team at the end of the year.\" \nInjury report ... \n-- SS Bacarri Rambo left the game in the fourth quarter with a quad injury. \n-- TE MarQueis Gray left with an arm injury in the third quarter and did not return. \n-- RB LeSean McCoy was inactive due to a hamstring injury. \n-- WR Sammy Watkins was inactive due to a calf injury. \n-- RG John Miller sat out with a groin injury. \n-- SS Aaron Williams was inactive for the second game in a row due to a neck injury.
