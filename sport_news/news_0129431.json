She sealed the victory after two hours and 13 minutes.\nThe first momentum swing came midway through the first set - after Muguruza powered to an early 4-2 lead, Radwanska reeled off four games in a row to sneak out the 41-minute opening set 6-4.\nThen, the big swing - Muguruza reeled off 11 of the next 15 games to not only take the second set 6-3, but built a 5-1 lead in the third.\nThe No.4-seeded Radwanska began closing in, winning the next three games to make it 5-4. She even had a point for 5-all but it was just too little, too late.\nMuguruza had bigger and tidier numbers for the match. She finished with a -1 differential of winners to unforced errors (43 to 44) while Radwanska finished with a -3 differential (24 to 27).\n\"I know Aga is an amazing player, so I knew I had to be concentrated and focused all the time against her, and try to be more ready in the important moments which was my goal,\" Muguruza commented after the match.\n\"I'm extremely happy to be in the final. I'm really going to try and get the trophy.\"\nMuguruza will now move to a career-high of No.4 on the women's singles rankings on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:41:31.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
