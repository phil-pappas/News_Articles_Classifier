Sports clothing and footwear can be defined as any piece of apparel or footwear that is designed to be worn by participants during sports and fitness activities or to be worn as casual leisurewear. With a vast range of sports and fitness trends sweeping the UK, from traditional sports such as football and swimming to new, emerging fitness crazes such as indoor classes of Tabata and Bokwa, the sportswear market consists of a broad and diverse range of clothing and footwear items. New fitness activities and new product innovation and designs are seeing new products constantly enter the market, thereby making it difficult to give an overview of the exact products that this market covers.\nThe fashion industry has been increasingly focused on sportswear in recent years, yet sportswear that is manufactured and retailed by high-end designers and high-street retailers and which carries their branding is not included in the scope of this report, as these products are generally designed solely for fashion and not functional purposes. These fashion brands offer sportswear when sports designs are in vogue with the latest trends; therefore, sportswear is not a product constantly supplied by these companies, which means that they are not regarded as direct competitors in the sportswear market and are thus excluded from the size of the market by value. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this report, some fashion brands are discussed as they encroach on the sales figures of the main sportswear competitors - having launched their own activewear lines for specific participation in sports and fitness, running alongside their main fashionwear ranges - and are thus having an impact on the market as external, emerging competitors.\nMarket Sectors\nSports Clothing v Sports Footwear Sportswear for Fashion v Sportswear for Function or Performance Key Topics Covered:\n1.
