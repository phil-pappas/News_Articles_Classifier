Rutgers coach Kyle Flood officially reinstated Carroo on Wednesday, one day after the assault charge against the Edison native was dismissed. \n\"I would like to thank Coach Flood, my family and friends for my opportunity to be back on the team,\" Carroo said. \"I'm relieved that the case is behind me and it's dismissed. I'm just happy to be back out here with my teammates and ready to go.\" \nAfter participating in practice, Carroo changed into a red Rutgers polo shirt. He then stood in front of a crowd of reporters and cameras, answering questions for nearly six minutes. Rutgers Leonte Carroo speaks after return to team Rutgers WR Leonte Carroo addresses the media following his first practice with the Scarlet Knights after domestic violence charges were dropped against him. He declined to go into any specifics about what he repeatedly referred to as an 'unfortunate event.' \nThe typically outspoken Carroo was more subdued than usual. He declined to go into details about the Sept. 12 altercation, which involved his girlfriend, his mother, a woman he had a romantic relationship with and others. \nThe woman, who worked as a Rutgers recruiting ambassador, accused Carroo of slamming her to the ground . The case was dismissed on Wednesday when the woman said she didn't want to testify. \n\"This was a very serious matter and I don't take any of this for granted,\" Carroo said. \"I'm just blessed to be back out here. After speaking with my family and friends and teammates, I understand this is a blessing and I am very lucky and fortunate. But like I said, this was a very unfortunate event.\" \nRutgers announced that Carroo was reinstated after agreeing \"to the conditions of his reinstatement.\" Carroo declined to share those conditions. \n\"I don't really want to get into that,\" Carroo said. \"Coach Flood knows the conditions. My athletic director knows the conditions. I'm going to take those conditions seriously to make sure they are well in effect. I'm going to use it as an opportunity to get better from them.\" \nRELATED : Can Leonte Carroo's return turn around this Rutgers season? | Politi Bits \nAlthough he missed two games, Carroo said he never had any doubt that he would be reinstated. \n\"The type of character I have and me knowing this event and how unfortunate it was, I just knew I had to be patient and just wait,\" Carroo said. \"But Coach Flood is a great guy. I knew one day I would be back on this team. I just knew, like I said, I had to stay patient and unfortunately the legal process is slow. I'm just happy to be back out here.\" \nCarroo tested the NFL Draft waters after catching 55 passes for 1,086 yards and 10 touchdowns last season. He said he's hopeful NFL scouts and coaches will \"know what type of character I have.\" \n\"The people that know me and were there from Day 1 know what happened,\" Carroo said. \"Everybody who has judged me on my character doesn't really know the story. But my coaches and my teammates and my family know what happened. That's what's important.\" \nCarroo is eligible to play in Saturday's game against Michigan State (8 p.m., BTN). He was barred from the team's facility during his suspension, but he stayed in shape by working out with his friends. \nIt's unclear how big of a role Carroo will have on Saturday after just two days of practice. But he said he was happy just being back on the field with his teammates. \n\"It hurt,\" Carroo said. \"This is the game that I love that I've been playing since I was a little kid. Me just not being here with my teammates is what hurt me the most.\" \nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21 .
