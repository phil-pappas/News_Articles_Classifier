(G.G. Rigsby/Effingham Now). By G.G. Rigsby Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said public education drives the economy at the groundbreaking for a $7 million STEM Academy that will more than double the size of the Effingham College and Career Academy.\nConstruction should begin in late November or early December on the 47,000-square-foot Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics addition, which will be completed by August 2016.\nPope Construction of Statesboro is the construction manager for the project, which includes 21 classrooms. Superintendent Randy Shearouse said 600 students attend classes at ECCA, which currently has 44,000 square feet. The STEM Academy will serve 500 more students.\nAt the groundbreaking Friday, Cagle said children learn in different ways and a one-size-fits-all approach to public education won't build a strong economy.\nCagle cited the example of an African-American girl who attended a career academy in Georgia and learned that she wanted to work in criminal justice. She graduated from high school with an associate’s degree in criminal justice, which didn’t cost her anything for tuition.\nCagle said the goal is to have every student ready for college or a career when they leave high school.\n“She’s not like my three boys,” Cable said. “She didn’t go and get a liberal arts degree and then look back and try to determine what she’s going to do in life.\n“Imagine what a society we would have if more kids were on these kinds of path to where they were focused and motivated and had meaning and purpose in what they were doing,” he said. “Kids now would find this prosperity that we talk about where the American dream was real.”\nShearouse said the addition will mean more students will be able to take advantage of the facility and its Career, Technical and Agricultural Education programs and its affiliation with Savannah Tech next door.\n“They not only have the book knowledge, they also have the hands-on experiences that will take them very far in life,” he said.\nMartin Wilkins, manager of business systems at Edwards Interiors Aerospace, said education and industry working together is key.\nWilkins, who serves on the board of directors for ECCA, said local industry benefits from students who study engineering and technology, distribution and logistics, graphic design, welding and, in the new STEM Academy, aircraft assembly and technology.\n“These are real-world careers based on real-world demand from employers in real-world industry,” said John Henry, CEO of the Effingham County Industrial Development Authority.\nThe STEM Academy will be paid for with money from the penny-per-dollar sales tax. Voters will be asked on Nov. 3 whether to approve another five years of Education Special-Purpose Local-Option Sales Tax.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14803800.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14803802.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14803805.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14803802.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14803798.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14803798.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14803805.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14803794.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14803794.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14803792.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14803800.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14803792.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:07:36.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
