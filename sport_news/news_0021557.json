(Plus the stepping-on-them-in-the-middle-of-the-night thing.)\nIt has long been rumored that the Danish brick-makers refused to manufacture toy weapons throughout most of Lego's existence but changed that policy when they teamed up with licensed characters (Star Wars, Batman).\nNow, of course, Lego sets arrive with rifles, swords, nunchucks and so many other instruments of death that there are entire websites devoted solely to purchasing Lego mini-figure weaponry. (I'm not linking to them. You can Google it if that's your thing.)\nAll of which brings me to Lux Blox .\nCreated by a Galesburg, Ill., couple and manufactured primarily in the Midwest, the blocks are just beginning to trickle into toy stores. They operate with a snap-and-lock hinge, so they curve and bend, which means kids (or adults) can build them into any shape they want. (An 88-piece set starts at around $29; 200-piece set, $69; and 450-piece, $129. The sets currently are sold only at bricks-and-mortar retailers — some accept and ship orders by phone — and the company website includes a store locator.)\nBest of all? They come with no instructions.\n\"We think users do better without them,\" inventor Mike Acerra, a portrait artist and former teacher, told me. \"Most of the time kids figure out things we didn't even imagine, and they don't need to have a Star Wars box set to do that.\"\nOr guns, obviously.\nAcerra and his wife, Heather, designed the toy to mimic the principles of nature, inspired in part by Mike Acerra's time living in the wilderness in Maine, post-college, where he immersed himself in the study of science, nature and art. He wanted to create a toy that would let kids build atoms, molecules and cell structures, as well as dinosaurs, skyscrapers and vehicles.\nLux Blox Mike Acerra / Lux Blox “When you play with them, you’re getting an understanding of space and structure,” said Heather Acerra, who owns the company with her husband, Mike.\n“When you play with them, you’re getting an understanding of space and structure,” said Heather Acerra, who owns the company with her husband, Mike.\n(Mike Acerra / Lux Blox) The couple looked to architect Frank Lloyd Wright, inventor Buckminster Fuller and Friedrich Froebel, an early 19th century German educator and the inventor of kindergarten.\n\"Froebel thought if children were given the right tools and shown how nature works, they could actually surpass adults in their knowledge,\" Mike Acerra said. \"He refused to consider kids as vessels to be filled up with scholastic knowledge, and I've always been enamored of that idea. We decided to make a block for the 21st century using what we know now that we didn't know then.\"\nWhich means they could use a 3-D printer to help them design the blocks, and incorporate robotics principles along with those of nature.\n\"When you play with them, you're getting an understanding of space and structure,\" Heather Acerra said. \"That's important because one of the things we're falling behind in is spatial literacy. When you step into a two-dimensional world — looking at a screen — you're not using the part of your brain that uses three-dimensional principles.\"\nHeather Acerra said occupational therapists and parents of children on the autism spectrum have had success with Lux Blox where other toys have failed to capture or retain interest.\nAnd, Mike added, they're just fun.\n\"A lot of people really geek out on them, across the board,\" he said. \"They're all these little cell blocks that when they're all put together have the qualities of squishiness, so the mind goes outside any realm of experience.\"\nI wonder how it feels when you step on them.\nhstevens@tribpub.com\nTwitter @heidistevens13\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e5c55/turbine/ct-lux-blox-better-than-lego-balancing-act-heidi-stevens-20151026", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e58b0/turbine/ct-balancing-03-jpg-20151026", "https://www.quora.com/When-did-LEGO-set-start-containing-contemporary-weapons"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:13:58.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
