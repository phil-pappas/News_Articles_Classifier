(AP Photo/Massimo Pinca) more > By DANIELLA MATAR - Associated Press   \nTURIN, Italy (AP) - Juventus eased to a 2-0 win over Sevilla to move top of Group D in the Champions League on Wednesday as the Turin side once again put its domestic woes to one side. \nAlvaro Morata broke the deadlock four minutes from halftime, scoring for the fifth successive Champions League match, and substitute Simone Zaza secured the win three minutes from time in his first ever European match. \nJuventus, which beat Manchester City in its opening group match, is three points above both Sevilla and City, which won 2-1 at Borussia Monchengladbach. \nJuventus and Sevilla have had woeful starts to their respective domestic seasons and both have just five points after six rounds. \n“The difference? In the Champions League we have six points and in the league we have five, having played more games,” Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. “We had a good game tonight, and that didn’t happen at Napoli. And in football if you don’t play well, you can run as much as you want but little changes. \n“Our attitude has always been the same … we played better technically tonight.” \nSevilla, which kicked off its Champions League campaign with a 3-0 win over ‘Gladbach, only recorded its first win in the Spanish league last weekend. \n“We did OK in attack and we noticed improvement in the rest but not enough against a great side like Juventus,” Sevilla coach Unai Emery said. “We had hardly any goalscoring chances. The result is fair and now we have to go forward like this and things will improve as we grow as a team.” \nLosing finalists last season, Juventus almost got off to the perfect start as it had a great chance inside the opening 30 seconds, but Paul Pogba volleyed over the crossbar from inside the area. \nSevilla was defending in numbers and every time Juventus attacked it found itself faced with a sea of red shirts. However, Patrice Evra was finding space on the left flank and he nearly set up the opener in the eighth minute. \nThe former Manchester United defender had time to stop and look up before sending in a pinpoint cross, which Morata headed just wide of the right post under pressure. \nJuventus was also trying its luck from distance and a Hernanes snapshot flew narrowly wide of the the left upright from 30 yards. \nPaulo Dybala went even closer in the 17th minute when he curled an effort millimeters wide of the far left post from the edge of the area. \nSevilla was content to sit back and counterattack but posed little threat to the Juventus defense. \nJuventus should have taken the lead in the 35th following a great cut-back from the byline by Sami Khedira to Dybala but the Argentinian slipped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:28:00.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
