The major league soccer star will be signing autographs and taking photos with fans. Scheduled to occur as well is a signed t-shirt giveaway in which anyone who makes an Eyes on You purchase will receive a free signed t-shirt by Osvaldo Alonso. Guests are welcome but must RSVP as space is limited. Autographs are given on a first-come first-serve basis.\nDr. Evie Lawson, the proprietor of Eyes on You, has been a Sounders fan for as long as she can remember. Having attended matches for years, she is honored and delighted to have Osvaldo Alonso as her guest and is excited to share this experience with the community. Having received her degree from the New England School of Optometry, she is an esteemed expert in her field and admired by peers. Dr. Lawson currently resides in Seattle proper with her husband and two children.\nMr. Alonso was born on November 11, 1985, in San Crist√≥bal, Cuba where his affinity for soccer began. He began his professional career in 2007 with the Pinar del Rio, a Cuban soccer team. Soon after, Alonso defected to the United States where he would eventually opt to sign with Charleston Battery with the hopes of having more playing time. He later, in 2008, received the MVP award and Newcomer of the Year award. After his short time with the Charleston Battery, he was signed by Seattle Sounders FC where he became a regular starter at defensive midfield. He has been with the Sounders ever since.\nThe event will only last two hours so it is imperative to be there on time, especially if you are anticipating receiving an autograph. For more information, please contact Eyes on You directly at (206) 467.1006 or visit http://www.eyesonyouseattle.com/ .\nAbout Eyes on You and Dr. Evie Lawson:\nEyes on You was founded in 2015 by Dr. Evie Lawson, head optometrist at the 1121 1st Avenue location located in the heart of downtown Seattle.
