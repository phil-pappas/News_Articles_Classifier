We troll for lakers from 185 to 245 feet deep. Fish within 3 to 5 feet of the bottom and keep your speed around 1.3 mph.\nGlow in the dark Smile Blades from Mack’s Lure continue to be the go to attractor here on Lake Chelan. Put those in front of a 4 inch needlefish squid rig by Silver Horde, bait them with a piece of Northern Pikeminnow and scent everything with Pautzke’s Krill Juice to keep yourself consistently into the fish.\nMost Read Stories 12 reasons why living in Washington is better than living in Oregon Seattle man charged with killing stranger after minor argument Crowd prays with coach as he defies school district Shrugging at squatters is the new normal for Seattle Basketball players becoming quite commonplace in the NFL Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. WDFW will soon make it’s annual fall triploid Rainbow trout plant on Lake Chelan. They can be caught by a variety of methods.\nCatch them from shoreline locations with Pautzke’s Firebait in American Wildfire using a 30” leader on a slip sinker rig. You can also catch them trolling using Mack’s Lure Mini Cha Cha Squidders behind a Mack’s Lure 0000 Double D Dodger. Bait those mini cha cha’s with a piece of worm or a small nugget of Pautzke’s Fire Bait.\nYour fishing tip of the week is to make a plan and WORK the plan. Making those changes when your first presentation or location doesn’t work is the hardest thing to do. You know, “it worked yesterday”… Maybe something changed. On Chelan, somewhere between 45 minutes and 1 hour and 15 minutes without a bite is my limit. Then you have to change something. Don’t cross over that line from being appropriately persistent to just stubborn.\nThe kid’s tip of the week is to get them to those shoreline locations on Lake Chelan for those planter rainbows between school and dinner. You’ll make memories. Your safety tip of the week is to take a minute and check your hose from the gasoline fill to your fuel tank. Over time it can develop cracks and allow gasoline to pour into your bilge. Not good… Enjoy the fall wildlife viewing opportunities in the valley this time of the year.\nFor more information go to Darrell & Dad’s Family Guide Service website at www.darrellanddads.com or 866-360-1523.\n \n \n \nMark Yuasa : 206-464-8780 or myuasa@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @markkyuasa .
