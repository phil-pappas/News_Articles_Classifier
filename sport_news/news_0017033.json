He won it again in 2011, clocking a near identical 17:54.32. Last year, he was among the rest of the world class competition left in the wake of ex-Harvard rower Andrew Campbell, who dipped under Kjetil Borch’s course mark of 17:12.13, set the previous year, with a sizzling time of 17:11.64 over the twisting three-mile trek from near Boston University’s DeWolfe Boathouse to Artesani Park in Brighton.\n“I guess Andrew Campbell is the guy that we’ll all be chasing,” said Drysdale, whose name Mahe comes from the largest island in the Seychelles. “But you have to watch everyone. With all the turns on the course you may be giving a home-course advantage to someone like Campbell, though.”\nDrysdale, who began rowing 18 years ago at age 18, knows that at 6-foot-6, there’s precious little that he can do to duck down and avoid the wind-swept conditions that often rule the Charles.\n“I’ve gone out for a couple of rows. It’s pretty much the same conditions. (The wind) can bite you, but I have all the gear,” said Drysdale. “At other races like the Olympics and worlds, it’s six lanes, side-by-side and you just have to worry about going straight. But this course is unique. It’s always a hard race to win and that only makes it more special when you do win it. This race and course is completely different.\n“If you want to be the best sculler in the world, this is a race that you want to win. I’ve been very fortunate in my career to win many of the top races in different countries. But it’s always great to come here. The hospitality in Boston is fantastic. I love the crowd that’s always out there cheering.”\nThis year is the 51st Head of the Charles but it marks the 50th anniversary race as the 1996 event fell victim to the “100-year storm.” Weather forecasts call for mid-50s temperatures today and perhaps slightly colder tomorrow.\n“It’s an exciting time for me. I think we’re all breathing a little easier now that the wind velocity forecast has died for (today) and (tomorrow). So, we’ll have over 10,000 participants taking a nice little trip down the Charles River,” said executive director Fred V. Schoch.\nThe regatta, which features 63 events, is the subject of a commemorative book, “Head of the Charles Regatta First 50,” which chronicles the event through the years.\n“It keeps growing but we can’t get much bigger without adding a third day,” said Schoch, who will celebrate his 25th year association with the Head of the Charles. “It’s a bit of nostalgic look over my shoulder, for sure. But I couldn’t be more pleased with how the event has evolved and have my fingerprints on it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:54:30.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
