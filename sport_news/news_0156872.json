Gather ‘round flatscreen with pretzels and prayers. Gather where they wear Georgia red and black, or Alabama crimson. Be ready to tell those other guys to go to hell.\nBrothers and sisters, the time has come. Choose your side of the aisle, and enter the temple of football.\nThe University of Georgia plays the University of Alabama Saturday. You may have heard about it.\nThe gentlemen from Georgia are hosts to the young men from Alabama. After a few handshakes and other niceties, the Bulldogs (Georgia) and the Crimson Tide (the other guys) will proceed to bash heads. If an occasional uncharitable word is uttered, remember: this is big-time football in the South. Verily, the stakes are high.\nBecause these two SEC powerhouse rivals only meet every few years or so, interest when they do is intense. Tickets for prime seats on the so-called secondary market were going for up to $470 Friday, although heavy rain forecast for game day could dampen the demand.\nGary Louis, what do you think?\nLouis lives in Tuscaloosa. He owns Rama Jama’s , a restaurant whose patrons dine in the shadow of Bryant-Denny Stadium. The only way you can get a beer any closer to Alabama’s home field is to smuggle in a brew in your pants.\nYes, Alabama is smarting from an upset loss a few weeks back. No, that does not mean mean a low Tide Saturday.\n“I’m optimistic every time we play football,” said Louis. “You can say I’m quietly optimistic.”\nNo, you can’t because no, he’s not. Louis likes to talk Alabama football.\nHe remembers growing up in Montgomery. His earliest memories include listening to Alabama games — he, his dad and uncle on the front porch, leaning over a transistor radio. How could such a little box contain such huge heroics?\nSince then, he has been a Tide fanatic. Like thousands of others, he ground his teeth Sept. 19 when Alabama lost — lost! — its Southeastern Conference opener to Ole Miss. Ole Miss?!?\nLet’s toss some salt into this wound: Alabama is the underdog to the Dawgs.\n“We’re used to winning,” Louis said. “When we don’t win, it’s devastating.”\nDevastation is a possibility, said Loren Smith, of Athens. He’s a 1962 UGA graduate who briefly spent some time in Atlanta before deciding it was too far away from his alma mater. He returned and has never strayed too far from that temple of football. “My heart,” he said, “is in Athens.”\nHis butt will be in a seat at Sanford Stadium — yea, brethren, another temple — today. Smith hasn’t missed many UGA games.\nA Georgia victory won’t be easy, he predicted. The Crimson Tide, still smarting over that loss to Ole Miss, needs a win to remain in the running for the SEC crown, he said.\nAlabama Coach Nick Saban recruits big, tough players. Georgia coach Mark Richt will need an aerial assault to win, Smith thinks.\n“If we throw the ball successfully we have a great chance to win,” he said. “We’ll have to play above our heads.”\nOr check with Tony Barnhart, who knows a few things about this series. A former AJC sports reporter, Barnhart has been writing about football for decades. He’s seen a few UGA-Bama games. Some had a happy ending, with Athens in happy tumult.\nOthers? Consider the “blackout” game. Remember? In 2008, Richt outfitted his guys in black for the ‘Bama game. When the black-clad Dawgs chugged onto the field, they looked like an army of steam locomotives.\n‘Bama promptly put out their fire. Score: Tide 41, Dawgs 30.\n“Boy,” said Barnhart, “that was ugly.”\nThe best Georgia win over Alabama? Maybe that 1965 game when UGA came back to retire the Tide, 18-17.\nWhat made that win so sweet? Let’s check with the guy who had a sideline view, Vince Dooley.\nYes, that Dooley. The previous year, said Dooley, he was a new coach. In 1964, his first game at the helm of the Bulldogs was against that bunch from Tuscaloosa. His Dawgs would be chasing a quarterback named Namath, first name Joe. He would match wits against a guy named Bryant, nickname “Bear.” In the temple at Tuscaloosa, people still whisper that name.\nDooley was 31. He had a young man’s optimism. His team shared it.\nThat optimism — the team, too — got trampled that day. Score: ‘Bama 31, Georgia 3.\nThat whooping, Dooley recalled, was the equivalent of a slap in the face; the Bulldogs were suddenly wide awake. “It taught us to be a good football team by the end of that season,” he said.\nA year later, the Dawgs repaid that favor. Even now, talking about it a half-century later, Dooley had a smile in his voice.\nOK. The seconds are ticking down to kickoff. Dear reader, don your attire — Dawg or Tide, that’s up to you — and gather your fellow believers.\nThe temple doors are about to open.\nGeorgia vs. Alabama\nGeorgia’s bigger, better-educated, more mobile, wealthier and healthier than Alabama. Face it, the state to the left of us physically is probably to the right of us politically, but it’s definitely behind us in just about every other respect. Now, if someone will just inform the Crimson Tide… .\nIn the air and on the ground\nMajor airports Total passengers, 2014\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta 96.2 million (No. 1 in the world)\nBirmingham-Shuttlesworth 2.6 million (No. 1 in Alabama)\nSources: the two airports\nTotal interstate miles\nGeorgia 1,253\nAlabama 1,035\nSource: Federal Highway Administration\nPopulation demographics\n2014 population estimate\nGeorgia 10.1 million\nAlabama 4.8 million\nLargest metropolitan area by population\nAtlanta metro area 5.3 million\nBirmingham metro area 1.1 million\nMedian household income, 2013\nGeorgia $49,179\nAlabama $43,253\nPoverty rate, 2014\nGeorgia 18.3%\nAlabama 19.3%\nMedian value, owner-occupied housing, 2009-2013\nGeorgia $151,300\nAlabama $122,500\nBuilding permits, 2014\nGeorgia 39,423\nAlabama 13,369\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau\nEducation measures\nHigh school graduates, people older than 25, 2009-2013\nGeorgia 84.7%\nAlabama 83.1%\nBachelor’s degree or higher, people older than 25, 2009-2013\nGeorgia 28.0%\nAlabama 22.6%\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau\n% of students\nSAT, 2014 Scores Rank % taking test\nGeorgia 1,445 45 77.2%\nAlabama 1,617 22 6.7%\nSource: Commonwealth Foundation\n4-year graduation rates\nUniversity of Georgia 61%\nUniversity of Alabama 39%\nSource: U.S. News & World Report\nHealth statistics\nDeaths in 2013\nper 100,000 pop.
