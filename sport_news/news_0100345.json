For example, the nation's cancer death rate was near the bottom of a list that includes Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\nWhat's more, since 1995 that rate has been falling faster in the United States than in other nations.\nOn the other hand, when it comes to obesity rates and infant mortality, the United States did poorly compared to other nations.\nThe United States was pegged at spending slightly more than $9,000 per person per year on health care. This meant that, in sum, Americans spend more than 17 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on health care services.\nThat's roughly 50 percent more than the health care expenditures of any other country, the report noted.\nThe second-highest health care spender, Switzerland, spent only about $6,300 on each of its citizens annually, the findings showed.\nAnd while American life expectancy maxed out at just below 79, the more frugal Swiss can look forward to a life expectancy of nearly 83 years.\nAlthough the United States was the only country on the list that doesn't have universal health care coverage, the U.S. government was nevertheless shelling out far more money on health care than other developed nations, the investigators found.\nFor example, while the U.S. government spent almost $4,200 on health care per person (via Medicare and Medicaid) in 2013, the United Kingdom spent just $2,800 per person.\nAnd what did Americans get for all their health care bucks? Not so much, relatively speaking. While Americans tended to see their doctors about four times a year, on average, only three nations (Switzerland, New Zealand and Sweden) had lower doctor visit rates, the study found.\nStill, diagnostic services (such as PET and CT scans) were far more common in the United States. Meanwhile, apart from New Zealanders, Americans were the biggest adult consumers of prescription drugs.\nMore information\nHere's more on The Commonwealth Fund report ", "external_links": ["http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective/", "http://www.healthday.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:46:36.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
