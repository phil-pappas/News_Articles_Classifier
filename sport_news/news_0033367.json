(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) KANSAS CITY, MO (FOOTBALLKC) - \nAt the start of the second half the Kansas City offense was driving down the field, poised to extend their lead to 24-3 over Chicago. \nThen near the goal line on a Jamaal Charles carry, the Chiefs season outlook suffered a big loss. \nThe Pro-Bowl running back appears to have torn his right ACL - just a few years following an ACL tear to his left knee. Now taking his place will be backups Knile Davis and Charcandrick West. \nThe loss is a potential season killer based on how much Andy Reid and the Chiefs offense count on his success. Alex Smith has been very disappointing to start the season, and now they’ll have to rely on his arm for success. \nPrior to Charles’ injury, the star running back was able to count for 84 total yards on 13 touches. After Charles left, the Chiefs offense was unable to even take a drive into field goal range. \nWhat makes Charles so valuable is how even with bad line play and stacked defensive boxes, he still has the ability to make big plays. He is a rare speed back that is still physical, and able to churn yards in short situations. \nWithout Charles, it’s time for Smith to elevate his game. \nA 1-4 start to the season is almost impossible to overcome, but the team still has a very talented roster on both sides of the ball. This will be a big opportunity for West and Davis to showcase their skills, and for Smith to possibly pick up the slack. \nThe loss of Charles and second half collapse makes Sunday’s game on of the most devastating of the year, and the possible fatal blow to the Chiefs 2015 campaign. \nCharles will undergo an MRI Monday to determine the specific severity of the injury. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
