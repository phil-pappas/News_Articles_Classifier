For the historians out there, this weekend will mark the 90th meeting between the Bearkats and Lumberjacks and as they've done for several years, they will meet inside of NRG Stadium. \nSam Houston State comes in 1-2 including a close loss to Texas Tech to open the season while SFA has struggled with injuries and is 0-4 but ready to breakthrough with a victory. \nThe Bearkats come in winning the last 4 and 9 out of the last 11 meetings.
