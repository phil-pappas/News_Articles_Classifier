He was 81.\nMenifee’s City Council voted in June to hold a special election rather than appoint a replacement for Edgerton’s term, which expires in December 2016.\nThe special election is Nov. 3. According to a city staff report the election will cost approximately $25,000.\nOnly voters in the District 3 voting area – roughly the southeast quadrant of the city – can participate. City Clerk Kathy Bennett said 8,856 voters are registered in the district as of Friday.\nMenifee’s population now exceeds 85,000, a nearly 30 percent increase since it incorporated seven years ago. And at a recent candidates forum, speakers noted that the median age has dropped from 58 to 38 in that time.\nPrior to this election, businessman Stu Blaze’s biggest contribution to the city was bringing the Breakfast Club of Menifee diner to town. Blaze, 58, noted that project broke ground in 2008 during the throes of the recession.\n“We did it in Menifee because we live here,” Blaze said. “We thought the city needed something like that. And we were correct.”\nAaron Park, Blaze’s campaign manager, said the restaurant attracts as many as 4,000 customers weekly. Blaze said he is no longer involved in the operation of the Breakfast Club but that he now wants to put his experience to work on the City Council.\n“I want to be part of ensuring the growth in the city is balanced,” Blaze said. “I know why businesses come to cities.”\nDarcy Kuenzi has been a resident in the Menifee area for 23 years and was a member of the original City Council. In 2012, Scott Mann defeated her in the mayoral election.\n“I am back for more,” said Kuenzi, 52, who is a gov ernment affairs officer for the Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation District.\nPublic safety and traffic are two issues that Kuenzi said are on the minds of res idents. Securing financing for future road projects is a critical job for the council, as is working on a new model for the funding of public safety services, she said.\n“I have a proven record of common sense solutions and doing heavy lifting for the city,” Kuenzi said.\nLike Kuenzi, Lesa Sobek has lived in the area for over 20 years, long before it was known as Menifee. A member of the planning commission since 2013, Sobek’s history of community involvement dates back to her earliest days here, after she and her husband moved from Riverside.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc86b-b88539922z.120151016170124000g72ckdqs.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc86a-b88539922z.120151016170124000g72ckdoo.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc86b-b88539922z.120151016170124000g72ckdrg.10.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/IheartMenifee", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc86b-b88539922z.120151016170124000g72ckdr9.10.jpg", "http://facebook.com/lesasobekforcitycouncil2015", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc86a-b88539922z.120151016170124000gk4ckr49.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc86b-b88539922z.120151016170124000g72ckdr9.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc86b-b88539922z.120151016170124000g72ckdqs.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc86b-b88539922z.120151016170124000g72ckdrg.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwc86a-b88539922z.120151016170124000gk4ckr49.10.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/neil.winter.71", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwc86a-b88539922z.120151016170124000g72ckdoo.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:20:41.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
