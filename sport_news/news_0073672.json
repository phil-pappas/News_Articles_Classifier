I’ve won a gold medal and was never tested three times in one day, in a span of 12 hours,” said Cejudo, who is scheduled to take on Jussier Formiga at UFC Fight Night: Monterrey, Mexico on Nov. 21. \n“As a fellow fighter, I can’t let that go down, I can’t live with myself. We’ve seen what other fighters have done and they’ve gotten a slap on the wrist.” \nCejudo’s refusal to fight in Vegas could have serious implications for the flyweight division, as Cejudo is likely in line for the next shot at Demetrious Johnson’s title if he beats Formiga. Johnson, though, has said he wants to fight on the UFC’s Super Bowl weekend pay-per-view card, which happens to be scheduled for Sin City. \nFor Cejudo, not even a shot at UFC gold will be enough to lure him into the octagon in Vegas. Even if the Diaz suspension is overturned, he believes that UFC fighters need to figure out a way to represent themselves against the powers that govern the sport. \nHe stopped short of calling for a union, but make no mistake, a fighter of Cejudo’s profile calling for fighters to organize doesn’t happen every day. \n“Maybe the fighters need to start a board,” Cejudo said. “I’m afraid to even say the ‘u’ word because that’s a whole other article that’s going to be twisted around, but maybe we should start a board and some of the spearheads like Conor (McGregor) or Ronda Rousey … I think these are the cash-cows. Get these guys involved and everything changes.” \nDON’T RULE OUT VAL \nWhen it was announced that Canadian Valerie Letourneau was set to challenge women’s strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk for the 115 lbs. belt at UFC 193, there were plenty in the MMA world who snickered. \nLetourneau, after all, was nowhere near the top of the rankings when the fight was announced and Jedrzejczyk has looked, well, nearly invincible in the past year. \nTwo of Letourneau’s teammates at American Top Team, though, believe that with the right strategy the Montreal-native can walk away from November’s card in Melbourne, Australia with the belt. \n“She’s from my camp and I’m happy for her and I think she’s going to do well,” said Tecia Torres, who is ranked No. 5 in the women’s strawweight division. “It’s probably going to be a striking fight but (Letourneau) is going to need to be a point-fighter … In and out, don’t let her overwhelm you. \n“Joanna Champion’s the real deal.” \nThat’s a similar sentiment to the one expressed by fellow women’s strawweight Jessica Aguilar, who also trains with the Coconut Creek, Florida-based American Top Team. \n“I think she’s at the right gym,” Aguilar said with a smile. “They’re going to put together a great strategy and as long as she follows that through, she’ll do well. \n“There are holes in everyone’s game … (Jedrzejczyk) is world-class - her stand-up is amazing. We haven’t seen too much of her on the ground, so you never know, we haven’t seen that happen yet and hopefully we can see some of that happen with Valerie.” \nKEEP ’EM SEPARATED \nThe last time Sergio Pettis came to Texas, he was fighting on the undercard at UFC 185 back in March. Later in the night, his brother Anthony took on Rafael dos Anjos in a lightweight title fight. \nIt ended up being an awful night for the Pettis family, as Sergio was knocked out cold by Ryan Benoit and Anthony lost his belt following a thorough five-round beatdown by dos Anjos. \nDon’t expect to see the Pettis brothers fighting on the same card any time soon. \n“It was a lot less nerves (Saturday at UFC 192), most of the focus was on me,” Pettis said after beating Chris Cariaso by unanimous decision. “Last camp it was both of us together, so when I didn’t do good he had that added pressure later on Anthony. I think it’s better that we fight separate. \n“We love each other, I see the guys every day, so it was fun to fight on the same card but maybe it would be better for us to have our own selves and focus on the person fighting.” \nAROUND THE OCTAGON \nDon’t be surprised if Saturday night marks the last time fans see Francisco Trevino in the UFC octagon. The lightweight came in 5 lbs. overweight at Friday’s weigh-ins, only lasted 57 seconds against rookie Sage Northcutt in their Saturday night bout, and then shoved referee Herb Dean after the fight was stopped. That’s three strikes, and Trevino’s almost certainly out … Apparently Ronda Rousey will be on the cover of Men’s Fitness: Australia. Not sure why it’s news, but plenty of outlets thought it was … If you’re ever in Houston, don’t be afraid to dig into some seafood at Pappadeaux … Or barbecue at Rudy’s … Or Mexican at Ninfa’s on Navigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:56:49.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
