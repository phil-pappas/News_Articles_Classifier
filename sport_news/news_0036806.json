Comment Cheboygan Daily Tribune - Cheboygan, MI Writer Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 9:29 PM Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 9:29 PM Bay City, Mich. BAY CITY — The Cheboygan Chiefs knew coming in that stopping Bay City John Glenn running back Kristen Valliere would be a tall order. But while Valliere certainly made his presence known against the Chiefs, his teammate and fellow running back Tyler Monville wasn’t that bad either. Together, the duo torched the Chiefs, combining for five touchdown runs — three going to Valliere, and two thanks to Monville — to fuel the Bobcats to a dominating 41-7 victory in Bay City on Friday night. Valliere finished with 187 rushing yards while Monville ran for 137 yards to lead a powerful John Glenn rushing attack that finished with 410 yards. The loss was the fifth in a row for the Chiefs, who dropped to 1-6 on the season. Meanwhile, the Bobcats (5-2) kept their playoff hopes alive with the win. Cheboygan’s night got off to a promising start when junior fullback Ethan Campeau broke loose and scampered 56 yards for a touchdown on a fourth-and-1 play. A made PAT by Jeff Ostman made it a 7-0 Cheboygan lead early in the first quarter. However, the Chiefs’ advantage was short-lived as the Bobcats responded with a touchdown drive of their own capped off by a four-yard run from Valliere, tying the game 7-7. John Glenn would then capitalize off Cheboygan’s first of three turnovers in the game game when Tyler Senk raced 45 yards for a TD, putting the Bobcats up 14-7 with 5:30 left in the first. The Bobcats would take that seven-point lead going into the second quarter. Valliere added a four-yard score in the second quarter, helping the Bobcats build a 20-7 halftime lead. Valliere’s night was far from over as the talented John Glenn tailback raced 73 yards for a TD, increasing the Bobcats’ lead to 27-7 early in the third quarter. Monville added to John Glenn’s huge rushing night, scoring on a 43-yard run on the first play of the fourth quarter to make it a 34-7 lead. On John Glenn’s next possession, Monville raced 90 yards for a TD to give the Bobcats a 41-7 lead with 5:23 to play. Campeau finished with 95 yards on 11 carries and a TD to lead Cheboygan’s rushing attack, while junior quarterback Mike Radle carried 14 times for 84 yards, Dan Pearson tallied 46 rushing yards, Logan Mills added 45, and Hayden Schneider had a 24-yard run. Radle made his first career start at quarterback back for Cheboygan in place of senior signal-caller Zach Socha, who was out due to injury. Radle completed just one of eight passes for eight yards. As a team, Cheboygan rushed for 211 yards on the night. On defense, Jack Ormsbee led the Chiefs with 15 tackles, while sophomore Trent Brandau had 14, Tristan Jarman had 10, Garrett Lindgren had eight, and Campeau and Radle had seven apiece.
