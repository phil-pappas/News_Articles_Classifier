(AP) - Prosecutors say the conduct of a former student at an elite New Hampshire prep school convicted of sexually assaulting a freshman days before he graduated justifies a felony conviction of using a computer to lure her for sex.\nA jury in August convicted 19-year-old Owen Labrie, of Tunbridge, Vermont. His trial included lurid details that exposed a practice at St. Paul's School in Concord known as Senior Salute, in which graduating students try to have sex with younger classmates.\nLabrie's lawyers want a judge to dismiss the felony conviction for using a computer to arrange their May 2014 encounter. If the conviction stands, Labrie would be ordered to register as a sex offender for life. Prosecutors say in their brief filed Thursday that it doesn't constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:55:28.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
