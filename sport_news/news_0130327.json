(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) \nA look at what’s happening around the major leagues Wednesday: \n___ \nSERIES, SERIOUSLY? \nThe New York Mets and Kansas City Royals can clinch spots in the World Series. The Mets try to sweep the Cubs in the NL Championship Series at Wrigley Field (8:07 p.m. EDT). The Royals aim to close out the ALCS in Game 5 at Toronto (4:07 p.m. EDT). \n___ \nTHE MIGHTY MURPH \nDaniel Murphy has homered in five straight postseason games for the Mets, tying the major league record set by Carlos Beltran in 2004. Murphy’s shot Tuesday night was his sixth in his 30th playoff at-bat this year; he’s hit just 62 in 3,354 career at-bats in the regular season. “Question is, who is this guy?” Mets manager Terry Collins said. \n___ \nSWINGS AND THINGS \nAlcides Escobar admits he’s not the most patient leadoff man. He likes to swing at the first pitch. But there’s no denying his results with the Royals. He’s 9 for 15 in the ALCS and has gotten a hit leading off the first inning in all four games. \n___ \nIT’S ALL NEW \nMets rookie Steven Matz pitches vs. the Cubs for the first time. “I think it’s going to be a lot of fun. I’ve never been here before or played here before or never even seen a game here,” the 24-year-old lefty said before New York beat the Cubs 5-2 in Game 3. Jason Hammel starts for the Cubs. \n___ \nHE’S HOT \nEdinson Volquez starts for the Royals, having won Game 1 with six shutout innings. He says he recalls telling catcher Salvador Perez that “I feel sexy throwing down and away” during the win. Marco Estrada pitches for the Blue Jays.
