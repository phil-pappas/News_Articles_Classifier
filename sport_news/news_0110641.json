Barrett named Ohio State's starting QB USA Today Sports 11 hrs ago by Daniel Uthman, USA TODAY Sports Ohio State coach Urban Meyer announced Tuesday that for the first time this season, sophomore J.T. Barrett will be the Buckeyes’ starting quarterback instead of junior Cardale Jones.\nAdChoices “J.T has earned the right to start Saturday at Rutgers,” Meyer said on the Big Ten football coaches weekly teleconference.\nMeyer said he based the decision on “sheer production.”\n“Cardale’s going to be an active part too,” Meyer said. “It was a difficult decision, but red zone production and third down production were the two areas that made a difference.”\nOhio State is 7-0 and ranked No. 1 in the Amway Coaches Poll, but Jones has not excelled in various aspects of the game in recent weeks.\nOn Oct. 17 against Penn State, Jones was 9 for 15 passing for 84 yards before giving way to Barrett, who led the Buckeyes to three second-quarter touchdowns. Barrett replaced Jones permanently after two scoreless drives in the third quarter.\nFor the game, Barrett had two touchdowns passing and two rushing.\nOverall, Barrett is Ohio State's second leading rusher and has rushed or passed for nine touchdowns in intermittent action. He is completing 61.4% of his passes compared to Jones' 62.4 and is averaging 7.9 yards per rushing attempt. Jones has thrown for seven touchdowns and rushed for one, but he also has thrown seven interceptions.\nMeyer said he’s never at peace with the position during the season, but “I’ve got two great guys who I have a tremendous amount of respect for, and I’m just trying to do the right thing.”\nOhio State plays at Rutgers on Saturday (8 p.m. ABC).\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;J.T.", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/22HcFuodTI9?data-mcuid=7d00c4a52b&data-mccampaign=55b655caa6", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Who", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Was", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfER1X.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA2eh8&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Find", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmfMp4.img&quot;}}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_ncaa&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfDxBQ.img&quot;}}", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgzWe.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Michigan"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:36:49.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
