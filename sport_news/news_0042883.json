(AP) - A Dartmouth College fraternity that lost its recognition on campus after it was accused of branding new members is suing the town of Hanover and its zoning board over a ruling that keeps its members from living in their house.\nEighteen members of Alpha Delta, which partly inspired the 1978 movie \"Animal House,\" were ordered out after the fraternity lost its status as a student organization in April.\nThe Valley News reports ( http://bit.ly/1YR1wD6 ) the fraternity sued last month, saying the house was its residence before Hanover had a zoning ordinance. Town Manager Julia Griffin estimated the case could take at least a year.\nThe fraternity's lawyer has described the branding as voluntary self-expression. The college concluded it didn't amount to hazing, but cited previous misconduct in revoking the fraternity's recognition.\nInformation from: Lebanon Valley News, http://www.vnews.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
