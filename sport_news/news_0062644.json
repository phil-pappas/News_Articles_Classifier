January responded with one jump shot, then another, to extend the Indiana Fever’s lead to eight as the arena grew silent. \nIn the fourth quarter, as the clock neared the two-minute mark, January split the defense for a lay-in. Soon thereafter, she added yet another jumper to push the Fever ahead by five. \nThe Fever secured a 75-69 victory Sunday, giving them a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five WNBA Finals. It was a showcase for January, a perennial all-defensive team selection who scored a season-high 19 points. How the Fever were built, player by player \n“She’s the key to that team,” Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said. “I know everybody is talking about (Tamika) Catchings, and that’s true. But when you have a point guard that’s getting things done at that level – she scored 19 and had us twisted – that says a lot about her.” \nThe Lynx are 18-2 under Reeves in the playoffs, and both losses were to the Fever in Game 1s of WNBA Finals. The Lynx will try to even the series Tuesday (ESPN2, 8 p.m.). \nGame 3 will be Friday and Game 4 (if necessary) next Sunday, both at Indianapolis. \nJanuary started 0-of-5 from the field but finished 6-of-14. She was 6-of-6 on free throws and added four rebounds and six assists. \nOne moment in which she lost her cool was when she fouled out with 1:12 left. She was restrained by teammates but assessed a technical. January said Maya Moore “jumped out of bounds” like pro wrestler Hulk Hogan, inducing the call from official Sue Blauch. January pointed to a bleeding cut on her face that she said came from the collision.
