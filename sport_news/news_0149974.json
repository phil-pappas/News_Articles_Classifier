He revealed this after United emerged victorious in their second Champions League group stage match against Wolfsburg on Wednesday night. \nYou can see Mata’s exceptional accuracy and extreme precision in the embedded YouTube video below of Mata accepting the blindfolded free kick challenge. \nWatch below as Mata nails all four kicks, without the aid of sight, over a five man dummy wall: \nAs he said, if you think that’s too easy for him, post what you want him to do in the comments section of his YouTube video. \nWednesday night Juan Mata equalized on a penalty kick in the first half. Defender Chris Smalling would find the back of the net in the second half to complete the scoring in that game. \nYou can see the footage of that brace below, pay special attention to the final pass, from Juan Mata, it was world-class. The final pass from Juan Mata for this goal is fully sick. How the hell man https://t.co/6TuJ3ZSGGv \n— Miikka Lehtonen (@soralapio) September 30, 2015 \nAfter tonight’s result, Mata has scored or assisted on 45% of United’s goals in 2015-16. After the match, he revealed that he is now United’s designated penalty kick taker. \nJuan Mata told BT Sport : “The manager makes a list of penalty takers and I’m the first right now so I have confidence.” \n“It was a very tough game. We were defending in the last minutes because we were physically very tired. They were pushing and pushing but I think we did what we had to do which was win after the first game that we lost in Holland, and we are happy today.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:49:51.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
