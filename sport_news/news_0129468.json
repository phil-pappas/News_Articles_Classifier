That was clearly handball.\"\nThe hosts were left enraged after the narrow loss, Cologne sports director Jorg Schmadtke taking aim at Dankert, while making a pointed reference to the country's football authorities.\n\"It's irritating that we had a 'handball' referee,\" he said. \"If 48,700 people saw it, the four match officials needed too as well. Give our regards to the German Football Association.\"\nCologne midfielder Marcel Risse made no attempt to disguise his opinion.\n\"In my view, you could clearly see it was handball,\" he said.\nAnd those sentiments were echoed by Horn.\n\"I was expecting a clear whistle,\" he said. \"An illegal goal has cost us the points.\"\nHannover captain Christian Schulz, meanwhile, was at least gracious enough to acknowledge his team's good fortune.\n\"There are no ifs or buts, that was a lucky win for us,\" he said. \"The bottom line is FC [Cologne] were superior.\"\nThe result left Hannover 14th on the table, two points outside the automatic relegation place. Cologne is six points better off in sixth spot.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:55:31.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
