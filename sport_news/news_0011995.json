Bruce Ely/The Oregonian The husband of a Gresham woman accused of fatally shooting their son was found dead on Sunday, police say.\nGresham police officers responded around 6:20 p.m. to a home in the 2800 block of Southeast Rosefinch Drive after a relative reported finding 43-year-old Ryan Davidoff unconscious, according to Gresham police Capt. Claudio Grandjean. He died at the scene from an apparent overdose of medication.\nNo foul play is suspected, Grandjean said. Family members told officers that Ryan Davidoff did not appear to be emotionally distressed in the days before his death, according to Grandjean.\nThe Multnomah County Medical Examiner's Office said its waiting on a toxicology report before ruling on Davidoff's cause of death. It takes at least four months to get those results.\nPolice responded to the same home on Sept. 24 and found 17-year-old Jacob Davidoff had been shot dead. His 42-year-old mother, Dianne Davidoff, was arrested the same day on charges of murder and unlawful use of a weapon.\nThe mother pleaded not guilty to the charges on Oct. 6 in Multnomah County Circuit Court. A judge ruled the next day that she was unable to assist in her defense and ordered she be taken to the Oregon State Hospital in Salem for a psychiatric evaluation, court records show. Dianne Davidoff is scheduled to next appear in court for a hearing on Dec. 9.\n-- Everton Bailey Jr.\nebailey@oregonian.com\n503-221-8343; @EvertonBailey", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/evertonbailey", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/2800+SE+Rosefinch+Dr,+Gresham,+OR+97080/@45.4774822,-122.3703799,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x5495999612285d83:0x65f71126616a519c"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:24:01.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
