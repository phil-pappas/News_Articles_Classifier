But he came up bid down the stretch and finished with 73 yards on 18 attempts and a touchdown, and caught eight passes for 74 yards.

One play later, Potter hit Billy Freeman on a screen pass to his left, and Freeman rumbled in behind his blockers, as the Spartans tied the game, 10-10. \nThe Spartans defense came up big again, forcing the Rebels out in three plays, and Potter went right back to work. The drive was highlighted by a 42-yard completion to Tyler Winston, his longest reception of the season, and culminated when Potter ran it in from 20 yards out to give the Spartans a 17-10 lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:09:34.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
