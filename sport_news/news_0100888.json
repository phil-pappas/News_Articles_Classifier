We've got good receivers, and everybody can make plays. I'm pretty sure I thought I'd have to wait my turn because I knew Mike was in front of me. Really this year, I'm just trying to learn everything about college football. I'm learning a lot from Mike and Charone. As things go on, my time is improving on the field, and I'm just trying to make plays.” \nCain finally saw some daylight in the third quarter when he hauled in a 21-yard reception. Cain appeared ready to break a long one, but tripped over the 40-yard line trying to be like Deon Sanders. His trip didn’t matter – Zac Brooks Zac Brooks #24 6-0, 200Jonesboro, AR View Full Profile took the next play 35 yards for a touchdown – but Cain knows he might be the subject of teasing for the trip. \n“I tried to do a little Deon Sanders - a little somethin', somethin' - and I tripped,” he said. “I just tried to make it up on the next play. I might be on Vine or something like that, but I don't mind. It's a blessing that my opportunity is coming. I'm just working hard every day throughout practice. Every day, Coach Swinney just encourages us to get our practice habits up more, so I'm getting better in things like that. I'm just trying to execute in the games.” \nCain said the coaches were confident they would be able to exploit Tech’s secondary, giving Cain his chance to shine. \n“When we were studying the film, we thought we could open up the passing game,” Cain said. “Last week, we were trying to do that, too, but we couldn't because of the weather. This was the week to show everyone that we have top receivers that can make plays. It's not just one or two receivers; we have multiple receivers.” \nCo-offenisve coordinator and wide receivers coach Jeff Scott Jeff Scott Co-Offensive Coordinator / WR View Full Profile said he was happy to see the Florida native contribute. \n“Deon is a guy that shows flashes. He is very talented, but he is a true freshman that played quarterback in high school,” Scott said. “So he has had to learn a lot. But he’s a guy that you will see getting better and better each week. We thought in the Notre Dame game we would have the set up to get him the ball, but it didn’t happen, so it was good to see him go out there and make some plays in big situations.” \nCain said his level of confidence is growing. \n“My confidence level is always high. It's never low, so I'm just going to keep raising it going forward,” he said. “I think I improved more in my route running and blocking. I had a few good little blocks, and I'm just trying to improve on anything. There's always something to improve - route running, getting off press coverage.” \nIt helps that he has fellow Florida native and friend Ray-Ray McCloud Ray-Ray McCloud", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:01:14.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
