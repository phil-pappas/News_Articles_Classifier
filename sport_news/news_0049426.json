But Saturday’s victory over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets proves the No. 6 Clemson Tigers are in this college football thing to win it. One week after knocking off the then-No. 6 Notre Dame Fighting Irish by two points, the Tigers refused to rest on their laurels by dominating the struggling Yellow Jackets in a 43-24 NCAA gridiron battle at Clemson, S.C. “That just speaks to the mentality of our team,” Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney told clemsontigers.com post-game when asked about his charges not succumbing to a letdown a week after defeating the Fighting Irish in what was an emotional affair, also in Death Valley. “We truly have a windshield mentality — it’s all about what’s in front of us and not what’s behind us.“This is a focused team.” Focused enough to be a national championship contender, it appears. The two victories seven days apart drive not only Clemson’s record to 5-0 but the team’s confidence to new heights. The Tigers had been running second in the ACC to the Florida State Seminoles for the last handful of seasons but finally are clearly in the conference driver’s seat with the downing of Notre Dame and the stuff of Georgia Tech. Yes, the Ramblin’ Wreck have turned what was a promising campaign into a mess with four straight losses, including Saturday’s drop in Death Valley. But the way Clemson halted them was inspirational. Allowing the dangerous triple-option Tech offence to rush for just 71 yards shows the Tigers own sharp claws defensively. That’s the first time since 2009 Georgia Tech has been held to fewer than 100 yards rushing in a game.“I’m juiced — I’m really happy for our guys,” Clemson’s defensive co-ordinator Brent Venables told clemsontigers.com. “That’s a really special win for our guys regardless of Georgia Tech’s situation.” Meanwhile, on the other side of the ball, sophomore QB Deshaun Watson paced the Clemson attack to 537 yards of total offence.“Hats off to the team — the guys came ready to play,” Swinney told clemsontigers.com. “Just good contributions from the whole team.“Another great day in the valley.” SECOND & LONG Speaking of Notre Dame and the triple-option offence, the No. 15 Irish rebounded from last week’s loss to Clemson to put away the Navy Midshipmen and their ground-and-pound attack 41-24 on Saturday … LSU Tigers RB Leonard Fournette has one less man on his tail in the chase for the Heisman Trophy after Georgia Bulldogs RB Nick Chubb came down awkwardly on his leg on the first play from scrimmage Saturday afternoon. The injury was so ugly to see that even CBS analyst Gary Danielson declared it made him sick to his stomach … Without Chubb, No. 19 Georgia (4-2) blew a 21-point lead to lose to the host Tennessee Volunteers (3-3) 38-31. So Georgia’s out of national title talk for good … Meanwhile, Fournette and No. 7 LSU (5-0), behind 158 rushing yards from Fournette and 164 from backfield mate Derrius Grace, powered to a 45-24 win over the South Carolina Gamecocks (2-4), who played their home game at LSU’s Death Valley due to flooding in Columbia, S.C. … Not sure what to make of Tennessee’s charcoal-base uniforms — very strange with the traditional Volunteer orange accent, though. THIRD & GOAL Looked like another ‘uh-oh, here we go again’ moment for the No. 1 Ohio State Buckeyes when the struggling Maryland Terrapins (2-4) got the game’s first TD. The Buckeyes (6-0) got the 49-28 victory, but again, it was a struggle for the top-ranked team that’s failing to dominate despite winning 19-straight tilts … The loss should seal head coach Randy Edsall’s future at Maryland … This just in: The Kansas Jayhawks (0-5) are terrible, as they allowed TE LaQuan McGowan, a mammoth 410-pounder, to take a pass and rumble 18 yards for a major for the No. 3 Baylor Bears (5-0). The TD was part of a hefty 66-7 beatdown by the visiting Bears, who rolled to a beefy 52-7 lead at halftime … Haven’t said this in darn near a decade, but the No. 18 Michigan Wolverines (5-1) are a Big Ten threat, as they hung a 38-0 shutout on the upstart No. 13 Northwestern Wildcats (5-1), who were looking like conference darkhorses themselves coming in to Week 6. Big Blue’s D held the Wildcats to just 168 total yards. Go Blue! FOURTH & INCHES Just when you put trust in the No. 10 Oklahoma Sooners (4-1), they go and lay an egg against an underwhelming opponent, losing the Red River Rivalry in Dallas to the terrible Texas Longhorns (2-4). Certainly credit the Longhorns for long-missing brilliant play-calling and execution — they out-yarded the Sooners 368-278 — but OK fell victim to poor tackling and unmotivated play from the start in a 24-17 loss. That loss knocks Oklahoma from the title conversation … RB Jordan Canzeri ran for a whopping 256 yards to keep the No. 22 Iowa Hawkeyes (22-0) unbeaten with a 29-20 edge of the never-say-die Illinois Fighting Illini (4-2) … Also in the AP Top 25: The No. 14 Ole Miss Rebels (5-1) ran over the New Mexico State Aggies (0-5) 52-3; and the No. 24 Toledo Rockets (5-0) stopped the Kent State Golden Flashes (2-4) 38-7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:09:38.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
