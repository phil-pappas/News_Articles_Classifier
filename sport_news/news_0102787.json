The storm made landfall Friday evening on Mexico's Pacific coast as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph) but it is rapidly losing steam as it moves over a mountainous region inland from the shore. Rebecca Blackwell AP A couple looked out to sea at Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Friday as Hurricane Patricia approached as a monster Category 5 storm, the strongest ever in the Western Hemisphere. By Saturday morning, however, it had dropped to tropical storm level. Rebecca Blackwell AP 1 of 5 \ntjohnson@mcclatchydc.com Mexico City \nHurricane Patricia, once billed as one of the most powerful storms ever recorded, dropped massive rains on Mexico’s Pacific coast Saturday as it quickly dropped to tropical storm strength. \nDamage reports were still coming in. Tweets and photos from people on the ground indicated heavy damage and mass flooding in the towns of Cuixmala, which suffered a direct hit when the hurricane made landfall, and in Emiliano Zapata, Costa Careyes and Melaque, towns on or near the coast of Jalisco state. \nOne photo showed fronds mostly shorn from palm trees in Costa Careyes, a private luxury resort. The website for Costa Careyes describes it as a place where guests experience “spectacular natural beauty, breathtaking setting and sybaritic quality of life.” \nBut there were no reports of deaths, and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, in a video released to the nation, offered a note of distinct relief. \n“The early reports confirm that damage has been less than what a hurricane of this magnitude could cause,” Peña Nieto said. “Nevertheless, it is very important that people stay in shelters. Security forces are patrolling the streets to protect your homes.” \nPatricia faded almost as fast as it grew, its strength sapped by landfall and a coastal mountain range that blocked its path. A onetime frightening Category 5 hurricane with 200-mile-per-hour winds, greater than any storm in modern recorded history, Patricia’s winds were 135 mph when it made landfall at 6:18 p.m. in coastal Jalisco state. \nWhen daylight arrived Saturday, its top sustained winds were barely 50 miles per hour, although heavy waves continued to pound the coast. \n“Rapid weakening is expected to continue, and Patricia is forecast to become a tropical depression later today and dissipate tonight,” the National Hurricane Center in Miami said in a bulletin Saturday morning. \nTens of thousands of evacuees remained in more than 1,000 shelters set up at army barracks, schools and other facilities in the states of Colima, Jalisco and Nayarit. \nMexico’s National Meteorological Service said the tropical storm was moving quickly past Zacatecas state toward the northeast at 21 miles per hour. While sustained winds were at 50 mph, occasional gusts hit 90 mph, it said. \nIt warned that parts of Jalisco state, home to the industrial hub of Guadalajara, were still experiencing hurricane force winds but added that wind speeds were diminishing quickly. \nHeaviest rain fell on the snow-capped Nevado de Colima, an active volcano in southwestern Jalisco state. The Meteorological Service said it recorded slightly more than 15 inches of rain there by 3 a.m. Also hit hard with rain was Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico’s most important deepwater port, located in Michoacan state. It got 10 inches of rain, the service said. \n“Because recent rains that have softened the ground, one could see mud slides, landslides, overflowing rivers and streams and damage to roads, as well as flooding in lower areas,” the service warned. \nPuerto Vallarta, Mexico’s fourth most important destination for U.S. tourists, was largely spared. News reports said the oceanfront city of 200,000 residents did not even lose power.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:50:21.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
