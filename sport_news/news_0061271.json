(Image Source: Alex Goodlett/Getty Images) \nAround the NFL in Week 6: \n-Undrafted: \nComing out of little-known Tiffin University, New York Jets RB Chris Ivory went undrafted in 2010. On Sunday, in New York’s 34-20 win over the Washington Redskins, Ivory went off for 146 yards (TD), following up his 166-yard (TD) effort in Week 4 against the Miami Dolphins in London. He’s just the fourth undrafted player to have consecutive 140-yard games, joining the Los Angeles Rams Tank Younger (1954), the Arizona Cardinals Marcel Shipp (2003) and the Denver Broncos C.J. Anderson (2014). \n-Close Calls: \nThere were seven games decided by a touchdown or less in Week 6 for a total of 47 games that were within seven points this season, the second-most such games through six weeks in the history of the NFL. The most was in 1999 when there were 50. \n-Free Football: \nAs part of the seven games that were decided by seven points or less in Week 6, two went to overtime. That’s the third-straight week that has featured multiple overtime games, which is the most since a four-week stretch in 2012. The nine OT games this season are the third most in NFL history after six weeks. There were 12 games in 1995 that went to an extra period and 10 in 1983. \n-Offensive Explosion: \nThrough six weeks, there have been 4,243 points scored, which is the second-most points at this point in the season. Last year, there were 4,250 points scored heading into Week 7. The league average is 46.63 points per game, which would be the second-highest scoring average in NFL history. The all-time record is 46.82 points per game set in 2013. \n-Winning! \nQB Peyton Manning has had a rocky start to the season but his team hasn’t. The Denver Broncos are 6-0 and that’s the sixth time Manning has quarterbacked a team to a 6-0 start, which is the most by any signal caller in NFL history. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
