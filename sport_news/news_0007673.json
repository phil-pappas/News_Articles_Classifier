Sources deep inside the confines of Lucas Oil Stadium are anxious to see how the Pats quarterback feels and deals with this bit of chicanery engineered by NFL headquarters in New York and You Know Who!\n“If we get Brady Boy to toss around these game balls, we can nail him after their opening series and have the referee kick him out of the game by the second quarter,” informed the source.\n“Devious? Indeed. But what other way are we going to have a chance to win. We will have better Luck against Jimmy Garappolo than with our own Andy, that’s if he wants to play this week.”\nSo much has been pumped up about this Sunday night gala, most will think that it must be on the level thanks to all the PSI saga of the offseason.\nHowever, these are the Colts, baby, and babies they always are, so a little scrutiny on their part will be overlooked by the High Lord Commissioner.\n“It’s all been worked out,” added the source. “The NFL will turn the other way like it’s always want to do in everything non-Patriot. I’ve been told because Brady beat that four-game suspension, the league will nail him this week on the road where he can’t run back to the locker room and work things out with his hometown Deflator. We’re gonna get that Brady for sure.”\nAs for the game, Indy isn’t exactly running scared from the Patriots but it is running, and it knows getting Tommy Boy out of the game is its best way to avoid another pummeling.\nThen again, they are the Colts. Pummel away.\nUndeflatable:\nPatriots (-10 ) at Indianapolis — With all the talk since the schedule came out in April of the Patriots raining mayhem at every instance on the Colts, wouldn’t it be something if the game was actually close. It really just may be. Pats, 53-6 .\nFoliage follies:\nDenver (-4 ) at Cleveland — OK, so the Broncos haven’t beaten anyone worthy of the Arena Football League but they and spaghetti-arm Peyton Manning still remain big pains. Broncos, 23-12 .\nCincinnati (-3) at Buffalo — I believe? I believe in the Bengals. For this week, anyway. Bengals, 23-16 .\nKansas City at Minnesota (-4 ) — It’s all over for the Chiefs. KC now roots for the Royals. Vikings, 27-14 .\nHouston at Jacksonville (pick ) — Hey, Bill O’Brien, did you learn anything while with the Patriots? Jaguars, 17-16 .\nChicago at Detroit (-3) — Just like Matthew Stafford, beating a sub-.500 team. Whoopee! Lions, 28-13 .\nWashington at N.Y. Jets (-6) — The Jets can’t be this good. Redskins, 16-13 .\nArizona (-3 1 ⁄ 2 ) at Pittsburgh — Michael Vick got his miracle win last week. Now he has to play a defense. Cardinals, 24-10 .\nMiami at Tennessee (-1 1 ⁄ 2 ) — Good place for a Dolphins revival to begin a one-week stint. Dolphins, 21-16 .\nCarolina at Seattle (-7 ) — The Seahawks aren’t for real anymore but the perfect Panthers aren’t either. Seahawks, 24-20 .\nSan Diego at Green Bay (-10 1 ⁄ 2 ) — If Vick can tear apart the Chargers secondary, what will give here — a lot! Packers 34-16 .\nBaltimore (-2 1 ⁄ 2 ) at San Francisco — Two teams that recently were pretty good ones. And now bad fits them oh-so nicely. 49ers, 27-24 .\nN.Y. Giants at Philadelphia (-4) — It’s fly-or-bye time for the Eagles. They wing it. Eagles, 30-20 .\nLast week: 5-8-1.\nSeason: 34-41-2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:47:55.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
