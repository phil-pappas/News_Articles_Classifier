STAN LIM, FILE PHOTO Related article » IF YOU GO What: The Moreno Valley City Council will discuss making its agendas public earlier and rescheduling meetings to avoid conflicts with the Moreno Valley school board.\nWhen: 6 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 27\nWhere: City Hall, 14177 Frederick St., Moreno Valley\nMoreno Valley may start making its agendas available to the public sooner, giving residents more time to review proposals before City Council votes.\nThe council will consider the change Tuesday, Oct. 27, along with a separate proposal that would change its meeting schedule so it doesn’t conflict with the Moreno Valley Unified School District board.\nUnder city policy, council agendas must be posted five days before meetings and are usually available Thursday before a Tuesday meeting. The Brown Act, the state’s open-meeting law, requires agendas be posted at least 72 hours in advance.\nIn a report to the council, City Manager Michelle Dawson suggested 12 or eight days as among the options the council may consider.\nIf approved, Moreno Valley would be following the lead of Riverside, which last month started making its city council agendas available 12 days in advance. It had previously published agendas five days in advance but made the changes as part of several measures by new Riverside City Manager John Russo to improve the public’s access to city government.\nIn her report, Dawson cited the same benefits for Moreno Valley in offering the public more time to review agendas.\nThe proposal would still allow council members to add urgent items to the agenda after its posting by a majority vote.\nCouncilman George Price said he supports the potential change, noting that residents often have only the weekend to learn about controversial items on the agenda. For it to work, he said, council members need to be conscientious about not adding last-minute items as happens now.\n“We need to be aware of the deadline as much, if not more, than staff,” Price said.\nA separate item would resolve a conflict that some residents have complained about and that the council asked to be addressed earlier this year.\nBoth the council and the school board meet on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month.\nThe council would switch its regular meetings to the first and third Tuesdays, under the proposal. The council would also go from two to one study session a month – held the second Tuesday of each month. That would leave a conflict between the school board and council study session once a month.\nAs an alternative, interim City Attorney Steve Quintanilla wrote in a report that meetings could be set for Mondays or Wednesdays.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9558 or ighori@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp2zc-b88548474z.120151023153800000grvcorcp.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp2zb-b88548474z.120151023153800000grvcorcd.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp2zb-b88548474z.120151023153800000grvcorcd.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwp2zc-b88548474z.120151023153800000grvcorcp.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:23:55.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
