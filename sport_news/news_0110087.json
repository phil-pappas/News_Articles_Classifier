(AP) - Depositions have begun after a former Dartmouth College researcher sued the college and a senior scientist, saying he took credit for one of her ideas and fired her for refusing to go along.\nThe Valley News reports Manana Tsulukidze filed the lawsuit in January. It states that Glyn Elwyn, the center's highest-ranking researcher, wrote an article using Tsulukidze's ideas but did not credit or acknowledge her.\nIt says Elwyn pressured Tsulukidze to credit him for a study she had devised and threatened to withhold a reference she would've needed after her fellowship ended.\nShe says she was fired after complaining to college officials.\nTsulukidze has requested a jury trial.\nDartmouth and Elwyn deny that she was plagiarized and that the decision not to renew her contract was retaliation.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
