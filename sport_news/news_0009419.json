That same duo netted the second goal before Jade Lowe fired off a quick shot and picked up the third goal as New Canaan moves on to the next round of the CT Cup. On Sunday, New Canaan’s defense was tested at the start by FUSA Red Fusion as Maiah Oyekanmi, Emma Lamaker, Angelia Megdanis, Meghan Driscoll, Kiera Mastey and Ashley Barton worked hard to keep the ball out of the New Canaan goal against four shots. However, FUSA was able to capitalize on a direct kick. In the second half, forwards Avery Minter, Hollis Mulry, Hadley Beiles and Kaleigh Griffiths helped put on the pressure, and Harden fired a shot from the right and hit the far upper corner of the goal to tie the score. Harden then passed to Grace Crowell for the game-winner.
