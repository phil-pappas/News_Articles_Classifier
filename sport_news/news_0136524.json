We weren’t as clean on the run fits in the second quarter. \n\"At the end of the game it was also disappointing. In eight-man fronts we weren’t as clean in our run fits either.” Oct 3, 2015; Columbia, MO, USA; South Carolina Gamecocks quarterback Lorenzo Nunez (19) runs with the ball as Missouri Tigers defensive lineman Josh Augusta (97) chases during the second half at Faurot Field.
