And it sort of took off from there. \n\"I've had nothing but a smile on my face ever since Augie and I started talking. I finally got my official Rox polo shirt, so I am totally fired up.\" \nNewman, now 55 years old, brings a lot of experience to the Rox coaching staff. \nHe spent eight seasons in Major League Baseball as an infielder, playing for the Montreal Expos (1985-86), the Twins (1985-91) and the Texas Rangers (1992), before retiring after the 1992 season. He was also a part of the 1987 and 1991 World Series Championships with the Twins. \nStory continues below.

(Photo: Jason Wachter, jwachter@stcloudtimes.com) \nNewman got involved in coaching soon after his playing career ended. He was the manager of the Twins' AA team, the New Britain Rock Cats, in 1996 and 1997, the bench coach for the Twins' AAA affiliate, the Salt Lake City Buzz, in 1998 and the manager of the Twins' rookie league Gulf Coast League from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, following the retirement of Twins manager Tom Kelly, Newman accepted the job as the third base coach, which was formerly occupied by Ron Gardenhire, who was named Kelly's successor. Newman remained in that position until 2005. \n\"Back in the day, Andy MacPhail, the former Twins General Manager, and Terry Ryan (current Twins GM), they talked to me about becoming a minor league manager,\" Newman said. \"When they did that back in 1995, they told me that I had the ability to teach, and I never forgot that. I've been doing that ever since, and I love it. \n\"Having played in the major leagues, coached in the major leagues and also coached in the minor leagues, I think me, mixed with Augie, will have the recipe that these young guys are looking for to help them get better.\" \nNewman most recently managed the Alexandria Blue Anchors from 2013 to 2015 and is very familiar with how things operate in the Northwoods League. \n\"I think it is an outstanding league,\" Newman said. \"I think it is the true test for the minor leagues. When players get drafted, they typically go to play 72 games, and this league I think gets them prepared mentally for the next step.\" \nRodriguez said the addition of Newman is huge for the coaching staff and the players. \n\"Anytime you can get get a major leaguer who has won two World Series Championships in your home state of Minnesota, it's a blessing from God,\" Rodriguez said. \"I've known him, and we have had a good relationship, since he took the manager job with the Blue Anchors. It's special to be able to introduce Al Newman to the St. Cloud Rox coaching staff.\" \nRox co-owner and Vice President Scott Schreiner said that Newman will serve mostly as a coach that helps with defense and hitting. \n\"Al brings a lot more to the defensive side of things,\" Rodriguez said. \"He is such a hard worker and his help and his knowledge will help us a lot.\" \nRodriguez added that Newman's experience might be enough to help get them to the next level as a team. \n\"Every baseball player's goal in life is to make it to the major leagues and to play in a World Series, and Al Newman has already been there and he has been in the World Series twice,\" Rodriguez said. \"I know that it will help all of the players and he will help us get the goal that we are trying to get to.\" \nNewman, who resides in Savage, is excited about getting the opportunity to get the know the Rox fans. \n\"The fans are awesome. I recall coming up here for different things and this area, being kind of close to Minneapolis, is a baseball haven,\" he said. \"Over the three years of going up against Augie, his teams are always prepared and that has always been appealing to me.\" \nNewman said he is very much looking forward to getting his first season underway in St. Cloud. \n\"I'm excited for what I can do to help the Rox,\" Newman said. \"I'm at home, now let's hope that we can now go out and win that championship.\" \nFollow Mitchell Hansen on Twitter @M_Hansen13 . 3 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/sports/rox/2015/10/12/newman-excited-join-rox/73694668/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:42:28.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
