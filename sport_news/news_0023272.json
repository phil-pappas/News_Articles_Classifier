(Photo: Rob Gray-USA TODAY Sports) \nEnquirer University of Cincinnati football beat reporter Tom Groeschen breaks down the Bearcats' football game Friday night at BYU: \nCincinnati (3-2) at BYU (4-2) \nFriday, 8 p.m., LaVell Edwards Stadium (Provo, Utah) \nTV/Radio: ESPN/WLW-AM (700) UC making rare trip West to face BYU \nWhen UC runs \nMike Boone, UC's most explosive back at 9.6 yards per carry, is expected back this week from an ankle injury. Hosey Williams (80 yards, TD) and Tion Green (90 yards) stepped up in the 34-23 upset of the Miami Hurricanes on Oct. 1. Boone brings the three-man committee back up to speed, giving UC an extra gear and keeping Williams and Green from overwork. \nWhen UC passes \nQB Hayden Moore threw for 279 yards and two TDs in the win over Miami (Fla.) . Usual starter Gunner Kiel (neck) has been medically cleared, but coach Tommy Tuberville will not name a starter before game time . Wideouts Johnny Holton and Chris Moore are expected back from injuries. Slot receiver Shaq Washington (34 catches) remains the most reliable option. \nWhen BYU runs \nBig running backs Algernon Brown (6-1, 235) and Francis Bernard (6-0, 235) have totaled 328 rushing yards and five total TDs in the last two games, for 5.4 yards per carry. BYU has averaged 170.5 rushing yards per game in its last two games, up from 103.8 in the four previous games. For UC, linebacker Eric Wilson is by far the top tackler (53 stops). \nWhen BYU passes \nQB Tanner Mangum (hamstring) is considered probable. Mangum has three 300-yard passing games, a BYU freshman record. Mangum also has led three game-winning drives in the fourth quarter. Another true freshman, Highlands (Ky.) grad Beau Hoge, backs up Mangum. Mitch Mathews, Nick Kurtz and Terenn Houk have a combined 66 catches and seven TDs. \nSpecial teams \nUC highlights from the Miami game included a career long 51-yard FG by Andrew Gantz and career long 69-yard punt return by Shaq Washington. Gantz is 12-for-14 on FGs and has hit 52 straight PAT kicks. BYU kicker Trevor Samson is No. 1 in school history for career FG conversion rate (84.0 percent) and has made 45 straight PAT kicks. \nGresh's Gameplan: 3 keys to victory \nWin the turnover ratio \nIt has become a broken record for UC, but it bears repeating. The Bearcats are tied for 116th nationally in turnovers lost (15). BYU is tied for 14th in turnovers gained (13). UC did not force any turnovers in upsetting Miami Oct. 1, but the Bearcats turned it over only once themselves. A step in the right direction, perhaps. \nKeep the foot on the gas \nThe Bearcats have no trouble moving the ball, ranking No. 5 nationally in total offense and No. 16 in scoring offense. BYU stands No. 63 and No. 79, respectively, in those categories, but that is somewhat misleading. The Cougars totaled 75 points in their last two games, wins over UConn and East Carolina. UC should be ready for a Wild West shootout. \nHandle the atmosphere \nUC is downplaying the altitude factor, with Provo sitting at high elevation (4,549 feet). The Bearcats have practiced hard to prepare for the thin air, including the preseason heat of Higher Ground camp. UC also must handle the noise of LaVell Edwards Stadium, with silent snap counts in the playbook. \nNumber of note \n4 â€“ In all four of its wins this year, BYU has trailed or been tied in the fourth quarter. \nPrediction \nBYU 37, Cincinnati 34 \nThe underdog Bearcats have the offensive firepower to compete with the Cougars, but what about the other side? The UC defense, playing with as many as six freshmen (true or redshirt) at a time, held potent Miami to three points in the second half of a 34-23 win Oct. 1. It may be a reach to expect that again, on the road against another national program. \nTEAM AVERAGES \nPF, PA, TotO, RushO, PassO, TotD, RushD, PassD \nUC: 39.0, 30.6, 587.2, 201.4, 385.8, 397.4, 167.4, 230.0 \nBYU: 27.7, 26.3, 408.2, 126.0, 282.2, 400.7, 155.8, 244.8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:48:27.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
