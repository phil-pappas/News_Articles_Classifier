It happens with the other federations in other countries, they really help. \n\"Porto, who played last night, played on Friday so they got permission to move their game which keeps them fresh.\" \nRodgers thinks the week-to-week competitiveness of the Premier League, plus a packed fixture calendar, works against sides when it comes to taking on continental opponents. \n\"The intensity, the way it is played, the demands on the players - in other countries some of the big teams in European leagues can change five, six or seven players and still win the game and put out a really strong team for the next game,\" he added. \n\"It doesn't happen in this country. The physicality of the Premier League is like no other \n\"I think big teams abroad can win games at 70 per cent and conserve their energy - there is no game in the Premier League where you can do that. \n\"They (European clubs) have a domestic competition less to cope with as well; we have two domestic cup competitions in this country where the others have one. \n\"It all adds up to physically being difficult for Premier League teams. \n\"It is something we have to cope with and we respect that challenge but it means you really have to monitor and get the best out of the players you have available.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:43:00.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
