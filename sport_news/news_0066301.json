Leonard, Fournette, LSU, RB: When 150 rushing yards feels like an off day, you know you’re talking about an amazing talent. \n2. Christian McCaffrey, Stanford , RB/KR: Another week and another huge all-around game for the sophomore. McCaffrey has 669 all-purpose yards in Stanford’s last two games. \n3. Trevone Boykin , TCU , QB: His team was off, but he’s still in the thick of the race. Boykin averages 426 yards of total offense a game. \n4. Derrick Henry, Alabama, RB: He’s been overshadowed a little by Fournette but had another good game rumbling for 143 yards and two TDs to give him 14 touchdowns for the season. \n5. Ezekiel Elliott , Ohio State, RB: Dalvin Cook wasn’t a huge factor while FSU lost so the Buckeyes star moves past him, going for 142 yards on the ground with another 29 receiving. Elliott’s eclipsed the 100-yard mark in every game and has 13 rushing TDs. \nBruce Feldman is a senior college football reporter and columnist for FOXSports.com and FS1.
