AP In coastal Maine, working on boats is a revered profession. Mainers have a deep and abiding respect for the ocean, as many of their families have earned a living on the water for centuries.\nRelated Links Crew position on sunken cargo ship El Faro was Dylan Meklin’s first job out of college New England captain of sunken cargo ship ‘the most competent of captains’ Here’s what’s so rare about the El Faro’s sinking Four of the crew members aboard the doomed cargo ship El Faro , which sank near the Bahamas during Hurricane Joaquin, called Maine home. The U.S. Coast Guard found no survivors, and the only evidence that anyone had made it off the ship came in the form of a crushed lifeboat and human remains found in an immersion suit.\nJeffrey Thompson, a poetry professor at the University of Maine, once described Maine as “a medium-sized city spread out over an entire state.” That interconnectedness means that when a tragedy like this occurs, the whole state feels it.\n“When something like this happens, it’s devastating to those very small communities because they have intimacy,” said Captain Joseph Murphy, a professor at the Marine Transportation Department at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, from which two of the crew members graduated.\n“They know what the circumstances were,” he continued. “They can guess at what happened. And in many cases, they know the people.”\nUnlike other global industries, the shipping industry is relatively small. Jobs aboard ships like the El Faro require highly specialized crew, many of whom attend the same elite maritime academies.\n“The people who attend those schools, they’re very familiar with each other,” Murphy said. “They’ve sailed with each other and shared a common challenege. It unites them all.”\nMany of the mariners’ families got word from their loved ones aboard the ship as the storm began to pick up— some received emails . But once the ship lost power, before it began to list to 15 degrees in the 140 mile-per-hour winds and 50-foot-high seas, none of them were heard from again.\nDuring the search period, Murphy said, the families “feel helpless because there isn’t anything that they personally can do to improve the situation.”\nMurphy is no stranger to this sense of powerlessness. His son Shane was the chief mate on the Maersk Alabama , a ship captured by Somali pirates in 2009. You may know it from the movie Captain Phillips , based on the true story.\nThere’s a feeling of trepidation that sets in as soon as seafaring families hear something bad has happened, Murphy said. Questions swirl: Will the person I love on that ship be alright? Will they survive?\n“And then of course, the understanding sets in that you’re really helpless to assist them in any way,” Murphy said. “The only thing you can do is pray for them—that’s it.”\nIn the case of El Faro , however, professional mariners knew that there wasn’t a high chance anyone would survive the minute they heard the ship had sunk. Given the circumstances, the maritime community didn’t hold out much hope.\n“Every minute after the first several hours, you know that their plight was even worse,” said Murphy. “You know it, but you don’t want to acknowledge it. Unfortunately, we were correct.”\nWhile the loss hits the families hardest, it ripples out from there to merchant marine schools, coastal communities, and the ships the lost crew worked on. It impacts professional mariners scattered around the world.\n“It goes global,” said Brendan McAvoy, chief mate on a training vessel at Maine Maritime Academy, four of the El Faro crew’s alma mater. “Seafarers are by nature an international lot, so what we suffer under an American flag is a pain and a hurt for the entire maritime community.”\nMcAvoy spent this past week at a conference in Pennsylvania concerning maritime education and training that was planned before the El Faro disaster occured. He said that the sunken ship was the undercurrent of all the meetings and presentations he attended, and that the mariners who died, their families, and their greater communities were on everyone’s mind.\n“We know this disaster is new, and it’s raw,” he said. “It’s very real.”\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement The prison debate team that beat Harvard only meets for two hours a week 10.09.15 | 3:31 PM The Donald Trump show is coming to Tyngsborough 10.09.15 | 3:19 PM Drones used during response to Vermont’s Amtrak derailment 10.09.15 | 3:13 PM No shortage of Massachusetts pumpkins after ‘ideal growing year,’ crop experts say 10.09.15 | 2:59 PM DraftKings ads have taken over the MBTA, too 10.09.15 | 2:21 PM Crimes dropped in Mass. in 2014 10.09.15 | 2:03 PM Everett man arrested for plotting murder-for-hire 10.09.15 | 12:37 PM The search is on for El Faro’s data recorder 10.09.15 | 12:28 PM Video: Elizabeth Warren says famed Mass Pike billboard inspired gun control push 10.09.15 | 11:37 AM The Lawn on D is turning into a giant pumpkin patch 10.09.15 | 9:04 AM 2 hospitalized from carbon monoxide at Newton school 10.09.15 | 8:57 AM Local company’s new MS treatment shows promising trial results 10.09.15 | 8:46 AM Mother gives birth in most Massachusetts place possible 10.09.15 | 8:15 AM Find out what’s on Boston’s transit wish list 10.09.15 | 7:21 AM Advocates see station design as a Green Line extension compromise 10.09.15 | 6:08 AM At Williams College, a giant stuffed bear keeps getting (bear)napped by rivals 10.09.15 | 6:06 AM Vermont ski resort says it will host World Cup race in 2016 10.09.15 | 12:33 AM Watch this drone scribble on a canvas at HUBweek 10.08.15 | 9:00 PM Dorchester man indicted on manslaughter charge in teen bicyclist’s death 10.08.15 | 8:32 PM Larry Lessig, Harvard law professor, says he’s scraping to get by as presidential candidate 10.08.15 | 7:26 PM Anatomical body painting at HUBweek event shows body’s structure and movement 10.08.15 | 6:22 PM Fitchburg man believes possible shark run-in saved his life 10.08.15 | 6:13 PM Red Line service has resumed between JFK/UMass and North Quincy stations 10.08.15 | 5:43 PM Heavy advertising push drew attention to scandal-plagued DraftKings 10.08.15 | 5:09 PM Man stabbed near Park Street Station 10.08.15 | 4:49 PM Chism juror could face penalties after talking about murdered teacher case 10.08.15 | 4:10 PM Massachusetts dumpling restaurants face off in federal court 10.08.15 | 2:55 PM Scenes from 2015 HUBweek 10.08.15 | 2:53 PM Man flies from San Francisco to Boston with 100 pounds of marijuana in his luggage, police say 10.08.15 | 2:15 PM Mayor Marty Walsh will head a national substance abuse task force 10.08.15 | 2:13 PM", "external_links": ["http://p.o0bc.com/rf/image_700w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/10/09/Boston.com/BCOM/Images/9f1b45c824fd4bfe981d6c6e283ef6b3-422faae222cb45f590a5f74369979373-0.jpg", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/05/daughters-last-message-from-el-faro-there-is-a-hurricane-out-here-and-we-are-heading-straight-into-it/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:24:46.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
