A 68-yard run by Tyus Flakes set up the game-winning score. \n“We’ve been through a lot of adversity this year,” Auburn head coach Adam Winegarden said. “We’ve been there supporting our kids through all of it. I’m just proud for them for showing so much fight tonight.” \nWinegarden said Fuller’s performance on the final drive was indicative of his work in practice. \n“Fuller played some last year and has some experience,” Winegarden said. “He’s done a good job preparing, and it took a lot of guts to complete that 2-minute drill.” \nPrattville (5-3, 2-3 Class 7A, Region 2) looked to have sealed the game when Austin Wilson intercepted Fuller at the Auburn 36 with 4:35 left and a 17-14 lead. \nLions senior running back Kingston Davis, who finished with 127 yards and a touchdown on 31 carries, was stopped short on fourth-and-1 on the Auburn 27 with 2:30 left. \nPrattville head coach Chad Anderson said he elected to go for it because he thought trying a field goal wouldn’t help. \n“A first down would’ve allowed us to run some more clock,” Anderson said. “We wanted them to use their timeouts, so that was the call we made. We left a lot of points on the field tonight.” \nThe Lions jumped out to a 10-0 lead, but three turnovers kept the Tigers (4-4, 3-2) close. Derek Gappa’s fumble with less than a minute to go ended the Lions’ final drive. \nMoore completed 12 of 18 passes for 114 yards and rushed for another 99 yards and a touchdown on seven carries. Wide receiver DeKeith Whatley caught six passes for 64 yards. \nDavis, one of 29 seniors who played their final home game on Friday, has now rushed for 1,320 yards this season. \nLions senior linebacker Dytarious Johnson had 11 tackles. Jamal Taylor added 10 and Braxton James had eight. \nAuburn got some help from the football gods on its first-half scoring drive. \nFuller fumbled near the goal line, but running back Cobi Smith picked it up and scored from 2 yards out with 1:27 left before halftime to make it a 10-7 game. \nFlakes finished with 76 yards on six carries for the Auburn. Linebacker TreShun Floyd had 11 tackles, and cornerback Damon Freeman finished with nine. \nAuburn will play at Smiths Station next Friday while Prattville faces a must-win game with Robert E. Lee. \n“This game was just as important as the Lee game will be,” Anderson said. “We have got a lot of issues we need to correct. We have to do a better job at execution.” Buy Photo Prattville quarterback Josh Moore carries against Auburn in Prattville, Ala. on Friday October 16, 2015.
