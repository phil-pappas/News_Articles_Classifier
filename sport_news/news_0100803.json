I think they still have a point to prove after their initial performance (against Japan). They will be disappointed with their start, but they have grown into the tournament and you can't discount them.\" \nWales failed to capitalise on the scoreboard when Australia had two players - Will Genia and Dean Mumm - sin-binned, and Jones added: \"We were held up (over the line) three times. \n\"We should have capitalised when they were down to 13 men, but we didn't, and you have got to move on. \n\"When you are a man down, it goes very slowly, and when you are a man up it goes very quickly. \n\"We didn't capitalise, probably through a fault of ours, and that we didn't finish it is credit to them (Australia) and their resolute defence as well. \n\"When we look at it, I think it will be pretty obvious what went wrong. We didn't make any rash decisions, but we didn't score.\" \nThe Wales players awoke at their Surrey base on Sunday to fresh injury news, with Scarlets back Liam Williams having succumbed to a foot problem and being ruled out of the tournament remainder. \nBut they must quickly put that latest setback behind them - Williams has joined Leigh Halfpenny, Rhys Webb, Scott Williams, Hallam Amos and Cory Allen in suffering a tournament-ending injury - and regroup for South Africa's challenge. \nWales beat South Africa when the countries last met 11 months ago, and Jones' second-row partner Luke Charteris added: \"I think our defence was the difference that day. \n\"When you look back, whenever we have a big win our defence has usually been a massive part of that. That was the pleasing thing from yesterday that our defence was really good to hold an Australia team to no tries. \n\"You have got to go into every game thinking you can win. You are coming into a quarter-final of a World Cup, and it is going to be a massive game whoever you play. \n\"They are very fine margins at the top of the game. We have to make sure those fine margins go our way.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:56:53.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
