Organizations have different timelines to meet the new standard, Minister Irvin-Ross noted. Government has one year, public-sector bodies two years and private and non-profit organizations three years, she said.\n\"People with disabilities have an estimated buying power of about $40 million each year in Canada,\" said Lanny McInnes, Retail Council of Canada. \"Improving accessibility is not only the right thing to do, it’s also the smart thing to do.\"\nThe new rules emanate from the government’s 2013 Accessibility for Manitobans Act. The act requires the development of accessibility standards in five areas including customer service, employment, information and communication, transportation and the built environment. The customer service accessibility standard is the first of the five standards to be developed.\nMore information on the Accessibility for Manitobans Act and the new standard is available at www.AccessibilityMB.ca .\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:47:24.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
