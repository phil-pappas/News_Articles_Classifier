Even as the people await “achhe din” with respect to roads, the minister seems to be operating on the “work-in-progress” mode. With the Centre, which has a major stake in the construction and maintenance of national highways in the state, taking its own time in speeding up road projects, the minister finds himself in a difficult situation to provide a smooth ride to commuters. The minister and his party BJP, which came to power on the promise of smooth connectivity to state’s hinterland, are pinning hopes on the Centre as the state has a high concentration of national highways and a major part of the state falls in the National Capital Region (NCR). On his part, the minister can take solace in the Centre’s announcement of road projects worth Rs 25,000 crore in the state. The projects include eight new national highways — Bhiwani-Mundhal-Jind-Meerut, Hisar-Adampur-Mansa-Bathinda, Jind-Safidon-Panipat, Titram Mod Kaithal-Hisar-Rajgarh Rajasthan border, Pehowa-Kurukshetra-Yamunanagar, Khangesra-Kala Amb, Yamunanagar-Paonta Sahib, and Ambala-Saha-Shahbad. The discrimination in the road construction works plagued the Hooda regime. Rao Narbir inherited the legacy of ‘discrimination’ and is trying hard to dispel the notion of favouritism with the aim of “sabka saath, sabka vikas”. Perhaps with that end in mind, the minister initiated the Rs 1,560-crore plan for road re-carpeting under which a lion’s share of Rs 1,346 crore would go to the re-carpeting of the “other district roads” linking remote areas of the state in this financial year. On the flip side, the minister can take credit for the re-start of the work on the ambitious Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway and the Sonepat-Ghaziabad-Palwal Expressway, foundation stone of which will be laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:17:40.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
