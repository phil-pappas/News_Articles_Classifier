If there’s grass on them or if they’re a bit roughed up, they’ll have to be flexible.” \nMcDermott added that every bowler had to be flexible in Test cricket. \n“You can get a really good red ball that swings a lot or one that quickly goes out of shape, the wicket’s dry and you’re trying to go reverse within 25-30 overs,” he said. \n“It’s really going to depend on the conditions. The conditions are going to drive how they bowl with the pink balls.” \nCricket Australian remain confident the Test will be a success, having produced a million-dollar carrot to convince players on either side of the Tasman. \nJohnson suggested last week that it wasn’t ideal for the Test squad to be playing a pink-ball match before two red-ball Tests, especially after the postponed tour of Bangladesh. \nMcDermott expected Johnson and his fellow pacemen would find their groove in Brisbane before the first Test starts on November 5. \n“There’s not a major issue going from one ball to the other. Certainly the guys transition between white and red balls very quickly and easily,” he said. \n“Your lines and lengths don’t really change.” \nJohnson, Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle all rolled the arm over under the watchful eye of McDermott during a red-ball training camp earlier this month. \n“They all bowled very, very well,” he said. \n“They certainly bowled well enough to be playing Test cricket, that’s for sure.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:50:06.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
