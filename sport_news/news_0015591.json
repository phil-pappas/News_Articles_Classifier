The Whalers, 6-0 overall and in the Mayflower Athletic Conference Small, used strong offense and defense in beating the Wildcats (5-1, 4-1 MAC Small) for the second time in as many years, clinching their second straight league title. “We’re really becoming a team,” Ryder said. Ryder’s charges continued to come together, holding the Wildcats (5-1, 4-1 MAC Small) out of the endzone in the second half, with sophomore Alex Small recovering a West Bridgewater fumble late in the second half to stall a drive. Senior linebacker Norman Ramsey and junior captain Cory Ryder, at tackle, led the Nantucket defense with six tackles each, while Ramsey also added a tackle. The offensive line also stepped up for the Whalers, led by Ryder and his 6-4, 265 pound frame, along with sophomore Nick Correia and his 6-3, 340 pound frame, holding off West Bridgewater’s defense. The work of the offensive line allowed Small to lead a strong Nantucket ground game, as the sophomore ran for 150 yards on 10 carries. Small also had one of the Whalers’ two touchdowns, rumbling 70-yards to tie the game at 6-all in the second quarter. Senior Akeem Henry’s point-after-touchdown kick gave Nantucket a 7-6 edge at the half, a lead the defense would not relinquish. Junior Keenan Phillips added 87 yards on the ground on 19 carries, bursting 7-yards for the Whalers’ second score, this one in the third quarter. Henry’s second PAT of the day made it 14-6 as the defense held off West Bridgewater down the stretch for the win.
