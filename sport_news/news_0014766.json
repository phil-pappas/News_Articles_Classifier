But the Indians’ Ashley Evans (19:43) won the title.\nCourtney Brunet (20:21), Kristen Travers (20:57), Nicole Brougher (21:08) and Mary Scrivanich (21:16) finished second through fifth to lead the Golden Knights.\n“We knew we needed separation in the middle mile, and going around the lake, places two through six were pretty tight,” coach Jeff Clark said. “But we did what we needed to do and ran well collectively. [Winner Ashley] Evans of Passaic Valley was a standout performer of this race, though.”\n \n \nTenafly used its experience at Garret Mountain to its advantage as it raced to the boys National Division championship.\nCoach Dave Burns saw last week’s meet with NV/Old Tappan and Bergenfield as a tuneup for the league meet, which Tenafly won by just one point over second-place NV/Demarest, 33 to 34.\nDespite a bloody nose before the race, Max Zavidow was able to lead Tenafly, finishing second in 16:37.\n“I told Max, ‘If you don’t feel good enough, get second,’ and it was great that he was able to do that because our goal was the team title,” Burns said.\nSeniors Michael Silverman (17:24), Frank Maloney (17:25) and Ed Salaski (17:31) were the next three up for Tenafly, finishing sixth, seventh and eighth respectively.\nJames Weissenborn of NV/Old Tappan won the National Division race in 16:19.\nIndian Hills edged Ridgewood in the boys’ Freedom Division Championship, 29 to 34.\nThe Braves’ confident bunch was led by Matt Cohane, who raced to a second-place finish (16:25). Teammate Steven Fiumefreddo (16:31) took third. Chris Corcoran (16:44), Derek Barney (16:49), Thomas Holster (16:53) and Chris Leymeister (17:04) finished seventh through 10th for Indian Hills.\nBilly Byrne of Ridgewood edged Cohane (16:24) to win the race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:35:00.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
