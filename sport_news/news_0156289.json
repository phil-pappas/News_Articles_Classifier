(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) MARCIO JOSE SANCHEZ â€” AP \nThe shoulder injury that Randall Cobb suffered during the preseason is still bothering him, but the former University of Kentucky star still managed five catches for 44 yards in the Green Bay Packers' 17-3 win at San Francisco on Sunday. \n\"It's the warrior mentality,\" Cobb said afterward. \"I'm going to go out there and give everything I can to my teammates.\" \nCobb appeared to re-injure his shoulder on a play during the second quarter. Although he missed a couple of plays at the end of the half, he said that he wouldn't have returned to the game if he wasn't OK. \n\"Obviously, I'm in pain,\" Cobb said. \"But sometimes you've got to play through pain. It's not an injury, it's pain. ... You've got to know the difference between pain and injury.\" \nPackers Coach Mike McCarthy appreciated that Cobb was able to play through the pain. \"He's definitely a warrior and a champion.\" \nThe 49ers used second-year safety Jimmie Ward to guard Cobb in nickel situations. \n\"I really loved the way he played the game,\" Cobb said. \"He's a very physical player. He made it tough for me, especially with having limitations with my shoulder.\" \nThrough four games, Cobb has 25 catches for 289 yards and four touchdowns for the undefeated Packers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:05:48.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
