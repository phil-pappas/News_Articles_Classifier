The meet took place at Iowa State’s Cross Country course and was hosted by Roland-Story. \nJessen, Thomson and Moody all ended up on the all-conference medal stand with top-14 performances, and the Class 2A No. 11 Raiders finished with 81 points. Class 3A No. 2 Gilbert won the title with 25 points and 2A No. 10 North Polk was the runner-up with 36. \n“We were really happy with the all-conference honors, and two of those girls are freshmen,” Meinerts said. “We just wanted to make it through today and not have any serious injuries. We can give some of the girls some time off. Hopefully, we’ll have everyone healthy by (Oct. 22).” \nPrairie City-Monroe was kept off the all-conference stand but finished in fourth with 131 points. Nevada rounded out the top five with 153, while the rest of the field included Roland-Story (173), Greene County (184), Saydel (186) and South Hamilton (240). \nThe ultimate goal for both the Raiders and Mustangs is to be at their very best when they run in the state qualifier meets on Oct. 22. \nRatliff was not at her best Monday as she continues to fight through shin splints. PCM likely won’t have Rachel Stafford the rest of the year and Kiara Kappelman continues to sit out with an injury. \n“It will be nice having a week and 1/2 before our district/regional meet so we can get over some of these little nagging injuries,” Meinerts said. \nCMB’s Jessen crossed the line in eighth place, finishing with a time of 22 minutes, 2.90 seconds. Thomson was 12th in 22:18.59 and Moody was less than a second behind in 13th. Ratliff wound up 23rd, and the final counting place was senior Chasity Moody in 30th. \n“I was hoping to place and help our team do well,” Jessen said. “This will give me some confidence heading into regionals.” \nThe other two varsity runners were junior Winter Brown in 43rd and junior Anna Jones in 50th. \n“I am happy with third,” Meinerts said. “Chasity ran a good race. She continues to get better at each meet and is running really well right now. Winter and Anna rounded out our varsity and competed well with the girls around them.” \nJayci Vos led the Mustangs, but she finished two spots shy of an all-conference honor. The junior placed 16th with a time of 22:39.56. Freshman Payton Schut was two spots behind in 18th with a time of 22:46.45. \nSophomore Baylee Smith was next for the Mustangs in 28th, while freshman Megan Townley placed 36th and freshman Sara Dudley was the final counting place in 51st. Senior Morgan Novak and freshman Morgan Uhlenhopp also competed, crossing in 69th and 72nd, respectively. \nGilbert claimed the top three spots and six of the first 11 with junior Carley Rahn winning in 20:46.70. North Polk finished 4-5-6-7 in second. \nPCM runs in the Saydel Invitational at 5 p.m. Thursday. The Mustangs and Raiders both compete in a 2A state qualifier on Oct. 22. PCM travels to Waterloo Columbus, while CMB heads to Dike-New Hartford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:50:32.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
