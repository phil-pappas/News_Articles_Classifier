Liberty quarterback Doug Erney has helped the Hurricanes start the season 5-1 and is one of several players who have emerged as a player of the year candidate. (DONNA FISHER / THE MORNING CALL) Keith Groller Contact Reporter Several big football games remain in the regular season \nSometime in late November or early December, my colleagues Stephen Miller and Jeff Schuler and I will discuss The Morning Call's all-area high school football selections for this season. \nAs if that discussion isn't difficult enough, we'll also talk about player-, coach- and team-of-the-year selections. \nThank goodness that meeting isn't happening this week, because with four games left in the regular season, the races for the top awards are as muddled as the battles for District 11 playoff positions. \nSeveral big games remain in the regular season, not to mention the postseason, to help us sort these things out. \nAmong those huge contests remaining are the ones listed in the Best of the Bunch section attached to this column as well as these potential season-makers: \nOct. 23: Bethlehem Catholic at Stroudsburg, Freedom at Parkland, Easton at Liberty and Southern Lehigh at Northern Lehigh \nOct: 30: Easton at Freedom, Parkland at Nazareth and Notre Dame at Saucon Valley \nOct. 31: Liberty at Central Catholic \nNov. 6: Nazareth at Easton, Emmaus at Parkland, Salisbury at Southern Lehigh, Northern Lehigh at Palmerton, Jim Thorpe at Lehighton \nNov. 7: Liberty at Freedom, Central Catholic at Bethlehem Catholic \nAnd then, of course, we're guaranteed at least three weeks of playoffs to take us through Thanksgiving weekend and probably a weekend or two in December before all of the mud-stained cleats are stored away. \nMaybe if we're lucky, we'll get a team to Hershey that last weekend before Christmas (Dec. 18-19) for a state championship game. \nPlayer of the Year : This was billed as the year of the quarterback, and that preseason assessment hasn't been off the mark. Liberty's Doug Erney, Parkland's Devante Cross, Notre Dame's Tre Jordan, Whitehall's Gianni Sinatore, Nazareth's Travis Stefanik and Bethlehem Catholic's Julian Spigner are just a few who have been truly impressive, not only in the air but on the ground. \nBut the running backs still have made their mark. \nSaucon Valley's Evan Culver, Northwestern's Harry Hall, Easton's Nysir Minney-Gratz, Stroudsburg's Jamaal Brome, Becahi's Antwon Keenan and Emmaus' Kyle Boney, among others, have been putting up big numbers on the ground. \nErney got a lot of help in Friday's big win over Parkland, but if Liberty ends up winning the EPC South and District 11 4A titles, you can bet he'll have a lot to do with it and will get vast player of the year consideration. Ditto for Cross at Parkland. \nAnd if Notre Dame wins 2A and Becahi wins 3A, guys like Jordan, Spigner and Keenan will get strong consideration. Same for Culver if Saucon breaks through in 3A. \nCoach of the Year: This generally goes to a coach who has engineered a major turnaround. And maybe that's a little unfair to people like Parkland's Jim Morgans, Easton's Steve Shiffert and Southern Lehigh's John Toman, who consistently have their teams at the top and never seem to be in rebuilding mode. \nBut this year, a couple of guys have clearly stood out. In the EPC South, you have to start with Central's John Cupples and Nazareth's Tom Falzone, who have made their teams relevant again after dismal 2014 seasons. \nFreedom's Jason Roeder was last year's Morning Call coach of the year, and normally, we don't have repeat winners. However, at this point of the season, Roeder still has to be considered because he has the only unbeaten EPC team left even with the injury to Roberto Diez. \nIn the EPC North, Stroudsburg's Jim Miller and Becahi's Joe Henrich have done well to keep their teams going forward after disappointing opening nights. \nIn the Colonial League, Notre Dame's Chuck Muller is the clear front-runner. I don't know if it's ever happened that a team went from 0-10 to 10-0, but it's a possibility with these Crusaders. And there's no doubt that Muller's assistant head coach, former Pius X mentor Phil Stambaugh, would deserve to share the award if it lands in Green Pond. \nAs for the just-outside-the-Valley entries, Lehighton's Tom McCarroll continues to do a stellar job with the unbeaten Tribe. If his team somehow emerges as the 3A district champ, his stock will rise. \nA couple of exits down the Turnpike, Quakertown's George Banas has his team undefeated. It was just three years that this was a 1-10 program. Banas has stayed the course. \nTeam of the year: The teams that are 6-0 top the list, but to me, the most amazing story to this point is the one unfolding at Notre Dame. \nWe'll see if the Crusaders can keep it going over the remainder of the regular season and into the playoffs, but everyone loves a rags-to-riches story tinged with sadness. When you mix in the tear-filled closing of Pius X and how Stambaugh and several of his players had to find a new home, this one has all the elements of a storybook season. \nIt'll be fun to see how the final chapters unfold. \nEPC SOUTH \nTeam, Division, Overall, PF, PA \nFreedom, 4-0, 6-0, 221, 69 \nEaston, 3-1, 5-1, 266, 67 \nLiberty, 3-1, 5-1, 247, 149 \nParkland, 3-1, 5-1, 253, 116 \nCentral Catholic, 3-2, 4-2, 179, 143 \nNazareth, 3-2, 4-2, 208, 210 \nEmmaus, 1-4, 2-4, 186, 200 \nWhitehall, 0-4, 2-4, 141, 207 \nNorthampton, 0-5, 1-5, 83, 194 \nEPC NORTH \nTeam, Division, Overall, PF, PA \nSTANDINGS \nTeam, Div, All, PF, PA \nBecahi, 5-0, 5-1, 264, 79 \nStroudsburg, 5-0, 5-1, 261, 129 \nPleasant Valley, 3-1, 3-3, 193, 190 \nES North, 2-3, 2-4, 141, 147 \nPM East, 2-3, 2-4, 88, 176 \nDieruff, 1-3, 1-5, 64, 223 \nES South, 1-3, 1-5, 111, 271 \nPM West, 1-3, 1-5, 108, 252 \nAllen, 0-4, 0-6, 57, 249 \nCOLONIAL LEAGUE \nNotre Dame, 6-0, 247, 99 \nSaucon Valley, 6-0, 265, 93 \nSouthern Lehigh, 5-1, 237, 82 \nNorthern Lehigh, 4-2, 187, 99 \nNorthwestern, 4-2, 186, 85", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:37:45.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
