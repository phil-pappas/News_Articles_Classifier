Everybody did their job and did it well, which was nice.” \nParkland (19-0) never appeared in danger of losing a set, building a large lead to start the competition before setter Kristin Krause scored the decisive point in the opening segment. \nSenior opposite hitter Siena Salvaggio ’s bombardment late in the second set pushed the Trojans to a comfortable 25-13 win. Classmate Erika Foose headlined a 10-4 stretch in which the defending champs took control of the third frame before Webber closed the victory out. \nFoose paced Parkland with 13 kills; Salvaggio added 12; and Webber tallied nine along with a career-high seven blocks. \n“She’s very versatile in the type of balls she can hit from the middle and with her range,” Mike Krause said of Foose. “She has very good vision, so she can see what they’re giving her and she has the control of the ball to put it in the openings.” \nVIDEO : Parkland girls volleyball’s Erika Foose excited for EPC title, districts ahead \nWhile Parkland executed in the championship game, things went the opposite direction for Liberty (19-2). \n“Parkland has no holes. They don’t have a weakness,” Hurricanes coach Missy Lynn said. “We have to play our best volleyball to compete with them, and we didn’t play our best volleyball.” \nEvery time Liberty, ranked second in the area by lehighvalleylive, built the slightest hint of momentum, an errant serve or misplaced pass would undo the rhythm. \n“Too many unforced errors, mental mistakes, a lot of intimidation, I think,” Lynn said. “We’re just not used to being at this stage.” \nThe Liberty coach indicated that playing the defending PIAA Class AAA champions for a trophy seemed to be too much for the Hurricanes, who have never been in a similar situation. \n“I think a lot of it just had to do with their anxiety (and) not being used to this,” she said. “Parkland is such a huge name. They’re two-time state champs. I think the girls just needed to believe in themselves and as soon as we got down, that belief went away.” \nMeanwhile, The Trojans continue to operate with a machinelike efficiency, despite the target that their past success and No. 1 ranking in the state might bring. \n“We try to focus on playing,” Mike Krause said. \nWinning conference titles – six times over – takes care of itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:17:42.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
