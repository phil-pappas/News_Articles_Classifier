On Saturday, the Falcons (4-3, 4-2 NE-10) defeated American International , 10-6, in Waltham. Senior linebacker Matt McDermott (Central Catholic) recorded two sacks and junior safety Sam McDonald (Norfolk/King Philip) had a late interception. Since allowing 41 points to Merrimack on Sept, 26, the Falcons defense has surrendered a total of 33.\n“Early on in the season we were doing just enough to get overmatched and not enough to come out on top. The last few weeks, we’ve been doing just enough to find a way to win,” Bentley coach Bill Kavanaugh said. “Our kids always play tough but lately we’ve been limiting our mistakes and found a way to grind out some wins.”\nSaturday should clear up some of the clutter. Bentley travels to archrival Stonehill (4-3, 3-3), which has struggled of late. Also, league leader Assumption (6-1, 5-1) visits AIC (3-4, 3-3). The Greyhounds, off to their best start since 1994, outgunned Southern Connecticut , 60-50, in New Haven, with the teams combining for 60 first downs (36 by the Owls) and 1,134 yards of total offense (623).\nAssumption backs James Ward (184 yards, TD) and Alex Shain (124 yards, three TDs) were dominating on the ground, while Deonte Harris caught seven passes for 111 yards and two scores. Jarrod Casey of Milford (17 tackles), Andrew Benson (14) of East Bridgewater and Charlie Reid (two interceptions) led the defense.\n“There is no off week in this league,” Kavanaugh said. “You have to show up every single week and give it your best. It’s really a credit to the league. It’s a well-coached league and the kids go out and fight. That’s why it’s so tight.”\nNeeds some kick\nStruggling UMass (1-5, 0-2 Mid-American Conference) may be disheartened but the Minutemen are far from throwing in the towel in the wake of Saturday’s 15-10 loss to Kent State at McGuirk Stadium. Kent State punter Anthony Melchiori was the unsung hero, booting fourth-quarter kicks that were downed at the UMass 1 (10:42 left), 9 (8:07), and 2 (4:38).\n“The ball just didn’t bounce our way. We were out of sync on offense. Their punter did a pretty good job of pinning us inside the 10 three times. Two games and we were one play away. But, the kids are playing hard. It’s a good group. It’s all about staying together,” coach Mark Whipple said. “If we can make a couple of plays, I think we can be a good football team.”\nBlake Frohnapfel (17-of-33, 171 yards, interception) became the fourth quarterback in UMass history to reach 5,000 passing yards. He joins leader (and current quarterbacks coach) Liam Coen (11,031 from 2004-08), Todd Blanchard (7,018 from 1998-99), and Dave Palazzi (5,461 from 1985-88). Frohnapfel has 5,139 passing yards.\nSenior Tajae Sharpe caught seven passes for 46 yards and passed Adrian Zullo to become the school’s career leader in receiving yardage with 2,905. The seven receptions increased Sharpe’s mark for career receptions to 231 while extending his consecutive games streak with at least one catch to 41, the third-longest active streak in Division 1. Defensively, linebackers Jovan Santos-Knox and Shane Huber finished with 17 and 10 tackles, respectively.\nNice start\nKudos to Bowdoin freshman quarterback Noah Nelson, who threw for 328 yards and four touchdowns in his first start to help hand new coach J.B. Wells his first win with the Polar Bears, 30-20, against Hamilton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:46:09.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
