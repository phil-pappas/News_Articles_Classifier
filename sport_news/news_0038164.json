There was no immediate comment from Kabul.\nPakistan hosted a landmark set of meetings between the two sides in July. But a second round of scheduled talks was postponed after the Afghan government revealed that Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar had been dead for two years.\nSince then the Taliban briefly overran the northern Afghan city of Kunduz in an embarrassing blow to President Ashraf Ghani's government. Kabul has also accused Pakistan of playing both sides by sheltering Taliban leaders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:52:26.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
