I felt pressure the last year I was at Callaway when I had the best team in the state. I want to win. I hate to lose and I hate to be around a loser,” Brent said after his team’s practice on Thursday morning. “Pressure is on me from me. I’m not used to losing, I don’t want to lose, I don’t want to be associated with people who lose. I want to win. I want to win every time I hit the court. That’s what I’ve been accustomed to.” \nBrent has won 11 games in each of his two seasons. The Tigers allowed 63.5 points per game last season, which was the top scoring defense in the SWAC. But JSU shot just 38 percent from the field and 27 percent from beyond the arc, which hurt the scoring output. \nThe top four scorers from last season are back. With newcomers, such as guards Paris Collins and Haudrick Hilaire, in the mix now, Brent hopes the combo of veterans and new guys can help pick up the scoring this season, which tips off in a little more than a month. \n“I’m looking for newcomers to pick up some of the scoring slack. We led the conference in defense, but we were probably last in scoring. So I’m looking for Paris and Haudrick to give us a boost on the offensive end … so the older guys, I’m looking for them to increase their scoring load (too).” \nThe Tigers officially started camp last Friday, and most of the players are entering their junior year now. \nOlder players, such as point guard Yettra Specks, Raeford Worsham, who led the team in scoring with 13.5 points per game last season, and Treshawn Bolden have taken on more vocal leadership roles. \nThere are 11 juniors on the roster, so the players should be a bit further along, which is a good thing for Brent. \n“We started from scratch (here),” he said. “To see where we are today compared to where we were two years ago, it makes it exciting to get up when that alarm goes off at 5 o’clock in the morning to know that I got somebody that looks like what I wanted the first year when I got here.” \nNotes \nBrent said he saw some good signs from guard Chace Franklin, who he expects to help fix some of last season’s scoring issues … Franklin was hurt recently, though, and will have an MRI on his knee on Wednesday, according to Brent … Iowa Western guard Deshawn Munson, who committed to JSU earlier this year, is still finishing up some junior college class work and is expected to enroll in school in January. 2 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1LkT1u1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:03:57.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
