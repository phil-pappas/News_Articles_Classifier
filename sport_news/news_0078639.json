(LiPo Ching/Staff file photo) SAN JOSE -- San Jose's two newest golf courses are likely to remain money-losers for years to come, according to a new city audit that cited their high debt costs and the game's fading popularity and suggested selling all or part of one or turning some links into soccer, softball or baseball fields. \nSan Jose built the two courses, Rancho del Pueblo and Los Lagos, early last decade amid bullish predictions about the sport's growth. But they've never earned enough to cover operating and debt costs, draining more than $2 million from the city each year to subsidize them. \nThe audit, which the City Council will consider next month, is renewing cries at City Hall to explore other options. \n\"We have these courses open, but very few people play in them and we can't be subsidizing them forever,\" said Councilman Tam Nguyen, whose district includes the money-losing Los Lagos course, which opened in 2002. \nBut the city's golf courses also have their defenders who argue they provide affordable access to the sport. \nLongtime golfer Bill Hubka, 76, said losing some of the city's links would drive golfers to play out of town and will hurt numerous local tournament groups. \n\"I think that is a real loss for the city and a tremendous step backward,\" Hubka said. \"Golf was very popular many years ago; now it's not as popular, but it doesn't mean it won't be popular again.\" Advertisement \nThe audit shows the city subsidized its golf courses with $2.2 million last year, to cover operating losses and debt. That number is expected to reach $2.6 million this year. The city owns three courses: Los Lagos, Rancho del Pueblo and San Jose Municipal Golf Course. But only San Jose Muni, which opened in 1968 and has no remaining debt costs, is making money -- about $400,000 a year -- for the city. \nThe other two have seen revenues drop dramatically as golf play decreased by 28 percent at the 180-acre, 18-hole Los Lagos, and 42 percent for Rancho del Pueblo, which has nine holes spanning 31 acres. \nBoth golf courses are losing about $300,000 a year, and face a mountain of debt -- $18.3 million for Los Lagos and $4.5 million for Rancho del Pueblo. \nThat means City Hall is going to have to make some tough decisions about the future of its public golf courses. The auditor's report outlines a few choices: The city could sell a portion of the golf course lands to pay off their debt, reconfigure the land for a soccer, softball or baseball fields, or keep all three courses open and try to reduce annual losses by boosting usage. \nBut Los Lagos would need to grow usage by 60 percent and Rancho by 140 percent to fully cover operating losses and debt service, the report said. \nThat seems unlikely given the competition from at least 23 other golf courses within 25 miles of downtown San Jose and a nationwide decline in golf play, the auditor said. \nThat's why Councilman Nguyen supports eliminating one. He said converting part of the land into a soccer, softball or baseball field satisfies a growing need for more sports fields, though the report says it would require one-time conversion costs. \n\"We must make good use of the land to accommodate more people,\" Nguyen said. \"It's better to have more people benefit from the land instead of so few people.\" \nCouncilman Donald Rocha, whose children are involved with softball, soccer and other youth sports, said there's a shortage of fields and complexes for games. But he's not convinced the embattled golf courses are the right spots. He said Rancho del Pueblo would be \"my last choice\" for field conversion. \n\"I'm very reluctant to give up on this particular golf course if we haven't done our due diligence to look at other sites,\" Rocha said. \nThis isn't the first time San Jose has tried to rid itself of the money-bleeding golf courses. A 2011 effort to sell part of Rancho del Pueblo and build condos was met with sharp criticism, public outcry and an ugly political fight. But if the city chooses to close a golf course this time around, the auditor suggests a community engagement process. \nClosing Rancho del Pueblo, which has half the number of golfers as Los Lagos on any day, would damage a nonprofit that aims to teach youth healthy habits through golf. The First Tee of Silicon Valley served 1,030 youth last year through the program, and nearly 77 percent of the kids were taught to play at Rancho del Pueblo. The organization contributed $50,000 in revenue to the golf course, according to Executive Director George Maxe. \nMaxe was one of dozens of people that flooded a Parks and Recreation Commission meeting Wednesday to speak on the audit. The commission voted 7-1 to accept the report, but will send a letter to the City Council opposing closing the golf courses and asking for other solutions. Commissioner Virginia Thomas was the lone dissenter. \n\"If they closed Rancho, we would not be able to move the program to Los Lagos because it does not have a layout that's safe for young people,\" Maxe said Thursday. \"We would continue our program but the question is will San Jose's youth travel to other cities? My guess is they wouldn't.\" \nCouncilwoman Magdalena Carrasco, whose district includes Rancho del Pueblo, said she'll oppose a plan to close it, especially to build retail or office space. But if the community wants to convert the course into a baseball or soccer field, she'll support it. \n\"Where I would draw the line,\" Carrasco said, \"is developing it into anything other than open space.\" \nFollow Ramona Giwargis at Twitter.com/ramonagiwargis or contact her at 408-920-5705.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:10:19.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
