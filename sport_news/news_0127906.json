(Photo: Emerald McIntyre/ULM Photo Services) 71 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTodd Berry admitted he’s worried about what’s left of ULM’s season following another loss. \nWorrying comes natural in coaching, even when things are going well. And when they aren’t? That’s when the job security questions and calls for a change start. \n“I think everyone sitting in our situation is worried. But if you’re 5-1 instead of 1-5 you’re also worried about how long you can keep it going,” Berry said. “We have a big ball game this week and they’re all big at this point.” \nULM’s 59-14 loss to Appalachian State on Saturday was its worst at home since moving to the FBS level in 1994. The few fans that did make it to the game showed their displeasure by leaving at halftime. \nBy the time the fourth quarter started, the stands at Malone Stadium were as empty as they’ve been since the darkest days of the Bobby Keasler era. \nULM athletic director Brian Wickstrom understands the growing frustration among the fan base, but he isn’t ready to give up on Berry or the season at this point. \n“I’m not an advocate of making a coaching change midseason unless there’s an extenuating circumstance,” Wickstrom said. “It’s too early to give up on the season with seven games left. \n“What Todd and his staff did back in 2012 totally raised the bar for expectations in the program. When you have the bar raised that’s going to lead to more disappointment with how the season has gone and that’s understandable.” \nWickstrom has never hired a football coach on his own, but was part of Mike Alden’s staff at the University of Missouri that hired Gary Pinkel. UC Riverside, where Wickstrom was the athletic director for three years prior to ULM, doesn’t have football. \nIn 2012, Berry led ULM to a surprise 8-5 season and Independence Bowl berth, both firsts for the program at the FBS level. Since that time the Warhawks have regressed each year, first to 6-6 in 2013 and last season to 4-8. \nBerry has one year remaining on a contract extension he received after the 2012 season. \nFollowing the Appalachian State loss — the fourth-in-a-row this season — Berry channeled his frustrations toward ULM’s schedule. The Warhawks routinely play two or three guarantee “money games” per-year against opponents from power conferences to offset a lack of funding both institutionally and from private donations. \nOne of Wickstrom’s goals since becoming athletic director in 2013 was to reduce the number of “money games” and offset the loss in revenue with increased ticket sales. ULM played at Alabama and Georgia this season after going to LSU, Kentucky and Texas A&M in 2014. \n“If we can grow our attendance we can become less dependent on playing guarantee games, but winning helps attendance,” Wickstrom said. \n“There’s still a lot of football left and they’re all winnable games. Over half of our season is still to be played and that’s something everyone needs to keep in mind.” \nULM starts a three-game road stretch this week at Idaho. Trips to UL Lafayette and Troy takes the Warhawks into November and back to Malone Stadium to play Arkansas State on November 14. \nULM closes the regular season at Texas State on Thursday, November 19 on ESPNU, at Hawaii Thanksgiving weekend and back in Monroe for the final home game of the year with New Mexico State on December 5. \n“They say if you’re made of the right stuff then a big fall results in a big bounce,” Berry said. \n“What we need is a big bounce.” \nFollow Adam on Twitter @adam_hunsucker 71 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1RSuNbH TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:15:27.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
