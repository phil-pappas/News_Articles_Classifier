The Colonels would move to 2-0 in league play with a 48-17 victory over the Golden Eagles. The game was moved off campus because of a security threat, but Coney showed no effects of the adversity, tying a school record with five touchdown passes while throwing for 351 yards. \nThe redshirt junior from Plant City, Florida led EKU on scoring drives on each of its first seven possessions. Coney completed 21-of-29 passes for 257 yards and four touchdowns in the first half, including a 70-yard scoring pass on the third play of the game. \nConey’s five touchdown passes are the most by an OVC quarterback against a NCAA FCS or FBS team this season. \nThe Colonels will try to remain unbeaten in the OVC when they play at Southeast Missouri on Saturday. It will be EKU’s first conference road game of the season. Kickoff is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:26:50.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
