(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) KANSAS CITY, MO (FOOTBALLKC) - \nThe 2-2 Minnesota Vikings are by no means one of the league’s best, but following a home loss to one of the NFL’s worst teams, the Kansas City Chiefs will settle for any win they can take. \nIt won’t be an easy task, as Kansas City has to travel up north and start without Jamaal Charles for the first time this year. Filling the All-Pro’s shoes on Sunday will be the young duo of Knile Davis and Charcandrick West. \nEver since week one’s Houston game, both sides of the ball have had serious issues for the Chiefs. \nOn offense, Alex Smith has regressed from last year despite having newly acquired Jeremy Maclin. Smith has already thrown half of the interceptions he threw all of last year, and hasn’t been able to produce in red zone situations. \nPart of that struggle is due to the offensive line play, as the group has had almost a new starting five every week. Eric Fisher has not improved over the off-season and Ben Grubbs hasn’t been the force on the left side the Chiefs were hoping for. \nThe Vikings defense ranks around the middle of the pack as far as top NFL defenses go, so the Chiefs should be able to move the ball with some success. If Smith can develop a steady rhythm early, Davis and West should have more holes open up to help fill Charles’ production. \nThe bigger question mark for Sunday comes defensively, as the Vikings have a solid overall attack, but what Chiefs defense will show up? \nAt times this year the Kansas City defense has shown signs of the being the top tier squad they were predicted to be. For the most part though, they’ve been consistently outplayed. Week’s two through four were against top quarterbacks, but week five’s loss to the injury plagued Bears came with no excuse. \nThe defense started strong against Chicago but failed to make any mid-game adjustments, and Cutler torched them in the end. The best defense’s ramp things up at the end of the game, and coordinator Bob Sutton has failed to do so this year. \nTeams have started to figure out how to beat the Kansas City defense, through quick passes to slow down the pass rush, attacking the nickel in the slot, and forcing the corners to make open field tackles. Sutton knows this, and by week five there needs to be new adjustments made to keep the offense on their heels. \nIt’ll be tough to pull off as the Vikings have one of the game’s best physical rushers, Adrian Peterson. Teddy Bridgewater has had a strong second year under center, and continues to connect with number one wide receiver Mike Wallace. \nThe Vikings line is beatable, so the key on defense must be to constantly pressure the turnover prone Bridgewater. If they can succeed there along with wrapping up Peterson in the open field, the Kansas City defense should give the offense a good chance to win. \nKickoff from Minnesota is set for noon on KCTV5. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
