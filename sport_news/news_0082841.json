The Frenchman was looking for an upset, to prove that he is back after dealing with a back injury. \nBoth players in red and black -- Djokovic at the top of your screen breaks in the opening game -- after the Frenchman can't get the volley over the net. The 16th seed would continue to make costly errors, that loose forehand goes long, and Djoker earns another break and a 3-love lead. \nTrailing 5-1 in the opener, Tsonga shows some fight with a punishing forehand winner. But that only prolongs the inevitable as the Serb takes the next game at love, to claim the first set 6-2. The second set is a far tighter affair with Tsonga limiting his errors -- and looking more confident from the baseline as he whips this forehand cross court for a winner -- and would go in front 4-3. \nBut in the ninth game, Djokovic would find an opening, from the baseline the World Number One would unleash a wicked forehand winner -- as he would get a vital break. Djokovic then serves for the match, and clinches the game at love, when the Frenchman's return goes long. The Serb takes it 6-2, 6-4 for his ninth title of the year. \nDjokovic then writes a Chinese character on camera -- that means happiness. The title is his 25th Masters success in all, and he's now 10-0 in ATP World Tour Finals in China, with this his third Shanghai triumph.
