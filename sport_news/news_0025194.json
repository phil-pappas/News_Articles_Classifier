On defense he had three solo tackles and two assists from his linebacker position. \nHILLSDALE - \"We were all really excited for this game,\" Old Tappan senior quarterback Kevin Martinez said Oct. 16, after his No. 1 ranked Golden Knights routed the No. 2 Indians, 42-14. \"We wanted this one bad, especially after what happened last year. We wanted some revenge and I think we did our job.\" \nWhat happened last years was that Pascack Valley beat Old Tappan during the regular season and then again in the North 1, Group 4 playoffs. Coming into this game the two teams were each 5-0. Buy this photo danielle parhizkaran/Staff photographer Golden Knights defensive back Austin Brackenbury, No. 10, breaks up a pass intended for Valley receiver Joe Coalsuano. Brackenbury led Old Tappan with eight solo tackles and one assist. \n\"We prepared all week,\" said Martinez. \"We had a great week of practice and watched a lot of film. We were ready. We weren't really nervous. We were ready for everything they had.\" \n\"Our kids were ready to play,\" added Old Tappan coach Brian Dunn. \"I give them credit for coming out and doing the things they had to do during the week to get ready.\" Buy this photo danielle parhizkaran/Staff photographer Jordan Fuller escapes the grasp of a Pascack Valley defender to pick up a first down. Fuller caught two passes, threw two touchdown passes, rushed for 34 yards and a TD and scored on a 'Pick-6' for Old Tappan. \nTAKING CONTROL \nThe Knights set the tone early by scoring touchdowns in each of their first four offensive possessions. Buy this photo danielle parhizkaran/Staff photographer Old Tappan running back Zach DeNike is stopped by a trio of Indians defenders. DeNike rushed for 119 yards, caught four passes for 63 yards and a touchdown and intercepted a pass. \nOld Tappan took the opening kickoff 60 yards on 11 plays to grab a 7-0 lead. Along the way Martinez hooked up with senior Jordan Fuller for a 12-yard gain and first down at the Indians 23. Senior Zach DeNike gained 21 yards on five carries but he saved his best play for last. \nOn a 3rd-and-goal from the 4-yard line, Fuller lofted a pass toward the right side of the goal line. DeNike reached up with one hand, pulled the ball into his chest and wrapped his arms around the ball as he fell into the end zone. \n\"He did a great job all the way around,\" Dunn said of DeNike's performance in the game. \"The kid ran the ball, had a couple of huge receptions. He made an unbelievable catch in the end zone.\" \nSenior Yanni Mitropoulos booted the first of his six PAT's to give Old Tappan a 7-0 lead. \nValley tied the game a little more than two and a half minutes later. \nTwo pass plays and two running plays set the Indians up with a first down near midfield. Knights defensive back Joe Alsharif saved a touchdown by making a great ankle tackle on Indians senior running back Jake Giambona, who had turned the corner with a clear path to the end zone. \nBut Giambona was held to a 3-yard gain by Alsharif's play. \nOn the next play, however, there was a mixup in the Knights' defensive backfield and senior quarterback Colin Dedrick found tight end junior Philip Wong wide open and Wong ran untouched for 46 yards and a touchdown. Junior kicker Matt Urrea tied the game with the extra point. \nThe first play after the ensuing kickoff Martinez and Fuller combined for a 31-yard gain, as Fuller made an over-the-shoulder catch down the right sideline. Five plays later Fuller broke it outside and scored on a 2-yard run around left end to make it 14-7. \n'A BIG-TIME PLAY' \nJust when it looked like the game might be a contest where the teams would go back and forth scoring touchdowns, Fuller intercepted a third-down pass and took it to the house from 49 yards out. \n\"I dropped back and he ran a really good route,\" said Fuller. \"I just happened to jump it. I had great blocking. It was a complete wall of white jerseys in front of me. It was awesome.\" \n\"[It was a] great run,\" said Dunn. \"We got great blocks, sealed the whole side. We had a wall just leading him in. That was a big-time play. He undercut the route and did a great job. We're lucky to have him, lucky to coach him. You don't get many kids like that.\" \nThe Knights led 21-7 and their defense was poised to put the game out of reach. \nValley moved the ball inside the Old Tappan 40-yard line on back-to-back pass completions by Dedrick. First, he hit senior wide-out Connor Jones for 29 yards and then he connected with senior Joe Colasuano for 18 more.
