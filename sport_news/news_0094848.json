(AP) - Decisions by the Hattiesburg City Council could mean a multimillion-dollar economic development impact over the next few years.\nThe Hattiesburg American reports ( http://hatne.ws/1PDvciR ) the council is being asked to not only approve the parameters that would create a planned solar farm, but also for any similar \"green energy\" projects in the future.\nCouncil also is also being asked to transfer documents of agreement from one paper product company already operating in the city to an international company looking to add to its North American footprint.\nIf green-lighted by council and approved by the Public Service Commission, construction on the $90 million project at the proposed 460-acre site is expected to start in February and be in operation before the end of 2016.\nInformation from: The Hattiesburg American, http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
