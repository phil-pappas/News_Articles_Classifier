They feel pretty good about that, manager Terry Collins said. And maybe they should.\nIn Game 1, deGrom threw seven shutout innings and struck out 13 Dodgers in L.A.\n\"Well, there's a reason why we thought, 'Hey, look, if we're up 2-1 in Game 4 that we're going to save him because he's the guy we want on the mound,'\" Collins said.\n\"I mean, we'll have a whole host of guys in the bullpen behind him. But you know, he's had regular rest, so that's a good sign. That's good for him. And you kind of feel real confident that he's pitched well out there that he's going to go out and do it again. And once again, this is a time when you need your guys to step up and you certainly think he'll do that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:06:00.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
