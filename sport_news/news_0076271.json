NATI HARNIK — Associated Press \nUW tight end Troy Fumagalli holds onto a scoring pass from Joel Stave after beating Nebraska safety Byerson Cockrell in the end zone Saturday. \nLINCOLN, Neb. — It has become apparent to one and all that this University of Wisconsin football team is not the one we’ve watched for years. \nThese Badgers are struggling to move the ball on the ground. They’re throwing it all over the yard. They couldn’t even run up a pinball score on Nebraska, for crying out loud. \nBut for all the things UW has seemingly forgotten how to do this season, there is one vital trait the Badgers still possess: They know how to win. \nThat is a special talent, one players and teams and programs learn over time. And despite the coaching transition from Bret Bielema to Gary Andersen to Paul Chryst that has left UW with shortages in experience and depth, the Badgers still expect to win and, when it comes down to crunch time, they can still get it done. \nThey showed that Saturday in what essentially was a Big Ten Conference elimination game. With their offense sputtering for three quarters, their defense uncharacteristically giving up big plays, their once-automatic kicker missing field goals, the lead flipping back in the fourth quarter and — oh, by the way — their season hanging in the balance, the Badgers somehow kept themselves together and made enough plays to escape Memorial Stadium with an often-ugly yet ultimately satisfying 23-21 victory over Nebraska. \n“I thought guys just kept playing,” said Chryst, in his first year as UW’s head coach. “It was one of those games. We always talk about giving yourself a chance to have a chance and I thought there were a ton of individuals that it didn’t all go their way, but they kept playing and their teammates kept believing in them and kept them going. ... Those sequences at the end, guys just kept playing and kept believing in each other. We had to make plays and enough plays were made.” \nEven at the end, when Rafael Gaglianone’s second-chance field goal slipped through just inside the upright, UW had no margin for error. Nebraska had been UW’s private punching bag in the schools’ four meetings since the Cornhuskers joined the Big Ten, with the Badgers averaging 51 points a game while winning three of the four. But with a shade over 16 minutes to play Saturday, UW’s troubled offense had scored seven points and the Badgers trailed the Cornhuskers by a touchdown. \nIt was then that UW’s survival instincts kicked in. After three quarters of unsightly football, quarterback Joel Stave and his receivers got on the same wavelength, tailback Dare Ogunbowale started ripping off sizable runs and the defense — save for one 55-yard touchdown run — made stop after stop against the dangerous Cornhuskers offense. \nThe most impressive part? UW never showed any signs of panic. \n“The fact that we have a lot of guys who have played in a lot of big games and a lot of close games like that, I think that helps a lot,” Stave said. “There was no panic on the sidelines from the offense or the defense. We have a lot of guys who have played a lot of football, so guys are confident. Guys believed that we would win.” \nIndeed, the Badgers had to keep their chins up at all times, which wasn’t easy because for the most part things weren’t going well. Their receivers had the dropsies for while. The running game yielded 58 yards through three quarters. Every time UW’s stellar defense had a hiccup, which wasn’t often, Nebraska scored a touchdown. And Gaglianone was only 2-for-4 on field goal attempts when he lined up for the game-winner with 9 seconds left. \nStill, UW never lost hope, never flinched, never quit. \n“I have faith in our team; I have faith in what our coaches are calling,” offensive tackle Tyler Marz said. “We did some good things. But we definitely need to get the run game going; that’s something that’s been consistent this year. But you’ve got to make do with what you’ve got at times.” \nThe Badgers did exactly that late in the game, overcoming injuries, blown chances and wild momentum swings. They twice marched down the field in the final 3 minutes, 38 seconds to set up a potential game-winning field goal. Gaglianone missed the first one, but the defense forced a three-and-out by Nebraska and the offense set up Gaglianone for another try, which he nailed. \n“It helps that guys have been in big games like this, to keep the young guys poised and keep them calm and be patient and don’t get the jitters or anything,” safety Michael Caputo said. “I think we did that today.” \nIf the Badgers hadn’t, the rest of the season would have taken on an entirely different look. A loss would have dropped UW to 0-2 in the Big Ten and put it two games (plus a tiebreaker) behind undefeated Iowa in the West Division. After rallying to beat Nebraska, however, UW is right back in the race. \n“We’ve got a resilient group of guys,” linebacker Vince Biegel said. “I think a game like this is something the younger guys can learn from, the older guys can continue to build confidence. It’s something that can push us and elevate us for the rest of the season.” \nEspecially if the Badgers remember how to run and score. We already know they haven’t forgotten how to fight and win. \nContact Tom Oates at toates@madison.com or 608-252-6172.
