Alec Cutler added a goal and two assists, and Ryan Lanning netted the other goal. \nThe top-seeded Crusaders were playing for the first time since a 5-0 win over Lansing in the Interscholastic Athletic Conference Large School final on Oct. 17 at Tompkins Cortland Community College. Notre Dame received a bye into the quarterfinals, while ninth-seeded Spencer-Van Etten was a 2-1 first-round winner over No. 8 Unatego. \n\"I don't think we played as well today as we did against Lansing last weekend,\" Cutler said. \"Definitely going to look to improve on that next time, and I think we have the potential to do really well this postseason. ... In the regular season, averaging nine goals puts a little pressure on you to perform, but I think if we play our game and do well, we just have to be happy with that performance.\" \nNotre Dame earned a home semifinal berth against fifth-seeded Trumansburg, which was a 1-0 overtime winner Saturday against fourth-seeded Tioga. The game will be played Wednesday, with a tentative start time of 3:30 p.m. The Crusaders were a 10-0 winner over Trumansburg during the regular season. \nThe Crusaders earned a 12-1 victory at Spencer-Van Etten in the second game of the regular season. Notre Dame had a 21-1 edge in shots on goal in Saturday's rematch, with that lone Panthers' shot their only serious scoring push. The margin on corner kicks was 11-0. Spencer-Van Etten goalie Jake Wentworth made 12 saves on a day in which the play was in front of him most of the time. \n\"Every time we step on the field, we're always trying to figure out ways to do things better so that opponents are less able to prepare for us,\" Notre Dame head coach Brian Adams said. \"Today was good because I got to move a lot of players around. I got game experience for some of the younger kids and did it in sectionals, so that makes it nice as well. \n\"I thought Spencer had a better effort definitely than they did against us in the first game. They've improved. But all in, 8-0 moving on and nobody hurt, that's the most important thing. We'll be back here on Wednesday.\" Buy Photo Spencer-Van Etten at Elmira Notre Dame in a Section 4 Class C boys soccer quarterfinal Oct. 24 at Brewer Memorial Stadium. Notre Dame won, 8-0.
