Which has allowed us to further explain all the depth and breadth of things that go on here. People are often surprised, and say, 'Wow. I didn't know that. I didn't know that happened at Augustana.' So it was a really good opportunity for us,\" President Rob Oliver said. \nIt could also help with recruitment. Students at Augustana have already been showing excitement about the big change, ever since the grand celebration on campus last month. \n\"Well they asked me on the first day of the semester. 'What do you think? What do you think?' And I asked them, well what do you think? Well I think that it's pretty cool,\" associate professor Joel Johnson said. \nJohnson has been at Augustana for a decade. He believes this big switch in names is a game changer for the school. \n\"We have more visibility. I think people who see us as Augustana University think of us as maybe a little bit higher status. Maybe a little bit more prominent than we otherwise would be,\" Johnson said. \n\"I think it could make a difference in terms of domestic recruitment as well, because there's a connotation that goes with college versus university,\" Oliver said. \nThat's not all that could benefit from the change. There are 150 international students on campus right now, from 38 different countries. \nInternational Program Director Donn Grinager says students around the world don't always understand the way U.S. schools are titled. \n\"In the UK and Hong Kong, there are a number of places where college gets used in place of secondary high schools. And so, for us to be able to go into those markets now as a university we don't have to spend any time explaining that the word college in the context of the U.S. is really the same as a university,\" Grinager said. \nSince the official announcement, the university has been busy getting the word out. \nSigns, business cards, radio ads and even billboards have been converted to let people know about Augustana's new name. All of that updating requires money, so we asked Oliver to share what it all cost? \n\"Well, I could if I knew but I don't even know. I mean, it's one of those figures that is part of and built into the marketing budget and then also part of the strategic planning activities,\" Oliver said. \nThough he didn't have exact figures, Oliver did say the university uses it's own printing shop for business cards and letterheads. They also have an internal team that does design work. \n\"For us to do that than what might originally appear, like wow that must have been really expensive. Well, there was some investment made, but it wasn't that terrifically expensive,\" Oliver said. \nDespite the money involved, faculty members seem excited to be part of something so historic for the institution. \n\"It's a big change. It's momentous. There's a lot of attention given to it. I think it's one of those moments where the college effectively gets re-founded,\" Johnson said. \n\"It's pretty exciting. Again, I think it has a real impact on the kind of work that we do in terms of the way that we recruit overseas. So for us in the international programs office, we're very excited,\" Grinager said. \n\"Well this is an important time for this institution, and it doesn't happen very often. The last name change, I believe, was in 1926. So yeah, so it's a big deal,\" Oliver said. \nNow, Oliver hopes they can keep the ball rolling and continue to spread the word about Augustana University. \nThe next big thing for Augustana is opening the new science building. The school will get partial access in February, and the facility will be fully operational by next Fall. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
