We looked past that in the first half,” Gautschi said. “They knew I was serious after half.” \nBut when Gautschi needed a spark, she turned to her best scorer and Claudia Lastra didn’t disappoint her coach. Gautschi said she doesn’t lack confidence in her player, it was just a matter of getting her player to buy into that. \n“It’s confidence for her,” Gautschi said. “I believe that you can do it, now it’s time for you to believe you can do it.” \nLastra had a hat trick of hat tricks. \nThat’s right, three hat tricks in one game: nine goals. On top of that, she had a hat trick in the first half. One in the second. A natural hat trick in the second quarter alone. It was a stat geek’s dream game. \nAnd Live Oak needed every one of her goals. \nIndependence wouldn’t go away quietly, despite the Acorns jumping out to a sizable lead after three quarters. \nThe Acorns also got big help from Jennifer Poonia in goal. \nShe made 10 saves, including a few at point blank range in the fourth quarter to keep Independence off the board. \n“She’s taken that job very seriously. I’m proud of the day she had,” Gautschi said. \nPoonia has never played goalie before and got in there because Gautschi said the girl had long arms and has acquitted herself nicely in the cage. \nThe 76ers actually led after the first quarter, thanks to a trio of goals in the later minutes of the frame. \nLive Oak had gone up early on a goal from Olivia Freitas, who finished with three for the game. \nAfter the 76ers answered, Lastra scored the first of her nine goals to retake the lead, 2-1. \nIn the second quarter, Lastra shined. \nAfter Taylor Bohn made the game 4-3, Lastra scored four consecutive goals to give Live Oak the lead for good. \nThe two teams went into the break with the Acorns leading 7-5. \nDuring the break, Gautschi challenged her team to step it up. And they answered. \nLastra had three goals. Freitas had two goals, Lecia Stover had a goal and Madison Blazzard had a goal. \n“I think Maddy played pretty well,” Gautschi said. “…She played better today than I’ve seen her play. Playing whole D is another job and it’s not fun.” \nLive Oak finished the whirlwind frame leading 14-8 over the 76ers. \n“They had to do it then if ever,” Gautschi said. \nBut the work wasn’t quite done. Independence scored four times in the fourth quarter to make the game closer, but the Acorns hung on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:33:02.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
