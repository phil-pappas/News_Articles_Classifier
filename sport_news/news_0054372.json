Take a drive down Courtenay Parkway and make a left onto East Merritt Avenue for the only other hardware, as Edgewood's Eduard Meighan was the top boy. \n\"Today, I didn't focus on the big picture,\" Meighan said. \"I just focused on one shot at a time, and I got a lot of good advice from my coaches and also my individual coach for a good set of skills to adapt to different lanes.\" \nThe Mustangs girls closed out Bayside -- both Bears teams took second -- by a 3-0 count in one final. Teams were divided into north and south divisions this year, and Merritt Island's girls had to come out of the consolation bracket from the north, squeaking by defending state champion Titusville to get to the last match. \nIrwin credited \"teamwork and spare shooting\" for the team win. \n\"Yes, it is an individual sport if you look at it technically,\" she said, \"but I think people underestimate the team side of it. Everybody likes hearing some encouragement.\" \nTheir day finished, the girls moved to watch the final boys game in the best-of-five series the Mustangs won over the Bayside boys, 3-2. \nBayside, strong all season, had to go two matches to advance past Melbourne in the south final. \n\"We had to wait for a good hour or more,\" Merritt Island's Austin Dillon said. \"I pretty much sat down, listened to music and got in my zone, focused on what we had to do.\" \nMeighan bowled games of 256, 225 and 237 for a 718 to top the boys scorers. Dillon (193-255-244-692) was next, followed by Chris Allan of Bayside (169-287-214--670). \nIrwin's three morning scores were 234-258-197 for a 689. She finished ahead of Crystal Elliott of Eau Gallie (181-248-225--654) and Rockledge's Danielle Koehler (237-169-200--606). \nLocals advance from regional golf \nBrevard County Class 2A boys golf teams were shut out Monday from earning spots at next week's state tournament, but two individuals from the area did advance. Rockledge's Joshua Campbell turned in a 77 at Walkabout Golf and Country Club in Mims, and he was joined by Eau Gallie sophomore Carter Stewart, who shot a 78 to earn his second state trip. \nCape Coast Conference bowling results \nBOYS \nTeams: 1.
