A pass from forward Matt Jennings was deflected off a Jr. Blues stick, but forward Quinn Preston settled the puck and snapped a shot into the net, giving the Runners an early lead. \nIt didn’t take long for Topeka to jump on Nappier in the second period. Just 25 seconds in, forward Cam Strong extended the RoadRunner lead with a power-play goal through a screen to make it 2-0. \nThe Jr. Blues luck didn’t get much better in the second half of the period. \nWhile shorthanded, Topeka found itself on a 2-on-0 breakaway, with Jennings beating Nappier glove side high for a 3-0 Runner lead. \nTopeka’s special teams played a decisive factor in the outcome, with three of the five goals scored while even on the power play or shorthanded. \n“When your special teams are on like that, your team has a chance to win every night,” Langer said. “Both penalty kill and power play have been areas we’ve been working on, because they haven’t been our strength, but tonight they were very good.” \nOn another odd-man break, Topeka extended its lead to four midway through the third period. At 6:07, Strong slammed home a good feed from forward Luka Maver. \nForward Yu Hikosaka sealed it late in the third period. With Springfield on a power play, Jr. Blues coach Tony Zasowski pulled Nappier to make it a 6-on-4 power play. It didn’t take long for Hikosaka to flutter the puck into the empty net, making it 5-0. \nThe two teams tangle again at 7:05 p.m. Saturday. The first 250 fans will receive a free coozie. \nSpringfield (6-3-1) 0 0 0 — 0 \nTopeka (7-6-0) 1 2 2 — 5 \nFirst period — 1. Topeka, Preston (Jennings), 7:53. \nSecond period — 2.
