Several of the area’s best players are juniors, including Princess Anne’s Alyssa Presto and Ocean Lakes’ Danielle Hart. There are also high expectations for a pair of incoming freshman: Jayna Francis (Princess Anne) and Gracie Johnson (Cox).\nSTATE TITLE HUNTING\nThe Princess Anne girls team has had its rough share of defeats through the years, whether in the former Beach District semifinals or in last season’s state final. Persistence usually pays and the Cavaliers should have two great chances at a Group 5A title the next two years as they’re led by a stellar junior class. Ocean Lakes also has a state runner-up finish in recent memory and the Dolphins are capable of a deep run.\n___\nTOP 10 TEAMS IN SOUTH HAMPTON ROADS\n1. Princess Anne\nComing within one point of winning the Group 5A state title was crushing, but the Cavaliers return revitalized. Gone is All-Tidewater Player of the Year Alex Toben, so expect a more diverse attack. Setter Alyssa Presto will build her offense around Abby Bottomley, Chika Osuchukwu, Ashley Burgess and Julia Rochester. But keep an eye on freshman Jayna Francis. Already 5-foot-11, Francis’ power may allow another hitter to fall back to a much-needed defensive hole left by All-Tidewater libero Margaret Latchford, now at Liberty. After that state final loss, coach Craig Dooren vowed to find that one missing point in the offseason. Weeks ahead of the new season, he said, “I sure hope we found it.”\n2. Ocean Lakes\nStanding at 6-4, junior middle Danielle Hart, is a sky-high presence. But the Dolphins aren’t a one-trick pony. Always well-rounded, they welcome back setter Alisi Motu’apuaka, outsides Liv Crawley and Taylor Allbritten, middle Lauren Zell, opposite LeeAnne Dean and libero Kelly Smith. “I am quite confident that when we hit on all cylinders it will be fun to watch,” coach Jack Wheeler said. To combat complacency, Wheeler has introduced new drills in practices, while players have been mixing up practice partners to break routine.\n3. Kellam\nTaking a backseat to First Colonial and Princess Anne may not be ideal for the proud program, but the Knights still hang around. All-Tidewater outside Reilly King graduated and the Knights will rely on returning role players who face the new pressure of starting minutes. Junior libero Savannah Marshall and sophomore middle Tori Morris are back. “Any given day, any one of many players could be the star,” co-head coach Janice Johnson said.\n4. Cox\nSenior outside Ashlee Jaworsky and senior setter Taylor Dunn hope to lead Cox to its potential. The Falcons have shown flashes the past couple years under coach Jason Zuidema, Cox’s longtime boys coach who pulls double duty. Freshman Gracie Johnson enters the fold and should see plenty of time to make an impression. Zuidema said Johnson is “easily the best freshman volleyball player to come through in a while.”\n5. First Colonial\nWinning the 6A title in a mind-numbing 25-23 fifth set is impossible to top. Nevertheless, the Patriots press on with senior outside Rowan Ennis. She is joined by sophomore setter Brie Severino, the only other returning starter. Seven seniors graduated, including former All-Tidewater Player of the Year Catie Espinoza. While the team’s return from volleyball’s summit may be a struggle early, don’t count out FC in the postseason.\n6. Nansemond-Suffolk\nThe defending VISAA Division II state champion lost five senior starters and the new crop will be looking up at the competition. No player stands taller than 5-8, so expect a different style from the Saints. Four juniors – hitters Livi Bono, Logan Harrell and Lindsay Knierbein and setter Nicole Wright – played club ball together and their chemistry is key to success.\n7. Grassfield\nThe Monitor-Merrimac Conference defending champion is led by St. Francis (Pa.) commit Cecelia Pisano, a senior libero/setter. The Grizzlies have long been a tough program under coach Robin Smith and this year should be no different. Clashes with Western Branch and new conference foe Granby should be great. Sophomores Jailee Johnson and Taylor Didawick will provide offense on the pins.\n8. Hickory\nLone returning starter Erin Parks, a senior outside, guides the Hawks into a rebuilding year. A traditional Chesapeake power, Hickory should remain competitive behind Parks and fellow seniors Maddie Hughley, who takes over setting duties, and outside Natalie Eaton.\n9. Salem\nExpect the SunDevils to contend following years of an also-ran moniker. Salem’s junior class is awash with club experience, led by 6-foot outside Quiana Griffin. “They’re coming back with a vengeance,” coach Kelly Mills said. Juniors Lindsey Taylor, Sammy Sabater, Anaya Ghacham and SaTyna Jamison join Griffin.\n10. Bayside\nWith senior libero Briana Kerr and sophomore middle Megan Sivertson, the Marlins are poised for a successful year, despite being in one of the state’s most brutal conferences. “Ninety-percent of our roster has club experience,” coach Butch Caldwell said.\n___\nFIVE PLAYERS TO KNOW\nAbby Bottomley, Princess Anne: “Abby is one of the best all-around players in the state,” coach Craig Dooren said.\nRowan Ennis, First Colonial: A fierce attacker, Ennis, committed to UC Santa Barbara, becomes the heart and soul of FC’s offense.\nDanielle Hart, Ocean Lakes: The skillful junior middle has already committed to Virginia Tech.\nAshlee Jaworsky, Cox: At 5-10, the outside hitter is the “offensive threat at the pin,” coach Jason Zuidema said.\nAlyssa Presto, Princess Anne: The junior has maintained status as one of the area’s best setters since starting freshman year.\n___\nELSEWHERE\nIn Group 6A ...\nGranby ’s lineup may include five sophomores, particularly Hannah Talliere and Megan Baxter.
