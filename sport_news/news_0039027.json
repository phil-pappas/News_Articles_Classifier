Improve every day. Get our minds right and get our bodies right for these last four games.” That final portion of the season starts to take effect next week, when Elon returns from the break to play at Stony Brook in a Colonial Athletic Association game. For now, the Phoenix (2-5 overall, 1-3 CAA) is treating its bye week as time to reassess and recalibrate after three straight losses to nationally ranked opponents in the Football Championship Subdivision, a string of defeats in which Skrosky said Elon, while facing tough competition, didn’t perform near its potential. “Especially when you’re coming off the three games we’re coming off of, the last few weeks have been difficult,” Skrosky said. “I think it’s an important week. I think it’ll say a lot about the character of our team. “These games we have left, we need to be competitive. We need to play our best and we need to prepare our best, so we’ve got to get re-energized and refocused.” Elon practiced Wednesday and will practice again today, then take Friday and Saturday off from practices. Earlier in the week, Elon had Monday off, per its usual routine, and gathered for a morning weightlifting session Tuesday before having the rest of the day free from practice. It has been a grind for the Phoenix, which has logged two and a half months filled with football since opening preseason training camp in early August. That Elon’s open date comes during the eighth week of the season is quite preferable, Skrosky said. “I think Week 7 or Week 8 is the best time to have it,” he said. Skrosky has worked to make it that way. Elon’s bye last year arrived quickly in early September, the week after its season opener. That was to be the schedule format again for this season, until Skrosky engineered change. “It was one of the biggest things I wanted to get fixed,” he said. Elon’s coaching staff is using this week for recruiting purposes, too. On Monday, assistant coaches traveled throughout the state and into South Carolina. They’ll head out again in a similar capacity Friday, with a few making stops Georgia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:44:10.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
