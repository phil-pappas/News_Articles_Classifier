Sundevils have a shot to get to 7-0. Volcano Vista @ Rio Rancho Coach David Howes and Co. know how to win big games. This one should be a thriller. Hope Christian @ Ruidoso Long trip from ABQ. but Hope survives Ruidoso. Expecting Caleb Meyer Hagen to have big night. Valencia @ Belen Battle for the Farm Plow - I think Coach John Lerma finds a way to win late in the game. Valley vs. Atrisco Heritage Who wants it more? Big rivalry game going down tonight. Thinking Aaron Bean busts a few long runs as the Jags move to 2-0 in district. Centennial @ Chaparral Lobos have come a long way, but Centennial is a team that is simply on another level. Deming @ Onate Knights win a must win game Friday Night against Deming. Onate could still shake things up in district. Miyamura @ Piedra Vista Piedra Vista continues to be the alpha in district. Wins by 10. Silver @ Hatch Valley Thought about taking Silver for a second... Hatch Valley however I think wins in a very tight contest. Sandia vs. Eldorado Eldorado does what they have been doing all year. Rollin'. Eagles win big. St. Pius X @ Lovington Sartans win big in Lovington, Drew Ortiz and Miles Hilton go off...
