(The) Developed world has committed itself $100 billion per year by 2020. It has to be paid by the developed world to developing nations,\" environment minister Prakash Javadekar told PTI here.\nJavadekar said French President Francois Hollande, who will be hosting the Climate Summit in Paris, has indicated that unless there is credible action from the developed nations with regard to implementation of GCF, the Paris talks may fail.\n\"Therefore, we are saying that unless there is credible action ... and even French Francois Hollande (the host of Paris summit) has said if there is no clear progress on Finance, Paris (talks) may fail. ... He has warned,\" Javadekar said.\nThe Green Climate Fund was set up under the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2010 and developed countries had committed to raising $100 billion each year by 2020 to help developing countries deal with climate change.\nFurther, dismissing any suggestions that India is moving away from its role in protecting interests of poor and vulnerable nations in world summits, the Union minister said India is always at the forefront to ask for climate justice \"which has caught up the imagination of the world, because it is a historical responsibility\".\nAsked whether the bloc of newly industrialized countries - Brazil, South Africa, India and China, formed to act on climate change, is still relevant in the changing global political scenario, Javadekar replied in affirmative.\n\"BASIC is relevant,\" he said.\n\"We had a very good meeting last year. I was the minister. India hosted the BASIC meeting. Then, now China is hosting. I am going there. We are part of all groupings plus some additional new friends. We have not walked out of it,\" he said as the nations prepare for the Conference of Parties (COP21).\nCOP21 is also known as the Paris climate conference, aiming to achieve a legally-binding and universal agreement on climate with the aim of keeping global warming below 2Â°C, and will take place from 30 November to 11 December, in Paris, France.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:26:32.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
