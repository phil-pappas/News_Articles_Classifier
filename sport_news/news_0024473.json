In the 2013 divisional round, the Pats rushed for 234.\nAll three games were decisive wins for the Pats, but the Colts have played better against the run this season, and are ninth in the league in yards allowed per attempt with 3.8. The previous two seasons the Colts were 22nd (4.3 in 2014) and 25th (4.5 in 2013).\nClearly, the Colts feel like they needed to address the weakness that Patriots exploited in keeping Indianapolis from making it to Super Bowl XLIX.\nOutside lineacker Trent Cole, signed by the Colts during the offseason after being cut by the Eagles in March, has been credited with part of that transformation. Known as one of the toughest players in the league, he has only posted 10 tackles, but has started all four games and made two run stuffs for negative yardage and another two hurries.\nPatriots tight end Rob Gronkowski sees a defense that doesn't exactly look soft anymore.\n\"They look solid,\" Gronkowski said. \"They're a very good team. They're physical and they come ready to play. They're physically and mentally prepared. They can tackle. They can make big hits. So we've just got to be ready.\"\nIt might be player-speak, but \"physical,\" and a team that can \"tackle\" and \"make big hits\" did not characterize the Colts' defense the last few years. Now at least the numbers seem to back it up.\nWhether or not this improved run defense reverses the Colts' fortunes against the Pats will be worth keeping an eye on Sunday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:54:11.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
