The Stockton Heat era begins against the Rockford IceHogs at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Stockton Arena. Friday was decision day for the franchise, as it finalized the roster and chose its captain and the rest of its leadership unit. Among those on the roster is longtime Stockton Thunder favorite Garet Hunt, who after a strong preseason has been signed to a regular-season player tryout contract (PTO) which is good for up to 25 games. The team also announced former Thunder goalie Kent Simpson made the squad, and veteran defenseman Aaron Johnson was named captain. Hunt, 27, played seven seasons with the Thunder and was its all-time leading scorer. The forward scored three points in two preseason games and was impressive in camp, earning himself more time with the Heat. “He impressed us during camp, so we wanted to see what he can continue to do,” Heat coach Ryan Huska said. Hunt owns a home in Stockton and amped up his offseason training program to try to earn a job with the new Triple-A team in the city. “I think it’s a great opportunity that the Calgary organization is giving me,” Hunt said. “I just have to wait for my opportunity to get in the lineup and when that time comes, I have to be ready.” The 28-player roster includes 18 forwards, eight defensemen and two goalies. An AHL team can activate 20 players (18 skaters and two goalies) for each game. Forward Ryan Culkin is a member of the Heat but is on the injury list. Huska said he was still determining which skaters will play Saturday, but announced that 6-foot-5 rookie goaltender Jon Gillies will be in the net. Gillies, 21, was a third-round NHL Draft pick by the Calgary Flames in 2012, and finished his collegiate career at Providence last year by leading the Friars to their first NCAA title as a junior. He was named the most valuable player of the Frozen Four. He will be backed up by Simpson, 23. He has AHL experience, including 34 appearances with Rockford (2011-14). The appointment of Johnson to the captaincy was expected. He has 291 games of NHL experience during his 13-year career, and last season served as the captain of the Binghamton Senators of the AHL. The alternate captains will be forwards Turner Elson, Garnet Hathaway and Blair Riley. “As you get older you are expected to bring more things to the organization,” said Johnson, 32, “It’s always something I’ve enjoyed doing, and it’s an honor.” Eleven members of the Heat have played in the NHL, and Johnson is one of five veterans being counted on to bring balance to a young lineup. Enforcer Colton Orr is likely the best known of the group, amassing 477 games in the NHL in 12 seasons and 643 professionally. The other vets are forwards Riley (359 pro games), Derek Grant (281) and defenseman Jakub Nakladal (329 in European leagues). The Heat also features several top-notch Calgary prospects, including forwards Emile Poirier, Markus Granlund, Bill Arnold, Hunter Smith and Morgan Klimchuk, and defensemen Oliver Kylington, Kenney Morrison and Tyler Wotherspoon. Huska feels the Heat is going into the season with a nice mixture of players and a team that will be competitive in the newly-established AHL Pacific Division. The first test is Saturday in front of what is likely to be a loud and curious crowd at Stockton Arena. “I think there is a lot of nervous energy that is around right now. Everybody is looking forward to getting started,” Huska said. “I think the guys are looking forward to (today), and playing the first game in front of a nice, big crowd here in Stockton.” — Contact reporter Scott Linesburgh at (209) 546-8281 or slinesburgh@recordnet.com.
