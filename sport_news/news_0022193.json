I was at a game between Toronto FC and Chicago Fire last week. It was a good game and the football has developed a lot since 20 years ago when I first watched a football game there,' the Israeli trainer said. \n'It's a friendly game but we couldn't get our full squad here due to various reasons. However, there are a lot of Ghanaian footballers around the world so am giving these players an opportunity to show their talent and to prove that they deserve a place in the national team', he added. \nAssistant coach of the Canadian national team Michael Findlay also praised the quality of footballers that Ghana possesses, adding that his side cannot afford to take the Black Stars for granted. \n'Ghana has high quality in their team and we know there are new players coming through with some who are based here in America. They have some key players injured but we can't take their team for granted.' \n'We have done our research on the team and we are aware of the competition Ghana will give us', Findlay said at the press briefing held at the Ghana Embassy in America. \nThe friendly match will kick off at 7:00pm local time (11:00pm GMT). \nCredit: Ghanafa.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:11:51.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
