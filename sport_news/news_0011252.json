She said she couldn't immediately say what they believe caused Odom to become unconscious.\nBut she acknowledged that medics usually turn someone on their side, as Odom was, to relieve pressure on the chest and help them breathe.\nThe sheriff didn't say whether Odom ever regained consciousness while he was stabilized and taken to hospitals.\nBrothel owner Dennis Hof said Odom arrived alone, was \"polite and reserved,\" drank alcohol from the bar and took herbal sexual enhancement capsules.\nHof said Odom didn't use drugs in the presence of anyone in the house.\n7 a.m.\nReality TV personality Khloe Kardashian has been by Lamar Odom's side at a Las Vegas hospital since Tuesday evening.\nThat's according to a person close to the Kardashians who spoke anonymously because she wasn't authorized to speak to the press. Kardashian and Odom were married in 2009, but Kardashian filed for divorce in 2013, citing irreconcilable differences.\nOdom was found unconscious Tuesday afternoon at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, about 70 miles outside of Las Vegas.\nAuthorities said the 35-year-old was stabilized at the scene before being taken to a hospital. He was then transferred to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas.\nOwner Dennis Hof said Odom had been at his brothel since Saturday.\nBy Associated Press writers Sally Ho and Ken Ritter.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
