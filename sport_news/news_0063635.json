How did he do? Good coach, but as a manager I didn't like certain things about how he dealt with Raheem. \n\"Fifty per cent of the players would probably tell you Brendan is not a good manager, but he is a good coach. \n\"Raheem could've stayed, he should be at Liverpool. I think for me it was like he was being told to be a good boy and sign a contract. \n\"In December I spoke to Liverpool and said we'll sign a contract if there is a buy-out clause - those clauses are now common practice. They said no to that. \n\"Then there were remarks. In press conferences, Brendan told everyone Raheem would sign - why do that? \n\"I knew, Brendan knew and Liverpool knew there was an issue. Right now he probably should be a Liverpool player, but he's not and he's in a great place at City.\" \nSterling appears to be a natural fit at top-of-the-table City, scoring five goals so far, including a hat-trick against Bournemouth on Saturday. \nOn the same day, Jurgen Klopp made his debut as Liverpool boss following Rodgers' sacking a fortnight earlier. \nWard is a big fan of the German and expresses a certain regret that Sterling did not get to play under him. \nHe said: \"The new Liverpool manager probably would have been a great fit for Raheem - passionate, disciplined in the right way, new ideas, not afraid of trying new things. He'll do great at Liverpool. \n\"He's going to get the best out of those players. It could have been a dream come true.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:12:27.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
