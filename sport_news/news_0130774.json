He said he was not worried about the injury, but he will spend the next few days rehabbing the injury.\nGiven Beckham's history of hamstring issues, expect the Giants to be very cautious. This will be a situation to monitor over the next few days heading into next Monday's game at the Eagles.\nPLUS : The good, bad and ugly from Giants' come-from-behind win over 49ers\n• WR Rueben Randle : Randle also left the game with a hamstring injury, and did not return. But he told reporters after the game it was just a tweak, and he was OK.\n• CB Trumaine McBride : McBride, who entered the game with a groin injury, left the game.\n• S Landon Collins : Briefly left the game after getting his wind knocked out of him.\n• LG Justin Pugh : Pugh tweaked his ankle on the final drive of the game, but said he will be fine.\n• LB Jon Beason : Beason left the game early with a concussion. He will now enter the league protocol. Beason missed the first two games of the season with a knee sprain.\n• S Brandon Meriweather : Meriweather sprained his knee, but returned to the game.\nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below.
