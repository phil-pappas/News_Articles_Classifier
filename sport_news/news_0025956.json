We have two freshmen and three sophomores starting, so we just had to grow into it, and that is what the difference is right now.” \nFor its effort this season, Newnan — in its first season under head coach Krista Wilson — still will get the opportunity to host a Class first-round playoff match as the No. 2 seed from 3- . Campbell and Douglas County finished third and fourth, respectively. \n“I am disappointed we did not win against our biggest rivals,” Wilson said. “I think they were just really ready for us. It’s been a good year and we are excited about going to state. I thought everybody played hard for us.” \nEast Coweta seniors Sydney Winters, Peyton Smith and Dominique Ingram led the team in the title match. Winters led the Lady Indians with 14 digs and 17 kills, while middle hitter Dominique Ingram had 16 kills. At setter, Smith led with 44 assists to go with 10 digs. \nJunior libero Riley Padgett led the defensive effort with 33 digs. \n“I think we played with more emotion this time,” Ingram said. \nFreshmen Becca Sieckmann and Isabel Moller chimed in with 10 and 7 digs, respectively. Sophomore Allie Edwards added three blocks. \n“We have some young players on this team, but I think we are getting better every day,” Smith said. \nNewnan took control of the first set in the championship round between the two schools jumping out to a 19-12 lead, but East Coweta rallied, outscoring the Lady Cougars 13-4 down the stretch. \nThe Lady Indians momentum carried over to the second set, building a 17-8 lead at one stretch before Newnan fought back to cut it 23-21. \nBut the Lady Indians were able to take the 2-0 lead after Padgett and Winters scored points down the stretch. \nNewnan senior Jenni Young helped put away several points, and Hailey Goolsby and Olivia Masonheimer helped keep points alive during the late scoring spurt. Libero Hallie Goolsby led the defensive effort while Callie Bass and Ansley Knight each had multiple blocks in the loss. \nThe Lady Indians jumped out early in the third set leading 14-7. \nLike it did in the second set, Newnan made another run, cutting East Coweta’s lead to 16-15 only to have the Lady Indians close out the sweep with a 9-3 run.
