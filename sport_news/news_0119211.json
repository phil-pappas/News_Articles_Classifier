It's evidently not so bad answering questions from a throng of media members after you help Alabama's defense outscoring the offense in a 41-23 win against No. 9 Texas A&M. \nIt's safe to assume Minkah Fitzpatrick had a little fun against the Aggies, too. The true freshman had two interception returns for touchdowns to lead the defense's 21-point performance. \n\"Offense wins games; defense wins championships,\" Jackson said. \"We wanted to come out and play fast and create turnovers.\" \nIt wasn't supposed to be fun, though. \nNot against a pass-heavy Aggies offense that featured three of the SEC's most dangerous receivers in Christian Kirk, Josh Reynolds and Ricky Seals-Jones. The Aggies run the spread, uptempo offense that has given Alabama trouble in the past, and Saturday was considered another major challenge for a young, but talented secondary. It'd be the toughest test yet for Fitzpatrick and redshirt freshman Marlon Humphrey. \nTexas A&M lived up to its reputation and threw the ball 45 times, but it was Alabama's secondary that won the day. Jackson, who looks better and better each game at safety, weaved and danced through Texas A&M for a 93-yard interception return for a touchdown. Jackson helped the Crimson Tide set a school record with three pick-sixes, besting a record set in 2008 by Javier Arenas and Justin Wollard. \nThe defensive touchdowns covered up for the offense's sputters and quieted the 105,733 in attendance at the new-look Kyle Field. \n\"When you play a quality football team like Alabama, your mistakes are amplified,\" said Texas A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin. \"Instead of balls just being on the ground, Alabama was returning them for touchdowns. You look at the game, that's 21 points right there.\" \nIt wasn't a perfect day for the secondary because there's no such thing. Aggies quarterback Kyle Allen threw the ball 40 times and connected on 20 of them -- a few for big gains. Seals-Jones finished with 107 yards and a touchdown, and all-star freshman Kirk had 90 yards on seven catches. There were a few defensive mishaps that let the Aggies hang around far longer than they should have. \nBut as linebacker Reggie Ragland put it, \"anytime the defense scores more than the offense, that's a great day for the defense.\" \nEven Alabama head coach Nick Saban was okay overlooking a few mistakes in light of the big picture achievements. \n\"First quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter I thought we did a really, really good job,\" Saban said. \"We got our second wind. Those guys have been playing pretty well back there for about three weeks in a row now. I know they had some yards today but when you throw it that much, that's what happens.\" \nThe defensive secondary more than handled its difficult assignment and helped Alabama defeat a tricky Texas A&M team for the third consecutive season. \nWith a performance worth smiling about, Alabama moved one step closer to surviving its October gauntlet.
