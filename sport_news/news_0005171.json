He could, however, summarize it succinctly. \nMind-boggling. Implausible. Or perhaps this quotation from his Canadian catcher, the first player Anthopoulos reeled in when he started revamping the Blue Jays into a champion 11 months ago. \n“There’s not many things that feel better than that,” said Russ Martin, as Champagne slithered into his beard. \nMartin was talking about one of the wildest games in post-season history and specifically Jose Bautista, whose powerful swing turned the tide and whose bat-flip enraged the entire state of Texas. \nBautista’s three-run homer capped a rollicking roller-coaster of a seventh inning and provided the decisive lift the Toronto Blue Jays needed in a 6-3 victory over the Rangers, propelling them into the American League Championship Series for the first time in 22 years. \nIt was karma, come quickly. In the top of the inning, one of the strangest plays anyone had ever seen had given the Rangers a 3-2 lead. It was a run born of a rulebook technicality. But then, in the bottom half, the Rangers committed three errors – all in a bizarre row – and the Jays tied it up. \nTwo were out when Bautista came up and rocketed a Sam Dyson fastball into the second deck. He tossed his bat high in the air – even by his standards – and took his sweet time circling the bases. A deafening, roof-shaking roar arose from nearly 50,000 fans, and it went on and on, like rolls of thunder that follow a lightning strike. \n“I can’t really remember what was going through my mind, to be quite honest with you,” Bautista said. “After I made contact, I didn’t plan anything that I did, and so I still don’t even know how I did it. I just enjoyed the moment, rounded the bases and got to the dugout. And after all the guys stopped punching me and hitting me is when I kind of started realizing what happened. I knew I did something great for the team.” \nGame 5 was great, too, for its tension, its noisy crescendos from delirious fans, its odd and unpredictable plays, its spectacular defence (by Toronto) and its fielding pratfalls (by Texas). And it capped an extraordinary series for the Jays, who looked like imposters as they lost the first two games at home, then roared back to win three straight. \n“I’m not going to say that we’re a team of destiny,” said R.A. Dickey. “I am going to say that we’re a team that plays hard every day and we’re not scared of anybody.” \nManager John Gibbons praised the Rangers as a worthy opponent – and until that crazy seventh inning, they were – but said a Toronto loss would have left him and his team with a feeling of mission unaccomplished. \n“It’s special for everybody around here because it’s been so long,” Gibbons said. “You can have a great year, and if you bow out in that first round, it’s still a good accomplishment but it just doesn’t seem right.” \nAdded Ben Revere, one of the famous five trade-deadline additions: “We’re trying to get the big one.” \nAs the clubhouse celebration wound down, the Jays did not even know their opponent in the American League Championship Series. But hours after the Blue Jays’ dramatic comeback, the Kansas City Royals completed one of their own, beating the Houston Astros 7-2 in their own Game 5 later on Wednesday. With the KC win, the Jays will start the ALCS on the road on Friday. \n*** \nAfter Marcus Stroman and Cole Hamels soldiered through six innings, the score was 2-2. Aaron Sanchez came in for the seventh and needed one more out when Martin made one of the oddest errors on record. \nHis return throw hit the bat of Shin-Soo Choo, who was in the left-handed batter’s box. The ball bounced toward shortstop. \nRougned Odor raced home from third, but plate umpire Dale Scott immediately waved the play off and ruled the ball dead. Texas manager Jeff Banister protested. After all six umpires huddled, Scott said the run counted. \nThe crowd went berserk. Gibbons argued to no avail. Then shortstop Troy Tulowitzki intercepted several umpires at his shortstop position and argued. A moment later, the umpires consulted video review officials in New York, just to check the rule, which resulted in the run counting and fans hurling beer cans – one of which nearly struck Scott ­– and other assorted objects onto the field. \nHowever illogical it might have appeared, the ruling was correct. Buried in Rule 6.03 is the critical judgment: if the catcher’s throw hits the bat of a hitter in the batter’s box, and there is no intent by the batter to interfere, “the ball is alive and in play.” \nMartin: “He waved it off at first and I said, ‘Thank God.’ But then they overturned it. I don’t think Choo did anything illegal. He was in the box. He just held his hand out there. I didn’t really see it. I threw the ball like I always do, probably over a million times.” \nScott knew quickly that he had erred in his call. \n“I was mixing up two rules and I called time, but then it started clicking,” Scott said. “I went, wait a minute, wait a minute, there’s no intent on the hitter. He’s in the box, the bat’s in the box.” \nGibbons protested to no avail. The umps huddled again after Tulowitzki made his case. The play itself was not reviewable. The call to New York was just to make sure they had correctly applied the rule. \nTulowitzki: “I was making a pretty strong case out there. How could you make that call? How could you say that (Choo) wasn’t doing it on purpose? It could’ve been a play that they had drawn up where he just stands there and holds the bat out. And I just think it opens up for too much error.” \nBut, Tulowitzki added, “It’s great that I’m sitting here talking about us winning, not like, oh, this is why we lost the game.” \nDickey: “I knew the game wasn’t going to end 3-2 on that stupid play.” \n*** \nAlong the way, Toronto benefited from splendid defence, including another eye-popping diving catch by Kevin Pillar, and several nifty stops by Ryan Goins – one saved a run – and a barehanded grab and throw by Josh Donaldson. \nAn inning before Bautista’s historic blast, his close friend Edwin Encarnacion lifted the Jays into a tie with a second-deck homer. The Rangers had pitched him warily all series, but this time, Hamels grooved a first-pitch fastball and Encarnacion crushed it. Pent-up frustration exploded in jubilation in the dugout and throughout the stadium. The Jays had trailed throughout, and would again after the weirdness of the top of the seventh. \nThe tension persisted after Bautista’s homer. Aaron Sanchez got an out in the eighth, but two Rangers reached base. In came Osuna, the 20-year-old closer. He struck out two in a row. In his perfect ninth, he struck out the final two batters. \nOsuna’s icy demeanour always lasts until he records the final out, and then he reaches and points to the heavens, for he is a religious young man and wears a tattoo on his arm that says God makes all things possible. As Will Venable swung and missed the third strike, Osuna sent up his praises once again, and then a mob of jumping teammates praised him. \nThere was more to that quote from Martin, way back at the beginning of this dispatch. He had been asked about the feeling of relief when Bautista delivered the decisive blow, and after a smile, he answered this way. \n“Relief?” he said. “I don’t even know if that’s the right word. There’s not many things that feel better than that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:46:42.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
