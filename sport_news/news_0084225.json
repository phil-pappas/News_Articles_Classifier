I was just happy to get a few birdies and make pars where I could.\"Short birdied the par-5 15, saved par with a 10-footer on the par-3 16th, made a 12-foot birdie putt on the par-4 17th and closed with an 8-foot birdie putt on the par-4 18th.\"I hit it over the green on 16. I hit a chip shot about 10 feet by and I made it,\" Short said. \"Then, it seemed like the hole got in the way on the last two holes. I think that was a key putt. ... It's pretty windy out there today. The greens are pretty fast, so it's really hard to be aggressive on the greens, especially on the downhill putts. They can get away from you pretty easily.\"Short is 23rd on the money list with $636,989.
