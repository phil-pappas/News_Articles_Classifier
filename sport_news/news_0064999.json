Other Stories New GOP front-runner makes Iowa visit... \nAfter Baylor raced out to a 28-0 lead in the second quarter, things could have gotten much worse. Afterall, ISU's last trip to Waco resulted in a 71-7 loss, the worst in school history. This time, ISU battled back. \nWith Sam Richardson struggling again at quarterback, backup Joel Lanning saw his role increase greatly. He came in and led ISU to its first TD drive, which ended with a Joshua Thomas TD run. ISU trailed 35-7 at the half. \nLanning was just getting warmed up. In the third quarter, he found Quenton Bundrage for a short TD, and then connected with Jauan Wesley to cut the Baylor lead to just 15 points. Lanning added another late TD and finished the game 12/17 for 144 yards, 3 TDs and no interceptions. He did so without star WR Allen Lazard, who missed the game with a shoulder injury. It looks like Lanning, the sophomore from Ankeny, is positioned to earn his first career start next weekend at home against Texas. \nISU was also missing starting safety Kamari Cotton-Moya. The defense, however, also had a huge second half. ISU held Baylor, the top scoring offense in college football (64 ppg), to just 10 points after halftime. It was Baylor's lowest scoring game of the season. \nBaylor won the game, but was dealt a potentially terrible blow to their playoff hopes. After the game, star QB Seth Russell was diagnosed with a fractured bone in his neck. His timetable is unknown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:03:22.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
