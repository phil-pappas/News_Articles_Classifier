Sometimes in this business you have to win like this.” \nA win against Missouri – in any form – is major progress. \nThe Tigers handed the Gators their most-lopsided SEC losses each of the past two seasons – 36-17 in 2013 and 41-13 in 2014. Last season’s Missouri win came during Florida’s homecoming game. \nThe Gators (6-0, 4-0 SEC) returned the favor Saturday night in Columbia, Mo., ruining the Tigers’ homecoming game before an announced crowd of 70,767. The win, coupled with a loss by Georgia (4-2, 2-2) at Tennessee, strengthened Florida’s hold on first place in the SEC East. \nKentucky (4-1, 2-1) is a game behind Florida in the standings, but the Wildcats lost 14-9 to the Gators on Sept. 19. \nThe Missouri win also set up a showdown between two unbeatens, at LSU this upcoming Saturday. The Gators and Tigers will likely be ranked in the top-10 and SEC division leaders when they face off. \nThe matchup will pit the Gators’ defense against Heisman frontrunner Leonard Fournette. \n“Best defense in the country against the best player in the country, I would say that,” Florida sophomore cornerback Jalen Tabor said. \nIn Columbia, the Gators scored an opening-drive touchdown for the first time in nearly two years during an otherwise erratic night on offense. Tabor had his second pick-six of the season – UF’s only second-half points – to lead another suffocating defensive effort by the Gators, who have not allowed a touchdown during two SEC road games. \nMissouri entered the game last in the SEC in offense and showed why. The Tigers finished the contest 0-of-13 on third down, while freshman quarterback Drew Lock looked like an 18-year-old making his second college start. \nLock finished 15-of-37 passing for 146 yards, two interceptions and a passer rating of 62.9. \nBehind redshirt freshman quarterback Will Grier, the Gators’ offense endured its own struggles, especially in the second half when the two teams opened with seven straight three-and-out possessions. \nA week after a near-flawless outing against Ole Miss, Grier finished 20-of-33 passing for 208 yards, no touchdown and four sacks. He also had no turnovers. \n“I thought he got spooked,” McElwain said. “I thought he saw some ghosts. I didn’t think he played very good, but he played great because he didn’t throw it to the guys in the other jersey.” \nBut Grier and the Gators did enough against Mizzou, which boasts the SEC’s No. 1 defense. \nUF opened the game with a 12-play, 75-yard touchdown drive. \nFlorida had gone three-and-out on offense to start the past four games, but Missouri put together its first opening touchdown drive since a 2013 loss at South Carolina – a stretch of 21 games. Each drive ended with a touchdown by tailback Kelvin Taylor, who scored from a yard out Saturday night. \nAt Missouri, the Gators used a nice balance between the run and pass to march down the field against the SEC’s leading defense. Grier finished the drive 3-of-4 passing for 39 yards, while Taylor had six carries for 21 yards. \nThe Tigers wasted no time answering the Gators, needing just three plays to go 59 yards to the Florida 6. \nBut coordinator Geoff Collins’ bend-but-don’t break defense held, forcing the Tigers to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Andrew Baggett. Florida has now given up just five touchdown in 15 red-zone trips by opponents. \nMissouri’s offense did not threaten the Gators the rest of the game. A 53-yard miss by Baggett was the Tigers’ best scoring opportunity. \nMeanwhile, Florida shook off a three-and-out on its second drive to build its lead to 14-3. Following a 10-yard run by Grier, a facemask penalty by Tigers’ defensive tackle Terry Beckner at the end of a sack gave Florida the ball on the Missouri 41. \nTaylor followed with a 19-yard run and Grier a 21-yard completion to Ahmad Fulwood to set up a another one-yard touchdown by Taylor, who finished with 99 rushing yards on 28 carries. \nThe early surge was all the Gators needed on offense to improve to 6-0 and become one of the first teams in the country to clinch bowl eligibility. \n“If we have 14 points,” Tabor said of UF’s defense, “it’s going to be tough to beat us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:56:44.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
