Dmitry Hrynkevich Ralph Riegel â€“ 05 October 2015 03:00 AM\nDetectives in Kerry have launched a murder investigation following the death of Dmitry Hrynkevich (24), the third-tallest man in Ireland at 7ft 6in (2.32m), at Killeen Wood, Tralee, last Wednesday.\nMr Hrynkevich was found lying on the front lawn of a property in the estate shortly after 10.30pm with serious head injuries and was taken to Kerry General Hospital.\nHe was placed on a life- support machine, but never regained consciousness.\nHEARTBROKEN\nHe died on Friday evening with his heartbroken family by his side.\nSupt Jim O'Connor described the incident as \"very serious\" given the injuries Mr Hryn-kevich sustained.\n\"This is a very serious matter and we appealing for help from the public,\" he said.\nFor operational reasons, gardai have declined to release the results of the post-mortem examination conducted at Kerry General Hospital by the State Pathologist's Office.\nBut it is understood that Mr Hrynkevich suffered catastrophic head injuries consistent with a brutal and prolonged attack.\nMr Hrynkevich is understood to have attended the Killeen Wood property with a number of other people on Wednesday for a party.\nHe was born in Russia but grew up in Killarney, where he had addresses at Aghadoe and Bishop's Court. The Herald understands he had been targeted before because of his height. Even in his early teens, he had stood more than six feet tall.\nTwo men were arrested by gardai in the vicinity of Killeen Woods on Wednesday evening. Both were questioned at Tralee Garda Station before being released without charge.\nThe pair, in their late 20s and early 30s, are eastern European nationals though neither is Russian. Both have addresses in the Kerry area.\nGardai sealed off the semi- detached house which is located in a quiet cul-de-sac.\nOfficers then carried out door-to-door inquiries and conducted a detailed forensic examination of the scene.\nInvestigating gardai are appealing for witnesses, or anyone who could provide background information, to come forward.\nThey are appealing particularly to anyone who was in the vicinity of Killeen Woods at the time of the incident to contact them.\nDetectives believe a number of people were in the property in question on Wednesday evening and have appealed to them to contact gardai in Tralee, even if they had left before the incident occurred.\nThey are also keen to clarify Mr Hrynkevich's movements on Wednesday.\nSHOCK\nGardai are convinced that the fatal attack began inside the property before spilling out on to the front lawn.\nLocals expressed shock at the tragedy.\n\"I had heard that there was some kind of a party taking place at the house,\" one local man said.\n\"When I came back to my own house on Wednesday night there were a load of guards around the place.\n\"That was the first time I heard that there had been an assault and that someone had been hurt.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:35:09.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
