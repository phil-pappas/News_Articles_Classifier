Tom Cruise plays Seal in the movie produced by Universal Pictures, Inc.\nThe suit was filed Wednesday in Baton Rouge District Court by one of the daughters of pilot and drug smuggler, Barry Seal.In 1963, Seal married Barbara Dodson. They had two children, Lisa and Adler. In 1971, Seal and Barbara were divorced. After his divorce, he married Lynn Ross that same year, and was divorced in 1972. No children were born of that marriage. In 1974, Seal married Deborah Dubois. They had three children, Aaron, Christina, and Dean.\nThe lawsuit states Seal's third wife, Debbie, and her three children received $350,000 for Barry's story of smuggling for both the CIA and drug lords in Nicaragua.\nAccording to the suit, Seal's daughter Lisa Seal Frigon, whom he had with his first wife, was appointed as administratrix of Barry Seal's estate on June 2, 2015.\n\"Defendants Debbie, Aaron, Christina and Dean have never sought the rights nor the court's authority to convey the Life Story Rights of Adler Berriman Seal to Universal, which rights are the property of the estate and subject to administration,\" the lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit also states, \"Although the Life Story Rights of Adler Berriman Seal are property of the Estate, Defendants Debbie, Aaron, Christina and Dean have failed to remit to the Estate any proceeds which they received from their Agreement with Defendant Universal, but instead converted the proceeds for their own personal use and benefit.\"\nLawyer Roy Maughan said scenes have already been shot in the town of Mena in Arkansas and in Atlanta.\nLisa reviewed the script of the movie and said it is based on the life of her father, however, \"it contains many factual inaccuracies and thus falsely portrays Adler Berriman Seal.\" The lawsuit goes on to say the motion picture uses the personal name of Adler Berriman Seal and his nickname, \"Barry Seal.\"\n\"Well, obviously, if the agreement for the life story rights of Barry Seal was not properly executed, I would think that Universal would be cautious about proceeding to a theater with the movie without making the appropriate arrangements,\" Maughan said.\nThe lawsuit states the movie misrepresents Seal's marital history; portrays him as the father of three children, not five; misrepresents his work history; falsely portrays him as a drunkard; misrepresents his relationship with his two oldest children; falsely portrays him a reckless pilot; and falsely portrays his place and manner of death.\nThe lawsuit also states Barry Seal's persona has been damaged, which \"diminishes the value of his estate.\"\nOverall, the lawsuit is attempting to stop the movie from being released to the public.\nUniversal, Ron Howard, Imagine Entertainment, and Gary Spinelli were advised on March 4, 2015 that its claim to ownership of the Life Story Rights of Adler Berriman Seal was defective, invalid, unauthorized, and in violation of law, according to the lawsuit.\nUniversal, through its agents and assignees, claim Mena \" Is the story of framed drug trafficker Bary Seal and the work he did for the Medellin cartel and the CIA in Mena, Arkansas.\" \"The true story of Barry Seal, a Louisiana-born pilot who trafficked drugs undercover for the CIA in the 1980s, based on his multimillion dollar operation in podunk Mena, Arkansas, and who eventually met his end at the hands of the infamous Medellin drug cartel.\" \"Based on the true story of Barry Seal, a thrill seeking pilot discovers the perfect rush when presented the opportunity to smuggle drugs... for the CIA.\" \"Based on true events, a commercial pilot partners with Colombians while working covertly for the CIA and leads a massive, secret drug ring that operates out of Mena, Arkansas.\"\nThe motion picture, Mena , is scheduled to be released in 2017.\nOn September 11, 2015, a small plane carrying crew members working on the film Mena crashed into a jungled mountain in Colombia. Two crew workers were killed in the crash and another was seriously injured. Just 10 minutes before the small plane crashed, Tom Cruise flew in a helicopter in the same flight path across the Colombian Andes.\nAlan Purwin, a veteran Hollywood pilot, Venezuelan Carlos Berl were killed in the crash. American Jimmy Lee Garland survived. Officials say all three were experienced pilots. They were flying to the city of Medellin after a day of filming.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
