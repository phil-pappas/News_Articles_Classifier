The Giants had their special run package in the game, too, which was even more alarming.\nPass offense: D \nOdell Beckham Jr. caught seven passes in the first half, including a 13-yard touchdown, and did not appear limited by his hamstring. For some inexplicable reason, the Giants only targeted him once in the second half. Eli Manning’s first pick was on Larry Donnell, but the second that Nolan Carroll returned for a touchdown was awful.\nRun defense: D \nThe Giants allowed DeMarco Murray to post his first 100-yard game of the season. Their speed on the edge was severely lacking. Two weeks in a row, the Giants’ stellar numbers against the opposing ground game has taken a hit.\nPass defense: C \nDamontre Moore is losing the trust of the coaching staff. His roughing the passer penalty was unacceptable, wasting a three-and-out and leading to the Eagles’ first touchdown. Three interceptions of Sam Bradford were gift-wrapped, including the first of rookie S Landon Collins’ career. They should have had at least one more. When starting FB Nikita Whitlock is the team’s most effective pass rusher, that’s concerning.\nSpecial teams: C \nP Brad Wing struggled for the first time as a Giant. The coverage teams did an admirable job on Darren Sproles and Josh Huff. Whitlock was called for a roughing the punter penalty.\nCoaching: D \nTom Coughlin had no answer as to why the Giants did not ask for a measurement or consider challenging the spot on third-and-1. The offensive play calling following Manning’s first of two interceptions was shaky at best. How Beckham was targeted just once despite double coverage is mind-boggling.\n— Art Stapleton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:32.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
