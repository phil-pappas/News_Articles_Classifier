When asked about his plans by reporters, Blatt said James would \"probably play...one of the two.\"\nSo between James' declaration to play in Columbus and Blatt's apparent wishes to sit James in one of the next two games, it looks like Cleveland's ticket holders will be out of luck Tuesday.\nFear not, northeast Ohio. In addition to those 41 home games at The Q, the Cavs will play another preseason game there Thursday against Indiana. The odds are good James will suit up for that game.\nJames collected eight points, seven rebounds, five assists and shot 3-of-13 in 22 minutes against Atlanta in Cleveland's preseason-opening loss to Atlanta in Cincinnati on Wednesday. James didn't play in Philadelphia against the Sixers the following night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:32:38.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
