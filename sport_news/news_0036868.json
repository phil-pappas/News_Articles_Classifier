The world's biggest football federation must do everything in its powers to clear this up,\" said Green Party Member of Parliament Ozcan Mutlu, who is a member of the parliamentary committee on sport.\n\"We expect this as sports politicians and we expect this as a society from everyone who was involved in that World Cup,\" said Mutlu, a fierce critic of FIFA.\nGermany's Justice Minister Heiko Maas also waded in, calling for a thorough investigation into the claims.\n\"These allegations must be investigated uncompromisingly. Football fans have the rights for that,\" Maas wrote on Twitter.\nWith any probe likely to raise further questions and possibly open more damaging wounds, Niersbach's chances of running for one of soccer's top posts are looking more remote than ever in the current climate.\n($1 = 0.8814 euros, 0.9530 Swiss francs)\n(Editing by John O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:25:59.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
