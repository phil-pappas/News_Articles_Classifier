Guys have dug in and we've had some tough days along the way. We gauged everything and thought that this was maybe a good day. Flyers coach Dave Hakstol on canceling practice, final cut Flyers coach Dave Hakstol talks about canceling practice and having to make one more training camp cut on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015 at Skate Zone in Voorhees, N.J. (Randy Miller/NJ Advance Media) \n\"It's not a day off. We're getting work done. We're doing stuff off the ice .. but physically it gives them an opportunity to hopefully recharge and maybe with not being on the ice recharge even a little bit mentally.\" \nHere are 5 Flyers things we learned Thursday: \n1. GM Ron Hextall still has one cut to make to get down to 23, the regular-season limit. It appears 21-year-old center Scott Laughton or defenseman Brandon Manning will be the final cut, but it's still possible Hextall frees up a spot by making a trade. Defenseman Luke Schenn is the most likely candidate to go in a deal, although the Flyers would love to find a taker for center Vinny Lecavalier. \"It's a tough decision here,\" Hextall said. \"Do you expose certain guys to waivers (such as Manning)? ... Do they get claimed? Do you send a young guy (like Laughton) down because we don't have a spot? It's a tough one. We'll sift through everything and come up with a decision.\" Flyers' Ron Hextall on roster Flyers general manager Ron Hextall talks about needing to make one more cut before the regular season on a day Chris Porter was claimed off waivers by Minnesota on Oct. 1, 2015 in Voorhees, N.J. (Randy Miller/NJ Advance Media) \n2. Center Sean Couturier and left wing Michael Raffl, both battling upper-body injuries that aren't serious, skated for 45 minutes Thursday morning. Look for both to sit out Friday's game as a precaution and be ready for next Thursday's regular-season opener at Tampa Bay. \"I don't know that either one will play (Friday),\" Hextall said. \"We're not going to expose them if we think it's better to keep them out. You like your players to play in games, but if it's better to give them a few days to heal we'll do that.\" \n3 . Left wing Chris Porter, placed on waivers Wednesday, was claimed Thursday by the Minnesota Wild. Porter is a native Canadian, but lives in Eden Prairie, Minn., which is 22 miles west of St. Paul, which is home to the Wild. Also, Porter will reunite with former North Dakota University teammate Zach Parise, the best man in his wedding. Porter also was a groomsman in Parise's wedding. \n4. The Flyers are hoping No. 2 goalie Michal Neuvirth, who left Wednesday's game with a lower-body injury, is able to participate in Friday's morning skate. Neuvirth originally suffered the injury during Monday's morning skate, then returned Wednesday only to get hurt again. Steve Mason is slated to start in goal Friday. \n5. Hakstol wants to play Friday's game as if it's a regular-season game. \"It's a dry run in the fact that we want to play well for 60 minutes and we want to do things the right way,\" he said. \nRandy Miller may be reached at rmiller@njadvancemedia.com .
