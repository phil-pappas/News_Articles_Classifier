This game will give him a lot of confidence going forward.\" \nLamar (5-0, 2-0) jumped out to a 21-0 lead in the first quarter with Wilkins scoring on special teams, then later on offense. \nWilkins returned a fumbled Mansfield (1-4, 0-2) punt 29 yards for a touchdown to give the Warriors a 7-0 lead with 10:04 left in the first quarter. \nLamar quarterback Hunter Davenport found Austin Hency for a 60-yard touchdown pass after that to extend the lead to 14-0 with 5:50 left in the first quarter. \nWilkins then found the end zone offensively, scoring on a 10-yard rush to push the lead to 21-0 with 1:10 left in the first quarter. \nWilkins had 113 yards rushing on 8 carries with 2 touchdowns, recovered the fumbled punt for a touchdown and had a 45-yard interception return all in the first half. \n\"They are a well-coached team with a lot of talent,\" Mansfield Coach Brandon Elmore said. \"They pretty much could do whatever they wanted offensively. They are hard to stop. We tried to run a power-run set to try to slow them down. It didn't work.\" \nThe Lamar offense didn't let up in the second quarter, pushing the lead to 42-0 heading into halftime. \nThe Warriors scored on their first six possessions of the first half to build their lead. Lamar outgained Mansfield 296 to 21 in the first two quarters. \nDavenport was 4 for 4 passing for 112 yards with 2 touchdowns for the Warriors. Senior wide receiver Blake Kern finished with three catches for 52 yards and a touchdown. \n\"Our kids really came out to play,\" Jones said. \"They came out fired up and ready to go. We just played well. Davenport didn't run the ball for us much, but he played so well passing and managing the game.\" \nMansfield got its offense going after halftime capping its first second-half drive with a 25-yard touchdown rush from quarterback Christian Saygnaphay to cut the lead to 42-7. \nTigers running back Joseff Bucella led the way rushing 8 times for 101 yards with 2 touchdowns. \n\"I thought my kids kept fighting hard,\" Elmore said. \"The game was getting away from us early, but I'm proud my guys didn't quit and moved the ball in the second half. Most things didn't go well, but we didn't give up.\" \nLamar's Joe Mueller finished with five carries for 71 yards including a touchdown to push the lead to 50-7 in the third quarter. \nSports on 10/03/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:35:58.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
