Lions at Commonwealth Stadium for the second time in four weeks.\nIf anyone is going to derail Edmonton’s bye to the West Final, it could be a desperate Lions team.\n“Their offence is playing very well right now,” said Eskimos linebacker J.C. Sherritt. “Their quarterback is playing as well as anyone in the league, and obviously, we know the capabilities of (Emmanuel) Arceneaux and (Andrew) Harris. We’re looking at a high-powered offence and they beat us once and took us to the limit another time. We know we have to prepare for a good team.”\nThe Eskimos were able to pull out a 29-23 victory over the Lions three weeks ago, battling back from an eight-point, fourth-quarter deficit.\nThe Eskimos then went on to win their next two road games in Winnipeg and Calgary respectively, to run their winning streak to five games.\n“They’re going to be competitive, they’re going to come in here wanting to win,” said Eskimos receiver Kenny Stafford, who caught the lone touchdown for the Eskimos in the 15-11 win over Calgary. “They have to win to get in the playoffs. They want to knock us off. They were up in that game last time here at home, so I’m pretty sure they think they can win. Granted they were in the game until we started making plays, but I expect them to be very fired up coming in here.”\nThe Lions are currently third in the West with a 5-9 record, battling with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and the Montreal Alouettes — via the crossover — for a berth into the CFL playoffs.\nThey lost a critical game to the Blue Bombers this past Saturday, which dropped them back in to a third-place tie in the division.\n“They have a great team coming in here, they’re hungry, they want to make the playoffs, so we’re going to have our hands full,” said Eskimos safety Cauchy Muamba. “They’re a team that never gives up. They’ve been good in the past few years.\n“Their new quarterback (Jonathon) Jennings, he’s been playing well. He’s found a rhythm, he trusts his receivers and Harris has always been good, so they’re going to give us a lot of problems. They’re really pushing for a playoff spot and they’re going to do everything that they can to try and win.”\nJennings is expected to get the start for the Lions against the Eskimos in place of Travis Lulay, who recently returned from a knee injury.\nJennings went 24-for-31 for 372 yards and three touchdowns with two interceptions against the Blue Bombers. The rookie has nine touchdown passes and a 66.7 completion percentage so far this season in relief of Lulay.\n“He’s played awful good for them,” said Eskimos head coach Chris Jones. “Travis has been an awful good quarterback for a long time, but he has battled injuries. They know their players better than I do, but Jennings has played good.”\nPrior to losing to Matt Nichols and the Blue Bombers, Jennings led the Lions to a 46-20 win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders the previous week, throwing for 364 yards and four touchdowns in the process.\nThis will be Jennings’ second crack at the Eskimos, getting the start three weeks ago.\n“He has all the intangibles that you look for,” Jones said. “He’s a guy that is very calm and the games seems extremely slow for him. He’s got a tremendously strong arm. Against us in zone (defence), he did a very good job of finding the open receiver. If he needs to use his legs, he can also run around and try to throw the football.”\nderek.vandiest@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/SUNdvandiest\nEskimos says B.C.
