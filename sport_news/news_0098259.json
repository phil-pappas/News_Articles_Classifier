This week's semifinal will be played on a large FIFA-sized smooth pitch. The stadium's recent renovation project included FieldTurf, which favors possession-oriented teams, but is quite slick when wet. \nClifton can push the pace or form a defensive barrier. Seniors Frankie Salensky, Bruno Frascolla and Romario DePalmar are the leaders and sophomores Tommy Miazga and Michael Algieri are the future of the program. \nWayne Valley's back four of Aneesh Bhave, Matt Bleeker, Scott Sherin and Brandon Vecere have bonded, while senior goalkeeper Matt Mihalik has been solid. \n\"I'm happy for the players; they've bonded,\" Roca added. \n2-Hawthorne Christian vs. 6-Wayne Hills, 2 p.m.: The opening game in Clifton has teeth. The Patriots' stingy defense must contend with Rene White and Will Woodfin. White is a prolific scorer, but set up two goals in the Defenders 3-1 win over Passaic in the quarterfinals. Last year, Wayne Hills toppled HCA, 5-4, in a wild quarterfinal. The Patriots seem to be mounting another late season push, using the counties as a springboard. That means coach Nelson Graham's side is within touching distance of a seventh crown. HCA is looking to reach the program's first final. \nEditor's note: Fans should arrive early to Clifton School Stadium -located on Route 46 West behind Christopher Columbus Middle School-because parking in the adjacent school lot is limited. \nPatriots, Indians in girls' semis \nWhereas the boys' tournament has a few wrinkles in its bracket, the girls' top four seeds advanced to the semifinals. \nThe girls' tournament will play its semifinals Saturday at Wayne Valley's stadium: \n1-Wayne Hills vs. 4-Wayne Valley, 4 p.m.: The second game of the doubleheader is a Wayne derby. How fortuitous! Wayne Valley showed resilience last week, scoring twice after the interval to turn back fifth-seeded DePaul Catholic, 3-2. Randi Smith (13 goals), Alexa Simonetti and Imani Thompson are Wayne Valley's primary scoring threats, while Jen Cannarella is the playmaker. \nWayne Hills bounced back in the quarterfinals after a rare regular-season loss (4-0 to IHA) and have already beaten Wayne Valley, 2-1, on Sept. 21. (They play again on Oct. 27 in league play.) \nThe Patriots defend well and feature Meghan Griffin, who drives the offensive engine. Both programs have won 11 county titles, with the winner gaining the inside track for a dozen. Needless to say, the stakes are high. \n2-Clifton vs. 3-Lakeland, 2 p.m.: The Mustangs opened the week unbeaten in 11 games and continue their march to the county final. The semifinals won't be easy on a neutral field. \nClifton's backline with Chelsea Robinson and Sharon Garcia are in synch, while the midfield has playmaker Brittany Morales and up front there's Daniella LoBue and high-scoring Meaghan Mancini (12 goals). \nThe Lancers were scoreless at the break last weekend, but rallied for a 4-0 win over Hawthorne.
