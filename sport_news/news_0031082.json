The first, a third-and-nine at the Fitch 49-yard line, Fitch converted thanks to a 14-yard jet sweep by Marquis Barbel, and the second, a third-and-10 at the Lakeside 37, Fowler scrambled for another 14 yards to set up the touchdown. \n“Any time you can score on the first drive, that’s always a plus, and it does kind of set the tempo for your team for the rest of the game,” Annarella said. “It was important. We had talked about it, and we were fortunate enough to convert a couple of big third down plays on that drive.” \nThe Dragon defense got no respite for the rest of the first half, due in large part to a couple of Lakeside turnovers that gave the Falcons great field position. Fitch started three of its six drives inside Lakeside territory, with all but one ending in a touchdown, and the Falcons enjoyed an average starting position of the Lakeside 47-yard line. \nHall didn’t make any excuses for his defense, which he said he considers the strength of the team. The Dragons allowed another rushing touchdown of 20-plus yards when Jaylon Sanders went untouched along the visiting sideline for a 21-yard score a the 3:34 mark in the first, and Fowler added a pair of touchdown passes in the second quarter to give the Falcons a 35-point lead at halftime. \nIn fact, he pointed to all three aspects of the game struggling on Friday, as the offense recorded just one first down in the first half and the special team gave up a 62-yard punt return for a touchdown by Fitch’s J.C. Mikovich at the 1:16 mark in the first quarter to give the Falcons a 21-0 lead. \nThe second half went a little better for the Dragons, as they held the Falcons scoreless with just two first downs. \nMore importantly for Hall, though, was that Lakeside showed some life on the offense. The Dragons managed to get the ground game going, especially through senior wideout Johnny Evans on the sweep. Evans totaled 74 yards on six carries — all but one of which came in the second half. \nThe Dragons managed to convert the offensive production into points when quarterback Spencer Loftus connected with Jared Patton on a 12-yard touchdown pass with 3:52 remaining in the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:53:21.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
