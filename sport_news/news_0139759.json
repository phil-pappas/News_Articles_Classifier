Another is former New York Post reporter Natasha Velez, whose grandfather Miguel Velez was an NYPD officer for 21 years and survived being shot on the job.\nBratton stirred controversy in June when he told The Guardian newspaper he had a hard time hiring black cops because too many black people have criminal records.\nHe also said that relations between the NYPD and black residents were badly frayed long before he took over.\nSince then, Bratton has made a commitment to double the number of black cadets in the Police Academy over the next year and has order the NYPD to find ways of streamlining the hiring process.\nDe Blasio has also actively encouraged more minority New Yorkers to apply for jobs with the police department.\nttracy@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Bill Bratton swears in 'most diverse' NYPD academy classes NYPD's Bill Bratton predicts boost in hiring of black cops NYPD Deputy Chief Kim Royster promoted to assistant chief Tags: nypd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:18:32.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
