The “path” was organised to pray for peace in the state. Badal said it was not appropriate to reveal the outcome of the police investigation at the moment, but the faces of such forces would be before the public soon as the probe was in final phase. He said it was a high time that all political leaders must come forward and make people aware about the nefarious designs of such forces to foil their attempts. He claimed the police had nabbed culprits in five of the seven incidents of sacrilege. He said the remaining two cases would be cracked soon and exemplary punishment would be given to the accused, said the Chief Minister. ‘Oppn politicising issue’\nComing down heavily on the Opposition, Badal said the parties were trying to get political mileage out of the dastardly act of sacrilege. He said the protest and forcible closures of markets organised by some forces were of no use as they harassed the general public. Others who spoke on the occasion included Daljeet Singh Cheema, Madan Mohan Mittal and Prem Singh Chandumajra. Jathedar leaves early\nTakht Sri Kesgarh Sahib Jathedar Giani Mal Singh maintained a low profile at the today’s event. Throughout the occasion, Jathedar kept sitting at a distance from Badal and ignored the requests of SAD leaders to occupy seat adjoining him. Later, the Jathedar left the venue immediately after the “ardas” without wishing the CM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:04:28.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
