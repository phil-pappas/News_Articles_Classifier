Knorr ... more > By Todd Dybas - The Washington Times   \nRandy Knorr has a new title with the Washington Nationals. It’s not “Manager.” \nThe Nationals announced Monday that Knorr will be the Senior Assistant to the General Manager, Player Development, changing his role from bench coach. \nKnorr has been with the organization for more than a decade. The last four years, he was the bench coach for two managers, Davey Johnson, and the recently fired Matt Williams. General manager Mike Rizzo did not initially rule Knorr out of the candidates to become the next manager. But, Monday’s announcement makes it appear the Nationals will keep one of the most liked men in the organization around the team, but not as the next manager. \nThe team also announced that former third base coach Bob Henley will be Senior Advisor, Player Development. Former bullpen coach Matt LeCroy will manage Double-A Harrisburg. Harrisburg manager Brian Daubach has been promoted to hitting coach for the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs. \nThe Nationals fired Williams and his staff Oct. 5. Rizzo said at the time “several” of the fired coaches were offered other positions within the organization, and that he hoped they would accept. \nAmong those fired and not in new positions are former pitching coach Steve McCatty, former hitting coach Rick Schu, former first base coach Tony Tarasco, and defensive coordinator/advance coach Mark Weidemaier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:47:24.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
