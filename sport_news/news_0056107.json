Flyers general manager Ron Hextall told CSNPhilly.com there's \"a lot of positive signs\" and the \"indications are it's fairly isolated in his leg.\" \nPyett signed a one-year contract with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms after being at the Flyers' training camp. He was selected by Detroit in the seventh round of the 2006 NHL entry draft. He signed as a free agent with the New York Rangers in 2012 and spent two seasons in the Kontinental Hockey League. \nThe Flyers opened the season with a 3-2 overtime loss at Tampa Bay on Thursday night. They're led by new coach Dave Hakstol, who spent the past 11 seasons coaching at the University of North Dakota. Seven of his teams at North Dakota reached the NCAA Frozen Four. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:21:18.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
