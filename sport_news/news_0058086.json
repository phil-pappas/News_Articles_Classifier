Saturday afternoon at Stokes Stadium, the Bulldogs decided to make their own luck. Truman blocked two field goals, kicked two of its own and the Bulldog defense stymied Southwest Baptist’s attack in a 23-14 win before a packed homecoming crowd. Wearing throwback uniforms from the 1978 season, Truman tried to turn back the clock on its own season that had started a disappointing 1-4. A win in just their second home game of the season left the Bulldogs hopeful they could make some noise in the GLVCdown the stretch. “Hopefully, we flip the script,”Truman head coach Gregg Nesbitt said. Southwest Baptist entered the game averaging 450 yards and 35 points per contest, but looked completely overmatched by the GLVC-leading Bulldog defense. The Bearcats managed only 286 yards of offense, with 127 of those coming on two plays. “We’ve been going against a lot of good players, a lot of good athletes in different positions. We’re trying to do our best to shut them down. We don’t focus on them, we focus on the offense as a whole and Ithink that’s what’s letting us put up a good defense like this,”Truman sophomore nose guard Brian Craft said. Truman seemed to have the game in hand after taking the ball to start the third quarter and driving 75 yards for a touchdown. Malique Robbins dashed in from 29-yards out to cap the march and put the Bulldogs on top, 17-0. But on the ensuing possession, Southwest Baptist quarterback Trent Edwards threw a quick out to Kendrick Payne, who broke a tackle and raced 62 yards for a touchdown. The extra point was missed and the lead was cut to 17-6. “I had a terrible play call on a zero blitz (no safety help)at 17-0. I just got greedy and let (Southwest Baptist) climb back into it,”Nesbitt said. Later in the third quarter, Truman quarterback Randy Schroeder’s pass was picked off by Antion McBee and returned 31 yards for a touchdown. Edwards took the ball in on the two-point conversion and suddenly it was 17-14. But Southwest Baptist would come no closer. Truman’s Nick Dolezal booted a 30-yard field goal with 11:35 to go, making it 20-14. The Bearcats moved the ball on their next possession, picking up two first downs before a third-and-nine near midfield. Edwards hit Nathan Mourik near the sideline and Mourik raced back across the field toward open spaces before Truman safety Jordan Brown made an open-field tackle to force a punt. Brown said he was victimized on a similar play earlier in the game and wasn’t going to let it happen again. Page 2 of 2 - “Our coach always tells us to play with leverage and make them come back inside to our teammates,”Brown said. “I just stayed put because Iwanted to make sure he didn’t get outside me.” Truman’s Roger Howard iced the game with a 38-yard field goal with 1:46 to go, making it 23-14. Special teams were key for the Bulldogs, who were 2-for-2 on field goals and perfect on extra points. Meanwhile, the Bearcats missed one extra point and the Bulldogs blocked two field goals, one a combined block by Carter and Devin Gillespie and the second credited to Justin Mikeworth. “Those are big, big plays,”Nesbitt said. The win came in spite of a Truman offense that failed to capitalize on several opportunities. Schroeder threw one touchdown pass to Joey Schenck, but was intercepted three times, including a pick at the Bearcats’ 1-yard line. The offense also turned the ball over on downs in the red zone. “That gives us something to work on,”Nesbitt said. “The good news is our kids, despite a start that, really, none of us saw coming, they’ve continued to prepare well and continued to improve over the last few weeks. That was evident today and obviously we still have a lot to do. It’s much easier to correct after a big win.” Truman (2-4 overall, 2-2 GLVC) will head back to the road against Saint Francis (Ill.) Saturday at 1 p.m. The ’Dogs next play at home on Nov. 7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:49:09.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
