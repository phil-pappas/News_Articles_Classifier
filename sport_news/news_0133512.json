The complete list also includes:\nChic\nChicago\nCheap Trick\nDeep Purple\nJanet Jackson\nThe J.B.’s\nChaka Khan\nLos Lobos\nSteve Miller\nNine Inch Nails\nN.W.A.\nThe Smiths\nThe Spinners\nYes\nJust because a band is nominated doesn’t mean that they will be inducted. A committee of about 800 industry professionals will vote to decide who gets inducted. Usually six to eight bands will get the nod, and the announcement comes in December.\nFans can also vote for their favorite nominees on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website starting today. Just FYI: The fan vote counts for less than one percent of the overall vote.\nIf inducted, The Cars will join Aerosmith, Donna Summer, and more as Boston representatives in the Hall of Fame.\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Entertainment This legendary Boston band may finally earn a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 10.08.15 | 11:10 AM Events Here are five not-boring ways to spend Columbus Day weekend 10.08.15 | 9:46 AM Celebrity news Here’s your completely essential map of Matt Damon’s Boston 10.08.15 | 9:39 AM Performing arts Twelve Boston Ballet dancers created a stunning human sculpture 10.07.15 | 10:00 PM Celebrity news Ben and Jen’s L.A. mansion will cost you a pretty penny 10.07.15 | 1:04 PM Visual arts Why sheep are floating in the Boston Harbor 10.07.15 | 8:59 AM Celebrity news Tom and Gisele: The best/worst people to have at your wedding 10.06.15 | 4:41 PM Entertainment Go Back to the Future (II) and watch this mock trailer for Jaws 19 10.06.15 | 11:49 AM Music Kiss108’s Jingle Ball 2015 lineup: The Weeknd and a Jonas Brother are just the beginning 10.05.15 | 3:57 PM Entertainment Watch this man re-enact all of Breaking Bad as a one-hour show tomorrow in Somerville 10.05.15 | 2:25 PM Entertainment Watch the Dropkick Murphys close down The Beachcomber in style 10.05.15 | 1:12 PM TV A breakdown of The Leftovers opening scene no one expected 10.05.15 | 11:47 AM TV Hillary Clinton served up cocktails, killer Donald Trump impression as bartender named Val on SNL 10.04.15 | 11:55 AM Movies The Martian works because it makes science sexy 10.03.15 | 4:06 PM Events HUBweek starts Saturday.
