At the top end we've got some really experienced players who set a magnificent example to the youngsters, so I think we have a good balance. \n\"This season is unique because of the delayed start. We're about to go into a period of a minimum of 25 consecutive weeks with a Premiership or Champions Cup game, so we'll need everybody. \n\"It's going to be a real squad effort and we believe we've got the squad to do that.\" \nSale finished seventh in the table last season and have held on to influential fly-half Danny Cipriani, although losing forward Michael Paterson to Northampton is a blow to the club's hopes of survival. \nElsewhere on Saturday, beaten finalists Bath play host to Exeter in what should be an early barometer of the sides' credentials to make the top four. \nExeter only missed out on points difference last season and have signed Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Julian Salvi while Italian centre Michele Campagnaro has also joined from Treviso. \n\"The Premiership is very competitive at the moment, so if you're a top-six side then you're not going to be far off being a top-four side,\" Exeter boss Rob Baxter told the official club website. \n\"That's obviously where we want to be this year.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:09:06.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
