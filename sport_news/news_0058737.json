It’s unfathomable that a Chicago Cubs story would fly under the radar, but in a relative sense, this actually has. The national media wastes so much of our time by focusing on curses, goats, 1908, that fan from 2003 whose name we shall not say and other assorted shopworn platitudes in their Cubs coverage . Focusing on nonsense like that means Arrieta’s amazing accomplishments have gone somewhat overlooked. The Cubs ace had a 1.77 ERA in 2015. It’s reminiscent of Bob Gibson’s 1.12 ERA in 1968 or Pedro Martinez’s 2000 (1.74 ERA) or 1997 (1.74 ERA). Martinez did it twice, in the depths of the steroid era, so it’s especially impressive. While Arrieta’s Earned Run Average today is even more impressive than his Civil War era level of facial hair, this wasn’t always the case. Take a look at Jake Arrieta’s ERA numbers while he was in Baltimore. 2011- 5.05 ERA in 119 IP 2012- 6.20 ERA in 114 IP 2013- 7.23 ERA in 23 IP with the Orioles. The Texan turned it around once he got to Chicago though. (2013- 3.66 ERA in 51 IP, 2.53 ERA in 156 IP last season) So how did he do it? How did Jake Arrieta “get his groove back” so to speak? I asked Pedro Martinez (what better person) about the intellectual and psychological components of pitching, and how Arrieta developed that with his game. Pitching is more about what’s between your ears than fielding or hitting so I inquired as to how Arrieta got his mind right to become a Cy Young level superstar in 2015, after being utterly awful with the Os for a few years. Martinez was on media conference call today along with the other MLB on TBS analysts. Pedro Martinez on improvement made by Chicago Cubs starter Jake Arrieta this season: “There is a point in your career when everything clicks. You find the right pitching coach, the right atmosphere and the right manager. You feel comfortable with your teammates, and you feel comfortable with the way you are doing things. When everything comes together, something clicks. I think he went through a period where he was figuring out what he was trying to do. He said, ‘I’m not going to think about mechanics anymore. I’m just going to execute my pitches anyway I can.’ He found rhythm, he found he didn’t have to be like everyone else. He is working harder and harder, and now he is focused and determined. Right now, betting against Arrieta would be bad.” Gary Sheffield on whether Arrieta benefitted from a change of scenery: “The bottom line is, the trade happened. It woke him up, and he said, ‘I need to get serious, I need to do something different.’ If he stayed in the same situation, I truly believe he wouldn’t be the same pitcher. When you are in the same environment, and getting the same result, and all of a sudden the trade happens, it wakes you up. You say, ‘I have to show them it is going to be a bad loss for them.’ He has to prove something.” Here’s the audio, via Sound Cloud, embedded below, and broken up into two parts: More clips:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:18:53.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
