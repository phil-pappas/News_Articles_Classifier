What do we do next? \n\"And it becomes the norm. \n\"You've got four or five guys who have played around 100 games. \n\"You've got guys on the park who can do that for you. \n\"It's a learned skill like anything, and self-belief is a massive thing.\" \nMcCaw toasted his record 13th World Cup match as captain by driving the tenacious All Blacks to their second-straight tournament final. \nNew Zealand edged out France 8-7 in Auckland in 2011, and now have the right to defend their title. \nThe All Blacks would make history by retaining the Webb Ellis Cup, with Hansen quickly admitting his side must cut down their penalty count. \n\"Yeah it is worrying,\" said Hansen of New Zealand handing South Africa scoring chances from the tee. \n\"It makes it harder to overcome it. \n\"If we can sort that out it makes it harder for the opposition. \n\"So that's something we've got to sort out.\" \nAll Blacks assistant boss Ian Foster paid tribute to fly-half Carter for controlling New Zealand's increasingly-shrewd approach during a measured second half. \nSouth Africa led 12-7 at the break, Carter missing a regulation penalty and producing a cheap knock-on. \nThe 33-year-old - who missed the 2011 final through injury - recovered his poise however, later producing the crucial turnover that led to Barrett's winning try. \nFoster shied away from branding Carter's World Cup form his best yet, but praised the wily playmaker for hitting back aftera string of injuries. \n\"He's in the form that we need him to be in right now,\" said Foster. \n\"Over a career it's hard to say he's in his best form. \n\"But for someone who's gone through what he has to control the team in the way he does, it's outstanding. \n\"He's reaping the rewards of really hard work. \n\"To see him out there running around freely, it's outstanding.\" \nNew Zealand boss Hansen allayed injury fears over wing Nehe Milner-Skudder, before taking a swipe at Northern Hemisphere rugby. \n\"The Rugby Championship has been given a few smacks up this way recently, but we've shown tonight that it's a very physical competition,\" said Hansen. \n\"And that if you haven't got physicality you can't play.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:22:29.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
