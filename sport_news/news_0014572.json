The American fired a total of 22 aces during the match, which Murray won 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-4. The Scot managed to save all seven break points he faced. \nThe turning point came in the middle of the deciding set, when Murray broke his opponent in the seventh game. He then made the 2.08-meter American run around, and the latter even slipped while chasing a cross-court return. \nThough Isner managed to save the first match point in the ninth with one of his aces, Murray closed the set 6-4 on his next serve to end Isner’s attempt at becoming the first American to reach the quarterfinals in Shanghai since Andy Roddick in 2011. \n“It was a very tough first set. There was a lot of shadow across the court,” said Murray. “His serve is tough to read obviously. It’s hard to return in perfect conditions. Then when the sun went away, the court was played in the shade. I made some adjustments to my return position as well, which helped me.” \nThe 2010 and 2011 champion will next take on Tomas Berdych for a place in the semifinals after the Czech eased past Frenchman Gilles Simon 6-3, 6-3 in the night match. \nDjokovic was again one of the most efficient winners yesterday, the Serb needing just 71 minutes to see off Spaniard Feliciano Lopez with a 6-2, 6-3 scoreline — his 14th straight victory dating back to the US Open. \nThe Serb has a locker room of his own in Shanghai, the only one at the Masters events, and he was effusive in his praise of the tournament being played at the Qizhong Tennis Center in suburban Minhang District. \n“This is definitely one of the best Masters Series events in terms of organization, in terms of overall players’ experience. The only downside is literally the time that you spend in transportation from the city to the site.” \nHe obviously also enjoys a huge fan base in China. “Just tons of presents. One of the fans, I think he changed his name into Serbian. He can sing by heart the Serbian national anthem perfectly. That’s an effort I must say.” \nThe 2012 and 2013 champion will take on either Frenchman Richard Gasquet or Bernard Tomic of Australia next before a likely semifinal against Murray. \nNadal held a 5-1 head-to-head advantage over ninth-seeded Milos Raonic before their meeting yesterday. The Mallorcan won the first set 6-3 easily, but needed a 7-6 (3) tiebreak in the second to oust the Canadian. \n“Today I feel that I’m not playing with those nerves when I’m on court. I’m able to enjoy,” said the eighth seed, whose best performance in Shanghai was a runner-up finish in 2009. \nThe Spaniard will take on fourth-seeded Stanislas Wawrinka next after the French Open champion from Switzerland outlasted 14th-seeded Croat Marin Cilic 7-5, 6-7 (7), 6-4. \nEarlier, Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-7 (5), 7-5, 6-4. The Spanish qualifier had sent Roger Federer packing on Tuesday in the Swiss second-seed’s first match in Shanghai. \nTsonga’s quarterfinal opponent will be South African Anderson, who eliminated sixth-seeded Nishikori 7-6 (10), 7-6 (3). \n“It was tough match,” said the Japanese. “I think he served really well until the end. I didn’t have any chance for a break. But I thought I was playing well. It was good tennis for both of us.” \nIn doubles, the Colombian pair of Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah stunned top-seeded American brothers, Bob and Mike Bryan, 6-7 (1), 7-6 (7), 10-7 in a second-round clash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:24:47.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
