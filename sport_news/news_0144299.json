Recently, the Bruins president laughingly described the new scene he filmed. The characters played by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels pull into a drive-through fast food joint and one orders a vanilla milk shake, the other a chocolate.\nWhen the shakes are delivered, the one who ordered vanilla gets the chocolate, and the one who wanted chocolate is handed the vanilla. Rather than simply swap — they are, after all, total idiots — they get mad that the order is wrong and throw the shakes out the window.\nThe shakes land on the windshield of the truck behind them — driven by Sea Bass.\n“They really wanted to get Sea Bass into the movie,” said Neely. “I guess it didn’t make the cut.”\nWell, Neely may have been left out of this movie, but he will be very prominent in the Bruins’ picture this season and for years to come. The 50-year-old has served as team president since June of 2010, but that title was originally intended more as a community relations/goodwill ambassador sort of position than a hockey operations job.\nGeneral manager Peter Chiarelli was the guy who held the real power, with the final decision-making authority on hockey matters. Neely was always quite visible, and willing to express his opinions on the team, but, despite his credentials as one of the greats of the sport, had little sway.\nThat changed when Chiarelli was fired April 15, days after the B’s missed the playoffs. Don Sweeney would become the new GM and Neely suddenly was the team’s hockey czar.\n“It certainly is different,” said Neely recently. “Donny and I have had a lot of great conversations. It’s nice to be able to sit down and be comfortable talking about the team and the direction.”\nHaving dethroned Chiarelli in a very successful palace coup, No. 8 turns out to be a rather benevolent and rational monarch — interested more in sharing power than being a dictator.\n“There are a lot of good people in the organization who have good hockey minds,” said Neely. “Nobody is right all the time; it’s just not possible. You may think you’re right, but when you have multiple conversations maybe you realize, ‘I’m not looking at this properly.’ You see someone else’s opinion.\n“It’s all about communication. For me, (when) Don has ideas and thoughts, things he’d like to do, I want to know about it. When we went through the process interviewing candidates, a strong point of ours was the communication process.”\nFor Neely, after years on the management sideline, it’s a heck of a lot more fun being at the center of the team-building process.\n“Fun is a good word for it,” said Neely. “This is a game. We’re trying to accomplish winning Stanley Cups and that should be fun.\n“I love talking hockey. I love to have conversations, not just with Donny, but with (coach) Claude (Julien), with our scouts. For me the communication part is fun — talking about how we want to play, what types of players, how guys are playing, talking to the players, all of that is fun for me.\n“I don’t want to say it got to a point (in recent years) where it wasn’t fun. But it got to a point where you’d like to have more conversations and feel comfortable having them.”\nNeely reiterated that he does not want to be the de facto general manager with Sweeney in place mostly to do his bidding.\n“Well, being GM, that’s his job,” said Neely. “I mean, he comes to me and says, ‘This is what I want to do?’ I say, ‘Do you feel strongly about this? How strongly? Let’s have a conversation about it.’ If he feels strongly about doing something, I want him to be able to do it.\n“If I have someone come to me with thoughts and decisions on what they want to do and I said no to everything, what’s the point of having a GM?”\nSo now Neely wears the crown and has the right to say yes or no on all things Bruins. That’s quite different from before, when, like a fan, all he could do was watch and root.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:45:33.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
