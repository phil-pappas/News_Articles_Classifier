Their passing attack never really materialized or found a rhythm. Star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was kept in check. And the Giants still managed to win, 27-20 , at MetLife Stadium over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday afternoon. The Giants (4-3) claimed sole possession of first place in the NFC East by creating turnovers ... by scoring points on defense and special teams ... by winning the turnover battle ... by making a backup quarterback look, well, like a backup quarterback. Cowboys quarterback Matt Cassel threw three interceptions. \nHere's who was responsible for the good and the bad: \nSTUDS WR/KR Dwayne Harris This is why the Giants paid Harris this offseason. He can provide contributions on special teams and offense. His 100-yard kickoff return in the fourth quarter was the game-winning score and he contributed a 38-yard reception near the end of the first half that led to a Giants field goal. They were two huge, clutch plays, with the latter being the kind the Giants haven't made since winning the Super Bowl four seasons ago. \nCB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie With his partner Prince Amukamara out, the Giants have needed Rodgers-Cromartie to step up. He's doing exactly that. Rodgers-Cromartie had two interceptions on Sunday after injuring his finger, and returned one for a touchdown. Even if his celebration and high-stepping beginning at the 40-yard line didn't please coach Tom Coughlin, his ability to shut down wide receivers certainly did. RB Orleans Darkwa The Giants threw Darkwa into the game early in the second quarter and he rewarded their confidence with an eye-opening performance. Run for 7. Run for 9. Run for 10. Run for 15 and a touchdown. Wow. Impressive. He capped his day with a quality block on Harris' kickoff return for a touchdown. Honorable Mention: OT Ereck Flowers, WR Rueben Randle \nDUDS CB Jayron Hosley Amukamara's fill-in had his struggles, both in coverage and with his tackling. Hosley was also fortunate Cassel couldn't complete some passes to open receivers deep downfield or his evening could've been even worse. DT Johnathan Hankins The Giants allowed 223 yards rushing and Hankins is taking the bulk of the blame in this space because he's supposed to be their best interior lineman. He had four tackles but wasn't a real difference-maker despite being matched opposite Cowboys rookie lineman La'el Collins. In fact, Collins may have won that battle. OG Geoff Schwartz The Giants averaged 5.7 yards per carry and Schwartz was a big part of that. For the most part he was solid against the run, but Schwartz struggled again as a pass protector and allowed another sack. The Giants need a little better from their starting right guard. \nDE Greg Hardy (Cowboys) Usually, I refrain from including the opposition, but this is a special case. Hardy's actions were so ridiculous and absurd with him pushing coaches and teammates after the game that he had to be included on this list for his deplorable behavior. Some people just never seem to learn. Hardy is one of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:21:54.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
