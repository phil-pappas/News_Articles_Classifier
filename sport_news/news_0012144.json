Penn Yan is one of more than 2,000 high schools in the United States and eight countries to receive a golden football from the NFL, which is celebrating the 50th Super Bowl in 2016. High schools across the nation and around the world are receiving a commemorative Wilson Golden Football for every player or head coach who graduated from their school and was on an active Super Bowl roster. Nearly 3,000 players and head coaches will be recognized. The Super Bowl High School Honor Roll platform links the past 49 Super Bowls with this year’s game and honors the high schools and communities that have positively impacted the game of football. Before he presented the ball to Varsity Football Coach Dave Fauth, Collins addressed the students, reminding them of the power of their words, saying, “Think positive and speak positive,” he told the students. Fauth invited the entire varsity team to join him on stage, saying, “We do this together.” After presenting the ball to Fauth, Collins called quarterback Tanner Irwin out of the crowd of players to have him pass the ball across the stage to Collins. Collins, who has been inducted into the Penn Yan Academy Athletic Hall of Fame and the Section V Hall of Fame, played on the 1976 New York State Champion football team, and went on to play at East Carolina before being drafted in the second round by the New England Patriots. His single game rushing record (212 yards against the New York Jets in 1983) still stands in the Patriots record books. Collins also presented the ball to Academy Principal Dave Pullen and Athletic Director Tobin Tansey during the half time at the varsity football game against Geneva Friday evening. The NFL Foundation will provide the schools with a new character education curriculum and the opportunity to apply for grants of up to $5,000 to help support and grow their football programs. The NFL Foundation has invested $1 million towards the campaign. Penn Yan Superintendent Howard Dennis says the district will be applying for one of the grants.
