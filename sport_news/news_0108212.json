It also ranks as the top Game 1 of an NLDS since Dodgers/Cubs in 2008 (3.5, 5.4M). \nThe game had a 27.8 rating in St. Louis, up 58% from last year’s Cardinals/Dodgers Game 1 on FS1 (17.6) and the highest for a Division Series opener in the market since at least 1998 (12 telecasts). It also had a 16.8 in Chicago, a 23% drop from Wednesday’s Wild Card game against the Pirates (21.8). \nGame 1 of the Mets/Dodgers series drew a 3.0 and 4.7 million later in the night, up 36% in ratings and 38% in viewership from Royals/Angels Game 2 last year (2.2, 3.4M) and up 25% and 32%, respectively, from Tigers/Athletics Game 1 in 2013 (2.4, 3.6M). \nThe Mets’ win earned a 10.1 rating in New York, the team’s highest in the market since 2012. In Los Angeles, it had an 8.1 rating — up 14% from last year’s previously mentioned Cardinals/Dodgers opener on FS1 (7.1). \nIncluding the N.L. Wild Card Game, TBS has averaged a 3.7 and 6.1 million for the MLB Postseason thus far — up 28% in ratings and 36% in viewership from last year. Friday’s doubleheader in particular averaged 5.0 million viewers, the highest average for Turner Sports’ first day of Division Series coverage since it began airing playoff games in 2007. \n(Fri. numbers from Turner Sports) Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:15:51.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
