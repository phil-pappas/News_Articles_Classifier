Chris Kreider, Keith Yandle and Rick Nash also scored goals for New York. Nash's goal was his 700th career point. Mats Zuccarello added two assists. Klas Dahlbeck scored for Arizona. The Coyotes have lost four in a row after opening the season 3-0. Mike Smith made 24 saves for Arizona. Hayes broke a 1-1 tie with his second goal of the season at 2:35 of the third period. Smith turned the puck over to J.T. Miller trying to play the puck behind the goal line. Miller found Hayes along the goal line, and the second year center lifted a backhand into the net. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
