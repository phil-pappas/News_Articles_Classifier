Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich on Tuesday also vouched for Pitino , saying the coach had a long-term contract with the university and had no plans to step down.\nU of L, the NCAA and local authorities are investigating allegations in a recent book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules,\" in which escort Katina Powell claims a former Louisville staffer paid her and other escorts, including her own teenage daughters, thousands of dollars and gave them game tickets in exchange for dancing for and having sex with players and recruits.\nThe former staffer, Andre McGee, has acknowledged through his lawyer, Scott C. Cox, that he knows Powell but also denied paying anyone for sex. Pitino, in multiple comments over the past few weeks, has said if any of the alleged activities were going on, he did not know about them.\n\"I'm sorry we all have to endure the pain of these allegations,\" Pitino wrote to begin his post. \"I so appreciate your support and friendships.\n\"I will not resign and let you down. Someday I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years, but that time is not now. I do not fight these accusations by others, but rather turn the other cheek. Couldn't do it at 33, but at 63, it's the wise thing to do. Let's let the investigators do their job and we will play basketball.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nStudent sues for profits from Powell book\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nLouisville President James Ramsey: No discussions about basketball coach Rick Pitino resigning\nThe comments reiterate what Pitino said in the days following the initial release of the book, when he told radio host Terry Meiners that resigning would be \"the cowardly thing\" to do.\nToward the end of his post, Pitino touched on the pope's recent visit to the United States and tied it back to U of L's current situation.\n\"The pope on his recent visit was asked many controversial questions,\" Pitino wrote. \"He would often answer, 'We will let God judge.' There can be no better advice, regardless of what religion you are, than his words. Let's not try to justify, but let the Lord judge.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nSullivan | Readers divided on Pitino's fate\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nFollow U of L sports on Cards HQ app", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3faf0c4e341022d95ff4b34e5c0c7d8a44cafa4b/c=0-65-258-323/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Louisville/Louisville/635794900559720767-book-cover.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eee3bc26f03c9f34c33f2158a59346a6dc4526e6/c=0-105-484-378&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/29/Louisville/Louisville/635791402716047261-cardshq.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/823e1ca389d1f9de8d7ee279ca120efe1dac0461/c=0-203-1764-1200&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Louisville/Louisville/635800298950097466-USATSI-8245872.jpg", "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/tim-sullivan/2015/10/22/sullivan-readers-divided-pitinos-fate/74384492/?from=global&sessionKey=&autologin=", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/35e6f0750e0b238469451c4ecdf4f2b62b862a12/c=0-126-264-274&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/21/Louisville/B9318945637Z.1_20150921142501_000_G6DC0EPJR.1-0.jpg", "http://rickpitino.net/2015/10/2015-2016-season-preview/", "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2015/10/21/ramsey-no-discussions-pitino-resigning/74338888/?from=global&sessionKey=&autologin=", "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2015/10/22/student-sues-profits-powell-book/74400594/", "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2015/10/09/follow-u-l-sports-cards-hq-app/73661150/?from=global&sessionKey=&autologin="], "published": "2015-10-23T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:11:39.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
