The Bearcats and Pioneers, both at 5-0, will square off in Kinnikinnick, Friday night. (Photo: Gazette file photo) \nHillsboro (1-4) at Chillicothe (3-2) \n•In 2014: Chillicothe 48-0. \n•Last week: The Cavaliers defeated Miami Trace 45-14; the Indians lost 49-7 to Wilmington. \n•Outlook: In the past two seasons, Chillicothe has won this meeting by scores of 49-0 and 48-0. All-time, the Cavaliers are 17-2-2 against Hillsboro. The point in those numbers? Things have went the Cavaliers’ way against the Indians and will continue to do so come Friday night. Senior running back Nate Rosenbauer has been a huge asset to the Cavs’ offensive attack with 241 yards rushing in Week 6 and 175 the week before. Quarterback Jack Busch is also coming into his own and is hitting a stride at the right point in the season. Look for the Cavaliers to cruise to their fourth win this season against the Indians, further solidifying themselves as playoff worthy. \nPaint Valley (5-0) at Zane Trace (5-0) \n•In 2014: Paint Valley won 41-14. \n•Last week: The Bearcats defeated Unioto 42-7, the Pioneers defeated Southeastern 48-0. \n•Outlook: If you’re not busy Friday night and need something to do, this is most definitely your chance to catch one heck of a football game. If the stars align like they should, football fans in Kinnikinnick should be treated to one of the best games all season long. Paint Valley will come into this game as the AP’s fifth ranked team in Division VI while Zane Trace enters as the AP’s fourth ranked team in Divison V. The match-up will see two great quarterbacks, two great running backs, two great offensive lines and two great coaches go toe to toe for 48 minutes. There’s not much more you can ask for. Oh yeah, there’s also the small matter of a probable SVC championship on the line. \nHuntington (0-5) at Adena (3-2) \n•In 2014: Huntington won 44-32. \n•Last week: The Huntsmen lost 57-54 to Westfall in triple overtime; the Warriors defeated Piketon 47-12. \n•Outlook: In what was supposed to be a close match-up last week, Adena took care of Piketon — handily — by a final of 47-12. More of the same could be expected in Week 6 as the Warriors and their talented ground game get set to host Huntington. After the Huntsmen gave up 57 points to a Westfall team that’s averaging just 18.4, that can’t be too far fetched of a prediction. However, this is no prediction: Adena’s Cale Free will come into the match-up leading the area in rushing yards (726). When combined with fellow running back Isaac Thomas’ mark of 406 rushing yards in 2015, Huntsmen fans have to be seeing the obvious here. Paul Thomas’ crew will do their usual ground and pound and if all goes as expected, it should propel them to their fourth win of the season. \nPiketon (2-3) at Westfall (1-4) \n•In 2014: Westfall won 20-8. \n•Last week: The Redstreaks lost 47-12 to Adena; the Mustangs defeated Huntington 57-54 in triple overtime. \n•Outlook: Just a week ago, some were looking at Piketon as being a dark horse spoiler team. Now, after taking one on the chin, all conversation about the Redstreaks has shifted to how they will respond. On the other hand, Westfall is coming off its first win of the season in a triple overtime thriller over Huntington. The same ‘how will they respond’ question could be asked here as well. In a game between two teams who are seeming to have identity crises, this one could be a toss-up. \nUnioto (2-3) at Southeastern (1-4) \n•In 2014: Unioto won 44-7. \n•Last week: The Shermans lost 42-7 to Paint Valley; the Panthers lost 48-0 to Zane Trace. \n•Outlook: My how the mighty have fallen. After a 2-0 start to the season, Unioto has now lost three straight games and has been outscored 121-20 during that wretched stretch. Southeastern has been on a wretched stretch for close to two years now, being 1-14 in their last 15 contests. Some would say this is yet another toss-up. However, if the Shermans’ duo of Erique Hosley and Clay Edler can get going, Unioto is still the favorite. On paper, the Tanks do have more talent but the Panthers have nothing to lose and teams with nothing to lose are the most dangerous types of teams. \nLucasville Valley (5-0) at Waverly (3-2) \n•In 2014: Lucasville Valley won 48-21. \n•Last week: The Tigers lost 46-13 to Caldwell; the Indians defeated East 55-15. \n•Outlook: Here’s a fact: Lucasville Valley is currently the top ranked team, in terms of computer points, in Division VI, Region 21 — just ahead of Paint Valley. Friday night is Waverly’s chance to knock them right out of that position. There are also many scenarios that are in the Tigers’ favor; such as Valley traveling to Waverly, the Tigers are very familiar with their opponent and are hungry for a win after a Week 5 loss. No matter the outcome, we know two things for sure: Lucasville Valley is a proven playoff contender while Waverly has, so far, been a playoff pretender. Week 6 should tell us more and reveal the true identity of the Waverly Tigers. \ndwebb@chillicothegazette.com \nTwitter: @dw1509 \nFollow the Chillicothe Gazette’s live game updates from Paint Valley at Zane Trace (@dw1509), Hillsboro at Chillicothe (@MrZacharyMax) and Unioto at Southeastern, Friday night on Twitter at hashtag #cghss .
