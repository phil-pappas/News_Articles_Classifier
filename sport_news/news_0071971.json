Wisconsin takes 23-21 lead on Nebraska, which leads all of college football in shattered souls among its fan base. — Pete Thamel (@SIPeteThamel) October 10, 2015 \nA week ago, Badgers quarterback Joel Stave was getting slammed by the team's own recruits. On Saturday, he was being praised for engineering the final drive. Rafael Gaglianone hit the game winner, but QB Joel Stave was the difference maker for the #Badgers over Nebraska http://t.co/aWjXh25wyF — Benjamin Worgull (@TheBadgerNation) October 11, 2015 \nThe Wisconsin State Journal's Jim Polzin noted that Stave might have had a chance to do the same thing four years ago on the same Nebraska field , but then-Badgers coach Bret Bielema put Danny O'Brien in the game to lead the two-minute offense. The Badgers lost that game after O'Brien fumbled a handoff to Montee Ball. \nHere's some of the reaction to Saturday's game: \n• From ESPN's Sherman : \"The Badgers stay alive in the race for the West. But Wisconsin needs Iowa to lose twice, barring a tie at the top of more than two teams. That's way down the road for this team, which added (running back Taiwan) Deal on Saturday to its long list of injured offensive players.\" \n• From Sports Illustrated's Andy Staples , a video in which he calls Gaglianone \"potentially the greatest Brazilian, large, dancing placekicker in college football history. He's all those things.\" Might have been a season-saving win for Wisconsin, though the Badgers still have major issues on offense — Brian Bennett (@BennettESPN) October 10, 2015 \n• From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Jeff Potrykus : \"What is obvious just two weeks into Big Ten Conference play is that Wisconsin's offense lacks playmakers and will have to grind for every first down and every point this season. Yet what also became obvious from Wisconsin's remarkable 23-21 victory over Nebraska on Saturday afternoon at Memorial Stadium is that Paul Chryst's team is built to go 15 rounds with most of the teams in the West Division.\" \n• From the Lincoln Journal Star's Brian Christopherson, on the Nebraska viewpoint : \"The whole thing's become something else at this point: eerie. A Yogi-ism seems fair right about now. It's deja vu all over again.\" \n• From the Lincoln Journal Star's Shea Carlson : \"Instant redemption seems almost like an oxymoron. Usually it takes months or years to earn vindication, but in Wisconsin kicker Rafael Gaglianone’s world, it came only moments later.\" Todd D. Milewski \nTodd D.
