His new basketball team at McKinley High School, the result of a merger between Timken and McKinley, is going to be loaded. Hairston isn’t shying away from that. He also wants you to know what else he has been hearing, too. Jackson, Lake, Perry, GlenOak and Hoover will be loaded as well. ‘The thing is, I think we’ll be as talented a team as I’ve ever had,” Hairston said. “But when you look around Stark County, the county is about as loaded as it’s ever been. You look at Jackson, Lake, GlenOak, Perry, and I hear the reason Hoover’s football team is struggling a little bit is all the best athletes are in the gym. Those teams are loaded, too.” Basketball practice, with hands-on coaching, doesn’t start until Oct. 30 by Ohio High School Athletic Association rules. Right now, teams have organized weight rooms and training, and Hairston’s McKinley team has open gyms on Sundays. He is looking at a team with the likelihood of at least three Division I players: • Jordan Davis has committed to play at the University of Akron. • LePear Toles, who is moonlighting as McKinley football team’s best receiver, will have his pick of Mid-American Conference offers. • Darryl Straughter is a junior guard who Hairston thinks can play Division I basketball as well. “He’s the best looking guard I’ve seen in a long time,” Hairston said of Straughter. “He hasn’t gotten a lot of offers yet, but I’m sure after he has a great junior year, those will come pouring in for him.” The merger of the two schools has not been an issue, and Hairston doesn’t believe it will become one, either. He points out that most of his players began playing either with or against one another in the same youth leagues in elementary school. “They only became disconnected in the ninth grade,” Hairston said. “All we’re doing now is reconnecting them.” McKinley’s hoops offseason schedule started 30 days after the tournament last season. They lifted three days a week for the players not playing baseball or running track. In June, the team worked out twice a week for 31⁄2 hours and played in summer leagues two nights a week. Players were off Fridays in June, and then attended four shootouts on Saturdays. “Then the football guys in July went to football, and our high-level guys went with their AAU teams around the country,” Hairston said. “I think all our bonding was done playing together in the summer. Page 2 of 4 - “The kids know each other. I think we’re good. We’re not trying to trick anyone. They grew up and played together. They all know each other. They’re not strangers.” TOUGH CUTS The toughest part of Hairston’s job will be making cuts. His varsity team will go 15 players deep and, he admitted, some kids who would have made the teams at McKinley and Timken before won’t make this team. He will have two freshman teams, a junior varsity and varsity. That means there will be roughly 60 spots among the four teams. “I think we have a couple of Division I guys in Straughter and Toles. We have a Division I post player in Jordan Davis,” Hairston said. “Isiah Smith and Dom Robinson are a couple of 6-5, 220-pound studs. We have a plethora of guards that I don’t want to single any one out.” Hairston believes his bench will go deep. All 15 players who make the team will contribute. “Cuts have to be made and some people are going to be upset,” Hairston said. “We’re going to keep all good character kids. In the past, maybe you would give a kid a chance to help him out. Now, character will really count. We’re going to have to make some tough calls, but that’s the situation.” TOLES SHOOTING While he is spending most of his time with the football team, Toles is starting to look at basketball again. He has been in the gym shooting a little bit, Hairston said. DISTRICT TOURNAMENT CHANGES The last two years the Northeast District Athletic Board allowed teams in the northeast district of the OHSAA to choose between two district tournaments. In Stark County, it was a chance for two teams to get out of the district and into the regional tournament. The district board voted two weeks ago to eliminate that practice. It now means that all the Stark County teams will fall into the Division I sectional-district tournament here and not be able to enter the Copley District. There are pros and cons to the move. Hairston points out his Timken team was eliminated by Medina last year because, in part, he wasn’t as familiar with Medina as he should have been. “Now, you know what you’re getting from Tommy McBride’s Lake team in the tournament,” Hairston said. He also pointed out, it should help eliminate some shady seeding practices. “Last year, take Wooster for example,” Hairston said. “They voted us the No. 8 seed and never had a chance to see us play. We had the third-best record. Wooster votes us the eight seed and when it was time for them to go on the board to either go on the line across from us, or the line against the team Wooster voted No. 2, they chose to play the second seed. Page 3 of 4 - If he thinks we were No. 8, why didn’t he play us instead of choosing to play No. 2? I didn’t think the seeding voting was fair.” Now, the problem will be particularly with Federal League teams having to play — and possibly beat — a team three times (twice during the league, and once in the tournament) to get to the regional. TOP FIVE IN FOOTBALL While there still are two weeks of high school football to play, it is pretty evident which are the top five teams in the county. Some may debate the arrangement, but it is hard to argue not including any of the following five teams. In order, with two weeks left to play, here are my top five: • No. 5, Sandy Valley: The only loss came against Ridgewood, which is unbeaten in the Inter-Valley Conference. The Cardinals are in prime position to make the playoffs, and that would be a first in school history. • No. 4, Central Catholic: The Crusaders haven’t had as easy of a time with it this year as they did last year, but the two losses were quality losses. Central is in the driver’s seat to host a playoff game. That starts this week against Lake, though. • No. 3, Louisville: Lots of playoff and league marbles are in the circle this week against unbeaten Salem. A win puts the Leopards in line to host a playoff game. • No. 2, Perry: Who predicted the Federal League would come down to a Week 10 game between the Panthers and GlenOak? Providing Perry doesn’t trip up against Jackson and the Golden Eagles navigate an upset against Hoover, the league title will be decided in Week 10. • No. 1, GlenOak: The Golden Eagles have been the county’s most consistent team all season. Scott Garcia has turned this program into one to model, and as long as he’s turning out 300-pounders on the offensive line, who can stop this offense? CHANGES The last top five about a month ago looked like this: 5, Sandy Valley; 4, Louisville; 3, McKinley; 2, Perry; 1, GlenOak. That means McKinley dropped out. The Bulldogs have had moments when they looked solid with goal-line stands to win games against Lake and Jackson, and then complete meltdowns against Perry (41-0) and Hoban (49-0). CROWN ’EM? Hoban. by the way. is unbeaten and hasn’t really been in a game yet this season. Of those eight wins, four have been shutouts, and three others the opposing offense scored just seven points. The Knights have outscored opponents 302-29. The team that scored the most points on the Knights? Woodward with eight.
