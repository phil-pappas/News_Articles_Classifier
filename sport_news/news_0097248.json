It’ll be the 5-2 Matoaca Warriors coming to town to face the 5-2 Blue Devils. In watching the film, Matoaca Football head coach Derrick Johnson said he was really amazed at the coaching that was displayed by Hopewell. He pointed to the Blue Devils' multi-front defense and the athleticism of Hopewell quarterback Cameren Hill. Hopewell Football head coach Ricky Irby pointed to Matoaca's weapons on offense and their aggressive defense. “We’re going to definitely have to play well to win,” Irby said. “They’ve got some playmakers, no doubt.” “It’s going be a good one,” Johnson said. “We’re both 5-2, both very athletic programs.” Matoaca is looking to get back on track and finish the season strong. They’re coming off a 21-14 upset loss on Homecoming to the visiting Meadowbrook. The Hopewell Blue Devils came out of their Homecoming game victorious over visiting Colonial Heights 47-14. Irby said they were able to somewhat neutralize the Colonials’ primary running threat Darien Canada as well as capitalize on the visitors' mistakes. He added that the Blue Devils had good field position for most of the game. The Blue Devils’ seven touchdowns were scored by seven different players - Ronnie Monroe off of a pass from Cameren Hill, Jarey Allen on the interception return TD and five rushing scores by Nas Cooper, Ronnie Walker, Anthony Crawford, Jacob Rockwell and Reggie Jones. “It all starts up front. Any coach will tell you that being successful starts with a good offensive line and a good defensive line and we were able to open up some holes for those guys and they ran the ball hard for us all night and they have been for the last several weeks and really all season,” Irby said. “But really, the last few weeks, we’ve been able to establish our running game and it’s been very crucial for us.” Irby added of the seven different scorers last Friday night: “The versatility there is definitely a plus. You focus on one guy, we’ve got other guys that can step in and make plays.” Johnson noted that Matoaca needed to continue enhancing their offense while also striving towards their goals in all phases of the game. Johnson said they have a goal board, and every day of the week, they go over their goals. Last week, he said, of the eight goals for each group, the team achieved roughly two on offense, two on defense and roughly four on special teams. “The last time we lost [against Manchester], that was the same type of data we had, so we definitely have measurable goals we look at on a weekly basis, and the kids know. They know,” Johnson said. “That game [against Meadowbrook], we did some uncharacteristic things in that game and you’ve got to stay on. You can’t turn off.” Johnson also pointed out that the lull of Homecoming - or “distraction city” as he also called it - came into play. He stressed the necessity of taking care of the little things, which his team strives to pride itself on. Against the multi-talented Blue Devils, Johnson said he's hoping that the team’s efficiency steps up to 70 percent. As of now, he noted, they’ve been playing at about 60 percent efficiency what with the injury bug sneaking up on them. Injured players include Zack Cunningham, who broke his foot two to three weeks ago. As a result, Matoaca has had to make adjustments on the secondary. Johnson said they have yet to discover a full lineup due to the adversity through which they’ve been working this season. With three games left in the regular stretch, Hopewell's Irby said his Blue Devils are trying to take it one game at a time as they aim to put themselves in good position for the 3A playoffs. He also pointed to the team doing what they can this week to try and neutralize some of the weapons that Matoaca has on offense while also trying to figure out some of the ways they can best attack their defense. As they ready their game plan, Irby is looking forward to playing Friday night at Merner Field, as is Johnson, who spoke to both the Matoaca and Hopewell communities’ passion for the sport. “Going to Hopewell Stadium with all the history - I know some close friends whose parents went to Hopewell, and just to be in that facility with all the rich history between these two programs - both communities, man, they’re just blue collar communities that just love football,” Johnson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:20:22.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
