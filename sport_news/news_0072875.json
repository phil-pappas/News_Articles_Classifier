Venus Williams: American claims... \nThe Bob Feller Act of Valor Award Foundation announced the winners Friday. \nThe honorees also include Milwaukee Brewers catcher Jonathan Lucroy, Chief Petty Officer Genell Cody of the U.S. Navy, Staff Sgt. Rene Segura of the U.S. Marines, USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) and the Hopper Information Services Center. \n\"Wow, what an honor,\" Brett, the legendary Kansas City Royals third baseman, said regarding the award. \"I am constantly amazed at the work service men and women do for our country. To be recognized in the name of Bob Feller and to meet some outstanding members of the Navy is truly special.\" \nBrett regularly shows support for the men and women who serve America through participation in the \"Military Day\" of the Royals Caravan, visiting service members at bases and veteran hospitals throughout Missouri and Kansas. On the trips, Brett meets and signs autographs for active duty military members, as well as participates in ceremonies welcoming home deployed troops at Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth Army Bases in Kansas and Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. \nBrett also has shown support for veterans undergoing treatment through visits to the Kansas City VA Medical Center. He joined the Royals and Major League Baseball to announce renovations at the hospital's Honor Annex as part of the 2012 MLB All-Star Game Legacy projects. \nLucroy has supported the troops for many years, including working with Fisher House Wisconsin, inviting wounded heroes to home games each month as his guest and giving more than $20,000 in scholarships to military families. \n\"I'm very grateful, honored and humbled to be recognized for my support. I appreciate the men and women who sacrifice their lives for our country,\" Lucroy said in a statement. \nDuring the 2014 offseason, Lucroy joined veterans on the Honor Flight, traveling with 41 WW II and Korean War veterans to Washington D.C. \nBrett, Lucroy, Cody and Segura are scheduled to attend the awards ceremony at the U.S. Navy Memorial in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 4. \nFeller was a pitcher for the Cleveland Indians from 1936 to 1956, frequently leading the American League in strikeouts and games won. He was the first 20th-century pitcher to pitch three no-hitters (1940, 1946, 1951), and his record of 348 season strikeouts (1946) stood for 19 years. He ended his career with a record of 266-162. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1962. \nFeller enlisted in the U.S. Navy just days after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Feller served on missions in both the Pacific and the North Atlantic, and earned the rank of chief petty officer along with six campaign ribbons and eight battle stars. When asked about the most important game he had won, Feller famously replied without hesitation, \"World War II.\" \nIncluding Lucroy, other MLB players named finalists for the 2015 Bob Feller Act of Valor Award were Darren O'Day, Baltimore Orioles; Ian Kennedy, San Diego Padres; Brian Dozier, Minnesota Twins; Wade Davis, Kansas City Royals; Steve Cishek, St. Louis Cardinals; Trevor Bauer, Cleveland Indians; Curtis Granderson, New York Mets; Jay Bruce, Cincinnati Reds; Sean Doolittle, Oakland A's; Adam LaRoche, Chicago White Sox; Craig Stammen, Washington Nationals; Charlie Morton, Pittsburgh Pirates; Dustin Pedroia, Boston Red Sox; and Brad Ziegler, Arizona Diamondbacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:24:48.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
