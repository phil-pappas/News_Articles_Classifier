And why wouldn’t they be excited?\nNext stop: the World Series.\nWhen they open play Tuesday night in Kansas City against the American League champion Royals, the Mets begin the quest for their first championship since 1986, to recapture a time when this team owned the city, when the Yankees were mediocre and the powerful young arms in Queens were the ones grabbing headlines.\nAnd while some of this feels familiar — who in baseball wouldn’t covet the Mets’ young, talented pitching staff the way the sport once did for the likes of Dwight Gooden, Ron Darling and Sid Fernandez? — this 2015 team has carved a personality all its own, one cast in the shadow of a tireless manager, built on camaraderie in the clubhouse and born of boundless enthusiasm. And if it only feels like the entire New York/New Jersey fan base is cramming for space on the bandwagon, this week opens the door for the rest of the country to get to know this team, too.\nA quick look at some of what they will learn tells you why the Mets’ popularity quotient is likely to rise.\nWelcome to Murph-tober \nOf all the unlikely numbers to emerge from the Mets’ five-game disposal of the Los Angeles Dodgers (National League Division Series) and four-game sweep of the Chicago Cubs (National League Championship Series), nothing is more mind-boggling than the power surge by second baseman Daniel Murphy. If the player himself was left admitting over and over again, “I can’t explain it,” how are we to?\nChalk it up to the hottest of hot streaks at the biggest of big moments, to a player so locked in at the plate that no pitch is too low or inside to hit out of the park, no baserunning risk too great to attempt, no scorching line drive too hot to glove.\nThe hitting has been the thing. Murphy has homered in the last six playoff games, a major league record, and has seven postseason homers overall.\nThat’s half — HALF — his regular-season total. In nine games. One more and he ties the record for most playoff home runs in a single postseason (shared by Barry Bonds, Nelson Cruz and Carlos Beltran).\nThe masterful manager \nTerry Collins is easy to root for. At 66, he is the game’s oldest manager, a throwback to a time when skippers worked their way up through the minors, honing their skills across tiny towns and desert stops, long bus rides and short motel stays.\nBut rather than being stuck to the past, Collins has been a study in growth, learning from his own mistakes and dialing back on his intensity, to a point now where he is beloved and respected by his players.\nClose to the firing line more than once in his Mets tenure, Collins made the organizational faith pay off and reduced himself to a near-quivering mess when the magnitude of what he’d accomplished set in.\n“Baseball has been my life, my whole life,” the manager said in the hours after the NLCS win. “I was one of those guys that started ¬playing when he was 4 or 5. And I told a ¬|story tonight to some people that tonight, this day [Oct. 21] would have been my mom and dad’s wedding anniversary, had they been alive.”\nThe veteran captain \nDavid Wright, sometimes known around here as Captain America, has steered this ship through some lean times, guiding it out of the devastation of the 2006 Game 7 loss in the NLCS, through the Bernie Madoff-induced paucity, to this amazing playoff run. In an appearance on the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” show, alongside teammates Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Wilmer Flores, Wright explained his reasoning for never wearing goggles in Champagne celebrations.\n“You’ve got to earn the burn,” he said.\nNo one has earned it more than he has, though assists should go to Curtis Granderson and Michael Cuddyer, two veterans who held the clubhouse together while Wright was shelved by a back injury. Cuddyer, the big off-season free-agent acquisition, is no longer a starting outfielder, but by moves like instituting the postgame belt award to the player of the game, he has contributed plenty.\nRest of the nickname patrol \nLet’s be honest — the Mets have some great nicknames floating around their locker room, a credit to the big personalities and big arms that  stock their pitching staff. DeGrom is “The deGrominator,” a terminator on the mound whose trademark flowing brown locks give him a memorable look. Fellow starter Noah Syndergaard also sports a full head of flowing long hair, in shiny blond, and has earned him the nickname “Thor.” A devoted fan of Nordic mythology, Syndergaard names his baseball gloves, and is currently relying on his “Thor” model.\n“Pretty self-explanatory there,” he said in advance of his start against L.A.\nAnd then there’s Harvey, the highest-profile member of the staff, the former No. 1 pick whose highs (domination in Game 1 of the NLCS) and lows (innings limits, missed workout) have been well chronicled. But with one response to Collins — “Damn right,” when asked if he wanted the ball for Tuesday’s Game 1 start — Harvey reminds us why he is, indeed, “The Dark Knight.”\nAmerica’s shortstop \nFlores wasn’t even supposed to start much this postseason, but after Chase Utley broke Ruben Tejada’s leg with a slide heard ’round the baseball world, Flores moved up. And if |so many of his Mets teammates personify youthful exuberance, Flores represents the team’s heart, the reminder that these guys are human, with emotions and feelings like the rest of us.\nWho can forget the sight of Flores wiping away tears while he stood on the field that July 29 night when he was heartbroken by the prospect of being traded to the Brewers, dealt from the team that had signed him out of Venezuela as a teenager?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:39:22.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
