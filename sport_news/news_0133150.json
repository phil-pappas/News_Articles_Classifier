Arizona State has won 11 straight in the series, tied for the longest active winning streak by one Pac-12 team over another with USC over Cal and Oregon over Washington (the Ducks and Huskies also play this week). \nThe last two matchups have come down to the wire, with Arizona State taking the lead on a Taylor Kelly TD pass with 2:37 to go in a 20-19 win in 2013, and kicker Zane Gonzalez making a 36-yard field goal in overtime to win 19-16 in 2014. \n\nUtah's defense caused what might be the best quarterback in college football this season to throw five interceptions last week. But the Pac-12 gauntlet continues, with Arizona State's high octane offense coming to town. \nThe Sun Devils have scored first in 33 of the 46 games under Todd Graham and are currently 4-0 when scoring first this season (7-1 when scoring first last season). Not only do they like to strike first, they also like to strike fast. Of Arizona State's 30 scoring drives this season, 22 (73 percent) have come in under three minutes or less. \n\nArizona State plays a very aggresive style of defense. The Sun Devils are averaging 3.17 sacks (No. 11 NCAA, No. 1 Pac-12) per game and are No. 4 in the country in tackles for loss per game with 9.33. \nUtah is one of the best teams in the country at protecting its quarterback, surrendering only two sacks on the season (No. 3 NCAA, No. 1 Pac-12). \n\nThe Sun Devils have been stout against the run, especially over the last two games. UCLA only averaged 2.21 yards per run against ASU, while Colorado was even worse at 1.75. Arizona State is holding opponents to 138.8 yards per game on the season, but an astonishingly low 62.3 over their last three games. \nUnlike any of the previous games the Utes had played this season, Devontae Booker was the sole option for the offense. Booker picked up 222 yards on the ground and added another 45 through the air for a total of 267, the most yards from scrimmage for any player against a ranked opponent this season. Booker is averaging 133 yards per game rushing. \n\nUtah has never trailed going into the fourth quarter. In fact, Utah has only trailed twice all season — 3-0 early in the game against Fresno State, and 7-3 in the first quarter against Cal. \nWith a lead late in games, the Utes have taken the air out of the football by controlling the clock and keeping the ball on the ground. Travis Wilson's pass attempts by quarter: 32, 39, 23 and 7. The first-down conversion rate on those passing attempts: 28 percent (9/32), 33 percent (13/39), 35 percent (8/23) and 14 percent (1/7). The yardage per quarter: 184, 302, 170 and 27. \nLas \nWith Utah's 30-24 win over Cal, the Utes are now the only undefeated team in the Pac-12. On top of that, all but Utah and Stanford have at least one conference loss as well. The Utes won't play the Cardinal this season, unless they match up against each other in the Pac-12 championship game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:51:39.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
