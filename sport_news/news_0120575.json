(Image Source: Leon Helip/Getty Images) \nWeek 7 game of the week: \n(7) Michigan State at (12) Michigan – 3:30 on ESPN \nThe Michigan State Spartans have won six of the past seven games in this in-state rivalry and they are getting points despite being the seventh ranked team in the nation. Despite my respect for Mark Dantonio’s program and the recent success they have had against the Wolverines, this is clearly a different University of Michigan program. \nSince their opening week defeat at Utah (a loss that is looking far better than we expected), Michigan has obliterated every opponent that has stood in their way. They drilled Oregon State and UNLV and then shutout BYU, Maryland and Northwestern. This is the first time since 1995 that any FBS school has shutout three straight opponents. On the whole, the defense is performing at a historic level. The Wolverines are ranked as the top defense in the country and they are giving up only 6.3 points per game. Michigan’s defense is surrendering only 181 yards per game and they are ranked in the top five in every significant defensive category. Linebackers Desmond Morgan and Joe Bolden lead the unit and the secondary has a pair of elite players in Jabrill Peppers and Jourdan Lewis . It’s incredibly tough for opponents to attack this defense because there is absolutely no discernible weakness to exploit. \nMeanwhile, the offense gets better each week. Michigan is running the ball successfully behind an improved offensive line that has clearly heard Harbaugh’s message to get physical. The Wolverines are spreading the carries around as four different running backs have more than 25 carries on the season. De’Veon Smith is the best of the bunch and I’m hopeful he’ll be 100% for Saturday’s clash against MSU. Ty Isaac is averaging 7.1 yards per carry and Drake Johnson is averaging 4.9 yards per carry to provide high-quality backup carries. Jake Rudock has only had one turnover in the past three weeks and he appears to be getting quite comfortable in the offensive system. Ideally, there would be a few more explosive plays in the passing game because I do think Amara Darboh , Jake Butt and Jehu Chesson are very capable weapons but for now, efficiency and mistake-free football is getting the job done. \nThe Spartans come into this matchup unbeaten but I’m uncertain of how good they are. Their marquee win this season is a narrow home victory over Oregon. That looked great in Week 2 but the Ducks have faltered on multiple occasions since and the Spartans have stumbled their way through underwhelming performances against Air Force, Central Michigan, Purdue and Rutgers. When the whole season is taken into account, Michigan State is only outscoring their opponents by an average of ten points (31.3-21.3) and they’ve been outgained in three of their six games. I think Michigan State is a good team but I don’t think they are an elite team and it’s going to take an elite squad to win in Ann Arbor. Michigan State has given up more than 140 rushing yards to three different opponents and I think Michigan will be able to run the ball successfully, particularly if De’Veon Smith is completely healthy. I also think the Wolverines will be able to control the clock and keep Connor Cook and his big play receiver Aaron Burbridge from burning them. \nTo Read More From Sammy Jacobs, TJ Inman & Nick Holmes of HoosierHuddle.com , click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:19:36.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
