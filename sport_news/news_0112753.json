It seems he wants a clean sweep.\nHead coach Greg Vanney admitted Wednesday night his top scorer is desperate to win his year’s Golden Boot award, too. In terms of the regular season, it’s all Giovinco has left to do.\nAt the moment, the Atomic Ant is level on goals (22) with the Crew’s Kei Kamara with two matches remaining.\n“You want to play against the best, you want to compete against the best,” Crew attacker Ethan Finlay told his club’s official website.\n“So for (Kamara) to be able to go up and play against (Giovinco), it’s a battle. As a team, we will try to shut Giovinco down and hope we can reward our big man.”\nAll the while the Reds will attempt to do the same at the opposite end, where Kamara will be looking to get on the end of any ball flighted into the box.\n“Kei is a very dangerous forward, especially when they’re able to get balls out wide and whip balls into the box,” Vanney said. “We can’t allow him the freedom to run in the box and out jump us.”\nThe game inside the game Saturday afternoon will feature the league’s leading goal-scorers facing off in a match filled with playoff implications.\nToronto FC (49 points) could lock up a first-round playoff bye if it wins a fifth straight game this weekend.\nThe Crew (47 points), meanwhile, will jump up ahead of TFC if they knock off the Reds at BMO Field, where TFC boasts an impressive 11-4-1 record this season.\nWhile TFC remains solidly in second place behind New York Red Bulls (54 points) in the Eastern Conference, they could find themselves down in fifth should all of the results go against them.\nThat would make next Sunday’s regular-season finale in Montreal all the more juicy considering the plot twists that await.\nBefore that, though, Vanney will once again need to turn to his bench this weekend.\nStarting centre-back Damien Perquis — a monster in recent weeks — remains sidelined with what appears to be a semi-serious hamstring injury.\nHis replacement, likely Ahmed Kantari, will be in tough on Saturday having not featured prominently all season.\nThe embattled, big-money defensive signing has conceded bad penalties and been suspended once this season. As a result, all eyes will be on the Moroccan defender to see if he can be a replacement rock at the back Toronto’s brass thought he’d be.\nA little less worrisome — more annoying then anything — is Jozy Altidore’s status heading into the weekend.\nAltidore’s expected to receive at least a one-game suspension after he was red carded for “verbally abusing” an official while seated on TFC’s bench during Wednesday’s victory.\nAltidore told the Toronto Sun post-game he didn’t say anything and didn’t expect a suspension. It’s very likely that was wishful thinking.\nIt’s very likely Heruculez Gomez will earn a second-straight start in his place.\nGomez, who scored the opener midweek, has been biding his time since arriving mid-summer. The blunt-spoken, former U.S. international knew he’d get a chance to make a difference eventually.\nConsidering Altidore’s looming suspension, Gomez wouldn’t say whether he expected to play Saturday.\n“I don’t know, that is up to Greg and the coaching staff,” Gomez said. “What I do know is that I’ll be ready if called upon. I want to keep building upon my play.”\nAnd the Reds are hoping to continue building momentum they hoped this stretch of home games would present.\nThe goal now is to lock up home-field advantage with a fifth consecutive result on Saturday.\nAfter that, it’s on to Montreal, where Toronto FC would love to spoil their rivals’ season.\nOn top of team results, the cherry would be Giovinco winning everything.\nThe Golden Boot could also be decided Saturday.\nKICKOFF\n- The indication is that Michael Bradley has recovered from a slight groin injury and will play on Saturday.\n- Giovinco is in the hunt to become the first MLSer since 2007 to win league MVP, Golden Boot and Newcomer of the year.\n- Giovinco is currently tied for the league lead in goals (22) and assists (15) with Philly’s Cristian Maidana.\nMARQUEE\nThe two most lethal MLS strikers finally face off for Golden Boot supremacy. While these two likely won’t clash at any point on the pitch come Saturday, with both clubs having already qualified for the playoffs, eyes around the league will want to see who takes the lead. Both of these players are having career years after arriving from Europe before the start of the season. Don’t rule out both finding goals in a match that’s also filled with playoff implications. The only thing standing in the way of Giovinco’s near-perfect regular season could be Kamara after next weekend.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nBoot-strappin' game for TFC\nBy Kurtis Larson , Toronto Sun First posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 11:16 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 16, 2015 11:22 PM EDT\nIt’d be easy for Toronto FC’s Sebastian Giovinco to coast into the post-season.\nHe’s already, without question, Major League Soccer’s MVP.\nHe’ll undoubtedly win Newcomer of the Year.\nAnyone with a half a brain knows Giovinco’s game-winner Wednesday night should win Goal of the Year.\nWith a playoff spot locked up, it’d be easy — maybe the expectation — for a Designated Player to curl up in his Yorkville high-rise and sip on espresso all day.\nQuite frankly, nobody would blame him.\nAfter all, Giovinco — fresh off a long-haul trip with the Italian national team — deserves a nice, long break heading into the post-season, especially after his performance midweek.\nBut with the Columbus Crew in town Saturday afternoon, Giovinco undoubtedly sees this as another opportunity to claim another award.
