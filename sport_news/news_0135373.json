A few years ago, Syracuse had some of the same problems. How can it be that the coaches of these three college teams did not know what their players were doing when the players left the court? \nAll three of these coaches have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Jim Phelan, former coach of the Mount St. Mary’s basketball team, was aware of everything going on, on and off the court, and is worthy of being inducted into the Hall of Fame. He was a great coach and one of the finest people you ever met. \nPhelan had 830 wins in his 49 years at Mount St. Mary’s University. Isn’t that enough? \nRoy Sigler", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:19:33.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
