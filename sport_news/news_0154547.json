It's unclear if the company that owns the vehicle - Ride the Ducks of Seattle - was aware of the warning, Weener said.\n\"We're going to be following that,\" he said.\nRide The Ducks of Seattle owner Brian Tracey said Sunday night the company was cooperating fully with authorities. And in a statement Tracey said he was in \"complete agreement\" with calls by Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray that the duck boats remain sidelined pending a state inspection of all the vehicles.\nTracey said the company was \"absolutely heartbroken\" about the accident.\nFour international college students died at the scene of the crash, and a fifth - identified as a 20-year-old woman - died Sunday, Harborview Medical Center said. They were among about 45 students and staff from North Seattle College who were on the bus on the six lane bridge with no median when the tourist-carrying duck boat swerved into it.\nMore than 50 people were taken to hospitals. At least 13 people remained at Seattle hospitals Sunday.\nThe amphibious vehicle tours are offered around the world, including in Philadelphia; Austin, Texas; Miami; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and London. They feature former military landing craft repurposed as tour vehicles.\nThe vehicle involved in the Seattle crash was an Army surplus craft built in 1945. It was refurbished with a General Motors engine and chassis in 2005, Weener said.\nThe NTSB had few details Sunday about the warning Ride the Ducks International issued. It wasn't clear what prompted the warning or how the potential failure was discovered, or whether it applied to all duck boats or only those that the company had refurbished, he said. It wasn't clear how many of the 100 duck boats in service nationally may have had the repair, he said.\nThe warning included specific instructions for inspecting the area where the shaft could fail, as well as instructions for the repair, which involved welding collars around the axle shaft, Weener said.\nResults of the federal probe are not expected for a year, he said. Investigators have interviewed 11 surviving passengers, including eight who were on the duck, as well as first responders. They expect to interview the drivers of the charter bus and the duck this week.\nWeener described Ride the Ducks of Seattle as cooperative, and said the company had turned over training records and maintenance documents for the duck.\nIt's the first time the NTSB has looked into a land crash of the amphibious vehicles, which critics say are too dangerous for city streets. The federal agency has scrutinized duck tour vehicles several times when they've been in accidents on water.\nState regulators also have opened an investigation, which entails inspecting all vehicle and driver records. The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission will meet Monday to discuss its authority to shut down the company until that review is complete, Inslee said.\nThe amphibious vehicle involved in the crash - known as Duck No. 6 - underwent regular annual examinations by a federally certified inspector, most recently in 2015 and 2014, and met federal standards, said commission spokeswoman Amanda Maxwell.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:05:43.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
