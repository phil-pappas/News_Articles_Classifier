Solder immediately winced in pain, held his arm and walked toward the sideline. Afterward, Solder left the stadium with tape wrapped to the inside of his right arm, which hinted it wasn't the elbow.\nSolder allowed two sacks and two quarterback hits Sunday against the Cowboys, and he surrendered a team-high three sacks through four games. However, he has historically improved over the course of each season, and the loss will also be felt in the ground game, as the Patriots routinely like to run to the left side.\nSebastian Vollmer (2.5 sacks allowed) and Marcus Cannon (two sacks allowed, both at left tackle) are the only other tackles on the active roster, so the Patriots should be expected to promote 2014 fourth-round draft pick Cameron Fleming from the practice squad.\nVollmer played well during five snaps on Tom Brady's blind side in 2009, but he hasn't been over there since, so that option might not even be on their radar as they look to replace Solder.\nCannon has started 12 games in his career, including the playoffs, at right tackle and both guard positions, but he has never started at left tackle despite rotating through the position a handful of times. Cannon will have to deal with Colts edge rushers Robert Mathis and Trent Cole on Sunday night.The Patriots have rotated their offensive linemen at an unprecedented rate this season, and part of the reason was for a situation like this in the event they'd lose someone to an injury. Now, Cannon will see an increased amount of reps, rather than being thrust into action after being cold all season.\nSolder signed a two-year, $20.062 million contract extension that included a $12.5 million signing bonus Sept. 9. He remains under contract through the 2017 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:26:49.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
