(Photo: Coach AC Patterson) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPORTLAND, Ore. -- The Portland State Vikings have been one of the most surprising teams in college football this season. \nNew head coach Bruce Barnum, who began the season as the interim head coach, has led the No. 14 Vikings to a 5-1 start, and was rewarded with a five-year contract last week . \nAmong the many changes Barnum has implemented is travel. When possible, the team travels by bus instead of plane. \nAnd so far it's worked. The team bused to Pullman, where they beat Washington State 24-17 in the season opener. It was Portland State's first ever win against a Pac-12 opponent. \nThe Vikings bused to Pocatello, Idaho, for its matchup against Idaho State. They won 34-14. \nThis week, they're busing to southern California as the team takes on Cal Poly Saturday night. \nBut the trips aren't just about football. \nAmong the stops on this week's road trip was In-N-Out on Thursday and Alcatraz on Friday. \nAfter the pit stops though, it's all business as the Vikings look to improve to 6-1, making the two-day trek back to Portland much more enjoyable.
