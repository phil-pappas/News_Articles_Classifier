Carmi scoring plays: Luke Simon run, Ty Stubblefield conversion Luke Simon run, Bryce Conner conversion Luke Simon run Coach Spud Egbert’s comments about Saturday championship game. “All the parents and coaches are very proud of the hard work these young men have put in to achieve this level of success. I have coached the 5th/6th grade since the inception in 1994 and this team’s effort to win Carmi’s FIRST 5th/6th grade Jr. Pro Football Championship for the program speaks for itself. This group of young men, if they all stay out for football, encourage their classmates to join them, and continue their hard work and efforts, have a real good chance to go further in High School Playoffs than any prior team in Carmi White County High School history. I should point out that the 7th/8th grade Jr. Pro Football Program was started in 1993 and has won championships at that level in the past.” 7th/8th grade: CWC 30, Johnson County 12 (3rd place) Carmi scoring: Hunter Colman - 3-yard run, (Jaedon Reeder conversion) Jaedon Reeder - 83 yard run Ehtan Mahon - 24-yard run (Jaedon Reeder conversion) Hunter Colman - 4 -yard run (Jaedon Reeder conversion) The Carmi Times - Carmi, IL Writer Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 1:00 PM Updated at 1:06 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:35:39.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
