One agent recognized 58-year-old Timmie L. Smith as a suspect identified in surveillance photos in a robbery last Wednesday at a Wells Fargo at 1900 S.W. 5th Ave. and a second Wells Fargo heist Monday at 900 S.W. 5th Ave. , according to the FBI.\nSmith is accused of fleeing with a combined $2,820 from the downtown Portland banks after passing notes to tellers demanding money, a criminal complaint filed in federal court said. While he was being arrested, Smith reportedly asked the agents, \"What took you so long?\"\n\"I want to go back to prison. I don't want to be let out,\" Smith said, according to the complaint.\nSmith appeared before a judge in federal court Wednesday and was ordered to be held in jail on suspicion of bank robbery. He is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 2.\n-- Everton Bailey Jr.\nebailey@oregonian.com\n503-221-8343; @EvertonBailey", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/evertonbailey"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:19:26.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
