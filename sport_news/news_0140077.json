There was not a single game decided by less than 17 points. \nLet’s recap Week 7: \nBuckeye Central Bucks 48, Bucyrus Redmen 19 \nOne would not be surprised by this outcome as the Bucks offense dominated the headlines. \nBucks quarterback Grant Loy teamed up with Brice Brenneman to torch the Redmen for three scores; Loy would add another before the night was over. \nBut the surprising part is how the Bucks responded to the season ending injury to all-star running back Cody Roberts. Athen Moyer stepped in as his replacement and touched the football 19 times for 188 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Bucks racked up 392 yards on just 37 plays. \nThe Redmen might have found their quarterback for the future. Sophomore Damon Parsell stepped in under center and threw for 100 yards on 14-23 with a touchdown. He also ran the football 22 times and racked up 115 yards accounting for 215 yards of total offense. \nPlayer of the Game: Bucks quarterback Grant Loy connected on 12 of 16 passes for 203 yards and four touchdowns. \nStat of the night: The 19 points for the Bucyrus Redmen is the highest total since the Redmen put up 25 in a Week 2 win at Crestline. \nWynford Royals 55, Seneca East Tigers 6 \nThe Royals are making football life unfair for the entire Northern 10 Conference. \nSeneca East strolled in tied for second place in the N10 with a 4-1 record and left without giving much of a fight. The Tigers managed to get on the board early in the first quarter, but the Royal defense never let them get a sniff of the goal line again. \nOffensively, the Royals' ground game shined yet again. The Royals scored seven times on the ground and once through the air. They racked up an unbelievable 550 yards rushing. \nPlayers of the Game: Zach Hoffman and Nick Looker were as identical on the field as they were in the stat sheet. Each player ran for 171 yards and two scores. Hoffman added a score through the air. \nStat of the night: Royals halfback Cole Fortner ran the ball just four times for 110 yards and two touchdowns. \nColonel Crawford Eagles 42, Manchester Panthers 20 \nThe Eagles may have solidified their spot in the playoffs with an important win over Manchester. \nThey used a fast 28-0 start to cruise to a win at home. Will Kirkpatrick and Blake Treisch were, yet again, the highlight of the Eagles offense. \nThe Eagles used the run game to build a comfortable lead. Treisch carried the ball 12 times and rushed for 147 yards and three touchdowns. \nKirkpatrick’s number was not called on much to throw the football, but when he did, he was efficient. The quarterback completed four of five passes for 87 yards and a touchdown strike to Noah Ferguson. \nPlayer of the Game: Kirkpatrick ran for 181 yards on 27 carries to go along with his passing performance. He accounted for four touchdowns. \nStat of the night: Treisch had three touchdowns on the ground: two from 41 yards out and a 29-yarder to cap the big plays. \nGalion Tigers 38, River Valley Vikings 21 \nThe Tigers found themselves in an early 21-7 hole, which would bury most teams. \nBut a surprising second half proved the Tigers were not ready to give up on a potential playoff berth and the defense pitched a second half shut out to help the Tigers improve to 5-2. \nChase Cooke turned into the quarterback the tigers have been hoping for all season long. The junior connected on just five of eight throws but racked up 197 yards including a touchdown strike to Jacob Fryer. \nThe third quarter was the turning point as the Tigers scored on three straight possessions to take the lead. \nPlayer of the Game: Galion running back Drake Barnett accounted for 121 yards on a work horse like 27 carries and three touchdowns. \nStat of the night: The Tigers scored three times in the third quarter, all of which came from Barnett. He has runs of 13, 3 and 5 for scores. \nLucas Cubs 61, Crestline Bulldogs 7 \nUnfortunately for the Bulldogs, the MBC is loaded with heavyweights, and they have finally found themselves clear of the knockout fighters. \nWith three games left, the Bulldogs do not have another MBC opponent and will look to finally break the losing streak. \nPlayer of the Game: For the Bulldogs, J.R. Wolfe has been the guy at quarterback and pretty much the entire offense. He connected on 6 of 19 passes for 112 yards and a touchdown. \nStat of the night: Crestline wide receiver Tyler Sipes caught just two Wolfe passes but racked up 79 yards receiving, including a 75-yard first quarter touchdown strike.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:44:28.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
