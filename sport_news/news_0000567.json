Though there are differences between the two cases — Dominick's was found liable by the court ahead of trial for its unauthorized ad comparing Jordan to a cut-price steak while Jewel's liability for what appears to be a less egregious unauthorized use would be determined by a jury — the Dominick's case may have set the bar for a resolution, legal experts said in August.\nDominick's wants $8.9 million verdict in Michael Jordan case reduced Robert Channick The defunct Dominick's supermarket chain wants to dramatically reduce the $8.9 million awarded to Michael Jordan by a federal jury last month for using his likeness without permission in a 2009 ad.\nDominick's and its parent company, Safeway, want the judgment for damages awarded to Jordan reduced...\nThe defunct Dominick's supermarket chain wants to dramatically reduce the $8.9 million awarded to Michael Jordan by a federal jury last month for using his likeness without permission in a 2009 ad.\nDominick's and its parent company, Safeway, want the judgment for damages awarded to Jordan reduced...\n(Robert Channick) The $8.9 million judgment was seen as a triumph for Jordan. It dwarfed the $126,900 that an expert hired by Dominick's, who is also expected to be the main defense witness for Jewel, said it should pay.\nFeinerman on Wednesday warned lawyers for Jewel that there was \"little chance\" that a jury would not find it liable for its ad, which used Jewel's tagline to suggest that for Chicagoans, Jordan was, like Jewel-Osco supermarkets, \"just around the corner.\"\nFurther complicating the case are Dominick's ongoing attempts to overturn the $8.9 million verdict and the fact that Jewel-Osco and Dominick's now share the same ultimate owner, Cerberus Capital.\nJordan's attorney, Fred Sperling, noted the joint ownership interest when explaining the settlement talks to Feinerman, telling the judge the talks have \"the attention of the highest level of the defendants.\"\nAsked outside court if that meant that a grand resolution to both cases could be reached under which Dominick's abandons its appeal in return for a more modest settlement of the Jewel case, Sperling declined to comment.\nJordan says 'it was never about the money' after $8.9M jury award Kim Janssen A delighted Michael Jordan said \"it was never about the money\" Friday night after a federal jury ordered the owners of the defunct supermarket chain Dominick's to pay him $8.9 million for using his identity without permission in an advertisement.\nBeaming outside the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse moments...\nA delighted Michael Jordan said \"it was never about the money\" Friday night after a federal jury ordered the owners of the defunct supermarket chain Dominick's to pay him $8.9 million for using his identity without permission in an advertisement.\nBeaming outside the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse moments...\n(Kim Janssen) A failure to reach a deal would send Jordan, who said in August that the cases were \"never about the money,\" back to the stand to testify in December. His advisers say he is ready and willing to do so to protect his valuable identity, which makes him the world's best-paid athlete more than a decade after his retirement from the court.\nAfter the Dominick's verdict, Jordan said he planned to give the money to Chicago charities.\nkjanssen@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kimjnews\n Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c2ffa/turbine/ct-michael-jordan-jewel-1001-biz-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55d7e273/turbine/ct-michael-jordan-dominicks-case-0822-biz-20150821", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5601e861/turbine/ct-michael-jordan-dominicks-case-0923-biz-20150922"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:10:07.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
