While Vela rounded off the scoring with a neat chip from a narrow angle. \nAnd Levante’s miserable day was summed up a minute from time when Brazilian forward Deyverson was shown a second yellow card for diving inside the area. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:08:17.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
