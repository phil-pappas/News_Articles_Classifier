Posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 11:44 pm FOOTBALL: Bulldogs win shootout 51-47 over Highlanders BY KEVIN HARRIS News and Tribune Posted on Oct 16, 2015 \nNEW ALBANY — Ninth-year Floyd Central head coach Brian Glesing summed up Friday night’s annual Floyd County rivalry meeting with New Albany at Buerk Field the best to start his postgame press conference. \n“Typical Floyd Central-New Albany game,” the veteran Highlander boss said. \nGlesing's statement was right on the mark. \nSophomore wide receiver Rondale Moore scored on a 10-yard touchdown run with eight seconds left in regulation to help the Bulldogs regain the anchor trophy with a thrilling 51-47 victory over the archival Highlanders. \nThe New Albany victory tied the all-time series at 23. For the eighth time in the last 10 meetings, the annual rivalry has had a single-digit final margin. Five of the eight single-figure margins have been one point. \nFirst-year Bulldogs’ head coach Sean Coultis did not expect Friday’s contest to be the wide-open affair it became. \n“I thought it was going to be a low-scoring game,” Coultis said. “I thought both teams were going to slow it down and run the ball because that’s what both of us do. But it turned into a shutout and who has the ball last.” \nThis barnburner fittingly started with a touchdown on the first play from scrimmage. \nMoore got the handoff on the jet sweep and had a 58-yard touchdown run 19 seconds into the game to put New Albany (4-5, 3-4 Hoosier Hills Conference) up 7-0. \nThe Highlanders (4-5, 3-4) answered with two touchdowns in a row. \nFloyd running back Colt May capped off a nine-play, 56-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown scamper to tie the game at seven. \nThe Highlanders did not take advantage of a fumble by New Albany running back Darquan Richardson as place-kicker Antonio Villegas had a 25-yard field-goal attempt blocked, which put the ball at the New Albany 2-yard line. \nBut after making a 2-yard run, Richardson fumbled the ball again. Senior Keaton Stiller recovered the ball in the end zone at the 2:44 mark of the opening quarter to give Floyd its first lead of the night at 13-7. The Highlanders increased their lead to eight when they faked the extra-point attempt, and senior Brady Miles connected with junior Tyler Young in the end zone on a successful two-point conversion. \nThe TD and two-point play began a sequence for the rest of the game when the teams traded scores back and forth. \nThe Bulldogs tied the game at 15 with 1:17 left in the period. On second-and-8, freshman quarterback Dylan Clark found junior wide receiver Davin Alexander on a 31-yard touchdown pass. Then Clark, who was making his varsity debut, hit senior Derek Griffin on a toss to convert the two-point conversion. \nEarly in the second quarter, running back Brandon Striegel had a 2-yard TD run to put the Highlanders back up 21-15. The extra-point kick got blocked. \nThe Bulldogs responded with a six-play, 66-yard series that ended with Moore’s second touchdown of the night on a 9-yard run to give New Albany its first lead at 22-21. \nFloyd got the advantage back at 29-21 with 3:37 left in the first half. Highlander junior Bradley Philpot snagged a 28-yard TD pass from quarterback Matthew Weimer. That was followed by May getting into the end zone on a two-point conversion run. \nThe Bulldogs got the lead back by using some trickery. \nOn third-and-13 at the New Albany 34, Moore received a handoff on what appeared to be a sweep. But Moore threw the ball to Alexander for a 66-yard TD reception to put the Bulldogs down one at 29-28. \nNew Albany set up for the extra point with Moore as the holder. But Moore had trouble handling the snap and responded quickly by taking the pigskin into the end zone for a pair of points to give the Bulldogs a 30-29 lead. \nHowever, the Highlanders had the last laugh in the opening half. Senior running back Blake Carl made a 26-yard TD run on fourth-and-4 as time expired. Floyd came up short on a two-point conversion as it led 35-30 at intermission. \nNew Albany scored on its first possession of the second half. After Bulldog senior Michael Maxwell made a 37-yard reception while being heavily covered to get the ball into the red zone, Moore made a 17-yard TD gallop on a sweep to give New Albany a 37-35 lead. \nBut Carl came through again for Floyd with a 14-yard TD scamper with 5:22 left in the third as the Highlanders went back up 41-37. \nIn the fourth quarter, Richardson gave New Albany a 44-41 advantage with a 5-yard TD run with 7:30 left in regulation. But on fourth-and-one-half yard, Weimer found Philpot for a 50-yard TD reception with 3:48 remaining to pull the Highlanders back in front at 47-44. But Villegas failed to put Floyd up four points as he missed the extra-point attempt wide left. \nStarting from their own 39, the Bulldogs drove 61 yards on nine plays for the game-winning TD. On third-and-8, Moore recorded his fourth touchdown with a 10-yard run on another sweep to seal the win and send the Highlanders to their fourth straight loss. Both teams recorded season-highs in scoring on Friday night. \n“You hope your defense can make a play, and we weren’t able to make a play. That’s the bottom line,” Glesing said. “Forty-seven points should be good enough to win. Defensively, we just didn’t do it.” \nCoultis was happy with how his defense played in the game’s closing moments. \n“Our defense did in the second half step up and make some plays when we needed to,” Coultis said. “I was very proud of our defense that they didn’t hang their heads.” \nThe Highlanders will get next Friday off before starting sectional play. They will host Bedford North Lawrence in the Class 5A Sectional 16 semifinal Friday, Oct. 30. New Albany will stay at home next Friday for the Class 6A Sectional 8 semifinals, as it hosts archival Jeffersonville. \nNEW ALBANY 51, FLOYD CENTRAL 47 \nFloyd Central 15 20 6 6—47 \nNew Albany 15 15 7 14—51 \nSCORING SUMMARY \nNA — Rondale Moore 58 run (Mergen Batchulun kick), 11:41. \nFC — Colt May 4 run (Antonio Villegas kick), 7:28. \nFC — Keaton Stiller recover fumble in end zone (Tyler Young pass from Brady Miles), 2:44. \nNA — Davin Alexander 31 pass from Dylan Clark (Derek Griffin pass from Clark), 1:17. \nSecond quarter \nFC — Brandon Striegel 2 run (kick blocked), 11:01. \nNA — Moore 9 run (Batchulun kick), 7:08. \nFC — Bradley Philpot 28 pass from Matthew Weimer (May run), 3:37. \nNA — Alexander 66 pass from Moore (Moore run), 1:33. \nFC — Blake Carl 26 run (pass failed), :00. \nThird quarter \nNA — Moore 17 run (Batchulun kick), 8:53. \nFC — Carl 14 run (run failed), 5:22. \nFourth quarter \nNA — Darquan Richardson 5 run (Batchulun kick), 7:30. \nFC — Philpot 50 pass from Weimer (kick failed), 3:48. \nNA — Moore 10 run (Batchulun kick), :08. \nkevin.harris@newsandtribune.com With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:09:06.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
