Starting Nov. 13, landlords must give tenants at least 90 days' notice for no-cause evictions or when they plan to raise rent 5 percent or more. The rules apply to tenants on month-to-month leases.\nThe rules don't apply to week-to-week renters or those renting a room in a landlord's home; those tenants get 30 days' notice if they've been in the home less than a year, 60 days' if longer.\nLandlord organizations and renter advocates were still processing the changes Thursday.\n\"It's definitely going to be challenging to get this information out to everyone that needs to know about it,\" said Deborah Imse, executive director of Multifamily Northwest, which represents landlords.\nImse said her organization, which includes 400 members who manage 10 or fewer units , would send an alert Thursday afternoon. Portland has 100,000 to 125,000 rental units, including homes and apartments, Imse said.\nJustin Buri, executive director of the nonprofit Community Alliance of Tenants, said volunteers will monitor the agency's already-busy hotline to see what renters say.\n\"We certainly hope that landlords would not be pre-emptively issuing evictions or rent increases to avoid a longer notification period,\" Buri said, adding that he doesn't expect many to do that.\n-- Andrew Theen\natheen@oregonian.com\n503-294-4026\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:02:35.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
