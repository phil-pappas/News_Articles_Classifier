(AP) â€” Luke Falk tied the school record with six touchdown passes, all in the first half, as Washington State beat Oregon State 52-31 on Saturday. \nWashington State (4-2, 2-1 Pac-12), coming off an upset victory at Oregon, hadn't beaten a Pac-12 opponent in Martin Stadium since November 2013. \nThey have already eclipsed the three wins they had all of last season, and this was the 100th win of coach Mike Leach's career. \nThe Cougars scored on all seven of their first-half possessions and piled up 523 yards of offense. \nQuarterback Seth Collins threw for 176 yards and ran for 124 yards for Oregon State (2-4, 0-3), which gave up more than 40 points for the third consecutive week. The Beavers rushed for 215 yards in the game. \nFalk, who threw for 505 yards and five touchdowns at Oregon, completed 39 of 50 passes for 407 yards, with two interceptions. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
