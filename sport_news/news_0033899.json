Damian Lillard added 22 points for Portland before calling it a night at the end of the third quarter. Stephen Curry put up 30 points in 26 minutes for the Warriors in the loss, also sitting for the final quarter. CJ McCollum, who had only five points in Monday night's preseason opener against the Kings, stepped up with 19 points on the Warriors. The Blazers led by as many as 25 points in the game and the Blazer's bench outscored the Warriors' 49-27. WARRIORS: Golden State started its regular season starters: Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut and Harrison Barnes. They combined for 71 points. Thompson and Green each finished with 14. TRAIL BLAZERS: Forward Al-Farouq Aminu and his wife Helina, welcomed their first child, Emanah, who was born Monday night. Aminu started against the Warriors, finishing with 11 points in his debut as a Blazer. CJ AT POINT: Blazers Coach Terry Stotts said it was important to get a look at CJ McCollum at point guard, spelling starter Damian Lillard. McCollum did not play at the point last season because Steve Blake served as Lillard's backup. UP NEXT: The Trail Blazers visit the Kings on Saturday night, while the Warriors host the Denver Nuggets next Tuesday.
