The headline was a question: \"Is this the end of Alabama's dynasty?\" \nNot yet. That was clear this past Saturday. \nThis season could well produce a fourth national championship in the last seven years under coach Nick Saban. \nAlabama is back up to No. 8 in the AP poll after the win over Georgia. \nEven if it doesn't, think about going forward. \nRidley caught a 45-yard touchdown against Georgia, part of a breakthrough five-catch, 120-yard performance for the freshman from Florida who offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin said during the summer has the potential to be an All-American- and Biletnikoff Award-level player. \nFitzpatrick was referred to as \"the next great one\" among Tide defensive backs by well-known ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit during Alabama's season-opening win over Wisconsin. \nThere were several other young players that made big impacts during the win over Georgia. \nRELATED: 2 Alabama freshmen have breakout games vs. Georgia \nFive-star freshman defensive tackle Daron Payne helped Alabama limit Georgia star running back Nick Chubb to 63 yards on 19 carries aside from a late long touchdown run after the Tide were already up 38-3. \nRedshirt freshman cornerback Marlon Humphrey — the starter opposite senior Cyrus Jones — had an interception. Harrison's interception was his second in as many games while contributing as the Tide's dime back and a reserve safety. \nSophomore inside linebacker Shaun Dion Hamilton had five tackles. \nA young left side of the offensive line, meanwhile, helped clear the way for Tide running back Derrick Henry to rush for 148 yards and a touchdown while averaging 5.7 yards per carry against a Bulldogs defense that limited its first four opponents to a combined average of 3.1 yards per rush attempt. \nAided by those two young linemen — sophomore left tackle Cam Robinson and redshirt freshman left guard Ross Pierschbacher — Alabama also held Georgia — which has two of the top pass rushers in the SEC — without a sack or quarterback hurry. Ross Pierschbacher Ross Pierschbacher discusses Georgia win, improvements on the OL and more. \nRobinson established himself as an All-SEC-caliber player last season while neutralizing talented opponents such as former Florida standout defensive end Dante Fowler, the No. 3 overall pick in this year's NFL draft. \nPierschbacher received high praise from Saban Wednesday , referred to by his coach as - along with senior center Ryan Kelly - one of Alabama's two most consistent offensive linemen through five games this season. \nPierschbacher has allowed just a half-sack and has just two missed assignments in five games while having recorded 13 knockdown blocks. \nThis is a team with numerous talented young players already making an impact. \nThe Tide will replace their starting quarterback for a third straight year as Jake Coker is a senior. They will also likely lose their top two running backs — junior Derrick Henry and senior Kenyan Drake — as Henry is widely projected to be an early-round pick in next year's NFL draft should he declare. \nHowever, Alabama has five-star freshman quarterback Blake Barnett, ranked by ESPN as the top pocket passer in this year's recruiting class. \nAt running back, the Tide have two other former five-star players — freshmen Damien Harris and Bo Scarbrough, a versatile 6-foot-2, 240-pounder who ran the 40-yard dash in 4.53 seconds during the spring. \nThe Tide's two starting receivers — Ridley and redshirt sophomore ArDarius Stewart — figure to continue to get better and more consistent as they gain experience. Redshirt sophomore Robert Foster — a starter before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury — will be back as well. \nFoster had 10 catches for 116 yards and two touchdowns in two-plus games prior to getting hurt against Ole Miss Sept. 19. \nThat offensive line, meanwhile, should be in good shape with Robinson and Pierschbacher anchoring the left side. \nDefensively, Fitzpatrick, Humphrey and Harrison have the look of a nice core group to build around in the secondary while others like Payne, ex-prized recruit Da'Shawn Hand and Hamilton are among the freshmen and sophomore front seven players who have already begun to contribute. \nThat doesn't even include the Tide's future classes, which are already full of highly-rated commits, or promising former top prospects such as sophomore outside linebacker Rashaan Evans who have been stuck behind veteran players on Alabama's depth chart. \n\"Certainly proud of sort of the statement that [the team] made in the game [against Georgia],\" Saban said. \"They beat a good team. Obviously there are a lot of things that we can do better and clean up, and that's certainly something we need to be committed to.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:31:55.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
