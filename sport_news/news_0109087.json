He brought a lot of that talkative leadership out of guys.” \nTunsil rejoins the Rebels after serving a seven-game suspension for accepting impermissible benefits that included using three loaner vehicles over a six-month period without paying, the use of a rental car and receiving an airline ticket. \nHis return comes at a fortunate time for the No. 24 Rebels (5-2, 2-1 SEC), who host No. 15 Texas A&M (5-1, 2-1 SEC) at 6 p.m. Saturday. \nThe Aggies have 20 sacks, tied for 14th in the FBS. They are led by sophomore Myles Garrett, whose 8.5 sacks rank third nationally, and junior Daeshon Hall, tied for 25th with five sacks, and true freshman Daylon Mack, who has six tackles for loss. \n“It’s an SEC defensive line that has a lot of guys that probably get more attention than some others, just like every team does,” Rebels coach Hugh Freeze said. “They’re all very talented.” \nTunsil figures to be lined up against Garrett throughout the game, perhaps for the majority of it. Both will likely be Top 10 picks when they enter the NFL Draft. \n“(Garrett) already is one of the greatest players in college football and will go down as one of the best players to ever play at Texas A&M and in the SEC,” Aggies offensive lineman Germain Ifedi said at Southeastern Conference football media days in July. “Very few guys in the country are going to be able to block him.” \nThe Rebels have been inconsistent against elite pass-rushing teams without Tunsil, who hasn’t been made available for comment since returning from his suspension. \nThey gave up only two sacks against Alabama, both on consecutive plays to end the third quarter while leading by 13 points. Their strong performance allowed quarterback Chad Kelly to throw for 341 yards and three touchdowns in the 43-37 road upset. \nBut then they surrendered four sacks against Florida two weeks later, including three in a first half in which the Gators raced out to a 25-point lead. Kelly finished with 259 passing yards and one touchdown while being hit hard throughout the 38-10 blowout loss. \nBoth defenses are comparable to the Aggies’ at reaching opposing quarterbacks. Alabama’s 22 sacks are tied for eighth; Florida’s 21 are tied for 11th. \nThe Rebels will be relying on a remade offensive line on Saturday. \nEither Bell or Ben Still will start at center after Robert Conyers tore his left ACL last Saturday against Memphis. Aaron Morris could also start at left guard over the injured Javon Patterson, while Tunsil’s return shifts Fahn Cooper to right tackle, his natural position. \nTunsil and Cooper figure to line up the most against Garrett and Hall, but Bell hopes to see some time against those two elite pass rushers as well. \n“You always want to compete against the best,” Bell said. “Hopefully, I’ll be pulling and get a little contact on them.” \nShepard upset \nFormer cornerback Tee Shepard seems upset with the circumstances surrounding his departure after leaving the team on Oct. 7. \n“I want the truth to come out, people either going to believe me or (Rebels head coach Hugh) Freeze,” Shepard said in a screenshot of a direct message posted on Twitter. \nHe added in the conversation his experiences made him “feel unwelcome to the team and useless” and that he didn’t think the Rebels truly wanted him. \n“Ole Miss recruited me at the last min(ute) during signing when they found out I was going to State,” added Shepard, who committed to Mississippi State before flipping to the Rebels. \nA text message to a phone number listed as his elicited the following response: “This is his mother. We’re not interested in an interview. It seems like the public is misconstruing statements and concerns. Thank you. Please do not contact this number again. Thanks.” \nA follow-up text message that said an interview would be an opportunity for Shepard to provide his side of the story received the following response: “Apparently, you do not honor requests very well. Once again, NO THANK YOU!” \nFreeze said Monday morning that he would have a meeting later that day with Shepard, who collected two tackles and one pass breakup in five games this season. A member of the Rebels’ 2014 signing class, Shepard missed last season after tearing a tendon in a toe. \n“I love Tee Shepard,” Freeze said. “He actually called me (Sunday), and we had a good conversation. I know exactly what was told to him, and I know how much I tried to get him to stay and work through any issues. He is a good kid. I’ll leave it at that.” \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com.
