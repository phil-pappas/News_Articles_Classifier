Back Photo: 2 of 2 Next AP Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry reacts to a call during a preseason game against the Pacers on Saturday in Indianapolis. \nAlvin Gentry promised to bring an up-tempo offense to New Orleans when he was hired last May as head coach. \nFriday night’s game at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena will be the second of the preseason for the Pelicans, and it should be another significant step for a young team that’s trying to inject more energy in its personality. \n“It’s a tough process,” Gentry said. “They seem to be getting better at it. Our whole goal is to be ready to play on the [Oct.] 27th, our opening game. \n“We’ve got to understand as a coaching staff we have to take baby steps. There has to be progress every day. It may not be to the point where we want it, but as long as we get better we’ll eventually get there.” \nTipoff against the Atlanta Hawks is 7 p.m., Friday. \nThe game marks the third year in a row the Pelicans have played an exhibition in Jacksonville. The Hawks last played here in 2009 against Miami. \nNew Orleans, which finished 45-37 last season and was then swept in the playoffs by eventual champion Golden State, shot 32 times from 3-point range in its first preseason game last Saturday at Indiana, and it had 22 points in transition. The Pelicans won 110-105. \n“We know how we want to play — up and down,” New Orleans forward Anthony Davis said. “Even though we were sloppy, we scored 110 points. Just imagine when we get it right.” \nAfter losing in the playoffs last season, Gentry replaced Monty Williams. Last year’s team averaged 19.3 shots from behind the arc. \nGentry came from NBC champion Golden State where he was the associate head coach. He brought the Warriors' fast-paced offensive scheme with him. \n“It’s a good system,” forward Luke Babbitt said. “It’s a good system for shooters like me. The floor needs to be spaced for guys like A.D. [Davis], Tyreke [Evans] and Jrue [Holiday]. Penetrators, they need spacing. So the more guys we have out there to shoot, the better. \n“I think the results were good considering everything.” \nWith center Alexis Ajinca sidelined with a hamstring injury, Friday’s game also will give Gentry the opportunity to find new lineups. Davis could move to the post and it could lead to more playing time for Kendrick Perkins. \nBut the priority is to continue with the new offense until it becomes habit. \n“It’s hard for them to play on instinct right now,” Gentry said. “They’re trying to learn exactly what they should be doing, where they should be.” \nOne of Gentry’s goals is for New Orleans to take at least 110 shots. They took 103 against the Pacers, so the faster pace still isn’t at full speed. \nBabbitt took nine of them, including seven from 3-point range. \n“We’ve got a lot to build on, which is good,” he said. “We don’t want to be perfect right now. We want to grow every day.’’ \n“There’s a new energy, a new culture going on. It’s a long process. The energy’s good right now.” \nAnd it’s only going to get faster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:49:14.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
