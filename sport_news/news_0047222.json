( Andy Cross, The Denver Post ) \nAvalanche coach Patrick Roy tried to stay positive Friday. A day after his team blew a three-goal, third-period lead in a 5-4 loss to the visiting Minnesota Wild on opening night, Roy declined to show his players video of the 5-minute, 7-second horror show that featured four Minnesota goals. \n\"I'd rather show them the first 45 (minutes),\" Roy said after practice at the Pepsi Center. \"We talked about the first 45 because this is what we want to do. I wanted them to see the good things we did.\" \nColorado led 4-1 after two periods. \n\"We had great intensity. We were quick on loose pucks. We finished our checks. We brought pucks at the end,\" Roy said. \"Defensively, we were blocking shots. We were patient in our own end. We had sticks in the right place. And we had a great neutral-zone forecheck. \n\"These are things that will make us win hockey games. If I show the negatives, that's not what we want.\" \nThe Avs practiced Friday in front of season-ticket holders who got the first glimpse of the team's new third-jersey attire. The new uniforms, which include navy helmets, pants and socks, will debut Oct. 24 against the visiting Columbus Blue Jackets. \nAfter practice, the locker room mood was much different than the night before. Players remain optimistic about the season, and defenseman Erik Johnson noted that the third-period meltdown is bound to toughen the team in future circumstances. \n\"It has to stick with us, maybe a little bit, all year, so it can remind us of what not to do,\" Johnson said. Advertisement \nJohnson's blue-line partner, Francois Beauchemin, said self-inflicted wounds are more easily fixed. \n\"Easy corrections because it's not something that they did. It's something that we did and we have to correct what we do with the puck,\" Beauchemin said. \"We have to make better plays, smarter plays. We know we can score goals, but we have to make sure we can win games 1-0 or 2-1.\" \nRoy will keep the same lineup Saturday against the Dallas Stars as he had with the Wild. He said goalie Semyon Varlamov is not to blame for the Minnesota meltdown. \n\"It's an opportunity for a goalie to close the door. Yes. But we need to help him,\" Roy said. \"We didn't help him in that third period. If you look at the goals that they scored, they were not easy saves. We need to be better, limit the turnovers in the neutral zone and not allow them to get in the slot area. If they score from the outside, it would be different.\" \nJohnson said the Avs were skating backward after the Wild scored to make it 4-2. \n\"You can't be that mentally fragile to let one go in and let it snowball. We really have to buckle down,\" Johnson said. \"We said all the right things going into the third period, but it's just a matter of going out and doing it.\" Dallas at Colorado \nTV/Radio Altitude, 950 AM Spotlight on Patrick Sharp: \nThe three-time Stanley Cup champion who had played for the Chicago Blackhawks since 2005 is beginning his first season in Dallas. The Stars traded defenseman Trevor Daley and forward Ryan Garbutt for Sharp and defenseman Stephen Johns on July 10. Sharp, 33, has produced 30 goals four times, including 34 in 2013-14, when he led the star-studded Blackhawks with 78 points. Dallas also added former Chicago defenseman Johnny Oduya through free agency. NOTEBOOK Stars: \nThey opened with a 3-0 victory over visiting Pittsburgh on Thursday. Goalie Antti Niemi, formerly of San Jose who signed with Dallas as a free agent, had a 37-save shutout. ... Dallas lost all five games to Colorado last season and hasn't beaten the Avalanche since Dec. 17, 2013. ... The Stars' top two lines feature Cody Eakin centering Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin and Jason Spezza between Valeri Nichushkin and Sharp. ... Benn is the reigning Art Ross Trophy winner. He won the scoring title with 87 points (35 goals) last season. Avalanche: \nNo lineup changes for the Avs, who are 100 percent on the power play (2-for-2) and 50 percent on the penalty kill (1-of-2). ... Rookie Mikko Rantanen, 18, had no shots, hits, takaways, giveaways or anything else in his NHL debut Thursday. He played left wing on the third line, with center Carl Soderberg and Borna Rendulic. His total ice time was 7:24. \"We were chasing the puck too much. Didn't get much offense,\" Rantanen said Friday. \"There's little details I need to learn, like in the defensive zone. Of course, it was a tough loss because we led by three goals. I think the second game will be easier. Hopefully, (Saturday) I'll feel a little better.\" \nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers Get sports news and updates right in your inbox \nSign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:03:30.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
