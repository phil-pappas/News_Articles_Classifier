HEAD COACH VIC SHEALY QUOTES On last week’s win heading back into SLC play: ““We didn’t have to play many of our first-team kids past the first quarter this past week, so you get a measure of rest and recovery that you don’t get playing back-to-back conference games, so that’s a huge positive. I’m a big believer that a loss never helped anybody and a win never hurt anybody. Last week was a situation where there was a difference in the athletic ability of the two teams, probably a little reminiscent of a couple of years ago when we lined up against elite teams. We’re excited we got a win, but it’s short-lived, because Central Arkansas and the team they’re developing into, is a big, tall task this week.” On improvement from last year: “It’s always hard to qualify (how improved we are compared to last year). You see areas where we’re getting tougher and playing a little more sure of ourselves, so that you’re able to play a little faster and a little more instinctive. The faces and bodies of the kids look older and the effects of the weight room really start to have an impact on how the kids look. The practices become more competitive and the quality of your number twos become better, so I think you feel like it’s a sum of all those things you try to look at. Obviously, we weren’t very good last year and we’re trying to grow into a team that can line up and compete in this league every week. I know that we’re doing some things on game day that are showing areas of improvement, but we’re still doing some things, be it penalties, turnovers or big plays on defense, that keep us from being competitive. While we’re coaching to try to eliminate those things, we’ve got to significantly improve in order to compete. I know we’re better, but right now it’s just a week-by-week deal as you march through this conference.” On injuries: “After ACU and Sam, we really struggled with injuries. If we had played a conference team this past week, we would’ve had 8-10 kids who normally start for us that wouldn’t have played. I think we get all but two or three back, so we’ll be healthier because of rest. The next few days will determine where some kids are, but certainly we are making improvement and we got a couple of MRIs back that showed that a couple of the injuries are not serious, so we can be more aggressive with treatment to get them back on the field.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:17:18.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
