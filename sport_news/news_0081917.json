He didn’t try to find one, either, knowing that his team would tell him all he needed to know early in Saturday’s showdown with St. Joseph. \nIt turns out the rest didn’t slow down Trifone’s team one bit, as Darien stayed perfect with a 49-7 dismantling of the visiting Cadets. \n“We had two weeks to prepare because we had the bye week last week. We think that helped out a lot,” said quarterback Timmy Graham , who threw for 321 yards and two touchdowns in just over two quarters. “St. Joes, they’re a good football team. … It was our Homecoming, and us seniors knew what we had to do to win this game.” \nDarien opened up leads of 28-0 at halftime and 42-0 midway through the third quarter, as the Cadets (2-1) suffered one of their biggest beatdowns in coach Joe Della Vecchia ’s lengthy tenure. \n“I can’t remember the last time we got beat like that,” Della Vecchia said. “It has to be over 15 years.” \nThe Cadets used a 38-yard completion on a fake punt to march deep into Darien territory on the game’s opening drive, but a missed 27-yard field goal attempt kept it scoreless. It was all downhill from there, as Darien (3-0) scored touchdowns on its first three possessions to open up a commanding 21-0 lead. \nShelby Grant ’s first of two touchdowns, a 27-yard pass from Graham, put the Blue Wave up 7-0 with 3:55 in the first quarter. Colin Minicus scored on the Blue Wave’s next offensive play from scrimmage, taking a screen pass 58 yards for another touchdown. \n“One of our O-coordinators always says, ‘Get the ball to the athletes and let them get to work,’” Graham said. “That’s basically what we were doing.” \nRunning back Christian Trifone contributed three touchdowns on runs of 3, 3 and 2 yards, respectively, as the Blue Wave showed no signs of rust coming off the bye. Through three games, they’ve produced a whopping 147 points. \n“I hadn’t had a bye (in previous years), that I can remember,” Rob Trifone said. “Usually when I’ve had them in rare years, I’ve filled them. It was good to get back on track and playing again.” \nSt. Joseph had played only two games prior to Saturday, although its schedule was set up slightly different than Darien’s. The Cadets didn’t open until Sept. 25, which was actually Week 3 for most teams. \nWins over McMahon and Danbury to start provided some early optimism for the Cadets, but all of that was forgotten following Saturday’s defeat. Della Vecchia was left stewing over missed opportunities, including a Graham fumble that wide receiver Hudson Hamill scooped up and turned into an 18-yard touchdown late in the second quarter. \n“I don’t think I’ve seen anything like that in 32 years,” Della Vecchia said. “I don’t have an explanation for it. I don’t know why we stood there. The other kid made a heads-up play, a great play.” \ndbonjour@ctpost.com; @DougBonjour \nDARIEN 49, ST. JOSEPH 7 \nST.
