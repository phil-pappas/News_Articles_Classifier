Randy Sartin / USA TODAY Sports Oct 8, 2015 at 7:19p ET 0Shares \nTennessee head coach Butch Jones echoed statements made by the school's chancellor Jimmy Cheek Thursday during his weekly radio appearance on 104.5 The Zone’s “3HL\" and denied all rumored allegations of any altercation with a offensive lineman Mack Crowder . \n“I know that the university and our athletics department did their due diligence, and we’re moving forward,” Jones said. “I can tell you this: All the rumors were completely untrue, and it’s very, very unfortunate that we had to go through this for the last couple days. \n“But we’re moving on, and we’re looking forward to competing on Saturday against a very good Georgia football team.” \nCrowder tweeted out his support for Jones Thursday, as the offensive lineman also looks to focus his attention toward the big SEC East showdown this weekend. \n“Get on me about the two-point conversion. Get on me about time management or get on me with those things,” Jones continued. \n“But I think you guys know me by now. I take great pride in my character.” MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
