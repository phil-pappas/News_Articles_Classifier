We are good with it.\" \nThe Highlanders finished second to Grand Haven, 366-345, and nearly 100 points ahead of third-place Oxford. \n\"We went to bed Thursday in first place,\" Mathes said. \"On Friday, we were down a point (213-212) and on Saturday we were down 46 points. We knew that if we won every event and they were disqualified in every event, that was the only way we could win.\" \nThe Highlanders had 10 first-place finishes to Grand Haven's nine, and scored 49 points in the flag race. \nThe MIHA finals were held in a building that was enclosed on three sides, which meant the wide variety of weather that occurred last weekend was a key player. \n\"One of our riders had just finished, and the next rider was out there when hail started hitting the roof,\" Mathes said. \"That horse started going crazy. It sounded like marbles on the roof. It was the luck of the draw. It could have been us.\" \nIt also snowed, rained and sleeted, with temperatures below freezing in the morning all four days. \n\"If the weather had been a little better, it might have been a different outcome,\" Mathes said. \nBut she was pleased nonetheless with the 10 firsts. All of the events are scored by two judges, and three riders earned double firsts. Wyatt Barber, a freshman, had two firsts in the flag race, Courtney Rajala had a double first in poles and Taylor Rajala got two firsts in trail riding. \n\"We had an awesome show,\" Mathes said. \"Everyone did great, the riders and the coaches.\" \nIn Class A, Hartland finished seventh overall with 124 points, six ahead of eighth-place Milford. In Class C. Fowlerville was eighth with 138 points. \nSoccer \nPinckney 4, Ypsilanti Lincoln 0 \nPINCKNEY -- Tatsu Sakuma had all four goals for the Pirates (2-14-1), who won their district opener on their home field. \n\"It's great to get a win, especially in districts,\" Pirates coach Chris Fowler said. \"It was a good team effort. They finally came together. They were so close so many times (to a win), and they put in a quality effort (Monday) and got the result they deserved.\" \nRiley Alexander had eight saves in net for the Pirates, who play the winner of the Jackson-Ann Arbor Pioneer game at 5 p.m. Wednesday at Ann Arbor Huron.
