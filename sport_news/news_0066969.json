Carter plays a big role in that, picking up the early 55-yard gain down the sideline. \nThat would set up quarterback Terry Saul with a touchdown run right up the middle to put the Spartans up 7-0. \nHempstead's Marshon Crowder coughs up the ball on the next possession, and Pleasant Valley recovers. \nTwo snaps later, Arthur Braden breaks off a 45-yard touchdown run to put the Spartans up 14-0 early. \nIn the 2nd quarter, Hempstead finally answers. Quarterback Cole Muehring gets the pass to Crowder, who does the rest. He hurdles one man, makes another man miss, then puts his shoulder down to get into the endzone and pull the game within 7. \nAfter being shut out in the 2nd quarter, the Spartans bust this game wide open in the second half. Hempstead turns the ball over three times and Pleasant Valley scores 35 points to put this one to bed. \nPleasant Valley 49, Dubuque Hempstead 7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:49:38.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
