You've got Jacob deGrom who came in maybe as a little bit of an unknown going up against the great Clayton Kershaw, and he matched him pitch for pitch, put up zeros. His pitch count got a little high early in the game, and to be able to settle down and have a couple quick innings and throw a 7 shutout and get the win against Clayton Kershaw, as an offense, you want to go out there and do something for him so he can scratch out that win. \nSo when (Daniel Murphy) hit the homer, he put up a zero. We got the momentum back, and to be able to tack on runs late in the game, you know, I think that's the key to winning. When you've got deGrom out there throwing the ball as well as he was, I mean, it's just you want to do everything you can to scratch out the win for him.\" \nYour browser does not support iframes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:18:03.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
