The Canucks killed off a tripping penalty on Daniel Sedin earlier in the extra period, but were beaten when Detroit goalie Petr Mrazek fed a stretch pass to Nyquist during a Vancouver change. Nyquist moved in on Ryan Miller and buried his fourth of the season 3:50 into OT. Tomas Tatar had a goal and an assist, Teemu Pulkkinen scored for Detroit and Mrazek stopped 30 shots. Detroit (4-3-1) lost in overtime to Calgary on Friday night. Christopher Tanev and Brandon Sutter scored, and Vancouver (3-2-3) dropped to 0-2-3 at home. Miller made 25 saves. Alexandre Burrows had two assists. Down 2-0 after 40 minutes, the Red Wings got one back when Pulkkinen beat Miller through the five-hole on a breakaway for his fourth of the season at 4:25 of the third. Detroit then went to work on the power play and tied the score when Tatar fired shortside on Miller for his second at 6:59. The Canucks led 2-0 after Sutter's third of the season 8:02 into the second. Moments after Jared McCann hit the post and Sedin had his shot cleared off the goal line, Sutter took a feed from Burrows in front and ripped a shot past Mrazek. Vancouver scored two power-play goals after snapping an ugly 1-for-22 stretch with a man-advantage goal in Thursday's 3-2 loss to the Washington Capitals . Miller was largely untested in the first two periods against a team playing its third game in four nights, but he made a save on Nyquist's shot with a minute to go in the second that just trickled wide. The Canucks blew a third-period lead in that loss to Washington and went after the Red Wings right off the opening faceoff on Saturday. Henrik Sedin tested Mrazek with two good chances inside the first 3 minutes before Burrows was stopped on a short-handed breakaway. Vancouver eventually opened the scoring with 6:57 left in the period on the power play when Tanev took a pass in the slot and fired a shot past Mrazek's glove for his first of the season. Notes: Detroit was without defensemen Mike Green and Kyle Quincey after both suffered injuries against the Flames. ...
