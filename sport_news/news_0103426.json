In last week’s 51-48 win over Centre College, Winn broke his career highs in carries, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns and all-purpose yards. He finished with 283 yards and five rushing touchdowns on 52 carries and 437 all-purpose yards. Each are school records. \nThis performance earned Winn SAA Offensive Player of the Week and was selected to D3Football.com’s National Team of the Week. \nThrough four games, Winn is sixth in the nation in rushing yards with 709 and tied for first with 11 rushing touchdowns. However, both Winn and Buchanan gave credit to the offensive line for Winn’s success. “We always want to go in and establish the run, but our philosophy has always been to put the ball where they aren’t,” Buchanan said. \nBuchanan wasn’t just impressed with the offensive line and Winn’s play against Centre. “The scoreboard doesn’t show it, but I thought our defense played well with the situation we put them in,” he said. “I’m very proud of how they played.” \nIn the two previous meetings between the Warriors and Birmingham-Southern, each team has won in its home stadium. This week, Buchanan said fans shouldn’t expect to see Winn carry the ball 50-plus times. \nLast week, Winn had to run that many times because the other running backs were banged up. \nBuchanan said Mike Goodrich, Mason Millsap and Jordan Zeidman could be in the mix as well as Winn this week against Birmingham. \nPanthers junior quarterback Austin Martin ranks 10th in the conference in passing yards per game with 60.8 yards per game. He has also completed 45.8 percent of his passes. \nJunior running back Samir Usman ranks seventh in rushing yards per game with 64 yards per game. \nThe Birmingham defense ranks sixth in points given up per game with 26.8 points per game. “They’re in a must-win situation this week and they still control their own destiny,” Buchanan said. “We just need to make sure we take care of business.” \nHendrix comes into the game 18th in the nation in total offense, averaging 508.3 yards per game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:09:13.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
