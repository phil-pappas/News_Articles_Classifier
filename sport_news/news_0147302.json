While supply of essential commodities such as milk, vegetables and medicines have been kept out of the purview of the strike, its impact was seen in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, among other places. \"We will continue our strike tomorrow as the government has failed to pay any heed to our demand. The electronic-toll collection system as promised by the government is not practical,\" All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) president Bhim Wadhwa said. Demanding scrapping of the existing toll system and one-time payment of taxes and simplification of TDS procedure, truckers proceeded on an indefinite strike this morning. Wadhwa said the AIMTC has 87 lakh trucks and 20 lakh buses and tempos across the country under its fold and is not ready to withdraw the strike unless some practical solution is made. Appealing the AIMTC to call off the strike earlier in the day, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said the toll system can't be scrapped. \"It is up to them to continue their strike. The government cannot scrap toll. We have already assured to implement electronic tolling system pan-India by December. I appeal to them to call off the strike,\" Gadkari said. Another truckers’ body, All India Transport Welfare Association (AITWA) has decided to keep away from the strike. Gadkari said the government was committed to delivering good highways to transporters and was serious that they did not have to wait at toll plazas. \"E-tolling project of the government is a failed concept... The partnering banks too have distanced themselves from the project,\" Wadhwa said. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:23:11.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
