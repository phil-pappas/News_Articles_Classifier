Sadly for a big crowd that had assembled at the HHS Athletic Complex, the Red & Black were no match for the Vikings, who cruised to a 34-0 victory. Quick Start The Hornets moved the chains during their opening possession as Hornet quarterback Clay Hewlett found junior wide receiver, Nik Krempasky for a 15-yard gainer that Krempasky brought to about midfield. After Hornet senior running back Kyle Strokes was tackled for a loss on the next play, the Hornets went downfield to Galarza who was well covered on the play. After the pass fell incomplete, he called for an interference flag to no avail. On the following play, a 4th a 20 situation in which the Hornets would go for it, Hewlett was sacked for a turnover on downs. On the ensuing Riverside possession, senior quarterback, Kenneth Kielar connected with junior running back, Paul Coleman on a 15 yard pass play that brought the Vikings offense to the Hornets 35 yard line. Vikings senior running back Mikkell Green then took the ball down to the Hornet 15 on a draw play. On a second consecutive draw, Green nearly scored, but was met at the goal line by Hornets senior defensive lineman Jon Sepe, who abruptly ended Green's run at the one yard line. The Vikings continued to hand the ball off to Green until he punched in the game's first score to start the second quarter. On Honesdale's next possession, Hornet running back Strokes suffered a poke to the eye, that allowed senior fullback Luke Davis some more touches. Page 2 of 4 - Unfortunately Davis took some punishing hits while filling in for Strokes, and was unable to pick up the slack created by the sidelined starter. During Riverside's next possession, Honesdale forced a fumble on a botched Riverside hand off, but once again the Vikings defense held the Hornets to a three and out. Relentless Run Game After a towering punt by Galarza that took a bounce that favored the Hornets and rolled to inside the Vikings 10-yard line, the Vikings began moving the ball effectively on the ground. First it was Coleman who broke loose for a twenty plus yard run, bringing the ball out to inside the Viking 35. The it was Green who picked up another 10 yards for a first, taking the ball to about midfield. Coleman got the hand off on the play that followed picking up his second first down of the drive, and the Vikings third consecutive during the possession. Kielar then picked up the Vikings fourth straight first down conversion on a quarterback keeper, laying out for the first down marker as he dove toward the right sideline. As the Vikings earned a fresh set of downs approaching the Hornet's red zone, they handed the ball off to Coleman who rushed the ball up the middle to the one yard line. Then on the following play, it was Coleman again who received a hand off and scampered in for the score, giving his team a 13-0 lead before the extra point conversion made it 14-0. Bees Battle Back The Hornets generated yardage in the closing minute of the first half after Galarza returned a kickoff to near midfield. Page 3 of 4 - Strokes then picked up a first down at about the Vikings 30 yard line, prompting a Hornet time out. On the following play, Hewlett found Krempasky on a well executed play in which Hewlett passed cross field while moving to his left and avoiding a sack. Hewlett then completed a pass to Galarza advancing the ball down to the Viking's 12 yard line. The Hornets then called another timeout with just over eight seconds to go in the half. After they returned to field from the timeout huddle, the Hornets ran what was intended to be a short pass play to Kyle Strokes. Unfortunately for the Hornets, Hewlett's pass was cut off, and intercepted by Vikings defensive back, Cody Glogowski, as time expired in the first half. During the Vikings' opening possession of the second half, it was Coleman again, who took the Vikings from their own thirty five across midfield to the Honesdale 40. Green then followed by carrying the ball the rest of the way, and in for the Riverside touchdown, bringing the already one-sided score to 20-0 at the start of the third quarter. The stingy Riverside defense blanked the Hornets once again during their next possession, forcing the Hornets to punt after a three and out. Galarza's punt went to Riverside wide receiver Kishod Stanton, who after bobbling the catch, regained control of the ball, and returned the punt over eighty yards the other way before he was taken down inside the Hornet's red zone. Riverside wide receiver Joe Austin then received a pitch from Kielar, and took the ball the remaining few yards into the end zone for a Viking touchdown that made it a 27-0 ballgame. Page 4 of 4 - Coleman who had 68 rushing yards on 9 attempts added a final score for Riverside in the contest's closing minutes, paving the way for a 34-0 shutout victory for the visiting Vikings. “ We shot ourselves in the foot a bunch of times during the game,” Hornet head coach Mike Jurkowski admitted. “ We made some mistakes that we couldn't recover from including committing penalties, turning the ball over, and not capitalizing on opportunities to move the ball on offense.” The Hornets move to 2-5 with the loss. For their next gridiron match-up they will travel to Lakeland High School to do battle with the Chiefs (4-3).
