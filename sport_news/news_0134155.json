The doubles specialist, who lost the U.S. Open final to compatriot Flavia Pennetta, failed to convert a match point and was broken as Williams forced a tiebreak.\nWilliams secured an early mini-break as she wrapped the match in just under three hours to reach her 77th career final and first at the fledgling tournament staged in the home town of China's first grand slam singles champion Li Na.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:24:36.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
