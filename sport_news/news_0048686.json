(Jeff Lewis / AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nLamar Odom left a Las Vegas hospital and is now in the Los Angeles area to continue his recovery a week after being found unconscious at a Nevada brothel, a family representative said Tuesday. \nThe former NBA star was transported by helicopter from Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas around 5 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from Alvina Alston, publicist for Odom's aunt JaNean Mercer. She did not say where he has been taken in Los Angeles. \nThe family statement thanked the hospital and Odom's fans and said his estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, his father and his two children from a previous relationship are with him. \n\"He continues to make miraculous progress, taking a few steps in Los Angeles,\" the statement said. \nNews of his release comes a day after a family statement said Odom's condition was improving. It said he was overcoming \"insurmountable obstacles\" and defying the odds. \nOdom was found in extremely critical condition at the Love Ranch brothel in the rural community of Crystal, Nevada, on Oct. 13 and was hospitalized in Las Vegas. He regained consciousness and communicated for the first time Friday. \nThe brothel said workers saw him drink alcohol and take supplements sold as \"herbal Viagra.\" The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in 2013 against one brand he took, Reload, after it was found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra. \nHe also told at least one of the women that he had done cocaine, but the brothel says it did not see him take any drugs or find any there. \nOdom's family, including Kardashian, rushed to his bedside at the Las Vegas hospital. Friends, teammates and loved ones also visited and posted requests for prayers on social media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:16:24.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
