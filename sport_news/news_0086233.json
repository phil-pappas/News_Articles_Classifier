But knowing that I have a final tomorrow ... I have to focus already on the next one.\" \nNo wonder Djokovic continues to find himself in this situation, playing for titles on the final day of tournaments. \nDjokovic will be aiming for his ninth title in what has already been one of the most successful seasons of his career. Not only has he won three Grand Slam titles, he has reached the final in every tournament he has played since the Qatar Open in January when he lost to Ivo Karlovic in the quarterfinals. \nThat's a remarkable 13 consecutive finals and counting. \nMurray looked to have the best chance of stopping that streak on Saturday. Even though Djokovic had won eight of their last nine matches, Murray prevailed in their most recent encounter in Montreal in August and was hoping to carry some momentum into the season-ending ATP finals and Davis Cup final against Belgium. \nBut the Scot had an uncharacteristically poor serving night, dooming his chances. Murray only got 46 percent of his first serves in play and double-faulted six times, including on break point to give Djokovic a 3-1 lead in the second set.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:42:29.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
