Hopefully I can get it done tomorrow. I know I'm playing well at the moment,\" said Tabuena. \n\n\"There are a few players behind me including Lin Wen-tang. But I'm not worried. If he can go low so can I,\" added the 20-year-old. \n\nNiall Turner of Ireland, who is recovering from a back injury, shared fourth place with Taiwan's Lien Lu-sen and Shaun Norris of South Africa. \n\nLeading scores: \n\n133 - Miguel Tabuena (PHI) 68-65 \n\n135 - Natipong Srithong (THA) 70-65, Lin Wen-tang (TPE) 67-68 \n\n136 - Niall Turner (IRL) 70-66, Lien Lu-sen (TPE) 71-65, Shaun Norris (RSA) 68-68 \n\n137 - Keith Horne (RSA) 69-68 \n\n138 - S.
