What we got was containment from the defensive ends and the two interior linemen were pressuring up the middle. It’s been a mentality of working off each other, working with each other, getting off the ball, winning those one-on-one battles when they are available. That’s what has helped us for sure.” \nThe Argos like to rotate their bodies as a way to keep them fresh in the fourth quarter. \nThere’s been stability and continuity with Canadians Laing and Foley and rookies Daryl Waud and Cam Walker, Americans Okpalaugo, Martin Wright and Euclid Cummings. \nDefensive co-ordinator Casey Creehan, who also oversees the defensive line, has shown a knack for calling the right blitz scheme at the right moment, the latest example provided in Monday’s win at Montreal when linebacker Thomas Miles came free off the edge to sack Rakeem Cato. \nWhen four down linemen are controlling the line of scrimmage and pressuring the backfield, it’s a luxury for any co-ordinator. \nLaing feels that none of his defensive linemen are afraid to speak their mind when something needs to be aired. \n“We’re always talking,’’ said Laing. “We’re a band of brothers. We fight like brothers, but we also go to war like brothers. We’ve definitely taken an open eye from the criticism we get from each other and we’re working with it.” \nStampeders’ Bo Levi Mitchell is a big-armed quarterback, one of many elite passers Laing has had to face. \n“We have respect for him, like we do every quarterback we face every week,’’ he said. “To say he instills fear or am I worried about him, yes, he is a great quarterback. \n“But I feel I play my best when I’m comfortable with my opponent knowing I’ve prepared as much as I can.” \nIT'S SIMPLE: WIN AND THEY'RE IN \nThere’s not much to dissect as the Argos venture into the Hammer to play a home game not many are likely to attend on Saturday against Calgary. \nFor the Argos, a win and they are in the post-season following last year’s non-playoff appearance, the first under head coach Scott Milanovich. \nThere are other scenarios and combinations, namely losses by Montreal and B.C., but it’s pretty clear cut in terms of what the Argos need to do to book their ticket to the CFL’s post-season dance. \nA year ago, the Argos lost control of their destiny when they lost a game in Montreal in the next-to-last kickoff, hoping then to have the Alouettes beat the hometown Ticats. \nWhen Hamilton prevailed, the Argos were toast. \nThe Stamps are the only opponent Toronto will face in the coming weeks that features a winning record with games against Montreal, B.C., and Winnipeg on the horizon to close out the regular season. \nToronto has won three in a row heading into Saturday.
