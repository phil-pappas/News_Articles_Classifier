Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said the fees will help enforce the company's established polices, preserve space on crowded trains and reduce safety concerns created by items that are too heavy.\nCustomers are allowed to bring for free two personal items weighing up to 25 pounds and two carry-on bags weighing no more than 50 pounds each. Personal items might include things like a backpack, laptop, purse or other small bags. Passengers with children under the age of 2 also can bring onboard an additional item like a stroller or diaper bag.\nThe fee applies to each item above those limits.\nU.S. airlines started introducing bag fees in 2008 and now charge a standard fee of $25 for the first checked suitcase. Those fees generated $1.6 billion for the airlines in the first quarter of this year.\nBut the airline charges also are more extensive than what Amtrak plans, and Magliari said the train operator didn't start its fees to make more money.\n\"It is simply a space and safety initiative,\" he said.\nHe said the fee was aimed at a small percentage of the company's 31 million passengers who exceed limits for what they can bring onboard for free. Passengers can avoid the fee by checking their bags through to the final destination, if that service is available on their train.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
