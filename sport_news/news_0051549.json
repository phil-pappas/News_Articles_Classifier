I will not shoot you if you give this to the cops.\"\nDowning said he stood up then, and the shooter pointed a gun at him. \"This is the moment I thought I was going to die,\" Downing said.\nInstead, the shooter paused for a moment, Downing said, and handed him the envelope. Next, the shooter told Downing to sit in the very back seat and face him.\nDowning did so and said at that point Harper-Mercer fired into the center of the room and began asking students one by one if they were religious. The shooter fired at one student who said he was Christian and another who said she was Catholic.\nThe shooter reloaded two handguns with ammunition from his backpack during the killings, Downing said. Harper-Mercer was \"firing on people who were just lying there,\" Downing said.\nDowning also said the shooter seemed to lose interest when a woman told him she couldn't move her legs to stand up because of the pain.\nHe turned to another woman, telling her to stand, and she picked up a desk to defend herself, Downing said. Harper-Mercer fired at her anyway, hitting her in the leg.\nWhen the shooter noticed police, he leaned out a window and fired at them. Downing also wrote that after Harper-Mercer was hit by police gunfire, he lay down on the floor and shot himself in the head.\nHarper-Mercer killed nine people and wounded nine others.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
