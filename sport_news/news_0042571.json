Otago fighters gained two titles at the nationals in Invercargill last week. \nQueenstown's Richie Hadlow defeated Hutt Valley's Talu Latu in the final of the open men's light welterweight, while Dunedin's Kasib Murdoch won the cadet 54kg title, beating Hutt Valley's Zac Jenson. \nMurdoch, a year 10 pupil at Kaikorai Valley College, has forged an impressive reputation on the wrestling mat but has turned his attention to boxing this year and fought very well in what was a straight final. \nHe pushed forward the entire fight and piled the pressure on Jenson to record a deserved win. \nHadlow's fight with Latu was a much closer affair but he won the decision, while Dunedin-based boxer Sam Beck, who fought under the Manawatu banner, was defeated in the final of the elite men's middleweight by North Harbour's Nathan Johnstone. \nIt was perhaps a decision which could have gone either way. \nBridget Sefton, who trains in Dunedin but also fought for Manawatu, was also a beaten finalist. \nShe lost by unanimous decision to Te Arani Daniels in the final of the elite 75kg division. \nDaniels was able to get forward and land the more convincing blows.
