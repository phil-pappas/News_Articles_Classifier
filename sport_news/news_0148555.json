Three Grade A eggs in the same basket.\nThere’s the second group of Mark Scheifele between Mathieu Perreault and super-rookie Nikolaj Ehlers, three more offensively-gifted players who aren’t out there to be plumbers.\nThere’s the fourth combo: rookies Andrew Copp and Nic Petan with the veteran muscle of Chris Thorburn. Agitators with a touch, the Jets are hoping.\nSo what, exactly, are Lowry, Stafford and Burmistrov, other than three NHLers who’ve never played together before?\nA defensive shut-down unit?\n“It looks like they score-goal guys, I’m stay-at-home guy,” is how Burmistrov put it, Tuesday. “You can’t say it’s a checking line, right? Staff is a real skilled guy, and really good defensively. Same with Lows, good offensively, good defensively.\n“I hope I’m still not bad offensively.”\nBurmistov is smiling, but he’s probably dead-serious.\nThe last time he was in the NHL he managed just four goals in 44 games. That was three seasons ago.\nAfter two years in Russia’s KHL, he’s the biggest unknown on a line that’s hard to get a handle on.\nHead coach Paul Maurice Tuesday described Burmistrov as “a bit of a rookie in some ways.”\nHe also joked that Lowry, the second-year vet, is already “an old man.”\nStafford, the real elder statesman of the trio, is taking it upon himself to lead this chemistry experiment by facilitating the communication.\n“A guy like Burmi coming over from Russia, the game’s a little bit different here,” Stafford said. “Same with Lows, picking him up as a young player. Hopefully it doesn’t take too long, if we do create something.”\nThe man who’s mixed these ingredients together and who’s determining their role, of course, is Maurice.\nAnd he sees this new concoction as one that can play against the other team’s best without getting burned, while creating a little sizzle themselves.\n“Three smart guys,” is how the coach began his description. “So we see them being able to handle big minutes. And it’s a role we want to push Adam in. But when you play against better offensive players, you also get your chance, too. So we picked Staff there on the right.”\nJob 1, though, is to limit the stars on the other team, the assignment Little, Ladd and the departed Michael Frolik drew much of last year.\nThat’s a big job. But if they can handle it, it frees up the top two lines a little.\n“It’s a good blend of speed, size and skill,” Lowry said. “It’s going to be important minutes. We’re going to try our best to play with the puck in the other team’s defensive zone. We’re going to try and hopefully give some lighter matchups to other lines and we’re looking forward to that challenge.”\nMaurice has talked a lot about building his lineup to suit Lowry’s emerging talents, a compliment to the second-year man, to be sure.\n“It’s obviously nice to hear those things,” Lowry said. “But things can change on a daily basis. It’s obviously a results-driven business. I had a strong second half (last year). I got a lot more comfortable as the season went along. So I’m going to look to build off that. And hopefully we find some chemistry on our line.”\nMaybe they’ll even forge an identity.\nActually, they’ll have to. Because nobody likes defined roles more than Maurice.\nBeginning Thursday, the three ingredients become a dish.\nThe flavour of which remains to be seen.\nPAUL FRIESEN\nThe great unknown: Winnipeg Jets third line a bit of a mystery\nBy Paul Friesen , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 06, 2015 08:04 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 06, 2015 11:26 PM EDT\nThey’re a bit of an odd trio, a little of this and a little of that — almost like three leftover ingredients tossed into a stew.\nAn experiment that’s both hard to categorize and impossible to predict.\nI’m talking about the Winnipeg Jets’ third line: Adam Lowry between Drew Stafford and Alex Burmistrov.\nWe know it’s a line because it has one centre and two wingers and was skating as a unit in practice, Tuesday.\nIt took faceoffs like a line, made rushes like a line and even sits in the same corner of the locker-room — just as any line might do.\nBut, really, what is it?\nLooking at the Jets lineup, it’s easy to define the other combinations.\nThere’s the high-octane, veteran scoring unit of Bryan Little, Blake Wheeler and Andrew Ladd – the top three point producers from last season.
