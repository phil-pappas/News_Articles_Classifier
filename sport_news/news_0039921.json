The Tirana court acquitted Ardian Fullani on Monday, rejecting a request from the prosecutor for a five-year jail sentence, prosecutor general spokesman Albi Serani said. The prosecutor would appeal the verdict, he added. Fullani was charged with abuse of office in 2014 over the theft of 713 million leks (worth $6.5 million at the time) found to be missing from the Bank of Albania's reserves. He was also charged with abuse of office for allegedly violating procedures in the purchase of a hotel. Sixteen other former central bank employees have been jailed and one more is awaiting trial in the case.
