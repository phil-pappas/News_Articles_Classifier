It will be his first time meeting with the team and being examined by their doctors since early September, when he tried to convince the team he was ready prior to Week 1.\nFox Sports' Jay Glazer, who first reported the meeting, also said that JPP had asked the Giants to have Nike make him a special glove for his injured hand, but the Giants declined his request since technically Pierre-Paul is not a Giant. He is a \"franchise\" free agent, since he has yet to sign his one-year, $14.8 million franchise tag.\nWhen JPP met with the Giants in Sept., the Giants determined he was nowhere close to being ready to play, according to a team source, and the damage to his hand was worse than they expected. He is, of course, missing his right index finger, and his recovering from a fractured thumb and burns on his hand. He also reportedly is missing a small part of his middle finger.\nThe full extent of the damage was visible in exclusive photos obtained and published by the Daily News.
