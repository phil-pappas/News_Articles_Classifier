But they thought a punt was exactly what the Patriots would be expecting, so why not outsmart them?\nWhat a cunning strategy, right?\nWrong.\nThe Pats had every reason to be pumped up after benefiting from the Colts’ blunder. Source: AP\nWith only wide receiver Griff Whalen and safety Colt Anderson anywhere near the ball, the Colts made the incredible decision to snap the pigskin.\nIt was supposed to be the bluff to end all bluffs. The trick play to end all trick plays. And it may well have been, if it didn’t fail spectacularly, that is. Whalen hiked the ball and Anderson was immediately tackled for a yardage loss in an embarrassing few seconds for anyone involved with the Colts organisation.\nNormally the coach calls the plays, but Colts mentor Chuck Pagano was as baffled as everyone else when he saw what happened, asking Whalen: “Why did you snap that?”\nWATCH THE INCIDENT IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE\nThe amusing stuff-up gave the Patriots the ball on the Colts’ 36-yard line after a flag was thrown for an illegal formation, and they took full advantage by driving downfield to score a touchdown and earn a 34-21 lead.\nAs with all funny mistakes made on a grand scale, the Twittersphere was buzzing with some choice commentary on the play.\nI&apos;m not entirely sure what The Colts were trying on that illegal formation play. Not sure they knew either, worst play since the Butt Fumble\n— Ø (@kyle_etidiot) October 19, 2015 I could watch that Colts play forever. What even was that lmao\n— Katja (@applessquabble) October 19, 2015 The worlds dumbest play… They&apos;ll never see it coming!\n— mark schlereth (@markschlereth) October 19, 2015 20 minutes after that #Colts play and I&apos;m still like pic.twitter.com/SNavFGtNA9\n— Andrew Luck (@FauxAndyLuck) October 19, 2015 New banner going up at Lucas Oil Stadium pic.twitter.com/T5qYaC9DJH\n— Steve Silva (@stevesilva) October 19, 2015 Just gonna bury my head in the sand regarding that Colts &apos;trick play&apos;. Unbelievable.\n— Oli Court (@AnotherOli) October 19, 2015 Pagano took responsibility for the failed play, saying he “didn’t do a good enough job of coaching it (the play) during the week”.\n“I take responsibility there,” Pagano said.\n“Alignment-wise, we weren’t lined up correctly and then a communication breakdown between the quarterback and snapper. That’s all on me. I take full responsibility on that, and I didn’t do a good enough job getting that communicated to the guys.”\nColts punter Pat McAfee said what everyone was thinking.\n“It turned out to be one of the most failed fakes probably of all time,” he said.\nThe Patriots went on to win 34-27, thanks largely to quarterback Tom Brady, who piloted a seven-play, 80-yard touchdown drive to open the third quarter, capping it with a 25-yard scoring pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski.\nBrady completed 23 of 37 passes for 312 yards. His first interception of the season was returned for a touchdown, but the Pats improved to 5-0 — their 183 points this season breaking the club record for most through the first five games set in 2007.\n— with AFP", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Colts?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/markschlereth/status/655942110252679169", "https://twitter.com/kyle_etidiot/status/656038065073475584", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/42b79fce668123565bcc414e0609fb02", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F19%2FDVU_181015_NFL_WORST_PLAY_EVER_COLTS_PKG.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "https://twitter.com/applessquabble/status/656036898041892864", "https://twitter.com/AnotherOli/status/656032318956642304", "http://t.co/T5qYaC9DJH", "https://twitter.com/FauxAndyLuck/status/655946714013114368", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3d036d03d031a11382560edc741a8059", "https://twitter.com/stevesilva/status/655951478201257984", "http://t.co/SNavFGtNA9", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:47:06.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
