(AP) — Ulysses Bryant scored two touchdowns and Brandon Behr kicked three field goals as Jacksonville survived a late comeback to remain unbeaten and defeat Morehead State 30-26 on Saturday. \nThe Dolphins (4-0, 2-0 Patriot League) jumped out to a 24-7 halftime lead but only scored on a pair of Behr field goals in the second half while Morehead State (2-3, 1-1) rallied. \nAustin Gahaffer found Justin Cornwell for scoring passes of 11 and 9 yards, and Shavi Bash added two field goals for the Eagles. Bash’s 32-yarder pulled Morehead State to 30-26 with 4:40 left to play. Jacksonville, which had a blocked punt and an interception end its two previous drives, steadied to run out the clock with a 10-play drive. \nJamal Adjamah rushed for 163 yards, Bryant added 114, and Bell passed for 351 yards and two touchdowns. Jacksonville is not eligible for the conference championship. \nGahaffer went 32-of-53 for 324 yards with three TDs.
