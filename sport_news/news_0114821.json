Tight end Eric Ebron practiced after sitting out the last two games with a knee injury.\nTight end Brandon Pettigrew (knee), safety James Ihedigbo (quadriceps), nickel back Josh Wilson and linebacker DeAndre Levy did not practice for the Lions. Levy is out, likely for the year, following hip surgery.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nLions' Levy back walking after hip surgery\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com. @davebirkett .\nDownload our free Lions Xtra app on your Apple and Android devices.", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/davebirkett", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/25625a8cc65e01426d485d803775f2c67f6d7fe9/c=0-224-3443-3667/local/-/media/2015/10/01/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635793084189959441-AP-Lions-Minicamp-Football-o.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:01:59.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
