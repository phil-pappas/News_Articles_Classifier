(OzarksSportsZone.com) -- For the past two months, Marquette’s Annah Junge had primarily been a JV pitcher. On Friday at the 2015 MSHSAA State Softball Championships in Springfield, she was pitching Marquette past Joplin and into the Class 4 state title game. Junge corralled a veteran Joplin lineup, striking out 13 and allowing just four hits over seven innings as the Mustangs defeated the Eagles 7-1 in a morning semifinal matchup.“I thought we had some chances early offensively,” said Joplin coach Kirk Harryman. “I’m not going to take anything away from (Marquette’s pitcher), I thought she pitched well. But I thought we got away from some things in our plans at the plate and the process that has gotten us this far. I thought we pressed a little bit as the game went on, which kind of went into (Junge’s) hands.\" Only a freshman, Junge seemed like a calm, experienced pitcher against Joplin, allowing one walk, one HBP and a Courtney Shryock RBI single in the fourth inning that accounted for Joplin’s lone run of the game. Junge struck out the Joplin side in the first two innings. According to an Oct. 23 article on stlhighschoolsports.com , she was Marquette’s JV pitcher for most of the regular season.“I bet their JV team was really good,” Harryman said. “She just worked in and out, up and down, and she did a nice job. She let her defense work. We didn’t quite make the adjustments. We got away from our plan at the plate and things that had made us successful in the playoffs up to this point.” Despite their struggles at the plate, Joplin was still in the game after five innings. BOX SCORE: JOPLIN VS. MARQUETTE SEMIFINALS That’s when a treacherous and bad-luck sixth inning doomed the Eagles’ chances. Marquette, utilizing three straight bunts at one point, scored four runs in the top of the sixth off two hits and two Joplin errors. The first run came on a delayed squeeze play after Joplin fielded a bunt and tried to look the runner back to third, only to have her come home and score after the throw was made to first for the second out of the inning. Leading 3-1, Marquette’s final three runs of the inning came with two outs. Sydney Dana had an RBI single to make it 4-1. With runners on the corners, Joplin misplayed another Marquette bunt attempt, allowing two more Mustang runs to score.“All in all, Marquette made all the plays they needed to and that’s the game,” Harryman said. “They just played better than we did. You have to tip your cap to them.” The Eagles had two potential outs taken away by the officials in the sixth inning, first on a foul ball caught by first baseman Jenessa Pasimio-Field that was ruled to have hit the ground. Dana, the batter on the play, would soon hit an RBI single to make it 4-1. Later, Joplin fielded a Marquette bunt that was rolling up the third baseline and made the throw over to first in time for the out, but the umpire ruled the ball was in foul territory when fielded. A Joplin error just moments later allowed two more Marquette runs to come across, making it 6-1.“Those were two plays where I thought we were out of the inning,” Harryman said. “But that’s softball. That’s things that are out of our control. We had some opportunities to make some plays after that and we didn’t.“It’s disappointing because that’s something we’ve been doing a good job with in this little run we’ve had.” Marquette took a 2-0 lead in the third inning as Megan Clince hit a 2-run homer over the center field fence. Senior pitcher Michaela Sennett threw all seven innings for Joplin, allowing seven runs (five earned) on six hits and four walks while striking out 11. Joplin would play in the Class 4 3rd place game about an hour and a half after the loss to Marquette. In the 3 rd place game, the Eagles lost 4-1 to Marquette to finish the season 26-9 overall. It was Joplin’s first trip to state in program history. The team graduates eight senior starters.“Our seniors are awesome,” Harryman said. “I got to coach them one more time (in the 3 rd place game) and our underclassmen got to play with them one more time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:43:23.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
