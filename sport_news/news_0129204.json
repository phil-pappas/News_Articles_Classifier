I would say the biggest thing I see there is they’re starting to understand the value of communication.” \nThat communication was on display Saturday night as the Gators only allowed two sacks to an Ole Miss front seven that is considered one of the best in the country. \nFor an offensive line that had 10 combined starts entering the season — third-fewest nationally — and has at times played three true freshmen at once, it’s a testament to how rapid the growth has been. \n“It’s really surprising to me,” transfer offensive lineman Mason Halter said about the youngsters’ play. “From high school to college, it was a big jump even for me, and I didn’t play my freshman year. I’m really impressed with these kids. ... They’re learning at an exponential rate, and their potential is great.” \nOne in particular is five-star freshman offensive tackle Martez Ivey, who missed the first two games of the year with a knee injury but has made an immediate impact upon his return. Although he hasn’t started, he’s been in the regular rotation at tackle and even saw time at guard during the 38-10 win over the Rebels. \n“He’s responding like a veteran,” Halter said of Ivey. “He’s obviously very good at offensive line in general, and he can kick into guard like that. He’s just a physical body in there, and he dominates defenders.” \nHalter believes part of the growth collectively up front came from facing Florida’s own defensive line each day in practice. \nThe Gators are tied for sixth in the nation with 18 sacks this season and are tied for third with 46 tackles for loss. Halter says those guys have helped prepare the offensive line for its opposition. \n“Ole Miss had a great defensive line, but our defensive line is just, in my eyes, so much better,” Halter said. “I mean, I get to work one-on-one with Jon Bullard every day. It’s helped me so much.” \nAs Florida gets deeper into its SEC schedule, even more growth will be needed as the tests get tougher — like Missouri this week, a team that ranks second nationally with 48 tackles for loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:50:31.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
