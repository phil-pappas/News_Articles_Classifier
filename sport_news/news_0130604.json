The Serb now boasts a 38-1 win loss record on the Chinese hardcourts.\nTsonga will be comforted by his strong showing in China, which helped move him up to ninth in the race to qualify for the eight man end-of-season ATP Tour Finals in London next month.\nDjokovic, however, was left looking for more records after securing his 57th ATP Tour title and moving within two of Nadal's mark of 27 Masters Series crowns after taking his prize money for the year past a record $16 million.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:05:50.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
