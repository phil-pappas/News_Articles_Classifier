We talked about loud environments. ... The guys that took the discredit for the penalties certainly stood so and did it so in front of their team. ... They have great awareness, and they recognize it now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:29:40.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
