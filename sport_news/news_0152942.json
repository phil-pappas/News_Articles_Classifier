Would the Frogs slow the game down to keep Texas Tech's offense on the sideline or would it go about business as usual?\nTCU gashed Texas Tech a year ago with 305 rushing yards and three touchdowns. Coming into this game, the Red Raiders' defense had been giving up an average of 257 rushing yards per game, which was fifth most in the nation.\nTCU finished with 223 rushing yards, but largely attacked the Red Raider secondary with Trevone Boykin throwing for 509 yards and and four touchdowns.\nMeanwhile, DeAndre Washington finished with 188 rushing yards and four touchdowns, which is the most since he had 186 yards on 20 carries against Iowa State a season ago. The last time a Patterson-led team had an opposing 100-yard rusher was in the 61-58 loss to Baylor when Shock Linwood had 178 yards on 29 carries.\n2) Patrick Mahomes' ability to run\nOne of Texas Tech's best weapons on offense is Mahomes' ability to run. He wasn't able to fully utilize that after the team's second drive. He dove for the pylon to try and score and came up limping, and a knee brace was eventually put on his left knee. Mahomes was able to break off a small run here and there, but his mobility wasn't the same after that play.\nThe quarterback entered this game with 21 carries for 129 yards and four rushing touchdowns. His dual-threat ability has helped Tech's rushing game as well as its passing game by keeping plays alive.\nWhen his running ability was taken away, TCU was able to focus on the running back on read-option plays or send defensive backs into coverage with four-man rush.\n3) Special teams was supposed to be in TCU's favor\nComing into this game, TCU was thought to be heavily favored in the special teams area compared to Texas Tech. Jaden Oberkrom came into this game with 59 made field goals in his career. Texas Tech's two kickers were a combined 3-4 entering the game.\nOberkrom had a field goal blocked early in the first half and ended up missing a 25-yard try that would have given TCU an eight point lead.\n4) Josh Doctson's monstrous day\nWith Colby Listenbee sidelined, Josh Doctson stepped up in a big way. Boykin leaned on him heavily in the first half completing 11 passes on 13 targets to the 6-3 senior. He snagged three touchdowns in that first half and had a total of 184 yards, and, according to TCU's football Twitter account, would have been the third most on any Gary Patterson team for an entire game.\nHe finished with 267 yards on 18 receptions (tying a Big 12 record) and three touchdowns.\n5) Horned Frogs shot themselves in the foot a couple times on defense\nWith all the injuries to the defense, the Horned Frogs were going to need to take every positive possible, especially against the Red Raiders' high-powered offense.\nOn two separate possessions, both of which TCU was leading at that point of the game, junior defensive end Josh Carraway committed roughing the passer penalties to extend the drive for Texas Tech.\nThe first came on Texas Tech's fifth possession of the game with TCU leading 16-14. The Red Raiders would have had a three and out, but Carraway's penalty nullified an incompletion. The Red Raiders scored on a 44-yard touchdown to Jakeem Grant on the very next play.\nThe second instance came when TCU was leading 33-28 in the third quarter. The TCU hit Mahomes for a 2-yard loss on a third and goal situation, but the drive was extended when Carraway slammed the Texas Tech quarterback to the ground. DeAndre Washington scored on the very next play.\nMistakes like that can't happen when the defense is shorthanded and TCU is competing in a close game.\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-09-27T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:38:23.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
