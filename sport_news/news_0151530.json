Despite his status for Friday’s match at Wembley being in question, Rooney will remain with the England squad this week but it remains to be seen whether he will travel to Lithuania for the Three Lions’ final qualifier next Monday.\nEngland has already qualified for next year’s finals in France, having recorded eight wins from eight matches so far in Group E.\nGroup A\nIceland will appear at its first major tournament and will be joined at Euro 2016 next summer by the Czech Republic but third place, and a play-off berth, in Group A is very much still up for grabs.\nTurkey has a two-point edge over the Netherlands with two matches to go but face a difficult trip to Prague to take on the Czechs Saturday, while the Dutch make the long trip east where Kazakhstan await Danny Blind’s side.\nThree days later, the Dutch will return home to host the Czech Republic in Amsterdam while Turkey, whose thumping 3-0 win over the Netherlands last month gives them the tie-breaker should the two sides end on the same number of points, entertain Iceland.\nTurkey has been boosted by the inclusion of Galatasaray striker Burak Yilmaz, scorer of four goals in six qualifiers, in Fatih Terim’s squad having recovered in time from a hamstring injury.\nHowever, the Dutch will be without captain Arjen Robben with the Bayern Munich star still sidelined by a groin injury, while midfielder Davy Klaassen and winger Quincy Promes have also been forced to withdraw due to injury.\nGroup leader Iceland, ahead of Czech Republic on goal difference, hosts Latvia at the weekend before its trip to Turkey.\nGroup B\nWales can clinch its place in France next year with a point from its final two matches, while Belgium can also punch its ticket with a win away to Andorra Saturday.\nChris Coleman’s Wales face a stern test away to Bosnia, which enter the weekend two points adrift of Israel in the race for third, but the Welsh will be confident of wrapping up qualification at home to Andorra in their final match if it comes to that.\nGareth Bale returned for Real Madrid in Sunday’s 1-1 draw against city rivals Atletico, coming on a second-half substitute after three weeks out with a calf injury, and will again be central to his country’s hopes.\nIn the event of an unlikely slip-up in Andorra, Belgium can nail down a qualifying spot by avoiding defeat to Israel on Oct. 13.\nIsrael, which like Wales is looking to reach the European Championships for the first time, hosts Cyprus before travelling to Brussels three days later.\nBosnia must win at least one of its remaining games against Wales or away to Cyprus to have a chance of overhauling Israel, while the Cypriots are still in contention as well but must beat Israel and Bosnia and hope the former do not beat Belgium.\nGroup C\nTwo-time reigning European champion Spain will be heavily favoured to book its place in France when it hosts Luxembourg Friday.\nLa Roja have won six straight qualifiers following a shock setback in Slovakia but will be without Diego Costa for the double-header, with Luxembourg and Ukraine, after coach Vicente del Bosque opted to leave him at home.\nBarcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta also misses out through injury along with Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos, who pulled out of the squad on Tuesday having yet to fully overcome the effects of a dislocated shoulder.\nSlovakia can also assure themselves of a place at Euro 2016, for what would be its debut in the continental event, with a win in either of its last two matches against Belarus or Luxembourg.\nUkraine is third, three points behind Slovakia, and appears destined for the play-offs with a minimum of four points from games in Macedonia and against Spain in Kiev three days later required, along with other results working in their favor. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:38:54.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
