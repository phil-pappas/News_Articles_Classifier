And your lunch got lost somewhere in a pile of meetings, unexpected emergencies or kids' crises. Breakfast may be viewed as the most important meal of the day, but lunch is nothing to sneeze at. Run around for hours without fuel, and your blood sugar starts to dive; your metabolism slows as your body goes into starvation mode. Your focus and energy start to wane. Plus, skipping lunch can lead to overeating later when you're starving. The solution? Keep a stash of healthy food at your desk, says Monique Costello , a certified integrative health coach and culinary nutrition expert with clients throughout the suburbs. \"Being prepared is the key to being healthy. Stocking your desk with staples that offer you nutritional boosts like protein, fiber and magnesium (think seeds -- chia, hemp, pumpkin and sunflower) will help keep you satiated longer and help keep your system working,\" Costello says. \"And you can focus on work instead of scrounging for leftover food in the company kitchen.\" A study at Cornell University in 2013 showed that the negative effects of skipping a meal -- such as overeating later -- can be abated by a small, healthy snack. In the study, 68 meal-skippers, after a five-hour fast, were either given food (wheat crackers) to reduce their hunger or not given any food. They were then asked to make purchases at a simulated grocery store. The hungry shoppers who did not eat crackers bought almost 19 percent more food, including 31 percent more high-calorie snacks. \"Make sure you don't skip a meal, or at least have a snack like apples or string cheese in your office,\" says study co-author Brian Wansink. To avoid this urge to overeat after work, stock your desk with some essentials, says Costello. I attended a recent lunch class taught by Costello and came away armed with a lot of practical ideas that I can fit in my crazy schedule. Costello suggests you stock your desk, stock your freezer and get the right containers. For your desk • Olive and nut oils • Vinegar (look for sample size jars of oil and vinegar, then keep refilling them; you should also store in a dark place) • Herbs (salt and pepper, cinnamon, dried herbs, turmeric) • Jar of almond butter • Nuts and seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame, chia, hemp, almonds, walnuts, pecans) • Honey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:21:14.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
