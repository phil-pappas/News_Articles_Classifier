Related Links Photos: Coal City vs. Sandwich football \nThe Bulldogs ended the half with an 11-play, 74-yard touchdown drive that spanned 1:14 of game time. \nAll 11 plays were passes, and while only three were complete, the Coalers gifted Streator a personal-foul for a first down on a third-and-10 to go with two earlier first-down completions. \nAnd on fourth-and-10 from the 33, Bulldogs quarterback Christina Price found Isaiah Jones for a 33-yard touchdown that made it a 14-6 game with the Bulldogs set to receive the second-half kickoff. \nAlong with lost momentum, the Coalers went into the second half uncertain whether Streator would go back to trying to establish the run – 15 of its first 20 plays were rushes – or continue to throw the ball the way it had late, and with some success. \nStreator coach Brian Hassett’s history also weighed on Coal City coach Lenny Onsen’s mind as he prepared his troops at intermission. \nThe Bulldogs tried to go back to a balanced attack early in the second half, and while Price’s first attempt of the third quarter went for 18 yards to Austin Araujo, the Coaler pass defense took over from there. Price and Derek Henson, who relieved Price in the fourth quarter, completed only one pass the rest of the way, and the Coalers had three interceptions. \n“Coach Hassett, he’s thrown the ball a lot in his career, so we’ve seen that, but I thought our defense made some nice answers, made some plays, and I thought our defensive line pressured,” Onsen said. Coal City had intercepted Price twice in the first half, but both resultant drives ended in punts. \nIn the second half, two of Streator’s turnovers led to Coaler points as a close game turned into a blowout. A Danny Kroeger pick on the first play of the fourth quarter led to a Joe Starkey touchdown run, and a Brad Littleton interception of Henson’s first pass attempt produced a Nick Hayden score. The Coaler defense tried to respect the run, but the secondary became much more aggressive, breaking on passes as soon as they were thrown. \n“Right at the end of the half, we started noticing that they were getting a lot of passes in on us,” Kroeger said. “They completed a lot of passes on us, and we just tried to compete with the pass and deal with the run at the same time.” \nOnsen said his defense’s second-half dominance – other than on Todd Dunkleburger’s late 53-yard touchdown run, the Bulldogs ran only one play in Coaler territory – was more a credit to his players than to schematic adjustments. \n“The kids just kind of did some better defensive things on their own – they made better breaks and played better coverage,” Onsen said, “and I think the pressure up front helped too, changing things up a little bit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:56:13.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
