Thats pretty rare if youve been around quite a few locker rooms. Kyler is a special individual, he has a big heart, he cares about his friends, and he cares about his family, his wife and his daughter. Hes just an all-around really good guy at the core.”\nFormer USU teammate Zach Vigil\nWhen Kyler Fackrell arrived in Cache Valley, Utah State’s football program had just wrapped up its second season under former head coach Gary Andersen.\nThe Aggies went 4-8 in 2010 under Andersen, but it was their 13th consecutive losing season. During those lean years, Utah State suffered through a stretch where it lost 16 in a row and won just twice in 29 games.\nTimes have certainly changed since then and blue-collar players like Fackrell are a big reason why. Since Fackrell’s arrival on campus in 2011, the Aggies have compiled a 41-21 overall record, played in four-consecutive bowl games and won three-straight bowl games, both of which are school records.\nThe 6-foot-5, 250-pound senior linebacker, who redshirted in 2011, is back on the field for the Aggies after suffering a season-ending knee injury in the second quarter of the 2014 opener at Tennessee.\n“It’s awesome being back,” Fackrell said. “It still has taken me a little bit to really truly get back into it. It is different to play in real games, but it’s been amazing to come out and play with these guys again. To be able to stand on the sideline, to try and contribute and win a game with my teammates is a lot of fun.”\nThrough the first five games of his senior season, Fackrell ranks fourth on the team in tackles with 26, including 8.0 tackles for loss and 3.0 sacks, both of which lead the Aggies. He also has a team-best eight quarterback hurries, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.\nWith his 8.0 tackles for loss, Fackrell ranks first in the Mountain West and 17th in the nation. He is also second in the MW and tied for third nationally in fumbles recovered (0.40 pg), fourth in the MW and 66th nationally in sacks (0.60 pg), tied for sixth in the MW in fumbles forced (0.20 pg) and tied for 41st in the MW in tackles (5.2 pg).\n“When you talk about Kyler, you talk about a guy that has tremendous talent,” said former Utah State linebacker Zach Vigil, who is in his rookie season with the Miami Dolphins. “When we played Northern Illinois in the Poinsettia Bowl, their whole game plan was to stop Kyler. When you hear stuff like that, it shows you the kind of respect he demands when he’s on the field.”\nAnd while Fackrell has helped turn the Aggies into a consistent winner, there is still something he would like to accomplish before leaving Logan. The Preseason Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year would love nothing more than to help Utah State capture a title.\n“There is, just like there has been, a big sense of urgency for us to win and hopefully get that Mountain West Conference championship,” Fackrell said.\nPlaying in his first game back since suffering the season-ending knee injury against Tennessee, it didn’t appear as if Fackrell had missed any time at all. After all, the former three-sport star at Mesa High School had five tackles, including a career-high 2.5 tackles for loss and a career-high-tying 2.0 sacks, in Utah State’s 12-9 victory against Southern Utah on Sept. 3.\n“He brings consistency to the table every day,” Vigil said. “Kyler is a guy who is going to work hard for you, especially the last couple of years that I was there with him. It was unfortunate that he got hurt last year. He was set up to have a really good year.”\nFackrell currently ranks tied for 10th all-time in school history with 125 interception return yards. Most of that came on a 99-yard pick-six, which ranks as the third-longest interception return in school and MW history, against Hawai’i on Nov. 12, 2013.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team100.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:13:53.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
