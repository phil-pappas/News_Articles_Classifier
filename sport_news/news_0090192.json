Duminy on Wednesday said this was one of his best knocks ever, as the visitors beat India by seven wickets in the first T20 international here on Friday. Duminy and Farhaan Behardien put on an unbeaten partnership of 105 runs for the fourth wicket to steer South Africa home chasing a stiff target of 200. “Definitely one of my best innings . The way we started the innings was what we wanted in the chase . We batted quite well in the middle and built a good partnership with fudge(Behardien). We both said we have to take it on, we don’t want to die wondering towards the end,” Duminy said at the post-match presentation ceremony. The Proteas needed just 10 runs of the last over which was bowled by left-arm pacer Sreenath Aravind. After a few good deliveries in the block-hole, Aravind missed his line and Duminy clobbered him into the stands for a huge six, thus killing off the contest. “We knew if we could get it down to 10-11 off the last over, we had a good chance . Fortunately enough, the left-armer missed his lengths and gave me an opportunity. It’s a long tour for us but we have started well and we are happy with this performance,” he said.
