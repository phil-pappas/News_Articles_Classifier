I’ve always had confidence in myself and the guys to do it. Tonight we kind of just put it together when we needed to late in the game. It was a great win for the team.” \nObviously it wasn’t so great for Malzahn. \nHe saw his team rebound from 14-0 tie it 14-14 then respond to tie it 21-21 and 24-24 before the twists and turns in overtime. \n“First of all that was a tough one,” Malzahn said. “No doubt about it. Our guys played with a lot of heart You have to give Arkansas credit. They responded numerous times when they had to. They made plays and we just didn’t get it done.” \nAsked about Louis’ drop during the fourth overtime, Malzahn said, “Ricardo made two plays to send it to overtime. That (the OT drop) is a tough deal.” \nArkansas’ overtime also highlighted Walker, summoned especially in the second half with lead running back Alex Collins 25 carries for 105 yards a 7-yard touchdown, banged up and backup freshman Rawleigh Williams (hospitalized with a third-quarter neck injury but conscious and moving his extremities, Bielema said. Walker rushed for 3 and 4-yard overtime touchdowns. \nAlso in Arkansas’ overtime, Allen threw an overtime 2-point pass to tight end Jeremy Sprinkle and Cole Hedlund, a 25-yard field goal for the 24-21 lead with 1:07 left in regulation, kicked two overtime PAT’s before 2-point tries became mandated from the third overtime on. \nFor Auburn’s overtime running back Peyton Barber rushed for three touchdowns. Daniel Carlson, whose 41-yard field goal with four seconds left in regulation wrought overtime, kicked two overtime PAT’s before White’s 2-point pass to Melvin Ray achieved the 38-38 tie completing the third overtime. \nArkansas started fast, leading 14-0 by its third possession. \nJunior college transfer and Camden Fairview grad receiver Dominique Reed tally the game’s first touchdown on an 11-yard jet sweep at 11:33 of the first quarter, completing a 75-yard drive that included three Allen passes to tight end Hunter Henry for 52 yards. \nHenry wouldn’t catch another until the overtime. \nArkansas started its second scoring drive at 3:59 in the second quarter and finished it with Allen’s 23-yard touchdown pass to Sprinkle at 14:22 of the second quarter. \nThe Hogs appeared ripe to make it 21-0 until Allen threw his only pick, intercepted by Kris Frost at the Auburn four.
