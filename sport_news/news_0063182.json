The FSHS junior has worked to regain her confidence this season after Born broke out last track season and beat her in the 3,200 and 1,600 at state. \n“I told myself that it doesn’t matter if I get first. It didn’t matter my place,” Venters said. “I just want to go for a Rim Rock PR and just improve my time myself.” \nJunior Kiran Cordes (10th), freshman Sarah Walpole (13th), sophomore Alvena Walpole (18th) and freshman Julia Larkin (20th) also cracked the top 20, but SM North took the team title by 12 points.

SM North’s Belesti Akalu won the boys race with a time of 15:37.5. \n“He (Donley) wanted to go after some guys he raced earlier this year and hadn’t beaten,” FSHS coach Steve Heffernan said, “and that happened today with the exception of that young man (Akalu), who ran tremendous.” \nLHS girls 11th, boys 12th \nFreshmen Morgan Jones and Anna DeWitt have been steady at the No. 1 and 2 spots on the Lawrence High girls varsity squad, and they were again Saturday, when they pushed the Lions to an 11th-place finish. \nJones placed 26th with a time of 20:29.8 and has become more comfortable against the competition as the season has gone on. \n“I think it helps a lot because I get to know all of the other people who are on varsity, and who I need to stay with,” Jones said. “I have another three years of knowing these people I’m running against.” \nOn the boys side, senior Nathan Pederson was the top runner for LHS, clocking in at 17:44.9 for 53rd place. The Lions placed 12th in the team standings. \nThe Lions hope to find themselves back out at Rim Rock in two weeks for state as they prepare for their Class 6A regional meet at Haskell. \nFree State will head to Junction City to compete at Milford State Park. \nSunflower League Championships \nSaturday at Rim Rock Farm \nGIRLS \nVaristy \nTeam scores – Shawnee Mission North 51, Free State 63, Olathe East 78, SM Northwest 123, SM West 151, SM South 161, Olathe Northwest 181, Leavenworth 200, Olathe North 215, SM East 223, Lawrence High 300, Olathe South 351. \nFree State results – 2.
