It motivated them. After visiting McNair took the lead, the Yellowjackets quickly came back, taking control of the match and the San Joaquin Athletic Association race with a 4-1 win at Verner Field. The teams came into the match tied for first place in the SJAA. Franklin improved to 10-3-2 overall and 5-1-0 in the SJAA. The Yellowjackets own a one-game lead and hold the tiebreaker because they've defeated the Eagles (6-5-0, 4-2-0) both times they've played. “It was a very important match, and they have a very good team,” Franklin coach Richard Rodriguez said. “I like the way we responded when we had to.” Jorge Cardenas scored on a free kick to give the Eagles a 1-0 advantage in the 15th minute. Yellowjackets captain Miguel Acosta scored the first of his two goals on a cross from Andres Rayo a short time later to tie the match, and Benjamin Figueroa gave Franklin the lead for good. “Our coach told us that this is for first place, and we had to go out and represent the school,\" said Acosta, who also had an assist. Luis Rodriguez and Acosta pushed Franklin’s lead to 4-1 in the first 10 minutes of the second half, and the Eagles became frustrated. There was a confrontation with the officials which resulted in three McNair players being handed red cards. McNair coach Chris Hauschildt said there was no excuse for his players losing their cool, but did criticize the officials' performance and attitude. “Those refs were not very good. And (one of the officials) said that we are the most disrespectful team he’s ever reffed, which is not true,” Hauschildt said. “There were things that went on early that were let go. I don’t defend what (the red-card players) did at all. But those refs were disrespectful to our captain and players.” — By Scott Linesburgh, Record Staff Writer Edison 5, Stagg 1 At Edison, Saul Araiza had one goal and two assists and Gonzalo Andrade and Agustin Guerrero each had one goal and one assist for the Vikings (5-10-1, 4-2-0 SJAA).
