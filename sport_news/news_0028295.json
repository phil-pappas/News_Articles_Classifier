After a William Blount fumble in Rebels' territory, Maryville turned a short field into a 28-0 halftime advantage shortly before the half when Jordan Ervin reeled in a 14-yard touchdown reception from Hopkins.\nHopkins made it 35-0 on the Rebels' first drive of the second half with an 18-yard keeper up the middle and junior Jae Williams added the final score with a 6-yard run up the middle with just over two minutes to go.\n\"Dylan has played well,\" Quarles said. \"He is still kind of unsure of how to lead and be that out-front guy and we are okay with that.\n\"It is a lot to put on a sophomore to have to be the guy, but I think he has handled everything really well.\"\nMatthew Reagan is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:15:54.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
