ABC Hopes, which is the shortened version of All Because Christopher Hopes, is an organization that serves individuals like Christopher with Down syndrome.\nMoore, 31, said the plan is to open it up to other disabilities. The aim of the organization is to raise money to donate to other nonprofits and to demonstrate how capable individuals with Down syndrome are.\nShe and her dad came up with the idea of a program for adults because after 21, young adults like Christopher, 22, are aged out of school. Parents have to search around for other programs or young adults with disabilities end up sitting around the house all day, she said.\nMoore’s parents own citrus groves in Corona and her uncle a farm in Valley Center, near San Diego. Three days a week she takes Christopher and the other program participants to farmers markets in Corona and Anaheim to sell fresh produce from the groves and the farm.\nThey handle booth set-up and all of the sales themselves and are a hit with customers, Moore said. It’s a job, so they also get paid after each market, giving them a sense of independence to save and buy the things they want, she said.\n“People with disabilities want to contribute,” the Orange resident said. “The impact it has on everyday society is huge. It brightens people’s days.”\nWhen they’re not working the farmers markets, she takes Christopher with her to various speaking engagements and community events. Moore helped organize Corona’s host city event for the World Games Special Olympics this summer and recently participated with Christopher in the World Kindness Youth Conference in the city.\nThe Corona High School alumna, one of five children, said she was 9 years old when Christopher was born, and they’ve been close from day one.\n“He and I have always had a special bond,” she said.\nThey like to watch baseball together, catch movies, and go out to eat.\nMoore said her family has always treated Christopher like every other sibling.\n“There’s nothing different about him,” she said. “We’ve never treated him like he has a disability. We really focused on making sure he had good social skills.”\nCorona resident Becky Sherbanenko, who helps Moore with the organization, said the pair has a special relationship.\n“Her commitment to Christopher is her driving force,” Sherbanenko said. “She doesn’t treat him with kid gloves. That’s why he is so social. His family expects him to behave a certain way.”\nSherbanenko, whose daughter went to Corona High with Moore, said her first son had Down syndrome and died at six months old. So when she heard about Moore’s ABC Hopes, she wanted to get involved.\nShe said she has grown as a result of helping with ABC Hopes.\n“It’s been a growth experience for me,” Sherbanenko said. “It’s one of the highlights of my life.”\nContact the writer: melaniecj@yahoo.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxb4l-b88534812z.120151008154155000g1mcfq1c.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxb4l-b88534812z.120151008154155000g1mcfq1c.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:32:28.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
