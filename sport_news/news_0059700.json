Consultants. Tiny houses.\nThese are some of the topics raised during the Savannah mayoral forum that capped a day of similar forums for all of the City Council races Monday.\nRegarding the city’s hiring of consultants to study various projects and programs, Louis Wilson said as mayor he would be more than happy to use his real estate experience to help staff reduce the amount of outside assistance needed. Eddie DeLoach said he supported the use of consultants when their expertise is not something staff is trained for, but said the problem with the city was that they never did anything following the consultants recommendations.\n“You can not hire a consultant and put the information on a shelf,” he said. “You have to take the consultant’s information and do something.”\nMurray Silver criticized the city manager for spending taxpayer money an outside consultant to investigate the issues with the Savannah-Chatham police department, which he said she should have known on her own. Mayor Jackson took issue with both claims of DeLoach and Silver in a rebuttal, stating only one instance in which the city did not take the consultant’s recommendation and that consultant hired to investigate the police department was necessary.\n“It was because we wanted to be open and transparent and not do it within,” she said.\nA question regarding what they would do to address homelessness spurred the mayor to voice support for the Chatham Savannah Authority for the Homeless plan to build small houses somewhere in the community for them, while Silver said that rental subsidies should be available to veterans.\nWilson said he has been having issues with litter and mosquitoes generated on city-owned, wooded property near his house. He said he would not mind if the property was developed with tiny houses for them to live. DeLoach said that affordable housing needed to be put in place.\nThe privatization of government departments drew mixed support. Silver said privatization could be a cost cutting measure when it is done right, but that was a rare occurrence. Wilson and Jackson said they were also opposed, while DeLoach said he supported privatization in some areas that could help small businesses, but not for public safety.\nThe candidates were also asked how they would take advantage of the city’s high credit rating to improve public safety. In response, Wilson said he was not in favor of borrowing more money, but that existing funding needed to go towards developing businesses and employment opportunities in lower-income communities.\n“We don’t have a money problem,” he said. “We have a distribution problem and it’s causing crime.”\nDeLoach said he supports borrowing funds to purchase police vehicles and other equipment for officers, while Silver claimed the city would not have to borrow any money if they would take advantage of millions of dollars available through the Department of Justice for rebuilding struggling police departments.\n“All we have to do is ask,” he said.\nJackson said the city works closely with the justice department and that the city has saved $8 million in three years by taking advantage of lower rates and refinancing city bond debt. She said she also supported the use of bonds to continue funding projects in the area, such as the purchase of police vehicles.\nON THE WEB\nMissed any of Monday’s political forums?
