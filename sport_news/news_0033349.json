Steve Beshear and other top officials Monday morning.\nThe bridge under construction parallel to the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge is rapidly nearing completion and, based on most recent forecasts, should begin carrying Interstate 65 traffic by the end of the year. Speculation has focused on perhaps that schedule being moved up, at least slightly.\nBeshear is scheduled to make the announcement at 9:30 a.m. Monday, along with Indiana Lt. Gov. Sue Ellspermann, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and Mayor Mike Moore of Jeffersonville, Ind.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nS. Indiana sees I-65 traffic shift\nThe press conference is to be held on the new downtown bridge.\nThis schedule for the bridges project is the following:\nBy mid-October, the new bridge will be in its “final shape,” with all 88 stay cables in place. By late-October, the bridge deck will extend from bank to bank with all piers connected. By late fall, the deck of the bridge will be poured. By January, the bridge will open to two-way traffic for Interstate 65. (The bridge will eventually carry only northbound traffic.) When the new bridge opens to two-way traffic, crews with lead contractor Walsh Construction Co. will begin making $22 million in improvements to the adjacent John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge, which now carries all I-65 traffic.\nA new floor system will be built on top of existing floor beams, adding decades of new life to the 52-year-old bridge. The entire Downtown Crossing – the new cable-stayed bridge, the improved Kennedy Bridge and interstate connections on both sides of the river – will be complete by December 2016.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e92d4126e177a1f6d979fd05c145e0461647c412/c=888-0-4784-3896/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Louisville/Louisville/635792964989718717-EPA-6.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:05:36.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
