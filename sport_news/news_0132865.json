Mandatory Credit: Joe Maiorana-USA TODAY Sports ** Usable by SD ONLY ** (Joseph Maiorana / USA Today Sports) Perry Hills staked his claim to being Maryland's starting quarterback. \nPerry Hills has always played quarterback for Maryland with a chip on his shoulder. \nHe was the true freshman in 2012 who was thrust into the starting role because of injury before an injury of his own sent him tumbling back down the depth chart. He fought his way back into the starting job in August before being pulled in the second game of the season. \nSo when he took the field for the Terps against No. 1 Ohio State with a sea of scarlet, 107,869 strong, watching from the stands of the famed Ohio Stadium, it was no different. And in the 49-28 defeat — one that could have significant ramifications for the program — Hills turned in a gutsy performance to boost a stagnant offense. \n\"I always feel I have something to prove, but today I was really just focused on coming out and trying to have fun,\" Hills said. \"If you're not having fun, you're not doing the right things.\" \nHills declined to say when coach Randy Edsall named him Saturday's starter —\"You'll have to ask him,\" Hills said — but the Terps attacked the Buckeyes with a game plan that focused on Hills' legs. The Pittsburgh native rushed for a Maryland-quarterback record 170 yards on 25 carries and scored two touchdowns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:30:55.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
