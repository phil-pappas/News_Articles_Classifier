Some fans will need to brace themselves when we reach Class C.\nCLASS AA\nEMPIRE DIVISION: Saratoga (6-0, 4-0) is the No. 1 seed, regardless of its result against Ballston Spa (3-3, 2-2). Win or lose, the Scotties are locked into the No. 4 seed. Shenendehowa (3-3, 3-1) and Guilderland (5-1, 3-1) collide Friday for the No. 2 seed. The loser has the head-to-head tiebreaker against Ballston Spa should the Scotties upset Saratoga.\nLIBERTY DIVISION: Shaker (6-0, 4-0) has locked up the No. 1 seed and can do no worse than a tie for its fourth straight Liberty title if it falls to Colonie (1-5, 1-3). Columbia (4-2, 3-1), already into the playoffs, can secure the No. 2 seed at Bethlehem (3-3, 2-2). The Eagles can gain the No. 2 seed with a win over Columbia and a loss by La Salle (2-4, 2-2) against Schenectady (1-5, 0-4). Wins by Bethlehem and La Salle would create a three-way tie for second in the division at 3-2 — which would mean those three seeds would be determined by quarter points. It happened in 2014.\nCLASS A\nNORTHWEST DIVISION: Burnt Hills (6-0, 4-0) is the division champion for the first time since 2012. Queensbury (4-2, 3-1) is already in the playoffs and can lock up the No. 2 slot with a win against Green Tech (4-2, 2-2). South Glens Falls (3-3, 2-2) can knock out Gloversville (3-3, 1-3) with a win.\nSOUTHEAST DIVISION: Troy (6-0, 4-0) is the No. 1 seed and division champ. Amsterdam (3-3, 2-1) is the No. 2 seed — no matter what its result is Saturday against Bishop Maginn (0-6, 0-3) because the Rugged Rams own the head-to-head tiebreaker against the winner between Averill Park (2-4, 1-2) and Mohonasen (2-4, 1-2). The loser between Averill Park and Mohonasen lands the No. 4 seed.\nCLASS B\nWEST DIVISION: Schuylerville (6-0, 5-0) is the No. 1 seed and division champion after beating Glens Falls (5-1, 3-1) 33-0. The Indians face Hudson Falls (4-2, 3-1) to determine the No. 2 and 3 seeds. Broadalbin-Perth (1-5, 1-3) plays at Johnstown (2-3, 1-3) for the No. 4 seed.\nREINFURT DIVISION: Schalmont (6-0, 4-0), the state's No. 1 team, plays at Ravena (6-0, 4-0) for the division title and No. 1 seed. The loser is locked into the No. 2 seed and Lansingburgh (4-2, 4-2) is set at No. 3. Saturday, Hudson (2-4, 2-3) plays at Albany Academy (3-3, 2-3) in a winner-take-all game for the No. 4 seed.\nCLASS C\n(Top two finishers in each division automatically qualify, followed by the top two third-place teams as the No. 7 and 8 playoff seeds)\nNORTH DIVISION: Greenwich (6-0, 4-0) is the No. 1 seed regardless of its result Friday at Hoosick Falls (4-2, 2-2). Corinth (4-2, 4-1) has completed its division slate and is locked in at No. 2. The real drama revolves around the No. 3 finisher (and which team would get left out of the playoffs). Hoosic Valley (4-2, 2-2) beat Hoosick Falls 27-6 in Week 1 and has that tiebreaker over the Panthers if they are tied at either 3-2 or 2-3 in the division. Hoosick Falls, winners of six straight Section II Class C titles, needs to beat Greenwich and have Hoosic Valley lose Saturday against Granville (1-5, 1-3). If Hoosick Falls and Hoosic Valley both win, it would mean Hoosick Falls would be out of the playoffs for the first time since 2000 despite a 5-2 overall record.\nCENTRAL DIVISION: Mechanicville (4-2, 4-0) has secured the No. 1 seed, even if it falls to Watervliet (3-3, 2-2). Stillwater (4-2, 3-1) is the No. 2 seed. Watervliet, Voorheesville (2-4, 2-3) and Tamarac (2-3, 1-3) are all vying for the No. 3 position. Watervliet can lock out the other two with a win over Mechanicville. Voorheesville is done in the division and Tamarac must beat Stillwater to have any chance at a wild-card berth.\nSOUTH DIVISION: Fonda (5-0, 3-0) and Coxsackie-Athens (4-2, 3-0) are locked into the top two positions and meet Saturday to determine the order. Chatham (2-4, 2-2) is the No. 3 finisher and eligible for a wild-card berth.\nNote: Monday night, the Class C football coaches met to go over the playoff scenarios.\n\"They double-checked divisional quarter points, football points and went over the tiebreakers,\" Section II football coordinator Bob Dorrance said. \"Written into the tiebreaking procedures that (the Class C coaches) all voted on, the No. 7 and 8 wild-card seeds will come from the three third-place finishers.\"\nDorrance added that because of the North Division's strength this season, the Class C committee may seek to modify its playoff criteria prior to the start of the 2016 season.\nCLASS D\nWhitehall (6-0, 4-0) and Cambridge (6-0, 4-0) are both in the playoffs and meet Saturday in Cambridge to determine the No. 1 and 2 seeds for the Week 9 semifinals at Schuylerville. Canajoharie (4-2, 2-2) locks up the No. 3 spot with a win at Rensselaer (3-3, 1-3). If the Rams prevail, there is a strong chance Warrensburg (2-4, 1-3) could make it a three-way tie if the Burghers defeat Salem (0-5, 0-4).\njallen@timesunion.com • 518-454-5062 • @TUSidelines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:20:36.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
