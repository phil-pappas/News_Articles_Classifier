Worth suspended the school’s football team Tuesday for Friday’s game against Waterford High after a school investigation found members of the team engaged in inappropriate activity in a cell phone group chat. Plainfield will forfeit Friday's scheduled game against Waterford. “Because the situation originated with members of the football team and a couple of other kids, and because the activity is certainly a violation of our athletic code of conduct and our school code of conduct regarding social media, and in general good behavior, that is the reason I have now suspended the team from participating in the football game on Friday evening,” Worth said. The group chat occurred on the cell phone app “WhatsApp,” which uses cell phone data, but doesn’t charge for text messages. While Worth wouldn’t go into detail about what made the chat inappropriate, NBC Connecticut reported on its website Tuesday that Plainfield parents said the chat involved a team member exposing himself and nude photos of underage girls. Worth was notified of the situation after school Thursday and launched an investigation that included athletic director Jan Voland and other school administrators Friday morning. “Initially the discussion was appropriate and had to do with football, things like that,” Worth said. “It appears that the discussion evolved and became inappropriate.” Plainfield High officials notified the Plainfield Police Department when they started the investigation, but Worth indicated it was not a police matter. “I spoke directly with students individually, I spoke with students collectively,” Worth said. “I have spoken to the parents of the students that have been involved.” Worth said the school’s investigation has not concluded. “It has come to an end right now, but should any further information come forward we’ll continue to look into it,” he said. The Panthers are 3-2 this season. They were scheduled to play at Waterford, the only winless team in the Eastern Connecticut Conference in a Small Division matchup. “I think they were disappointed, but they understood why I went the route that I did as far as the consequences for the actions,” Worth said. “You win a game as a team, you lose a game as a team, you are responsible for the things that you do as a team.” By Brett Poirier The Bulletin The Bulletin By Brett Poirier The Bulletin Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 4:55 PM Updated at 5:37 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:42:11.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
