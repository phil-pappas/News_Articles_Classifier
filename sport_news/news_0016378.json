The pair will now meet in the final. \n\nMamishzada destroyed his opponent Mohamed Flissi, sending the Algerian crashing to the canvas twice in the first round, winning by a knockout. \n\nAnother Cuban Lazaro Alvarez won in the lightweight division (60kg), meaning the Caribbean boxing powerhouse nation has six fighters in the finals, which will take place on Wednesday and Thursday. \n\nBritain's last boxer at the championships though failed to make it through. \n\nSuper heavyweight (91+kg) Joseph Joyce was outpointed by France's Tony Yoka to bring the curtain down on Britain's efforts at the championships.
