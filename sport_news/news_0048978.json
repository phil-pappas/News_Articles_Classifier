Then, he corrected himself. “Actually, we’ve talked about playing John on defense for the last year,” Kirby said. The situation was never more appropriate than last week’s victory against Western Alamance, when the Eagles’ come-from-behind victory featured a remarkable number of game-changing moments. Some such moments during that second half featured Lamot — EasternAlamance’s quarterback and the reigning Times-News All-Region Offensive Player of the Year — roaming the field without the ball in his hands, an odd sight on its own. “I was ready for it,” Lamot said coolly after the game. “I practiced there, I’ve been practicing there the last couple weeks, just in case they needed me. (Friday) night they finally needed me, finally made a debut.” Calls for Lamot to play defense in addition to his offensive prowess intensified after last month’s victory against EdenMorehead. The Panthers’ quarterback, Will Dabbs, also plays linebacker. “Our defensive coaches are like, ‘John needs to play defense. John needs to play defense. Coach, John needs to play defense,’” Kirby said. “The Dabbs kid from Morehead didn’t help. … I’ve had to hear that for the last few weeks.” Coming into the season, Lamot’s experience on defense was one snap. In last season’s game at Western Alamance, he checked in at outside linebacker. The play was a run to the opposite side, and Lamot didn’t have much of an effect on the play. Fast-forward to last Friday night, when the Eagles needed a boost against Western Alamance’s high-powered offense. “I think (offensive coordinator Tony Aguilar) said, ‘Why don’t we put John on defense?’” Kirby said. Patrolling the secondary and displaying the range to make plays near the line of scrimmage, Lamot had a profound impact. In the fourth quarter, Lamot defended two deep passes intended for Darius Pinnix and made an open-field stop on Western Alamance quarterback Tre McCollum to force a fourth-down. Within the Eagles’ man-to-man defense, Lamot was directed to follow Pinnix — who had five catches for 114 yards in the first half. Pinnix got loose for a 63-yard catch in the third quarter, but was held to catches of 7 and minus-3 yards in the fourth quarter. “John has been working at free safety since camp. It’s not like he’s never been there,” Kirby said. But there was a mold that was broken when Lamot checked in. Page 2 of 2 - “In my tenure … I’ve never played a quarterback on defense. I don’t like doing that,” said Kirby, who’s in his 24th season as head coach. “I think he’s our quarterback, he’s our field general, I’m scared he’s going to get hurt, I’m scared bad things will happen.” The overlying difference between these cross-county rivals is that Western Alamance shows little hesitation in using players on both sides of the ball — McCollum and K.C. Okoronkwo are a couple who have stood out on both sides — while Eastern Alamance rarely has used a player on both sides of the ball recently. “I think putting him on defense was smart and they’re going to have to do that more down the road,” Western Alamance coach Jeff Snuffer said. “And that’s going to help Lamot too, because he’s good everywhere you put him.” By Conor O'Neill", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:55:54.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
