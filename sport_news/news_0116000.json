Completion could be desirable, no matter how out-of-true. Sounds too difficult to understand? Step inside Capitol Complex, look around for Le Corbusier's non-existent-yet-talked-about Governor's Palace. Move a little further, there's Geometric Hill, and there's Martyrs Memorial —both awaiting completion. Dare to deconstruct? \"I am frightened at the idea of anyone completing Corbusier's functional designs because forms cannot precede functions,\" said Micheal Richard, executive manager of the Foundation le Corbusier in Paris. \"You have a problem of public spaces. So, first identify the spaces. I wouldn't touch the Capitol Complex,\" he said on the third day of the four-day international symposium celebrating Corbusier's Chandigarh - 50 years after the master'. SD Sharma, who worked closely with Corbusier on the Capitol Project, said the then administrators had rejected his design of the Governor's Palace and asked him to make another which he did half-heartedly in the shape of Museum of knowledge. He said the original design, having the symbol of bull horns on top, has many connotations. \"Deciding on the incomplete structures is very crucial. Completing the project would fill the void in Capitol Complex,\" he said. On the consensus level, many experts felt that unlike the colonial cities such as Delhi and Mumbai where the creators were from two different cultures, Chndigarh's creators and custodians were the same. So, it is easy to decide which way to go: the Corbusier's or the more acceptable middle path. The speakers appeared torn between neo-liberalism of 'smart cities' and radical functional aesthetics, which defines the character and heritage of Chandigarh. Talking of the city's Master Plan 2031, Sumit Kaur, former UT chief architect, and Kapil Setia, UT chief architect, director of National Institute of Urban Affairs, said the there was a strong feeling that the city be recognised as world heritage by UNESCO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:12:28.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
