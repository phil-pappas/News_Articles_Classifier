On top of that, the longtime Southern Miss verbal commitment has spent the past six weeks watching the Golden Eagle offense churn out yards and points at a breakneck pace. Todd Monken’s squad ranks 15th in the nation in total offense, 13th in pass offense and 35th in points per game. Not only that, Southern Miss appears to be on track for a reversal of fortune in the win-loss column, as it is 3-3 overall and 1-1 in Conference USA at the mid-way point of the 2015 season. \nWhich has left McNair, the nephew of former NFL star Steve McNair, chomping at the bit to get back on the field and in a Golden Eagle uniform. \n“I can’t wait to join that offense,” he said. “The guys are all bought in to what coach Monken is doing. (Offensive coordinator Chip) Lindsey has the offense really rolling and my projection is we will get to a bowl game this year.” \nMcNair is but one of 13 confirmed verbal pledges toward the 2016 signing class. However, he’s not the only one of the bunch high on the way the first half of Southern Miss’ season has gone. \n“They are doing some awesome things,” said Jacob Johnson, a senior offensive lineman at Spanish Fort (Alabama). “I think they just had a slip-up against Marshall and played Nebraska really close, and I was impressed by that. I’ll be at the game (versus Texas-San Antonio on Oct. 17) to watch Southern (Miss) get that W.” \nDespite the early-season success and relatively large number of prospects committed at this point, Monken said the recruiting cycle hasn’t changed drastically compared to his first two seasons in Hattiesburg. The third-year head coach said the staff has been selective since he arrived. \n“I don’t know if it’s any different right now,” he said. “(We’ve declined to accept a commitment) once, maybe twice. Not that often. But that happened last year, too. Are we on a lot of different guys we’re excited about? Sure.” \nOne such recruit is Dutchdown (Louisiana) dual-threat quarterback Jared Sparks, who committed to Southern Miss in June. The feeling is mutual. \n“I feel like (Southern Miss) is doing an awesome job,” he said. “We’re getting closer and closer to where we want to be as a team. It’s very encouraging that the team gets better and better every year. That it’s progressing. It’s encouraging knowing I’m going to a team that’s on the rise instead of a downfall. \n“I’m excited to be a Southern Miss commit.” \nAnother quarterback committed to the Golden Eagles is Itawamba Community College’s Kwadra Griggs. \n“They are having a great season right now,” he said. “The determination and will to win (has been encouraging).” \nMcNair, who also holds offers from TCU, Missouri and Cal, among others, said he’s been pleased with the others currently committed to Southern Miss and has been lobbying for others to join him at in Hattiesburg. \n“Those are big-time guys that we have committed and they are loyal to the program,” he said. “A lot of them committed before all the winning.” Sturm to start for UTSA \nTexas-San Antonio head coach Larry Coker said Dalton Sturm would start at quarterback on Oct. 17 at Southern Miss. \n“Dalton, right now, will be our quarterback,” Coker told reporters on Oct. 13. “He looked good today. Threw the ball, practiced well.” \nSturm, who began the season as the team’s fourth-string quarterback, will likely start in place of Blake Bogenschutz, who is sidelined with a concussion. Coker did not rule Bogenschutz out for Oct. 17’s game, telling reporters he will be re-evaluated on Oct. 14. \n“I don’t anticipate him playing this week, but we’ll see,” Coker said. \nSturm tied a program record with four touchdown passes in a narrow loss to Louisiana Tech last week. \n“They have had a couple of quarterbacks quit, so they’re down to their fourth-team guy and he came out slow,” Monken said. “Right when they were probably thinking about pulling him, he leads them to three touchdown drives and gives them a chance to win. That’s a credit to their staff and that young man.” 14 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1RFSh3A TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:31:37.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
