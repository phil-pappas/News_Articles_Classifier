The Marshwood High School junior with the football player’s build carried his scull down to the banks of the Cochecho River. He followed it into the chilly water, climbed in and, with a few powerful strokes, glided up the river toward the Maine border to commence his daily training. On Sunday, Arenburg and 11 of his teenage teammates from Great Bay Rowing in Durham will take part in the world’s largest two-day regatta, the 51st annual Head of the Charles in Boston that will feature more than 9,000 competitors in 61 events, along with some 400,000 spectators. Most of the rowers have attended the spectacle in the past. To be a part of it on the water is the thrill of their young lifetimes. “It’s huge,” said Arenburg. “I’ve been there before, to the ‘Charles.’ A lot of friends of my mom and dad have rowed it, and I really wanted to be in it.” Arenburg qualified to row in the Men’s Youth Singles competition, through his performance in the regattas leading up to this weekend. By lottery, Great Bay Rowing also earned spots in the Women’s Youth Fours and Men’s Youth Fours categories. The girls’ shell, with Betsy Cole (Portsmouth) as the coxswain, who sits in the bow, steers and navigates, also features Becca Shay (Oyster River), Olivia Ozkurt (St. Thomas), twin sister Katie Cole (Portsmouth) and Emmeline Laurence (Portsmouth). The boys’ shell, with Caroline Wilson (Oyster River) as coxswain, features Matt Ryan (Exeter), Jag Guerrette (Oyster River), Drew Dickinson (Portsmouth) and Ian Covell (Oyster River). At Great Bay Rowing, these teens are the top performers who earned this honor. In Boston Sunday, they’ll be matched against top performers from a much bigger pool of rowers. “I feel like it’s kind of the mecca for racing,” said Laurence, a sophomore who lives in Greenland. “We’ve worked so hard this season. I’m really excited to put everything together. You get to race against these amazing teams.” Instead of racing head-to-head, shells will start at 15-second intervals and be scored on time. The 3-mile course on the Charles River is the same for everyone, starting at the Boston University Boathouse and finishing near Christian Herter Park. On the shores, it’s a big festival, celebrating and promoting all that’s great about the sport of rowing. “Rowing is such a unique sport, and going into an event where all these other people are doing the same thing you love, it’s amazing,” said Wilson, a junior at Oyster River. “Everyone is brought together by the sport. It’s just a really cool experience.” Great Bay’s rowers, who train five days a week, usually at Jackson’s Landing in Durham, have enjoyed some success locally. At the annual New Hampshire Championships Regatta earlier this month in Pembroke, which featured 40 clubs from New England and New York, the girls’ fours took seventh place out of 27 boats; the boys were 13th of 32. Instead of winning, a more realistic goal Sunday in Boston will be to finish among the top 50 percent in their class, thereby earning a ticket to next year’s Head of the Charles. “It’s cool because it puts everything into perspective,” said Betsy Cole, a senior from Rye. “You race against teams that are really good in local events but they’re nothing compared to the teams you’ll see from Florida and California, where it’s all they do.” “The biggest thing I’ve seen this year with this group is that they’ve become enormously competitive and, at the same time, enormously close,” said Charlie Weymss, who coaches the girls for Great Bay Rowing with Holland Chadwick. “It’s all the elements of rowing we can hope for.” The two types of rowing are sculling (where a rower grasps an oar with each hand) and sweeping (where a rower’s two hands are propelling one oar). It requires strength, endurance and a honed technique, and rowers sharing a shell strive to work as a unit. “I love the part every day where I can get out on the water and row with my friends,” said Guerrette, a junior at Oyster River. “It gives me sense of calmness. It lets me just connect with myself and my friends and my rowing, and not think about homework for 2½ hours.” “I haven’t found anything that I love more,” said Shay. “It’s brought me closer to people and I feel stronger.” Shay, an Oyster River freshman, is the youngest rower who’ll be in one of the shells. It’s her third “season’ with Great Bay Rowing; with a year split into two seasons, her teammates Sunday all have between five and eight seasons of experience. Kailey Sonricker is the other entrant from Great Bay Rowing. The Berwick Academy student will row in the Women’s Youth Singles category. The boys team is coached by Nathaniel Brown. Ryan and Covell serve as team captains, with Covell sitting in the “stroke seat” (stern of shell). Sunday’s Head of the Charles race will conclude the competitive season for Great Bay Rowing, with shorter days and colder temperatures upon us. But the memory should be one rowers can hold forever, or at least until the weather warms and the shells return to the water next spring. “I’m almost 60 and I’ve been rowing since I was 14,” said Weymss. “With the exception of one type of boat — a single scull — it’s a team sport. If one thing isn’t going well everybody has to look at themselves first and then each other and figure out why it’s not going well. “But when it is going well, it’s sublime.” By Mike Zhe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:59:31.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
