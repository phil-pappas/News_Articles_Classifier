(AP Photo/Gary Wiepert) \nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Adam Henrique scored twice and added an assist and the New Jersey Devils won their fourth straight with a 4-3 victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night. \nMike Cammalleri had a goal and two assists, and David Schlemko also scored for the Devils. New Jersey hasn’t lost since starting the season 0-3-1. \nTyler Ennis, Ryan O’Reilly and Jack Eichel scored for Buffalo. Rookie goaltender Linus Ullmark made his NHL debut for the Sabres (2-6-0). \nBuffalo lost Evander Kane to an apparent left leg injury midway through the third period. A high-profile addition last season, Kane needed to be helped off the ice and did not return. \nCammalleri’s goal tied it 2-2 8:57 into the second, and then Schlemko put New Jersey ahead with 49 seconds left in the period. \nAbout midway through the third, Ennis mishandled a puck at the Devils’ blue line and Henrique scored on a shorthanded breakaway with a backhand shot past Ullmark.
