That recommendation has the support of key city officials, though it remains subject to City Council approval.\nBut Astone has questioned the process since the committee’s recommendation was announced last week. He talked then about protesting but has since decided against it.\n“It’s clear now that the administration never had any intention of making a change and are prepared to do anything to keep the status quo, including violating their own ordinance,” Astone told the Journal via email.\nGilbert Montano, chief of staff to Mayor Richard Berry, called Astone’s remarks “unfortunate.”\n“We do not have a response to these unfortunate comments made by this out-of-state vendor, but look forward to the future success of our local Convention and Visitors Bureau as they continue to promote and market Albuquerque as a premier convention and tourist destination,” Montano said in a written statement.\nAstone’s complaint stems from how the final scores were calculated during the review process.\nHe argues that ACVB received undeserved bonus points that made the difference between the first- and second-place scores. The points— for local and small business preferences — apply only to contracts that cost $5 million or less, according to city code.\nThe convention contract has topped $5 million four of the last five years. But it has no set value since it’s based on lodger’s tax and hospitality fees paid by hotel guests and can fluctuate based on visitation. It was worth an estimated $5.3 million last fiscal year and averaged $5.4 million annually the last five years.\nRob Perry, the city’s chief administrative officer, said last week that since the contract’s value is unpredictable, the city’s procurement office made a “technical decision” to award the preference points to ACVB.\nThose additional 419 points lifted ACVB above Catalyst for the top score, 4,609 to 4,465, though Perry indicated last week that the final score isn’t always the sole determinant. Recommendations also take into account the “best interests of the city,” and a lower-scoring bidder can sometimes still get the nod, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:51:52.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
