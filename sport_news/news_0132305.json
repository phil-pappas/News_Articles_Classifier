(Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) (JULIE BENNETT) Comments \nAuburn receiver D'haquille Williams has been dismissed from the football team. \nAuburn coach Gus Malzahn made the announcement Monday night, but did not cite a specific reason for the senior's dismissal. \n\"When individuals fail to meet the expectations of our program, there has to be consequences,\" Malzahn said in a statement. \"I gave D'haquille the chance to prove himself. I am disappointed that it did not work out.\" \nA reason for the dismissal was not provided Monday night. \nWilliams had only 12 catches for 147 yards and one touchdown through the first five games of the season. He entered the season a top-round draft prospect, but now his future beyond Auburn is in doubt. \nThe senior had a history of off-the-field troubles before and after his arrival on the Plains in 2014. He was suspended for the Outback Bowl after violating unspecified team rules -- and after a photo of himself with a black eye was uncovered on Instagram. \nCoaches suspended him again in August for more \"discipline issues.\" He was allowed to return to practices six days later. \nWilliams was a breakout star in 2014. He caught 45 passes for 730 yards and five touchdowns despite missing three games, including two due to a knee injury. \nESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. rated Williams the nation's No. 1 draft-eligible receiver in the offseason . \n\"Duke is a guy that had an opportunity to be a first-round pick,\" receivers coach Dameyune Craig said in the spring. \"He chose to come back. He didn't come back to be a fourth receiver, to be fighting for a job, we understand that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:39:33.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
