Four of them came against the three best pitchers in baseball this season: Clayton Kershaw (two), Zack Greinke, and Arrieta. The other came off Lester, a three-time all-star who has twice finished among the top four in Cy Young Award voting. \nMurphy's latest heroics gave the Mets a 3-0 first-inning lead. Curtis Granderson opened the frame with a single before the slumping David Wright drove him in with a double. Murphy quickly fell behind Arrieta, no balls and two strikes, before watching a fastball miss for a ball. He then lofted a curveball down in the strike zone, tucking it just inside the right-field foul pole. \nWhen Murphy stepped to the plate in the third inning with Granderson on second base, the Cubs intentionally walked the postseason's hottest home run hitter. Granderson, who had stolen second, swiped third and scored on Yoenis Cespedes' infield single. The next 16 Mets batters were retired until Murphy - who else? - lined a two-out single in the eighth. \nFor Arrieta, the outing was the second straight in which he surrendered four earned runs, the same number he allowed over his previous 13 starts spanning 971/3 innings, including his dominant complete-game shutout in the wild card game. The 29-year-old righthander and Cy Young candidate lasted only five innings Sunday, his fewest since June 16. \nNoah Syndergaard, the Mets' starter, lasted only two-thirds of an inning longer than Arrieta but was dominant for all but one of his frames. The hard-throwing rookie righthander allowed only one run on three hits, the last a run-scoring double by Kris Bryant. \nSyndergaard recorded nine strikeouts, three against Kyle Schwarber, and walked only one. Granderson, his rightfielder, provided an assist by robbing Chris Coghlan of a home run with an impressive catch in the second inning. \nJon Niese, Addison Reed and Tyler Clippard bridged the gap to Jeurys Familia, the Mets' reliable workhorse closer, who converted his fourth save of the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:22:14.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
