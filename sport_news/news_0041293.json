Talk of cursed Cubs may be for the birds 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Chicago\nFor the Chicago Cubs and their ever-hopeful fans, this bash was a long time in the making.\nKyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo and Javier Baez homered and the young Cubs clinched a postseason series at Wrigley Field for the first time ever, beating the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 Tuesday to win the NL Division Series in four games.\nOnly once since they last brought home the World Series in 1908 had the Cubs won a playoff series and never before had they finished off the job at their century-plus-old ballpark.\nCloser Hector Rondon struck out Stephen Piscotty on a pitch in the dirt, and catcher Miguel Montero scooped the ball and made the tag to end it. That sent the Cubs streaming out of the dugout to start a wild celebration.\n\"They deserve it,\" Rizzo said in the middle of the party. \"Hopefully, this is just a taste of what's to come.\"\nUp-and-comers all season, first-year manager Joe Maddon 's bunch of wild-card Cubs had arrived.\nThe Cubs are headed to the NL Championship Series for the first time since 2003. They beat Atlanta in the NLDS that year, but then lost in seven games to the Marlins. Chicago dropped those final two at home.\nNo team was hotter down the stretch than Chicago, which finished third in the majors with 97 wins after five straight losing seasons.\nThe Cubs knocked out the two teams that finished ahead of them in the NL Central, beating Pittsburgh in the wild-card game and sending St. Louis home after it led the majors with 100 wins.\nThe banged-up Cardinals had reached the NLCS in the last four years.\nRizzo's solo drive to right off losing pitcher Kevin Siegrist in the sixth put Chicago back on top 5-4 after St. Louis scored two in the top half.\nThe late drives by Rizzo and Schwarber along with Baez's three-run homer off John Lackey in the second came after Chicago set a postseason record with six long balls in Monday's win.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/22/8787074/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/22/8787074/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:22:17.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
