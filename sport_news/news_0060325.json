(Jason Miller / Getty Images) Ira Winderman Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel So what does Dwyane Wade think of the Cavs and LeBron? Here's what \nESPN has released Dwyane Wade's interview with the network regarding the upcoming season, including Wade's comments on LeBron James and the targeted Cleveland Cavaliers, who the Miami Heat face in their first road game of the season, on Oct.. 30 at Quicken Loans Arena. \n\"Some things you don't have to talk about,‚Äù Wade said. \"LeBron knows we're coming for them. They're at the top of the Eastern Conference. Everybody's going for them. \n\"They're dealing with a lot of injuries. In this league, it's about who's the healthiest. It's not about who's the best all the time. But they're still Eastern Conference champs, everybody better respect them. As long as No. 23 is over there wearing that jersey and you've got the guys around them, you've got to respect them no matter who's on the basketball court.\" \nWinslow out \nFirst-round pick Justise Winslow was given Wednesday off by the Heat due to leg tightness, sitting out the preseason game against the Washington Wizards. \n\"It is not an injury,\" coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"He is just starting to get tight. Jay [Sabol, the team's trainer] just wanted to keep him out a couple of days and have him do conditioning and refresh his legs.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:24:23.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
