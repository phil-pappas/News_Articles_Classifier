There are maybe three really good teams, three more pretty good ones, five or so medicore squads and then a whole lot of bad teams aspiring to be mediocre.\n1. Patriots (5-0)\nPrevious rank: 1. Result: Won 34-27 at Colts. Next: Sun. vs. Jets.\nThey pulled away from the Colts after taking advantage of a botched fake punt attempt. Tom Brady is showing no signs of decline.\n2. Bengals (5-0)\nPrevious rank: 4. Result: Won 34-21 at Bills. Next: Bye.\nThey scored 17 points on the first three possessions after halftime to smoke the Bills. QB Andy Dalton continues to impress.\n3. Packers (6-0)\nPrevious rank: 2. Result: Won 27-20 vs. Chargers. Next: Bye.\nThey looked vulnerable at home for the second week in a row. Philip Rivers lit them up for 503 yards passing.\n4. Broncos (5-0)\nPrevious rank: 5. Result: Won 26-23 (OT) at Browns. Next: Bye.\nOnce again the defense carried them to victory. Everyone keeps waiting for it to stop working.\n5. Panthers (5-0)\nPrevious rank: 7. Result: Won 27-23 at Seahawks. Next: Sun. vs. Eagles.\nThe jury is out on the Seahawks so maybe that win won’t look as good later. Right now the Panthers are rolling behind Cam Newton.\n6. Jets (4-1)\nPrevious rank: 11. Result: Won 34-20 vs. Washington. Next: Sun. at Patriots.\nThe Jets are 4-1 for the first time since 2010.They look to be the only team capable of challenging the Pats in the AFC East.\n7. Falcons (5-1)\nPrevious rank: 3. Result: Lost 31-21 at Saints. Next: Sun. at Titans.\nThe two red-zone turnovers and the blocked punt are correctable mistakes. The lack of a pass rush is a major weakness.\n8. Steelers (4-2)\nPrevious rank: 12. Result: Won 25-13 vs. Cardinals. Next: Sun. at Chiefs.\nThey’ve managed to survive without QB Ben Roethlisberger, who could return on Sunday against the Chiefs. The showdown with the Bengals is in Week 8.\n9. Vikings (3-2)\nPrevious rank: 15. Result: Won 16-10 vs. Chiefs. Next: Sun. at Lions.\nThey overcame two interceptions by QB Teddy Bridgewater. He did convert a third-and-15 pass on the final field-goal drive.\n10. Colts (3-3)\nPrevious rank: 8. Result: Lost 34-27 vs. Patriots. Next: Sun. vs Saints.\nThat bungled fake punt overshadowed a good effort. QB Andrew Luck showed no rust in his return from a shoulder injury.\n11. Cardinals (4-2)\nPrevious rank: 6. Result: Lost 25-13 at Steelers. Next: Mon. vs. Cardinals.\nThey collapsed in the second half as third-string QB Landry Jones rallied the Steelers. That’s a bad loss.\n12. Eagles (3-3)\nPrevious rank: 16. Result: Won 27-7 vs. Giants. Next: Sun. at Panthers.\nThey dominated the Giants to take control in the NFC East. After playing the Panthers they won’t face another good team until Dec. 6 at the Pats.\n13. Rams (2-3)\nPrevious rank: 14. Result: Bye. Next: Sun. vs. Browns.\nThe schedule is more manageable after the bye. Rookie RB Todd Gurley has been an instant hit.\n14. Giants (3-3)\nPrevious rank: 9. Result: Lost 27-7 at Eagles. Next: Sun. vs Cowboys.\nWith a chance to take control of the division, they got manhandled. The offensive line couldn’t protect QB Eli Manning against the Eagles.\n15. Bills (3-3)\nPrevious rank: 10. Result: Lost 34-21 vs. Bengals. Next: Sun. vs. Jaguars in London.\nThe Bills are struggling with injuries. GM Doug Whaley says he’s in a bind to add reinforcements because not all free agents have valid passports to travel to London.\n16. Chargers (2-3)\nPrevious rank: 12. Result: Lost 27-20 at Packers. Next: Sun vs. Raiders.\nThat’s two tough losses in a row. After the defense collapsed against the Steelers, the offense couldn’t punch in a tying TD on fourth-and-goal at the three.\n17. Raiders (2-3)\nPrevious rank: 20. Result: Bye. Next: Sun. at Chargers.\nThey spent the bye week working on the ineffective running game. Safety Charles Woodson is 39-years old and playing with a bad shoulder but he has four interceptions.\n18. Washington (2-4)\nPrevious rank: 13. Result: Lost 34-20 at Jets. Next: Sun. vs. Buccaneers.\nIt was no contest against the Jets once New York stopped turning it over. QB Kirk Cousins threw two picks in each of the four losses.\n19. Browns (2-4)\nPrevious rank: 17. Result: Lost 26-23 (OT) vs. Broncos. Next: Sun. at Rams.\nHow did they lose at home when Peyton Manning threw three picks? Because QB Josh McCown tossed a pick six and had another INT when driving for the winning field goal in regulation.\n20. Texans (2-4)\nPrevious rank: 27. Result: Won 31-20 at Jaguars. Next: Sun. at Dolphins.\nThey aren’t the worst team in the AFC, at least. Brian Hoyer has taken hold of the starting QB job.\n21. Saints (2-4)\nPrevious rank: 28. Result: Won 31-21 vs. Falcons. Next: Sun. at Colts.\nThe defense played surprisingly well in slowing the Falcons. The Falcons helped them solve their problems protecting QB Drew Brees.\n22. Buccaneers (1-3)\nPrevious rank: 22. Result: Bye. Next: Sun. at Washington.\nThe next three games are at Washington, at the Falcons and at home against the Giants. They will be lucky to win one of those.\n23. Cowboys (2-3)\nPrevious rank: 23. Result: Bye. Next: Sun. at Giants.\nMatt Cassel takes over at QB for Brandon Weeden. Maybe he will help the offense but the defense has been a big disappointment.\n24. Dolphins (2-3)\nPrevious rank: 30. Result: Won 38-10 at Titans. Next: Sun. vs. Titans.\nInterim coach Dan Campbell’s first game went well. The defense appeared rejuvenated and the offense scored a TD in the first quarter for the first time this season.\n25. Seahawks (2-4)\nPrevious rank: 19. Result: Lost 27-23 vs. Panthers. Next: Thurs. at 49ers.\nThey blew a fourth-quarter lead for the fourth time this season. The Seahawks would be 1-5 if not for the botched call by refs against the Lions.\n26. 49ers (2-4)\nPrevious rank: 31. Result: Won 25-20 vs. 49ers. Next: Thurs. vs. Seahawks.\nThey won for the first time since Week 1. QB Colin Kaepernick had his best game in a while.\n27. Lions (1-5)\nPrevious rank: 32. Result: Won 37-34 (OT) vs. Bears. Next: Sun. vs. Vikings.\nQB Matt Stafford bounced back after last week’s benching to throw four TDs. Throwing deep balls to Calvin Johnson helped.\n28. Bears (2-4)\nPrevious rank: 21. Result: Lost 37-34 (OT) at Lions. Next: Bye.\nThey had their chances to earn a third straight victory with a fourth-quarter comeback. At least the offense clicked with the return of WR Alshon Jeffery.\n29. Chiefs (1-5)\nPrevious rank: 24. Result: Lost 16-10 at Vikings. Next: Sun. vs. Steelers.\nThey had 51 yards of offense and 50 yards in penalties in the first half against the Vikings. RB Charcandrick West was stopped on fourth-and-one at the seven and lost a fumble on the final drive.\n30. Ravens (1-5)\nPrevious rank: 26. Result: Lost 25-20 at 49ers. Next: Mon. at Cardinals.\nThey added to the worst start in franchise history with a sloppy effort. There were two dropped passes in the end zone, two drops on potential interceptions and two picks by QB Joe Flacco.\n31. Titans (1-4)\nPrevious rank: 25. Result: Lost 38-10 vs. Dolphins. Next: Sun. vs. Falcons.\nThis could be just the opponent the Falcons need to rejuvenate their pass rush. The Dolphins sacked Marcus Mariota six times.\n32. Jaguars (1-5)\nPrevious rank: 29. Result: Lost 31-20 vs. Jaguars. Next: Sun. vs. Bills.\nQB Blake Bortles threw his sixth pick six in 19 career starts as coach Gus Bradley dropped to 8-30. The franchise is in trouble.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:38:35.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
