But as Bette Midler spoke to the well-heeled crowd last Thursday at the annual God’s Love We Deliver gala in downtown Manhattan, she extended just such an offer. The charitable organization’s volunteers cook and deliver meals to New Yorkers who are too sick to feed themselves. Cracked Ms. Midler, “And don’t worry, there will be a volunteer present to show you how to use a peeler.”\nThe evening celebrated the charity’s 30th anniversary and honored two supporters: ad man and chair of the board of trustees Michael Sennott and actor Neil Patrick Harris.\nENLARGE A variety of roses and parrot tulips decorated each table.
