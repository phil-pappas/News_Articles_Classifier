By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nLASALLE – The season as a whole didn’t turn out the way the Morris football team wanted. Watching the playoffs from the outside is not something that the Redskins are accustomed to. Related Links Strong Morris opening can’t overcome Kaneland \nAlthough the playoffs were not a possibility on Friday night, Morris still went out on a positive note, dominating LaSalle-Peru on both sides of the ball en route to a 40-0 victory. \nThere was plenty of praise to go around. The offensive line cleared the way for the running game to overpower the Cavaliers defense. Keagan Sobol led the multi-pronged rushing attack with 103 yards and two touchdowns on only nine carries. \nMichael Gerischer ran 12 times for 83 yards and a touchdown, Michael Feeney picked up 26 yards on nine carries, while quarterback Ricky Del Favero started for the first time and ran four times for 26 yards and scored a touchdown. Tommy Balentine ran four times for 29 yards and Will Ringer got three carries for nine yards. \nDel Favero didn’t throw often, but when he did, he was productive. The junior completed two of his three passes for 58 yards and two touchdowns. He hit Delaney Stutzki for a 40-yard touchdown in the first quarter and, in the second, connected with Jake Webb for an 18-yard score. \nThe offensive line was missing injured starter Brennan Goff, but fellow sophomore Nathan Korte stepped in for him at right tackle and performed admirably. \nAll season long, one of the quiet leaders on the offensive front was senior Michael Galifos, a two-year starter who says he’ll miss his teammates in maroon and white. \n“What I will remember most from playing football is doing whatever you can for the guys next to you,” he said. “It’s pretty cool that we won the last game of our high school career. We’re a pretty close unit, like a family. \n“I know that we are all going to stay friends after this, and we will probably all grow up and have kids that play in the program together, too.” \nWhile the offense had its way when it had the ball, the defense couldn’t have done much better. \nLaSalle-Peru picked up a first down because of a Morris penalty on its first drive, but then didn’t get another first down until the fourth quarter – by which time Morris already owned a 40-0 lead. \nAustin Dearing, who was in the starting lineup because of an injury to starting safety Michael Cryder, set the tone with an interception on the play after the initial L-P first down. Morris’ defense was dominant from then on. \nMorris picked up four sacks on the night: two by Ryan Niewinski and one each by Sobol and Kyle Overton. L-P finished with only 76 total yards, and 75 of them came on one play in the fourth quarter. \n“Our defense has been very good all year,” Morris coach Alan Thorson said. “In most of our losses, our defense still was very good. We struggled with our offense and that put the defense in bad spots quite a bit. We didn’t do that tonight and our defense showed what it can do.” \nRinger was a mainstay in the middle of the defense as a linebacker all season, and he said there was no way the Redskins were just going to go through the motions in this game. \n“Guys on this team never take days off,” he said. “This program means too much to us to do something like that. When it’s all done and we look back, what we remember won’t be won-loss record. It will be the guys we played with. I have been playing with a lot of these guys since we were like five years old. \n“Playing with them and in this program has helped make me a better person. That’s what I will remember.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:01:50.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
