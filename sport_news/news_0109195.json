The Jays’ Election Day 11-8 win over the Royals was bittersweet — after enjoying a 10-4 lead in the fifth inning, the Royals scored four runs in the ninth, closing the gap and nearly coming back.\nAfter Monday night’s victory, Jays fans hope the team can get some momentum in Game 4.\n“I'm not worried about the #Jays when the bats are back at home,” said Gregg Zaun, a Rogers Sportsnet baseball commentator and former Blue Jays catcher.\nJays manager John Gibbons is starting R.A. Dickey and Chris Young, but says he could use closer Robert Osuna or fellow reliever Aaron Sanchez.\nOsuna has a slight problem with a cracked nail and Sanchez has a blister on his finger. Gibbons said the two are okay to pitch, but he would rest them if he could.\n“We're concerned about it,” he said. “You don't want to get careless. But I mean they're not labouring enough or it's that painful. Guys get those throughout a year. You might give them a couple of days. Right now you really can't do that.”\nThe Blue Jays should get a boost of home game spirit from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra , which is scheduled to play the national anthem before Tuesday’s 4:07 p.m. game at Rogers Centre.\nWith files from The Canadian Press\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays-Royals ALCS Game 4 tip sheet\nWhat they’re saying in Kansas City: ‘No precedent for Cueto’s stink’ in loss to Jays", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1576267&ThemeId=16875"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:13:24.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
