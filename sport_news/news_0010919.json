Marquette, led by highly touted freshman Henry Ellenson, was picked sixth. DePaul is eighth and Creighton ninth.\nThe Red Storm, under new coach Chris Mullin, are a complete question mark, with an almost completely overhauled roster of talented freshmen and transfers. The Johnnies reached the NCAA Tournament a year ago, but graduated seniors D’Angelo Harrison, Phil Greene IV, Sir’Dominic Pointer and Jamal Branch, while Chris Obekpa transferred to UNLV and Rysheed Jordan, because of eligibility concerns, opted to turn pro.\nThe Pirates have high hopes despite the defections of guards Jaren Sina and Sterling Gibbs after getting off to a such solid start last year then finishing poorly. The hope is Whitehead, a McDonald’s All-American who never regained his form after a stress fracture last December cost him five weeks of his freshman season, can transition to the point guard spot, and fellow sophomores Delgado, Khadeen Carrington and Desi Rodriguez can take the next step in their development.\nVillanova guard Jalen Brunson was named Freshman of the Year and Providence junior Kris Dunn was selected as Player of the Year.\nButler duo Kellen Dunham and Roosevelt Jones made the first team, along with Villanova guard Ryan Arcidiacono, Xavier forward Jalen Reynolds and Georgetown guard D’Vauntes Smith-Rivera.\nThe second team consisted of Whitehead, Delgado, Ellenson, Villanova forward Daniel Ochefu and DePaul guard Billy Garrett Jr.\nBrunson, Xavier guard Trevon Bluiett, Georgetown forward Isaac Copeland and Marquette forward Luke Fischer were honorable mention.\n  Filed under chris mullin ,  isaiah whitehead ,  seton hall pirates ,  st. john's red storm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:05:07.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
