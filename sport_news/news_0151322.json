I wanted …\"\n\"A casket with a Cubs' logo on it?\" I asked.\n\"Yeah,\" he said with a laugh. \"Actually I wanted to experience more things, and life is richer than just your professional experience. And as I got closer to what would end up being 10 years in Boston, I realized this wasn't good for me or the organization, to stay in one place forever.\n\"I said it at the time, I think this starts to become a powerful inertia at play. It's hard if you're there for 10 years.\"\n'A real long shot'\nThe idea was never to become president of the Cubs, of course. When he began applying for summer baseball jobs while attending Yale University, Epstein just wanted to be part of a baseball operation.\nOrioles President and CEO Larry Lucchino gave him a shot with a summer job in 1992, and brought him back the next two summers. When Lucchino left to take on the same role with the Padres in '95, he hired Epstein, who also was attending law school at the University of San Diego, in the media relations department.\nCubs head of scouting Jason McLeod, whom Epstein calls his \"adopted brother,\" was a low-level staffer in the Padres' stadium operations department when the two met in '95. Padres GM Kevin Towers let them sit in on meetings, and the two 20-somethings watched and learned.\n\"We were very fortunate Kevin allowed us an opportunity to be involved in all those meetings,\" McLeod said. \"We used to sit around and talk about front offices and how we'd try to run things. He'd say, 'If I was a general manager, I'd do this,' and I'd say 'If I was scouting director, I'd think more along these lines.' There was a lot of dialogue like that.\"\nEpstein soon was promoted to a role as a baseball operations assistant under Towers. McLeod joined the department as well, starting a lifelong friendship that would result in Epstein bringing him to Boston, and then the Cubs, to serve as his right-hand man in scouting and development.\nEven when Epstein became the Padres' director of baseball operations, he still couldn't envision running his own team. Former players typically filled general manager jobs, not Ivy League punks.\n\"It wasn't on the radar,\" Epstein said. \"Even working in baseball operations seemed like a real long shot. But I had some people who believed in me, and whom I'm real grateful to, and had some great mentorship.\n\"It was lot of good timing and lucky breaks, and was able to work my way into a position where I could be part of a group that helped make decisions in San Diego, really my formative years in baseball.\"\nWhen Lucchino went to Boston as part of the Red Sox ownership group, he hired Epstein as an assistant GM in March 2002.\nEpstein had grown up reading the \"Bill James Baseball Abstract,\" which put baseball statistics in a new light. Epstein already had an analytical bent when he got to Boston, and decided to use that way of thinking to find a better way of evaluating players.\n\"I never thought I'd do it differently than anyone else,\" he said.\nTowers, Ted Simmons, Brad Sloan and other Padres executives with scouting backgrounds showed Epstein the importance of scouting, while James' books gave him the impetus to combine both methodologies.\n\"By learning about scouting from those guys and trying to think about the game from an analytical perspective as well, my conclusion was that the answer lied somewhere in the middle, that the best decisions we could make maybe made more sense from both standpoints,\" he said.\n\"It was a metaphor there because my desk in San Diego was between the scouting director and the statistical analyst, physically, as well as figuratively. That's how my way of looking at the game evolved.\"\nIn Boston, Epstein befriended young intern Jed Hoyer, his other \"adopted brother\" who was hired a week or so before him. The two shared the same interests, and were running buddies at night.\n\"We were two kids who just grew up obsessed with baseball and we hit it off right away,\" Hoyer said. \"One of the things about Theo, he's certainly able to talk about a lot of things in life, but he's also just a guy who loves the game, loves talking about baseball, loves working on it.\n\"That's the attitude and intensity you need in these jobs, because it's 100 percent baseball all the time. He really lives and breathes it.\"\n'Something to offer'\nAfter A's GM Billy Beane accepted and then changed his mind about taking the Red Sox general manager's job, Epstein was given an opportunity to live out his dream, becoming the youngest GM in baseball in 2002 at 28.\nHe was excited about the decision-making part, but not sure he could handle the other responsibilities that go along with it.\n\"I certainly wasn't the most experienced or the most deserving,\" he said. \"But I had put in some good time in the game and I felt like I had something to offer.\n\"I had spent a season in the organization already, so I knew who was good, who I could trust, who I can lean on. I felt like I knew exactly what direction we needed to go as an organization.\n\"There were still a lot of obvious competitive advantages out there on the baseball landscape in 2002. It was a little easier landscape to navigate through back then than it is now that we have so much information out there. I felt excited about the baseball side (but) had some anxiety about what it would mean for me personally.\n\"I was 28. I was pretty emotionally immature and it represented a sudden change of lifestyle I wasn't sure I was ready for. Going from complete anonymity, and being a pretty young 28, and then all of sudden managing people?\n\"I had never managed people much. It was a big change. I certainly relished my anonymity. In Boston, you're such a public figure if you're GM of the Red Sox. It was a big change. I was worried about how I would handle it emotionally. But that's not an opportunity you think twice about accepting, and then you just move forward.\n\"I made plenty of mistakes, but I adjusted. I had to grow up quickly.\"\nDuring that first winter, Epstein made some relatively small but significant moves, signing David Ortiz, Kevin Millar and Bill Mueller, adding offense and personality to the '03 team.\nThe Red Sox ultimately lost to the Yankees on Aaron Boone's walk-off home run in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series. After that loss, Epstein fired manager Grady Little and replaced him with Terry Francona.\nOver the winter he brought in stars like Curt Schilling and Keith Foulke and then watched the team jell together.\nThe players called themselves \"The Idiots,\" and they ended the team's notorious 86-year championship drought with a sweep of the Cardinals in the 2004 World Series.\nSuddenly, Epstein was king for life.\nBut the Red Sox success bred animosity between Epstein and his mentor, Lucchino.\nEpstein briefly quit his job after the 2005 season when he famously donned a gorilla suit to make an escape from the media camped out at Fenway Park. He returned after a short hiatus and when the Red Sox won their second championship in 2007, Epstein was so popular in Boston the idea of him leaving was heresy.\nIn early September 2011, Epstein blew off rumors of leaving for the Cubs, where GM Jim Hendry had been fired. Then the Red Sox pulled off an epic collapse to blow a postseason spot, and the Cubs came calling.\nEpstein came to Chicago to talk contract with Chairman Tom Ricketts the day he was spotted at the Starbucks. Instead of becoming the Cubs' GM however, he was offered the title of president of baseball operations, reporting only to Ricketts.\nDespite the additional power and money, Epstein wasn't completely sold at first.\n\"I had mixed feelings,\" he admitted. \"People I relied upon for advice sort of had mixed feelings about it, too. It was hard to leave. The biggest factor was my family.\"\nEpstein met his wife, Marie Whitney, in 2002 when she was a graduate student at Harvard and volunteering for work with the homeless. The two traveled to South America together in '05 during his brief hiatus from the Red Sox, and got married in 2007.\nEpstein came from a prominent, tight-knit family. Theo's grandfather, Phillip Epstein, and great-uncle, Julius Epstein, had won Oscars for writing the screenplay to \"Casablanca.\" Theo's father, Leslie Epstein, a novelist and director of the creative writing program at Boston University, inherited one of the Oscars and once put it on his mantle next to the 2004 World Series trophy.\nMarie knew how much her husband wanted to take on the challenge in Chicago and agreed it was the best decision, even if it meant the grandparents would be separated from 4-year-old Jack, the first of the their two sons.\n\"That was the biggest hurdle for us to overcome in leaving,\" Epstein said. \"But ultimately my family realized I'd be happier taking on a new challenge even though it was tougher geographically. I really appreciated that, especially my wife.\"\nPlan takes time\nOnce the decision was made and he came to Chicago, Epstein quickly laid out his game plan to build from the bottom up and asked Cubs fans for patience. That was easier said than done, especially when the Cubs lost 101 games in 2012 and 96 in '13. One newspaper had photo-shopped a picture of Epstein to make him look like he was walking on water when he arrived, but now the \"genius\" label was being used as a pejorative.\nSome fans wondered whether Epstein was just a media creation who finally had met his match with the luckless Cubs. Epstein said he dealt with the criticism by listening to NPR instead of sports talk radio.\n\"I know there was some loud protest about the path we chose,\" Epstein said. \"But I'd say the vast majority of fans were really supportive, were willing to wait a little bit longer to do it the right way, and embraced the young players and gave me all the support I could ever ask for.\n\"They gave the organization their support, patience, and continued to spend their money on the team. And they continued to say nice things when we'd pass them in the street.\"\nEpstein fired manager Dale Sveum after the 96-loss season in '13, essentially for his \"tough love\" approach to struggling young players Starlin Castro and Anthony Rizzo, two of the Cubs upcoming core.\nRick Renteria was brought in without any major league managing experience and was dubbed \"Ricky Sunshine\" for his endless cliches about \"chipping away.\"\nUnder Renteria, the Cubs started to show signs of life in the second half of 2014, while top prospects Kris Bryant, Addison Russell, Kyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler were proving they were close to being ready.\nBut when the Rays' Joe Maddon became available after the season, the Cubs bounced Renteria and hired the more proven and charismatic manager to replace him.\nWhy did it take so many managers to get the right one?\n\"It was a process,\" Epstein said. \"I was talking with Dale about this (last week). I told him we wouldn't be where we are as an organization without his contributions, and I firmly believe that. He brought toughness and edge and some great people with him, and he helped keep us on track through some really difficult times. Not a lot of talent to work with at the time.\n\"With Ricky, he helped create an environment that helped Castro and Rizzo to bounce back in 2014. And then Joe becoming available was a unique opportunity that we just really had to jump on.\n\"That was a really tough decision, and tough on me personally. As I said in the statement at the time, we really had a moral dilemma. We have to choose between being loyal to Ricky, who had done a good job, and being loyal to the organization, because Joe was so obviously the right person … for where we were headed next, and he has proven it. All my experience was telling me we had to do it. It was also unfair to Ricky, but we did it.\"\nRenteria has not responded publicly to the firing.\nEpstein said they tried to \"handle it as professionally\" as they could.\n\"There are casualties along the way,\" he said. \"It has been a wonderful journey to get where we are. It has not always been the easiest journey either. I think of Dale and I think of Ricky when we're pouring champagne, like we were (last Saturday). Both guys played a big part in getting us where we are.\"\nThings moving fast\nMaddon brought giant speakers to the practice fields in Mesa, Ariz., and blasted music during monotonous spring training drills, the first sign things would be different.\nBryant and Russell arrived in early April of this year, and the Cubs were a pleasant surprise with a winning record at the All-Star break. Then everything moved to warp-speed. The Cubs got on a roll in August, clinched their first postseason spot since 2008 last week and likely will wind up with the third-best record in the majors.\nThe memorable regular season ends Sunday in Milwaukee, before the next chapter begins Wednesday in the wild-card game.\nWhether the wild ride ends next week or not, the Cubs have made it clear they're here to stay. But for now, they have to learn to deal with the pressure of October baseball, knowing well that many Cubs teams in the past have folded in the postseason spotlight.\nEpstein's five-year contract with the Cubs ends after next season. Ricketts said last week they will talk about an extension soon, probably after the season.\nEpstein says he's in no hurry, knowing he plans to stay a while.\n\"I don't see myself leaving here until we win a World Series, at least,\" he said.\nBut what if the Cubs actually do win a World Series?\nWhat else left would Epstein have to accomplish?\n\"Maybe that would be the appropriate time to take a step back and reflect,\" he said. \"Seriously, there's not a lot of time for that now. This has been a full steam ahead building process with this organization, with so many different people contributing in so many wonderful ways.\n\"Now we've gotten to our first October and we're full speed ahead trying to win a World Series. Boston was a dash for a decade to try to win as much as we could. There will be a moment, hopefully after a couple of World Series, where we'll sit back and reflect and figure out what's next in life.\n\"But right now I couldn't be happier. I get to work with people I believe in, people I respect, people I have fun with, and we all share the same vision for the organization. And now we've finally gotten to make our fans happy, at least for the moment.\n\"That's a great feeling.\"\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Cubs", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560e99f0/turbine/ct-theo-epstein-cubs-playoffs-sullivan-spt-1004-20151003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560e92cb/turbine/ct-cubs-moments-2015-season-photos-20151002-005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d67b1/turbine/ct-cubs-moments-2015-season-photos-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560e92cc/turbine/ct-cubs-moments-2015-season-photos-20151002-006"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:01:54.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
