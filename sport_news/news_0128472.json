Related Links Coal City football starts fast, finishes off Sandwich \nJoe Starkey's 17-yard touchdown run with 2:17 left in the second quarter drew the Coalers within 7-6 when the extra point missed. It appeared then that the teams – who had played three straight games decided by one point prior to Friday – were headed for another close game. \nThat appearance changed in a hurry. Manteno's Gavin Zimbelman completed passes of 30 and 48 yards before hitting Brian Steele for an 11-yard touchdown during the Panthers' final drive of the first half. Zimbeklman was just getting warmed up, as he had three more touchdowns in the second half. From that final first-half drive on, Zimbelman went 22-for-30 for 271 yards. At one point, he completed 14 consecutive passes. \nCoal City's second-half drives resulted in two three-and-outs, a turnover on downs, an interception and a lost fumble as it possessed the ball for under eight minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:19:46.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
