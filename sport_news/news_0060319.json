It should come as no surprise Jackson aimed to build his 2015-16 Knicks on defense. Coach Derek Fisher said despite Jackson’s 11 coaching rings and his reputation as a defensive-specialist power forward, he’s somehow become underrated as a figure who associates himself with defense. As preseason has worn on, he has been increasingly spotted alongside the court during practices, occasionally making defensive comments aloud.\n“Phil obviously, with the coaching success he’s had, defense was always at the forefront of those teams,’’ Fisher said. “He had great offensive players but the defenses were really good. I don’t think when he took the job we were trying to outscore people.\n“Last year’s roster was already in place. The level of injury and transition we had a year ago, it was tough to be consistent in anything. I think we got back to what we’ve always believed — that defense is what wins championships, in just about any sport. That’s why we prioritize certain guys in the offseason.’’\nIndeed, Knicks management has given off an air it wasn’t bothered by the snub of center Greg Monroe because its own signee, Robin Lopez, is considered a better defensive pivot.\nDefense was the biggest factor in prioritizing shooting guard Arron Afflalo after being priced out of defensive wings Wesley Matthews and DeMarre Carroll.\nThe Knicks were dead last in 3-point field-goal defense last season.\n“I think we’re going to get better but that’s just semantics,’’ Fisher said. “If you don’t go out and get the job done, it doesn’t really matter if you have the guys who statistically looks like they can play good defense. We have to prove it. We have large number of guys who have that type of mindset.’’\nRookie Kristaps Porzingis never had picked up a baseball before throwing out the first pitch at a Mets game June 28 after the draft. He thinks it worked.\n“Now that they’re doing well because of my pitch obviously I’m following them a little,’’ Porzingis said. “Hopefully they can win it all. It was a good pitch.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:21:12.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
