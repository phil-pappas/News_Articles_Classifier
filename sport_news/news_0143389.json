First-half goals from Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons gave the Scottish champions a two goal lead after 32 minutes until a bad mistake by the Nigeria defender two minutes from the break allowed substitute Fernandao to pull a goal back. The Brazilian striker, on in the 40th minute for the injured Volkan Sen, headed in his second three minutes after the restart from a corner after he had escaped the attention of Ambrose and in the end the Parkhead side had to settle for a point. The Norwegian said after the game: “When you are defending you need to keep concentration for 90 minutes and that is the biggest challenge Efe has. “He plays 88 minutes very good but he sometimes makes some easy mistakes and today was one of them. “As a defender you have to keep concentration for 90 minutes. “I think we played well in the first half, we got 2-0 up and it was important to keep that lead into the break. Meanwhile Celtic fans on twitter also laid into the Nierian defender who has been called up to replace the injured Kenneth Omeruo for next weekend’s international friendlies against Congo and Cameroon in Belgium.

Can’t fault the rest of the team though. Tierney and Forrest were top class,” Ronnie Charters wrote:”If Efe Ambrose is #Celtic quality then they are far worse than I imagined. Ronny Deila cannot be excused for persisting with that man.” Conor Rafferty wrote: “I feel like I’m going insane when I keep asking myself the same question. Why is Efe Ambrose still at Celtic? He’s a liability.” Scottish Sun also tweeted:| Should Efe Ambrose play again for Celtic in Europe after another costly mistake?
