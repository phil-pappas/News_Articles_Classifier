Be in the right places. Be there to win your battles. ... The two of us want to get to the level we were playing at last year.\"\nThe Hawks kicked off their lengthy stretch of games without Keith with the triumph at the United Center thanks to goals from Artem Anisimov, Brent Seabrook and Patrick Kane.\nIf that Hawks are going to keep afloat while Keith is out, they will need more from Toews and Hossa, who have gone through left wingers so far this season about as often as they sharpen their skates. On Thursday night, Hossa had two shots on goal, Toews four.\nAgainst the Panthers, Toews and Hossa skated alongside Viktor Tikhonov on the left wing. The three had shown stretches of quality play last week in a loss to the Flyers, but coach Joel Quenneville quickly disbanded the trio after a slow start in a loss to the Capitals. Quenneville has tried Bryan Bickell, who was a healthy scratch Thursday, Teuvo Teravainen, Andrew Shaw and Ryan Garbutt at various times on that line. For Tikhonov, who is in his first season on the team, playing with Toews and Hossa represented a great opportunity to establish himself.\n\"The first game I was just trying hard not to let myself get overwhelmed,\" Tikhonov said. \"I think any hockey player in our generation right now would say the dream of playing with those two guys. Obviously that thought was in my head but you have to push it aside and do your job.\"\nThe line had some quickness and determination early and helped the Hawks grab a 12-4 advantage in shots on goal after the first period.\nIt was a refreshing period for Toews and Hossa, who have seen their possession numbers dip this season. According to war-on-ice.com, Toews' Corsi For percentage, which measures the percentage of shots a team takes when a player is on the ice, was 46.6 percent entering Thursday. Since 2009, that number had not been below 55 percent for Toews in a season. Similarly, Hossa's was at 50.6 percent, his lowest number since 2008.\n\"Once we settle in, shake off that rust a little bit, we'll be able to settle down,\" Toews said. \"It won't matter as much who's playing with us. But we'd like to play well enough to have some consistency, and stick with the same left winger for a little while.\"\nHossa said it has taken a while for the new players in the Hawks' lineup to learn their system. He estimated it might take as many as 15 games for the new players to get up to speed. With Keith out, however, the learning curve is diminishing quickly.\n\"Right now we're searching,\" Hossa said. \"Our coaching staff is searching who is the best with whom and I'm sure we'll find a way soon.\"\nBut their effort was good enough on Thursday.\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742077&h=Blackhawks%27+Toews%2C+Hossa+keep+plugging+away+in+3%2D2+victory+over+Panthers", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742077&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742077"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:17:40.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
