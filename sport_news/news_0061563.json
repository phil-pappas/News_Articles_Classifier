Orlando City didn’t matter. The doomsday scenario of slipping out of the playoffs didn’t matter. Everything hinged on the Revolution rising to the occasion against New York City FC and taking care of business themselves.\nThere were no doubts left about their ability to do so after a 3-1 victory Sunday. Lee Nguyen scored inside the first two minutes to establish the tone. Charlie Davies and Kelyn Rowe extended the lead before the hour, while David Villa’s late penalty kick did not prevent the Revs from securing their playoff place on the final day of the regular season.\nThis comprehensive performance arranged a one-off playoff at D.C. United on Wednesday in the Knockout Round. It also served as exactly the sort of foundation the Revs wanted to forge as they plotted their postseason push.\n“I think it’s more than the result,” Rowe said. “I had faith in us not dropping too many goals here in New York. But I think, for us going forward, we didn’t have the best end of the season. The last four games weren’t our favorite, but, going forward, we came together as a team tonight. And, going forward, I think we’ll be that way on Wednesday.”\nAny notions of a massive collapse — including an Orlando win, a Revs loss and an eight-goal swing on goal difference — faded from the moment Nguyen slotted home in the opening two minutes. His deft work to collect from Davies’ neat hold-up play and punish NYCFC for its shoddy defending provided his team with a necessary foothold.\n“The key tonight was making sure we were the first one to score,” Revolution coach Jay Heaps said. “We could put them in a position where we could be tight shape-wise and look to get opportunities against them.”", "external_links": ["http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url=", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Revolution+lock+up+playoff+spot"], "published": "2015-10-26T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:11:13.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
