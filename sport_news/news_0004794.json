Milan had gotten used to winning the battle in the trenches and running the ball with impunity on teams, but Scotland County turned the tables and plowed its way to a 21-0 victory on Friday night. Going into the game, Scotland County coach Mikel Gragg preached one message to his team. “We came in, and this is a spot we haven’t been in a while, so we’ve got nothing to lose,” Gragg said. “Just be able to look your brother in the eye and say you gave it all you had and that’s what these guys proved today.” The first drive of the game for Scotland County set the tone for the night, but the game was still up for grabs going to the third quarter. Scotland County’s senior Jade Holt changed that as he took a pitch down to the left side and sprinted untouched 46 yards to push the score to 21-0 and out of reach for Milan. “It was something that we started watching and overloaded one side and ran an option back away from that,” Gragg said. “He was able to take it and stay inbounds and get in for a touchdown. It was a great run.” While Scotland County managed to roll up over 350 yards of offense against Milan, it was the defense that stole the show. Scotland County held Milan to under 150 yards of offense and a measly 3.2 yards per play. “It was one of the things that we challenged the kids before the game to come out and be like a little torpedo and seek out the ball and destroy it when you get there,” Gragg said. “That’s what these kids did tonight, they did that and made plays, each and every one of them. I’m very proud of them.” One of the biggest changes for Scotland County was the very literal change of position for some of their key players. Chester Robinson, normally a linebacker, was moved to the nose tackle position in anticipation for the game. “They moved us around and put us in our strongest positions, some positions where we’ve never played before but what they thought was best for us,” Robinson said. Aaron Buford got a chance to see it from his safety position and pointed out that it was everyone on the line that really won the day. “Mainly on defense, our front five was huge tonight. They’re big up front but with Chester, you can’t block him. He’s one of the strongest, scrappiest players in the districts,” Buford said. Page 2 of 2 - Milan coach John Dabney admits that his team lost in the trenches tonight against the physical Scotland County line. “We couldn’t get any push, really. You’ve got to out-block people. The battle up front, I really think they controlled the line of scrimmage. There wasn’t too many creases there,” Dabney said. “They’re a good football team up front and won the battle in the trenches.” For Milan, the season comes to an end a little earlier than it has gotten used to but Dabney points out that the future is bright for his team. “We’ve got 99 percent coming back and kids who are going to be in the weight room. We played four freshmen on defense, so they learned a lot and they’re going to continue to move on. We’ll live to play another day,” Dabney said. Scotland County will advance to the second round of the playoffs and hit the road against the No. 2 seeded Paris Coyotes on Friday. “For us, it’s all about moving on. I know that Paris is a good passing team and they run the ball well. They match up well with what we like to do, so it’s going to probably be another slugfest because they’re very well-coached and they do a lot of good things,” Gragg said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:48:40.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
