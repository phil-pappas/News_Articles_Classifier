I have spoken with a couple of them in camp and the signal I had was positive.' \n'It is just a friendly but do your best for Ghana and your good selves for record purposes, we have become a powerhouse due to our exploits in our first two World Cups so I know they will guard against that.' \nHe added, 'Our absence in this game offers opportunity for other players, especially the new comers so they should grab it and make very good use of it. I know they will shine so brightly.' \nInjury has robbed the Stars of four key players-Gyan, Dede Ayew, Christian Atsu and Rabiu Mohammed for tomorrow's game in Washington, US. \nKofi Owusu Aduonum", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:15:25.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
