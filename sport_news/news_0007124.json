Klein (concussion) and offensive tackle Daryl Williams (knee). \nAllen was injured during the Panthers' first game against Tampa Bay in Week 4. He has been experiencing numbness in his legs ever since. \nThe Panthers will get middle linebacker Luke Kuechly and wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery back on Sunday. Kuechly has missed the last three games with a concussion, while Cotchery has missed two games with a sprained ankle. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
