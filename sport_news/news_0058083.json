(Andrew Matthews/PA via AP) UNITED KINGDOM OUT \nEXETER, England (AP) — Italy ended its Rugby World Cup campaign with an entertaining 32-22 win against a valiant Romania on Sunday to secure third place in Pool D and automatically qualify for the 2019 tournament. \nRomania made the biggest comeback in World Cup history when it rallied from 15-0 down to beat Canada 17-15 in midweek, but ran out of time for more heroics. \nBut the Oaks did brilliantly to stop a landslide defeat, having trailed 22-3 at halftime and then 29-3 when No. 8 Alessandro Zanni burrowed through a gap six minutes into the second half. \nScrumhalf Edoardo Gori, right winger Leonardo Sarto, and flyhalf Tommaso Allan touched down for Italy in the first half. \nIf Romania’s players could market their refusal to accept defeat, they would be overnight millionaires, and they roared back with a vengeance with three tries in the last 15 minutes. \nRomania’s rolling maul finally kicked into gear, resulting in a try from replacement left winger Adrian Apostol, who took a feed from No. 8 Daniel Carpo and dotted over. \nThat made it 29-10 with 13 minutes remaining and, just to be safe, Allan took a penalty kick in front of the posts, drawing some jeers from the try-hungry crowd at Sandy Park who wanted Italy to run the ball. \nBut there was more at stake than entertainment value, and the Italians were right to be cautious in light of Romania’s never-say-die attitude. \nLock Valentin Poparlan barged his way over for a try he was not even aware he had scored, until it was awarded following one of several television referrals that stalled an otherwise flowing game. \nThen, with one minute remaining, Apostol capped off a sweeping move with another try down the left, prompting a jubilant reaction from him, and an even bigger one from coach Lynn Howells. \nBut it was too late. \nItaly finished behind Six Nations rivals Ireland and France — who played their pool decider late Sunday — and Romania ended in fourth spot. \nIn a one-sided first half, Italy had two more tries ruled out for knock-ons. \nIf Romania had only started the tournament the way it finished, perhaps Howell’s teams would be booking tickets in 2019 to Tokyo. \nRomania was missing inspirational captain and No. 8 Mihai Macovei, scorer of both tries against Canada, but suspended for a dangerous tackle during that match. \nItaly was also missing its talismanic No. 8, with captain Sergio Parisse, sidelined with a niggling calf injury. \nThe loss of Parisse affected Italy early on. \nOn the first scrum, Romania’s pack shoved Italy back several meters, won a penalty, and inside center Florin Vlaicu — who landed the match-winning penalty goal against Canada — gave Romania a fifth-minute lead. \nItaly hit straight back, as Gori burst through in midfield, chased his own kick and beat Romania fullback Catalin Fercu for pace. But referee Romain Pote asked for a television referral, which showed that he knocked on. \nItaly took its next chance, as outside center Michele Campagnaro fed Sarto for a try in the left corner. Allan missed the conversion from wide left, but landed a penalty soon after as Romania lock Johannes van Heerden was sin-binned for tripping. \nItaly made the most of the extra man. \nAlthough hooker Andrea Manici crossed the line and knocked on, Gori made up for his earlier miss when he darted over from close range for a converted try. \nThen, Italy’s defense withstood 11 Romanian attacking phases, gradually sapping their energy — but never their belief.
