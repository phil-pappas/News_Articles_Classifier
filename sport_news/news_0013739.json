(AP Photo/Sang Tan) \nNYON, Switzerland— All 54 European soccer nations on Thursday backed UEFA President Michel Platini’s fight to clear his name and overturn FIFA’s suspension. \nThe support, which was announced through a UEFA statement, did not follow a vote in the meeting of UEFA members at its headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland and offered no view on the case itself. \nPlatini and FIFA President Sepp Blatter were suspended for 90 days last week by the FIFA ethics committee following an investigation into a payment from soccer’s world governing body. \nWhile Blatter has been replaced at FIFA by acting president Issa Hayatou, Platini retains the UEFA presidency and salary despite officially being banned. \n“Currently the president of UEFA is only suspended by FIFA,” UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino said. “For the time being he does receive his salary as he does continue being UEFA president.” \nPlatini also still hopes to stand in the Feb. 26 FIFA presidential election, even though it seems hard for him to be declared eligible once the candidate integrity checks are conducted after Oct. 26. \n“Why should Mr. Platini withdraw his candidacy if he is convinced he has done nothing wrong and he can clear his name?” Infantino said. “Let’s give him the chance to defend himself, to clear his name.” \nBut UEFA members of FIFA’s executive committee will use the meeting in Zurich next week to discuss options for a potential alternative European candidate to Platini. \nThe ethics case centers on 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) Platini received from FIFA in 2011. He says the money was unpaid additional salary from his job as Blatter’s adviser between 1998 and 2002. \nBefore Thursday’s meeting, several European associations said they wanted more details on why Platini waited nine years to collect the money, which was not covered by a written contract. It was unclear if they received the answers they wanted.

Platini said he did not receive his full salary by 2002 because FIFA could not afford to pay him.

Because of his ban from any role in soccer, Platini was not allowed to attend Thursday’s meeting. The payment is also being investigated by the Swiss attorney general. \nHours before being suspended last week, Platini submitted his election paperwork to FIFA. \n“Michel Platini is already a candidate for the FIFA presidency,” Infantino said, overlooking the fact that status is only declared by FIFA’s election committee. \nPrince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan is the only other hopeful to formally submit his candidacy to FIFA, which includes nominations from five federations. \nUEFA executives are still discussing whether another candidate should be put forward as a backup in case Platini is ineligible. \nAs UEFA members met Thursday, Hayatou spent his first day at FIFA headquarters in Zurich as acting president and addressed the staff. \n“It’s certainly an unprecedented situation for FIFA,” Hayatou said in comments provided by FIFA. “But we remain focused on the necessary reform process, the presidential election and on supporting the current investigations. To restore public trust is a crucial objective. It is essential that FIFA carries on its mission of developing the game and staging international tournaments.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:04:51.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
