He took his leave with a wry grin, a sassy flounce of his dreadlocks and a nod to the crowd that had so lustily taunted him and might even take some of the credit for his implosion.\nThree homers for the Jays — after failing to launch a ball out of the park in the first two games of the American League Championship Series — were obviously a massive part of the 11-8 outcome which brought Toronto back to within close-quarters combat with the Royals.\nYet the contest took its moral substance, its defining grace note — arguably, its turning point — in the early strokes of the affair, when Marcus Stroman was still dodgy and quite vulnerable on the bump, getting hit hard by the Royals, and fortunate to be just one-in-the-hole after the first, which started with a leadoff triple by Alcides Escobar.\nThen “The Goat” came to bat, Capricornus, who wore the horns in Game 2: Ryan Goins, who may or may not have been the cock-up-ee in that plop-pop that turned the momentum back in Kauffman Stadium. But let’s not go there again in too much detail, just enough to remind how downcast and mea-culpa the defensively stalwart second baseman had been afterwards, standing up in the clubhouse and taking his lumps like a man.\n“My grandma told me she loved me, so that was good,” said Goins. “Everybody was just saying, it wasn’t my fault. At the time you feel bad about it and nobody felt worse than me.’’\nSo here he comes to the plate on Monday night, lugging his puny .087 average — 2-for-23 in the post-season, mostly an easy-peasy out at the best of times down in the No. 9 spot. And the Jays had been hideous with runners in scoring position in the playoffs, just 3-for-23 as Game 3 dawned.\nIt would have been so easy to predict this at-bat, like counting cards. But baseball can be whimsical that way, picking its heroes off the scrap heap when in the mood, providing a virtuous redemptive boost to the maligned and vilified.\nHad there been any smiles out of Goins these past couple of days?\nGoins worked the count from 1-2 to 3-2 in the nervy at-bat, before lining a slider to left that scored Troy Tulowitzki and Kevin Pillar, the latter getting on base on a fielder’s choice, stealing second, and then motoring all the way around to make it 3-1. Pillar had no business getting under the tag with his slide, really, but he profited from the huge lead he had taken off second base as Cueto went to his wind-up.\nJosh Donaldson’s sharp single to left would bring Goins home — veritably bounding across the plate, pumping his fist.\nJose Bautista, who had been on deck — and had been the other half of that mystifying (called-it-did-not-call-it) pop-up blunder in Kansas City — gave Goins an affectionate pat on the bum as he trotted back towards the dugout, where he was pummeled by Stroman and the rest of his mates.\nBautista had earlier tweeted out: “Had to bribe him into liking me again rgoins2# Sarcasm’’\nThis was accompanied by a photo of the slugger and the shortstop mugging it up as they left a store — Sunday? — weighted down with bags full of Canada Goose outfitter freebies, because it was Bautista’s birthday, far as I can deduct.\nAnyway, those two RBIs up against the two-out pit-and-the-pendulum might have been the sweetest spot of the night for Goins, regardless of what came next. Except what came next was mighty succulent — his first playoff homer, a solo blast off reliever Kris Medlin in the fifth that accounted for Toronto’s 10th run on the Jays’ ninth hit.\n“To come back today and perform well and help the team win is a great feeling,” he said. “Probably the last thought in my head today was what happened Sunday, or whenever it was (Saturday).”\nNow let’s move along to the top of the seventh when Goins brought the delirious crowd to its feet with a terrific stab and pivot on a ball off the bat of Lorenzo Cain that would otherwise have scooted into the outfield. But that’s the kind of defensive clutch for which Goins is known. He shared those honours last night with double-play partner Tulowitzki, at least until Tulowitzki (a single, a three-run homer, and gaudy both ways on this evening) was ejected for arguing balls and strikes.\nYet maybe the most endearing image of Goins in this game came immediately after that 4-3 put-out, when he missed the ball diving to his left on a single to right by Eric Hosmer. Goins planted himself face first into the artificial greensward, in exaggerated dismay. And then he began making snowman motions, like a kid playing in the snow.\nHe’s 27, nowhere near a kid anymore, though Goins does carry around with him that suggestion of eternal youthfulness. Maybe it’s the boy-face, or the continuing shy reserve in the clubhouse, the eyes that grow round and almost alarmed in the midst of a media scrum.\nWhich didn’t hurt anywhere near so much last night, in the afterglow, did it?\n“Hopefully we can take two more and go back there with the lead,” said Goins. “We don’t feel like our backs are against the wall like most people seem to think.”\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays rediscover their swagger in Game 3: Arthur\nBlue Jays make amends in Game 3 win over Royals: Griffin", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:10:15.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
