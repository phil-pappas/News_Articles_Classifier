The Terps held the Wolverines to six points in the first half and seemed poised to keep the game within striking distance until a few big plays opened the floodgates. \nThe defense forced three fumbles and recovered two while intercepting Michigan quarterback Jake Rudock once. In the first half, the Terps held a Michigan running game missing starting running back De'Veon Smith to 43 yards on the ground in the first half, and they largely limited Rudock early on, aside from a long pass to tight end Jake Butt on a screen pass that set up a field goal. \n\"Guys played hard,\" Edsall said Sunday. \"We have a bunch of guys running to the ball. We watched the film. The guys were running to the ball. Guys were taking advantage of the situations in terms of seeing some loose balls hanging in there in terms of them carrying the ball and we knocked some out.\" \nDown the stretch, Maryland couldn't hold back Michigan, and the Wolverines gained 214 yards and scored 22 points in the first half. But it was a solid rebound performance for a unit that had been shredded by West Virginia a week earlier in a 45-6 loss. \n\"It carried over from what you saw in practice during the week,\" Edsall said. \nHarbaugh brothers roam sidelines \nBaltimore Ravens coach Jim Harbaugh joined his brother Jim, the Michigan coach, on the sideline for the Wolverines' victory over Maryland on Saturday. Thanks to the NFL schedule — the Ravens beat Pittsburgh on the road Thursday night — John was able to attend his brother's game. And the significance wasn't lost on Jim. \n\"It is an honor to be on the sideline with him,\" Jim Harbaugh said. \"I think everybody felt that way. He is a longtime friend with a lot of our coaches. He gave really good input during the game. He is somebody I love, obviously, and am proud of. It was great to have him here at the ballgame. I think it's cool for our players. They really liked it. The players talked to him after in the locker room. It is good to have him get to know our team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:39:34.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
