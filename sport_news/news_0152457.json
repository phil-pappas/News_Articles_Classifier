The crush is expected to be so big the school has urged anyone without a ticket for the Alabama game to stay away from the campus. \nAfter coasting in their first four games against teams without a winning record, the Bulldogs finally get a chance to make a statement in the SEC on Saturday against Alabama. The atmosphere around Georgia has been nothing short of frenzied. \nThe importance of the game is not lost on either team as they prepare for the 3:30 p.m. kickoff at Sanford Stadium. \n“A lot of people have been excited about this for a while, at least that’s what I hear,” Georgia coach Mark Richt said. “I know we’re excited because we’re playing them this week.” \n“Any time you play what is arguably one of the best teams in the country — Georgia — based on what they’ve been able to do over the past four games, and I’m talking about a total complete team,\" Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said. \nThe eighth-ranked Bulldogs need the win to take control of the SEC East. No. 13 Alabama needs it to keep from falling to 0-2 in league play. \nThe key for the Crimson Tide will be their front seven, especially LB Reuben Foster and DE Jarran Reed , and how they play against Georgia RB Nick Chubb. \n“The best seven in America,” Chubb said. “They haven’t allowed anyone to rush for 100 yards on them this year. We’ve had over 200 yards in the last couple games and we’re doing a great job running the ball and throwing the ball.” \nBuzz brings instant notoriety for Freeze \nOle Miss coach Hugh Freeze has been so busy winning games he hasn’t had time to understand how others have embraced the Rebels success. \nHe also knows such accolades can be fleeting. \n“I think society keeps you from pinching yourself,” Freeze said as No. 3 Ole Miss prepared for Saturday’s SEC showdown at No. 25 Florida. “This world with social media and instant gratification, and fans who want you to be what they feel you should be, it keeps you from pinching yourself. \n“Like you said, we started this journey three years and four games ago. I didn’t promise anyone anything then, of what we could get done here, with the exception that you can expect us to have fantastic effort, great attitude and that we were going to try to make this program relevant both in the SEC and nationally.” \nVols have no starters for Arkansas game \nTennessee coach Butch Jones doesn’t believe in identifying first- and second-string players. He instead has a game plan for each situation. \n“We don’t have starters,” he said as the Vols prepared to host Arkansas. “We have individuals who take the first snap. The old days of a depth chart, of 21 personnel, and huddle offenses and all that, those days are long gone. It's whoever finishes up the week of practice, with practice today, meetings and all that, they'll take the first repetition.” \nEtc. \nTickets for next year’s game between Virginia Tech and Tennessee at the Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway will go on sale Friday, the speedway announced. The non-conference game on Sept. 10, could set a national attendance record since the track has more than 150,000 seats. The NCAA record is 115,109 at Michigan Stadium. … Ole Miss-Florida and Alabama-Georgia aren’t the only SEC conference games involving Top 25 teams. No. 21 Mississippi State travels to No. 14 Texas A&M. The teams have a combined to average 74.5 points a game while giving up just 36.8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:32:18.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
