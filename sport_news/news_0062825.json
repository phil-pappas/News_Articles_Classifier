A bigger and more experienced Monte Vista came to town and shut out the Bobcats 41-0. Presley Garcia, Michael Valdez and Keshaun Duran led the way for Monte Vista with two touchdowns each. Ignacio quarterback Zach Weinreich threw for 130 yards but was intercepted twice by the oppsing defense. The Bobcats hung in there early and trailed only 6-0 at the end of the first frame after an 11-play 64-yard drive led to the first Monte Vista touchdown. The long drive wore down Ignacioâ€™s defense. It was 20-0 at half, and the Pirates poured it on in the third quarter, adding three scores to make it 41-0 at the end of three, where it stayed until the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:18:35.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
