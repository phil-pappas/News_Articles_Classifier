He totaled four TDs on the day — three rushing and one receiving — and has 18 rushing touchdowns on the season. He entered the game third in the country among rushing leaders and now has 1,393 yards on the season. \nFordham (7-1, 3-0 Patriot League) appeared to take control when Jihaad Pretlow intercepted Brad Mayes and returned it 23 yards early in the fourth quarter to give the Rams a 52-28 lead. But Mayes responded with back-to-back scoring drives capped by an 8-yard scoring completion to Sasha Kelsey and a 22-yarder to Kelsey. \nLehigh (3-4, 1-1) forced a three-and-out and drove 49 yards in 11 plays before Ed Mish missed a 34-yard field goal attempt. \nMayes finished with 203 yards and two touchdowns but threw three interceptions. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:40:00.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
