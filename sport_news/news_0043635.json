Lee Westwood has resigned his PGA tour membership and is returning to Europe.\nAdChoices Westwood was ranked No. 4 in the world when he moved to Florida three years ago in an attempt to improve his short game and win his first major title. Intead, he has dropped to 44th in the world rankings and is still without a major in his career.\nWestwood, 42, split from his wife Laurae over the summer, and she has returned to Scotland with their two children, Sam and Poppy.\n\"I think it's fair to say that while living in the States my career didn't move in the direction I wanted it to move, but obviously that's not the reason why I am doing this,\" Westwood told the Daily Mail.\n\"But it's nice to be back. There are a few events over here I've missed not playing in, and I've dropped a lot in the world rankings, so I need to address that.\"\nWestwood managed just one top-three finish in 52 events as a PGA Tour member. He needs to stay within the top 50 in the world rankings to maintain his privileges to play in the World Golf Championship Events and others such as the Players Championship, considered the \"fifth major.\"\nHe also is trying to earn a spot on the European Ryder Cup team for the 10th consecutive time. Westwood admitted his personal life has impacted his golf game, but said he's willing to put in the work to regain his form.\n\"There's no magic wand you can ever wave to play good golf,\" Westwood told the Daily Mail. \"You just have to go back to basics and I'm prepared to work hard. I've got a 42-year-old's niggles but my back, hips, knees and shoulders are all in good shape, thankfully.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportsxchange.com/tsxfiles/topstories", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:58:45.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
