The Packers defeated the 49ers 17-3. (Photo by Michael Zagaris/San Francisco 49ers/Getty Images) 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's fall from grace this season has been well documented.\nAdChoices After a dreadful performance in a loss to the Seahawks on Thursday night, when Kaepernick completed just 13 of 24 passes for 124 yards. His offensive line didn't do him any favors, though, allowing six sacks.\nKaepernick, who burst onto the scene in 2012 and led the 49ers to a Super Bowl, has been on the hot seat and his coach, Jim Tomsula, has said that he will not be benched. However, FOX Sports NFL insider said that the players in the locker room are not completely behind Kaepernick.\n\"His confidence is completely shot,\" Glazer said on Sunday. \"It's not that (the players) don't like him. But he's just alone, on an island in that locker room. There's not a lot of people he connects with.\n\"Confidence wise he's just buried right now.\"\nKaepernick signed a team-friendly seven-year, $126 million contract before the start of the 2014 season, but that doesn't mean the 49ers plan to move from him, according to Glazer.\n\"They can move on from him at the end of the year provided he is not injured,\" Glazer reported. \"That's not the team's mindset. They look at him and say, 'this is the same guy that took us to the Super Bowl.'\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:04:18.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
