(Kathy Kmonicek / Associated Press) Bill Shaikin Contact Reporter \nMax Scherzer concluded his season in style, even if his team did not. \nThe Washington Nationals might be the most disappointing team in years, but their ace put a wrap on the year with one of the most dominant performances in major league history. Scherzer pitched his second no-hitter of the season, and struck out 17 batters, in a 2-0 victory over the New York Mets on Saturday. \nScherzer became the fifth pitcher to throw two no-hitters in a season, the first since Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan did it for the Angels in 1973, a historical context Scherzer said left him “speechless.” \nScherzer's 17 strikeouts set a career high and a Nationals record, and they were the most of any pitcher to throw a no-hitter without giving up a walk, two more than the record set by the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw last season. \n“To throw a no-hitter takes luck. I'll be the first one to say that,” Scherzer said. “If you want to be a dominant pitcher, you look at what you can control.” \nHe struck out nine consecutive batters before Curtis Granderson popped up to end the game. The only batter to reach based did so on an error by third baseman Yunel Escobar in the sixth inning. \n“Nothing but the utmost respect for him,” Scherzer said. “The play just didn't get made.” \nScherzer all but traded strikeouts with Mets ace Matt Harvey, who pitched six innings and struck out 11 batters. \n“It was almost like playing a game of horse,” Scherzer said. “If he makes a shot, I've got to make a shot.” \nThe Mets and Dodgers each were no-hit twice this season. However, as those teams prepare to meet in the National League playoffs, Scherzer and the Nationals will end their season Sunday. \n“It's been a disappointing season for the team, no doubt about it,” Scherzer said. “That's why this is bittersweet.” \nScherzer pitched the seventh no-hitter of the 2015 MLB season, tying the record for most in the modern era of the majors. The record was set in 1990 and repeated in 1991 and 2012. \nThe last no-hitter this season was thrown by Chicago Cubs right-hander Jake Arrieta in a 2-0 victory over the Dodgers on Aug. 30. \nAlso throwing no-hitters this season: Houston Astros right-hander Mike Fiers on Aug. 21 in a 3-0 victory over the Dodgers; Seattle Mariners right-hander Hisashi Iwakuma on Aug. 12 in a 3-0 win over the Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Phillies left-hander Cole Hamels, who is now with the Texas Rangers, on July 25 in a 5-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants rookie right-hander Chris Heston on June 9 in a 5-0 win over the New York Mets. \nMORE FROM BASEBALL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:49:22.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
