Unfortunately for Glencross, the development really shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise given how the summer went. \nGlencross was one of many veteran players who faced the same predicament this offseason. He had enough of a recent track record to suggest he could still play (13 goals the previous season, 12 in less than half a season in 2013-14 and 15 in the lockout-shortened 2013 campaign), but teams weren’t interested. Players like Lee Stempniak (32) and Daniel Paille (31) had equally frustrating summers. \nThe reason, as one agent said during the summer, was that teams preferred to have youngsters on entry-level contracts in depth roles rather than veterans, even if the veterans were more capable. Having young players gaining experience while making little money is the most ideal way to be competitive long-term, though it’s a method that might end careers early or force players overseas. \n“Teams are saying they want to give younger players an opportunity to make the team,” the agent said during the summer, calling it a “league-wide trend.” \nThat trend showed in free agency. This summer, 248 players changed organizations in free agency, the lowest total of free agents signed in the last seven years (and likely well beyond that; it’s tougher to track earlier than 2009). The number was a sizable drop from the previous summer, when 307 free agents were signed. \nGlencross, Stempniak, Paille and numerous others settled for professional tryouts with teams. Stempniak ended up getting a one-year, $850,000 contract from the Devils, while Paille was released from his PTO with the Blackhawks before settling for a deal with the Hawks’ AHL team. Glencross left camps in Toronto and Colorado without a contract. \nShould the trend continue, one Bruin who could find his career at a crossroads earlier than expected is Chris Kelly . Turning 35 next month and in the final year of his contract, Kelly is clearly still a good NHL player. Given that his role is served as a bottom-six forward and penalty killer, however, teams could overlook him in free agency. It’s worth noting that Gregory Campbell , an inferior player, got a two-year contract this season, but his experience in free agency was more the exception than the rule for players in his position. \nKelly said he doesn’t plan to retire at the end of the season. Then again, he understands that a lot of good players who sweated out the summer didn’t intend to either. \n“It’s October,” Kelly said with a grin Wednesday. “I’m definitely not thinking about June or July. I’ve got a full season to play and then we’ll go from there. I’ve always been the type to worry about what you can control. That’s something that’s out of my control. What I can control is how I play and that’s what you need to focus on.” \nKelly is in the last year of a four-year, $12 million deal signed prior to the lockout. Though his $3 million cap hit has been steep for the last couple of seasons due to his lack of offensive production, he’s been a valuable third-liner who has balanced lines centered by offensive centers such as Carl Soderberg and Ryan Spooner. Wednesday saw him score his second goal of the season, a shorthanded tally in what was eventually an overtime loss to the Flyers. \nDepending on how he fares this season, Kelly should figure to at be a fourth-line option with either the Bruins or another team after the season, but this summer’s free agents learned that getting jobs they might deserve is not a given. Though Kelly is older than the likes of Paille or Glencross, he feels he’s got plenty left in his legs. \n“I came in this year feeling better than I have any other year,” Kelly said. “Age is a mindset. If you think you’re old, then you’re old. If you think you’re young, then that youth will always stay with you. You’re surrounded by younger and younger players, which is great for the game because I feel the same way I did maybe when I broke into the league. Obviously, I’ve been around more than I was when I came into the league, but by no means do I feel any older.” \nIt’s a strange time to be veteran in the NHL . Last season showed that the jobs for role players don’t come as easily as they once did. Kelly knows that means players who still have something to offer might not get the chance to. \n“The end comes to us all, regardless of whether you’re a Hall of Famer or a guy that’s played a short stint in the NHL or pro hockey,” he said. “Eventually, it ends.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:00:45.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
