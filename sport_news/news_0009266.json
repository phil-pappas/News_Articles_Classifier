The Spartans remain unbeaten and on track for a showdown with top-ranked Ohio State next month. \nKEY MATCHUP \nIndiana QB Nate Sudfeld vs. Michigan State's secondary. The Spartans' defensive backfield has been weakened by injuries, and that could play into Indiana's hands if Sudfeld has time to throw. Sudfeld passed for 464 yards in a 55-52 loss to Rutgers last weekend. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nIndiana: WR Ricky Jones. He's been Sudfeld's top target this season, with 32 catches for 624 yards and four touchdowns. \nMichigan State: QB Connor Cook. When the running game was stifled against Michigan, Cook helped the Spartans move the ball with some tough throws under pressure. He seems to be hitting his stride in his final season at Michigan State. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nMichigan State has won six straight against Indiana and 14 of 16. ...
