After day one of the state tournament, the two teams sit atop the team leaderboard.\n“There is a lot of tennis and a lot of things that can happen so we are just happy to be up here,” Knights coach John La Cognata said. “We’re happy to have a chance to play all of our positions on Saturday and see what happens.”\nLone Peak is perfect through the first two rounds of play with none of its players losing a match. The Knights are going into Saturday with 10 points, the most of any team. The Darts are right behind with nine points.\n“As a team we are still in the thick of things,” Davis coach Andy Wahlstorm said. “We can take care and win most of those semifinal matches, we’ll still have a great shot as a team.”\nThe Darts will have a slight disadvantage at winning the tournament as their first doubles team was eliminated in the second round. Junior Quincy Bowcut and freshman Abbie Dana won their first-round match in two sets. The duo played against Jordan’s team, senior Tabby Jones and junior Hannah Dutson, in the second round. Bowcut and Dana were only able to win the first set against the Beetdiggers and lost the match.\n“We advanced four of the five positions in the semifinals, obviously that’s a very good day, but I wanted all five,” Wahlstrom said.\nDavis’ first singles player, junior Whitney Turley, cruised through her first two rounds, only dropping three games. Turley looks to follow in her older sister Breezy’s footsteps and win the first singles state title, although there is a strong chance that she will be challenged by last year’s runner-up, Lone Peak senior Leah Heimuli.\nTurley and Heimuli’s relationship is more than just competitors. They are actually really good friends. When the two are not against each other, they play as a doubles team in Intermountain and national tournaments.\n“Off the court they are like best friends,” Wahlstrom said. “Turley is a fierce competitor on the court but she is also a great friend. Even a loss to Heimuli, Whitney would be able to find that silver lining and be happy for her friend.”\nWhile it looks like the Knights and Darts will be battling to the end for the team title, it might be Viewmont that steals it away. The Vikings currently sit two points behind Davis. Viewmont only has two players left in the tournament. It may not be probable, but if both win in the finals, there is a possibility of an upset.\nThursday\nRound 1\n1st singles\nJennie Milne, Jordan, def.
