Gould is also the Bears’ record holder for career field goals made (252).\nHe needs only five points to surpass Kevin Butler (1,116) and become the Bears’ all-time leading scorer.\nChicago’s special teams haven’t looked great in most spots this season, but when Gould’s kicking it usually bodes well.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/BearDown?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bears?src=hash", "http://t.co/vwDQTY16jf", "https://twitter.com/paytonsun/status/650766171835363328", "https://twitter.com/ChicagoBears/status/651781741129109504", "https://twitter.com/CLTVSportsFeed", "https://twitter.com/RobbieGould09", "http://t.co/2qgYKIGSTl"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:07:03.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
