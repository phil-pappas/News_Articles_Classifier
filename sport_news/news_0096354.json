The victory moved Thongchai to 32nd in the world rankings and eighth in the prestigious Race to Dubai. \nIt was also his third win on European soil, his first four titles coming in European Tour events held in Asia. Remarkably, all three of the wins in Europe have come since he turned 40. \nWinning in Europe gives him particular satisfaction. “It’s the third time I’ve won outside Asia, so I’m very happy with that,” he said on Sunday. \nHis first success in Europe was the Wales Open in 2012, followed by the 2014 Nordea Masters in Sweden where he outlasted Ryder Cup stars Victor Dubuisson and Stephen Gallacher in an exciting play-off. In fact that was the last victory by an Asian player on the European Tour, until Thongchai achieved it again last week. \nIn addition to that he has enjoyed 13 Asian Tour triumphs, topping the tour’s Order of Merit on three occasions. \nNow that’s not bad at all for someone who didn’t turn professional until he was 30. In fact Thongchai didn’t start playing golf until he was 16, something almost unheard of in these days when toddlers are hardly out of the pram before they pick up the clubs. \nIt is also a reminder that golf is one sport in which Thailand has produced truly world-class competitors. Thongchai’s win was the third by a Thai on the European Tour this year. The talented Kiradech Aphibarnrat also triumphed in China and Scotland. \nAround the world everyone seems familiar with “Jaidee” as he is known outside of Thailand, and with his pleasant personality he is a great ambassador, not only for golf, but the kingdom itself. \nWith his early success in Asia it would have been easy for Thongchai to rest on his laurels and remain in the Orient where he would most likely have piled up the trophies and lived a very comfortable life. \nBut he was more ambitious than that, determined to prove himself on a bigger stage, hence his progress on the European Tour. He knew it wouldn’t be easy and it wasn’t. Everything was different — the weather, the culture, the food and the golf courses. \nBut he quickly adapted. After his first lengthy spell in Europe he returned to Thailand with renewed confidence. \n“I’ve really enjoyed it in Europe,” he told the Post in 2006. “I’ve learned so much. Everything is different there and the weather can change every day — it’s rainy, then sunny, then windy.” \nThongchai soon made a lot of friends on the European Tour and found himself playing with the likes of Colin Montgomerie, Paul McGinley, Padraig Harrington, Graeme McDowell and Miguel Angel Jimenez. \nMontgomerie was one of the first to recognise Thongchai’s potential, saying he was the best Asian player he had ever competed against. \nThongchai appreciated the reception he received In Europe. “Everyone was friendly and I felt very comfortable with players, no matter what nationality.” \nThe Thai veteran’s command of English also improved dramatically after a couple of seasons in Europe and that undoubtedly played a part in boosting his confidence, reflected by better displays in tournaments. \nHis taste in food also broadened. “I am very lucky because there are Thai restaurants in most European cities,” he said. “But if there isn’t I can eat European food.” \nThongchai’s golf improved so much he has become a familiar face at the world’s top events and he has now competed in an impressive 27 majors. He caused some consternation there when it was discovered that at his five-star hotel in Tulsa he slept every night on the bedroom floor because the bed was too soft! \nHis best result in a major is 13th place at the Open at Turnberry in 2009. \nThongchai has also played a leading role in representative golf for Asia against Europe in the Royal Trophy and against Japan in the Dynasty Cup. In 2014 he was appointed playing captain of the Asian team in the inaugural EurAsian Cup, and led an Asian fightback on the final day to secure a nail-biting 10-10 draw. \nHe has developed into a very consistent tee-to-green player and when his putter, which occasionally lets him down, is hot he’s a threat in any tournament. \nNext week, Thongchai faces a totally new challenge, the Presidents Cup in which he will be playing for the International team against the US in Incheon, South Korea. \nThongchai will be playing with and against the best golfers in the world, but that won’t bother him — just the opposite in fact. He loves a challenge and you won’t get a bigger challenge than taking on the likes of Jordan Spieth, Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson. \nThe Thai veteran has some pretty useful golfers on his own side too, including Jason Day, Louis Oosthuizen, Adam Scott and Charle Schwartzel. \nThongchai is a true professional and has the mental strength to know he can compete with the best. Despite his success, Thongchai remains a humble man and devoted to his family, wife (and manager) Namfon, and their two boys, Titituch and Kittituch.
