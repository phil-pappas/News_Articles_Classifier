(Photo: Mark Zaleski / AP) \nJulio Jones caught an 8-yard touchdown pass to give the Falcons their first lead of the game, 10-7, against the Titans with 5:56 remaining in the third quarter Sunday at Nissan Stadium. \nThe reception capped a nine-play, 88-yard drive that lasted 4½ minutes. \nThe Titans led 7-3 at halftime. Zach Mettenberger found Kendall Wright streaking across the middle of the field for a 19-yard touchdown in the second quarter, the first score of the game, which came moments after a remarkable turnover. Titans linebacker David Bass, claimed off waivers before the start of the season, tipped and intercepted a Matt Ryan pass at the line of scrimmage to give Tennessee the ball at the Atlanta 19 with just under nine minutes remaining in the first half. \nTennessee was threatening to add to its lead, but Mettenberger was intercepted by linebacker Paul Worrilow at the Falcons’ 4-yard line with 18 seconds to play. The pick scuttled a 10-play, 74-yard drive. Live: Titans 7, Falcons 3 \nThe Titans (1-4) are playing without Marcus Mariota, who missed practice all week because of a sprained ligament in his left knee. They’re trying to snap a four-game losing streak and eight-game skid at home. They haven’t won in Nashville since defeating the Jaguars 16-14 on Oct. 12, 2014. \nMettenberger, a sixth-round draft pick in 2014, started six of the seven games he played last season, all losses. \nMatt Bryant hit a 27-yard field goal with 2½ minutes remaining in the first half, after Falcons (5-1) star receiver Julio Jones was unable to secure a catch in the end zone. Titans cornerback Jason McCourty injured his hamstring on the play and walked unassisted into the locker room, but was on the field to begin the second half. \nThe Titans are playing without starting cornerback Perrish Cox (hamstring) and starting safety Michael Griffin (knee). \nThey're also down to their third-string center. Joe Looney, who was signed this week after a season-ending ankle injury to starter Brian Schwenke, started the second half after Andy Gallik suffered a stinger on Mettenberger's interception.
