They would free-release the back a few times. A lot of the stuff was the shallow crossers and the stuff underneath. \n\"Anytime the quarterback's on that clock where he's going deliberately get it out sooner, he knows, in his own internal clock, he's not going to sit in the pocket. There's no seven-step drop, it's going to be difficult to get to him.\" \nEarly in the game, the Browns were able to distract Rivers and the Chargers, and the 33-year-old veteran quarterback missed on his first four throws of the game. However, he engineered five response drives that ended in points after the Browns either tied the game or took a lead. \n\"There were a number of one-on-one rushes that I didn't win,\" Browns outside linebacker Paul Kruger said. \"Those are things that can't happen and those are rushes that I have to win. It took me too long to get in rhythm and I felt that the times I was getting there, it was too late in the game. It's a really tough loss, especially after the way our defense played at times. \n\"He has been a hell of a player for a long time and he's a guy you have to respect. He can hurt you in a lot of different ways. One thing he does well is adjust during the game. He finds ways to make game-time adjustments during a play that can hurt you. He is a good player and has been a steady guy for a long time.\" \nRookie defensive lineman Xavier Cooper added, \"Philip is a competitor and I hear him out there competing just like everybody else and talking to his guys. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league and great at getting guys to jump offsides.\" \nAfter starting the game with four incompletions, Rivers elected to go with a hurry-up offense, and it paid dividends with a trip to the end zone for wide receiver Keenan Allen. Allen hauled in a 28-yard touchdown pass from Rivers in the back corner of the end zone with cornerback Pierre Desir providing tight coverage and gave the Chargers a 7-3 lead over the Browns with 48 seco nds to play in the first quarter . \nRivers led the Chargers down the field for 80 yards in just eight plays and in less than four minutes. \nAfter the Browns took a three-point lead on a field goal, the Chargers needed just three plays and 91 seconds to march 81 yards for a go-ahead score with 4:23 to play in the third quarte r . \nWith the Chargers starting the response drive at their own 19-yard line, Rivers went to work and sent a pass to running back Danny Woodhead in the middle of the field. The diminutive 5-foot-8 Woodhead turned upfield and hustled his way through the Browns' defense for a gain of 61 yards before safety Tashaun Gipson tackled him at the Cleveland 19-yard line. \nWith Gipson, who was already questionable with a groin injury heading into the game, suffering an ankle injury on the tackle of Woodhead, Rivers went after the Browns' diminished secondary by lofting a pass to the end zone for tight end Ladarius Green. Green won the jump ball against a Browns defender and caught his second touchdown of the season. \nThen, with 7:26 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Chargers needed just five plays to travel 74 yards for a touchdown that extended their lead over the Browns to 27-19 w hen Rivers tossed a one-yard score to tight end John Phillips on second-and-goal. \nTwo plays earlier, the Browns had the Chargers backed up into a third-and-five at their own 31-yard line, but Rivers withstood the pressure from Cleveland's front seven and delivered a pass along the right side of the formation to wide receiver Dontrelle Inman, who was pressed into service after fellow pass catchers Malcom Floyd (concussion) and Stevie Johnson (hamstring) were knocked out of the game. \nInman caught the ball in stride, turned upfield and sprinted down the sideline before being tackled at the one-yard line by linebacker Barkevious Mingo. \n\"They hit us on some crossers,\" Pettine said. \"A couple were on us. A couple of them were good plays by them. They had the right call played against what we were in. We voided the middle of the field with pressure and they leaked Woodhead out, which was tough because they combined it with a crossing route and cleared out our one guy. \n\"They got us on that one. They made some good plays and we had some issues with some of the crosser stuff. It's frustrating, but for the guys that were in there, I thought Badi (Johnson Bademosi) did a good job. Justin (Gilbert) in the reps that he was in there, Pierre (Desir) hung in there. That's not exactly the easiest passing attack to go up against and those guys battled until the end.\" \nVeteran Tramon Williams added, \"When we came here, we knew what the scheme was, and there's no excuses to it. We come here, we believe in the scheme. We believe in the coaches. We've just got to get everything corrected. We're the ones playing. Whether we have to speak up a little bit more and say what we feel we need to do or whether we feel that we need more variety of things, we just need to step up and say it because once you look up, the season's going to be over. We've got to get it corrected now.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1Ld5wHX TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:46:33.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
