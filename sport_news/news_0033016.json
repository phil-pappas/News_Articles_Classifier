But he said when Patricia made landfall south after 6 p.m., they began to relax.\nPresident Enrique Pena Nieto issued a taped address late Friday, noting that while initial reports indicate damage has been less than those expected, \"We cannot yet let our guard down.\"\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said Patricia had weakened to a tropical depression by midday Saturday with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph). Remnants of the storm were expected to feed existing rainstorms hitting southern Texas.\nPeople walk along the beach under a steady rain as they await the arrival of Hurricane Patricia in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Friday, Oct. 23, 2015.

When the city was not feeling any major effects from the storm two hours after landfall, workers let them out to eat at a hotel restaurant.\nGalle said some guests desperate to leave had earlier paid $400 for taxis to drive them the 120 miles (200 kilometers) to the inland city of Guadalajara.\nWomen, children and senior citizens get a meal at a shelter set up in preparation for the arrival of Hurricane Patricia in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Friday, Oct. 23, 2015.

Within 30 hours it had zoomed to a Category 5 storm, catching many off guard with its rapid growth.\nBy Friday it was the most powerful recorded hurricane to hit the hemisphere, with a central pressure of 880 millibars and maximum sustained winds of 200 mph (325 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center.\nOne of the worst Pacific hurricanes to ever hit Mexico slammed into the same region, in Colima state, in October 1959, killing at least 1,500 people, according to Mexico's National Center for Disaster Prevention.\nPatricia also threatens Texas, where flooding already has caused a train derailment. Forecasters said that even after Patricia breaks, up its tropical moisture will likely feed heavy rains already soaking the state.\n———\nAP Science Writer Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1024/20151024__TropicalWeather~p4_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1024/20151024__TropicalWeather~p2_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1024/20151024__TropicalWeather~p5_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1024/20151024__TropicalWeather~p6_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1024/20151024__TropicalWeather~p3_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:07:43.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
