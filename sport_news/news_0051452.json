This is the end of the transformation . . . I think of it as investing in transforming a system that didn’t work.”\nAn email from Sandals released late Friday afternoon said this kind of expense has been in place since 2008. Since then, $3.741 million has been paid out to teacher unions.\nOn Monday, Sandals emphasized the changes to the bargaining process mean the payouts will not be needed in the future.\n“We will never, ever have to fund the unions again because the transformation will be done,” Sandals told reporters.\nMore on thestar.com\nFixing footbridge stairs is a step in the right direction: Fixer\nBarricades can't keep residents from using, and fixing, ravine stairs: Fixer", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:16:46.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
