Back | Next THE ASSOCIATED PRESS A win away from the ALCS and one loss away from winter, the Royals will send right-hander Johnny Cueto (0-0, 6.00 ERA) to the mound to take on Houston's Collin McHugh (1-0, 3.00 ERA). By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Kansas City Royals have had pretty good success when facing elimination games in the postseason dating back to last year. \nIn fact, the only elimination game they lost was Game 7 of last year’s World Series — granted that’s a biggie. The Royals were in a similar situation Monday in Houston, but they rallied with a dramatic win to keep their season alive, forcing a decisive Game 5 in the American League Division Series at 7:07 p.m. Wednesday at Kauffman Stadium. \nA win away from the ALCS and one loss away from winter, the Royals will send right-hander Johnny Cueto (0-0, 6.00 ERA) to the mound to take on Houston’s Collin McHugh (1-0, 3.00 ERA). \n“Obviously this is the deciding game,” Cueto said through interpreter Pedro Grifol after the Royals worked out Tuesday. “You either win and stay, or you go home. And I’m ready for the opportunity, and I’m going to go get them.” \nThe Astros certainly got the best of Cueto in Game 2. When Cueto left after the sixth inning, the Royals trailed 4-2 on the scoreboard as he gave up four runs on seven hits, including a home run, to go with three walks and five strikeouts. The Royals rallied for a 5-4 win, scoring two in the sixth and one in the seventh. \nRELATED — POLL: HOW WILL JOHNNY BE TONIGHT? VOTE HERE. \nThough not technically, Game 2 in many ways was an elimination game for the Royals. Had the Royals not won, their season — coupled with Dallas Keuchel’s gem in Game 3 — already would be over. But pitching in games like this is why the Royals acquired Cueto in late July, believing they had an ace up their sleeve for the postseason. \nCueto struggled, going 4-7 with a 4.76 ERA with the Royals during the regular season. One of Cueto’s four wins, however, came when the Royals clinched the division title, throwing seven innings of three-run ball. \nCueto will be making his fifth career postseason start, and the Royals are confident he will deliver. \n“It’s going to be a great game,” Royals catcher Salvador Perez said. “And you guys know what kind of pitcher he is. He’s been in that situation before, so he’s coming to win. He’s coming to pitch great and to compete and he’s going to fight. We’ll play hard and see what happens.” \nDuring his short tenure in Kansas City, Cueto has had an up-and-down relationship with the fans, experiencing both cheers and choruses of boos. Still, Cueto said he feels mostly support from a fan base that is seeking its first World Series title in 30 years. \n“There’s a lot of backing here,” Cueto said. “I feel great with the staff. I feel great with the players; they’re like brothers to me. The fans are awesome. The louder they get, the more energized I get.” \nA lot of money also is potentially on the line for Cueto, who as a pending free agent could be making his final appearance as a Royal. Cueto admitted he has thought about his free agency, but he is also focused on the immediate task at hand. \n“I’m not going to lie, at times it’s been very difficult to take that out of my mind,” Cueto said. “But the fact of the matter is I got to focus on pitching here and performing for this club and this organization.” \nThe Royals seemingly have all the momentum on their side, though manager Ned Yost said he didn’t think the Astros would be affected by the way Monday played out. \nNow he’s hoping his team can ride Monday’s momentum all the way to the Fall Classic. Anything short of that will be a disappointing end to an otherwise historic season, one that hinges on the outcome of Game 5. \n“Last year our focus was different,” Yost said. “We wanted to break a 29-year spell of not making it to the playoffs. And I felt like the wild-card game really wouldn’t mean anything, just making the wild-card game if we didn’t win. When we won, I felt like, ‘OK, we accomplished our goal.’ We wanted to get to the playoffs. And we eventually took it all the way to the World Series. But for me, that was kind of like a bonus. \n“This year it’s a different story. A minor goal, I guess you could say, was we wanted to win the division. We really did. But our ultimate goal was to win the World Series, and anything short of that is going to be a goal unaccomplished. It means a lot.” \n\nMatchup: Houston Astros vs. Kansas City Royals \nWhen/Where: 7:07 p.m. Wednesday, Kauffman Stadium, Kansas City, Mo. \nPitching matchup: Houston: RHP Collin McHugh (1-0, 3.00 ERA), Kansas City: RHP Johnny Cueto (0-0, 6.00 ERA) \nTV/Radio: Fox Sports 1, WIBW-AM (580) \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:26:34.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
