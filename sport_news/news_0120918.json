But did the defense's inability to stop the Bearcats foretell of problems for the University of Memphis's hopes to repeat as American Athletic Conference champions? What, if anything, can be done to shore up the shortcoming?\nChris Wallace: Yes, wrapped inside the huge nationally televised win were some definite defensive concerns for the Tigers. Cincinnati's redshirt freshman backup QB (Hayden Moore) passed for a ton of yardage after replacing injured starter Gunner Kiel. Obviously the Tiger secondary is a work in progress at this point. On the game-deciding play late in the fourth quarter, pressure on the Cincinnati QB resulted in the interception (by Leonard Pegues) that sealed the win. Getting additional pressure on opposing QBs is easier said than done but is the key to the Tigers slowing down prolific passing attacks.\nJason Smith: There's not a team in the American Athletic Conference that Memphis can't outscore and that alone should keep the Tigers on track to repeat as AAC champs. Does the defense need to improve? Of course. It's been a mess. But Memphis has shown it has some playmakers on that side of the ball. It just needs to get better at understanding and maintaining assignments. With so many new guys, that will come with experience. Until it does, the Tigers should blitz more. Memphis has shown it's not going to stop very many teams rushing three or four guys and sitting back. Might as well try to create some pressure and help out this worn-out secondary.\nNick Vergos: Memphis' defense will not cost it the AAC title. Paxton Lynch and the offense can compensate for any defensive inefficiencies in conference. The defense will cost Memphis in its attempt to crack the top 25. The win over Cincinnati (Sept. 24) was indeed a great win, but Memphis' defense was exposed again. I believe the Memphis defense can improve with personnel and scheme changes, but it will not be top tier this season.\nPeter Edmiston: The Tigers clearly have more than enough offense to entertain fans and ensure wins. That defense, though. Two of the Tigers' four opponents thus far are ranked in the top six nationally in total offense. It's a chicken-and-egg thing, though. Are the Tigers struggling on defense because they've played such great teams or have their opponents put up such great numbers because they've played Memphis? We'll know more after the South Florida game. The Bulls enter the game ranked 92nd offensively, so if they put up huge numbers, there's the answer. The Tigers need to establish a consistent pass rush, perhaps even at the cost of sending an extra defender at the quarterback on a regular basis. Without pressure, a young secondary will be very vulnerable.\nShaun Micheel: The defense has given up a lot this season. Big plays, a lot of points and yardage have been the thorn in the side of the coaches. Yet, they continue to make key defensive stands at the end of the game. Two things stand out. First, these Tigers have faced prolific offenses over the last two weeks. Secondly, our offense scores so quickly and forces the defense to spend a lot of time on the field. Certainly, the Tigers need to put more pressure on the opposing QB and get off of the field quicker. But, if we can stay healthy on the offensive side of the ball another conference title will find its way back to Memphis.\nThe SEC question\nEarning a bowl trip last season and opening with an impressive win over Bowling Green this season, Tennessee certainly seemed to have turned the corner under coach Butch Jones. But the Vols lost a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter against Florida last weekend, the second time it has happened this season. Is too much being written and said about the collapses against Oklahoma and Florida? Or are they just part of the rebuilding process?\nWallace: The late-game collapses against Oklahoma and Florida were frustrating for Tennessee fans, but keep in mind the Vols are a young team that has shown the talent and athleticism to compete against high-level competition. Tennessee will be bowl-eligible again this season and turn some of the recent heartbreaking losses into wins later in the year. Don't abandon ship Volunteer Navy!\nSmith: There were some huge coaching mistakes in that Florida loss and I don't think we should just chalk up those kinds of losses to being part of a \"rebuilding process.\" This was supposed to be Tennessee's year to return to national prominence. The Vols have that kind of talent. Jones better get it turned around quickly because Vols fans are tired of hearing that next year is going to be the year.\nVergos: The Tennessee football program has forgotten how to win the big game. For the past few seasons, UT has been an average team and has rarely had the opportunity to compete in close football games. Winning tough games in the fourth quarter is part of the rebuilding process. I expect Butch Jones and the Volunteer football players to rebound and win over a struggling Arkansas team this weekend.\nEdmiston: Butch Jones is 1-17 against ranked opponents as a head coach. Tennessee has lost two games this season in which the Vols had a 13-point fourth-quarter lead. Tennessee has thrown a grand total of nine pass attempts in the fourth quarter this season. The Vols managed to blow a 9-0 lead last season at home to what turned out to be a distinctly average Florida team. It isn't just youth. It isn't just \"learning how to win.\" Jones tightens up in pressure spots; his body language betrays the tenseness and fear of losing that has permeated his late-game decisions. His team plays that way, too. If he doesn't loosen up and calm down, his team will never get over that hump.\nMicheel: Blowing leads is contagious, especially when you have a coaching staff that abandons the game plan to try to hold on at the end. Sure, there was a Vol defensive breakdown on the last Florida drive, but the coaches lost the game before the Gators took that last possession. The recent Vol meltdowns have nothing to do with rebuilding. That's an excuse that coaches lay their hat on when things aren't going well. It's not fair to the kids to give the Vols that out. The domination that I saw against OU and Florida did not resemble a young and inexperienced team. If these \"breakdowns\" continue, Coach Jones, however, will be \"rebuilding\" another program.\nThe national question\nHow shocking was Utah's lopsided win over Oregon? And has Utah, in its fifth season in the Pac-12, begun to reap the benefits of being in a Power 5 conference?\nWallace: That Utah could win at Oregon was not stunning, but the 42-point margin of victory was a shocker! Utah is for real, if you do not believe me just ask Jim Harbaugh and Michigan, which lost in Salt Lake City. The Utes have a big-time coach in Kyle Whittingham and a strong, physical defense. They also have a very capable starting QB in 6-foot-7 senior Travis Wilson. Utah is definitely reaping the benefit of Power 5 Conference membership and is a threat to win the Pac-12.\nSmith: I watched part of that Utah-Oregon game and I was stunned. From the game plan to the execution, it was an overwhelmingly strong performance against one of college football's top programs. I remember looking at Utah's defensive line and thinking, \"Wow, that looks like an SEC line.\" I mean, they're huge up front. So, yes, clearly Utah has been able to recruit better players, which is one of the many benefits of being in a Power 5 conference.\nVergos: Utah's win was not that shocking; Utah has consistently competed with Oregon over the past five years, and now Oregon, without Chip Kelly and Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota, does not have that offensive spark. Being in the Power 5 gave Utah the ability and opportunity to recruit with top-tier teams in the country and they have taken advantage.\nEdmiston: I think it was less the result of the Utah-Oregon game than the manner of the beat down. Oregon's defense isn't very good, to be sure, so I think the jury has to remain out on Utah a bit longer. That said, Kyle Whittingham has built a terrific program and I do think the extra Pac-12 revenue has helped. They'll be in the mix nationally for a while now. And anytime you put up 62 in Eugene, putting together two trick plays on special teams that were fun to watch, you're going to get people's attention.\nMicheel: Let's face it. Oregon is not the team that they were with Chip Kelly. The teams in the Pac-12 have gained a lot of ground on the Ducks through recruiting and good coaching. Both are benefits of being in a Power 5 conference. Although it's taken some time, Utah is starting to make some headway utilizing those same benefits and look to be a contender for a Pac-12 title.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:35:03.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
