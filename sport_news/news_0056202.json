We’re proud of our kids.” \nBehind an explosive offense and a stout defense, the Demons (5-4, 3-2) positioned themselves in third place in District 3A-1 behind Heritage Hall and Cushing. \nWilliams said before the game Kingfisher was going to force the Demons to air it out offensively. \nThat’s fine. \nP-T threw the ball six times on their opening drive, completing four of those passes off the right arm of junior quarterback Autry Westfall. The 10-play, 80-yard drive ended with Westfall running it in from 7 yards out to give the Demons a 7-0 lead with 5:48 left in the first quarter. \nThe Demons’ score came right off the heels of a missed field goal attempt by the Kingfisher Yellowjackets. \nAs the game wore on, the running lanes for the Demons started opening up more and more. \nNot a problem, either. \nThe Demons would score a second time on a Chrys Bell 4-yard run with a 1:21 left in the second quarter, giving P-T a 14-0 lead at the break. \nPerkins-Tryon’s third touchdown came on the opening drive of the second half. Westfall punched it in from 3 yards out. A Westfall 51-yard run sparked the scoring drive a few plays earlier. \n“They couldn’t stop what we were doing,” Westfall said. \nWestfall finished the night passing for 62 yards, but on the ground is where he did his damage. He ran for 193 yards and three touchdowns. \n“He played a great game,” Williams said. “I think he had one bad read all night, one bad play all night.” \nWestfall, who has less than a half dozen starts under his belt, said he is getting more comfortable in his role as P-T’s starting quarterback in Williams’ offense. \nSenior running back Chrys Bell ran for 146 yards on 17 carries, scoring twice. \n“He’s kind of saved us, to be honest,” Williams said. “When Shawn (Crosby) went down (with injury), he has become the workhorse. When we need a yard, we give him the ball, and he usually gets it. He has been an outstanding player for us.” \nThe classic football mantra is to run to set up the pass. Well, P-T passed to set up the run. And it worked, to the tune of 429 yards rushing as a team. \n“Early on, they had more guys in the box,” Williams said. “We threw the ball, and I felt like we kept them off balance. Then they started covering our passing game, which opened up the run game. Both kinda complimented each other really well.” \nThe Perkins-Tryon defense played almost flawless. After allowing the Yellowjackets to get three first downs on their opening drive, the P-T defense didn’t allow a first down until 6:34 left in the third quarter. \n“Our defense has played well the past two weeks,” Williams said. “We are one play away from having two shutouts in a row. Really proud of those guys. They dropped a few balls early that might have gone for a score, but we did a good job of tackling in space.” \nIt was senior night for the Demons. Fourteen Demons and their families were honored for their time wearing the P-T black and white. And all fourteen were captains for the game. \nThe win kept a streak alive of having a winning record at McIlvain Field. Since 2006, the Demons have never had a losing record at the field named after a longtime coach. \nFor the Demons, there is no shame in being behind Cushing and Heritage Hall in district standings. \n“We were in third last year and it kind of bit us, but we want to finish as good as we can finish and that would be third place,” Williams said. \nFollow Kieran Steckley on Twitter at Kieran_Steckley for updates on local high school football.
