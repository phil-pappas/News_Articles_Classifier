Both teams made trades before the deadline to make their teams better before the playoffs. They battled down the stretch for the best record in the American League and the prize of home-field advantage. \nThe Royals were consistently strong across the season until they dealt with a September swoon. The Blue Jays got red-hot in the second half but stumbled enough in the waning days of the regular season to cede home-field advantage to Kansas City. \nThe Royals -- minus catcher Salvy Perez -- don't strike out and can play small ball. They had the least number of strike outs in the majors.\nBoom-boom goes Toronto's bats. They led the majors in home runs.\nJose Bautista's three-run jack in Game 5 against the Rangers was the back killer. He admired his handiwork before launching his bat dramatically skyward in a signature moment.\nRoyals designated hitter Kendrys Morales, who a strong candidate for comeback player of the year, had his own signature moment. His skip and arms wide run around the bases after hitting his own three-run home run Wednesday made highlight reels. \nTwo of the best pitchers in the series are well known to each other. \nToronto ace David Price and Royals closer Wade Davis were teammates in the minor and major leagues when they played for Tampa Bay. They became good friends, which included enduring an unsettling night in a haunted hotel.\nBoth teams have a rabid fan base who pack their stadium with blue. Toronto's stadium has a roof while the voters in 2006 rejected a rolling roof at the Truman Sports Complex. \nThere was dust ups between the two teams when they played earlier in the year including some dramatic games. Game 1 starter Edinson Volquez even called Josh Donaldson, who is likely to be named league MVP, a big baby. \nThe two teams played an epic ALCS in 1985. Toronto had home-field advantage but the Royals managed to win Game 7. They would go on to beat the St. Louis Cardinals in a seven-game World Series.\nRoyals manager Ned Yost said he is glad the Royals have home-field advantage in 2015.\n\"You know games like yesterday you feel the vibration from the cheering more than you hear it,\" he said. You gotta try and stop and make yourself hear it and look around. But it's fantastic.\"\nVolquez is looking forward to Friday night's game. He said he understands the emotions that propelled Bautista on Wednesday.\n\"We have got a lot of emotional guys here too and we are going to enjoy the game,\" he said. \"It's all about enjoy and have fun in the game.\"\nKCTV5's Michael Coleman contributed to this report. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
