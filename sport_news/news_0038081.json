(AP) - Reserve running back Akrum Wadley ran for 192 yards and tied a school record with four rushing touchdowns to carry No. 17 Iowa over No. 20 Northwestern 40-10 on Saturday. \nWith leading rusher Jordan Canzeri sidelined in the first quarter with an ankle injury, Wadley took over for Iowa (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten). The injury occurred following a short run when Northwestern linebacker Jaylen Prater landed on Canzeri, folding his ankle under a pile of players. \nWadley, who had only eight carries coming into the game, scored his third touchdown on a 2-yard run with 6:42 remaining in the third quarter, extending Iowa's lead to 23-10. His record-tying fourth scoring run, which followed a Northwestern fumble on the Wildcats ensuing drive, came on a 4-yard run that. \nMarshall Koehn added a 36-yard field goal before Derrick Mitchell scored on a 13-yard touchdown run with 7:55 left. More coverage SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise \nNorthwestern (5-2, 1-2) turned the ball over three times as the Wildcats lost for the second straight week after five consecutive victories. \nIowa led 16-10 at halftime after failing to extend its lead on the final play of the second quarter. C.J. Beathard drove the Hawkeyes to the Northwestern 16, but Koehn pushed a 34-yard field goal attempt wide left. \nNorthwestern struggled to find any rhythm offensively for much of the first half, but responded to a 16-point deficit with 10 straight points. \nRedshirt freshman Clayton Thorson, who was 17 for 35 passing for 125 yards with a touchdown and interception, connected with a wide open Christian Jones on a 4-yard touchdown pass with 6:18 remaining in the first half to get Northwestern to within 16-7. \nAfter Treveon Henry intercepted Beathard on Iowa's next drive, the Wildcats drove to the Hawkeyes 1-yard line, but had to settle for a Jack Mitchell 20-yard field goal to close to within 16-10. \nIowa built an early lead behind Wadley, who scored on runs of 35 and 4 yards, to provide the Hawkeyes with the double-digit lead. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:24:23.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
