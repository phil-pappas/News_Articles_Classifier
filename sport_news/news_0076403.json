If you keep the ball in play on the fairways, you can keep the score low.” \nDenmark’s Soren Kjeldsen started the day tied for the lead with Fitzpatrick but a 69 dropped him to third alongside Paraguay’s Fabrizio Zanotti, one shot behind the leaders. \nEngland’s Luke Donald carded the round of the day with a 65 to rise 28 places. The former top-ranked Donald is tied for fifth on 9 under and is looking for his first victory on the European Tour since the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in 2012. \n“I felt I was hitting the ball really well,” Donald said. “It is always nice to keep a five off the scorecard. I put myself in great positions. I’d love to go out there and shoot another round like this, I think that might be good enough. \n“I would just like to win any tournament to be honest, but it would be a little more special in the U.K.” \nBridgestone Invitational winner Shane Lowry is also in contention on the same score as Donald after shooting 69.
