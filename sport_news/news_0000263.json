Defending on this play are Daniel Ingram (4) and Greg Huebner. \nWEST MILFORD - The Lakeland and West Milford boys' soccer teams have had similar seasons, losing more games than they won and, at times, having problems scoring goals. \nOn Tuesday, against West Milford, Lakeland was the more opportunistic team on offense and played solid on defense. That combination translated into a 2-1 victory. Buy this photo \n\"Our defense didn't bend, didn't break,\" said winning coach Don Peterfriend, who noted that three of his back-liners are underclassmen. \nThe Lancer defense turned away all but one of the Highlanders' attacks, refusing to allow West Milford's attackers to split the seams in Lakeland's back line. \nOn offense, the Lancers scored their two goals within about 12 minutes spanning the first and second halves, taking a commanding 2-0 lead. \nLancer Matt Pierce recorded a goal and assisted on James Holm's score that came with about seven minutes left in the first half. Holm found himself unmarked during a Lancer counterattack. \nPierce netted what proved to be the clincher about two and a half minutes into the second half, again on a Highlander defensive lapse. \nLakeland goalie Josh Schaffer was solid in net, stopping several of West Milford's quality scoring chances in the opening half of play. \nThe Highlanders' response to Lakeland's goals came about five minutes into the second half when forward Ian Barrett headed a beautiful pass from Eric Gangi past Shaffer. \nLakeland's defense, however, was able to withstand a furious Highlander onslaught in the final 30-minutes. \n\"They controlled the flow of the game from the back,\" said Peterfriend of his defense. \n\"Two (goals) for us is a lot,\" he commented, noting that his team is starting to play well as the state tournament looms on the horizon. \"Hopefully we'll get to the state tournament and see what happens.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:45:48.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
