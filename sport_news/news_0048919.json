They face a game where their season will either end in numbing disappointment or proceed with renewed hope toward the ultimate prize. For the decisive Game 5 of the NLDS on Thursday against the Dodgers, from a staff of stunningly talented arms, the Mets rest their hopes with Jacob deGrom.\nNo biggie, said deGrom. He has been in pressure-filled spots before.\nHey, he pitched in the Subway Series. You go through Yankees-Mets, taking on an all-or-nothing playoff game is cake.\n“I think my debut [last season] being in the Subway Series against the Yankees, that was a pretty big stage for me. That was definitely one of the biggest games I’ve ever pitched,” said deGrom, who had a pretty fair playoff coming-out party too, stopping the Dodgers with 13 strikeouts, tying the Mets postseason record, in seven shutout innings in winning Game 1 Friday.\n“The All-Star Game this year has helped me, and having the home opener at Citi Field helped me also,” deGrom said. \nSo facing Zack Greinke, who won NLDS Game 2, seems like another game for deGrom. He doesn’t look at this as pitching for the Mets’ life in Game 5. He looks at it as going to work on Thursday.\n“I try to block everything out once I get on the field. Kind of the nerves go away, and it’s the same game we’ve been playing all year,” said deGrom, who followed up his Rookie of the Year campaign by going 14-8 with a 2.54 ERA. “Just try to take it one pitch at a time and make the best pitch I can. If I do give up a hit or something, so what?”\nUh, oh. Double. Bummer.\nDeGrom’s body of work made him an easy choice to start the series and be the guy to go for the Game 5 kill for Terry Collins, who said he will have both Noah Syndergaard and Matt Harvey on bullpen call if necessary.\n“When we were getting ready for the postseason … we felt that he was pitching the best of anybody, and that’s nothing to take anything away from Noah, how he was throwing or Harv. We just thought this guy was pitching best,” Collins said. “So if anybody was going to pitch two games in the series for us, it would be Jacob deGrom.”\nThe Dodgers saw more than they wanted to in the series opener. They realize what is ahead.\n“We know we got a huge mountain still to climb with an amazing starting pitcher coming against us,” catcher A.J. Ellis said.\nBut Don Mattingly’s guys have a stud on their side in Greinke, who outdueled Syndergaard in Game 2.\n“Both have amazing fastballs, and I just think deGrom might have a little more location [than Syndergaard],” Greinke said.\nAnd deGrom might be better — or at least around longer — this time. He picked up a few things in Game 1.\n“The fourth or fifth inning, I really started feeling good. Early on my pitch count was getting up, and once I noticed that, I was just trying to get quick outs, trying to go away from the strikeouts,” deGrom said. “I think that will be my game plan going into this game.” \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under jacob degrom ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  zack greinke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:30:26.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
