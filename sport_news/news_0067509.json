If Rossi finishes second, the Italian will need Lorenzo to be outside the top 10. \nLorenzo had earlier crashed for only the third time in 2015 during the fourth practice session, but was unhurt and able to use his second bike until his first was repaired. \nBritain's Cal Crutchlow (LCR Honda) is fifth on the grid ahead of Ducati Team's Andrea Iannone .
