It’s when preparation meets opportunity and we made some plays at the end.” \nRiverheads was stymied most of the night by the Gap defense, which stopped the Red Pride five times on fourth down and recovered a fumble on the first drive of the game. \nGap had an 8-7 lead at the half, then went up 14-7 on the first drive of the third quarter. The 13-play, 75-yard drive was capped by a 3-yard run by fullback David Mullins, who also scored the Bison’s first TD in the first half. The two-point try failed, leaving the score at 14-7. \nThen midway through the fourth quarter, Riverheads started to make things happen. \nA punt by Ridge Stokes pinned Gap inside its 15 and a sack by Hunter Allen on third down forced a punt that Riverheads downed at the Gap 44. \nTwo plays later, Schaefer went through the right side and outsprinted the Bison defense for a 42-yard touchdown run. Tristan Robson’s PAT kick tied it at 14-14. with 5:07 left. \n“That’s the nature of the beast when you’re playing Riverheads,” Gap coach Andy Cline said. “We kept them under control for a good portion of the game, then, all of a sudden, they just kind of pop one. If you’re out of place or miss an assignment, they can hurt you.” \nThe Bison, who had success through the air despite the windy, wet conditions, tried a pass on the first play of the ensuing series, but that’s when Smith made a leaping interception and returned it to the Buffalo Gap 45. \n“Tyler made a great read on that ball.” Casto said. “He got a good line on it and made the play.” \nFrom there, quarterback Garrett Campbell guided his team to the end zone. Schaefer carried eight times on the drive for 26 yards before Campbell went over from the Gap 1 on fourth-and-goal with 1:01 left in the game. \nBut the Bison weren’t finished yet. \nQuarterback Lucas Wheeler hit Troy Hodge for 30 yards to get to the Riverheads 40. After two incomplete passes, a pass interference on the Gladiators brought to the 30, but the drive stalled thanks to a sack by Taz Miller, and Landon Diehl picked of a desperation as the clocked expired. \n“The kids played with their hearts tonight,” Cline said. “For us to come in here and battle and have a chance at the end is huge. They really wanted to win this game, and they thought they were going to. That’s a testament to how far they’ve come.” \nThe Gladiators drew first blood on their second series after stopping Gap on a fourth down at their 34. Three plays later, Harrison Schaefer broke loose around right end for a 60-yard TD run. \nBut the Bison struck right back with an impressive 11-play, 80-yard drive. \nQuarterback Lucas Wheeler keyed the drive with a pair of clutch passes — a 12-yarder to Charles Weatherman and a 40-yarder to Troy Hodge that set up David Mullins’s 2-yard TD run. Wheeler then hit Dylan Thompson on the two-point conversion to make it 8-7 Bison. \nMullins was the workhorse on the drive, carrying eight times for 16- hard-fought yards. \nThe Bison kept the Gladiators out of the end zone twice in the second quarter, stopping them on fourth down at the Gap 23 and at the Bison 10 at the end of the half. \nBUFFALO GAP 8 0 6 0 — 14 \nRIVERHEADS 7 0 0 14 — 21 \nFirst Quarter \nR — Schaefer 40 run (Robson kick) \nB – Mullins 2 run (Thompson pass from Wheeler) \nThird Quarter \nB – Mullins 3 run (Pass failed) \nFourth Quarter \nSchaefer 42 run (Robson kick) Buy Photo Buffalo Gap's quarterback Lucas Wheeler lines up a pass before completing a two-point conversion to put the team one point ahead of Riverheads during their football game on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015.
