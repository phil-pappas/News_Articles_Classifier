Here are five thoughts from SMU's loss:\n1. Quick start, poor consistency. SMU came strong out of the gate, driving for touchdowns of 82 yards, 75 yards and 70 yards over the first quarter and a half to take a 21-14 lead. The Mustangs then allowed Houston to score 35 straight points to take a 49-21 lead late in the fourth. SMU will need to use this as a growth experience to keep its foot on the gas for four quarters. Some of this will need to come with increased talent on the roster.\n2. Strong performance from Matt Davis. The junior quarterback had a strong day both on the ground and through the air, combining for 274 yards and four all-purpose touchdowns on the day. His 248 yards led the game in passing, but he could not pull the Mustangs away down the stretch. Davis is showing consistent development each week, but the players around him need to step up. Only one running back finished with over 52 yards rushing.\n3. Inability to stop Greg Ward Jr. Houston quarterback Greg Ward Jr. is a true dual-threat and proved it against the Mustangs on Thursday night. The junior threw for 243 yards on 16-for-18 passing and added 82 yards on the ground and four touchdowns. Ward is now tied with LSU running back Leonard Fournette for most rushing touchdowns this season. SMU will need to find a way to stop some of the top stars it faces.\n4. Key turnovers. From a statistical standpoint, SMU kept up with Houston. The Mustangs were only outgained 467 to 399 yards and earned 21 first downs to 23 for Houston. However, the Mustangs fumbled the ball four times and lost it three of the times. With a porous defense on the sideline, SMU needs to place a premium on holding onto the ball if they want to stay in games. These fumbles led to two touchdowns at the end of the first half which gave Houston a lead it would never surrender.\n5. Young rivalry. SMU might be 1-5, but the Mustangs are a team on the rise under head coach Chad Morris. On the other sideline, new Houston coach Tom Herman is changing the game too. Both of these coaches are young, offensive-minded stars who are pushing their in-state programs to the next level. It will be interesting to see these two coaches grow across from each other over the next couple years.\nHouston 49, SMU 28: Complete coverage\nClick here to visit the Mustangs page\nNichols: Mistakes plague SMU in 49-28 loss to UH; Cougars rush for 7 TDs\nSMU quick hits: Mustangs' offense improves on third down; WR's homecoming a success\nNational reaction: Lack of defense in SMU-Houston game was 'laughable'\nPhotos: Mistakes doom SMU in 49-28 loss to UH\nFive thoughts from the SMU Mustang's 49-28 loss to the Houston Cougars\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/five-thoughts-smus-49-28-loss-houston", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/10/09/photos-mistakes-doom-smu-49-28-loss-uh", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/smu-mustangs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/smu-quick-hits-mustangs-offense-improves-third-wrs-homecoming-success", "https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/nichols-mistakes-plague-smu-49-28-loss-uh-cougars-rush-7-tds", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/national-reaction-lack-defense-smu-houston-game-laughable"], "published": "2015-10-09T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:03:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
