Yet it was another substitute, Blackburn's O'Sullivan, who almost had a bigger impact with a shot that looped off Richard Keogh and into Carson's hands after the keeper had already committed to the shot.Neither side could produce a grandstand finish, though, and Ben Marshall's attempt into the side netting with eight minutes remaining was the last effort of note.
