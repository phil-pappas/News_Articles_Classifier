It’s already the most polarising.\nBautista capped off one of the most incredible innings in baseball history when he blasted a three-run homer in the seventh inning to help the Toronto Blue Jays defeat Texas in the American League Division series.\nThe Dominican outfielder’s reaction captured the theatre of the moment perfectly, sending pundits and fans into a frenzy on social media and kids across the globe outside to perfect their own bat flip.\nJose Bautista throws his bat up in the air after he hits a three-run home run. Source: AFP\nBut not everyone was impressed, with Rangers pitcher Sam Dyson labelling Bautista’s actions disrespectful.\n“Jose needs to calm that down, just kind of respect the game a little more,” said Dyson, who surrendered the homer then clashed with Edwin Encarnacion afterwards, clearing both benches.\n“He’s a huge role model for the younger generation that’s coming up playing this game, and I mean he’s doing stuff that kids do in Wiffle ball games and backyard baseball.\n“It shouldn’t be done.”\nIn a country that’s arguably a world leader in overzealous sporting celebrations, it’s hard to imagine a bat toss causing such a fuss.\nBut baseball — like cricket — is a game with a rich history and roots as a gentleman’s game and Bautista’s celebration has reopened a debate over the balance between respecting tradition and modernising the sport.\nMaybe I&apos;m old school, but the bat flip phenomena is a pretty good indication of how stupid and disrespectful our society has become\n— McGeeTriples (@McGeeTriples) October 15, 2015 I Don&apos;t understand why Bautistas bat flip is being glorified and hyped? That&apos;s disrespectful and classless. Great example to young fans.\n— William Austin Boren (@WillBoren) October 15, 2015 Keep seeing gifs of the Bautista bat flip, definitely epic. Disrespectful but didn&apos;t care a lick. Great stuff. 😱\n— Jason Vega (@VegaJason) October 15, 2015 Seriously Bautista&apos;s bat flip was so disrespectful. I don&apos;t care how excited you are about a home run, that&apos;s extremely disrespectful.\n— Khaleesi (@moemoneyy_21) October 14, 2015 While the Rangers’ sentiments were shared by many fans on twitter, media opinion weighed heavily in favour of Bautista’s celebration, with many welcoming the sport’s shift towards the flamoyabnce and emotion seen more commonly in the NBA and NFL.\nThe MLB itself didn’t appear to take issue with the bat flip, sharing this video on twitter:\nWho flipped it better? #OwnOctober https://t.co/jVXRdGKdvF\n— MLB (@MLB) October 15, 2015 Nate Scott, writing for For The Win , said it was ”high time we embraced the bat flip”.\n“Bat flipping is a no-no in the baseball world, because It violates The Spirit of the Game and Isn’t Part Of Baseball and Get Off My Lawn and whatever else,” Scott wrote.\n“As someone with no rooting interest in the Rangers or Blue Jays, and has very little in the way of caring about its Unwritten Rules, I can earnestly say that I thought the bat flip was awesome, and I hope Bautista does it over and over again for long into this postseason.”\nBlue Jay's hilarious post win interview 1:10 MLB: Toronto infielder Munenori Kawasaki has delivered another hilarious interview following the Blue Jays' win over the Rangers.\nOctober 15th 2015 5 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Scott pointed out how a culture of animated celebrations in the NBA has helped cultivate its stars and the MLB needed to adopt the same mentality.\n“While traditionalists of the game can argue that the bat flip is a sign of the times, that it’s un-classy and me-first, it’s clear that Major League Baseball itself is turning the corner.\n“The league understands how desperately it needs stars, and stars need to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack.\nDon&apos;t like the Jose Bautista Great Bat Flip? Get over it. It was fantastic Performance Art.\n— Bob Ryan (@GlobeBobRyan) October 15, 2015 Andrew Key, writing for the New York Times , said baseball had reached a “flipping point”.\n“Times change, and signs today indicate that the league stands poised to enter a golden age of celebratory antics,” Key wrote.\n“If so, bat flip buffs might one day look back upon the league’s playoff games this week as a symbolic starting point.”\nBarry Svrluga, writing for the Washington Post , described Bautista’s home run reaction as “a demonstration of the electricity coursing through a moment when a game and season were on the line”\n“When human history is recounted, there will be the bat flip Bautista delivered Wednesday, and there will be all other bat flips, bowing in its presence,” Svrluga said.\nJose Bautista hits a three-run home run in the seventh inning against the Texas Rangers. Source: AFP\n“Filled with rage. Dashed with showmanship. Dripping with significance. The ball went out to left, a three-run shot that turned a tie game into what became a 6-3 Toronto victory that decided the series.\n“Bautista’s bat remained in his left hand until he tossed it high. Rogers Centre about lost its roof.”\nTime’s Sean Gregory described the bat-flipping criticism as ridiculous.\n“Guess what: competitive athletes get caught up in moment,” he wrote.\n“When they do something amazing in the face of unbearable tension, instinct tells them to let loose.\n“In basketball, how many times have we seen LeBron James and other starts pound their chests, or howl, after making a big play? Football players dance after reaching the end zone. Soccer players, on all ages, airplane around the field after scoring a goal. And this is fine. They’re happy, they should celebrate. Sports are supposed to be fun.\n“So bravo, Jose Bautista. And if a Little Leaguer wants to imitate him? Good for you too. The kids will be all right. Flip those bats. You deserve it.”\nBautista’s celebration even inspired a send-up from Chicago Cubs’ Anthony Rizzo in training:\n. @ARizzo44 ’s got jokes. #BatFlip https://t.co/HOo7vqWMab\n— MLB (@MLB) October 15, 2015 During an on field interview after the game, Bautista told Fox Sports he didn’t mean any disrespect.\n“Whatever I do, anything like that, and I certainly didn’t plan it. It was just the moment,” he said.\nThe Blue Jays begin the American League Championship series against Kansas City on Saturday.\nOriginally published as ‘A flipping point for baseball’", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MLB/status/654451793674416128", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/747ecaea313ba6e4b344b1f8f2d2587a", "https://twitter.com/WillBoren/status/654501068009660416", "https://twitter.com/moemoneyy_21/status/654441759754158081", "https://twitter.com/McGeeTriples/status/654472368451006464", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/sports/baseball/bat-flip-bautista-blue-jays.html", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/523fbd56f5cd0690b25a9178bf287dee", "https://t.co/jVXRdGKdvF", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/OwnOctober?src=hash", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/85584c06d824d0fd511579ec5d4834fa", "https://twitter.com/VegaJason/status/654446728578383872", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F15%2FDVU_151015_MLB_BAUTISTAS_3_RUN_HOMER_PKG.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/jose-bautistas-bat-flip-was-amazing-and-should-be-celebrated", "https://twitter.com/MLB/status/654750887131222017", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://time.com/4074336/jose-bautista-bat-flip-baseball/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BatFlip?src=hash", "https://t.co/HOo7vqWMab", "https://twitter.com/GlobeBobRyan/status/654617845557424128", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F15%2FDVU_151015_MLB_KAWASAKI_FUNN_INTERVIEW_PKG.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/us-sports/jose-bautistas-bat-toss-after-hitting-winning-home-run-for-toronto-blue-jays-causes-a-stir-in-us-sport/story-e6frf6ju-1227571376422", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/10/15/bautista-bat-flip-one-for-ages/FgIWeqKD4Rd9TYUoX5orFJ/story.html", "https://twitter.com/ARizzo44", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:48:35.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
