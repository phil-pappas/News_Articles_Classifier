He had been hospitalized nearly two weeks due to a collapsed lung. There is no word on a timetable to return. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:31:20.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
