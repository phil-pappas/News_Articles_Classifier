But the Red Devils also have a consistent backbone in the form of three seniors, all of whom have played doubles for the past two seasons. \nJacob Weiss and Ross Doughty have been Richmond's No. 1 doubles duo for two regional championships, while fellow senior Daniel Jones has teamed with Justin Gibbel at No. 2 for the same amount of time. \nAlong with their contributions on the court — which have helped the Devils win sectional and regional titles on the way to a 21-2 record and Saturday's semistate showdown with third-ranked Park Tudor at Center Grove — Weiss, Doughty and Jones have also given Richmond solid senior leadership throughout the season. \n\"They've all contributed a lot to the program. All three are really good kids and we're going to be sad to see them leave,\" Hollingsworth said. \"It's going to be hard to fill their shoes.\" \nWeiss and Doughty had the clinching team point in Wednesday's 5-0 sweep of New Castle for Richmond's 18th overall regional championship. It was a repeat performance for the pair: they also clinched last year's 3-2 win over Batesville in the same round, on the same courts. \nPairing up at doubles was no problem for Weiss and Doughty. \n\"We've been good friends since we met before preschool. I've known him my whole life,\" Doughty said. \nAdded Weiss: \"It's a really big part of how you play — chemistry, and you know how each other works.\" \nJones, too, credits chemistry in doubles success. He and Gibbel helped send Richmond into semistate with momentum with their win on Wednesday. \n\"Knowing your partner that well, it just helps the game flow so much better,\" Jones said. \"You know their strengths, you know their weaknesses and you can compensate for it.\" \nRichmond ended an eight-year regional drought a year ago, and this year's back-to-back championships mark the first time consecutive crowns have been won by the Red Devils since their 11-year reign from 1983-93. \nSix of seven Red Devils in this year's lineup — all four at doubles and singles players Eric Hollingsworth and Logan Mayer — returned from last year's team. \nThat's part of the consistency that's helped Richmond continue to win titles. \n\"I really didn't have to worry about moving any of the doubles spots around. I kind of assumed they would be the same, and it worked out that way,\" Randy Hollingsworth said. \"Doubles is huge because you get used to playing with the same partner, and those guys have been able to play with the same partner for two years, so they knew each other pretty well. \n\"They come to practice every day. They work hard, they stay out of trouble and they do what they're supposed to do. You can't ask for anything more than that. ... I couldn't be prouder of the way they've stuck with it. You go through the bad times, too, but we've had a lot of good times. It's been fun.\" \nFreshman Ryan Hollingsworth was the newcomer to Richmond's team this year, and the Red Devils have benefited from his steady play at No. 3 singles. \nHollingsworth has benefited from the encouragement of the veteran players, including Richmond's trio of seniors. \n\"They're always great at leadership and helping me get more confident,\" Ryan Hollingsworth said. \nPark Tudor earned its semistate spot after the Panthers defeated the host team, also state-ranked, to win the Avon Regional on Wednesday. The Richmond-Park Tudor match starts at noon. Perry Meridian will play Terre Haute South in the other semistate match at Center Grove. \nThe Red Devils have extra time to prepare this year, unlike their last trip to Center Grove for semistate. Rain pushed the 2014 regional final back to Saturday morning, and Richmond immediately headed for an afternoon match at Center Grove after defeating Batesville in the regional final. RHS then fell to Center Grove 5-0. \n\"It gives us a great chance to prepare. We know what we have to work on,\" Jones said. \"We're going to go in ready.\" \nThe Richmond-Park Tudor winner moves on to the state finals Oct. 16-17. The quarterfinal rounds are at Carmel and Center Grove on Oct. 16 while the semifinals and championship match are Oct. 17 at North Central. \n\"It's nice. One last ride,\" Weiss said. \"You get to enjoy it and keep trying to go as far as you can.\" \nJosh Chapin: (765) 973-4463 jchapin@pal-item.com or twitter.com/JoshChapinPI Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1LkFUZV TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:20:42.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
