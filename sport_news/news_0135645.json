We wish him well in the future.\" \nVilla's Under-21 boss Kevin MacDonald has been placed in caretaker charge and is expected to manage the side for Wednesday's Capital One Cup trip to Southampton as well as next Monday's league game at Tottenham. \nMacDonald was previously caretaker boss in 2010 after Martin O'Neill quit and was brought back to the club by Sherwood in February after a coaching spell at Nottingham Forest.
