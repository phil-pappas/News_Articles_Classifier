Phil (Jackson) was a little more isolated from the players than that. Because as a player I enjoyed my relationship with Coach Scott, I try to do that when I'm out here with these guys.\" Advertisement \nWalton continues to serve as the interim head coach for the defending champions during a three-game trip to Southern California. Steve Kerr travel with the team, but will not run practices yet, according to Walton. \n\"I don't think he wants to do that until he's ready to come back fully because it's just more of a distraction for all the players if he's in and out running practice one day and not the next day,\" Walton said. \"So I think he's just kind of traveling with us, but he's still going to kind of keep his distance a little bit.\" \nThe Warriors will be missing three regular starters against the Lakers. \nKlay Thompson will not be at the game and did not practice Friday while he was traveling to the Bahamas for family funeral services. The Warriors expect him to rejoin the team later on this trip. \nAndrew Bogut will not play after suffering a broken nose in Thursday's preseason win against the Houston Rockets. He is expected to undergo minor surgery to reset his nose after the swelling decreases. \nHarrison Barnes practiced Friday, but was held out of 5-on-0 drills and will miss a second consecutive game because of a bone bruise in his right knee. \nThe Warriors will also be missing guard Jarell Eddie, who did not travel after suffering a sprained right ankle against the Rockets. Chris Babb and Ian Clark are the remaining guards with non-guaranteed contracts on the trip. \nKobe Bryant will not play for the Lakers due to precautionary reasons after experiencing soreness in a left leg muscle, Scott told reporters. \nWalton said he was leaning toward starting Festus Ezeli in place of Bogut after he came off the bench and had five blocked shots against the Rockets. \n\"Every time I block a shot, I talk a little smack too, so I like blocking shots,\" Ezeli said, laughing. \nWalton said Ezeli has improved on making reads, passing and posting. \n\"His confidence is high right now,\" Walton said. \"He wants to show everyone what he can do now. For us as a staff, sometimes we've got to remind him, 'Let it come to you. We now know what you can do.' \n\"We feel confident with the ball down there in his hands.\" For more on the Warriors, see the Inside the Warriors blog at www.ibabuzz.com/warriors .
