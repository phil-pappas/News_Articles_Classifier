And that all starts with team defense, he said.\n\"Defend with passion. We've been working hard at that, blocking shots and getting people in the right places,\" he said when asked what the team was working on after a 6-3 loss in Colorado . \"I didn't fully expect us to be 100 percent solid, we have some players who aren't quite up and running, but you have a responsibility to be in a certain place on the ice, to take away a certain lane, and you just have to do your job. We had some missed assignments, and those assignments hurt us.\"\nThere were several breakdowns on the game-winning goal, for example, when Colorado's John Mitchell was left all alone in the slot. The Stars had three layers of defense to stop the pass or have a stick on Mitchell. They had breakdowns in all three layers from defenders losing puck battles, to defenders not blocking a passing lane, to forwards not picking up Mitchell.\n\"I was embarrassed the way we defended, some of our neutral zone stuff, missed assignments,\" Ruff said. \"We had five guys deep in the zone when they scored the game- winning goal. That was unacceptable for what we've gone through and tried to play defensively.\"\nWhile the Edmonton Oilers have scored just one goal this season in two road losses to St. Louis and Nashville, Tuesday's opponent is a great challenge for the Stars. They must stay disciplined against a young, speedy team.\nRuff looked to be juggling lines again Monday and will likely give Kari Lehtonen his first start of the season. While the head coach doesn't confirm his intent, he also doesn't mind dropping plenty of clues in practice.\nHe ran this lineup Monday:\nJamie Benn-Tyler Seguin-Patrick Eaves\nAntoine Roussel-Jason Spezza-Patrick Sharp\nMattias Janmark-Cody Eakin-Ales Hemsky\nTravis Moen-Vernon Fiddler-Val Nichushkin/Colton Sceviour\nAlex Goligoski-John Klingberg\nJohnny Oduya-Jason Demers\nJyrki Jokipakka-Jordie Benn\nPatrik Nemeth-Jamie Oleksiak\n\"There have been a lot of discussions,\" Ruff said with a smile when asked about possible changes. \"But I am just not up to discussing them (with the media).\"\nAles Hemsky will be going against his old team, the Oilers. Hemsky leads the Stars in scoring with a goal and two assists, but is playing on a line with rookie Mattias Janmark and is averaging only 13:32 in ice time. Ruff said he likes Hemsky's game and does not rule out playing that line more.\n\"If that line is playing better than A and B, then that line is going to be the line,\" Ruff said. \"I think that competition for ice time can easily be sorted out by a coach if he sees that line going that well.\"\nRuff started Janmark and Hemsky all three periods in Colorado. Janmark scored 20 seconds in Saturday. He scored 1:39 into Thursday's game. Asked if liked what he saw, Ruff joked: \"I think Janmark is a very effective starter.\"\nThe potential line changes could change the dynamic of the team. Seguin moves back to center after playing right wing most of the first two game,while Eakin moves down the lineup from the top line. The presence of Eakin, who usually plays about 18 minutes a night, creates opportunity for Hemsky and Janmark, who is moving to wing. Antoine Roussel comes off that line and provides some grit for the second line. Roussel leads the team in SAT (shot differential at even strength) at plus-14 this season.\nEaves then gets a chance to be a strong defensive presence with a little grit on the top line.\nThe fourth line could be interesting. Valeri Nichushkin, who started on the second line with Spezza, has looked out of sorts, Ruff said.\n\"Val has really been struggling. I've been trying to help him by shifting him around,\" Ruff said. \"He had some struggles early in camp on right wing, so I put him on left, and he doesn't seem real comfortable at left right now. His game, everything has got to get a little bit quicker.\"\nRuff said he could reduce his minutes or even scratch Nichushkin.\n\"There's two ways to get through it _ you either sit on the outside and take a look, and sometimes that helps you, or sometimes players can play through it.\"\nRuff said Nichushkin isn't thinking fast enough when trying to make plays.\n\"There's so little time,\" Ruff said. \"There's some situations where you've got to know you've got no time. There are times when I think he thinks he should be able to get up and go, but there's no get-up-and-go room.\"\nKari Lehtonen came off at his normal time after about an hour of practice, while Antti Niemi stayed on for an extra 45 minutes. That usually means Lehtonen will start. Lehtonen had a hard preseason and had a hard end to last season. He allowed six goals on 19 shots in a 7-5 loss to St. Louis April 3. Jhonas Enroth then finished out the schedule, winning the final four games. Niemi started the first two games of this season.\nAsked if he looks back on last season or remembers his last game, Lehtonen said: \"I don't look back much. I'm excited to start this season, that's what I'm looking forward to.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeHeika", "external_links": ["http://video.stars.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=1092&id=844976&lang=en", "https://twitter.com/MikeHeika"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:03:53.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
