David Vitter’s latest endorsement comes from right at home. In the TV commercial, his wife, Wendy, talks about Vitter’s record while the ad shows pictures of their children.\n“What we’ve seen is David Vitter’s credibility with female voters. His electability is on the line, and his wife is out front to try and correct some of that,”Sherman said.\nAccording to our FOX 8 / Raycom Media poll, 40 percent of women have a \"not very favorable\" opinion of Vitter. But it gets worse. When you focus on percentages among working women, 60 percent of working women have a \"somewhat or not very favorable\" opinion of Vitter.\n“This is a stunning number; although, not very surprising considering the serious sin a lot of Vitter’s opponents have been attacking. Until he addresses that issue, there’s a large portion of this electorate - particularly female voters - that aren’t going to be forgiving,” Sherman said.\nJust after the Wendy Vitter commercial began airing, a new anti-Vitter ad surfaced. In this ad, a woman says the future needs to be in safer, more trustful hands.\n“His opponents are pouncing on that. Remember Stormy Daniels the last time he ran for U.S. Senate? This is a group of opponents who have seen David Vitter’s weakness. It’s his serious sin. It’s an issue with women voters in particular,” Sherman said.\nSherman says it’s clear, these commercials are all about the female vote - something that Vitter is clearly struggling to hold on to.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
