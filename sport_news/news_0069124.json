Comment Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 3:04 PM Updated at 8:22 PM Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 3:04 PM Updated at 8:22 PM • East Bridgewater girls soccer team basks in glory EAST BRIDGEWATER - School officials in East Bridgewater are not saying why they have suddenly removed high school girls soccer coach Pam Ross, the 15-year veteran who led the team to its first state title a year ago. Superintendent Elizabeth Legault told the Enterprise Monday that Ross had been removed from the position, but didn’t give a reason beyond saying it was a “personnel matter.” Ross was replaced by Jen Lemoine, who was the coach of the junior varsity girls soccer team for East Bridgewater, according to the district’s athletic director. Ross remained an English teacher at the school Monday, despite having been removed as coach, Legault said. “She has spoken with the building principal, the athletic director and myself,” Legault said. “Everyone has been involved in the conversation.” On the heels of its Division 4 state championship, East Bridgewater girls soccer is a top-ranked team in the state this year, and is 12-1 this season. “The girls are having a great season this year. The district is having a good year, so we want to keep focused on that,” Legault said. Last season, East Bridgewater High School defeated Monson, 3-0, in the Division 4 state championship game on Nov. 23. On Monday, the East Bridgewater girls team was in Randolph to face the Blue Devils, in the first match since it was announced that Ross is no longer coach. But it wasn't the typical varsity East Bridgewater Vikings who took the field. Instead, it was a squad composed of nearly all junior varsity players from the school, with the exception of a couple of varsity players who came along for the match. East Bridgewater athletic director Tom Kenney, who attended the game in Randolph on Monday, said that the decision to swap his girls varsity soccer team with mostly junior varsity players was made earlier that day. However, the match still counted on the season record for the varsity East Bridgewater and Randolph girls soccer teams, Kennedy said. Kenney said the swap had \"nothing\" to do with the firing of Ross. Kenney, who formerly worked as athletic director in Brockton declined to comment on the firing of Ross as the head coach. Kenney called Monday’s game a \"gentleman's agreement\" with opposing Randolph athletic director Tony Price, who confirmed the agreement. The agreement was forged on Monday, he said. Kenney said the real reason for the swap was because the varsity East Bridgewater girls squad is a much more dominant team than that of Randolph. The goal of the decision was to have a competitive match, he said. The last time the Vikings varsity team played Randolph, the East Bridgewater girls won, 11-0, Kenney said.

The focus is always and continues to be the kids.” The match on Monday in Randolph was managed by interim East Bridgewater junior varsity girls soccer coach Abigail Glennon, who also declined to comment on the removal of Ross. Glennon is a math teacher at East Bridgewater High School, who formerly played soccer in North Attleboro. Former Randolph girls soccer coach Matt Tavares, who worked with the program for 20 years, said he was shocked by the removal of Ross as the coach of East Bridgewater. Tavares said he knows first-hand how good Ross was as a coach, from having faced her difficult teams throughout the years. “I am just as surprised as you are,” said Tavares, as he watched Monday’s match. “They were a very dominant team last year.” Just before the match, the coaches of the Randolph varsity girls soccer team were not even aware that they were facing a team composed of junior varsity players from East Bridgewater. They thought they were playing a varsity team. “I never knew it was like that,” said Ronald Joseph, assistant coach for the Randolph varsity girls team. The incident is not the first time a successful and popular coach has been removed from their position under the leadership of Legault, the East Bridgewater superintendent. In October 2014, Legault oversaw the controversial removal of football coach Justin Culligan while serving as the superintendent of the Whitehall Central School District in Whitehall, N.Y, according to local NBC-affiliate Channel 13 WNYT-TV. Culligan, who had served as the team’s coach for five years, was dismissed after the district’s Board of Education unanimously voted in favor of his removal following a brawl during a football game that season. Culligan would later state that he was told by the board in a letter that he was dismissed for “foul language,” an apparent violation of a zero-tolerance policy on coaches swearing at players that had been instituted by Legault before the beginning of the school year, WNYT-TV reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:41:06.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
