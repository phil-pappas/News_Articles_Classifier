Moments later, his heart stopped beating for nearly two minutes. \n\"Right when I got to first base...I (then) woke up behind the dugout,\" recalled Laudenslager. \nBy chance, a doctor was there and revived Colton before he was airlifted to a hospital. \nCBS 21 News met Colton shortly thereafter -- in August 2006 -- when the Harrisburg Senators minor league baseball team, after learning of Colton's ordeal, invited him to a game. \nNine years later, his father is still thanking the family's lucky stars. \n\"Pretty much everyday before I go to bed,\" said Kevin Laudenslager. \nHow about very lucky. \"Yes, especially since there are people who die from it,\" said Colton. \nThere's a medical term for what Colton experienced. Its called commotio cordis and boys and teenagers have died from similar blows to the heart. \nAnd Colton barely made it. \nYet the most fascinating part of Colton's miracle? It now comes into play nearly every day. \nUp to this point, he says he's encountered no side effects: no matter what he plays or how often he plays for head coach Brent Bell. \"We don't have a lot of one-way players,\" said Bell before a recent practice. \"Colton's pretty much on offense, defense and probably all of special teams.\" \nAnd Colton plans on remaining active. \n\"I want to do active duty...military,\" he said. \nHe loves his country. He loves his family. He loves his football. \nYup, that's little boy's heart checks out just fine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:41:54.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
