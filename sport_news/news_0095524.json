I am serving in merchant navy (foreign shipping) since 1997. For the past 18 years, I have been maintaining my NRI time. But in this financial year 2015-2016, I may not be able to complete my required NRI time. My queries are as follows: 1. If I have been maintaining my NRI time for the previous 10 years consecutively, am I exempted for next year without any penalty of tax? 2. Has CBDT imposed any income tax on NRIs whose income exceeded Rs 5 lakh or when he has deposited Rs 5 lakh at one time. I only have NRE account and there's no other income. — Ravi A. Your queries are replied as under: (a) In case you have been in India for a period amounting in all for 182 days or more in the financial year 2015-16, you will have to file your tax return in respect of income received or deemed to be received in India and income which accrues or arises or deemed to accrue or arise in India and pay tax on the such income. Since you expect to be in India for more than the specified number of days, it would be advisable to pay advance tax on 15th December and 15th March so as to avoid the payment of interest under Section 234B of the Act. However, you will be liable to pay interest under Section 234C of the Act (for non-payment of advance tax on 15th September, 2015). There would be no penalty in case the income-tax return is filed by July 31, 2016. (b) You will be liable to pay tax in respect of salary received from the shipping company for the financial year 2015-16. No tax is payable on the interest earned in NRE account. Q. I had retired as a professor on August 31, 2006, from CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar. At that time, the prevailing rate of gratuity was Rs 3.5 lakh —which was paid to me. Later, the pay scales were revised and were implemented w.e.f January 1, 2006, and the rate of gratuity was raised to Rs 10 lakh. The university deducted income tax at source. I had applied for refund and the I-T Department gave me refund. Now, the I-T Department has issued a notice to me for paying income tax on enhanced gratuity, i.e. Rs 6.5 lakh. They have issued notices only to those people who have retired before June 24, 2010. Kindly let me know whether the action of the I-T Department is genuine and am I supposed to pay income tax on enhanced gratuity? — Dr SK Garg A. The limit of Rs 10 lakh in respect of exempted gratuity was applicable for the persons retiring on or after May 24, 2010. The action of the Income-tax Department, therefore, in re-opening the assessment is correct as no refund should have been granted to you in respect of tax paid on gratuity received in the year 2006. Q. I am a government employee and already have NPS account. My employer deducts 10% from my salary in NPS scheme. As per new rules, we can invest additional Rs 50,000 in NPS Scheme. I want to know whether these 10% deductions made by employer can be part of this additional NPS and can I save Rs 1.50 lakh in other components under Section 80C? — Ajmer Singh A. Deduction in respect of contribution to pension scheme is allowable under Section 80CCD of the Income-tax Act 1961 (The Act). Section 80CCEof the Act provides that the amount of deduction under Section 80C, Section 80CCC of the Act (amount paid to effect or keep in force a contract for any annuity plan from an insurance company for receiving pension) and 80CCD of the Act shall not exceed Rs 1,50,000. Therefore, you cannot get an additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 under Section 80C of the Act.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:11:46.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
