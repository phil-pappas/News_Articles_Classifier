Frustration.\n“Yes, no question about it,’’ Coughlin said. “You can sense it in my voice.’’\nYes, you could sense it in the voice of the 69-year-old head coach. The Giants blew their first two games of this season despite holding double-digit leads in the fourth quarter. They reeled off three straight wins, seemingly evolving into a scrappy team able to keep things close. Then came Monday’s 27-7 loss to the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field, where the highlight of the night was the opening drive and the lowlight was pretty much everything that took place thereafter.\nThe Giants reverted, with three turnovers and 12 penalties, including several falling into the category of “Mindless.’’ It dropped the Giants to 3-3 and brought back those bad vibes from 2014, when a Week 6 loss in Philadelphia led into a Week 7 loss to the Cowboys, the first two notches in a seven-game losing streak.\nThe similarity to this season — next up, on cue, are the Cowboys — is eerie, coincidental or inconsequential. But it is real. And denial is no way to go through a season, even if it is tempting to do so.\n“I think we have to address it,’’ center Weston Richburg said. “We can’t act like it didn’t happen.’’\nNo, they cannot. Like it or not — you can be sure they don’t like it — the Giants of 2015 must confront the questions and conjecture that they are following a similar path that led to ruination one year ago.\n“That was last year,’’ Coughlin said, forcefully. “This is a new year. What am I worried about? I’m worried about getting our team ready for the Dallas Cowboys. Forget about last year. Last year was last year.’’\nWishing it away will not make it so. Coughlin may believe harping on last year’s downward spiral might be too much of a downer. He has to admit, at least deep down, that some of the similarities are striking. The Giants last season lost 27-0 in Philly. This year, the Eagles outscored the Giants 27-0 after the first five minutes.\n“Nowhere, not even close, the sky isn’t falling,’’ left guard Justin Pugh said. “I feel very confident the direction we’re headed in, the guys we got in this room.\n“Last year was totally different, we didn’t even sniff anything last year, any semblance of moving the ball. We have confidence going against this team again, it’s nothing like last year. We have everything we want still in front of us, we’re 3-3, we’re tied for first, we got a long way to go.’’\nThe Giants allowed nearly as many sacks in this game (three) than they did in the first five (four). They turned the ball over three times after only three giveaways in the first five games. An offense that confidently marched for the winning touchdown in the final seconds a week earlier against the 49ers came out with a splendid opening drive and didn’t score again.\nJust when trust was beginning to surround the Giants, they fell back on bad habits.\n“We had played our way into three wins, we had gotten ourselves into position we wanted to be in, we had created a big opportunity for our team,’’ Coughlin said. “I was confident our team was going to play hard and play in the same style we had been.\n“At the expense of anything else both hands have got to go on the ball. You just can’t be careless. You just can’t. Especially when you go into a game with the team leading the league in forced fumbles. I just shake my head sometimes.’’\nWith that, Coughlin pivoted.\n“But let’s not forget there’s a long way to go,’’ he said. “We are 3-3.’’\nJust like last year.\n  new york giants ,  tom coughlin ,  weston richburg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:01:48.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
