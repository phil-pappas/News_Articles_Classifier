And the reality of it is they came in here and kicked our tail. They beat us soundly. Badly. All of the above.\"\nThe Hokies (3-3, 1-1 ACC) are hoping for a more competitive game when they head down to play Miami (3-2, 0-1) in Saturday's critical Coastal Division clash.\nIn its last game, Virginia Tech turned things around for one week at least, bouncing back from a disappointing ACC opening loss to Pittsburgh by handling N.C. State 28-13 on Friday. That avoided a disastrous 0-2 start to league play.\n\"Our backs were to the wall and our coaches and players, I thought, did a tremendous job,\" Beamer said. \"I tell them that's when... coaching makes a difference. Anyone can coach when things are smooth, silky smooth and going well.\n\"But that's when you find out who the good coaches are is when it's a little rough and people are doubting you and not many good things are being said about you.\"\nMiami is coming off a 29-24 loss to Florida State and has gone into a funk after past setbacks against its state rival. The 'Canes are 2-6 following their last eight losses to the Seminoles, although one of those wins was a 30-12 beating of Virginia Tech in 2012.\nThe Hokies, meanwhile, know they have further to go. There was no word Monday about quarterback Michael Brewer's availability as he comes back from a broken collarbone. He'll meet with doctors this morning before any decision is made. The senior was able to practice last week but was not cleared to play in the game.\n\"He was much better, and we were able to get him out and get him more reps and have him practice a heck of a lot more than he has been practicing,\" offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler said. \"So it came down to basically a game-time decision, and he just wasn't ready to go out and play yet.\"\nBackup Brenden Motley has performed well in his absence. The junior's 10 touchdown passes are second in the ACC behind Clemson standout Deshaun Watson's 11, and his 1,213 yards of offense rank third.\n\"We've got two quarterbacks that can win a football game for us. That's the bottom line,\" Beamer said.\nThe order at running back is clearer, with redshirt freshman Travon McMillian slated to start after gaining 96 yards on a career-high 11 carries against N.C. State, sealing the win with a 59-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.\n\"He did a great job on Friday night and got hot and gave us something there toward the end of the game,\" running backs coach Shane Beamer said. \"He'll start, but again, so much of our offense is personnel driven.\"\nMcMillian and fullback Sam Rogers got all the running back carries last week, while J.C. Coleman (Oscar Smith High) and Trey Edmunds didn't get any, although Shane Beamer noted that both have had big roles in the past. Edmunds had four touchdown runs the last time the Hokies went to Miami in 2013.\n\"J.C. and Trey need to continue to have a role and will continue to have a role,\" Shane said. \"I think people are quick to forget the type of players and people they are.... They're team guys and we haven't just kicked them to the curb and forgotten about them.\"\nNote: Virginia Tech's Oct. 24 game at Lane Stadium against Duke will be a 3:30 p.m. kickoff and televised by ESPNU.\nVirginia Tech football Follow @AndyBitterVT\nMore Va.
