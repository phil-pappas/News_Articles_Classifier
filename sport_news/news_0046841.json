For the most part, I thought we played well. We’ll start to get it on the offensive end.”\nAll in all, it added up to a satisfying, albeit sloppy, win over the Kobe Bryant-led Lakers, which the Jazz and their fans appreciate regardless of it happening in the postseason, regular season or preseason.\n“I thought we settled in in the second half and made some plays defensively,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “We had some guys that looked like they were enjoying playing.”\nThat was especially the case in the second half when the defensive-minded Jazz erased the Lakers’ one-time lead of 13 and surfed a wave of momentum to an easy victory at the Stan Sheriff Center on the campus of the University of Hawaii.\n“The first half was kind of rough. We were missing assignments, missing a couple of shots,” Favors said. “In the second half, everybody got into a rhythm. Everybody got comfortable and relaxed a little bit more. We just played better.”\nWhile the Jazz’s big men were their usual stifling selves down low, an unexpected source provided a defensive lift in this game in front of a pro-Laker crowd of 10,300.\nThe 6-foot-1 Neto was a pest on defense in his debut, notching four steals to go with his six assists. Of all of the newcomers — a group that also included No. 12 pick Trey Lyles and German center Tibor Pleiss — the 23-year-old Brazilian had the biggest impact in this win.\n“I felt pretty good. I tried to do what coach say,” Neto said. “(Snyder) say, ‘Press the ball full court, make them feel uncomfortable.’ I did that. I hit some balls, and I get some steals.”\nNeto ended up playing 20 minutes behind Burke, who go the start and finished with 10 points and three assists.\nBecause of Exum’s knee surgery, which will keep the Aussie out all season, the point guard position is one of the biggest question marks for the Jazz this season. But Snyder liked what he saw in Game 1.\n“He’s taken pride in it. It’s something clearly that is a point of emphasis,” Snyder said, referring to Neto’s defensive thievery. “I thought Trey gave us that early in the game as well. If those two guys, if they can come in like that and kind of tag team and just compete on defense and make you feel them, that helps.”\nBurks missed all of his field-goal attempts, but he made at least three sensational passes, had three assists and grabbed four rebounds. It was his first game since his 2014-15 season was cut short due to a surgery-requiring knee injury last December.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/vwzkSHMoS7", "https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/650882903795191808", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlohaJazz?src=hash", "https://t.co/fpRiM9X7BI", "https://t.co/92GGV5r7Ui", "https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/650880057976598528", "http://t.co/nMNYU9ZeaG", "https://twitter.com/dfavors14", "https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/650881492017541120", "https://twitter.com/TreyMambaLyles", "https://t.co/G68BjLcuND", "https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/650864137933733888", "https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/650881675807850496"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:44:00.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
