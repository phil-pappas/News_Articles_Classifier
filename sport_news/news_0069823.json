Back in 1995, they'd be surprised at the Associated Press poll midway through the 2015 season.\nBaylor, which moved on to the Big 12 with Texas, Texas A&M and Texas Tech, is ranked second.\nTCU, left behind at the time (but joining the Big 12 in 2012 in the absence of A&M), is ranked third.\nAnd Houston, another program that had to seek out a new conference following the SWC's disbanding, cruised into the polls at No. 24 on Sunday.\nThe Cougars, under first-year coach Tom Herman, are ranked for the first time since the end of the 2011 season under then-coach Kevin Sumlin. UT and Tech aren't ranked, and Sumlin-led A&M, which bolted the Big 12 for the Southeastern Conference in 2012, is ninth for a second consecutive week.\nEven if the old SWC failed to live on, some of its original castoffs certainly have.\nCheck out the gallery to see the highs, lows, Quote: of the week and Heisman watch for week six of college football action.\nCOMING THIS WEEK\nHouston at Tulane, 8 p.m. Friday\nWest Virginia at Baylor, 11 a.m. Saturday\nTexas Southern at Mississippi Valley State, 2 p.m. Saturday\nAlabama at Texas A&M, 2:30 p.m. Saturday\nSam Houston State at Abilene Christian, 2:30 p.m. Saturday\nHouston Baptist at Nicholls State, 3 p.m. Saturday\nPrairie View A&M at Southern, 4 p.m. Saturday\nTCU at Iowa State, 6 p.m. Saturday\nLamar at Northwestern (La.)
