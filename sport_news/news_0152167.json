I’m going to enjoy this victory, tell some jokes, laugh and watch my players try to imitate me a little bit. When the sun rises, I’ll put my mind on Southern.” \nPrayers to the Jaguars \nThe Hornets have more than a week until they host the defending Southwestern Athletic Conference runner-up Southern (2-2, 2-0), but Jenkins’ post-game comments regarding the Jaguars transcended football. \nJenkins opened up the post-game press conference by sending prayers from the ASU program to Baton Rouge, La., for the quick recovery of junior wide receiver Devon Gales, who suffered a spinal injury during a Sept. 26 game at Georgia. \n“Our prayers go out to Coach (Dawson) Odums and the Southern University family,” Jenkins said. “If there’s anything ASU can do – we’re more than willing to help out.” \nRoad Jaguars \nASU won its third straight SWAC road game, dating back to a road victory at Grambling State last season. \nThe Hornets will play three games over the next 19 days, including a Thursday night game on Oct. 15 at Arkansas-Pine Bluff. \nDominating the series \nASU extended its winning streak over Texas Southern to five games. Of the quartet of games, only one – the 2011 contest – was decided by two touchdowns or less. The Hornets won that game, 43-29. \nThe Hornets have also won six of the last eight games against the Tigers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:09:01.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
