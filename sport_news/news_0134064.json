I just think Sam is a great athlete who can do really well in the union game (and) I hope he does. \n“I wish him all the best going forward and going into the future.” \nFolau, meanwhile, admits he is not 100 per cent heading into Saturday’s high-stakes Pool A clash with Wales at Twickenham. \nThe two-time John Eales medal winner rolled his ankle in the second half of Australia’s impressive win over England last week and had to pass a fitness test on Thursday to convince coaching staff he could play. \n“I had a couple of days off during the week just to make sure that everything was alright, and I had a bit of a run around yesterday with the guys and it felt pretty good, so I am very confident going into the game,” he said. \n“It’s not 100 per cent. For me, I am confident, otherwise I wouldn’t be strapping on the boots and going out there. \n“I am sure every player throughout the tournament gets niggling injuries, and you have got to try to overcome those the best you can. \n“I am definitely going into the game tomorrow, and that is the last thing on my mind.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:03:48.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
