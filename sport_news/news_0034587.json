Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. The Sonora Wildcats may be on a five-game win streak, but when they don’t do their homework, they have to pay the price. Wednesday’s price for players not studying enough game film on tonight’s opponent Summerville was 17 gassers, sprints there and back the width of Dunlavy Field. And by the looks, it wasn’t easy or anything resembling fun. Sweat poured off players and they all gasped for breath during breaks between the sprints. “Normally we do a little lighter conditioning on Wednesday’s than that, but since there were a lot of guys that did not meet the minimum criteria for watching film this week, we ran some extra gassers,” said Wildcat head coach Bryan Craig. “We only require them a minimum of an hour and some of our kids have AP classes and have homework like crazy, so they can do it anytime from Saturday until Tuesday.” The skill positions get 23 seconds, the beefier linemen get a little more time, 3 extra seconds. “It’s long … tedious … and it’s not extremely fun,” said Sonora junior offensive lineman/linebacker Killian Rosko, who pushed hard on the final sprint to finish well ahead of his group. “But it’s all mental. If you can push your body past it, you’ll be fine. I always try to be the first guy and I’m always gonna give it my best. Especially on that last one, fourth quarter, we go. We never stop. I had all my homework and film study done. And anyone else who didn’t, we had to run. That’s the way it is. We’re a team.” The Wildcat coaching staff wants the team’s attention, and doesn’t want the win streak to end at five, especially against their Tuolumne County neighbor, a team Sonora has never lost to in 12 meetings dating back to 1964. And Craig’s biggest fear is that his Wildcats won’t play to their potential. “Some of the distractions this week, the shooting threats, the game is in Summerville, that it is Summerville, our county neighbor, I’m afraid that some of those distractions might get to the kids and we won’t play our best game,” Craig said. The Wildcats and Bears are familiar with each other having played 7-on-7 passing scrimmages during the summer and the kids have also likely locked horns as youths. But maybe no Wildcat is more familiar with the Bears than Rosko, who wore the orange and black his freshman year before switching to Wildcat green and gold for his sophomore season. “I went there my freshman year and transferred here for my sophomore year,” Rosko said. “I know a lot of the kids over there and they know me, we’re gonna go out there and knock some heads. They’re friends, but once we’re on the field, there are no friends whatsoever, just competition.” The Wildcats will have their hands full with the Summerville passing attack lead by quarterback Travis Rodgers and receivers JT McCready and Eli McLaurin. Sonora cornerback Johnny Tahara matched up last week against one of the top receivers in the Mother Lode League, Trevor Ramirez, and had him almost shutout until late in the fourth quarter. “Johnny was all over Ramirez, he followed him up and down the field and he didn’t do much until the end,” Craig said. This week, pick your poison, McCready or McLaurin. Tahara will be tracking one or the other at various times all night. “JT, he’s pretty fast and athletic and McLaurin is pretty tall, they’ll give us a good fight,” Tahara said. “But I feel pretty confident. I think we’re practicing good, it’s been a good week.” “They present quite a few problems for us,” Craig said. “Their quarterback throws the ball well. They’ve got Mr. (JT) McCready out there who they like to throw the ball to, but their other wide out (Eli) McLaurin isn’t too bad either. They get their tight end involved. Their fullback is a hard runner …. They can get us in a couple of directions so we’ve gotta play good defense.” And the atmosphere inside Thorsted Field will be something the high school hasn’t seen since, well, probably since the last time these two teams battled there in 1992. 2,500 tickets are being sold and about 4,500 fans attended last year’s game in Sonora. As a sophomore last year, Rosko remembers what it was coming out of the locker room after the junior varsity clash. “There wasn’t a place to sit. I had to wedge myself in to find a seat,” Rosko said. “Friday is gonna be crazy. The stands are gonna be going insane. Us on the field, we’re gonna be going insane. It’s just gonna be wild.” “I think it’s gonna be pretty electric. It’s a big game,” Craig said. “We need to win that game to keep our run going here and they need to win that game to stay in the playoff hunt. So it ought to be an exciting game.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:03:49.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
