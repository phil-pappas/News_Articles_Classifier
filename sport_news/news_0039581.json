Though student-athletes have been using Capt. Gerald F. DeConto Veterans Memorial Stadium, the project honoring the 9/11 hero has not yet been officially dedicated. That will all change at 6 p.m. Friday, Oct. 23, before the Sandwich High School Blue Knights football team takes on the Marshfield Rams, David DeConto, project organizer and brother of Jerry, said. “The stadium has created a buzz,” DeConto said. “I’m hoping people will come out just to see what it’s all about.” DeConto and his mother, Pat, will say a few words and there will be other guest speakers as well. A vocalist from the U.S. Navy War College in Newport, R.I., where Jerry was a graduate, will sing the \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and at least five of Jerry’s Navy classmates will be attending the game. There will also be a special surprise, related to Sept. 11, unveiled that night. Jerry DeConto was killed on that day, in the terrorist attack on the Pentagon. “Blue Knight pride is the theme of the event,” David DeConto said. His brother was an outstanding soccer player for Sandwich before graduating in 1975. “The complex is here for the students of Sandwich High and all other Sandwich schools, as well as for the general public.” The $3 million stadium project was paid for with both private and public funds, which the DeConto family jump-started with a $250,000 donation. Through the years, they have added to that amount, and the family’s contribution now stands at $440,000, David DeConto said. “The support of the town business community and the public was extraordinary,” DeConto said. “This is a town project in every sense and it reflects the respect and caring the town has for its young people.” Plans in the future call for a field house with locker and shower facilities, as well as restrooms for the public, he said. — Follow George Brennan on Twitter: @gpb227 By George Brennan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:05:01.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
