Patience be damned, and Jays manager John Gibbons is the poster boy.\nIf you are of the belief that right-hander Marcus Stroman is starting Game 5 because lefty David Price pitched in relief in Game 4, you have it wrong. The truth is, Price pitched in relief in Game 4 because Stroman was the choice to start Game 5. The Jays’ braintrust made that decision after Game 2, realizing that either Price or Stroman could pitch on regular rest. If they decided then that they preferred Stroman, then the decision to utilize their ace, Price, in a bullpen role was easy — relief or nothing.\nHe did the job they asked. Before the Jays and Rangers tangle on Wednesday afternoon, let’s evaluate individual performances in the first four games, list those that have seized the day and those Jays that need to step it up to help move the team to the next level, the ALCS.\nCarpe diem : Marco Estrada, Kevin Pillar, Marcus Stroman, Josh Donaldson, Troy Tulowitzki, Chris Colabello, Ben Revere, Russell Martin and the relief duo of Roberto Osuna and Aaron Sanchez.\nEstrada effectively turned the series around, taking the ball in Game 3 in Texas and shutting down the Rangers into the seventh inning. The veteran right-hander was sublime, keeping hitters off balance, back-and-forth, mixing in enough curveballs to keep them guessing. Credit catcher Dioner Navarro.\nPillar’s defence has become so taken-for-granted that when he took a jab step in and a Hanser Alberto liner sailed over his head for a double in Game 3 it was almost jarring. Pillar already has made one catch crashing the fence and several racing into the alleys. He has also delivered seven hits, two doubles and a homer, tied for the Jays lead in RBIs with four.\nStroman in Game 2 impressed GM Alex Anthopoulos and manager Gibbons with his poise, keeping it together when the first inning could easily have spiraled out of control. His energy on the mound and the command of his pitches complemented the crowd’s energy. He has plenty of bullets in his right arm after missing much of the season and seems to love the spotlight.\nDonaldson keeps doing his thing, providing an early boost with first-inning homers in two of the four games — in Game 2 against Cole Hamels and Game 4 against Derek Holland. He now has 15 first-inning homers for the year and brings the crowd into it early with their chants of “M-V-P”, even on the road in Texas. His personal goal is to make up for past post-season struggles while a member of the Oakland Athletics.\nTulowitzki’s offensive numbers don’t leap off the page, but with his team down two games to none, he stepped up and was a hero, if just for one day. He walked with the bases loaded, then slammed the key three-run homer that energized the bench and has been his usual steady self in the field.\nColabello has been called upon for three of the four starts at first base, due to the preponderance of left-handers in the Rangers’ rotation. He has four hits, two doubles and a homer and has played decent defence at first. In Game 2, first inning, when the Jays booted the ball around, Colabello registered a rare defensive feat. He had three unassisted putouts, an assist and ended the inning with an unassisted double play, racing across the diamond to tag Prince Fielder at third.\nRevere has six hits and two stolen bases, setting the table in the leadoff spot. His bunt single against Holland in Game 4, forced the pitcher to divide his focus. On a 1-0 slide-step to Donaldson, he drove it out to right field giving the Jays an early 2-0 lead. Revere covers a lot of ground in left.\nSanchez has resumed his role as the eighth-inning man with the injury to Brett Cecil. Osuna, after a shaky end of season, has stepped it up again, throwing mostly to Martin. The two primary relievers have combined for eight shutout innings, with one hit and seven strikeouts.\nStep it up, boys : David Price, Ryan Goins, Edwin Encarnacion, Jose Bautista, Justin Smoak and LaTroy Hawkins. The list is shorter but the need is there if the Jays are to go deep into October.\nPrice will get his chance if the Jays advance in Game 2 of the ALCS. He is still looking for his first post-season win as a starter and was the loser to Cliff Lee in Game 5 to the Rangers in 2010.\nGoins has gone hitless in 13 at-bats with a walk and has not made the same spectacular plays in the field Toronto fans are accustomed to. Encarnacion and Bautista have each homered but have combined for just three RBIs while batting .238. They can be difference-makers in Game 5.\nOf course, if the Jays don’t win the deciding game against Cole Hamels, it will be “wait until next year” with free-agent season less than a month away.\nGame 5 is big for the club’s future plans.\nMore on thestar.com\nThe Blue Jays prepare for Game 5 against the Texas Rangers\nJays’ David Price unlikely to pitch in Game 5 says manager John Gibbons", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:40:20.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
