They know a similar performance is unlikely to be good enough to defeat unbeaten Cincinnati when they play against the Bengals Sunday (KPTV-12 (Fox), 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET).\nThe Seahawks defense played very well against Detroit, until the Lions final drive and the unit was saved by Kam Chancellor and officials who were unfamiliar with rule regarding batted balls. Regardless, the Seahawks do have some momentum with two consecutive wins and a defense that is performing very well.\nThe problem is the unproductive offense, which has sputtered all season. The offensive line is a mess, forcing quarterback Russell Wilson to use his legs to make plays or be sacked far too often. The Seahawks hope to have running back Marshawn Lynch available. Lynch missed the game against Detroit with a hamstring injury.\nThe Bengals (4-0) are off to their best start in a decade. Quarterback Andy Dalton, who heard boos during the latter portion of the 2014 season, is playing the best football of his career. Their wins have come against teams that aren't considered elite squads at this point, and the game against the Seahawks represents a major test and a chance to position themselves as a championship contender.\nIf you want to watch Seahawks against the Bengals, here's what you need to know:\nWhat : Seattle Seahawks at Cincinnati Bengals\nWhere : Paul Brown Stadium, Cincinnati, Ohio\nWhen : Sunday, Oct. 11, 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET\nTV : KPTV-12 (Fox)\nWatch online : You can watch the live stream on DirecTV's live stream package\n-- Geoffrey C.
