He reiterated what has been evident to many who have witnessed Saban's various guest appearances on the ESPN set in recent years.\n\"Coach Saban is great on TV,\" Fitting said. \"I've been lucky enough to work with him on TV for about five years now, and he's a natural. He gets it. He knows how to turn to look at the camera and include the other guys. He knows how to speak in lengths and language that is suited for TV. In terms of the coaches I've been around, he's A-plus on TV.\"\nSaban has appeared on College GameDay and other ESPN college football programs for going on a half-decade, not just when the network visits Tuscaloosa, but for specialty programming after Alabama's season has ended. Among those visits were guest analyst spots prior to the 2011 and 2014 BCS national championship games.\nGameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit predicted last year that Saban would likely become a full-time television analyst whenever he chooses to leave Alabama. However, Fitting said he's not going to put any pressure on Saban to one day join the ESPN crew.\n\"I'm not one of those types that sort of barrages somebody when they're done (coaching),\" Fitting said. \"Coach (Saban) is going to do what coach has got to do. I'm more about giving those guys space. If any coach steps down or retires and wants to do TV, we let that play out.\"\nSpurrier stepped down at South Carolina a week ago, and five days later was on the GameDay set in Ann Arbor, Mich., as a guest analyst. Nevertheless, Fitting quickly sought to put to rest any speculation that Spurrier was \"auditioning\" for a permanent job or might one day replace veteran analyst Lee Corso, who he said is \"not going anywhere\" after recently signing a contract extension.\nStill, Fitting said, Spurrier could have a future in television if he so chooses.\n\"Coach was great,\" Fitting said. \"We had fun. He gave us some insight. He answered some questions. It was everything I was hoping it was going to be. It was newsy, with some entertainment.\"\nOne dilemma faced by career coaches such as Saban and Spurrier — and perhaps even Corso in the beginning — when they make the transition to TV is a reluctance to be too critical of those with whom they shared a profession for so many years. Fitting said such hesitance is understandable, but an ability to dispense fair criticism can develop over the years.\n\"That's human nature,\" Fitting said. \"Coaches don't want to say anything negative about another coach, someone they've coached against or with. That comes over time. I tell them 'it's a lot about how you say it.' Like your parents would tell you, 'it's about the tone, not what you're saying.' If you say it in educated, smart, reasonable way, it's well thought-out and well backed-up, people will respect it. But if you're pounding your fist on the desk saying 'this coach doesn't know what he's doing,' then you look like a fool. It's all about how you deliver it.\"\nElsewhere with GameDay, Rece Davis, a Muscle Shoals native and Alabama graduate, is nearing the halfway point of his first season as the show's permanent host. Davis took over for Chris Fowler, who chose to focus on play-by-play duties this season after 25 years on the GameDay set.\nThe transition from Fowler to Davis has been seamless, Fitting said.\n\"Rece is awesome,\" Fitting said. \"I've known Rece for close to 20 years now. I had not one concern when Rece was going to step into this role and Chris was going to move on. He's a professional, he's prepared, his knowledge is A-plus. He's a great teammate. He's a great leader. It's been a blast and the content has been equally as good.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:38:25.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
