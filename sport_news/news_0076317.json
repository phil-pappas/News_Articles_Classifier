The Braves got contributions from a few different players in that department, something that was obviously stressed. Junior kicker Grant Dafoe gave them a boost with his leg. Dafoe booted through a pair of field goals from 38 yards and 42 yards out. That even gave them the confidence to attempt a 55-yarder. Senior defensive back Jacquille Lot blocked a punt to give the Braves excellent field position. The return game with Knight and Devon Hunter Knight's three returns on kicks or punts averaged 19.3 yards, including a 32-yarder. Hunter had a 75-yard kickoff return that led to Givers-Wilson's touchdown pass to Alabama commit Jaquan Yulee \"Special teams cost us last week, so we focused on that,\" Ferebee admitted. \"We only had but one day of practice. We let the kids rest their legs and worked on special teams assignments, and it showed.\" Getting Devon Involved: Their last time out, Indian River saw Hunter - rated #26 overall in the country and a four-star by Rivals.com in the Class of 2017 - touch the ball on offense just one time, resulting in a six-yard reception. Even though his position for the next level appears to be free safety, it is clear that the Braves want to get his hands on the football more moving forward. Besides his 75-yard return, Hunter touched the ball six times before intermission, racking up 16 yards on three receptions in the first quarter alone. He was snapped the ball out of Wildcat quarterback on a few occasions and even broke off a 32-yard run. \"He led us in touchdowns last year. Now that Tyain is over [here], we don't throw the ball as much as we used to, so we're trying to find creative ways to get him the ball,\" Ferebee pointed out. \"He's been patient and it's starting to come together where we can get him the ball.\" Good, Better, Best: Never let it rest. Until your good is better. And your better is your best. Or something like that, the old saying goes. Indian River senior wide receiver Kyren Best is somewhat quietly having an excellent season to where postseason accolades - such as All-Conference, All-Region and possibly even All-State - may come his way. On a team full of next-level talents and marquee names like Yulee, Beckett, Hunter, Givers-Wilson and Ty Smith among others, his numbers are worth noting. Ferebee remarked. \"He's probably one of the best receivers in the state.\" Best hauled in a touchdown pass. He now has 16 receptions for 346 yards with 7TD's. Though it was not a night to remember by any means for the Warriors, second-year Head Coach David Coccoli Gerard Stringer , made significant contributions. Kiere Landry . In addition, he also had three tackles, two quarterback hurries and a sack. Braimer , a senior DB/WR, caught a 42-yard touchdown pass. Braimer , who returned a kickoff for a score the previous week in a 28-26 loss to Western Branch, deflected a pass in the end zone on third down and recorded a tackle for a loss. , another senior playing at receiver and defensive back, was in on six tackles. Class of 2016 LB Demetrius Stitmon , being courted by VMI and a host of FCS schools, was in on four tackles and one for loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:38:01.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
