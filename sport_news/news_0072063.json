Springdale's public address announcer will do a roll call of every player from the team's varsity roster at 6:40 p.m., with players in attendance honored on the field. There will be designated seating for players during the game. \nThere have been around 25 players who have indicated to director of football operations and former long-time Springdale assistant Dennis DeBusk that they plan to be in attendance. DeBusk and Lori Robinson, a secretary at George Junior High, have overseen much of the planning for the event in an effort to recognize the most recent of the football program's seven state championship teams a decade after they won the title in the final year before the school district split and Malzahn made the jump to collegiate coaching. \n\"I thought it would it be neat if we could get all those kids back together one time,\" DeBusk said. \"Like any reunion, it's a 10-year deal, so lets do it and see what happens.\" \nThe evening will also give the team an opportunity to reconnect at a pre-game cookout, weather permitting, in the school's courtyard, located just off the south end of the stadium, beginning at 5 p.m. The cookout is open to the public. \n\"The players and their families will be involved in the cookout we have every week,\" DeBusk said. \"If they want to tour the (campus' new) building, that would be great. Whatever we can do for them.\" \nSpringdale's run to the state title in 2005 culminated in a 54-20 win over West Memphis in the championship game. The Bulldogs, led by PARADE, Gatorade and USA Today National Player of the Year Mitch Mustain, averaged 47.4 points per game and won by an average margin of 39.1 points, with just three games decided by fewer than 35 points and none closer than 28. Each member of the Springdale 5 signed with a major-college program, with Mustain, Williams, Cleveland and Andrew Norman choosing Arkansas while Webb picked Notre Dame. \nWilliams and Mustain later transferred to Southern California, and Williams had a brief NFL career. \nSports on 10/22/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:37:24.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
