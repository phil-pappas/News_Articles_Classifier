I've started Game One of a World Series in one year and I've been left off of a postseason roster in another.\n\"Through the ups and downs, accepting myself was by far the hardest thing to achieve over the last 15 years.\"\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Andrew Both)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:58:13.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
