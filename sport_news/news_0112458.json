Seats are AWESOME. Cardinals side, section 110, 4th row, on the 30 yard line. And, we are looking for best offer, not face value. Planning on using the sale to help buy playoff tickets or put down payment on next year's tickets. They would be a great Christmas gift, for sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:25:33.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
