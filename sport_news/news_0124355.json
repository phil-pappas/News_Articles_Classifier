Mumbai batsman Shreyas Iyer guides one through the off en route to his double century against Punjab in the second round Raji Trophy match at the Wankhede in Mumbai on Friday 2. Mumbai skipper Aditya Tare smacks one through the covers during the second day against Punjab at the Wankhede in Mumbai on Friday Salman Ansari dna There's an oft-repeated cliché: cricket is an unpredictable game. That banal phrase can sometimes be so true.\nNot many gave Mumbai a chance ahead of their second round Ranji Trophy match after they conceded a first innings lead against lowly Andhra in their first outing. Punjab, their opponents, were coming into the game after posting a comprehensive outright victory over Railways. However, two days into the game, the tables have well and truly turned.\nIf Mumbai's seamers stole the show in the opening day, then their batsmen, and particularly Shreyas Iyer, made the second their own.\nIyer notched up a scintillating maiden double century, while skipper Aditya Tare struck this season's first hundred to help the hosts finish Day Two on 495/6 in 112 overs against Punjab at the Wankhede on Friday.\nAt stumps, wicket-keeper batsman Tare was unbeaten on 111 (140b, 15x4) with Dhawal Kulkarni (30*). The 40-time Ranji champions enjoy a healthy 341-run lead.\nThe highlight of the day was Iyer's 200, which came off just 176 balls and was studded with 25 fours and five hits over the ropes.\nComing into the game after a series of disappointing performances for India 'A' – against Australia 'A' and South Africa 'A' – followed by another one in the first Ranji tie, Iyer had his task cut out. Not only did the 20-year-old have to prove that his tally of 809 runs in the first season was no fluke, Iyer also had to provide Mumbai a platform to go for a win.\nResuming at his overnight score of 61*, Iyer continued to show his attacking instinct. If the ball was pitched full or at length, it was either pierced through covers or flicked through mid-wicket. The short ones were cut hard through point or pulled past square leg.\nThe Punjab spinners – leggie Sarabjit Ladda and left-arm orthodox Varun Khanna – were often at the receiving end of Iyer's ire, being thrown out of the park with some ease.\nSuch was Iyer's domination that his partner Suryakumar Yadav, himself an aggressive batsman, was a mere spectator.\nHowever, Punjab fielders were guilty of giving lives to both, dropping two tough but takeable catches. The pair went on to share a 234-run stand for the third wicket before Yadav (78, 162b, 10x4, 1x6) stepped out to Ladda only to miss the line and get stumped. But he had played the supporting role to perfection.\nIyer completed his maiden double ton with a nudge to square leg off Ladda after hitting seamer Barinder Sran for two fours and a six in the previous over.\nStruggling to dismiss the young batsman, skipper Yuvraj Singh took the matter in his own hands. And he was successful, as Iyer holed out a catch to Siddharth Kaul at long off. Iyer walked back dejected, but not before getting a pat on his back from Yuvraj.\nRevealing his strategy at the end of the day, Iyer said, \"My mindset at the start was just to play straight because the pacers were bowling well. I knew that they had just two pacers, so if I could play out their spell, I could easily dominate the spinners. And I did just that.\n\"It was really important for me to cross 50. I was quite relaxed after that. I wanted to stay not out throughout, play session by session and not think about a big score straightaway. I'm glad that I could execute that,\" he added.\nScorecard\nPunjab 1st innings 154 all out\nMumbai 1st innings (O/N: 103/2)\nS Mangela c Khera b Brainder Sran 7, A Herwadkar c Khera b S Kaul 19, S Iyer c S Kaul b Yuvraj Singh 200, S Yadav st Khera b Ladda 78, AP Tare batting 111, S Lad c Khera b Brainder Sran 28, A Nayar c Vohra b Brainder Sran 5, D Kulkarni batting 30; Extras: (LB2, W1, NB9, Pen 5) 17; Total: (6 wickets; 112 overs) 495 (4.41 runs per over); Fall of wickets: 1-25 (Herwadkar, 6.2 ov), 2-41 (Mangela, 9.5 ov), 3-274 (Yadav, 58.1 ov), 4-338 (Iyer, 68.4 ov), 5-412 (Lad, 87.6 ov), 6-424 (Nayar, 91.2 ov); Bowling: S Kaul 22-2-88-1 (NB4), B Brainder Sran 22-3-87-3 (NB3, W1), V Khanna 28-4-122-0, S Ladda 29-1-154-1 (NB1), Yuvraj Singh 4-0-12-1 (NB1), H Chawla 2-0-6-0, Mandeep Singh 5-1-19-0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:07:04.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
