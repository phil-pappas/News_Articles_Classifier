Residents and tourists hunkered down or tried to make last-minute escapes ahead of what forecasters called a \"potentially catastrophic landfall.\"\nThe storm was homing in on a Pacific coastline dotted with sleepy fishing villages and gleaming resorts, including the popular beach city of Puerto Vallarta and the port of Manzanillo. After hitting land, Patricia's projected path would quickly take it over mountainous terrain that is prone to dangerous flash floods and landslides.\nIn Puerto Vallarta, residents reinforced homes with sandbags and shop windows with boards and tape, and hotels rolled up beachfront restaurants. The airport was closed to flights and all but deserted, but lines formed at a bus station as people sought to buy tickets to Guadalajara and other inland destinations.\nHistory's most destructive hurricanes At a Red Cross shelter, some 90 people waited anxiously in the heavy, humid air, including senior citizens in wheelchairs and young children snuggled between their parents on mattresses on the floor.\nCarla Torres and her family sought refuge there in the afternoon, fearful of what Patricia might do to her home just two blocks from a river in an area vulnerable to high winds.\n\"Here we are with those who can give us help,\" Torres said.\nPeople preparing for the arrival of hurricane Patricia board up the windows of a seaside business in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.

(AP Photo/Cesar Rodriguez) Patricia formed suddenly Tuesday as a tropical storm and quickly strengthened to a hurricane. Within 30 hours it had zoomed to a record-beating Category 5 storm, catching many off guard with its rapid growth. By Friday it was the most powerful hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere, with a central pressure of 880 millibars. Maximum sustained winds hit a high of 200 mph (325 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.\nPatricia's power was comparable to that of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 dead or missing in the Philippines two years ago, according to the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization. More than 4 million people were displaced and over 1 million houses were destroyed or damaged in 44 provinces in the central Visayas region, a large cluster of islands.\nBy late Friday afternoon, Patricia's center was about 60 miles (95 kilometers) west of Manzanillo and about 110 miles (175 kilometers) south-southeast of Cabo Corrientes, with maximum sustained winds eased slightly to 190 mph (305 kph). The Hurricane Center said Patricia was expected to remain an \"extremely dangerous\" Category 5 storm through landfall in late afternoon or evening, before weakening over the inland mountains.\nA worker carries a table at a seaside restaurant preparing for the arrival of hurricane Patricia in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.

Many residents bought supplies ahead of Patricia's arrival. Authorities opened hundreds of shelters, prepared to shut off electricity as a safety precaution and suspended tolls on the Guadalajara-Tepic highway to facilitate the flow of vehicles from the coast.\nAccording to the 2010 census, there were more than 7.3 million inhabitants in Jalisco state and more than 255,000 in Puerto Vallarta municipality. There were more than 650,000 in Colima state, and more than 161,000 in Manzanillo.\nImages on Mexican television showed strong winds whipping palm trees and powerful waves rolling ashore in the storm area.\nPeople walks past a shop with the windows taped in preparation for the arrival of hurricane Patricia in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.

(AP Photo/Cesar Rodriguez) Roberto Ramirez, director of Mexico's National Water Commission, which includes the nation's meteorological service, said Patricia's winds would be powerful enough to lift automobiles, destroy homes that are not sturdily built with cement and steel, and drag anyone caught outside when the storm strikes.\nHe said Patricia was heading in the general direction of Playa Perula, a Pacific coast locale in Jalisco state, with Manzanillo the nearest and most at-risk city for the storm's wrath.\nOne of the worst Pacific hurricanes to ever hit Mexico slammed into the same region, in Colima state, in October 1959, killing at least 1,500 people, according to Mexico's National Center for Disaster Prevention.\nPeople preparing for the arrival of hurricane Patricia box their merchandise at a seafront jewellery shop in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.

But that may not be completely good news, because it would make the overall size of the storm slightly larger, said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric scientist for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\"It's looking like a very bad disaster is shaping up,\" said MIT meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel.\nPeople preparing for the arrival of hurricane Patricia board up and secure as much as they can at a seafront disco in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015.
