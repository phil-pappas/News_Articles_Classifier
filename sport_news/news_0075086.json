Woodchucks have a new field manager \nGedman just completed his second season as the Framingham State University baseball coach, an NCAA Division III program. \n\"He was the right fit. Just in that first phone call, you could tell his passion for the game,\" Treu said Friday afternoon after the Northwoods League team announced the move. \"He is someone who has grown up around baseball, and had a really good college career and then went off to play independent (league) baseball. You just look at the path he has gone on to where he is today. You have to have a lot of passion for baseball to go that route, \n\"He is one of the first guys we talked to and he just kind of stuck with us right off that first conversation,\" Treu said. \"As we went along (in the search) it always went back to him and that is where we ended up.\" \nGedman, whose father, Rich, played for the Boston Red Sox and is the batting coach for the Red Sox AAA team in Pawtucket , takes over for Jordan Bischel. Gedman is the Woodchucks third manager in as many years. \nBischel, who is the baseball coach at Northwood University in Midland, Mich., stepped away after the Woodchucks finished with a 24-47 record. \n\"Obviously last year we had a disappointing season on the field, but it was just a mutual decision (with Bischel),\" Treu said. \"With Jordan's commitment being a head coach where he is (in Michigan) and with his family, he just couldn't commit to us for next summer.\" \nPrior to Framingham State University, Gedman spent four seasons as an assistant coach at Bryan University, a Division 1 program. He was the hitting coach in addition to leading the recruiting efforts. \nGedman played at Le Moyne College before transferring to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He two seasons playing for the Brainerd Lunkers, a former Northwoods League team, where he was a Northwoods League All-Star. \n\"When we started looking for a new manager we were thinking about people who had some sort of Northwoods League experience, just because our league is a little bit different than other summer (college) league just with the sheer number of games to play,\" Treu said. \"He has played in the league and understands it. I also wanted someone who has a recruiting background, and had connections because that always helps down the road (in building the team.). \n\"We also wanted someone who had experience in pro baseball in some shape or form because our league is about developing players to get to pro ball,\" Treu said. \"It's nice to have someone who can tell them what (the journey) is like.\" \nTim Johnson can be reached at 715-845-0731 or at timothy.johnson@gannettwisconsin.com.
