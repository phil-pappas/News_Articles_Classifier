Both times, Schrage led 5-4 before breaking Cerdan’s serve to win the set. \nInterestingly, it was the first time they faced off in an actual match, having only played practice sets. Schrage said it \"brought up the level of play for both of us.\" \nAfter her riveting slugfest against Cerdan, Schrage beat Holy Angels freshman Ashley Hess in the semifinals, 6-0 and 6-0. \nEarlier in the day, the sixth-seeded Hess defeated East Brunswick’s 10th-seeded Jennifer Chen in the quarterfinals by scores of 6-3 and 7-6(5). In the doubles competition, Northern Highlands’ sixth-seeded pair of Sarah Apsey and Chloe Decker dropped a super tiebreaker to Millburn’s top-seeded Isabella Waung and Sydney Zirlin in the quarterfinals (6-1, 4-6, 10-7). © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:27:25.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
