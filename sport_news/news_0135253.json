By Ken Corbitt ken.corbitt@cjonline.com \nMANHATTAN — A new offense and coordinators revamped TCU’s offense last season and the results were eye-popping when the Horned Frogs ranked No. 2 in the nation by scoring 46.5 points a game and No. 5 in total offense with 533.0 yards. \nWith a year in the system under their belt, the Frogs are even more productive this season with 50.8 points and 630.0 yards a game through five games. Both figures rank No. 2 in the nation behind Big 12 rival Baylor. \n“They have a lot of guys back with a lot of experience,” Kansas State linebacker Will Davis said. “Any time you have experience, you’re going to be better than you were last year. They are a talented group.” \nK-State (3-1, 0-1 Big 12) will attempt to slow down and keep up with No. 2 TCU (5-0, 2-0) at 6:30 p.m. Saturday at Bill Snyder Family Stadium. \n“It puts a lot of pressure on us that we have to score,” Wildcats quarterback Joe Hubener said. “We know they’re going to score. Our defense will do their job and slow them down but they’re still going to put up points, so our offense has to counter that and put up points ourselves.” \nInjuries have hampered the TCU defense, traditionally the team’s strength under coach Gary Patterson, but the Frogs are getting players back on the field, particularly along the defensive line. \nK-State coach Bill Snyder believes the current edition of the Frogs is better than a year ago. \n“I think they’re better on both sides of the ball,” Snyder said. “They’re young defensively but the same guys playing week in and week out, you see them getting better. \n“They are experienced on offense. I think they have eight or nine starters back, and obviously (quarterback Trevone) Boykin and the receivers.” \nBoykin is the Big 12 leader in total offense with 408.0 yards a game (360.4 passing) and wide receiver Josh Doctson had 42 receptions for 722 yards and eight touchdowns. The Frogs also have a strong rushing attack with Aaron Green averaging 100.8 yards a game. \n“It makes them hard to defend,” Davis said. “They’ve put up points all year against everyone. Every player on their offense is explosive and that presents problems for us, but we’re excited for the challenge.” \nThe Wildcat defense is licking its wounds from a week ago when Oklahoma State put together two late-game drives for a touchdown and a field goal to pull out a 36-34 victory. \n“They executed down the stretch and we didn’t,” Davis said. “That’s part of our mantra for the week: To execute at crunch time.” \nThe emphasis for K-State is getting off the field with third-down stops, a sore spot last week. \n“We’ve got to play better and put them in the best positions we can put them in and they have to make plays,” Snyder said. “They throw it up there and they went up and caught it and we have to get up there and compete for it and bat more of them down than we did. And we let some shorter routes turn into big plays to convert some third-and-extra long situation. We have to do what we do and do it better.” \nKen Corbitt can be reached at (785) 295-1123 or ken.corbitt@cjonline.com .Follow Ken on Twitter @KenCorbitt .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:58:27.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
