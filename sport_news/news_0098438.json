Which, for the tattle-tale Colts, means trouble, with a capital T, that rhymes with B, and that stands for Brady, who’ll be pumped — not deflated — and jacked to take on Indy next Sunday in the much-anticipated Deflategate Bowl. Considering the Pats have won their first four games by an average score of 37-19, and beat the Colts twice last year by scores of 42-20 and 45-7, one can only imagine how many points they’ll be looking to rack up this time around. You can be sure of one thing — they won’t be looking to keep the score down. For 30 minutes Sunday, the Patriots struggled to score against the Cowboys, leading only 13-3 at halftime as they had problems protecting Brady. “They played a few different fronts, a few different coverages — stuff they hadn’t shown,” said Brady, who was sacked five times in the first half. In the second half, despite having to replace injured left tackle Nate Solder with Marcus Cannon, the Pats didn’t allow a sack and rolled past the hurtin’ Cowboys, 30-6, before a throng of 93.054 in the Jerry Jones Pigskin Palace of Excess. And so, now 4-0, they’re on to Indianapolis. Which is a long way from where they were a year ago at this stage. Four games into the 2014 season, they were 2-2 and coming off an embarrassing, 41-14, thrashing at the hands of the Chiefs in a nationally-televised, Monday Night Football game in Kansas City. It was one of the worst losses in the Bill Belichick Era in New England, and the Patriots were every bit as bad as the score indicated. Their offensive line was in disarray, Brady and his receivers weren’t in synch, and the defense was struggling, having given up 33 points in a loss at Miami in the season opener. So it was that, after that horrendous game against the Chiefs, and for the entire week before they played the Bengals, a perturbed and petulant Belichick kept repeating the same mantra: “We’re on to Cincinnati.” As it turned out, the Patriots turned things around quickly, beating the Bengals, 43-17, and then went on to win the Super Bowl. Which raises this question: If the Pats won the NFL championship after looking so bad through the first four games a year ago, is there any reason to think they’re not in the fast lane on the road to a repeat after steamrolling their first four opponents this season? As long as the 38-year-old Brady stays healthy — reach out immediately, Pats fans, and knock on wood — it’s hard to imagine anyone in the AFC East keeping New England from winning a seventh straight division title. In fact, as long as Brady stays healthy, it’s hard to imagine the Patriots losing even a game. Which is why it was worrisome to see him battered and sacked repeatedly in the first half by a Dallas defense sparked by the return of hard-to-handle, hard-to-like end Greg Hardy, who’s a much better pass rusher than he is a person, as evidenced by his sack totals Sunday and his conviction last year on a domestic abuse charge for beating his then-girlfriend. Playing for the first time since the opening game last season, when he was with Carolina, Hardy had two sacks. He was suspended for 15 games last year, and the first four this year. With Solder sidelined by an elbow injury —“That was the call (the doctors) made,” he said. “We’ll see what happens going forward. They haven’t made any conclusions yet.”— Cannon took over at left tackle. “He went in and played great,” Solder said. “That’s what we practice for,” Cannon said. “So that, if we’re called on, we can do our job,” Cannon said. The Patriots have been getting the job done, week after week. And making it look easy. They’re looking much better four games into the 2015 season than they did after four games last year. And we know how we that turned out. There is every reason, right now, to be optimistic about the undefeated, and thus far unchallenged, Patriots. Especially now that they’ve demolished Dallas and are on to Indianapolis.
