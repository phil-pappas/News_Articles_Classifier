Hilton (13) in the first half of an NFL football game in Indianapolis, Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) Posted: Monday, October 19, 2015 7:00 am \nBIG SHOWS \n1. Danny Amendola – Seven catches for 105 yards. Certainly did his job. \n2. Jamie Collins – Forget everything else on the night. The running leap over center and bum-block of Adam Vinatieri's PAT kick might be one of the great plays in history. \n3. Rob Ninkovich – Did not get in on the Pats sack party, but man was he disruptive. Drew at least three holding calls. And this was on a night where the pass rushers were basically on their own. Couldn't run at him either, as he played very stout at the edge. One of the great one-tackle games in the history of NFL defense. \nNO SHOWS \n1. Dion Lewis – Clearly, the injury that cost him practice time certainly has slowed him down some. Finished with just 39 yards of offense in an otherwise slow night. \n2. Devin McCourty – Man, he's always a step late. And now, the penalties are starting to mount. Supposed to be a leader. I don't see it. I don't like the attitude the secondary is showing on the field. I blame him. \n3. Jerod Mayo – Forced to play early because the Colts were moving the ball and Jonathan Freeny looked way out of place in there. Mayo came on and looked, slow, old and overwhelmed. No tackles, early exit, too. \nGRADING THE GROUPS \nOFFENSE \nLine (A) … Considering this group has to make introductions to the new guys before every play, the effort was commendable. The Colts hardly affected Tom Brady and the Pats ran for what was a solid 4.6 yards a carry. Who are you people? \nRunning Backs (B+) … Dion Lewis' contribution wasn't as good as it has been, making you wonder how hurt he might be. LeGarrette Blount's a pro. He rolled up 93 yards on 16 tries, catching a TD pass and running for a score. Too. \nWide receivers (C+) … Julian Edelman's drop, that popped right into the Colts' hands for an easy TD, was not a quality bid. I'd love to tell you that former No. 2 pick Aaron Dobson will make the active 45 again. But I can't. He sat again. Keep the expectations as low as possible with these guys, at least until Brandon LaFell returns. \nTight ends (B-) … Scott Chandler is a huge disappointment, and the push off he was flagged for simply was the latest disappointment. I know the big fella is a better player than this.Teams continue to pummel Gronk (3 catches, 50 yards, but he finds a way to contribute. \nQuarterback (A-) … The numbers say a rating of 104.8. He's played much better against these guys. But this performance was plenty good. \nDEFENSE \nLine (B-) … So tough to judge. They were put in a tough spot by the game plan. Dominique Easley draw praise shooting his gap ferociously. Frank Gore did enjoy success running tackle-to-tackle. And Luck went untouched for the longest of stretches. \nJamie Collins (A) … He's the only real linebacker left it seems like. Jonathan Freeny and Jerod Mayo tried, but man is this group a thin one. The blocked PAT meant nothing, but wow, was it impressive. And the game plan truly left this play-maker way out of position. But he continues to do all he's asked. \nSecondary (Impossible to grade) … They fail under a usual scale. Asked last night to cover forever than tackle hard, they get an A+. Devin McCourty and Logan Ryan, each of whom gave up big, big plays repeatedly without being at fault, tackled very well. The bottom line is Andrew Luck could not exploit the soft coverage like a Brady or Aaron Rodgers might. \n` \nHUGE PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES \nHow do you make a bad QB mediocre, a mediocre QB average, an average QB good, a good QB great and a great QB unbeatable? \nAsk Matt Patricia. \nSeriously, a week after he riddled Dallas with some of the most aggressive defensive play-calling of his life, Patricia lost confidence in his defense. \nThe result? \nA decent Colts team with a decent quarterback was left to hang around all night long, forcing an onside kick in the final minute in a game that should have been put away well before the 11 O'clock news kicked in. \nLook, Patricia gets the last laugh. His strategy, “worked.” The Pats won Sunday night. \nA year ago, at Green Bay, Patricia employed the same rush 3-or-4 men and drop everyone else into coverage. The Pats won, 26-21, but Aaron Rodgers threw for 368 yards and a pair of touchdowns. \nAgainst Andrew Luck Sunday, New England did the same, and the Colts put up three offensive TDs. \nIt's a victory, but I just don't get it. \nToday (Monday) people all over New England will be lauding Chandler Jones and his 2.5 second-half sacks. Do you realize the only reason he was allowed to rush the passer was that Jabaal Sheard got hurt and left the game? In the first half, Jones dropped into coverage regularly. \nLook, Patricia nearly buried this team in the Super Bowl last year. The fact is Malcolm Butler saved his bacon. \nThe guy has proven he can draw up creative blitz packages. It's just a shame he refuses to use them. \nBEATING THE DEAD HORSE \nThe next immortal, Andrew Luck, was basically running a 7-on-7 passing drill all night, with no pass rush from the Patriots whatsoever. \nSo how did Andrew Almighty respond? Holding a one-point lead to start the third quarter, Luck hit 13 of 28 passes for 162 yards. And take away the Colts final minute possession when the Pats played defense well after they had popped the champagne bottles, it was really an 8-for-21, 80-yard half. \nWhat a chump! \nSUNDAY NIGHT CHATTER \nOfficiating remains so darn inconsistent in the game. It continues to bear itself out as that. The pathetic missed calls from games earlier in the day floated into the Pats-Colts. \nYes, it was offensive interference on the Scott Chandler TD catch. But there's no way Sebastian Vollmer deserved a hands-to-the-face call earlier on that drive. … \nUp next, Ryan Fitzpatrick and the New York Jets at Gillette Stadium Sunday. Should be another thriller, right? New England has already opened as a 10-point favorite in Las Vegas.
