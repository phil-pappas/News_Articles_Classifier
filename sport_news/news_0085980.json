Kessinger-Wassom played for the Threshers four years. She started as the team's No. 5 singles and No. 3 doubles player her first year and improved to be the No. 1 player by her senior year. Published: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 5:15 PM CDT Mary Kessinger-Wassom was just a freshman tennis player at Bethel College during the 1988-89 season, but what that Thresher team accomplished 27 years ago earned the eight players and two coaches entry into the North Newton school’s athletic hall of fame Friday.Wassom is the only one of the eight players to coach. She said it was that team, those players and the coaches who helped shape her career.“It was a long time coming,” she said of the induction. “I haven’t seen some of them since they left. To be reunited with my teammates was worth it.”Wassom played for a Bethel team that won its first conference women’s tennis team title and had six returning KCAC champions. The Threshers were district champions and 17th at national. Wassom came into the program knowing the strengths of the other players. She went from being the team’s No. 5 singles and No. 3 doubles player her freshman season to being No. 1 her senior year.“I’m the one who was lucky to get to play with them,” she said. “It was such an honor to be in a program that was that strong. It made a huge impact on my career. I thought I was a strong player in high school, but I was nothing in college till they developed me into the player I became. They made a huge impact on my life.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:04:58.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
