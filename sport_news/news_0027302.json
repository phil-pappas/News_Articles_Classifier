Blue 0 \nAt Rockport Oct. 10, the Windjammers creased the net three times in the second half as they sailed to their eighth win. The squads were scoreless at halftime. \nKieran Lydon scored twice for the Windjammers and Josiah Krul once, while Noah Heidorn, Morgan Mercier and Andy Gross logged assists. \nCamden Hills held a 27-1 lead in shots and an 8-1 advantage in corner kicks. Lucas Boetsch made one save in goal for the Windjammers, while Joe Bowering made 13 saves in net for the Cougars. \n\"The boys ground out a good victory today in front of an outstanding crowd at homecoming,” said Camden Hills coach Ryan Hurley. “Mount Blue played us tough the first half and we came out in the second half and executed offensively much better. It's a good win and was an awesome day of soccer at Camden Hills.” \nThe Cougars bottled up the Windjammer scoring chances in the first half, but the tone was set 20 seconds into the second 40 minutes when Lydon made a break for the goal and crossed it into Kienan Brown, who nearly scored but got tangled with the Cougar keeper as the ball rolled away from the goal and down the end line. \nRoughly five minutes later the Windjammers broke through when Heidorn chipped a beautiful ball from the midfield over the Cougar defense and onto the foot of Lydon, who broke free and creased the net with 34:34 left. \nLydon added another goal, off an assist from Mercier, with 24:15 remaining, while Krul took a pass from Gross and shook off a pair of Cougar defenders and found the back of the net at the 22:24-mark. \nHurley said the state of the program is in solid condition. \n“I had the opportunity to watch our freshmen team defeat a very good Mount Ararat team 8-2, the jayvees played great and defeated Mount Blue 4-1 and then, of course, the encore was the varsity game. The whole program is in great shape and it was awesome to have so many positive supporters there today. On to Tuesday and a Messalonskee team that will surely be a stiff test.\" \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class A North, Camden Hills (8-2-2, 82.0408 points) is third, while Lewiston (12-0, 121.8367 points) is first in the 14-team region. The top 10 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nGirls soccer \nCamden Hills 6, Lawrence 0 \nAt Rockport Oct. 10, the Windjammers jammed on as they remained unbeaten with a win over the Bulldogs. Camden Hills led 3-0 at halftime. \nKassie Krul creased the net twice in the win for the hosts, while Eliza Roy (goal, assist), Bryn Anderson (goal), Charlotte Messer (goal, assist) and Izzy Gutheinz (goal) also chipped in on offense. \nJana Spieker made one save on one shot in goal for Camden Hills. The hosts held an 18-1 edge in shots and a 7-0 advantage in corner kicks. \nKrul, Roy and Anderson scored in the first half, after which veteran Windjammer coach Meredith Messer issued a challenge to her girls. \n\"Being in the lead 3-0 at half I challenged the girls to increase the speed of their passing and decrease the space between them when they were passing and receiving,” the coach said. “They improved the level of possession in the second half that led to three more goals and two crossbars that were very close to going in.” \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class A North, Camden Hills (11-0-1, 123.1633 points) is first in the 14-team region. The top 10 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:23:08.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
