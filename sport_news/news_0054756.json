Planes flying shorter routes from the east also have increased, he said.\nAs a result, one runway, which can safely accommodate about 40 landings per hour, is not enough, said Douglas Goldberg, of Landrum & Brown, which specializes in airport planning. Two runways are necessary for arrivals, which have increased from an hourly average of 55 between 6 and 7 a.m. last year, to about 63 arrivals per hour this year, Goldberg told the committee.\n\"There's more movements, more arrivals, than the airport can handle with one runway,\" Goldberg said while displaying slides showing how large banks of planes arrive within about an hour, followed by a huge departure push roughly two hours later.\n\"Because we have more demand during that (6 a.m.) hour than we can safely serve with one runway, fly quiet is not in place. Fly quiet is not used at all,\" Goldberg said.\nStarting at 7 a.m., three runways for arrivals and three departure runways are typically used throughout the day until 10 p.m., when the voluntary fly-quiet program begins and is supposed to continue, with one arrival and runway and one departure runway, until 7 a.m. Wind direction and other factors can lead O'Hare tower to alter plans.\n5 ways to improve O'Hare Jon Hilkevitch and Gregory Karp Worrisome headwinds swirled this week as O'Hare International Airport opened its third new runway since 2008.\nThe almost $10 billion airfield modernization that former Mayor Richard M.

Daley first laid out in 2001, featuring six parallel runways, was hailed as a game changer that would transform...\n(Jon Hilkevitch and Gregory Karp) A secondary noise-related problem is a growth in flights between 10 and 11 p.m., Goldberg said.\nGoldberg and an official from the Chicago Department of Aviation said the city will soon offer alternatives to the committee to \"fine tune\" the 20-year-old fly quiet program.\nThe concepts outlined were the same general ideas proposed in July by Chicago Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans, who attended Monday's meeting but did not speak.\nPossible solutions to help mitigate jet noise in Chicago wards east of O'Hare and suburbs mainly to the west include:\n•Spreading out flights over the Chicago area by rotating designated fly quiet runways on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis.\n•Improving adherence by controllers and pilots to using the existing fly-quiet corridors over industrial areas, forest preserves and highways, while still keeping the program voluntary.\n•Creating a separate voluntary fly quiet program covering the \"shoulder hours\" — 10 to 11 p.m. and 6 to 7 a.m.\nO'Hare opens new runway Jon Hilkevitch The city of Chicago and about 500 enthusiastic invited guests heralded the opening Thursday of a new runway at O'Hare International Airport.\nOfficials from the city, airlines and Federal Aviation Administration all predicted substantial efficiency and capacity gains at delay-plagued O'Hare, even...\nThe city of Chicago and about 500 enthusiastic invited guests heralded the opening Thursday of a new runway at O'Hare International Airport.\nOfficials from the city, airlines and Federal Aviation Administration all predicted substantial efficiency and capacity gains at delay-plagued O'Hare, even...\n(Jon Hilkevitch) Catherine Dunlap, who chairs the O'Hare Noise Compatibility Commission's technical committee, expressed frustration over how long it's taking the city to develop a comprehensive plan addressing O'Hare noise.\n\"I just want to make sure the public knows we are talking about the same things that we talked about before\" in July, Dunlap told the other members of the Fly Quiet Committee.\nThe next move will be for the committee to issue recommendations to the full commission. That could occur as early as next month, said Joseph Annunzio, the committee chairman.\nThe commission would then make a formal request to the Chicago Department of Aviation to conduct a technical evaluation — based on population and noise levels in specific communities, land-use policies and other factors — for the FAA to review. The final decision is up to the FAA.\nOfficials declined to offer even a tentative timeline for implementing noise abatement measures that would provide relief to residents living under flight paths that have changed since the first runway in the nearly $10 billion O'Hare expansion program opened in 2008.\n\"We will examine all proposals given to us\" by the city aviation department and the noise commission, FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro said after Monday's meeting, which was held at the city aviation department headquarters at O'Hare.\njhilkevitch@tribpub.com\nTwitter @jhilkevitch\n O'Hare International Airport Federal Aviation Administration Jon Hilkevitch", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fe2b6/turbine/ct-ohare-runway-opening-met-1016-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5620751a/turbine/ct-ohare-delays-solutions-met-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625463a/turbine/ct-ohare-fly-quiet-met-1020-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:29:11.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
