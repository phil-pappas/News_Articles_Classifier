But the New York-based company says it doesn't want to rely only on what it knows right now.\nFanDuel says it has also hired former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey to evaluate its internal controls.\nThe company's announcement comes after New York's attorney general sent letters to DraftKings and FanDuel on Tuesday demanding they turn over details of any investigations into their employees.\nNBA: Knicks coach Derek Fisher was involved in an altercation with Memphis Grizzlies forward and former Lakers teammate Matt Barnes in California on Saturday, a person with knowledge of the details said. The New York Post, citing an anonymous source, reported Wednesday that the altercation was because Fisher is dating Barnes' estranged wife. Fisher filed for divorce from his wife, Candace , in March. The person said Fisher traveled to Los Angeles after practice Saturday to see his children and the altercation happened that night while Fisher was attending a gathering at the home of Gloria Govan , Barnes' estranged wife. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no comments were authorized. Fisher coached the Knicks against a Brazilan club team on Wednesday.\nObituary: Harry Gallatin , a seven-time All-Star forward for the Knicks in the 1950s, died Wednesday. He was 88.\n— Wire reports", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/43/8755397/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/43/8755397/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/43/8755398/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/43/8755398/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:24:53.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
