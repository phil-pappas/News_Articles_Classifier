Given how many times I've been wrong going against the Governors over the years, I am firmly convinced they would beat the New England Patriots if I sided with Belichicks Boys over Jimmy O.\n The only other loss came in Abington where I rolled the dice with the Green Wave, thinking the loss of quarterback Ryan Graham to injury would really hurt East Bridgewater. The Vikings proceeded to roll over my pick early and often.\n As Coach Bill would say, on to Week 5.\n NORTH ANDOVER over Billerica: Have a feeling the Scarlet Knight running game is going to a major factor.\n Bridgewater-Raynham over DARTMOUTH: While Dartmouth is the defending Division 3 state champion, Bridgewater-Raynham is the defending OCL champion.\n MARSHFIELD over Falmouth: Love the job Derek Almeida is doing at Falmouth, but conquering the Rams is a very tall order.\n COHASSET over St. John Paul: Skippers showing that the road to Div. 6 glory still runs through Pond Street\n BEVERLY over Marblehead (at Endicott): If for no other reason, I would hate to have to listen to Chris McDonough crucifying me on twitter.\n Walpole over WELLESLEY: Rebels take down a second consecutive undefeated team here.\n XAVERIAN over Brockton: Lots of defense here and no one does it better than the Hawks.\n GOVERNOR'S ACACDEMY over BB&N: BB&N might get its points, but not sure it will be able to keep the Governors from getting theirs.\n Central Catholic over TEWKSBURY: Ever-so-slight nod to the Raiders, whose younger players are getting better each week.\n DUXBURY over Plymouth North: Dragons continue their reign of terror in the Patriot League.\n Home team in caps\n LAST WEEK: 8-2 (.800)\n SEASON TO DATE: 31-9 (.775)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:24:19.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
