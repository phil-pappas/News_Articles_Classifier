Marchand actually brought about the blow, charging in from the side to try and hit Weise and skating into his elbow.\nThe concussion diagnosis was pretty evident in seeing a wobbly Marchand needing help to get off the ice and to the dressing room after the accidental hit.\n“We’re going about it with the league’s protocol (on concussions),” B’s coach Claude Julien said after practice. “His return will be dictated by how quickly he recovers. We have no timetable for him.”\nThe potential good news was that defenseman Zdeno Chara (upper-body injury), out since incurring what appeared to be an injury to his torso Sept. 24, could return today against the Steven Stamkos and the Stanley Cup finalist Bolts.\n“I would say questionable,” Julien said of Chara. “We haven’t made that decision yet. It’s going to be done at some point with the medical staff — see if it warrants a go or not. If it doesn’t, it’s probably going to be a few more days. It’s not just pain, but more the risk that’s at stake. He’s very tolerant when it comes to pain; it’s a matter of whether he’s good to go and what’s the risk factor.”\nThe Bruins would have to clear a roster spot for Chara, and likely did so by placing defenseman Matt Irwin on waivers.\nPart of an overall blue line corps that has not looked good in the season-opening losses to Winnipeg and Montreal, Irwin had an especially inauspicious minus-5 start with his new team. The 27-year-old was a UFA signing (one year, $800,000) after posting 8-11—19 totals last season in 53 games for San Jose.\nBut he has already had several costly turnovers or coverage errors that led to goals.\n“Matt’s been put on waivers,” Julien said. “There’s nothing more, as far as no decisions will be made until we see if he clears or not.”\nIt seems quite probable Irwin will not be claimed. He could then end up with Providence of the AHL.\nThe day’s line-shuffling saw Brett Connolly moved to Patrice Bergeron’s right with Loui Eriksson on the left.\n“I’m excited,” Connolly said. “(It is) obviously a good challenge, a good chance to kind of get back on the right track. It’s been a tough two games, but that’s the good thing about playing a game close to the one before: You can bounce back, have a better game and start feeling better about yourself.”\nThe new-look No. 3 line had Ryan Spooner between Chris Kelly and Jimmy Hayes. Julien was critical of the Spooner-Connolly-Hayes trio’s play in Games 1 and 2.\n“They’ve got to be a little heavier as a line,” Julien said. “They’re losing too many battles. Because of that they’re not spending enough time (in the offensive zone) and having the opportunities to create enough. In order to be successful you’ve got to win those battles for pucks and races, and be strong on them. I think as a line they can be better there.\n“They’ve got the skill level. You look at (Hayes): He does a great job going to the net. He’s got a good shot; he scored 19 goals last year. He’s got that ability. Same thing with Brett Connolly. He can skate, he can do lot of things. Spoons, we know how skilled he is. Right now it’s just a matter of getting a little harder on pucks and more determined to win more battles rather that losing them.”\nThat willingness to play harder is one aspect of the B’s problems, although hardly the only one. All the talk about generating more speed and offense seems to have created confusion and breakdowns. On maybe 6-of-8 non-empty net goals the team has allowed, mistakes handed the Jets and Canadiens easy scores.\n“We’ve got to continue to try and get better as a team,” Julien said. “There’s lot of work to be done, we know that. There’s still a lot of mistakes being made; we need to get on the same page.\n“We’re not the only team that’s 0-2 right now. But we’ve got to keep working on making our team better. The schedule doesn’t get any easier.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:44:09.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
