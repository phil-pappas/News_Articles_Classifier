The Gladiators finished the regular season at 7-3 and locked in the third seed in the Eastern Football League. They will host the Eastern Mass Seminoles in the first round of the playoffs this Saturday at 7 p.m. at Taunton High School. Taunton jumped out to an early 20-6 lead against the Bruins and never looked back. Quarterback Matthew Letourneau had 231 yards of passing and two touchdowns. Former Bristol-Plymouth running back Jeremie Chumack added 98 yards on the ground with three touchdowns. While the offense garnered most of the highlights, the play of the night came from the defense when Rashawn Jones recovered a fumble on Taunton’s own one-yard line and tossed it to Michael Leoncello for a combined 99-yard touchdown return. According to assistant Head Coach, Dave Rodrigues, the Gladiators are following a familiar roadmap. “This team tends to find itself during the regular season and really gear up for the playoff run so to end the season on a high note was something we were striding for,” Rodrigues said. “Taking that momentum in to the playoffs will be a good confidence booster and hopefully put us in the right mindset”. The Gladiators were once again one of the most prolific offenses in the league this year, finishing second in scoring (27 ppg.) as well as in yards produced. Offensive Coordinator Kahn Lima credits quarterback Matthew Letourneau and the rest of this offense for grasping the new scheme and delivering on its promise.” Letourneau finished the season with 1,504 yards passing, 15 touchdowns and just seven interceptions. “We had a lot of turnovers in the beginning of the season and had some red zone issues,” Letourneau said. “Once we figured out what we had, we really got in rhythm, gained some confidence and cut down on a lot of the mental mistakes as the season went on.” The Gladiators are still a run first team and that was exemplified by an exceptional rushing game in 2015. Taunton averaged 158.4 yards per game on the ground led by the Chumack (631 yards), former Taunton High 2,000 yard rusher John Gordon (437 yards) and newcomer Carl Cadet (343 yards). “Being able to run the football like we did took a lot of pressure off of Matty and the receivers and enabled them to have the year they had as well,” Rodrigues said. Defensively, the Gladiators are led be a stalwart defensive line anchored by Nick Rossi, Mac Maclagan, Chris Horne and Taunton native Darius Shanks. The linebacking core was anchored by long-time Gladiator Ray Tolliver along with Rashawn “OJ” Jones and Taunton native Joshua Barbour.

While the Gladiators wrapped up the regular season in a positive manner, Rodrigues stresses the real season has just begun and Gladiators have their hands full. “Yeah, we have had some decent success over the past number of years,” Rodrigues said. “We attract a lot of new guys each year, but the reason we can be as consistent as we have been is that we can rely on the lunch pail guys like Matty Letourneau, Chewie (Chumack), (Michael) Leoncello and our left tackle Bedo (Benson Faroul). These guys show up every day, set the tone for the team and understand what’s expected of them.” By Staff Reports The Taunton Daily Gazette, Taunton, MA By Staff Reports Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 10:48 PM Updated at 10:58 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:55:42.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
