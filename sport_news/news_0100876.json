Authorities closed the highway between Benton City and Prosser mid-Saturday afternoon because of the crashes and a grass fire in the area. Courtesy Benton Fire District 1 i Order Reprint of this Story \nHigh winds are to blame for car pileups on Interstate 82 and Highway 221 Saturday, forcing state officials to shut both down completely to treat crash victims, clear the scenes and extinguish a grass fire ignited by a burning vehicle. \nWashington State Patrol confirmed to the Herald troopers began responding around 3:30 p.m. to multiple collisions at milepost 91 on the interstate, about five miles west of Benton City. Devin Helland with Benton Fire District 1 said about 10 cars were involved in the incident, caused by smoke from a grass fire blowing across the roadway, and the Yakima Herald-Republic reported at least 10 people were injured, a few being transported to area hospitals. \nMeanwhile first responders reported blackout conditions on Highway 221, which links Prosser and Paterson. As many as 20 vehicles were involved in that pileup where blowing dust severely reduced visibility. \n“They had a few ejected from their cars and they’re in critical condition,” said Benton County sheriff’s corporal Jason Erickson. \nIt was a vehicle burning on the shoulder of the interstate near Benton City that ignited a grass fire that was fed by the afternoon’s strong winds, said Capt. Seth Johnson of West Benton Fire & Rescue. That blew a thick bank of smoke across the roadway, limiting visibility, and some drivers failed to reduce their speed to the conditions. \nAll crash victims were treated by 7 p.m., Johnson said, and the interstate, which was closed between Prosser and Benton City, was expected to reopen later Saturday night. The fire is estimated to have burned between 500 and 600 acres and fire crews were in mop up early in the evening. \nState officials shut down Highway 221 in both directions just before 6 p.m., with the same front that stoked the flames along the interstate sending dust into the air, making it impossible to see, officials said. \n“Even the fire trucks were at a standstill, going one mile an hour,” said Helland of what he’d heard from responding agencies. \nFurther details about injuries in the pileup on 221 were unavailable. It was unclear when the highway could reopen. \nTy Beaver: 509-582-1402; tbeaver@tricityherald.com ; Twitter: @_tybeaver Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:22:10.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
