In a throwback game in which defense dominated, East Duplin downed Southwest 14-0 in the East Central 2-A Conference opener for both teams. The teams combined for 358 yards total offense and only one offensive touchdown. The other score came on a 40-yard interception by Cameron Hall, who had two picks. “That’s what you should expect from Southwest-East Duplin,” Dempsey said, referring to the down-and-gritty, defensive battle. “I told these guys that before the game. They came out and they played hard and they rise to the challenge. “This is the team (East Duplin) that is kind of expected to finish at the top in the conference and we proved we could hang right there with them. So hopefully we can build from this. It was a tough loss, but hopefully our guys take from this we can play with anybody. “You never know what’s going to happen to them. With our conference, I feel everybody is fairly even. You just never know what can happen week in and week out. We’ve got to keep playing to make sure we take advantage of the opportunities.” East Duplin coach Battle Holley echoed Dempsey’s view of the ECC’s toughness. “This conference,” he said, “you’re going to have to come ready to play every week in this conference.” Punt at opponent’s 30? On its first possession, East Duplin drove from its 32-yard line to the Southwest 18 – and appeared to have it first-and-goal at the 9 after a 9-yard gain on fourth-and-1. But a holding penalty – three officials threw flags on the play – left the Panthers facing fourth-and 30. So Holley opted for a quick kick by Hall, who along with playing cornerback is also the team’s starting quarterback. The kick was caught at the 7 and returned to the 19. Why’d Holley decide to punt so deep in SWO territory? “There ain’t a whole lot in the play book in (that situation),” he said. “Maybe pin them down and try to keep some field position because the defense was playing solid. Little out of range for field goal. ... So we went quick kick.” As it turned out, the move worked. East Duplin held Southwest to a three-and-out and got the ball back at the SWO 49. But the Stallions then held the Panthers to a three-and-out as well. Improving Southwest Holley wasn’t sure what would happen Friday night when the Panthers invaded The Corral, but he knew one thing for sure after it was over. Page 2 of 3 - “I didn’t know what to expect. You see them on tape and you can tell they’ve got a big front and the guys got that tradition and they ain’t going to go down without fighting,” he said. “They’re a lot better football team than they were when they started. That’s a tribute to them guys that they keep working. “It was a good game. I knew they were much improved team and knew it was going to be a fight. Good tradition, guys going to play hard and they played hard and we played hard. It was a good football game.” And a big win? “All of them are big,” he replied. “Like I told the kids, we’ll take it anyway we can. I told them it was going to be a four-quarter ballgame when we got here. All week we’ve been telling them it was going to be a four-quarter ballgame.” Big game at Northside Not many perhaps would have expected Croatan’s game at Northside next Friday to play a big part in deciding this year’s East Central 2-A Conference champion. But it may very well end up that way as when the Cougars visit the Monarchs in a game featuring Croatan’s up-and-coming program against Northside – the four time defending ECC champion. But when asked his initial thoughts on Croatan followed the Monarchs’ 27-0 home win over Dixon, Northside coach Bob Eason was a man of few words. “Every game is big for us,” he said. Moments later, Eason was pressed to elaborate, even being guided by asking if he felt Croatan would give Northside a good game. “Yeah,” he said. Some streak Northside has won 15 straight over Croatan, with its only loss to the Cougars coming in the Monarchs’ first football season in 2001. That year, Croatan won 35-14. Since then, it’s been all Northside – in a big, big way. During the 15-game winning streak, the Monarchs have beaten Croatan by an average of 26 points. Only three games have been decided by less than nine points while nine were won by 21 points or more. Twice, the Monarchs beat Croatan twice in a season – once during the regular and then again in the playoffs. That happened in 2012 and again last year, beating the Cougars 28-19 in the regular season and 31-20 in the first round of the 2-A playoffs. He finally got one Northside senior defensive lineman Bernard Cooks got what he’s wanted for a very long time: a touchdown. Page 3 of 3 - The dream of finding the end zone came to fruition with Northside leading Dixon 7-0 in the second quarter when he stripped quarterback Brandon Horsley and ran 30 yards for a touchdown. “That was my No. 1 goal,” Cooks said. And Eason was glad Cooks achieved it. “Good for him,” the coach said. “He’s a senior, he’s done a great job and I’m proud of him because he works hard.” Offensive adjustment? Nah Eason said his team will still look to throw the ball, despite the absence of its top two receivers – one with an injury and other who is no longer on the team because he’s not eligible. Against Dixon, the Monarchs struggled early through the air, but made some plays via the pass in the second half. “We still have guys who can catch and we can still throw it,” Eason said. “The problem tonight (on offense) was that we were taking one step forward and two steps back with penalties.” By Rick Scoppe and Chris Miller-JDNsports@JDNews.com The Daily News By Rick Scoppe and Chris Miller-JDNsports@JDNews.com Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 2:45 PM Updated at 2:46 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:08:39.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
