It was Saturday night. Junior Tyler Kelleher, sophomore Andrew Poturalski and senior Dan Correale had the chemistry going early. They combined for four goals and six assists as the Wildcats rallied for a 7-3 win over American International in their season opener   Kelleher, who led UNH in points and assists last year, had two goals and two assists, including the go-ahead strike on a nifty backhand feed from Correale that gave the Wildcats a 3-2 lead at 8:51 of the second period. “I just kind of went to the net to be honest,” Correale said. “I heard his voice. He was back door and I just put it there. He doesn’t miss those too often.” Six players scored for UNH (1-0). Poturalski had a goal and three assists and Correale added   UNH fell behind twice (1-0 and 2-1), but quickly erased the deficit each time. With the Wildcats trailing 2-1 early in the second period, freshman defenseman Matt Dawson scored his first career goal to tie the game 14 seconds after the Yellow Jackets had taken their second lead. “For a 7-3 game there was a lot of stress,” said UNH coach Dick Umile. “I was not happy with the way we played, especially the first two periods. We got the win, but we’ve got a lot of work to do.” Kelleher and Correale followed suit with Correale converting a nice pass from Poturalski with 4:15 remaining   UNH outshot AIC, 33-29, and Danny Tirone finished with 26 saves. Leading 5-3, the Wildcats scored twice in the final 1:15, topped by Poturalski’s first of the year with less than a second left. “We had great chemistry,” Kelleher said. “Coming off last year we had a good end to the year and we’re just trying to ride it into this year.” The teams were tied 1-1 after one period. AIC scored first on a goal by Austin Orszulak at the 7:35 mark, but the Wildcats pulled even less than four minutes later on Kelleher’s first of the season when he a took a feed from Poturalski in the right circle, cut in front and beat goalie Alex Murray with a backhander. “They’re very noticeable out there,” AIC coach Gary Wright said of the Wildcats’ top line. “We were certainly aware of them. They’re fast in transition and they move the puck very quickly.” Dawson also assisted on the play for his first career point. AIC’s Bryant Christian put the Yellow Jackets up, 2-1, at 2:03 of the second period, but it was all UNH after that. Kelleher almost had a hat trick, but was denied by Murray on a breakaway   “They can score goals,” Umile said, “but you’ve got to play defense too. We didn’t play as well when we didn’t have the puck as I believe we can play. We’ll work on that this week for sure.” Sophomore Jason Salvaggio scored his first career goal on a set-up from Michael McNicholas that made it 5-2 at 7:03 of the third period. “That (top) line in particular was impressive,” Wright said, “but it felt like wave after wave of pretty skilled players.” AIC closed to within two on an unassisted goal by Johno May with 8:35 to play. Senior Maxim Gaudreault scored an empty net goal from the neutral zone with 1:15 remaining, and Poturalski converted a centering pass from Kelleher to make it 7-3 with less than a second left. “We’ve got play better defense,” Umile said. “They’re getting behind us and we’re allowing shots from the slot with nobody on them. “It’s a W,’” he added. “We’ll take it, but we’ve got a lot of work to do.” “I don’t think we played our best game tonight,” Kelleher said, “but it’s nice to get a win.” By Al Pike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:30:10.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
