Leonard Fournette is set to pass Bo Jackson's rushing numbers for the second straight season. Fournette gained more yards as a freshman (1,034 to 829) and now has almost as many as a sophomore—and he's only halfway through the season. Fournette has 1,202 yards this year and needs just 12 more yards to pass Jackson's sophomore year total of 1,213. \n-- When did I know LSU had the game won? In the first half. Why? LSU is now 13-0 against Florida since 1977 when the Tigers score more than 21 points. On the other hand, Florida has now lost 4 times in the last 9 years against LSU when the Gators have scored more than 21 points. Higher-scoring shootouts against the Gators favor LSU. \n-- What happened to LSU's game plan in the third quarter ? How does Brandon Harris throw for 189 yards in the first half — and just four yards in the third quarter? LSU's offense collected three-and-outs like Toronto's David Price was pitching. \n-- DB-Who? For all of that pre-game chatter about Florida challenging LSU's claim to having the school most recognized for defensive backs (DBU), neither secondary shut down anybody. Both QBs threw for more than 200 yards, each team had a 100-yard receiver, and game-changing pass plays abounded for both teams. \n-- Have I stat-nerded you out yet? One more nugget: Beside this season , only once since 1929 has LSU won its first five games and scored at least 44 points in three of those wins. The other time: the 2007 national championship season. \n-- Does it feel good to be an American? The American Athletic Conference's three undefeated teams remained so after unranked Memphis knocked off No. 13 Ole Miss , and No. 24 Houston and unranked Temple also won. Could the American have 3 teams ranked in the Top 25 this week? \n-- Can you imagine how the Michigan punter feels? Poor Blake O'Neill made a two-fold mistake in Michigan's loss to Michigan State; first a physical error in dropping the ball and then a mental one in trying to still kick it away. Unfortunately, he combined a Jackie Smith with a Garo Yepremian. As the announcer in the clip below says of Smith, who dropped a Super Bowl touchdown, \"Bless his heart.\" \n7 Wonders archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:52:44.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
