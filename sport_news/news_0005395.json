By the end of business Monday, the Nets will have to shed two contracts.\nWith 13 players already holding fully guaranteed contracts, the decision likely will come down to a choice between the four players with non-guaranteed or partially guaranteed deals: Donald Sloan, Willie Reed, Dahntay Jones and Justin Harper.\nThe player most likely to claim one of those spots is Sloan. After Ryan Boatright was cut last week, he is the third point guard on the roster behind Jarrett Jack and Shane Larkin, and it would be a major surprise if the Nets chose to go into the regular season with just two point guards.\nThat would leave the final roster spot to go to either Reed, Harper or Jones — each of whom brings something different.\nHeading into training camp, Reed appeared to be the frontrunner to make the roster after getting a $500,000 guarantee from the Nets this summer following impressive play with the Heat’s entry in the Orlando Summer League. But Reed suffered a quad strain on the first day of training camp this month, and then tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his right thumb after playing five minutes against the Celtics on Oct. 14 — his only action of the preseason.\nReed had surgery Oct. 16, and will be out for at least the first month of the regular season. That, combined with rookie Chris McCullough being out indefinitely rehabbing from knee surgery, leaves the Nets with just four healthy big men if they choose to keep Reed. And while that is enough, one of those is Andrea Bargnani — who has missed all six preseason games because of a tight left hamstring, and who only returned to full practice Friday and Saturday.\nAll of the injuries the Nets have dealt with this month on the frontline, however, opened the door for Harper — who stepped right through and played well, averaging 9.0 points, 4.7 rebounds and shooting 9-for-19 from 3-point range while being the only Net to participate in all six preseason games. He even started the preseason finale in Boston when the Nets left Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young at home, and earned praise from coach Lionel Hollins for his play.\nJones’ path to a roster spot seems more tenuous. On a team already with six guaranteed contracts for wing players, the injury situation among the bigs would make it difficult to keep Jones without cutting or trading one of those players with a guaranteed deal. But Jones, who played for the Grizzlies when Hollins was an assistant there, also has received praise from Hollins throughout the preseason, and would give the Nets another veteran presence on the bench — which is something they surprisingly lack after the veteran-laden rosters they have had the past three seasons.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brooklyn nets ,  donald sloan ,  justin harper ,  willie reed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:57:18.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
