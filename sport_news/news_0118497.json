Auburn junior Emma Lai and senior Meghan Mediratta just missed a chance to become even bigger surprises. The sectional runners-ups may have come within one point of sailing into the fourth round unbeaten. They lost 4-6, 7-6 (12-10), 6-1 in the second round to 8-16 seed Oni Jones and Camryn Salter of Chicago Whitney Young, who won their other two matches 6-0, 6-0 and 6-0, 6-1. “They really kept the ball in play and made the other team make mistakes,” Auburn coach Tracy Palmer said. “We just couldn’t find a way to win.” Lai and Mediratta had three match points in the second set, but couldn’t win any of them, and then were eliminated two matches later in consolation play. “It was exciting, but we got tight toward the end,” Lai said. “When we first started, it was very relaxed. We had nothing to lose. But once we were up and had proven ourselves so far, it was, ‘We don’t want to lose now.’” Doubles teams from Guilford, Boylan and Hononegah are the only NIC-10 players left after the first of three days of state tennis. Barr and Custer went 3-1 and survived a gut-check of their own in their third-round consolation match. They were up 5-3 in the second set before losing four games in a row, but kept it together to beat Morton’s Courtney Byrne and Laynie Laktas 6-3, 5-7, 10-8. “That match was something else,” Boylan coach Steve Price said. “They stayed mentally tough. That was the big thing.” Custer had never won a match in her two earlier trips to state. “I went in just wanting to win one match. Winning three and making it to the second day is the best feeling ever,” she said. “It was really hard to come back in that third set,” Barr said, “but we pushed through it. It’s super satisfying.” Sectional champs Carly Kasicki and Nicole Christensen of Guilford were the only local players to make it to the third round, but then lost 6-0, 6-3 to Barrington’s Anna Donoghue and Nidhi Jha. They said they tried to step up their game a little too much against a seeded team. “We were trying to be a little too aggressive,” Kasicki said. “We tried to go for some shots that we weren’t quite ready for yet. We wanted to get the point done with and rushed ourselves.” Page 2 of 2 - “You feel that if you don’t go for that shot,\" Christensen said, \"the other team is going to hit a better shot and put it away on you.\" Hononegah’s Meghan Davis and Erin Zanolla lost in the first round, but then won three consolation matches to stay alive. Boylan sophomore Ana Hatfield, a two-time conference and sectional champ, finished 2-2 in singles for the second year in a row and was eliminated. “It stinks, but now I know what to improve on,” Hatfield said. “I need to be more consistent, hit more topspin and not double-fault.” Hononegah’s Reagan Wells and the Belvidere North doubles team of Leraaen Abbott and Kayla Vittore both finished 1-2, while Lutheran’s Kaitlyn Larson and Freeport’s Andrea Case went 0-2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:50:26.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
