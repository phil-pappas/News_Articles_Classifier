Last Meeting at Clemson: Clemson won 24-14 Streak: Clemson won 4 in row, 6 of 7 \nWHEN BOSTON COLLEGE HAS THE BALL \nWe don’t know who will be playing quarterback for Boston College Saturday, but my best guess is Jeff Smith. Starter Darius Wade suffered a fractured left ankle in the second quarter of a 14-0 loss to Florida State on Sept. 18th. Since then, the job has been a platoon of redshirt freshman Troy Flutie and true freshman Smith. Neither player has gained separation, and the Eagles have scored just seven points in three ACC games. Flutie is the better passer – he’s 20-of-37 for 336 yards – while Smith is just 9-of-30 for 86 yards. However, Smith is the team’s leading rusher with 38 carries for 257 yards and runs the read-option better. Running back Tyler Rouse is the second-leading rusher with 54 carries for 240 yards. The Eagles could see the return this week of running back Myles Willis, who has been out since early September. Willis is from Conyers (GA) and had a 38-yard touchdown run two years ago for his first collegiate score. Back to the passing game – Clemson has seven receivers with six or more catches and the leader has 29 ( Artavis Scott Artavis Scott #3 5-10, 191Oldsmar, FL View Full Profile ). Boston College has just three receivers in that category and two have six catches while leader Bobby Woolford has eight. The Eagles will need to see if they can solve Clemson’s front seven and run the ball enough to open up some kind of passing lanes down the field. Right now, no matter who is at quarterback, that doesn’t look likely. \nADVANTAGE: CLEMSON \nWHEN CLEMSON HAS THE BALL \nThe Tigers have scored at least 20 points in all five games—something the Eagles defense has yet to allow an opposing offense to accomplish. How good has Boston College’s defense been? The Eagles defense ranks in the Top 5 in seven categories: total defense (first), pass defense (first), rush defense (first), opponent first downs (first), opponent third down conversions (first), scoring defense (second), tackles for loss (fourth) and opponent red zone conversions (fifth). BC has held seven consecutive regular-season opponents to 10 or fewer points in the first half. The Eagles haven't allowed more than four third-down conversions in six-straight regular-season games, holding opponents to just 17-of-95 on such conversions during that span. Sophomore defensive lineman Harold Landry ranks tied for 12th in the nation with 9.5 tackles for loss, and the Boston College defense has not allowed a touchdown in 10 quarters. \nHowever, the totals have come against Maine (FCS), Howard (FCS), Northern Illinois (55th nationally), Duke (57th nationally) and Florida St. (47th). \nSomething will have to give Saturday against a Clemson offense that found itself last week in ringing up over 500 yards of total offense against Georgia Tech. The Tigers will likely use Scott on the jet sweep to the outside while hammering Wayne Gallman Wayne Gallman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:22:15.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
