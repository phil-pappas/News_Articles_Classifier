Dean Lewington was booked for bringing down Mark Little to halt one of several dangerous raids.A late challenge by Jake Forster-Caskey on Reid brought a yellow card in the 29th minute and sparked an angry reaction from City's players. Aden Flint was also booked for getting involved in the melee.The hosts should have been further ahead by the break when a strong run and pass from Kodjia set up Luke Freeman but he sent his shot from 12 yards into the crowd behind the goal.Kodjia then broke down the left again, collected Marlon Pack's pass and cut in to have a fierce right-footed shot saved by Martin.The interval arrived without City goalkeeper Frank Fielding having made a save. The Dons' approach play promised better, but lacked an incisive final pass.Reeves finally tested Fielding with a fierce left-footed shot from inside the box, which was tipped wide for a corner.With the visitors enjoying their best period, a Lewington cross from the right was just missed by striker Simon Church and the ball bounced against the far post with Fielding beaten.City had lost their way and Fielding had to make a fine diving save from substitute Rob Hall when he let fly from 25 yards.Steve Cotterill's men were looking tired as they faced wave after wave of attacks, hardly able to get out of their own half in the closing stages.Their back-line defended valiantly but the pressure had to tell and Powell sent the visiting fans wild with a goal that was worthy of taking a point from a game his side might feel they should have won.
