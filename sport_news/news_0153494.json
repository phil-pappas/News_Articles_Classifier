Digital sales have doubled from last year and online games have nearly tripled. Quote: Our goal was simple, make NBA 2K16 the most playable, authentic basketball experience ever, said Greg Thomas, president of Visual Concepts. The development team demonstrated tremendous dedication to recreating every nuance of the sport both on and off-court, which has been the driving force behind our early success. Congratulations to 2K Sports on their early record-breaking success with NBA 2K16, said Matt Holt, NBA vice president, global merchandising. Each year, 2K has continued to raise their commitment to innovation, authenticity and gameplay - bringing fans the very best with the NBA 2K franchise. # 1 Impetuous65 @ 10/02/15 08:11 AM Congrats VC # 2 tsbmolina @ 10/02/15 08:25 AM Simply amazing and well deserved. People were calling me crazy when I said the NBA 2k series was just as financially important as the Grand Theft Auto franchise for Take-Two http://www.operationsports.com/forum...to-series.html It doesn't sound so far fetched now, does it? NBA 2k16 will sell 10 million copies as I predicted before it's release. Congratulations 2K! # 3 Dazraz @ 10/02/15 08:31 AM Invest, put in the hard work & the rewards will come. Much deserved. Every Developer of any sports game needs to look to this game as a reference point. NBA 2K16 should be the standard in sports games not the exception. # 4 ataman5 @ 10/02/15 08:33 AM Congratulations hope you keep it up!

I've basically forgot I had a girlfriend for the last few days. # 6 Mauer4MVP @ 10/02/15 08:42 AM Well deserved with such a great game. I don't mean to imply 2k was lazy before, just going to say that this is what happens when their is some form of competition. # 7 Sinner @ 10/02/15 08:43 AM Damn that's nice, congrats to all that worked on the game. Definitely well deserved, I'm enjoying the hell out of so many parts of the game. Loving it.

Still, many, many occurring and recurring problems to be proud of this tbh. Still a great, great game. but too many little issues that are extremely nagging. If I play-tested this game, I would have changed more than 10 very obvious issues/miscues. # 9 Lakers 24/7 @ 10/02/15 08:54 AM Awesome to hear, but please use that to upgrade the servers to keep those players coming back. # 10 ksuttonjr76 @ 10/02/15 08:57 AM Well deserved. I've haven't been getting my proper sleep due to this game. I'm getting like 4 hours of sleep per night... But if I could go without sleep I would, lol. # 11 kadzier @ 10/02/15 08:58 AM maybe the server problems are because they had no idea it would sell so much anyway this is definitely among the most realistic simulations of a sport on the market, so well deserved. the madden guys should take note # 12 The 24th Letter @ 10/02/15 08:58 AM Yeah, this needs to be posted every time someone gives a \"this is why 2k is falling off\" rant when they don't like something, lol Great job on the game fellas, keep up the good work, keep in touch with the community and keep on putting out a quality product... Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk # 13 cthurt @ 10/02/15 09:08 AM They deserve every penny, my only issue with this game is that I will from now on compare other sports games to 2k16, and that isn't fair to other games, this game really feels like my first next gen sports gaming experience. # 14 zrohman @ 10/02/15 09:10 AM Not to mention they probably got $10 or more in VC already off of half of those people, and many bought the Jordan edition. .. can you say # 15 jeremym480 @ 10/02/15 09:16 AM Quote: Originally Posted by jeebs9 4 Million Damn Nice job guys.
