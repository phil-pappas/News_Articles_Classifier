Huntingdon cornerback Brendon Brown intercepted two passes in last weekend's win at Belhaven. Stacy Long \nThere was one spot he just had to visit after he made his second interception during Huntingdon’s win last weekend at Belhaven. \nHe paused to scan for his prey and proceeded in that direction. Oh, yes, receiver Jamichael Bibb saw him coming. \n“I just walked up to him and looked at him,” Brown said. “I didn’t say a word. \n“Oh, he got the message. He got the message pretty clearly.” \nThe two are longtime friends, enough that Bibb had regularly teased Brown, a defensive back, over his — shall we say — stone-handed prowess. \nBrown had two interceptions last year for the Hawks, but there should have been more. \nOne miss clanged his facemask with such force that it still rings in his ears. Mainly from Bibb reminding him of it. \n“He got on me a lot last year,” said Brown, a Jeff Davis High graduate. “After that game (at Belhaven), he said, ‘You should have more.’” \nThough one of his two at Belhaven set up a touchdown, Brown’s next goal: return one for a score. His next chance: Saturday’s homecoming game against North Carolina Wesleyan. \n“One of his interceptions was a dadgum good one, too,” said running back John Iwaniec, who ran for four scores in the 35-21 win. “I was like, ‘Oh, my.’ \n“That gave us some momentum, and we scored on that drive. It gave us a big lift.” \nBrown’s 24-yard return gave Huntingdon the ball at the Belhaven 38 and led to a Lorenzo James touchdown. His other interception came in the first quarter in the end zone. \n“He made two pretty good plays at big times in the game,” Huntingdon coach Mike Turk said. “Turnovers are always big, but you could feel those on the scoreboard.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1KOlreq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:11:32.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
