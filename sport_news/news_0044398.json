Nevarez followed in 15:48, along with Xavier Prep’s David Stabile (15:52), Indio’s Mario Salazar (15:58) and Xavier Prep’s Alex Rose (16:05). \nAfter spending most of the first DVL race jostling for position with Xavier Prep’s David Stabile, Barrera said he felt much more comfortable in the top spot Wednesday. Consequently, he wasn’t really challenged much after the first few minutes. \n“I felt more relaxed, actually,” he said. “The last race, I collapsed afterwards because I was so tired, but this race I finished really happy.” \nIndio coach Santiago Briones came into Wednesday’s race a bit uncertain of where his boys would finish after taking first handily three weeks ago. In a race both Xavier Prep and the Rajahs ran at Stanford just days after the first DVL race, Briones said the Saints edged out the Rajahs in total racing time between the two squads, proving the Saints certainly shouldn’t be considered out of the DVL race. \n“We knew we had our hands full coming into today ... We knew Xavier Prep was going to come out guns blazing,” Briones said. “I was very pleased with how they performed today.” \nBriones said that this season he’s experienced some trial and error as a coach, trying to figure out the best training regimen for a varsity group that contains freshmen and seniors alike, but it appears things are finally falling into place. \n“We have such a diverse group of kids when it comes to age,” Briones said. “Some are more mature than others physically, so it’s been about trying to find the right amount of recovery and the right workload to keep them healthy and keep their mindset where it needs to be.” \nAnd Wednesday’s performance showed him his boys have no plan of giving up that top spot in the DVL anytime soon. \n“We’ve progressed a lot compared to the last DVL race ... I feel really confident in my team going on,” Barrera said. “Now it’s our turn to start a new streak, and I’m proud to be a part of that.” \nIndividual results \n1. Luis Barrera (I): 15:31 \n2.
