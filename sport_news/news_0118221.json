Solo was charged with two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault. She pleaded not guilty.\nA municipal judge dismissed the case in January, but prosecutors — in a rare move — appealed that decision. The appeals court sent it back to the lower court Friday.\n\"We are shocked and disappointed by the judge’s ruling this morning. However, we maintain our position that the charges in this case should have never been filed, that the original trial court’s dismissal of the case was correct, and we plan to file an appeal of today’s decision with the Court of Appeals,\" Solo’s attorney, Todd Maybrown, said in a statement.\nSolo was on the U.S. team that won the Women’s World Cup in Canada this summer. The 34-year-old Washington native was named the Golden Glove winner as the tournament’s best goalkeeper, allowing just three goals overall with five shutouts and going for a record 540-minute span without conceding a goal.\nShe is a 15-year veteran of the senior national team, holding U.S. records for most wins (138) and shutouts (89) over 180 appearances.\nFollowing her arrest in 2014, there was an outcry over U.S. Soccer’s decision to allow her to remain on the team while the assault case played itself out.\nSolo has always claimed that she was defending herself against her 6-foot-8, 280-pound, 17-year-old nephew.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:40:58.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
