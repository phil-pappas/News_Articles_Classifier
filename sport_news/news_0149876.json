I’m with the perfect crowd.\nAnd the funny thing is, the Patriots are not as good as last year’s Super Bowl-winning team. Not yet anyway.\nSo why go all in and endorse running the table on the 2015 season? Why entertain 2007 happening once again?\nFor me, it comes down to two significant reasons.\nFirst, as suggested above, Tom Brady is definitely into it. As former Patriot great Rodney Harrison told the Herald, Brady’s on an “all-year assault.” He’s not going to let up during the year, not for one second. He’s in it, to win it big every week.\nSecond, the schedule favors it happening. It’s nowhere near as tough as last year’s backbreaker. This is a walk in the park, comparatively.\nPrior to yesterday’s games, only four teams of those remaining on the schedule had winning records. More to the point, is there a quarterback left who scares you?\nOne of the biggest reasons for arguing against the perfect season would be not having as good a secondary as last season, when you could foil the great quarterbacks, and shut down offenses with cornerbacks Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner.\nWell, Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay isn’t on the schedule. Neither is Carson Palmer and that crew out in Arizona.\nSo what quarterback and what offense left on the Patriots schedule makes you nervous? Perhaps the better way to look at it, is there anyone on the schedule Brady can’t outscore?\nIs it Indy’s Andrew Luck? Because he’s going to have to score at least 50, and he hasn’t cracked Belichick’s defense yet.\nIs it Denver’s Peyton Manning, who clearly has lost his fastball, and now relies on throwing Eephus pitches to his receivers?\nOr might former Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien, with former Brady backups Ryan Mallett and Brian Hoyer, have the secret to spoiling the perfect season in Houston? Maybe Mallett and Hoyer could occasionally beat Brady tossing footballs into a bucket, which was a fun exercise at practice, but it’s doubtful they’ll beat him in a real game.\nObviously, the longer the Pats remain undefeated, the tougher it becomes to stay that way. The challenges becomes greater. We saw that in 2007. Teams will find better ways to defend Brady and the offense. With the benefit of film from early in the season, they’ll be more prepared and get more creative in trying to stop them.\nDown the stretch in 2007, that’s when the games were the most difficult. But they survived regular-season close calls with the Eagles, Ravens and, finally, the Giants.\nFor this team, the most worrisome games come Week 10 and Week 11. The first is a date in East Rutherford, N.J. with the Giants. Their offense could be bothersome, especially with Odell Beckham Jr. and Victor Cruz, if the latter is healthy. Of course, Eli Manning has beaten the Pats twice in Super Bowls, and Giants coach Tom Coughlin has a terrific 5-1 head-to-head record against Belichick.\nBut the Brady factor trumps this. As long as he has tight end Rob Gronkowski and wide receiver Julian Edelman, and all three remain healthy, they’ll roll against the Giants.\nThe next opponent arrives in Foxboro on Monday, Nov. 23, when Rex Ryan and the Bills get another shot at the Pats.\nThe Bills probably will have learned a lesson from the first game and not be so crazy getting penalties. Or not. The Pats will have their hands full here, but once again, should prevail.\nThe only other tough spot might be in Denver (Week 12), but not because of Manning, but because of the Broncos defense is playing extremely well.\nLet’s just say there doesn’t appear to be a defense Brady can’t solve at the moment. From the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl, where he picked apart a Seattle unit that was arguably the best defense in football, through the first three games of the 2015 season, he’s been crazy good.\nThe odds, of course, are against it happening. Perfect seasons are few and far between. This just feels too much like 2007. It feels like an unspoken quest. That’s why you can count me in.\nOn to 16-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:44:17.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
