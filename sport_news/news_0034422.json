He said if flare-related law changes are required, he is prepared to do so. \nVictoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton told local radio: \"There's a big increase in the amount of flares being let off at these events, and they are an ugly blight and dangerous to people.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:29:00.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
