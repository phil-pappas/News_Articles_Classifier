(Jamie Sabau/Getty Images) \nTHE INFO \nWho: Terps (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) vs. Penn State (5-2, 2-1) When: Saturday, 3:30 p.m. Eastern Where: M&T Bank Stadium, Baltimore TV: ESPN DMV radio: ESPN 980 (980 AM), WJZ (101.9 FM) Satellite radio: Sirius Channel 134, XM Channel 201 Coaches: Terps – Mike Locksley (first season, 0-0); Nittany Lions– James Franklin (second season, 12-8) Series: Penn State leads, 35-2-1 \nTHE QUESTIONS \n[ Locksley’s second shot at head coach is as Maryland’s caretaker ] \nLocksley has described the two weeks since Randy Edsall’s firing as a “whirlwind,” but he has focused on lightening the mood in practice to get the most out of his players. The bye week certainly helped Maryland’s staff make the transition. Tactically, not much will change Saturday – Locksley will still handle most of the play-calling but will relegate some of that responsibility to tight ends coach John Dunn. The defensive coaching staff has had a minor shift with the departure of assistant Lyndon Johnson, but Keith Dudzinksi said this week that the unit is “making it work.” \nWill Perry Hills remain productive? \nLocksley has built his game-plan around the dual-threat ability of Hills , who took control of the starting quarterback job again after accounting for 303 yards against Ohio State two weeks ago. Hills said this week that he was more comfortable with Maryland’s game plan against the Buckeyes, which featured a heavy dose of zone-read option plays and gave the quarterback a green light to freelance with his legs. Expect Maryland’s offense to loosen up even more Saturday – it could feature Wildcat situations with fullback-turned-quarterback Shane Cockerille, even defensive back Will Likely is expected to see the field in certain situations – but Hills’s performance will be at the forefront. Penn State has the fourth-rated defense in the Big Ten, allowing just 297.6 yards per game. \nCan Maryland contain Saquon Barkley? \nThe true freshman went off for 194 yards on 26 carries last week against Ohio State , carrying a Penn State offense that sits second to last in the Big Ten with 339.7 yards per game. Only Maryland and Northwestern have less productive pass offenses – Nittany Lions quarterback Christian Hackenberg threw just 13 times last week against the Buckeyes – but Barkley has been a revelation. He’s averaging 8.3 yards per carry and faces a Maryland defense that has been leveled with injuries in recent weeks. “We have to do a great job of fitting the gaps and tackling well,” Dudzinski said. “He’s a guy you can’t just arm tackle. You have to get up there and get your shoulder on him and get the rest of the guys to rally. He can make you miss and then he can hit the home run as well.” \nTHE STATS \n34.7: Points allowed per game by Maryland, which ranks second to last in the Big Ten. \n172.2: Yards passing per game by Penn State QB Christian Hackenberg. \n170: Rushing yards for Perry Hills against Ohio State, the most all-time by a Maryland quarterback. \n10.5: Tackles per game for Maryland LB Jermaine Carter Jr., which ranks second in the Big Ten. \nTHE QUOTES \nLocksley on Penn State playing in Baltimore: “Right now, I feel really good about the energy of our team. We’re coming off our first really big work day today, the guys were moving around pretty well. I noticed that they’re excited about the opportunity to go play up in Baltimore this week in front of our Baltimore fan base. We’re going to face a really good Penn State team, a team that Coach [James] Franklin has planned pretty well.” \nLB Jermaine Carter Jr. on comparing Barkley to Ohio State star Ezekiel Elliott: “I feel like he may be just as good.” \nHills on absorbing big hits after running 25 times against Ohio State: “As a quarterback you can always slide or go out of bounds. Growing up I was always taught to fight for the extra yard. If I have to get an extra yard to get the first down, I’m going to do that. I’m going to lower my shoulder and do what I have to do. If there are instances where I can slide to avoid a hit, I have to learn to do that.” \nTHE LINKS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:36:24.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
