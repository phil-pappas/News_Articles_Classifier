Leaves are awarded on a zero-to-five basis.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! \nOffense (3 leaves) It now looks like the red zone measures 100 yards long and 53 1/3 yards wide, and the guess here is that the Buckeyes will run faster and straighter with J.T. at the wheel. And Zeke Elliott makes any engine purr.\nDefense (4 leaves) The defense was victimized by some gashing again, but the fact it was a big-time running back made the smell seem not so foul. There’s no quibbling about allowing a mere 10 points, however.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nSpecial teams (4 leaves) Ohio State was more or less inept in the first and third quarters, but Cam Johnston barely gave Penn State room to breathe with booming and precision punting. Bonzer, mate. Jack Willoughby made a key field goal but sent no kickoffs to the end zone.\nCoaching (4 leaves) This grade may drop, retroactively, depending on who is named the starting QB on Monday. But in the heat of the moment, Urban Meyer realized his starter was a flat tire so he called in the spare. Regardless, the OSU attitude was as healthy as it’s been, in terms of playing to win.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \nFun quotient (4 leaves) Even the most staunch of traditionalists probably thought the all-black looked sweet. OK, maybe the scarlet buckeye leaves were a step too far. Still, they flock here to watch physical, winning football and a tight band, and the night provided all of that.\nOpponent (3 leaves) There are some real-deal Nittany Lions among the bunch, including smooth RB Saquon Barkley and defensive lineman Carl Nassib. Too bad neither can punt. QB Christian Hackenberg threw a few nice passes, but he was a beaten-up soldier by the time he trudged his body off the field.\nOfficiating (3 leaves) If video review didn’t show that Braxton Miller caught a key first-quarter pass with the aid of the turf, then what’s the point? Miss. Also curious was the call on Vonn Bell for talking trash, but refs did get the Camren Williams targeting call correct.\nrstein@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:35:57.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
