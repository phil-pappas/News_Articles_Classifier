Photo By Andrew Bruckse/Tennessee Athletics Andrew Bruckse/Tennessee Athleti Previous Next \nTennessee's fall softball season is a wrap and got good reviews from co-head coaches Ralph and Karen Weekly. \nThe Vols posted an 8-0 record with wins over Alabama-Huntsville, Tennessee Tech, Chipola, Lee University, Tennessee State, Shorter, Chattanooga State and Volunteer State by a combined score of 103-5. \nTennessee batted .440 and got production throughout the lineup with a mix of seven returning starters from the 2015 Women's College World Series team and a touted freshman class. \n\"We have a lot of confidence in our offense,\" Ralph Weekly said in a school release. \nSophomore shortstop Meghan Gregg had a team-high 16 RBIs. Senior catcher Lexi Overstreet also had a strong fall, batting .438. \nSix newcomers batted .375 or better. Brooke Vines, from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., led the team with a .640 batting average, 16 hits, 13 runs and two home runs. \n\"I saw a higher softball IQ in general from our freshman class,\" Karen Weekly said. \"They play with a lot of energy and confidence and they're all ready to compete for starting positions.\" \nThe stable of pitchers posted an ERA of 0.56. Freshmen Matty Moss and Bria Bush combined to go 6-0 and allowed only 11 hits in 23 innings. \nSeniors Erin Gabriel and Rainey Gaffin combined for 30 strikeouts in 25 2-3 innings. \n\"We're going to have five pitchers that are going to pitch at different times, so there's a possibility we could pitch a lot by committee as we did last year,\" Ralph Weekly said. \"We're going to have three seniors and two freshmen, so I feel pretty good about that.\" \nAdded Karen Weekly, \"We've improved quite a bit in our defensive play, which we needed to from last year.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:27:19.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
