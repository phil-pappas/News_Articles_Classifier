Asked about those complaints, Manfred denied that the Blue Jays were given earlier times slots because they are considered a poor draw by U.S. viewing audiences.\n\"Somebody had to play early today.\" Manfred said. \"We've got four games today, three hours windows, somebody has got to play in that early slot.\"\nAsked about plans to bring baseball back to Montreal, Manfred said he remains \"positive about the idea that Montreal is a viable major league market.\" However, the commissioner said there is \"not really anything new\" to report since he met with Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre in New York on May 28.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
