She dropped her serve again at 3-3 in the second set. \n“I didn’t expect it, but I believed I could make a good match,” said the 95th-ranked Mitu, who will next play Anna-Lena Friedsam of Germany. “It’s good to have such a tough match, as it makes you stronger for the rest of the tournament.” \nLast year’s runner-up Camila Giorgi defeated Julia Goerges of Germany 6-3, 6-4 in a match between two former finalists. The sixth-seeded Italian, who also beat Goerges here in straight sets two years ago, saved all six break points against her serve. \nFifth-seeded Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia pulled out because of a viral illness and was replaced by Johanna Konta of Britain, who defeated Anna Beck of Germany 6-1, 6-3. \nIn other first-round play, Madison Brengle of the United States beat Misaki Doi of Japan 6-0, 6-3; Alison van Uytvanck of Belgium defeated Lucie Hradecka of the Czech Republic 6-2, 7-5; and Stefanie Voegele of Switzerland beat Austrian wildcard entry Tamira Paszek 6-4, 7-5. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:53:40.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
