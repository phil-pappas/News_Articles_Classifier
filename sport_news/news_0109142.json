He took the mound with nothing under his short-sleeved No. 49 jersey to cover his arms — despite the thermometer reading 45 degrees at game time, and dropping. In what felt like football weather for Game 2 of the National League Championship Series, Arrieta resembled a tough-guy offensive lineman who leaves his biceps bare to brave the elements with as little layering as possible. Talk about being exposed.\nJake Arrieta on Daniel Murphy, 1st inning struggles Jake Arrieta on Daniel Murphy, 1st inning struggles.\nJake Arrieta on Daniel Murphy, 1st inning struggles.\nSee more videos \"The cold didn't bother me much,\" Arrieta said. \"I do my best to get the body ready, get hot and stay hot so the weather isn't much of a factor once the body gets heated up.\"\nStill, this goes down as a night Arrieta looked unprepared for the conditions, all of them, which had as much to do with hot Mets hitters as cold October temperatures. One game after $155 million man Jon Lester let the Cubs down, Arrieta disappointed the masses again with a disastrous first inning from which his team never recovered.\nAfter Arrieta's first pitch sailed ominously past Miguel Montero, which he blamed on the swirling wind blowing directly toward the pitcher's mound, he struggled to find a rhythm.\n\"It wasn't ideal,\" Arrieta said of his first fastball.\nNor was the first three Mets batters scoring. The third, Daniel Murphy, became the first player in Mets history to hit a home run in four straight playoff games. Around here, Murphy's bleachers refers to the right-field seats where the second baseman keeps depositing mistakes.\nKyle Schwarber: 'We're not going to panic' Kyle Schwarber: 'We're not going to panic.'\nKyle Schwarber: 'We're not going to panic.'\nSee more videos \"The turning point of the game,\" Arrieta called it.\nIt was obvious early to everybody in the crowd of 44,502 that Arrieta lacked the command that made him baseball's most dominant pitcher. The only thing familiar was the beard. The velocity of his pitches never reached 95 mph in the first inning, perhaps a product of throwing 248 2/3 innings — 92 more than he ever had in one season. For Arrieta's second straight postseason start, he gave up four runs in five innings and looked mortal enough to wonder how much stamina he has left.\n\"I can't deny that it might be (an issue),\" manager Joe Maddon said.\nThe man who carried the Cubs to this point needed a nudge that never came from an offense gone absent. Like Mets starter Matt Harvey in Game 1, right-hander Noah Syndergaard confused the Cubs, making a potent lineup powerless. The man nicknamed \"Thor,\" after the thunder god, shook the steadiest of Cubs hitters.\nSyndergaard's physical appearance, featuring long, flowing blond hair, looks fitting for the cover of a romance novel. His pitching, firing fastballs up to 99 mph, gives the Mets another young starter capable of rewriting the record books.\nThe night belonged to the tall 23-year-old Texan, who let his emotion show when pointing to right fielder Curtis Granderson after Granderson leaped high in the second to rob Chris Coghlan of a home run. Syndergaard struck out nine and gave up only three hits and a run in 5 2/3 innings.\n\"That's elite,\" Maddon said of Syndergaard's stuff.\nBut what happened to the lineup that rocked elite pitchers John Lackey and Gerrit Cole? Is it time to call in Simon the magician or a pink flamingo before Game 3 on Tuesday? How will Maddon react to the rare crisis of confidence on his brash young team? The Cubs went 7-0 against the Mets in the regular season but have yet to win the games that matter most or even pose a serious challenge in this series. Good pitching truly has beaten good hitting.\nOn a melancholy Monday in Chicago, Cubs fans will commiserate. Together, they will agonize and rationalize. They will wonder what happened to the real Jake Arrieta and why they ever allowed themselves to believe next year finally might be here on the North Side. They will cite a painful team history that remains irrelevant and see little hope for the near future.\nThey will overreact, every fan's right.\nIt will be like the city awoke in the middle of a bad baseball dream. But the reality is, the Cubs aren't done yet, and only a fool would say a team with such offensive firepower cannot come back from a 2-0 deficit. It seems like a good time to remind everybody counting out the Cubs that this series is best of seven, not five.\nAdmittedly, it looks bleak — especially with Cubs starters Kyle Hendricks and Jason Hammel unlikely to intimidate anybody in Games 3 and 4 at Wrigley Field. Especially with the Mets starting Jacob deGrom and his electric array of pitches Tuesday. But who knows what effect a familiar environment and unseasonably warm weather will have on Cubs hitters who couldn't escape New York fast enough? As the \"Rocky\" theme blared in the Cubs clubhouse, spirits remained high.\n\"We're looking for several one-game winning streaks,\" Maddon said. \"It's never going to be easy.\"\nSpeaking of difficulties, Maddon was asked before the game what he found to be the hardest thing about adapting to Chicago during his first season in town. Typically, he kept the mood light, describing the traffic from his downtown residence to Wrigleyville, complicated by the fact he insists on taking Clark Street instead of Lake Shore Drive because of his 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle.\n\"It was much more fun to shift it on Clark, so that was a big part of it,\" Maddon said.\nIf Maddon's team has another gear, now would be a good time to find it.\ndhaugh@tribune.com\nTwitter @DavidHaugh\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Jake Arrieta Chicago Cubs New York Mets Joe Maddon National League Championship Series", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56247afc/turbine/ct-kyle-schwarber-we-re-not-going-to-panic-20151018", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5624e5ed/turbine/ct-jake-arrieta-haugh-cubs-mets-nlcs-spt-1019-20151018", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56247662/turbine/ct-jake-arrieta-on-daniel-murphy-1st-inning-struggles-20151018"], "published": "2015-10-19T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:25:23.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
