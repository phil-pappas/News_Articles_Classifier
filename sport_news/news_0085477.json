It just got that much tougher for the Redskins against the Jets on Sunday. Here are a few things to watch for: \n\nInjuries \nPerhaps the biggest news of the week at Redskins Park is the injury report. Jay Gruden has ruled starting offensive lineman Trent Williams (concussion) and Kory Lichtenstieger (broken finger and shoulder) out for Sunday. Cornerback Chris Culliver (knee) is out along with tight end Jordan Reed (concussion) and cornerback DeAngelo Hall (toe). \nTrent Williams is the guy that this offensive line can’t afford to lose. Williams had what was classified as a neck injury this week, then Gruden said he developed a few headaches after Wednesdays practice so they played it safe with him. He’s now in the concussion protocol. Talk about a change of events. With Williams out, first-year tackle Ty Nsekhe will be making his first career NFL start this week. \nWide Receiver DeSean Jackson, running back Matt Jones and defensive end Stephen Paea are all listed as questionable. Getting Jackson back would be a huge lift to this offense. He’s been out since week one and with all the other injuries along the line and with Jordan Reed still out, Cousins could use a threat like him in the offense. \nJackson had a little setback on Thursday during practice so his status is “up in the air” according to Gruden. We’ll see how he feels on Sunday. \n\nThe return of Sheldon Richardson \nThe Jets defensive line was already one of the best in the league and now add Sheldon Richardson to that mix and it could be a long day for the Redskins offense. The Jets defense is tops in the league in giving up just 280 yards a game and 13.8 points per game. The Redskins will have Josh LeRibeus under center and first-year tackle Ty Nsekhe in place of Trent Williams. Running back Matt Jones injured his toe on the last play of the fourth quarter last week and is questionable. They will need to rely a lot on Chris Thompson out of the backfield this week. \n\nJets running game \nThe Jets like use a power run game and with Chris Ivory it’s worked pretty well. He’s averaging 5.0 yards a carry this year to go along with just three touchdowns. \nThe Redskins defensive line gave up its first 100 yard game to a running back last week. The group took it personal. Terrance Knighton and Jason Hatcher each took the blame for that and vowed to be better. \n“They’re a prideful group,” Defensive Coordinator Joe Barry said this week. \nTheir hands will be full once again on Sunday. \n\nTurnovers \nThe Redskins defense finally notched an interception last week, two of them to be exact. All in all though, after three turnovers the Redskins could only muster three points off those turnovers, something that every player to a man said has to be better this week. The Redskins have scored just three points off six turnovers and have allowed 34 points off of nine turnovers. The Jets on the other hand know how to take care of business when they force turnovers. They have scored 31 points off 13 turnovers while allowing only seven points off of seven. \n\nCousins \nWe talked about how beat up the Redskins offense is heading into the game. It’s important to watch Cousins this week and his consistency. We’ve seen the ups and downs this year from him. We’ve seen the 90-yard drive to beat Philadelphia and the :24 drive last week to tie the game, but we’ve also seen the pick-six to end the game in overtime. It will be important to see how he reacts this week when he could be forced to make quick decisions and lead this offense that will be missing a number of key pieces. \nThis is another important game on the road for this team, a place that hasn’t been kind to the Redskins. They have lost 15 of their last 16 away from Fed Ex Field. With Tampa Bay coming to town next week before the bye , this is a great opportunity for the Redskins to get back to .500 and put together a little streak. It’s not going to be easy. \n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP. All Rights Reserved.
