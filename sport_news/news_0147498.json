Jack's recovery timetable was projected at four-to-six months.\n\"I think it's very risky to do this,\" Mora told reporters after practice. \"There's a lot of speculation to where he is and where he fits.\"\nIn 2013, Jack was named the Pac-12's offensive and defensive freshman of the year after starring at both linebacker and running back. At 6-1, 245 pounds, he is one of the most versatile players in the country.\n\"He's taken his chips and he's shoving them into the middle,\" Mora said. \"We hope he draws a good hand.\"\nBut Mora is worried that scouts haven't seen enough of Jack, considering he's played barely more than two seasons.\n\"I've been in 25 draft rooms,\" Mora said. \"I've never seen a guy taken off (three games of junior tape).\"\nPer Scout.com, Jack was a four-star recruit for Bellevue coach Butch Goncharoff's controversial program. Coming out of high school, he was ranked the No. 4 outside linebacker in the country and No. 1 in the West. As a senior in high school, his Bellevue team went 14-0 and won the 3A WIAA state championship.\nPrior to the injury, Jack was projected as a first-round pick. He played in three games this season, totaling 15 tackles and an interception.\n\"Myles' talent is without question,\" Mora said. \"I hope he's put enough out there where they can get a true evaluation.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.uclabruins.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208818570"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:50:20.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
