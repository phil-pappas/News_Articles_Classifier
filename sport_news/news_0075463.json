We will have to be on top of our game to get a result,\" said the 33-year-old Spaniard. \n\"I am sure they were expecting more from the first two (Champions League) games and for Arsenal to have zero points is a surprise. \n\"However, even with zero points, Arsenal still have great players. If we don't control our game, we might have problems so we will be prepared.\" \nForward Thomas Muller stressed the need for focus. \n\"Away to Arsenal here, I doubt we are favourites, but of course our statistics of the past few months are great,\" said the German, who scored at the Emirates Stadium in both 2013 and 2014. \n\"However, Arsenal have quality and have shown it in the past few weeks. \n\"It will not be where one of the opponents park the bus in the goal, both teams will try to play offensively and it will be an open game.\" \nBayern will be without Holland winger Arjen Robben, who suffered a thigh injury on international duty. \nMidfielders Douglas Costa, Javi Martinez and forward Kingsley Coman have all travelled and will be assessed.
