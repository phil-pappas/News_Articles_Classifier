Omar, who is the grandson of first Prime Minister of J&K Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, blamed Pakistan for fudging facts regarding the UN resolutions on Kashmir. “Will someone please remind Pakistan that as per these UNSC resolutions, they were supposed to vacate ALL of J&K 1st,” he wrote on microblogging site Twitter. Omar said the sequence of the UNSC resolution of 1948 was clear that Pakistan had to secure withdrawal of invaders from all of Jammu and Kashmir. “The sequence is very clear — first Pakistan secures withdrawal of invaders. #UNSC Res 47 of 1948. Pak fudging facts,” he said. Omar made these marks while referring to the statement made by the Counsellor in Pakistan’s Permanent Mission to the UN, Bilal Ahmad, in which he cited various UN Security Council resolutions saying that they called for an impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the world body in accordance with the will of the Kashmiris. Meanwhile, Union Minister of State in PMO Jitendra Singh slammed the Pakistan Prime Minister for his remarks over the Kashmir issue and blamed the neighbouring country for “supporting, sponsoring and exporting” terrorism from its soil to India. Singh also said there was no outstanding issue between the two countries except that of retrieving back PoJK and Gilgit and Baltistan from the illegal occupation of Islamabad. “There is abundant evidence that it is Pakistan which is supporting, sponsoring and even exporting terrorism to India,” Singh told reporters on the sidelines of a function here. Rejecting Pakistan’s claim that human rights violations were taking place in J&K, Singh said there was ample evidence to show that violations were actually taking place in the areas occupied by Pakistan. “We live in an evidence-based era and, therefore, whatever is said by either side has to be supported with documents and evidence. Now, there is abundant evidence to show where actually the human right violation is happening,” he said. “Pakistan has been caught on camera indulging in human rights violation on the other side in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Gilgit and Baltistan,” he added. Singh said the global human rights bodies should come and see the ground reality as to where the violations were actually happening. Meanwhile, National Panthers Party patron Bhim Singh, while reacting to Minister for External Affairs Sushma Swaraj’s address at the UN General Assembly, said India missed a great chance to ask Pakistan to vacate parts of Jammu and Kashmir, including Gilgit and Baltistan, being illegally occupied by them. He said India “failed” once again to tell the international community about the illegal aggression that Pakistan committed against India and its illegal occupation of 32,000 sq miles of Indian territory since 1947 in spite of the UN resolution of August 13, 1948.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:18:08.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
