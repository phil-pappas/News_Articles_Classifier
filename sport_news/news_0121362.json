Wa-Hi’s Noelani Helm scored four aces and seven kills for the Blue Devils (2-10 record), along with her six digs and a block. Teammate Tara Krivoshein tallied an ace, two kills, 18 assists and nine digs, Emily Hedine was good for an ace, five kills and 19 digs, while Therese McCarty notched five kills and a block. “We all competed tonight, and we were missing three players, two of which have started the last three games,” McDaniels said. “I am proud of the girls for stepping up to the challenge and making Southridge earn it. Defense needed to be on point to take this match, and unfortunately we couldn’t string enough defensive plays together to take the Suns.” Wa-Hi’s Emma Wenzel contributed a pair of kills and two blocks, as Emily Dimino chipped in eight digs. The Blue Devils next play Tuesday at Richland, before hosting Kamiakin for the regular-season finale Thursday. “With two more games left and districts, anything can happen, its a just a matter of who is ready any given night,” McDaniels said. Pioneers rally to win at Baker BAKER — McLoughlin High School’s volleyball team rallied for its first win in the Greater Oregon League, beating Baker in five sets, 21-25, 25-21, 17-25, 25-23 and 15-10, on Thursday. “I am so proud of the ladies, they gave everything and were really on tonight,” Mac-Hi coach Amanda Nelson said. “They played a great game.” Delaney Karrels served four aces, scored two kills and set 34 assists for the Pioneers (1-5 record), while teammate Amber Wells tallied five kills and an ace with six blocks. Mac-Hi’s Shannon Carter notched two aces and 36 digs. The Pioneers wrap up their regular-season schedule Tuesday, when they host Dayton. W-M makes short work of Rockets ATHENA — Weston-McEwen won all three sets against Pilot Rock, 25-19, 25-18 and 25-21, in a Columbia Basin Conference volleyball match here Thursday. “I was pleased with how we finished each set,” TigerScots coach Shawn White said. “Each set was really competitive, so they had to be aggressive to win them.” Ali Schroeder set 27 assists and served an ace for Weston-McEwen (18-7 overall, 6-1 in the CBC), while Alyssa Finitrock scored three kills and made three blocks. The TigerScots’ Anna Gilsdorf recorded four kills and an ace, Bailey Hillmick tallied an ace and a dig, and Maddi Muilenburg notched three kills and three blocks. Weston-McEwen’s Sara von Borstel added nine kills, seven digs and three aces, Sarah Finifrock was good for 10 kills and two aces, Mati Aby 13 digs, and Tiah Benedict five digs. The TigerScots, second in the league, next play Saturday at Irrigon in a doubleheader against both Irrigon and first-place Culver. Bulldogs sweep past Irish DAYTON — The Dayton volleyball team overcame a tough opening set to beat DeSales in three, 25-20, 25-12 and 25-18, here Thursday in a Southeast 2B League match. Dayton improved its records to 9-3 overall and 7-2 in the league. “They played with a lot of intensity and played like that the whole match, they never let down,” Bulldogs coach Shannon Turner said. Dayton’s Josilyn Fullerton recorded nine kills, seven assists and six blocks, while Jenna Phillips was good on 21 serves out of 22 attempts. Phillips also made nine kills and nine blocks. Teammate Hannah Becker tallied 15 assists and three aces, Heidi Dobbs cleared all eight of her serves and Kaleigh White scored 11 kills. Meanwhile, DeSales (8-9, 4-4) came out challenging Dayton in the first set. “A couple of errors were given and we could’ve possibly have won that set,” Irish coach Ann Murray said. “But in a game against Dayton, there is no room for errors because we’ll be working twice as hard to come back.” DeSales senior outside hitter Amy Elmenhurst made 16 digs in her debut along the back row. She also made three blocks. Senior Teresa Acock switched from her home as libero to outside hitter and scored five kills with her 30 digs for the Irish, while senior outside hitter Cara Hall made seven kills. “(We) learned three new rotations this week due to key players we didn’t have with us and they adapted well, but it could have been one of the factors that was against us this game,” Murray said. The changes forced freshman Emily Hamada to step into the varsity middle from her normal spot on the right side. “She really is a clutch player that can adapt well to any position she is put in,” Murray said. The Irish next play Tuesday in a homecoming match against Asotin, while Dayton travels to Milton-Freewater. The Bulldogs play Walla Walla Valley Academy on Thursday. Touchet edges Tigercats in five KAHLOTUS — Touchet seemed to wage two battles Thursday, but the Indians managed to win their Southeast 1B volleyball match against Lacrosse-Washtucna/Kahlotus in five sets, 19-25, 25-20, 25-22, 14-25 and 15-12. “We fought ourselves all night,” Touchet coach April Miller said. “There were struggles all over the board, but thankfully we came away with the win. We had some highlights, but we’ve got to learn to get and keep momentum.” Touchet’s Abby Grudzinski had her best night of the season so far, as she scored six kills and made four blocks for the Indians (5-6 overall, 4-6 in the league). Teammate Rachel Miller tallied 17 kills and served six aces, Cierra Jo McKeown was good for 12 kills, 21 assists and three blocks, and Jennifer Aceves cleared all 17 of her serve attempts with a couple of aces, while making 17 digs. Touchet’s Paytyn Richartz chipped in 22 digs, and Katie Skramstad set 12 assists. Meanwhile, the Tigercats’ Britte Harder made four blocks and 22 digs, Nicole Harder served four aces and set 31 assists, and Jazzmyn Gordon notched four blocks and scored 12 kills. Touchet next plays Tuesday at home against Garfield-Palouse. Pirates sweep St. John-Endicott POMEROY — Pomeroy celebrated homecoming Thursday with a sweep of St. John-Endicott, 25-5, 25-10 and 25-19, in its Southeast 1B volleyball match. “That was the best defensive effort we’ve made all year,” Pirates assistant coach Adam Van Vogt said. “The girls were determined to not let anything hit the floor. It was fun to watch. “We also really kept a lot of pressure on them at the serving line.” Pomeroy’s Ally Bott scored 10 kills for the first-place Pirates (11-0 record), as Ireland Mayfield set 14 assists and made 11 digs, and Esther Schuh cleared 22 of her 22 serve attempts, including five aces. Teammate Kacey Halbert notched 10 digs. The Pirates next play Tuesday at Lacrosse-Washtucna.
