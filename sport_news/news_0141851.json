(Photo: PTI) New Delhi : Her dream academy almost ready, star Indian woman boxer MC Mary Kom cannot wait to roll out the red carpet for Prime Minister Narendra Modi for its inauguration, the only glitch being that the road leading upto the facility in Manipur is in shambles.\nThe 32-year-old had met Modi here in April and had invited him to inaugurate her dream project as and when it was to be ready in Langol village near Imphal.\nThe Prime Minister, on his part, had agreed to do the honours if his schedule permitted.\nThe land for this project — a total of 3.33 acre — was provided to her by the Manipur government after her London Olympic bronze medal and the work on the outdoor boxing hall and the gymnasium is set to be completed by the last week of this month.\nHowever, the road leading upto the academy is in such a bad shape that the boxer sought intervention of Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh for an early repair so that she can work out the date for inauguration, to be intimated to the Prime Minister's Office.\n\"I want the road leading upto the academy to be repaired before the inauguration as I am hoping that the Prime Minister will be coming to cut the ribbon. It is not for my personal gain, it is for all the youngsters who are looking to make a future in boxing through this academy,\" said Mary, who is training in Liverpool these days.\nThe five-time world champion is eyeing a November-end or December first week inauguration of the academy.\n\"As we are planning to inaugurate the newly-constructed gymnasium and outdoor boxing hall in the presence of the Hon'ble Prime Minister, I request you to kindly consider the matter and take it forward,\" Mary has said in a letter, dated October 20, to the Chief Minister.\nThe letter requesting for the repair of the road has been written by Mary Kom Regional Boxing Foundation's Secretary Jimmy Leivon and is also addressed to the state Chief Secretary.\n\"Hon'ble PM has assured his presence though there has been no confirmation on specific dates. Several inquiries have been made from the PMO on the status of the construction work,\" reads the letter to the CM and Chief Secretary.\n\"In this regard, I would like to fervently request hon'ble sir, on the behalf of the foundation and the local people here to kindly repair the road that connects the academy located at the National Games Village Langol from the capital city at the earliest before the commencement of the inauguration as the road is getting worse and is not in good condition for vehicles to ply,\" it adds.\n MC Mary Kom PM Narendra Modi Okram Ibobi Singh Boxing sports Manipur Also Read 'Mary Kom' may be declared tax free Asian Games: Magnificent Mary Kom packs a golden punch After out-witting Mary Kom, Pinki feels pressure of expectations I'm looking forward to bag another medal at Rio Olympics, I’m not turning pro: MC Mary Kom", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/TeluguMatrimony_Textlink_620x40px.gif", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151023/sports-other-sports/article/mary-kom’s-dream-academy-inauguration-rough-path", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Mary_1.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Mary_1.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:04:49.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
