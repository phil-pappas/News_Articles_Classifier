(USATSI) \nMiami had the spotlight early on Saturday, welcoming an undefeated Clemson team to town. The oddsmakers figured the Hurricanes could keep this game under a touchdown. Fans, and even some scribes, whispered about the possibility of an upset during the week. \nBut any hopes of a season-changing Canes win were dashed as fast as Deshaun Watson led the Tigers to four touchdown drives on their first four possesssions of the game, kick-starting what ended up as a 58-0 Clemson win. \nThe 58-point margin of defeat for Miami makes it the worst loss in program history. It was a complete unraveling on national television that turns the spotlight right back on Al Golden and his future with the Canes. \n\"We had a good week. I thought we were locked in,\" Golden told WQAM after the game, via the Palm Beach Post . \"We practiced really hard. We got beat in every phase you can get beat, including penalties. That's my responsibility, period. \n\"We didn't do a good enough job [against the run game]. They played with a lead, we couldn't bring any pressure to them and it got lopsided. Physical group up front [for Clemson]; we didn't block them well enough. We've got to do a better job protecting. We got beat up front. We've got to get it corrected quickly.\" \nClemson recorded 63 rushing attempts and totaled 416 yards on the ground (6.6 yards per attempt). The Tigers went deep into the depth chart after getting an early lead but it not change the results. While Miami was standing-to-toe with Florida State in Tallahassee just a few short weeks ago, this is the kind of loss that will be interpreted as an indication of where Miami stands in comparison to the ACC's best. \nAfter the game, Al Golden looked distraught. While the band played the alma mater, Golden's focus was turned down, away from the home fans that were left in Sun Life Stadium. \nAl Golden with players postgame during playing of alma mater.

It is James, who got his athletic career started in ticket sales for Miami football in the mid-1990s, who will have the final say on whether Golden remains in place as Miami's coach. \nMiami AD Blake James tells me no coaching change coming after game. Called it , \"disappointing,\" but, \"We'll go and get ready to play Duke.\" — Dave Hyde (@davehydesports) October 24, 2015 \nMiami plays at Duke next week in the first of five ACC Costal Division games to close the season. The Hurricanes aren't totally out of the division race yet -- division leaders Pitt, UNC and Duke are all on the slate -- but it will take five straight wins and a little help to get a result that might erase the taste of this awful loss. \nFormer Miami great Leon Searcy offered his opinion on the issue. \n58-0 worst loss in school history. I played in 60 college games and over 160 NFL games and never loss like that. — Leon Searcy (@leonsearcy72) October 24, 2015 \nAl Golden can't get on the bus tell that MF to get a Uber — Leon Searcy (@leonsearcy72) October 24, 2015 \nMiami fans have seen enough... pic.twitter.com/XADn9SHetH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:00:10.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
