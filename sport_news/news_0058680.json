A win would put Texas in a better position make a bowl game. The Longhorns will have to prove that Kansas State doesn't have their number as the Wildcats have won six of the last seven games in the series.\nKansas State is looking for its first win in Big 12 play. The Wildcats have lost two closes games in conference play against Oklahoma State and TCU. But Kansas State suffered its worst loss Saturday against the Sooners, 55-0. Saturday's game against Texas will be a chance for the Wildcats to bounce back from their blowout loss.\nWhen Kansas State has the ball\nWhen the Wildcats have the ball they'll look to maintain possession. Kansas State has averaged 32 minutes of possession this season.\nThe Wildcats will try to run the ball with freshman running back Justin Silmon and junior quarterback Joe Huebner. Silmon has rushed for 285 yards and two touchdowns, and Huebner has run for 321 yards and six touchdowns.\nThe Longhorns will have to guard Kansas State's run-pass option which the Wildcats have found success running.\nKansas State is also an efficient redzone offense. The Wildcats have been able to score points when they get into the redzone 90 percent of the time. Texas will have to prevent Kansas State from finding its way into the redzone.\nWhen Texas has the ball\nWhen the Longhorns get the ball, they'll look to run the ball.\nTexas has had some success on the ground this season and will look to continue to build off the 313 yard rushing performance it had against Oklahoma.\nThe Longhorns will utilize redshirt freshman Jerrod Heard's athleticism. They use him multiple ways to get him in the open field from quarterback draws to zone-read plays. Texas will also try to get the ball into the hands of its running backs - sophomore D'Onta Foreman and senior Johnathan Gray.\nTexas has struggled to get its passing game going but will try to get Heard going against Kansas State.\nThe Longhorns will also look to use junior quarterback Tyrone Swoopes in a short-yardage run package.\nPrediction\nThe weather forecast for Saturday's game shows a high percentage of rain which means whichever team is able to establish its running game will likely be the winner.\nTexas has shown its capable being a run-heavy team but the Wildcats have a tenacious rushing defense which could stymie the Longhorns' run game. While Kansas State has been able to run the ball, it isn't a top rushing offense. At times Texas has given up big yards to opponents' ground games. The Longhorn defense will need to a performance much like its game against Oklahoma.\nAlthough the Wildcats have beaten Texas six of the last seven times, the Longhorns find a way to pull out a win Saturday.\nScore: Texas 24, Kansas State 14\nFull coverage: Predictions, analysis, more\nCLICK HERE TO VISIT THE TEXAS LONGHORNS PAGE\nTexas prediction: What it will take for Longhorns to power past Kansas State\nTexas midseason position grades: Longhorns show they're an average team at halfway mark\nFive things Texas fans should know about Kansas State, including Wildcats' winning record over Longhorns\nTexas midseason report: Postseason hopes look grim\nLook: Apple includes Hook 'Em emoji\nTexas extends ties with Nike apparel; 15-year, $200 million deal will be richest in college sports\nBig 12 power rankings (10/21): Top spots remain intact, Kansas State drops after home blowout\nTexas quotable: Longhorns looking to move on from win over Oklahoma\nBest in Texas (10/19): Baylor becomes first unanimous No. 1 team; Houston inches closer to Texas Tech\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/21/texas-midseason-position-grades-longhorns-show-average-team-halfway-mark", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/20/texas-midseason-report-heard-jefferson-headline-mvp-honors", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/21/source-texas-nike-break-new-financial-ground-15-year-deal", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/20/five-things-texas-fans-know-kansas-state-including-wildcats-winning-record-longhorns", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/22/texas-prediction-will-take-longhorns-power-past-kansas-state", "https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/18/best-texas-1019-baylor-becomes-first-unanimous-1-team-houston-inches-closer-texas-tech", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/21/look-apple-includes-hook-em-emoji", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/20/big-12-power-rankings-1021-top-spots-remain-intact-kansas-state-drops-home-blowout", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/19/texas-quotable-longhorns-looking-move-win-oklahoma", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-longhorns"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:17:54.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
