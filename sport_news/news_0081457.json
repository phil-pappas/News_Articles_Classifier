Watch Elmo for 20 minutes.'\" \nIn the past, the American Academy of Pediatrics said children under the age of two should not have any screen time at all. This month it's changed that recommendation. \n\"I think it's an approach to realistic parenting,\" Sanford Pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Haggar said. \nNow there's no time limit on the amount of screen time for your toddler. Instead it's trying to educate parents on how they can help their children get the most out of media use. \n\"Really what the guideline did that I liked is it talked about how important it is for parents to interact, especially with younger children, in those environments,\" Haggar said. \nHaggar says you should narrate apps and educational shows to your children, just like you do a book. Also, make sure you're choosing quality programs. \n\"I often recommend that parents create a special folder that the child uses, and they just go into that folder. Then young children are not going into wide things, like YouTube, where they can really get into all sorts of the Internet without a lot of supervision,\" Haggar said. \nWhile you can find ways to make screens more interactive with your children, it still doesn't replace books and other forms of learning. \n\"We still know kids don't learn as well from that,\" Haggar said. \nThat's why Perkins is still limiting screen time with her 15 month old. She's also trying to lead by example, which isn't necessarily easy in this tech-savvy world. \n\"My husband and I try to put our phones away until he goes to bed,\" Perkins said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:03:37.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
