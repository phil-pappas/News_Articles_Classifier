(Photo: Marc Lebryk-USA TODAY Sports)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The American men’s chances of returning to the podium at the world gymnastics championships, let alone qualifying for the Rio Olympics on the first go-around, just got a lot tougher.\nThree-time U.S. champion Sam Mikulak withdrew from this month’s world championships Saturday with an injured left ankle. Alternates Chris Brooks and Marvin Kimble will both travel to worlds in Glasgow, Scotland, and a decision on who competes will be made there.\nBrooks hasn’t competed at a major international meet since 2010. This would be Kimble’s first world championships.\nUSA TODAY\nGabby Douglas, Aly Raisman on U.S. gymnastics team for World Championships\nThe Americans must finish in the top eight at the world championships to book a spot in next summer’s Rio Olympics. While that would seem like a given – the U.S. won the bronze medal last year and hasn’t finished lower than fifth at worlds or the Olympics since 2006 – not having Mikulak leaves the U.S. with a huge hole.\nMikulak posted the highest scores on vault and parallel bars at the U.S. championships in August, and was in the top seven on the remaining four events. No other U.S. man managed to crack the top 10 on all six events.\nPlus, Mikulak is one of the few U.S. men who can consistently put up world-class scores on pommel horse, by far the Americans’ weakest event.\nUSA TODAY\nSam Mikulak takes early lead at U.S. gymnastics championships\nLondon all-around bronze medalist Danell Leyva; Alex Naddour; Paul Ruggeri; Donnell Whittenburg; and Brandon Wynn make up the rest of the team.\nShould the Americans not make the top eight at worlds, they will have one more chance at qualifying. Teams that finish ninth-16th go to a test event in April in Rio, where the remaining four Olympic spots will be decided.\nBut the Americans would prefer to avoid the test event because it will force them to revamp their training schedule, which is geared toward peaking for nationals and the Olympic trials in June, and then again for Rio in August.\nLosing Mikulak is sure to renew criticism of the decision to leave three-time world medalist Jake Dalton off the worlds team.\nA nerve injury in his shoulder prevented Dalton from competing at nationals, where the world team was chosen. Confident he’d be healthy in time for worlds, the 2012 Olympian petitioned for a spot on the team.\nUSA TODAY\nU.S. junior champ Laurie Hernandez too young for world gymnastics championships\nBut the selection committee bypassed him. Even considering Dalton as if he were “completely healthy,” national team coordinator Kevin Mazeika said then that the selection committee felt the team was stronger without him.\nWhen he wasn’t even selected as an alternate, Dalton decided to have surgery to alleviate the problem that caused the nerve injury so he’d be ready for Rio. He is still a few weeks from being able to resume full training.\nMikulak’s injury also will raise questions about the wisdom of picking a team in mid-August when worlds don’t begin until Oct. 23. The U.S. women didn’t name their team until Thursday night, ensuring Martha Karolyi is taking the best squad available to the world championships.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e1b45c6f012d9acbbe3444c502d9583e949b1216/r=500x386/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800977850447960-USATSI-8752538.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lon983&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d35a70ff2b6b91c7c04577e51917a29a880c1af1/c=139-354-2440-2655/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798381852160957-XXX-Karolyi-7356.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lon983&text=U.S.%20gymnastics%20champ%20Sam%20Mikulak%20to%20miss%20world%20championships%20with%20ankle%20injury&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f68d466d42009df2ad23c7b4709c2247a6349e0/c=0-19-1826-1392&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800977850447960-USATSI-8752538.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/742ddbf58a2c5264f00931dfb54d52629815da8f/c=664-243-2391-1970/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799365753078411-XXX-KAROLYI-7350-76337280-1-.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800977850447960-USATSI-8752538.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6e50c2a8bc244595885a31c5fd6e897ad83aa54/c=126-0-3582-3456/local/-/media/2015/08/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635751886742722709-AP-US-CHAMPIONSHIPS-GYMNASTICS-75140914.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-11T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:43:04.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
