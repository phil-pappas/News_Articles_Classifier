What happened tonight shows that when you play against a team whose players have played 20 games in the year you can't compete. \n\"The national team comes last. It is time that everyone in French rugby sit around a table and make the France team a priority. \n\"If this does not happen the next coach will face the same problems.\" \nLONG TRIPS \nNew Zealand's five Super Rugby teams play between 16 and 19 matches a season, some involving long trips to South Africa and back, but senior All Blacks were all spared two of those matches this year at the insistence of the New Zealand Rugby Union. \nSeveral key players such as flyhalf Dan Carter and flanker Richie McCaw, both in their thirties, have also been granted six month sabbaticals from rugby over the last couple of years in an attempt to extend their careers at the top of the game. \nFrance technical director Didier Retiere had warned that even if they have a World Cup culture, Les Bleus were on a slippery slope. \n\"What is striking is that we've had the same problems with (coaches) Jean-Claude Skrela, Bernard Laporte, Marc Lievremont and now Philippe Saint-Andre,\" he told Reuters last March. \n\"We've been struggling to have a team able to perform at the international level on a regular basis. The environment does not help. The players are not prepared as they should be.\" \nThe Top 14 being the most competitive league in the northern hemisphere, other nations are sending top players to develop there, meaning French young talents find it harder to emerge. \n\"Our youngsters have to fight for their place against them -- so they don't play much. We're the only country in this situation,\" said Retiere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:59:16.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
