He got to know the owner and employees, who took him under their wings to teach him about the fine points of growing and harvesting marijuana.\nEventually he was hired to make medical sales, and when the doors opened Thursday, he was ready to help recreational users decide between marijuana strains with evocative names: Ace of Spaces, Mad Scientist and Super Silver Haze.\nHe said Sativa, a specific type of marijuana, produces a \"high in the head, behind the eyes and gets you going.\"\nIndica, another variety, gives the kind of high \"where you sit on the couch and want to eat a lot of food.\"\nRamirez said his mother was \"furious\" when he told her he was smoking marijuana. But she's \"very supportive\" now that recreational use is legal.\nOn Thursday, Ramirez opened small glass jars on a countertop, inviting customers to smell the buds. He talked about soil, pointing out differences between the varieties. In another setting, he could have been talking about wine and debating the full body merits of a 1998 or 2011 cabernet.\n\"We get the product from the best growers around,\" he said. \"Growers in Sandy, Estacada and Welches. One man has been growing for 15 years. Now he can do it legally.\"\nThe doors opened at 7 a.m., and within an hour more than 60 people had bought marijuana.\n\"I never thought I'd say this,\" Ramirez said. \"I'm selling marijuana.\"\nOne customer walked into the shop and began crying when Ramirez asked if he could help her.\n\"I'm 60,\" said Suzann, who did not want to provide her last name. \"I never thought I'd see the day.\"\nShe said she's been smoking marijuana for years, going to the bathroom so her daughter, Rebecca, wouldn't discover what she was doing. She finally told her daughter.\n\"Her mouth dropped open,\" Suzann recalled. \"She couldn't believe it.\"\nShock turned to interest, and they both began smoking, buying product on the street, never sure what was in the marijuana.\nOn Thursday, she brought her daughter, now 24, with her to the dispensary.\n\"This is like being in a candy store,\" Suzann told Ramirez. \"I'm so confused.\"\n\"What are you looking for?\" Ramirez asked. \"What kind of high.\"\n\"I'm not sure,\" Suzann said. \"Something laid back.\"\nRamirez suggested a hybrid called Miss Universe.\nHer daughter, Rebecca stepped forward.\n\"And you?\" Ramirez asked her.\n\"I want to be stoned out of my head.\"\nHe suggested Night Terror.\nPackages in hand, they headed for home.\n--Tom Hallman Jr.\n503 221-8224; thallman@oregonian.com\n@thalljr", "external_links": ["http://www.canna-daddys.com/"], "published": "2015-10-01T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:06:47.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
