(AP Photo/Patric Schneider) AJ Mast Andrew out of excuses, Colts out of Luck \nAssociated PressIndianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck (12) reacts to fumbling the ball against the New York Jets in Indianapolis Monday. Posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 12:00 am Andrew out of excuses, Colts out of Luck On Pro Football Hector Longo Eagle-Tribune \nAndrew Luck has exhausted his excuses. The kid, no longer a kid at 26 with three full seasons under his belt, has been unmasked. \nDo you realize that in his last 10 games, Luck has thrown 16 interceptions? Think about that. And then understand that Tom Brady has never thrown 16 picks in any of his 14 seasons as a starter. \nThe interceptions tell the Andrew Luck story. They proclaim it to the heavens. \nLuck is good with an upside of very good. \nHe's no threat to the legend of Peyton Manning in Indy, let alone to ascend into the Brady/Montana atmosphere. \nSo far, the former No. 1 pick's career could be summed up simply by a 17-2 career mark against South Division pin cushions Houston, Tennessee and Jacksonville with a whole lot of empty promises and a 20-18 record against everyone else. \nLuck is losing fans fast nationally. Folks are tired of this growing myth. \nThe good news for him. He's still got opportunities for the signature win. \nTonight on his home fake turf against the Patriots is the next shot. Las Vegas says “No Chance,” with a 9-point spread. Another humbling defeat could do Luck severe damage. \nRemember, his football team went on national TV last week and won without him. \nHis excuses are starting to tatter. \nLuck's pathetic start to the year – 7 INTs and 5 TD passes – immediately got tossed on the offensive line in front of him. \nDon't believe that. \n“They're top in the league in big-play runs. They're top in the league in big-play passes,” cracked New England defensive coordinator Matt Patricia. \nA week ago, the Colts offensive line stared at one of the menacing fronts in the game with JJ Watt, Brian Cushing, Vince Wilfork and Jadeveon Clowney out for bear. \nMatt Hasselbeck, the journeyman in their to replace an injured Luck, was not touched the entire game. \nIn fact, in both of Hasselbeck's starts, the Colts did not yield a sack. \nIs it the offensive line or has Luck been holding the football too long waiting for a receiver to come free? \nAnd that brings us to another lament from Luck's supporters. He's never had good receivers. \nCurrently, the Colts feature Andre Johnson, a veteran headed to the Hall of Fame; T.Y. Hilton, a 25-year-old burner in his prime who already has been to the Pro Bowl; and 22-year-old Donte Moncrief, a 221-pound physical specimen who oozes future star. \nTo make this team on the ground, the Colts brought in Frank Gore, a veteran with Super Bowl experience and eight 1,000-yard seasons. \n“Obviously just tremendous speed at the wide receiver position, guys who can just flat out fly and push vertical downfield for the deep-ball throws, but also guys who have great catch-and-run ability,” said Patricia. “I think they're complemented with Andre Johnson, his ability now as just a big wide receiver who does a great job of separating at the top of routes, finding open spaces in the zones, really has a deep-threat ability and a possession-type of ability. So, they certainly have a complement of weapons on offense.” \nLuck is simply running out of excuses, the latest being this crutch of a shoulder injury that has kept him out of the last two games. \nHe is currently probable to make his return against the Patriots, a team that has befuddled and humiliated him. Luck is 0-4 against the Pats with four TD passes and 10 interceptions. \nHis teams have scored 18.3 points a game and have been outscored by 29.5 points a game in the losses. \nLuck has been conspicuous by his absence. That tells me he's feeling the pressure. And he doesn't like the heat. \nThe best the Colts could come up with this week to explain his inability to reach his lofty potential? \nCoach Chuck Pagano: “We're a team, we're a family. We win as a team and we lose as a team. I have to coach better. We have to execute better. We have to play better. A lot of things have to happen, it just doesn't fall on one guy.\" \nSorry, Chuck. But it does fall on one guy. Andrew Luck. \nHe's out of excuses. And because of it the Colts could be out of Luck. \nLONGO ON THE MYTH OF ANDREW LUCK \nEagle-Tribune NFL columnist Hector Longo has never felt that Andrew Luck belonged among the potential elite quarterbacks in the game. \nHere's a history of Longo's feelings that have gone on the record in The Eagle-Tribune. \n“He is not the next Brady or Peyton Manning. He is the next Matt Ryan, good but not great. “ \nJan. 19, 2015 \n“As for Luck, maybe next year. Then again after watching him repeatedly collapse against any decent competition, maybe not.” \nNov. 17, 2014 \n“I do not believe in 'the next Manning,' either. Andrew Luck (8 INTs and 70.0 passer rating in three playoff games) is not a threat.” \nApril 28, 2014 \n“All those NFL types who have this guy on a Hall of Fame track, please be ready to be humbled. Luck is limited. He makes too many bad decisions and throws balls up for grabs. \nJan. 7, 2014", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:38:37.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
