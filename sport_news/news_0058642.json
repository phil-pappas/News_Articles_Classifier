On Wednesday, the man confirmed it was his dog that was killed.\nThe OPP said Wednesday they have contacted the dog’s owner and are continuing to investigate what happened.\n\"I think running her over was maybe a little inhumane,\" the dog's owner, identified only as Scott, told CTV News on Tuesday.\nResidents on the street are now demanding answers saying they are outraged with what they perceive to be animal cruelty.\nVideo ‘disturbing,’ former OPP commissioner says\nThe former head of the province’s police force described video capturing the incident as ‘disturbing’ late Wednesday afternoon.\n“I can see why the general public is concerned when they see that,” Chris Lewis, former OPP commissioner, said in an interview with CP24.\n“I certainly am not aware of any time we have had to use a vehicle to kill an animal – justified of course. It was kind of a bizarre way to deal with (the dog).”\nLewis added that he did not know all the circumstances that led police to make the decision to kill the animal – including how the dog was behaving and what, if any, threat the animal posed to people in the area at the time.\n“There are a lot of unknowns there,\" he said.\n“But certainly at face value it appears shocking and concerning.”\nPhotos An image from a video shows a police cruiser about to ram a dog in Collingwood on Oct. 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:04:17.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
