(AP) Cody Clements passed for 205 yards and two touchdowns, and South Alabama's defense came away with a needed stop in its 24-18 win over Troy in the Sun Belt Conference opener for each team Saturday night. \nTroy (1-3) started its final drive at its own 17, trailing 24-18 with 3:29 remaining. South Alabama's Akeem Lewis stopped Brandon Burks for no gain on fourth-and-1 from Troy's 43, and the Jaguars were able to run out the clock on the ensuing possession. Burks finished with 83 yards on 26 carries and caught four passes for 20 yards. \nKalen Jackson - six tackles, two tackles for loss and two interceptions - led the defensive effort for South Alabama (3-2). \nXavier Johnson scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter and ended with 94 yards. Josh Magee had 118 yards receiving and Gerald Everett caught Clements' two touchdown passes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:53:14.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
