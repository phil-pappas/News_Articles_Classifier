(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner) By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The first time Yordano Ventura touched the baseball in a postseason game, he was in a pretty awkward spot. \nDefinitely not known for his relieving prowess, Royals manager Ned Yost inserted Ventura in the sixth inning of last year’s wild-card game against the Oakland A’s with two on and nobody out. What transpired — a three-run home run by Brandon Moss — took the life out of an electric stadium, and two batters later, Ventura was removed from the game. \nVentura, though, bounced back from that adversity by dominating at times during last year’s run to the World Series. And the Royals are banking that he can do the same this October. \nVentura will get that chance as the staff ace when he starts Game 1 of the American League Division Series against the Houston Astros at 6:37 p.m. Thursday at Kauffman Stadium. \nThat label was once a detriment to Ventura early in the season, but now it is a role he says he is ready to embrace. \n“I have a responsibility as the No. 1 starter,” Ventura said through interpreter Pedro Grifol. “I feel like I have a responsibility to the club, and especially the staff that gave the opportunity to be the Game 1 starter. But nothing will change as far as my preparation physically and mentally. I just have to go out there and execute.” \nVentura, who went 13-8 with a 4.08 ERA this season, will face Houston right-hander Collin McHugh (19-7, 3.89 ERA). Ventura enters the game riding a wave of success, going 4-1 in September and 9-2 with a 3.56 ERA since the All-Star break. \nVentura began the year as the team’s opening day starter, but he let his emotions get the best of him, especially early. He endured a suspension, a trip to the disabled list and hit rock bottom with a quick demotion to Triple-A Omaha. \n“I’m not an exception to adversity,” Ventura said. “I’m human. I’m a baseball player. I went through a difficult time, and at times I wasn’t able to handle it the way I wanted. But I kept confident in my ability and kept working a lot. I stayed in my routine and that’s what got me here today.” \nStatistically speaking, Ventura’s uptick began when Johnny Cueto arrived, but Ventura said there were many nights where he was awake wondering why he had lost his confidence. He eventually realized it was up to him and him alone. \n“I realized that I’m the only person that can help myself with confidence,” Ventura said. “Nobody can create confidence for me.” \nVentura regained that confidence in part by using his secondary pitches more. Royals catcher Salvador Perez also said he saw a more focused pitcher on the mound. \n“Yordano has grown pretty good,” Perez said. “At the start of the season, he had some problems and lost concentration. But the last six or seven starts, he’s been pitching really good. He’s using his secondary pitches a lot and I think he’s going to come out tomorrow and be aggressive and use his secondary pitches as well.” \nVentura has been piling up the strikeouts lately, and that bodes well for the Royals, considering the Astros led the AL in strikeouts during the regular season. \n“He’s a tough pitcher,” Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. “We faced him once here in Kansas City during the summer. It’s a tough call whether to be aggressive versus him, versus be very selective. If you fall behind him, it’s a bigger challenge to hit him. So you’ve got to be ready to hit. He does spray the ball from time to time, but he has electrifying stuff when he's on. Velocity, top notch. Good breaking ball. Understands the moment. He pitches with a lot of emotion. There’s probably going to be a few people in the stands that are elevating that intensity tomorrow night.” \nYost experienced that very same intensity during last year’s wild-card game, though it was in furor from the home crowd as he walked to the mound to get Ventura. When Yost walked back to the dugout, a chorus of boos followed him with every step. \nBut Yost likely won’t put himself in that same position Thursday. And after guiding the team to an AL pennant last year and the best record in the AL this year, Yost is in pretty good graces with the fans. And now he hopes they can enjoy the ride together with his team all the way to the World Series. \n“This is a fun time of year,” Yost said. “We’ve been looking forward to this since the day spring training started. And that’s the major difference between this year and last year. Last year, we weren’t sure what we could accomplish. We thought we were a good team, but we weren’t sure if we could get into the playoffs. This year from Day 1 of spring training, we knew we were going to be back in this position.” \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:35:04.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
