Morehead. ''We are grateful for Russ’s dedicated service, and we look forward to welcoming Que as our new mascot.'' \nThe half-brother of Uga VII, Russ compiled an overall record of 44-19. He served as an interim Bulldog mascot for a total of 25 games, working nine games during the 2009 and 2010 seasons after Uga VII and VIII passed away. Russ roamed the sidelines at all 14 games during the 2011 season. He then served for two wins at the beginning of the 2012 season before being promoted as Uga IX prior to the Florida Atlantic game on Sept. 15, 2012. \nQue will assume his new title after a successful three-month audition in the role as UGA’s mascot. He made appearances at the Countdown to Kickoff event in July, as well as Picture Day in August, before presiding over all seven of Georgia’s 2015 football games thus far. \n\"We are thrilled to have Que join our long line of mascots and he has already proven to be up to the task of serving as our official mascot,'' said J. Reid Parker Director of Athletics Greg McGarity. ''We tip our cap to Russ, who served admirably as UGA IX and has been a great mentor to Que, UGA X. \n''We also thank the remarkable Seiler family for their continued support of our program in such a special way.'' \nThe continuous line of Georgia Bulldog mascots has been owned by the Frank W. “Sonny” Seiler family of Savannah, Ga., since 1956.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:27:50.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
