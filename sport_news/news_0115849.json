Which team will beat its over/under line by the most wins?\nSacramento Kings over 30.5. Last year, only five teams beat their lines by at least seven wins and, remarkably, all five did so by at least 13. Those five teams fell into two groups: 1) the Warriors and Hawks, who captured perfect regular-season chemistry and ran away from the field to win their respective conferences, and 2) the Bucks, Jazz and Celtics, three teams who were expected to win 27 or fewer games and wound up in the vicinity of .500.\nAre there any teams capable of making the “good to amazing” leap like the Warriors and Hawks this year? That’s not an easy question to answer. The above-average teams with the biggest upside compared to last year—based on their offseason additions, projected health and coaching changes—include the Thunder, Spurs, Rockets and Clippers. While all four of those teams have the potential to win 60+ games if things break right, Las Vegas set all of their lines well above the Warriors’ 50.5 last year. Houston is the most enticing of that bunch, at 54.5, given the general stability of its roster, James Harden ’s ascendance as an MVP candidate, the something-for-not-much addition of Ty Lawson , and the reasonable assumption that Dwight Howard won’t miss half the season again due to injury. But, all things considered, 54.5 is still a high enough bar to inspire a little second-guessing.\nNBA Video Roundtable: Which NBA star is under the most pressure this season? by SI.com Staff", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/chalk/story/_/id/13772067/nba-westgate-las-vegas-superbook-releases-2015-16-season-win-totals", "http://twitter.com/bengolliver"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:38:13.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
