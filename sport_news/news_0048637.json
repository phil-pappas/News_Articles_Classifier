We have to keep it up.\"\nThe Cardinals, who are ranked No. 5 in Southeastern Pennsylvania by The Inquirer, have outscored foes by 236-34. They are a win away from equaling last season's 8-0 start. \nWinebrake and company kept the Colonials' run-heavy offense, which features swift backs Nafeese Nasir and Blaise Gravinese, from making an impact. \n\"We were trying to clog up the middle against them,\" Winebrake said. \"We wanted to force them to try to bounce outside for yardage.\" \nRyan Stover, the coach's son, connected on 17 of 24 passes for 214 yards and a career-best five touchdowns. He also reached pay dirt on a 4-yard, second-quarter run. \nStover fired scoring passes to Mike Sowers, Kaleif Lee, Danny Boggs, Cole Swiger, and Rockwell Wright. His three third-quarter touchdown passes put PW (5-2, 2-2) into a 35-0 hole. \nUpper Dublin lost Stacey Gardner, a fullback and linebacker, to an ankle injury in the first quarter. \"It didn't look too bad, so hopefully he'll be back soon,\" Winebrake said. After Gardner went down, Winebrake's sophomore bother, Max, filled in at linebacker. \nHenry Winebrake, who has a 4.25 grade-point average, is a stalwart defender in lacrosse and also wrestles. The 18-year-old from Oreland plans to major in engineering or business in college. \nUpper Dublin 7 7 21 7 - 42 \nPlymouth Whitemarsh 0 0 0 0 - 0 \nUD: Mike Sowers 14 pass from Ryan Stover (Todd Spirt kick) \nUD: Stover 4 run (Spirt kick) \nUD: Kaleif Lee 9 pass from Stover (Spirt kick) \nUD: Danny Boggs 9 pass from Stover (Spirt kick) \nUD: Cole Swiger 11 pass from Stover (Spirt kick) \nUD: Rockwell Wright 19 pass from Stover (Spirt kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:30:54.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
