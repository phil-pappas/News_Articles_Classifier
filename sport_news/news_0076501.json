The Rebels remain alive in the SEC West, but their hopes of a storybook season and a berth in the College Football Playoff — all very real after an upset of Alabama in Tuscaloosa on Sept. 19 — are dashed. \nMemphis quarterback Paxton Lynch, on the other hand, might have made himself some money Saturday. Lynch completed 39 of 53 passes for 384 yards and three touchdowns. It marked the fifth consecutive game in which the 6-7, 245-pound redshirt junior has thrown for more than 300 yards. Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. \nWhat’s more, Lynch displayed all the throws NFL scouts love. He threw rockets and touch passes, threw across his body safely and launched the deep ball. On a day when Memphis showed no ability to run consistently until late in the fourth quarter, Lynch kept the chains moving. \nHe was particularly sharp on third down, finding wide receiver Anthony Miller again and again for first downs. Memphis has won 13 in a row and looks like the best non-Power Five team in the nation. \n“Lynch is one of the best-kept secrets in college football,” Ole Miss linebacker Mike Hilton said before the game. \nNot anymore. \nThis week's other winners and losers in college football: Winners \nOklahoma: After a shocking loss to a Texas team that appeared in danger of disintegrating, Oklahoma traveled to face a generally tough Kansas State team. Not since 1999, in coach Bob Stoops’ first year in Norman, had the Sooners lost back-to-back games. They still haven’t. Oklahoma put on a road clinic as quarterback Baker Mayfield threw five touchdown passes. The 55-0 final score sounded like an old-fashioned Oklahoma win from its wishbone days, which suits Sooner Nation just fine. \nFlorida State: The Seminoles have lost one game in the past three years and still don’t seem to get much respect. They certainly didn’t earn any in the first half against Louisville when they trailed 7-6 at home. But in the second half the Seminoles showed the kind of explosive offense they had in 2013, when quarterback Jameis Winston won the Heisman Trophy and led them to the national championship. \nEverett Golson threw for for three touchdowns while Florida State running back Dalvin Cook had another 100-yard game (his fourth this season) and the Seminoles romped 41-21. Losers \nNorthwestern: How quickly fortunes can change in college football. Northwestern was one of the toasts of September. A 16-6 victory in the opener against Stanford was looking better and better as the Cardinal began beating teams handily. Then the Wildcats went to Michigan. They limped out last week after a 38-0 licking and returned home seeking to recharge and keep alive their hopes of winning the Big Ten West. Instead, Iowa came in and whipped Northwestern 40-10 . The win means Iowa (7-0) should rise in the rankings as Northwestern vanishes, and the Hawkeyes control their destiny in terms of getting to Indianapolis for the Big Ten championship game. \nTexas A&M: Texas A&M expanded Kyle Field, turning it into a spectacular venue and the biggest in the SEC. But under coach Kevin Sumlin the Aggies have never beaten a top 20 team at home. That ugly streak remains alive after No. 9 Alabama (6-1) came to town and beat previously undefeated No. 10 A&M 41-23 . \nThe Aggies boast one of the best groups of skill-position players in the SEC, and quarterback Kyle Allen has seemed to improve week after week. In the first half Saturday, however, Allen threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns, and Alabama rolled to a 28-6 lead. \nIt was reminiscent of last year when Alabama waxed A&M in Tuscaloosa 59-0. To its credit, A&M battled back, but the Aggies could never make up the lost ground. \nMichigan: Once, people would have said everything was coming up roses for Michigan in 2015. The Rose Bowl isn’t the same holy destination it used to be for Big Ten teams, but there wasn’t any question Michigan, back in the rankings and 5-1, was one of the best stories in college football. New coach Jim Harbaugh, a Michigan man, had instilled the team with a ferocity it had lacked for some time. Michigan wasn’t beating people, it was shutting them out week after week. \nIn a nasty miracle for Wolverines fans that won’t soon be forgotten, however, rival Michigan State beat Michigan 27-23 on the last play of the game . \nIt had been a gem between two good teams, but it turned crazy on the final play: Michigan punter Blake O’Neill fumbled the snap and then tried to kick the ball while getting spun sideways, and Michigan State’s Jalen Watts-Jackson caught the ball and ran it 38 yards into the end zone as time expired. \nHOW THE TOP 25 FARED IN WEEK 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:23:18.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
