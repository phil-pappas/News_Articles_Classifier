He said it has been his decision not to have any specific discussions with Rogers or Shapiro because of the club being in the playoffs. \n“It will be addressed at the appropriate time but that time is not today and I can’t stress enough that that was my desire,” Anthopoulos said. “We continue to do the job the way we always have, continue to plan the way we always have. I’ve had meetings, started to go through free agency (who they’d like to talk to), trades, that continues at all times.” \nSo, he’s not just sitting on his ass waiting to hear from Shapiro. \nOne major part of the press conference was his ‘eureka’ moment last year when he evolved as a GM and decided that what was missing from the Jays was more than talent, it was having the right kind of players with an abundance of character who are team oriented first. It’s what led him to go out and trade for Josh Donaldson and sign Russell Martin as a free agent. \n“I think we’ve got a lot more clarity on the type of players we want,” he said. “As an organization you want talent and great players and we’ve talked about it to death, the type of values, makeup, character that we’re going to bring in we’re going to stay consistent on. \n“I looked across the field at the Royals and I think they’ve done the same thing.” \nLater on Anthopoulos would describe it as having an identity for the team, being a “Blue Jays type of player.” \nWhich is what? \n“Team-oriented, selfless, hard-nosed, smart, talented, very good athletes, good defensively,” Anthopoulos replied. \nHe went on to say he believes he’s “starting to hit my stride, starting to understand things a little bit more.” \nHe was asked to clarify. \n“We definitely made some conscious changes,” he said. “We haven’t had problems bringing in great, talented players here but maybe not the right fit for this organization or what we were trying to do or trying to be about. By design last off-season we really targeted a certain type of player. We walked away from a lot of players that were talented and productive that didn’t fit what we were trying to do. I don’t know that as a GM I would have done that a few years earlier. You learn from your mistakes.” \nThe GM also made a point of heaping praise on his manager, John Gibbons especially for his ability to keep an even keel when injuries struck. \n“I thought John did a tremendous job bringing this team together,” Anthopoulos said. “He did not have the easiest time early in the year with the bullpen unsettled. He didn’t complain, he continued to find solutions. John’s the one who got Chris Colabello up (from Buffalo). That was a great move. He didn’t complain when he had two infielders playing the corner outfield (Jose Bautista with his sore shoulder and Michael Saunders with his knee injury). I can’t give him enough credit for the way he kept it together.” \nPoints of interest regarding the status of certain players is as follows: \n-- R.A. Dickey, who the Jays can bring back if they pick up his $12 million option. It looks like it’s going to happen. “I think R.A.’s put himself in a very good position,” Anthopoulos said. “The way he pitched in the second half of the year, we don’t win the East or get to the playoffs without what he did for us. He’s in a very good position.” \n-- David Price is a free agent that will command something in the neighborhood of seven years and $30 million a season. Are the Jays a player? \n“He was great for us,” Anthopoulos said. “He was a huge part of us getting to the post-season and winning the division and also was a big part of making the culture of the clubhouse even stronger than it had been. We have strong interest in David being back and I know he’s very open to being back here. Where that leads, where that goes I have no idea at this time, it’s too early. I think we’ll certainly be in the game but with free agency you just don’t know.” \n-- Will Aaron Sanchez and Roberto Osuna be competing for spots in the rotation? \n“We’ve started to talk about it but we’re not sure yet,” he said. “We have the ability to do that and there’s scenarios where that could happen. Long-term we view both of them as starters.” In other words, it depends on what they do in the off-season regrading trades and signing free agents. \n-- Marco Estrada had a tremendous season in the rotation and was their best starter in the playoffs. He’s also a free agent. What’s the Jays interest? \n“I was in Sunday, saw him (cleaning out his locker), talked to him and reiterated to him we’d like to have him back and he’d like to be back,” Anthopoulos said. “It’s a great starting point and we’ll see where that goes but I’m optimistic and hopeful that he’ll be here going forward.” \nSame goes regarding Anthopoulos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:56:30.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
