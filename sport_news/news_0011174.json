The Tigers get to host their archrival, the Camdenton Lakers (3-6), for the opening round of playoffs next week. Waynesville finished as the five seed, and Camdenton four, but the Missouri State High School Activities Association rulebook states that if two teams have matching records and are seeded within one slot of each other, the team with the head-to-head victory receives the higher seed and gets to host. Two weeks ago the Tigers smashed the Lakers 42-21, so they're eager to take another swipe at them, especially now that the stakes are higher. \"We told the kids there's 48 minutes left in the season and every game from here on forward will be that way,\" Drehle said. \"We control our destiny. Camdenton happens to be who it is and that adds a little extra fuel to the fire and hopefully that'll help us to prepare.\" That would certainly be helpful, because one thing was evident Friday -- the Tigers were not ready for the seventh-ranked team in Missouri's Class 6. In the opening seven minutes of the game, the Chiefs scored three touchdowns. The first came on a Malachi Stout 14-yard touchdown run, the second, following an interception, was on a Maverick McGee 57-yard cutback run. On the ensuing kickoff, the Tigers fumbled the ball and Kickapoo capitalized on a 21-yard strike from Chris Lawson to Mason Pack. Stout had a seven-yard touchdown run with 23.7 seconds left in the first quarter to give the Chiefs a 28-0 advantage. Drehle couldn't pinpoint exactly what caused the game to be so lopsided early. \"I'm not sure what it was,\" he said. \"As coaches, we'll go back and look at everything, and we'll blame ourselves for not having our kids prepared. They're a good football team and I think we were a little bit shell shocked from the speed and physical play they had.\" Pack made it a 35-0 game with 2:56 left in the second quarter on a 65-yard catch-and-run. Waynesville finally got on the board with 33 seconds remaining in the half thanks to a Seth Hedrick touchdown catch for a 48-yard score. Hedrick sprinted for most of the yards and hit the pylon with the ball as he was being tackled out of bounds. The two-point conversion failed, so the score was 35-6. The Tigers scored again with 6:32 left on the third-quarter clock as Ethan Brown pushed his way into the end zone on a quarterback sneak from the one-yard line. Again, the two-point conversion failed. Page 2 of 2 - Waynesville's defense played much better in the third quarter, forcing two punts and keeping the Chiefs out of the end zone until the 2:32 mark when McGee scored from one yard out to cap off a drive that started on the Tigers' 21 following a turnover on downs by Waynesville. Drehle attributed it to both sides of the ball cleaning up their play. \"We had some missed tackles and things in the first half, and also getting a good drive and allowing those kids (the defense) to rest a little bit, it all goes together,\" Drehle said. \"I was proud of our kids, they came out and responded to the challenge.\" Kickapoo scored again with 2:44 left in the fourth quarter as Corey Dye picked off a pass around the Tigers' 10-yard line and ran it into the end zone. In the huddle following the game, Drehle stressed to his kids the importance of shaking off what had just happened and getting their minds ready for a battle with the Lakers next week. \"The regular season is over and, regardless of what happened, at this point everyone is 0-0,\" Drehle said to the Daily Guide . \"The only goal you have at this point is to be 1-0 at the end of the week.\" By Derek Dueker   By Derek Dueker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:09:54.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
