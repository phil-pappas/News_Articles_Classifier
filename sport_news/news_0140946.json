Georgia and Gibraltar cannot qualify. The top two in each group qualify, as does the best third-placed team from all the groups, while the other eight third-placed finishers enter a playoff. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:19:07.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
