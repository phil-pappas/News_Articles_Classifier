He has raised her since she was an infant and he is the only father she has known, according to Sabine Parish officials.\nYork and Johnson's mother broke up a few months ago. York was visiting Johnson in Harris County, TX when he reportedly got into an argument with her mother.\nThe mother, Misty Howard, asked him to leave and he left with the 6-year-old.\nSabine Parish authorities say the pair was dropped off at York's mother's house. York's sister Ruby Cartinez says family members warned him they would call 911, they feel their advice seemed to panic York. The mother called the sheriff's office and York took the girl into the woods, according to Sabine Parish officials.\nSeveral agencies including Louisiana State Police, DeSoto Parish Sheriff's Office, Natchitoches Sheriff's Office, Sabine Parish Sheriff's Office, the U.S. Marshall's office and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) participated in the search.\n\"It's been a long day, sure has,\" said Sabine Parish Sheriff Ronny Richardson. \"All we were worried about was getting her out of the woods, all this man-power was worth it to rescue her,\" he said and explained York turned himself after deputies put a little bit of pressure on him.\nYork was taken into custody and was booked into the Sabine Parish Detention Center before being extradited back to Texas to face kidnapping charges.\n\"She's got a few scratches on her, but she's ok,\" said Howard. \"He just made a bad decision and I hate it because she does love him and he loves her,\" she said.\n\"I'm just ready to take my baby home, I appreciate all the help,\" she said.\nThe case remains under investigation.\nCopyright 2015 KSLA .
