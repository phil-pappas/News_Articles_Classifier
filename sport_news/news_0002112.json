He didn't turn the ball over, and truly did give Florida a chance to win. \nSince he's still relatively new to the offense, conventional wisdom suggests Florida making the run game a point of emphasis. It'd theoretically act as a mechanism of ball control, and it'd help to take pressure off of Harris. \nThe only problem is, the ground game hasn't been overly effective. \nFlorida's stable of backs have rushed for only a 2.86 yards-per-attempt average in SEC play. This ranks the Gators dead-last in this category. \nLeading rusher Kelvin Taylor has 463 yards on 129 carries this season. This equates to a 3.6 yards-per-carry average. The group as a whole has run to the tune of a 3.5 yards-per-carry clip. \nFlorida's done a terrific job of not turning the ball over. However as the schedule becomes more difficult, it'll need to become more effective at running the football. \nIt could signal Harris becoming more involved with his legs, on quarterback-designed runs such as draws and zone-read looks. He's also potentially dangerous on broken plays with his scrambling ability. \nThe more yardage Florida can manufacture on the ground, the better chance it has at winning the SEC East. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:28:01.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
