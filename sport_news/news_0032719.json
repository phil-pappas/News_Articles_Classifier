I just make them based on what I think is best for our team.\" \nA highly touted free agent signed out of Boston University in the spring, the 23-year-old O'Connor is only still with the Senators NHL squad because Craig Anderson's backup, Andrew Hammond, is sidelined by a groin injury. The plan was to have O'Connor finish training camp with the big team then head to Binghamton for development. \nO'Connor was credited with two of the Senators three pre-season wins, giving up six goals on 72 shots while posting a 2.98 GAA. He was especially sharp in an exhibition appearances against Carolina in Newfoundland, where he turned aside all 18 pucks that came his way. \nAfter that performance, GM Bryan Murray stated he was impressed with the Sault St. Marie native and he believed O'Connor would be NHL ready early into the year. \nNobody expected it would mean for the home opener, but Anderson, after winning games in Buffalo and a shootout against the Leafs Saturday night, was given a rest against the Habs. \n\"Early in the season you always kind of gage the workload of everybody,\" said Cameron. \"I think all the things are lined up that it's the right decision.\" \nAsked if he thought O'Connor had the makeup to handle the pressures of playing a home opener, Cameron cracked: \"How about I tell you that after the game? \n\"We think it's the right decision,\" he continued. \"We think it's not going to affect him. There's pressure, there's always pressure. If you're going to last in this business, you better learn how to handle it. It's a real opportunity for him.\" \nWith the Habs playing Saturday night in Boston, coach Michel Therrien decided to give Price a break and go with the 25-year-old Condon, who beat Dustin Tokarski out of the backup role with a strong training camp. The undrafted 25-year-old played his first AHL season in 2014-15 for the Habs AHL affiliate in Hamilton, where he posted a 23-19-6 record with a strong .921 save percentage. \nIn 93 minutes of pre-season play for Montreal, Condon stopped all 38 shots he faced.
