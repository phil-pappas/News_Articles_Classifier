But when Henry was called up to play receiver this season, even he wasn’t exactly sure what to expect. Tate knocks off Escambia, eyes district title game \n“This is my first year playing receiver ... I like it a lot,” said Henry, who has racked up 772 reception yards for 7 TDs on 32 catches this season. “It is something new. I just like being on the field.” \nLast week, as Tate clinched a playoff spot, Henry exploded for for 208 receiving yards and three TDs. Henry also added an interception – his fifth of the year – and a touchdown saving tackle on defense. \n“We are staying hungry, we want to go as far as we can this season,” Henry said. “We want to be the team to beat, and I believe we are doing a good job of that. \n“Offensively, our o-line is doing a great job. Our running backs are picking up yards and getting clutch first downs. Our receivers are getting open and running good routes. Sawyer (Smith) has been making good reads and playing really good this year.” \nThough Henry holds fond memories from last Friday’s win, he and the Aggies anxiously await a shot at Choctaw this Friday. \n“It was definitely one of my better games (against Escambia), no doubt,” Henry said. \nCatholic banged up after final district game \nThe Smiley brothers (Abram, 9th grade; Simeon, 12th grade) have a lot in common. \nBoth are impact players for Catholic’s varsity football team (Abram Smiley, No. 4 in area 874 rushing yards heading into last week; Simeon Smiley 2015 PNJ Super Senior). Unfortunately, the similarities don’t stop there as the brothers both suffered injuries in last week’s loss and seem doubtful for this Friday vs. Washington \n“Both of them got hurt against Taylor County, and both won’t play this week (against Washington),” Catholic coach Greg Seibert said. “Simeon has got a MCL sprain ... he got rolled up on. Abram hurt his foot. He kind of jumped over a guy and when he planted his foot, I think he hurt one of his bones.” \nOutside of the Smiley brothers, the injury bug continues to bite Catholic. \n“We also won’t have A.J. Yates this week, who suffered a high-ankle sprain against Taylor County,” Seibert said. \nYates is ranked No. 11 in the area amongst receivers, after hauling in 17 catches for 245 yards and two TDs prior to the Taylor County game. \nCatholic makes mental transition \nIt’s amazing the drama that can be created in prep football when it comes to district play – especially in a three-team district. \nThe Catholic Crusaders – in District 1-3A with Taylor County and Florida High – have felt both the highs and the lows of that scenario. \nIn Week 6, Catholic bested Florida High (4-1 at the time) with a score of 19-13, as Catholic was half way to its goal of being district champion. \nBut after last Friday, the Crusaders took a tumble at home with a 35-26 loss to Taylor County. \nNow, Catholic must play the waiting game as Taylor County and Florida High face off on Oct. 30. \n“Unfortunately, we no longer control our destiny,” Catholic coach Greg Seibert said. “We’ve kind of gotta be Florida High fans. If Florida High beats Taylor County, there will be a shootout. If that doesn’t happen, then we’ll get ready to be the district runner up. The bottom line is our playoff life is still there, it’s just a matter of how it is gonna fit into the rest of our season.” \nReaching crunch time in District 1-5A \nThe fact is, both West Florida and Pensacola High are facing elimination this Friday night. \nFor PHS, it is simple, the Tigers must beat the Mosley Dolphins this Friday or their playoff hopes are over. \nBut a win for PHS over Mosley would make things tricky for the West Florida Jaguars, who face Arnold on Friday. \nFor the Jags’ to be eliminated, West Florida would have to lose to Arnold and Mosley would have to defeat Pensacola. 37 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1LJNQ7h TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:55:43.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
