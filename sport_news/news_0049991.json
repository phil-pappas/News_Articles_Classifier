Preller/Don Welke faction.\" There was no lobbying behind the scenes. The group worked more in concert than it had. The additions of Michael Young and Darren Oliver to provide insights into players' minds and the willingness to hear those opinions were important.\nDaniels and assistant Thad Levine have worked hard to create an inclusive environment in which scouts, administrators and department heads all feel engaged and invested. The results were evident in how well the Rangers adjusted to changing situations as the season evolved.\nDaniels just finished a decade on the job as GM. It is a stress-laden job. Levine, his first hire, has been loyal to the boss and the organization. There is opportunity this fall to start creating a rather seamless line of succession that would allow Levine to ease into the day-to-day role of a GM when Daniels is comfortable with running the organization from the perspective of a president/CEO.\nOn Twitter:\n @Evan_P_Grant", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Evan_P_Grant"], "published": "2015-10-21T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:02:26.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
