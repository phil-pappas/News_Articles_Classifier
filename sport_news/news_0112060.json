Tom Brady is once again making noise about playing until he's close to 50.\nAdChoices Brady said three years ago that he was hoping to play past the age of 40. He's 38 now and absolutely dominating the league with a superb 14 touchdowns against just one interception thrown this season. In light of his success, Brady is once again feeling good enough to say he wants to play another 10 years.\n\"I want to play for a long time, maybe 10 more (years),\" Brady said on a conference call with New York reporters Wednesday ahead of Sunday's Patriots-Jets game.\nBrady has gone down this road many times before and backtracked. Heck, The Boston Herald's Jeff Howe points out that just a month ago, Brady said playing another 10 years might be a stretch.\nBrady was asked 9/23 if he could play 10 more: \"That might be a little bit of a reach at this point.\" Beating the Colts reinvigorated him.\n— Jeff Howe (@jeffphowe) October 21, 2015\nBut Brady is serious about making it a goal.\n\"It's not always up to me; that's what my goals are,\" Brady said via NJ.com's Dom Cosentino . \"That's just what I'm hoping. It'll take a lot to achieve that. Obivously, a team has to want you. I love playing this sport. I love making the commitment to my teammates and my coaches, and hopefully I can go for a long time.\"\nWhen you're playing the best football of your career at age 38, you probably will feel like you can go another 10 years. And why should Brady think about walking away with how well he's doing? The only thing he better worry about is consequences from the league like this for sharing his bold plans.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2015/10/tom_bradys_goal_is_to_play_for_10_more_years.html", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/drew-brees-drug-tested-twice-play-until-45/237067", "https://twitter.com/jeffphowe/status/656953989402120192", "https://twitter.com/jeffphowe/status/656951939612200965", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:22:21.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
