Witty kid. I recently completed my fifth semester teaching our next generation an ethics course at a respected university.\nEthics is a popular course. Then again, it's required for graduation.\nMany of my captive students are like crusty rocks ready to become diamonds but uncertain what to rub up against to get that polish going. Some enroll in graduate programs because they're not getting jobs and have spare time to attend classes.\nSpare time doesn't necessarily translate to good work. Recently, a young woman was intent on overtaking the class discussion, despite missing the reading assignment. The classroom was merely a forum for her opinions that had little to do with the evening's topic.\nWhen her filibuster was cut short, she stormed out. Two pals followed. One complained to the front desk, \"That professor doesn't get it. I pay tuition. She works for me.\"\nThis student apparently viewed the academic front desk like a hotel's concierge that would immediately appease her dissatisfaction.\nWhat drives students to march out of my ethics classroom? Are they dragging in the outsized drama of a reality-show culture?\nClearly, a new level of unbridled frustration is competing with academic discipline.\nMillennials, you literally cannot call yourselves adults until you take this pledge Chris Erskine I admire and adore the millennials.

Below is a pledge all of us should take publicly, as per a bar mitzvah or a wedding, signifying a ceremonial crossing into adulthood.\nNot that I recommend...\n(Chris Erskine) While a university degree remains an indelible mark of achievement, I learned a new term a few years ago. One of my brightest graduate students called himself a \"serial intern.\"\nRecently, a student announced that she steals at her unpaid internship because \"we're unpaid and deserve something\" from so-called employers. This bold student reeled off available office supplies like \"to go\" items on a menu: paper, pens, coffee mugs, small electronics, newspapers and magazines.\nWorking for free sounds a lot like slavery 2.0 and students know it, but I doubt many steal to offset their situation. However, an unpaid internship is too often the path to more unpaid internships after graduation. It's a demoralizing cycle.\nDuring a recent chat, two former students explained the conundrum. Both earned bachelor degrees and dove straight to bottom-tier political jobs — scheduler and campaign driver. Six years later, each worked up to communications director on Capitol Hill. Neither craves a graduate degree. They've interviewed job candidates with master's degrees and zero experience who expect mid-level jobs. One summed up interviewees' expectations with, \"They don't get it.\"\nSheltered students go to college, avoid education Megan McArdle If you've reached that crotchety age I'm at, you may be as mystified as I am by the kids these days — especially by how they're behaving on campus.

I get the naive leftist politics and the wildly irresponsible partying; I even understand the drive toward hamfisted censorship of views they don't...\n(Megan McArdle) Get what? The promise is that more education reaps higher reward.\nWhen that doesn't happen, education is gradually devalued and frustration sets in. Inevitably, classroom structure is challenged. It's as if teachers are viewed as employees hired to reward students with a quid pro quo: I paid the tuition in full, I bought the A.\nI announce that I don't hand out A's like jelly beans, yet more and more students think Easter arrives at the end of each semester.\nFortunately, the smartest students still consistently write strong essays, ace quizzes and explore ideas related to the course work. They are energized marvels to teach — even when they perform a bit like gotcha, broadcast journalists during their moments of airtime.\nI wonder if they like sitting next to classmates who express anger more readily than intellectual curiosity. In truth, my weakest students usually don't lack innate brainpower. They lack power — and they loudly do not like it.\nFrustration doesn't polish many rocks into ethical diamonds. It's more like friction and it plays out in too many headlines, let alone classrooms. Frustration sparks flames that bring people and institutions lower even as they intend to do better.\nMarjorie Kline teaches ethics at George Washington University in the Graduate School of Political Management and works for a communications firm in the Washington, D.C., area.\n Commentary Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55ccecce/turbine/ct-sheltered-college-students-20150813", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d24b6/turbine/ct-millennials-graduate-school-washington-university-perspec-1014-jm-20151013", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bf1fb/turbine/ct-chris-erskine-middle-ages-millennials-pledge-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:20:08.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
