His last title on hard courts came in Doha, Qatar, in January 2014. \nNadal was more consistent than his American opponent, making 25 unforced errors to Sock's 35. After dropping serve twice in the opening set, he only faced one more break point, which he saved. \nIn the women's quarterfinals, Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky rebounded to defeat Sara Errani of Italy 0-6, 6-3, 7-5 to move within one win of cracking the top 10 for the first time in her career. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:09:06.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
