Yavapai's now in second place by a slim margin.ACCAC frontrunner and No. 7-ranked Arizona Western (15-2-1, 46 points) has played one more match than YC, which will compete in its final three regular-season matches on the road in a span of just four days this week.\"We've got to get three wins,\" Yavapai's Reece Weldon said afterward. \"We can't rely on them (Western) to lose. We've just got to focus on our own game.\"The Roughriders visit Glendale C.C. (6-9-1) at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 20; Chandler-Gilbert C.C. (9-7-1) at 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 22; and finish up at 6 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 24, at Phoenix College (12-3-3) - a make-up match postponed due to rain Oct. 6.It's a potentially difficult stretch for Yavapai, which must win out to capture the conference crown, be a regionals' host, and get a first-round bye.\"We have to win out, and we have a difficult task,\" said Pantalione, whose Roughriders notched the squad's 58th all-time win against Pima - the most victories versus any opponent for the program since it began in 1989. \"This was a good win tonight, and we can't get ahead of ourselves.\"If the Roughriders and Western both win all of their remaining matches, Yavapai owns the tiebreaker for the regular-season title. The tiebreaker would come down to how Western and Yavapai fared against defending region champion Pima.The Roughriders, who split their season series with Western, have tied and beaten Pima this fall. Western has a loss and a win versus Pima, meaning YC would win the tiebreaker.\"We can't get ahead of ourselves,\" Yavapai sophomore goalie Greg Patenaude iterated. \"We have three good opponents coming up that are definitely going to give us a match. If we keep playing like the way we are, I don't know how we're going to lose.\"Western, winner of 10 straight matches, hosts Paradise Valley C.C. (4-12) on Tuesday, Oct. 20, and visits Scottsdale C.C. (6-12) on Thursday, Oct. 22. The Matadors clearly have an easier final week than Yavapai. And yet you can never count out the Roughriders, winners of 21 region titles and seven national championships since 1990.On Saturday, Yavapai showed why the hometown club should never be counted out. The Roughriders rolled to a 4-0 lead on Pima only 18 minutes into the match.\"Everything went their way, and they punished every mistake we made,\" Pima coach Dave Cosgrove said. \"Full marks to them.\"Gutierrez, a sophomore defender, scored two of his three goals on the evening within the first 15-plus minutes on pretty assists from speedy sophomore attacker Weldon.Weldon, the conference's leading scorer, booted in two goals of his own. His goal in the 13th minute put Yavapai up 2-0, and his goal to open the second half handed the hosts a commanding 5-1 edge.\"We know that we have the ability to score,\" Weldon said. \"The mindset going in was to score first; don't let them score. And as soon as we get one goal, it just keeps coming and coming.\"Gutierrez put an exclamation point on his superb night in the 80th minute, tallying his third goal for a natural hat trick on a rebound in front of the net. Gutierrez dropped in the goal after receiving a ball initially booted off the foot of sophomore attacker Memo Diaz, who had a goal and an assist in the match.Both of Pima's goals came from sophomore forward Jason Romero, who played his freshman season at Yavapai. Romero helped the Aztecs avoid a first-half shutout when he drilled a 20-yard free kick in the 34th minute to make it 4-1 YC.Romero later answered Weldon's early-second half goal with a 23-yard line-drive shot just outside the box to momentarily cut Yavapai's lead to three, 5-2, before Gutierrez slammed the door shut.Although Yavapai goalie Patenaude allowed two goals, he recorded six key saves. In the first half, Patenaude dove to deflect a few nicely placed balls from Pima that appeared headed for the back of the net. His play was not lost on coach Pantalione afterward.\"Two goals aside, it was really his best match of the season,\" Pantalione said. \"He had cat-like reflexes tonight.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:17:22.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
