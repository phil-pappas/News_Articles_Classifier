The Dodgers escaped from New York with a 3-1 victory in Game 4 Tuesday night, extending their National League Division Series to a decisive Game 5.\nThe win ended a five-start postseason losing streak for Kershaw, stretching to the 2013 National League Championship Series.\n“He definitely wanted this badly,” Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis said.\n“I know people say, ‘Oh, this and that,’” said Dodgers second baseman Howie Kendrick, who wasn’t around when the negative slant on Kershaw’s postseason narrative was being forged. “But he always looks the same. He’s going to play his game.\n“He stepped up big time for us.”\nStep One having finally worked for the Dodgers, this series will now be settled Thursday night at Dodger Stadium with Zack Greinke scheduled to start for the Dodgers and Jacob deGrom for the Mets. The winner will host the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS beginning Saturday.\n“It felt good to get a win tonight. Absolutely,” Kershaw said. “Definitely wanted to send this back to L.A.. I feel confident with Zack going in Game 5 back home.\n“So really just wanted to push it. I really wanted to win tonight, definitely. For a lot of reasons, but obviously most important was just to give Zack a chance.”\nKershaw hadn’t been able to do that in the 2013 NLCS or 2014 NLDS against the Cardinals for reasons that were not always entirely his fault. For one, the bullpen had let the Dodgers down. And offensive support has been lacking.\nPitching on three days rest, Kershaw struck out eight and allowed only three hits in seven dominant innings – the last of those innings, the most important.\nIn his two previous short-rest starts in the playoffs, Kershaw went six innings. He breezed through the first six innings again Tuesday, allowing three baserunners. Only one got past first base – Daniel Murphy cleared the fence in right field for his second solo home run off Kershaw in this series. Six of the last eight Mets hitters before the seventh inning went down on strikes.\n“There’s no curse or anything,” Kershaw said. “Just gotta get through the seventh.”\nTrouble has lurked there in October for Kershaw. A 1-0 game became a 3-0 game in the seventh inning of his Game 1 start against the Mets. Most painfully, last year, six scoreless innings were erased in the span of eight seventh-inning pitches against the St. Louis Cardinals (two singles and Matt Adams’ crushing home run).\n“There’s no secret – the seventh inning has kind of been a tough spot for him these past few postseason outings,” Ellis said. “So the flood of emotions that happens after (Yoenis) Cespedes’ dribbler down the third-base line (for an infield single to lead off the seventh) … Negativity is going to creep in. ‘Here we go again.’”\n1 2 Next Page Related: Jacob DeGrom draws praise from Dodgers - and Game 5 start for Mets Injuries wreak havoc with Yasiel Puig's season Fan critically injured in Dodger Stadium fight after Friday playoff game Cubs down Cardinals to reach NLCS Dodgers-Mets box score", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/game-687455-grandal-mattingly.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/fan-687344-stadium-fight.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/degrom-687462-collins-game.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/cardinalschicago-687365-cubs-.html", "http://sports.ocregister.com/mlb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=351013121&meta=true"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:35:12.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
