Posted: Saturday, October 17, 2015 12:38 am GHS Leopards take out Huskies for first victory By EVAN GRICE Sports Editor gainesvilleregister.com \nAll good things come to those who wait. \nFor the Gainesville Leopards and their fans, their long wait for a first victory of the season has finally come to an end. \nFacing a do-or-die situation in the district standings, the Leopards responded with clutch defensive plays in the fourth quarter to help preserve a 27-19 victory over the Wichita Falls Hirschi Huskies, keeping the Leopards in the hunt for a playoff spot Friday night at Leopard Stadium. \nWith 0:50 left in the fourth quarter and the Huskies driving down the field following an interception inside the red zone off the Leopards, it was GHS player Ruben Hernandez recovering a fumble that was caused by a sack from teammate Manny Rodriquez on Hirschi quarterback Marâ€™tez Vrana, sealing a first victory of the season for the Leopards on Pink Out night. \nRodriquez actually help set up the first touchdown drive of the evening for the Leopards, when he recovered a fumble on the Huskies opening drive at their 49-yard line. \nNine plays later, it was Hunter Turbeville diving his way over the plain for a one-yard touchdown. \nFollowing a bad snap on the extra point attempt, the Leopards held a 6-0 lead with just under six minutes to go in the first quarter. \nHirschi waited a while before responding, but managed to take the lead with just over eight minutes left before halftime when Roman Turner broke loose for an 18-yard touchdown run to make it 7-6 Wichita Falls. \nThings got worse for Gainesville just before halftime, when Vrana found a wide open Zach Downing in the corner of the endzone on a 4th and 22 for a 30-yard touchdown strike, giving the Huskies a 13-6 lead after the missed extra point going into the halfime break. \nIt looked like luck was against the Leopards in the third, when Micheal Bradley had a 20-yard touchdown run called back for holding and chop block penalties. \nHowever, just a couple of plays later, Bradley got his touchdown when Turbeville found him over the middle for a 28-yard strike to tie the game at 13-13 with 6:41 remaining in the third. \nCalion Baker then provided a spark for the Leopards after a defensive stand, when his 40-yard punt return down to the Huskies 23-yard line gave the Leopards just the field position they needed to take the lead. \nGainesville would then embark on another solid drive down the field, picking up yardage in crucial spots to set up the go-ahead touchdown just a couple of minutes later. \nBaker finished what he started with three seconds left in the third when he punched it in from one-yard out to make it 20-13 in favor of Gainesville. \nHowever, the dramatics were far from over in this contest. \nHirschi responded in a big way with a 73-yard touchdown pass from Vrana that found Dominic Davis over his right shoulder, putting the Huskies within one. \nBut, a bad snap on the ensuing extra point meant the Leopards stayed in front at 20-19 with 10:16 left in the fourth. \nThis gave the Leopards all the opportunity they needed to cash in and claim their first victory of the season. \nIt would be Bradley finishing the game off in style for the Leopards, as he dragged a Huskies defender into the endzone, finishing off a 13-yard touchdown run, putting Gainesville up 27-19 with 7:22 left in the fourth. \nGainesville (1-6, 1-1) will look to make it two straight in district play when they travel to play the Burkburnett Bulldogs next Friday night at 7:30 p.m. from Bulldog Stadium.
