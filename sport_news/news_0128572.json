Eastern Hancock moved up due to its success factor – winning sectional championships the last two seasons at the expense of the Knights. \nThe teams will meet a little earlier in this year’s sectional tournament, as teams learned their postseason fates Sunday afternoon. \nNortheastern travels to Eastern Hancock to take on the two-time reigning Class A sectional champions to open IHSAA Class 2A Sectional 38. \n“We’ve known all year we were going to run into them most likely, so it’s not a huge surprise,” Northeastern coach Mike Roeder said Sunday. “It’s a lot of the same probably statements that I made last year – both teams had long season and changed a little bit and had injuries and personnel changes, but we know each other pretty well.” \nAlso in Class 2A Sectional 38, Union County (2-6) travels to Triton Central (4-4), winless Centerville (0-8) visits winless Switzerland County (0-8). \nMilan (3-5) visits Indianapolis Howe (5-3) to decide the opponent of the Northeastern-Eastern Hancock winner. \n“They’re in kind of the same shape we are, but we’re happy with the draw,” Centerville coach Perry Irwin said. “I don’t mind doing that two-and-a-half hour draw to play them \nI don’t really know anything about them expect, but we’re happy with the draw, and if we win, we get to play Week 2 at home.” \nIn Class 2A Sectional 36, Winchester (6-2) visits Eastern (Greentown) 2-6, with the player advancing to meet the winner of the Madison Grant (2-6)-Elwood (4-4) winner. Alexandria (3-5) plays at Eastbrook (8-0) with the winner meeting the Blackford (0-8) at Taylor (3-5) winner. \nWinchester and Northeastern both advanced to sectional finals last year. \n“We’ve never played Eastern before, so that’s going to be a challenge,” Winchester coach Mike Jones said. “… Obviously, film will have to help us a great deal. … I like playing folks that we don’t see on a regular basis, it makes you play hard and become smarter.” \nIn Class A Sectional 46, Hagerstown (4-4) visits Tri High (2-6) with the winner playing the Indianapolis Shortridge (2-6) at Lincoln (3-5) winner. Indianapolis Lutheran (4-4) visits Knightstown (2-6) and the winner meets the Tindley (1-4) at Indiana Deaf (6-2) winner. \nUnion City (4-4) hosts Southern Wells (5-3) in Class A Sectional 44, while the winner gets the Adams Central (8-0) at Wes-Del (3-5) winner, Shenandoah (6-2) visits Tri-Central (8-0) and the winner meets the Anderson Prep (3-5) at Monroe Central (7-1) winner. \n“There’s some good programs in that sectional and we’d like to think we’re one of them,” Roeder said. “In these kind of games you go out and play and try to make fewer mistakes and see that happens.” \nIHSAA Sectionals Game 1: Southern Wells (5-3) at Union City (4-4) Game 2: Adams Central (8-0) at Wes-Del (3-5) Game 3: Shenandoah (6-2) at Tri-Central (8-0) Game 4: Anderson Prep Academy (3-5) at Monroe Central (7-1) \nClass A Sectional 46 Game 1: Hagerstown (4-4) at Tri (2-6) Game 2: Indianapolis Shortridge (2-6) at Lincoln (3-5) Game 3: Indianapolis Lutheran (4-4) at Knightstown (2-6) Game 4: Tindley (1-4) at Indiana Deaf (6-2) \nClass 2A Sectional 36 Game 1: Alexandria (3-5) at Eastbrook (8-0) Game 2: Blackford (0-8) at Taylor (3-5) Game 3: Madison-Grant (2-6) at Elwood (4-4) Game 4: Winchester (6-2) at Eastern (Greentown) (2-6) \nClass 2A Sectional 38 Game 1: Union County (2-6) at Triton-Central (4-4) Game 2: Centerville (0-8) at Switzerland County (0-8) Game 3: Northeastern (6-2) at Eastern Hancock (8-0) Game 4: Milan (3-5) and Indianapolis Howe (5-3) Buy Photo \nNortheastern's Alec Hughes runs past Lincoln's Lucas Dautrich during a football game Friday, Oct. 9, 2015 in Cambridge City.
