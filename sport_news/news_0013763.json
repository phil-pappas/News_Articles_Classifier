I’ve been fined a few times by the FA and when I asked, I didn’t get an answer.” \nPulis wants the League Managers Association and the Premier League to call a meeting of all managers to discuss similar cases that have occurred this season. \n“We have to have a meeting to find out what’s going on,” he told reporters yesterday. \nThe FA later told Reuters that money from fines “is all put back into football, including the grass roots of the game.” \nMourinho will be hoping to avoid any further controversy today in what Chelsea would normally expect to be a straightforward home game against Aston Villa, which has a poor record at Stamford Bridge. \nBut the champion itself is on a bad run and in the bottom six of the Premier League, after only one win in its last five league games and one in four at home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:30:39.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
