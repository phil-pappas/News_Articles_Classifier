Barrett over Cardale Jones at quarterback 7:06 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015 | Filed in: College Football Comments 0 ﻿ \nThe starting quarterback job at Ohio State is J.T. Barrett’s now. Though maybe “for now” is more appropriate. \nBuckeyes coach Urban Meyer announced Tuesday that Barrett would replace Cardale Jones as the starter when No. 1 Ohio State plays at Rutgers on Saturday. \nThis was no unexpected plot twist. The move seemed inevitable after Barrett accounted for four touchdowns in relief of Jones against Penn State last weekend. \nBarrett could take the job and run with it, and the quarterback questions would end in Columbus. But as Meyer said after the 38-10 victory over the Nittany Lions, the Buckeyes will do whatever it takes to win. \n“Cardale is going to be a very active part, too,” Meyer said Tuesday during the Big Ten coaches’ conference call. “Hopefully, we’ll keep him very much involved. So it was a difficult decision. But red-zone production and third-down production were the two areas that made the difference. (Barrett) earned that with the way he played Saturday.” \nBarrett helped the Buckeyes (7-0) break out of a red-zone funk, guiding the offense from inside the 20 into the end zone six times in six trips two weeks ago against Maryland. The trend continued against Penn State. Barrett ran for two touchdowns and threw for two more in six red-zone trips. Another resulted in a field goal. \nThe 6-foot-5-inch, 250-pound Jones has one of the strongest arms in college football, but the Buckeyes have not been able to use it to exploit defenses down the field. Last year, when Jones took over in the postseason, field-stretching receiver Devin Smith became a force. Theses Buckeyes don’t have that kind of vertical threat. \n“I have two great guys that I have a tremendous amount of respect for. I’m just trying to do the right thing,” Meyer said. \nMichigan: Punter Blake O’Neill is shrugging off the fact that perhaps millions of people have discovered who he is this week. \n“I’m happy to play for Michigan football,” he said Tuesday. “You choose to play at the college level, you take the good and the bad.” \nWith seconds remaining in last Saturday’s game, O’Neill bobbled a low snap, and Jalen Watts-Jackson returned the fumble 38 yards to give Michigan State a stunning 27-23 win over the Wolverines. \n“It’s been very interesting — that’s for sure,” said O’Neill, who has been the target of attacks on social media. “There’s been a lot of support from the Michigan fan base, from teammates and even people back home. It’s funny that a game here can get all the way to Australia, but it did.” \nHe said his instincts from playing Australian rules football kicked in, prompting him to try to punt the ball over his head after losing control of it. \n“We’re taught to pick it up and move it on,” O’Neill said. “That’s completely on me.” \nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh said after the game that he wished O’Neill had fallen on the football, so that Michigan State would have needed a Hail Mary pass to win the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:01:46.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
