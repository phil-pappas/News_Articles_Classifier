The Bulldogs are 4-3 and 2-1 in Conference USA with five league games left to play, four of which come against C-USA West opponents. \n\"The sky is falling because we lost to a Big 12 team on the road in triple overtime and an (Southeastern Conference) team on the road,\" Holtz said sarcastically at his weekly Monday press conference. \"I'm not ready to throw this team under the bus and say they're not very good. I'm not ready to do that. I've been proud of what we've been able to accomplish.\" \nTech, which hosts Middle Tennessee on Saturday, is tied for first in the C-USA West Division with Southern Miss and Rice. Tech plays at Rice on Halloween weekend and hosts Southern Miss in November, two games that will likely determine the outcome of the conference race. \nHoltz's comments are consistent with those he made last week, indicating how Tech puts all its eggs in conference games. He went even further when discussing nonconference games, saying \"You win, you win. You lose, you lose.\" \nTranslation: the Bulldogs' goals haven't changed or veered off course. \n\"We've lost the national championship at this point. That's what we've lost,\" he said. \"I don't know what the oddsmakers in Vegas said at the beginning of the season of the year, but I don't think we were one of the favorites.\" \nThe story of Tech's season to date is an inability to string together 60-minute efforts. \nTech played well in the second half against Western Kentucky, but ran out of time in a 41-38 loss. Against Kansas State, Tech controlled the game for three and a half quarters before the Wildcats won in overtime. This past weekend, Tech led Mississippi State 14-0 then proceeded to commit three egregious errors — a blocked punt, a roughing the punter call and an interception that was returned for a touchdown. Senior linebacker Nick Thomason says Louisiana Tech needs to put the little pieces together in final 5 games \n\"This is really where we have to get it all together,\" Tech linebacker Nick Thomason said. \"We haven't played a complete game yet. We've played good, but not great. If we can start putting every little piece together then we'll finish the season strong.\" \nThe \"good, but not great\" ordeal dates back to 2014 when Tech had plenty of highs and lows and missed opportunities. Still, the Bulldogs managed to play for a conference title. \nDecimated is a strong word, but Tech has been plagued by injuries this year. Star running back Kenneth Dixon has missed the past two games with an ankle injury, and his status is up in the air for Middle Tennessee. \nTech has three more games left until its only open date of the season, which Holtz said is \"badly\" needed. \n\"We have not had our five starting skill players all play in the same game yet. It will be great to have Carlos (Henderson) and Paul (Turner) and Kenneth and Conner (Smith) and Trent (Taylor) and have all those guys on the field together so we can really see what this offense is capable of doing when it's operating on all cylinders,\" he said. \n\"For the average person that looks at a win and a loss record and evaluates a team, I look at the body of work right now. I really like the growth and the development and the maturity of the young players on this team.\" Holtz disappointed in pass defense after MSU loss \nThe body of work in Tech's four wins have come from teams with a combined 9-16 record — FIU (3-4), UL Lafayette (2-3), Southern (3-3) and UTSA (1-6). As for the three losses, WKU, Kansas State and Mississippi State have a combined 14-6 mark. Overall, Tech's seven opponents this year have a 23-22, good for a .511 winning percentage. \nAnd in all three losses, Tech's pass defense and mental miscues on special teams have reared its head. Tech ranks eighth in C-USA in pass defense, allowing 263.1 yards per game, but those numbers are propped up by games against Southern and UL Lafayette, two teams with subpar passing quarterbacks. \nTech does have the top-ranked run defense in the conference and the No. 3-ranked total defense to go along with the third-best scoring offense. \n\"What we've done to this point, statistically, is irrelevant. It's really what we do going forward from here. I like where we are right now,\" Holtz said. \"We control our division. We control our own destiny.\" 2 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1LH5Dfj TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:33:51.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
