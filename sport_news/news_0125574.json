Both teams finished the regular season with shutout victories and both teams have two shutouts this year. \n“It’s certainly an opportunity and that’s how we’re going to look at it,” said Northeastern coach Mike Roeder, who is seeking his 97th career head-coaching victory. \nThe winner advances to play the winner of the Milan at Indianapolis Howe game while the Centerville-Switzerland County winner would face the Union County at Triton Central winner. \nClass A Sectional 46 also features three TEC teams with Hagerstown (5-4) traveling to Tri (2-7) with the winner advancing to meet the Indianapolis Shortridge (2-6) at Lincoln (3-6) winner. In the other bracket, Indianapolis Lutheran (5-4) visits Knightstown (2-7) and Tindley (1-5) travels to Indiana Deaf (7-2). \nIn Class A Sectional 44, Union City (4-5) hosts Southern Wells (6-3), with the winner meeting the Adams Central (8-1) at Wes-Del (4-5) winner. \nShenandoah (7-2) plays at Tri-Central (9-0) with the winner meeting the Anderson Prep (3-6) at Monroe Central (7-2) winner. \nIn Class 2A Sectional 36, Alexandria (3-6) is at Eastbrook (9-0), Blackford (0-9) is at Taylor (3-6), Madison-Grant (2-7) is at Elwood (5-4) and Winchester (7-2) is at Eastern (Greentown) (3-6). \nWinchester seeks to advance to a second straight sectional championship game. \n“At this point, you just have to let the chips fall where they will,” Winchester coach Mike Jones said. “… All of these guys are in our region. It gives us an opportunity to showcase our kids and give them a chance to play in the North-South All-Star game.\" \nIHSAA Sectionals Game 1: Southern Wells (6-3) at Union City (4-5) Game 2: Adams Central (8-1) at Wes-Del (4-5) Game 3: Shenandoah (7-2) at Tri-Central (9-0) Game 4: Anderson Prep Academy (3-6) at Monroe Central (7-2) \nClass A Sectional 46 Game 1: Hagerstown (5-4) at Tri (2-7) Game 2: Indianapolis Shortridge (2-6) at Lincoln (3-6) Game 3: Indianapolis Lutheran (5-4) at Knightstown (2-7) Game 4: Tindley (1-5) at Indiana Deaf (7-2) \nClass 2A Sectional 36 Game 1: Alexandria (3-6) at Eastbrook (9-0) Game 2: Blackford (0-9) at Taylor (3-6) Game 3: Madison-Grant (2-7) at Elwood (5-4) Game 4: Winchester (7-2) at Eastern (Greentown) (3-6) \nClass 2A Sectional 38 Game 1: Union County (3-6) at Triton-Central (5-4) Game 2: Centerville (0-9) at Switzerland County (0-9) Game 3: Northeastern (7-2) at Eastern Hancock (9-0) Game 4: Milan (4-5) at Indianapolis Howe (6-3) 5 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1LJkF47 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:38:22.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
