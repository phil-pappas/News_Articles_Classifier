With the newly available roster spot, the Bears signed defensive lineman Bruce Gaston. He appeared in two games with the Green Bay Packers this season, and played his high school football at St. Rita of Cascia High School.

He only made one tackle and had two assisted tackles in four regular season games this year. With Ferguson out of the lineup, there are several options to replace him at defensive end, but injuries could play a factor. Both Jeremiah Ratliff and Will Sutton are listed as questionable on the Bears’ injury report ahead of their game Sunday against the Detroit Lions, so there are still plenty of questions to answer before Ferguson’s replacement is officially revealed.
