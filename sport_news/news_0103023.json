Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow KENNESAW — North Cobb was faced with a tough task in defending its state championship, with both Johns Creek and Walton in its portion of the Class bracket.The Lady Warriors fell to the No. 2 seed after losing to Harrison in the Area 4 tournament. Meanwhile, Johns Creek, the state’s second-ranked team, could only finish as a No. 3 seed after losing twice in its area tournament.That left North Cobb with a tough first-round draw, and it couldn’t find an answer for Johns Creek’s relentless hitting, blocking and serving after the first set, losing 22-25, 25-16, 25-15, 25-14.North Cobb, which will graduate three seniors, including career assists leader Taylor Parrish, finished the season with a 34-16 record, beating eight teams ranked in the top 10.“We’re upset we lost, but our seniors were proud of how we played as a whole,” junior outside hitter Moriah Hopkins said, “and the juniors are ready to come out swinging next season.” The first set was evenly matched as anticipated before North Cobb’s four-point service run broke a 19-all tie to help it claim the set.Johns Creek (38-7) then took over, doing little wrong in the next three sets.“It usually takes us a set to warm up,” said Johns Creek coach Beth Hopkins, whose team will travel to Walton on Tuesday. “We always play better after the first set.”In the first set, Johns Creek committed seven unforced errors, and North Cobb had just four. But in the next three sets combined, North Cobb made 22 unforced errors to Johns Creek’s nine.A few of those errors came on passing as North Cobb attempted to get around four different Johns Creek hitters. Mikaela Gauthreaux surpassed 1,000 career kills and finished the match with 21. Selah Malcolm added 10 kills, Crystal Childs had seven and Madeline Savage six. Even with Molly Pember’s 18 digs and Jenna Woodruff’s 17 on the back row, North Cobb struggled to get the ball to its own hitters once Johns Creek heated up.“Our passing was unpredictable, which made our hitting predictable,” North Cobb coach James Auld said. “If you’re not passing well, there’s not a lot you can do. We got frustrated by a talented front row.” Hopkins led North Cobb with nine kills, Shannon Callan added eight and Lizzie Daniel finished with seven.Johns Creek set up many of its points with its jump serves. Jessica Pia used her power to launch a late third-set run to help the Lady Gladiators pull away and Savage escaped for a four-point run to set the tone in the fourth.“They served more aggressively than we did,” Hopkins said. “They kept serving the ball hard at us, and it was hard for us to put it up every time.” A 5-1 lead in the fourth set lead was enough for Johns Creek as North Cobb didn’t win a point on serve until the Lady Gladiators led 14-7. In the Lady Warriors’ seven previous serves, Johns Creek won five on first-ball kills.Johns Creek also outplayed North Cobb defensively at the net. Childs, Savage and Caroline Mohler each had three block-assists, with Childs and Clara Kidney providing solo blocks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:35:24.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
