Ngata and Ebron actually missed the past two while Bell sat the last three.\nUnfortunately, the Lions were still without strong safety James Ihedigbo (quad) and tight end Brandon Pettigrew (knee), both of whom missed the game against the Bears. Nickel cornerback Josh Wilson (undisclosed) was also an observer, and linebacker DeAndre Levy (hip) remains out and will miss an extended period of time.\nWhile the 1-5 Lions could use as many healthy players as possible, the return of Ngata would be especially important as the Lions welcome star Minnesota running back Adrian Peterson to Ford Field.\n“Obviously, a guy that big with that kind of experience against a team that runs the ball a lot, there’s no question he could help us,” coach Jim Caldwell said Wednesday.\nRookie cornerback Alex Carter (ankle) said last week he planned to practice this week as he’s now eligible to practice after starting the year on injured reserve with designation for return. However, he was a spectator on Wednesday.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com\ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:03:52.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
