He noted that he had played for dozens of coaches of all statures and from all parts of the globe. And, he said, “There’s no perfect coach.”\n Fox Video Featuring Donald Trump Angers United States Soccer Fans OCT. 9, 2015 Javier Hernández’s Spirits Rise, as Mexico Prepares to Face U.S. OCT. 8, 2015 U.S. Sees FIFA as Victim and Its Leaders as Wrongdoers OCT. 9, 2015 Sepp Blatter and Other Top Officials Are Suspended, Deepening FIFA’s Turmoil OCT. 8, 2015 Sports of The Times: With or Without Its Captain, FIFA Seems to Be Capsizing OCT. 8, 2015 This has been an interesting time for Klinsmann, who has held his job since 2011. He is a year removed from leading the United States to what was generally regarded as a positive World Cup performance in Brazil, almost a full three years before the next one in 2018. As he and his players convened in the Los Angeles area to prepare for Saturday’s game against Mexico to determine which national team would advance to the Confederations Cup in 2017, he was facing for the first time an extended period in which fans and pundits have openly doubted his performance and aptitude.\n Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nIt was bad enough for them that the team had staggered to a fourth-place finish this summer at the Gold Cup, the regional championship. A 4-1 loss in a September exhibition against Brazil seemed to lay bare the various ways Klinsmann and his players were falling short of expectations.\nUpon joining the program Klinsmann declared that he would create a proactive, attacking team, yet his players lately have looked mostly ponderous. He said the team would have a strong identity, but instead he has tinkered endlessly, without much to show for it. Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, has said Klinsmann’s job is not in jeopardy. But the chorus of unrest has been unmistakable.\nTaylor Twellman, who played 30 games for the national team and now works as an analyst for ESPN, said he thought coaches faced a different set of challenges after their first four-year World Cup cycle, with familiarity a primary obstacle to getting the best out of players. Noting that the team had also secured big wins overseas on Klinsmann’s watch, he said a lull could be natural.\nOn Soccer A regular analytical column looking at “the beautiful game” around the world.
