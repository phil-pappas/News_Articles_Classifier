She also qualified for the 2012 United States Olympic Trails in four different events. \nVernon’s competitive spirit paired with hard work, is what got her to the pinnacle of her 18-year-long swimming career. \nHowever, she's worked against her competitive nature while training for the sixth annual AthHalf, held on Sunday. \nVernon says the hardest part is pacing herself while also running on a knee she had surgery to repair last summer. \n“My lower extremities were limited until I finished in May,” Vernon said. “I didn’t want to re-hurt them, and [my teammates] basically joked and told me you’re an idiot. Doctors told that me that I should not run again. Well, I want to run a half marathon.” \nVernon started preparing for the half marathon six weeks ago, when friends and former teammates encouraged her to give it a try. Vernon said the training for swimming and running is different, but her mindset is similar. Her former assistant swimming coach Stefanie Williams said the transition from land to water can be hard because swimmers spend so much of their time in the water that land is almost foreign territory. \nVernon said the hardest adjustment was her feet pounding on the concrete. \n“The training is similar in ways. If you don’t swim for four days, you’re out of shape and I feel like it’s the same with running,” Vernon said. “If you don’t run for like a week, you get out of shape. I felt like I was just back in swimming again.” \nVernon runs 10 miles around Athens as part of her training regimen. The inclines and declines of Athens provide natural resistance to help add intensity. Resistance is a part of the training process that Vernon is accustomed to from swimming. \nPushing off the blocks and swimming different strokes led to Vernon's knee injury prior to her senior season. \nHer freshman season started similarly to her last year. \nShe came to Georgia with a shoulder injury and could not complete any overhead movements in the water for five months. She said all she could do was kick and she thinks overcompensating with her lower body could have contributed to the knee injuries she sustained throughout her career. \nShoulder injuries may be more common for swimmers, but knee injuries can occur, especially among swimmers who compete in breaststroke events. The use of the knees in this event can create stress on ligaments on the inner part of the knee. \nVernon was determined to finish her senior season strong despite long sessions of rehab. \n“There were probably moments where she just wanted to stop, but she is not a quitter,” Williams said. “It wasn’t rainbows all the time when she got back, but she pushed through. There were times I had to kick her in the butt, and times I had to lift her up. But one thing I never did was give up on her.” \nThe process paid off for Vernon in her last season. She ranks sixth in the 400 individual medley in school history \n“She was really determined to make the NCAA team senior year,” former UGA swimmer and friend Lauren Harrington said. “She really wanted to finish out strong. Against all odds she did and it was cool to see her be able to be on the team her senior year.\" \nVernon’s determination will guide her through her first half marathon Sunday. She'd never run more than three consecutive miles before training for the Athens Half. \nWilliams, who completed a triathlon last month, told Vernon to invest in a good pair of running shoes to help her prevent reoccurring knee problems. Harrington believes if anyone can make the transition from swimming to running after coming back from a knee injury, it's Vernon. \n“It’s a testament to her competitiveness,” Harrington said. “For anyone else it would be hard, but for Nicole it doesn’t surprise me. She loves to go to that extra gear. Without swimming, she probably need another outlet to transfer that energy to.” \nVernon has created ways to deal with tough training days through the competitive mindset she honed in the water. \n“I try to look right in front of me,” Vernon said. “We had this mental coach come in and speak to us for swimming, and he said step by step you’re going to get to your goals. If you look up at this huge hill, you will get discouraged. But if you just focus on the only step you have in front of you, you will be fine.” \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
