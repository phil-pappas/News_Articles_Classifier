Stefon Diggs made a spectacular diving catch in the end zone on a ball Bridgewater slightly overthrew, and Kyle Rudolph had to make a one-handed catch in the end zone on Bridgewater’s other touchdown.\nMost important for Bridgewater, even while getting hit with regularity, he did not commit a turnover while passing for 316 yards.\nAs bad as Detroit may be, the Vikings needed to begin proving they could win division games on the road. They’re 4-2 with a game at Chicago next Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:49:17.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
