Tennessee is seeking to turn its season around after losing three of its last four games. In each of its three losses, Tennessee led by at least 13 points. \nKEY MATCHUP \nGeorgia running game vs. Tennessee run defense: Nick Chubb leads a Georgia rushing attack that has averaged 244.5 yards per game and 6.5 yards per carry to rank second in the SEC in both categories. Tennessee just gave up 275 yards rushing in a 24-20 loss to Arkansas last week while allowing the Razorbacks to dominate time of possession in the second half. It's asking too much to expect Tennessee to shut down Chubb and Co., but the Volunteers at least must do a better job of handling the run than they did last week. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nGeorgia: Chubb. He has rushed for at least 100 yards in 13 straight games to hold the longest active streak among all Football Bowl Subdivision players. That 13-game streak also ties Herschel Walker's school record. Chubb has run for 745 yards and has averaged 8.2 yards per carry. He ranks third among all FBS players with 149 yards rushing per game. \nTennessee: RB Jalen Hurd. This bruising back has rushed for 492 yards and seven touchdowns while averaging 4.7 yards per carry. He has gained at least 90 yards in each of Tennessee's four games against FBS opponents and had over 100 yards against Bowling Green, Oklahoma and Florida. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nGeorgia has won five straight games in this series, but the last two matchups have been decided by just three points each, including a 34-31 overtime decision in Knoxville in 2013. ... Tennessee's Evan Berry has returned two kickoffs for touchdowns and is the nation's second-leading kickoff returner. ... Georgia is ranked second in the SEC in rushing, while Tennessee is third. ... Tennessee has lost 28 of its last 29 games against ranked teams. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:45:11.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
