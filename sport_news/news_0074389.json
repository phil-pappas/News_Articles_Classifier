But she was mildly confused when Sheri, the wife of head coach Fred Harvey, offered this. \n“I guess you really wanted to go to Alaska,” Sheri said. \nThe Wolf Pack as a team had not shot well enough to qualify for the NCAA championships the following month in Fairbanks, Alaska, and Capaul, just a freshman for the Wolf Pack, didn’t really know all of the college rules yet. In fact, Capaul didn’t realize her 594 score had just qualified her for NCAAs. \n“I asked her, ‘What are you talking about?’” Capaul said. “I didn’t know you could qualify individually.” \nThat’s exactly what Capaul did, becoming one of Nevada’s rare freshmen to make it to NCAAs and one of only 44 in the nation to compete in nationals last season. That blissful naiveté has described the career of Capaul, the best athlete at Nevada you’ve never heard of. But just last month Capaul tied Nevada’s record in air rifle, shooting a 597, which stands as one of the top marks in the nation. \nCapaul fell into the sports by accident. Growing up in Sutter, Calif., where about half of the Wolf Pack team is from, Capaul did some trapshooting and hunted doves and peasants in middle school. But she had no idea shooting was even a sport until she tagged along with her younger sisters to a 4H event. \n“I couldn’t drive yet, so my dad picked my little sister up at school and took her to practice and I had to tag along,” Capaul said. “My little sister was shooting in 4H, so I was stuck going to one of the practices with them and I immediately said, ‘I want to try this.’ Then my little sister quit. She got bored with it.” \nBut the 5-foot-2 Capaul, who says she’s not sporty, found her calling. Capaul picked up rifle as a high school freshman and was one of 150 in the nation to qualify for national junior Olympics one year later. \n“I started out pretty good,” Capaul said with a look of aw-shucks. “Natural talent, I guess.” \nShooting for fun, Capaul didn’t discover rifle could take her to college until she was a high school junior and one of her ex-classmates, Greta Ochsner, told her they had a team at Nevada. Since Nevada was loaded with kids from Sutter, a town of 2,904 north of Sacramento, Capaul wanted to go to a different college. Ole Miss was interested, but Nevada’s scholarship offer was better, so she headed to Reno. \nImmediately, Capaul became one of the best shooters on the nationally ranked Wolf Pack. \n“She surprised us,” said coach Fred Harvey, who’s in his 20th season at Nevada. “I knew she was good, but at this point she’s great. Her ability to focus is great. The ability to get that shot off. It’s probably what separates her from the vast majority of shooters in the country. She’s able to deliver the shot.” \nThat was especially the case in the first match of this season against Ohio State. \nThe Buckeyes are coached by Ryan Tanoue, a Wolf Pack alum and four-time All-American who won the NCAA individual title in air rifle in 2002. Tanoue also set the Wolf Pack’s all-time air-rifle mark, a 597 in 2003. With Tanoue on hand, Capaul took aim at his record mark, although not without a rough start. \nIn air rifle, shooters have 75 minutes to complete six rounds (each round has 10 shots). The high score on each shot is a 10, meaning a max score of 600. After a perfect warmup, Capaul’s first shot was a nine. \n“I thought, ‘Oh, great,’” Capaul said. \nCapaul finished the first round with all 10s but had another 9 in the second round. She followed with three perfect rounds and entered the final round needing 10 perfect 10s to break Tanoue’s record. \n“I got nervous once I got to 40 shots,” said Capaul, who triggers about one shot per minute. “I said, ‘Wow, I could beat Ryan right now.’ I was at a 398 and I had 20 shots left. I said, ‘I have to do this.’ On my last target I was super nervous. I was shaking so bad my knees were weak. I thought I was going to fall over. It was bad. But I turned around and all of my teammates were smiling saying, ‘You got this.’” \nAfter more than 45 straight perfect 10s Capaul’s third-to-last shot was a nine before she finished with two 10s to tie the Wolf Pack record (Capaul’s 597 would have been second in NCAAs last season). And after she finished her round, Tanoue, the best shooter in Nevada history, offered congratulations. \n“He was very happy for her,” Harvey said. “It was a remarkable afternoon.” \nHarvey said Capaul is already one of the five best shooters he’s coached in his two decades at Nevada. He believes her future could lead to an NCAA title or Olympic team berth if Capaul stays with it. \n“If she stays on this path and this is something that she wants she could be on the national team,” Harvey said. “Shooting that 597 was a huge boost for her confident, and I think it was important for the entire team. There are other members of the team now that are taking note of that and improving. I think there are a number of other shooters looking at Emily and saying, ‘Oh, I can get there, too.’” “Now that I shot a 597, in my head I’m thinking, ‘I can do that, too! I can shoot a 600.'” Emily Capaul \nWithout rifle, Capaul said she never would have come to Nevada or gone to a four-year college. Now, she’s studying forensic psychology, due in large part to her love of the television series CSI. She’d like to work for the FBI after college, but for now her goal is clear: She’s gunning for the perfect 600. \n“I want to shoot a 600,” Capual said. “One girl last year from TCU (Mindy Miles) shot a 600 and everybody was, like, ‘Oh, my, gosh!’ I’m pretty sure she was the only person to shoot a 600 last year. Now that I shot a 597, in my head I’m thinking, ‘I can do that, too! I can shoot a 600.’” \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
