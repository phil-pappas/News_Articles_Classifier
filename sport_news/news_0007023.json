He then created a prototype of his idea.\nIdeal for hunters and target shooters, this device provides a way to make a rifle safer. It helps prevent accidental or unauthorized shooting, as well as promotes peace of mind. It also is faster than 73 and 92 Winchesters. The idea is patent pending.\nThe original design was submitted to the St. Louis office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
