Ask the experts! \nThe two-quarterback tango for Ohio State was drawing rave reviews again by halftime of the game on Saturday night against Penn State, but it was the J.T. Barrett show by the time the Buckeyes’ 38-10 win was in the books.\nUrban Meyer sent in Barrett, his red-zone specialist, a bit early, and then for good from any spot on the field late in the third quarter. His option-run threat was exactly the medicine for a Penn State defense determined stop Cardale Jones, more of a pocket passer.\n“I thought J.T came in and played great,” Meyer said after Barrett ran for two touchdowns and threw for two more. “He gives you that dual threat.”\nWith the offense struggling to find consistent punch under Jones, and facing a second-and-13 at the Penn State 31-yard line on the first play of the second quarter, Meyer inserted Barrett.\nHe handed to Ezekiel Elliott for 6 yards, kept for 12 on an option, handed to Elliott for 8, then kept on another option for 5 yards for the go-ahead touchdown at 13:43 of the second. By quarter’s end, Barrett had entered in his regular spot, inside the 20, and directed two more TDs, one on a 10-yard run around right end by Elliott and the other on another keeper of 13 yards to give OSU a 21-3 halftime lead.\nGoing back to the previous win over Maryland, Ohio State was 12 of 12 on scoring touchdowns once inside the red zone and went 6 of 6 last night.\nSack with bad wrist Defensive tackle Tommy Schutt made the sack of the game — his grab of Penn State quarterback Christian Hackenberg’s right ankle on fourth-and-2 from the OSU 13 with 10 minutes left. And Schutt did it with a right hand that was wrapped up tight in the post-game media room.\n“It’s something I’m trying not to worry too much about and just keep playing hard with my guys,” Schutt said.\nThat was especially true on that turning play. Hackenberg wanted to throw, but as the pocket started to collapse, he stepped forward with an apparent attempt to run. He had done the same thing against Indiana the week before and went 5 yards for a touchdown. But Schutt shut the door this time.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \n“Our coverage was great, he had nowhere to throw the ball, he stepped up and I came off a block and made the play,” Schutt said.\nWilliams ejected Linebacker Camren Williams was ejected with 5:31 to play after a crown-of-the-helmet hit on Akeel Lynch. The ejection was upheld after video review by the official in the press box. Williams will miss the first half of the game at Rutgers on Saturday night as a result, a team spokesman said.\n“We don’t teach tackling like that,” Meyer said.\nJordan signs Offensive lineman Michael Jordan, who committed to Ohio State months ago, had some recruiting analysts on edge as he stepped to the podium at his high school in Plymouth, Mich., to make what he had advertised as being a “huge” announcement.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \nJordan took the moment to reconfirm his pledge to the Buckeyes, to say he was going to enroll in January and to celebrate his invitation to play in the U.S. Army All-America game. To further seal his commitment to Ohio State, he signed his Big Ten tender for financial aid, which binds the Buckeyes to him unless he changes his mind between now and January.\nToo cautious on defense Penn State defensive end Garrett Sickels logged a season-high eight tackles. The sophomore said the Nittany Lions’ defense held its own in the first and third quarters, but became cautious in the second and fourth quarters, allowing OSU’s offense to find its playmakers for big gains.\n“We prepared well, but obviously not enough. I think we just have to settle down more and play our responsibilities a little bit better,” Sickels said. “(Barrett)\nmakes them more dynamic and gives them more options.”\nDispatch Reporter Andrew Erickson contributed to this story. \ntmay@dispatch.com \n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:35:57.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
