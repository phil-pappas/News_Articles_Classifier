It was the biggest setback since orders dropped 3.7 percent in December.\nDemand in a key category that serves as a proxy for business investment slipped 0.8 percent in August, following solid gains in June and July.\nManufacturing has been under stress this year as a strong dollar has hurt export sales. The big fall in energy prices has also led to cutbacks by energy companies.\nOrders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, fell 2.3 percent in August, slightly worse than the 2 percent decline reported in a preliminary report. Demand for nondurable goods such as paper, chemicals and food dropped 1.1 percent.\nThe overall weakness was fueled by a 5.9 percent fall in demand for commercial aircraft, a volatile category that was down for the second month. Orders for machinery rose 0.8 percent, but orders for computers and other electronic products were off 0.5 percent.\nOn Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management said that its manufacturing index slid to a reading of 50.2 in September, its lowest level since May 2013.\nThe rising dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive in foreign markets, while weakness in China, the world's second biggest economy, is adding pressure to the global economy.\nThe overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the April-June quarter, a sharp increase after an anemic 0.6 percent rise in the first quarter. Economists are forecasting that growth in the current July-September quarter will slow slightly to around 2.5 percent.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
