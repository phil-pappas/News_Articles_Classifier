Therefore I instructed the Campaign to return my contribution.\"\n\"I do not believe in or tolerate personal or professional discrimination of any kind,\" McNair's statement continues. \"I also believe that we Houstonians should have an ordinance that unites our community and provides a bold statement of non-discrimination. I encourage all Houstonians to vote on November 3.\"\nThe bulk of objections from Campaign for Houston and other Conservative voices point to nondiscrimination protections extending to gay and transgender residents which they believe would allow men into women's restrooms, and vice-versa.\nThe vote is scheduled for Nov. 3.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832543/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/73/41/8370252/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/73/41/8370254/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832531/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832534/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/73/41/8370255/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832541/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832541/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832539/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/76/64/7597348/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832539/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832532/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://myaccount.expressnews.com/dssSubscribe.aspx?pid=495&z=00000", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832531/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.chron.com/sports/texans/article/Texans-owner-Bob-McNair-rescinds-contribution-to-6586869.php", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/73/41/8370254/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832543/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832532/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/73/41/8370252/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.outsports.com/2015/10/21/9586112/gay-houston-texans-proposition-1-bob-mcnair-open-letter", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/76/64/7597348/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/73/41/8370255/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832534/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:35:42.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
