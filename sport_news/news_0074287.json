The biggest was $949,288. Some of the largest settlements went to women at state agencies and universities whose claims described harassment ranging from groping to sexual demands, the Republic found.\nThe Department of Corrections had the largest financial payouts among state agencies, with its $2.55 million accounting for nearly half the total sum paid by the state to settle workplace complaints.\nSecond highest? Arizona State University. The state paid $854,000 to settle nine lawsuits, including two with students who said they were propositioned by their professors.\nOther highlights from the Republic's analysis:\nNo rush to settle: It took nearly two years on average for the state to settle. The lingering cases sometimes cost taxpayers more because the state ended up picking up everyone's legal tab.\nWhen employees went to court, it often took years to resolve because the state often didn't settle until facing an adverse judgment in court.\nFew consequences: More than half the employees said they were penalized by retaliation, while those accused of discrimination went virtually unpunished.\nMore than one-third of those accused were actually promoted after their alleged actions, and more than 40 percent received pay raises following the settlements. Only one person was fired among the 57 settlement cases.\nWomen's claims: More than a third of the 57 settlements alleged gender or sex discrimination, or sexual harassment.\nThree-quarters of the settlements involved women, even though just more than half of the state workers are female.\nWomen received nine of the top 10 settlement payments.\n-- George Rede\ngrede@oregonian.com\n503-294-4004\n@georgerede", "external_links": ["http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/investigations/2015/10/14/public-disservice-asu-discrimination-harassment-settlements/73852816/", "http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/investigations/2015/10/14/public-disservice-women-collect-majority-state-discrimination-settlements-arizona/73852824/", "http://nocache.azcentral.com/ic/news/public-disservice/index.html", "http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/investigations/2015/10/14/public-disservice-corrections-largest-workplace-payouts/73852774/", "https://twitter.com/@georgerede", "http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/investigations/2015/10/06/arizona-discrimination-settlements-database/73234424/"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:53:31.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
