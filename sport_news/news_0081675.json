Judged from the numbers of those who attended it, the Conference was a regular mela. As many as 4,375 people, both men and women, had secured admission to it at a total cost to themselves in tickets of Rs. 38,000 odd which is a fair measure of the self-sacrifice which the Sikhs are making to advance the educational interests of their community. To this sum must be added the subscriptions paid on one form or another by the nearly a thousand persons inside the pandal, and the princely donations which poured in for the \"National Fund,\" which has already reached a lakh of rupees for the spread of primary education in the villages, and several other institutions of the community. The Sikh Educational Committee of the Chief Khalsa Diwan, which is running the Conference, is helping by means of grants-in-aid a net-work of private schools, both for boys and girls, including as many as 11 high schools to the extent of one-fifteenth of their total expenditure at a total cost of nearly Rs. 1,800 a month, orphanages, training classes for preachers and the like.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:16:21.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
