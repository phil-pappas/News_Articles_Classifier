Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 10:20 AM Updated at 10:22 AM Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 10:20 AM Updated at 10:22 AM BOILING SPRINGS – Gardner-Webb inducted five new members into its Athletics Hall of Fame over homecoming weekend in addition to presenting its meritorious service award to Ron Hooper. The official ceremony was held in Tucker Student Center Friday evening. The Hall of Fame 2015 class included: Terry Guess (football); John Keeter (football); Bill Nix (football, baseball); Linette Ramseur (volleyball) and Zach Ward (baseball). Terry Guess, football (1994-95 ): Guess re-wrote the GWU record books very quickly for kick returns. He earned All-America honors in 1994 after returning an NCAA Division II record six kicks – three punts and three kickoffs – for touchdowns. That record still stands 21 seasons later. Guess had three more touchdown returns called back in 1994, and led the nation with a 19.5 yards per return average on punts. A first-team All-South Atlantic Conference and All-Region pick as a return specialist in 1994, Guess was drafted in the fifth round the New Orleans Saints and became the first GWU draft pick to catch a touchdown pass in the NFL when he hauled in a 57-yard score vs. Atlanta on December 8, 1996 in the Super Dome. John Keeter, football ( 1958-19590: Standout lineman John Keeter made a name for himself in Boiling Springs on the football field for legendary head coach Norman Harris in the late 1950s. Keeter, who also played baseball for the Bulldogs, was a two-year starter at offensive guard on the gridiron and was highly decorated in his final season. Keeter earned junior college All-America honors in 1959 and was also named Gardner-Webb’s best lineman. The Bulldogs finished a solid 4-2-1 that season. Keeter joined the U.S. Army, where he was selected for the prestigious Old Guard Honor Guard Company in Arlington, Va. He also played football for Fort Belvoir during his tour of duty. Keeter finished his football career at Western Carolina, playing right guard for the Catamounts. He was named co-captain of the 1964 squad, which finished with a 6-4 record. Keeter went on to a successful career as a high school coach, directing programs at Newton-Conover, St. Stephens and Chase. He spent 24 seasons coaching football, track and wrestling – as well as serving as athletics director – at Chase and coached the only 10-0 regular season team in school history. He was twice named Conference Coach of the Year in football, and once in wrestling. Keeter was chosen to coach in the N.C. East/West All-Star Game in 1979. Bill Nix, football and baseball (1958-59): A versatile talent during the late 1950s at Gardner-Webb, Bill Nix was a busy man on the football field for legendary head coach Norman Harris. Nix played fullback on offense, kicked extra points and played safety on defense in 1958 and 1959. He was named junior college All-America as a sophomore 1959 and was a team co-captain for the Bulldogs during that 4-2-1 season. He also played for Coach Harris on the baseball squad as a freshman and sophomore. Following his time in Boiling Springs, Nix played fullback at the University of Richmond. Nix embarked on a successful career as an insurance adjuster and cemented a legacy of heroism with a selfless act on July 18, 1970. Nix swam into strong currents to save the life of an 11-year old swimmer at Sullivan’s Island, S.C., and gave his life in an attempt to save another young swimmer who had been carried out to sea. The 32-year old Nix was awarded a prestigious Carnegie Medal, given by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission to individuals for extraordinary acts of civilian heroism. Page 2 of 3 - LINETTE RAMSEUR, volleyball (1997-2001): Leading the charge for Gardner-Webb’s most dominant era in volleyball, Linette Ramseur set the bar very high during her four seasons on the court inside Paul Porter Arena. As a freshman in 1997 she helped the Runnin’ Bulldogs to a 31-7 overall mark and a 13-1 record in South Atlantic Conference play. Gardner-Webb’s regular season and tournament titles were the first in program history. Ramseur was sensational en route to SAC Freshman of the Year and All-SAC accolades, posting 370 kills, 40 aces, 352 digs and 23 blocks. As a sophomore she was named All-SAC once again, landing on the first team after compiling 490 kills, 584 digs, 51 aces and 43 blocks. Her crowning moment came as a junior in 1999 when she paced Gardner-Webb to an eye-popping 42-4 record that included a 16-0 South Atlantic Conference mark and a tournament title. Ramseur was named SAC Player of the Year and earned first-team All-SAC honors once again. Her numbers were astounding, with a career-high 650 kills, 584 digs, 36 blocks and 36 service aces – along with a strong .313 hitting percentage. Ramseur finished her four-year career at GWU with 115 wins and remains the program’s leader with 2,059 kills. She added 2,053 career digs and is the lone GWU student-athlete in the sport of volleyball to earn All-South Atlantic Conference honors three times. Zach Ward, baseball (2003-2005): In 2003, Gardner-Webb embarked on its first season in one of the toughest conferences in Division I baseball. Freshman pitcher Zach Ward made his presence felt quickly, earning national accolades after posting a win and a save in a series win at Georgia in February. Those accolades would continue, as Ward went on to earn Louisville Slugger Freshman All-America honors after that season and helped anchor a dominant pitching staff over the next three years. As a sophomore, Ward earned All-Atlantic Sun Conference honors after ranking No. 8 nationally with 106 strikeouts in just 79.2 innings and going 5-1 in A-Sun games with a 1.95 ERA. Ward starred in the famed Cape Cod League that summer, averaging 12.0 strikeouts per nine innings to go with a 1.05 ERA. He started the 2005 season with an astonishing streak, hurling 16.0 consecutive innings without allowing a hit. He fired a complete-game no hitter vs. Akron onFebruary 19, striking out 12 in that gem. He finished with seven wins in 2005, earned All-Atlantic Sun honors once again and fanned 127 batters. Ward was selected in the third round of the 2005 MLB Draft by Cincinnati and posted 22 wins and 341 strikeouts in four minor league seasons. He finished his Gardner-Webb career with 17 wins, a 3.58 ERA and 284 strikeouts in three seasons. Ward still ranks first in program history with 10.71 strikeouts per nine innings. RON HOOPER, basketball (2015 Meritorious service award): Former assistant basketball coach Ron Hooper served a vital role in several areas during his time with Gardner-Webb in the 1960s and 1970s, not only helping develop the Runnin’ Bulldogs into a national power on the court, but also building the Bulldog Club into a first-rate support group for the athletics program. Hooper was an assistant coach on teams that consistently posted 20 or more wins and churned out All-Americans and NBA talent during the most storied era in the program’s history. His involvement in the early years of the Bulldog Club were instrumental in that group’s assistance in providing athletic scholarships and a high level of community support for Gardner-Webb. The Runnin’ Bulldogs and their supporters embarked on trips all over the globe during that time, including trips to the Virgin Islands, Mexico City, Hawaii, Rome, London, Brazil, Scotland, Portugal, China and the Czech Republic. Hooper was also a driving force behind Gardner-Webb’s summer basketball camp, which regularly featured a staff comprised of pro and college luminaries – including Dean Smith, Larry Brown, Artis Gilmore, John Drew, George Karl, David Thompson, John Lucas and others.
