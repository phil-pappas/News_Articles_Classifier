Authorities said Miscevic had stabbed her husband once in the chest as he lay sleeping, and then she hit him with a bat when Zeljko, 56, tried to phone for help.\nShe was eventually found mentally unfit to stand trial. At an initial court appearance, prosecutors said she had been repeatedly hospitalized in the year before the stabbing for mental health issues.\nIn May, following a hearing, the judge found her not guilty by reason of insanity.\nThe court will receive periodic progress updates on her treatment, and Miscevic will be back in court next April for a status hearing. At some point, she could petition to be released from the mental health center, which would initiate a court hearing process.\nShe has been in custody since the stabbing and has been receiving treatment while in the DuPage County jail and at Elgin, where she was hospitalized after being declared unfit and later evaluated for treatment. Her mental health since the stabbing has \"dramatically improved,\" her attorney, Assistant Public Defender Steve Dalton, said Wednesday.\nAccording to the judge's order, Miscevic can be allowed unsupervised privileges at the mental health center and also can have supervised privileges off ground. Those recommendations can only come from the mental health center, Dalton said.\nThe Miscevics are the parents of a teenage son who is living with relatives in the Chicago area, according to court documents.\nClifford Ward is a freelance reporter.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Trials and Arbitration Mental Health Homicide Crime", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ec5a3/turbine/ct-lombard-miscevic-murder-insanity-met-1015-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:05:46.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
