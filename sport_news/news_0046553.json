Until it fell apart. (Photo: (Photo: The Indy Star )) \nThe NCAA has interviewed Ohio State guard JaQuan Lyle as part of its ongoing investigation into a new book claiming a former University of Louisville basketball staffer paid escorts thousands of dollars and gave them game tickets in exchange for sex with players and recruits, Yahoo Sports reported Wednesday. \nLyle, a one-time commitment to U of L, is mentioned in the book, titled \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" written by self-admitted escort Katina Powell, who claims Louisville's director of basketball operations Andre McGee paid her and several other escorts and dancers, including her own teenage daughters, as much as $10,000 for up to 22 parties with current and former U of L players and recruits. Powell, McGee face possible criminal probe \nDan Wallenberg, Ohio State's associate athletic director for communications, acknowledged the NCAA's meeting with Lyle, who is now a freshman at Ohio State. The NCAA has also reportedly met with Antonio Blakeney, a former Louisville commitment who is now a freshman at LSU. \n\"It does not affect us or JaQuan at all,\" Wallenberg told Yahoo. \"Weâ€™ve been told, and are pretty confident, this is not something we need to worry about.\" \nPowell's book also mentioned several other recruits, some of them, she claims, took part in the parties. \nA University of Connecticut spokesman declined commenting on an ongoing investigation this weekend when asked if the NCAA's investigators had asked to interview redshirt junior Rodney Purvis, who was a one-time Louisville pledge. He is mentioned early in Powell's book, but the author claims Purvis did not take part in the alleged activities.
