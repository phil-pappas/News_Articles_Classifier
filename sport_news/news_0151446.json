In his final four starts of the season, he finished 3-0 with an 0.62 ERA. He had 44 strikeouts in 29 innings. \nBraves rookie Ryan Weber (0-3) pitched very well on a damp and misty night, giving up five hits while striking out a career-high 10 in seven innings. \nRookie Felipe Rivero retired all six batters he faced in the eighth and ninth innings for his first save. It was the first save opportunity for the Nationals since closer Jonathan Papelbon was suspended for the final week of the season. \nLeading 1-0, the Nationals added two unearned runs in the eighth inning against three Braves relievers. The key play was an error by third baseman Adonis Garcia, whose throw on a potential inning-ending double-play sailed into right field and allowed Difo Wilmer to score. Bryce Harper then grounded into a fielder's choice to drive in Yunel Escobar. \nThe Braves' biggest threat against Strasburg came in the sixth inning when they had two runners on with one out. The right-hander struck out Nick Swisher and Jace Peterson to end the threat and end his season. \nRobinson's ninth home run of the season came with one out in the second inning. He drove a 3-2 pitch into the left-field stands. \nHarper, entered the game tied for first in the National League in batting average, was 1 for 4. He is 4 for 37 in his last nine games. \nThe Braves had won five consecutive home games. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nNationals: 3B Escobar was held out of the starting lineup with back spasms. He participated in batting practice and pinch hit in the seventh inning. He drew a walk and scored. \nBraves: C Christian Bethancourt left the game with an apparent left hand injury after striking out in the fifth inning. ... 3B Hector Olivera sat out with a sore left elbow that was hit by a pitch on Tuesday. Olivera played Wednesday, but the swelling returned. He is day-to-day. \nUP NEXT \nNationals: Gio Gonzalez (11-8, 3.93) will get the start as the Nationals open its final series of the year at the New York Mets. Gonzalez is 1-0 with a 0.77 ERA in two starts against the Mets this season. He will be opposed by Noah Syndergaard (9-7, 3.34). \nBraves: The Braves will host the NL Central champion St. Louis Cardinals for three games to close the season. Julio Teheran (10-8, 4.16) has a chance to hit the 200-inning mark for the second straight season. He has 194 2/3 in 32 starts. He will be opposed by Jamie Garcia (10-5, 2.36). \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:27:05.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
