By halftime, Floyd had accumulated nearly 100 yards rushing. \nWhen Frank Burton scored on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Penn quarterback DJ Johnson early in the second quarter, it appeared a rout was taking place. But to their credit, the ’Jackets continued to play well and eventually were able to move the ball on offense. \nNewark finally scored with less than two minutes left in the half to cut the Penn lead to 21-8. Quarterback Andrew DelPercio found Brendan Sherman behind the Colonials defense for a 54-yard scoring play. \n“We’re still not playing the game of football the way a coach wants the game to be played,” Newark coach Butch Simpson said. “We’re putting in all the hours of practice, but we’re not completely there. We still turn the ball over, but our effort was there and I felt we played hard, and I think maybe we surprised them a little in that we played that hard and hung in there.” \nPenn’s offense picked up the pace in the second half, scoring three more touchdowns, including an 85-yard kickoff return by senior Chi-Chi Amachi. \nOne of the bright spots for Newark was the improved play of the offense, specially the success of senior receiver Brendan Sherman. In addition to his first-half touchdown, Sherman also scored on a 76-yard pass from DelPercio in the third quarter. \n“All week long, my coaches have been telling me to step up and be more of a team leader, and I tried to bring that out, help my team and be the best player they want me to be,” Sherman said. “We fought hard tonight, and that’s what our coaches wanted us to do.” \nWilliam Penn improved to 6-0 on the season. The Colonials host Concord on Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m. \nNewark’s record fell to 2-4. The Yellowjackets will travel to The Charter School of Wilmington on Saturday with the opening kickoff set for 10:30 a.m. \n“So we are going to regroup and see if we can get a couple of weeks where we can get our pride back and hopefully we will continue to play hard and play better, and the rest will take care of itself,” Simpson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:58:46.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
