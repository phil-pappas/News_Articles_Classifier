Yet while Lappe, entering her sixth season as the leader of the CU women's basketball team, is grateful for Smith's predictable blue-collar approach, CU's coach also believes having the junior forward fill a bigger role at both ends of the floor will be a critical key for the Buffs in 2015-16. \n\"Haley is somebody who has to step up for us,\" Lappe said. \"She made huge strides from her freshman to sophomore season. We need her to make another jump this season. And she has to start it with her defense. Colorado junior forward Haley Smith increased her scoring average from 3.5 points as a freshman to 9.4 last year. ( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer ) \n\"We need her to lead on the defensive side of things. It's something that she has to really work on. It's not one of her biggest strengths. She's pretty solid at it, but we need her to be more of a defensive threat.\" \nSmith provided a steadying presence throughout her first two seasons with the Buffs, appearing in 66 of 68 games while increasing her scoring average from 3.5 points as a freshman to 9.4 last year. Yet with the loss of CU's No. 2 and 3 scorers, Jen Reese and Lexy Kresl, Smith's contributions will become more critical in 2015-16. \nLast year, Smith did most of her damage from the outside, shooting a solid .472 from the floor and putting together a sparkling .879 performance from the free throw line (51 for 58). This season, Lappe hopes to see Smith take a more versatile offensive approach. Advertisement \n\"From freshman year to sophomore year I worked a lot on my shot and extending my range, and I've continue to do that,\" Smith said. \"But now I'm working toward being able to get to the rim, being more explosive. If I'm being closely guarded on the outside, just being able to take what the defense gives me. That's definitely something that I'm working on this year.\" \nWith four freshmen expecting to be worked into the mix this season, Lappe reiterated Wednesday during CU's annual basketball media day that the Buffs' preseason focus has been to re-establish themselves as a dominant defensive program. Consistent scoring from Smith will be a necessity. As will improved defense. \n\"We have just unbelievable focus to get back to who we are as Colorado Buffaloes, and what we're about, and that's playing defense,\" Lappe said. \"That's being able to get up and down the floor. Playing together, playing really hard, and being able to re-energize our program. It's been a fun year to do that with so many young players, while at the same time having some great veterans.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:06:47.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
