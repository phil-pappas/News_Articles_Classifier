Charlotte drops to 2-5 and 0-4. \nThe five wins are more than the Golden Eagles’ win total from the previous three seasons combined. \n“It’s big now,” third-year Southern Miss head coach Todd Monken said. “When you get to five, you know what the next one is (bowl eligibility). That’s the standard around here, to be going to a bowl game. But all we’re focused on now is getting back, staying healthy and working on UTEP.” \nRichard, a senior Alexandria, Louisiana, native, rushed for more than 100 yards for the second consecutive game. It’s the first time a Golden Eagle running back has done that since Jamal Woodyard accomplished the feat in 2011. Richard also scored twice, once on a 95-yard kickoff return and a 7-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. \n“Just the grit and the grind the (offensive) line had today,” Richard said. “Early on, it didn’t seem like we would be too successful. They were shifting a lot up front. We were really getting stood up on a lot of run plays. But (offensive coordinator Chip) Lindsey did a good job of seeing what could work and we started implementing that.” \nThings started slowly for the Golden Eagles, as they managed 30 yards on eight plays and turned the ball over on downs on their first offensive possession of the game. Charlotte responded by marching 59 yards on 10 plays, connecting on a 25-yard field goal with 7:19 left in the first quarter to take a 3-0 lead. \nThree plays later, the tide turned. Following an Ito Smith run and an 8-yard catch by Casey Martin, quarterback Nick Mullens hit Mike Thomas with a dart on a short inside slant route. The senior receiver absorbed a shot from a Charlotte defensive back before pivoting and scampering into the end zone for a 69-yard touchdown. \nIt was the longest pass play of the season for Southern Miss, the longest catch of Thomas’ career and the fourth straight game the senior has caught at least one touchdown. \n“I just saw open field, saw touchdown, saw light and just ran to it full speed,” said Thomas, who extended his own school record with a fifth consecutive 100-plus yard game through the air. “I just try to do things to give a spark to the offense. I just try to execute and do my job. It’s a lot of chemistry right now on offense. Whenever I get an opportunity to make a play, I do whatever I’ve got to do to make it.” \nAfter tacking on a 38-yard field goal, extending the lead to 10-3 at the end of the first quarter, the Golden Eagles got a lucky break on their next score. On second-and-goal at the 49er 9-yard line, Mullens’ pass was intended for Casey Martin in the end zone. But it was batted into the air and into the waiting arms of sophomore tight end Taylor Marini. The touchdown was the first of Marini’s Southern Miss career. \n“(That) was awesome,” Mullens said. “The better you’re playing, the better luck you have, it feels like.” \nDefensively, Southern Miss allowed just 257 total yards to Charlotte’s offense, marking the third straight game the team has held its opponent to less than 300 yards of total offense. The 49ers entered play as the second-best rushing team in C-USA, led by Kalif Phillips who was the league’s top running back averaging 117.2 yards per game. \nBut the Golden Eagles held him to just 71 yards rushing on 17 carries. In addition, Southern Miss notched three interceptions – one each by Kalan Reed, Darian Yancey and Cornell Armstrong. \n“What we focus on defensively is just being as fast and as physical as we can,” said Yancey, whose pick was the first of the redshirt freshman defensive lineman’s career. “We just want to bring back the whole ‘Nasty Bunch’ and be one as a unit.” \nThomas led all receivers with 105 yards, while Richard was tops among all running backs with 114 yards on the ground. Mullens finished 24-of-38 for 265 yards and four touchdowns, one each to Thomas, Marini, Korey Robertson and Casey Martin. \nD'Nerius Antoine collected nine tackles to lead Southern Miss, while Xavier Thigpen put up 1 ½ sacks. \nSouthern Miss hosts UTEP at 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 31. 21 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1LUJyKf TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:00:59.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
