They are close to wrapping up their seventh straight Central Lakes Conference championship and have in their resume state Class A high school league titles in 2009 and 2011. \nThey are ranked third in Class A behind Visitation and Albert Lea in the latest coaches association poll and will be among the favorites at the state Class A true-team championships. \nThe Sabres compete at 4 p.m. Saturday at the University of Minnesota Aquatics Center in Minneapolis. \nThey took third last year and then were second in the high school league meet in November. True-team is run by the coaches association and measures a squad’s depth by counting all the finishes in every event. \nYou can’t win a true-team title with a few outstanding athletes. You have to have an overall strong team. \nThe Sabres learn where they stand Saturday. \nThe rest of the week: \nTuesday \n• St. Cloud Cathedral at Becker volleyball, 7 p.m. \nThese two went into the weekend tied with Albany for first place in the Granite Ridge Conference. All were 5-1. Cathedral goes into this one on a six-match winning streak, including four straight to win the Pierz Invitational. \nThursday \n• St. Cloud Apollo at Sartell football, 7 p.m. \nThese two have played some wildly entertaining games, including a 28-23 Sartell win in the playoffs last year when the Sabres’ Jake Lieberg fought off a double-team to catch the winning pass in the final seconds. But the most interesting fact? Apollo has never beaten Sartell. \n• Albany at Becker football, 7 p.m. \nTwo of the area’s best programs battle for an East Central District North Division title. (That doesn’t have the same ring to it as Granite Ridge Conference, does it?) Albany is No. 1 in the Class 3A QRF power ratings. Becker is ranked No. 1 in Class 4A by The Associated Press. \nFriday \n• Pierz at Holdingford football, 7 p.m. \nHoldingford is the defending Class 2A champion now bumped up to 3A. Pierz is certainly making a run for a 3A title this year. The Pioneers are tied for second in the state Associated Press poll and have been rolling over opponents. \nThis is the opinion of Times prep sports coordinator Tom Elliott.
