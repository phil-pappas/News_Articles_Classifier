So far no market checking teams have been constituted to act against the people who have allegedly created artificial scarcity of essential commodities. Jammu and Kashmir imports most of the pulses and food grains from outside the state and there are apprehensions that many traders are hoarding essential commodities to create scarcity in market and then use the opportunity to earn profit. Sources said there was bitterness among people against the role of administration, particularly the Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution (CAPD) Department for not taking action against the errant traders. “In Jammu, there is always a difference of Rs 10 to Rs 30 on a product as you move from one shop to another. In the past one month, price of pulses is changing every other day. There should be mechanism in place to check the fluctuating prices,” said Tarun Sharma of Talab Tillo, who works in private telecom company. Though black marketing and profiteering is a major challenge for the administration, there are no stringent laws to deal with the situation. Last year, the district administration had established a team to keep a check on markets. However, they were only mandated to impose fines on erring traders. No legal action was initiated against the offenders. Consumer rights groups have been crying hoarse over the situation, but so far the government has not done anything to control the rising prices, with people accusing officials concerned of ignoring their complaints. Minister for Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution Choudhary Zulfikar, however, said directions had been passed to the officials in every district to keep a check on the markets. “If people have any complaint, they can approach the Consumer Affairs Department. We are not silent against hoarders and action will be taken soon,” the minister said. Rising prices of vegetables and fruits in the city is also worrying consumers. The vegetable market here is probably the only market in the country which is not following the practice of putting rates upfront as a result those associated with the trade are earning two to three hundred per cent margin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:10:38.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
