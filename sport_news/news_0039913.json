He also caught a touchdown pass on offense.\n“We knew they had a couple really talented backs, but we thought we had an advantage if we could get physical with them. Once we got in their backfield, we caused all kinds of problems. We saved our best effort of the season for our biggest game.”\nOlentangy coach Mark Solis couldn’t find much fault with the performance. The Braves (7-1, 5-0), who entered second in their region, were a Division II state semifinalist a year\nago before moving up to Division I.\n“That’s how we’re capable of playing,” he said. “It’s been a tough road to this point, but we executed in all phases. Our defense played really well, Deeb (Haber) made some great plays, and we controlled the line of scrimmage.”\nHaber completed 12 of 21 passes for 239 yards and three touchdowns. Two went to Jake O’Donnell. Cam Kennedy rushed for 140 yards on 25 carries and two touchdowns. Olentangy scored on four of its first five series and led 24-0 at halftime.\nBut what was most impressive was Olentangy’s domination on defense. Defensive lineman Chris Crumb was the linchpin, not allowing Kilbourne any open space to unleash its speed-based running game.\n“There were some things we saw on film that we thought we’d be able to exploit,” Solis said. “We really took advantage of our physicality.”\nKilbourne coach Vince Trombetti agreed that his team was simply outmatched up front by Olentangy and its Division I prospects.\n“If you can’t stop the pressure they bring up front, it’s going to be a long night,” he said. “ Their defensive line is just so impressive. Crumb and some of those other guys are so hard to block.\n“They took away Isaiah (Young), and he’s a huge part of what we do. We can throw the ball, but we’re not exactly built to come from that far behind. We had a lot of blown assignments and way too many mistakes to beat a team of that caliber.”\nKilbourne (7-1, 4-1) came in ranked No. 1 in its Division II region. The only bright spot for the Wolves was a school-record 93-yard punt return for a touchdown by Josh Stoner.\nReynoldsburg 49, Lancaster 42, 3OT: Nathan Barko’s 1-yard touchdown run in the third overtime lifted Reynoldsburg (5-3, 3-2) to a win over visiting Lancaster (6-2, 3-2) in the OCC Ohio Division.\nBarko, who completed 20 of 29 passes for 279 yards, tied the score at 35 on a 16-yard pass to Jordan Hay with 2:08 left in regulation. After Lancaster quarterback Noah Dryden’s touchdown run in the second overtime, Barko hit Martee Morse for a 15-yard score to set up the third OT.\nMorse finished with seven catches for 157 yards and two TDs, including a 74-yard pass from running back Cameron Young.\nLancaster gained 614 total yards, all rushing, but lost a fumble, was intercepted on its only pass attempt and missed an 18-yard field-goal attempt at the end of the first overtime.\nShea Goss led the Golden Gales with 256 yards rushing and two touchdowns. Ryan Fitchpatrick added 161 yards and two TDs, and Dryden 108 yards and two TDs.\nsblackledge@dispatch.com\n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:45:56.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
