The story is almost too insane to believe. A basketball staff member used money from some unknown place to pay for escorts/sex workers/strippers for the recruits and players of that university and a book was being released about said incidents. It’s the kind of story that even in today’s world of absurd reality TV that seemed too extreme to be true. As UK fans, we had a difficult decision. On the one hand, our main rival is being scarred with an incredibly embarrassing scandal. That’s great and funny, right? But on the other hand the scandal is so disgusting and sad on all accounts, with child prostitution and other crimes, that it’s hard to laugh at this. I’ve seen fans land on both sides of that issue. Some are absolutely shaming themselves with how much joy they are taking. I take joy out of the struggle of the UL fan themselves, but some are getting joy about the story. That’s sad. But that’s life and the world we live in. Every fanbase in the country would have the same reaction if their rival had this happen to them as well. \nBut here is an angle I haven’t heard many mention. This scandal and what it likely will mean for UL and their recruiting abilities plus Pitino’s potential departure is NOT GOOD for Kentucky. Doesn’t it mean UL will certainly decline in prestige? Of course. Does it mean that UK will take an even greater grip on the rivalry? Of course it does. But having a weakened rival does not mean the rivalry is better. It means it is worse! I will never root for Louisville to win games or titles in any way. That’s not how a rivalry works. But at the same time, this rivalry between the 2 schools is the greatest in college basketball IMO because the 2 programs are so great. What annoys UL fans more than anything is despite the fact they are also on one of the greater runs in their school’s history, it gets dwarfed by the almost unbelievable run UK is currently on. The absolute definition of little brother. \nDo you remember the last 2 years of the Kragthorpe era? Do you remember the first couple years of the Rich Brooks era? Do you remember the end of the Denny Crum era or the Billy Gillispie era? When one program is so significantly worse than the other that damages the rivalry itself. The wins and losses will always go in cycles but the competitiveness of the rivalry is what makes it great. I don’t want my chief rival to stink and just crush them every single year. You get no joy out of that because the opposing fans don’t care. Duke and North Carolina became an elite basketball rivalry not just because they both are in the same state, but because they both were in the same state AND WERE GREAT PROGRAMS. \nThere is no avoiding it now. Louisville is going to be severely damaged for some time from this. And they should be. I don’t think they should sniff the NCAA Tournament for a couple years. Pitino likely needs to go. The team was already looking at a mediocre season before this happened and next year didn’t look much better. Now with this, who knows? But what I do know is when the likely conclusion comes and UL declines, that doesn’t make me happy in terms of the rivalry itself. I will miss my passionate rival down the road. They are getting what they deserve but we are getting a bad deal as well.

I haven’t liked one piece he has wrote yet. Mike Degrasse Tyson October 9, 2015 at 8:11   \nF*ck Louisville, and F*ck BTI. CatsBy80 October 9, 2015 at 8:17   \nBTI, I understand the gist of your post (see what I did there?)… However, the counter to your plea is simply that those of us UK fans living in Louisville have had to deal with those line-beard-having, crown-royal-sipping, flat-bill-wearing schmucks talk trash about the UK program and Calipari for the last 6 or 7 years. I sympathize with UofL fans ABSOLUTELY 0%. I hope the program gets burned to the ground… Something else to consider is that the rivalry has been enhanced tenfold with the 2 respective coaches at each program. When Pitino leaves, do you seriously think it won’t take a minor step backwards? pooman October 9, 2015 at 8:18   \ni couldnt agree more rondo. i want ul to stay in the toilet bowl where they belong. that way i dont have to hear them run their cum catchers Echo1 October 9, 2015 at 8:20   \nI really don’t see this angle. I do not UL and most of the fan base. I hope UK crushes them by 75 every year. Rivalry? No. Crush them every year. It’s not our job to hope they keep up with us and beat us once in a while. KT October 9, 2015 at 8:23   \nBTI In no way should UK fans not be able to continue enjoying this. Its particularly vindicative with the crap they’ve taken the last few years from that rivalry. Another thing, with the way that program is being ran by snakes like Jurich I don’t really care if they get the death penalty at this point. Might be the best thing to happen for the state and the school long term. Rajonrondo9 October 9, 2015 at 8:24   \nHow’s it a rivalry right now anyways? They have beat us once since Calipari has been there. Shelby October 9, 2015 at 8:28   \nYeah, bob-the-pitino-lover valvano took this angle on his show yesrerday saying that anyone who took joy from this is a sick SOB; well, i’m one sick SOB then cause i ain’t stopped smiling since the story broke. I don’t condone child prostitution, but the fact that it’s the Tards just tickles me pink. Tom Jurich kept ricky after his last attrocity and then followed that up with hiring bobby p back–win at all cost tom, win at all cost. You reap what you sow. Valvano’s rhetoric would be completely different if the shoe were on the other foot. ukjaybrat October 9, 2015 at 8:53 am | Permalink \nThat’s all Louisville fans have. misdirection. Clearly we are giddy that after all of their “cal’s a cheater, he’s going to get caught someday” crap, it was THEM that finally got caught with their hand in the cookie jar. We are giddy that their fans are getting what they deserve. but all BV wants to do is misconstrue everything “oh you are sick, how can you be happy about child prostitution.” it’d be funny if it wasn’t so sad. Mathlete October 9, 2015 at 8:29   \nI maintain that, like the Hoosiers, we should feel sorry for the Cardinals. They’ve been so deluded about how great their programs are (when their success has actually been both recent and short-lived), and now they’re being dragged down by their own foolishness (Louisville’s is apparent, Indiana’s is named Tom Crean). Matted October 9, 2015 at 8:31   \nI always like btis posts. He is a self-described UK fan that’s not a UK nut. I don’t necessarily agree with his position, but being devils advocate on a site like this is necessary. Kudos to ksr. Cat Fan 85 October 9, 2015 at 8:31   \nWe’ll find another rival, just like we did after the decline of IU and (Tennessee) after our very own decline in football. Everything good about the UofL program has been made on the back of UK. We never should have started playing them annually and the legislature should stick to governing the people and not deciding athletic schedules. They’d still be a back water second tier program with a couple of titles from the 80’s if not for the recognition they’ve received from the media driven cross state rivalry that never should have existed to begin with. BTI needs to go. October 9, 2015 at 8:32   \nDwarfed is a strong word. 1-1 in titles. \nLouisville has over achieved or lived up to expectations most years. Each of the past three seasons UK has significantly underachieved. \n2013 NIT with the number one class and a bunch of first rounders \n2014- number one class again and they struggle all year with fans turning on Cal only To come up short at the end of a lucky run. \n2015- “best team ever” gets out hustled and out coached by a bunch of big 10 white dudes. \nDon’t even get me started on football. That’s why you are 4-1 right now and no one has you predicted to be in a decent bowl because they know that you will choke the season away just like Every other year! Have fun basking in the misery of others, you all seem very good at that. \nfor a group that doesn’t care about little brother, you just admitted that this whole website has mainly focused on said little brother for a week now. Can’t you just enjoy what your program is good at? Oh yeah, that is only basketball and that’s only 5 months per year. One Eyed Snake October 9, 2015 at 8:42 am | Permalink \nTard……..

I want Louisville to lose every game in every sport. Their fans have embraced the win at any cost attitude and have adopted an heir of superiority to other programs and it all came at the cost of guns, drugs, hookers, and thugs. not to mention their scandalous coaches. All the while, ignoring these facts and blasting Calipari for what they *believe* happened (but of course have no proof of nor was he ever implicated in anything)… their fans deserve everything their program gets right now and i for one have no lost love for them. Monte October 9, 2015 at 8:46   \nSo tired of many of the stories on this subject referring to Andre McGee as a basketball staffer. He was the DIRECTOR of Basketball Operations at the “University” of Louisville. Jay October 9, 2015 at 8:47   \nGood points. In reality I’d say they were never our rival. How many times have they beated in 5 years? 10? Louisville isn’t our rival: Duke is. Sherlock Holmes needs Moriarty, not some pathetic criminal he can beat every time. I don’t understand the root of this Louisville rivalry, and I’ve lived in the bluegrass my whole life. Other than the fact that Louisville talks trash and we talk trash, etc. Some people act like its a blood feud. In reality its theater and entertainment. Kind of worrisome. CATandMONKEY October 9, 2015 at 9:02 am | Permalink \nThe problem with Duke as a rivalry (and I may despise them more than the cards) is that we play them infrequently. We are rivals simply by virtue of both teams owning historically great records, having great players and because of one game in 92 and the vengence-filled comeback win in 1998. Remove either of those games (regardless of outcome) and one could not even call UK-Duke a rivalry. The Original WTF Guy October 9, 2015 at 8:48   \nNick Saban has stated that his goal as a coach is to so completely crush a team that someday one will not come out to play the second half. That should be UK’s goal vs UK. We should beat them so bad and so often that someday they simply fold up their tents and go home. Even better, slink across the river and set up camp in southern Indiana where they belong. Why would anyone possibly care about how “close” the rivalry is? \nBTW, you guys know there really is not a person called “BTI”, right? It is really a computer program that has been designed to write the dumbest posts possible, designed to stir the pot as much as possible. There is no way a person could be that bad and that wrong for so long. BTIis aDOUCHE October 9, 2015 at 8:57 am | Permalink \nBTI is only on here to be a troll and stir BBN into a shitfit… I would hate to see his comments on other sites kentuckyjoe October 9, 2015 at 8:54   \nGood thinking BTI. The only way there is a rivalry is if both teams are good and both teams have a chance to win. And both teams do win every so often. So, if we want a rivalry we should hope that Louisville, and RP, come thru this with as little culpability and punishment as possible. That’s what I hope for. CATandMONKEY October 9, 2015 at 8:55   \nFirstly, BTI still sucks. That being out of the way ,I feel no remorse for wishing suffering on the UofL fanbase. With regards to the rivalry I would much rather beat a 12-2 UofL team by 20+ every year than to beat a .500 club in December. Much more fun to put the overconfident filthy pigeons in their place annually than it is to whoop-up on a team that has even lost the delusional support of their ignorant fans. \nA rivalry need two teams that are at least competitive. Do any of us really think Florida considers us a rival in football? Seriously, they don’t. The good news is that despite our record vs the Gators, we have scared the heck out of their fans two years running and we could actually turn it into a rivalry by winning a few. \nI want to see Louisville fans suffer and cower in a corner, then cry for weeks after we beat them 85-55 each year but it is far more satisying to crush them when they at least are under the illusion that they have a chance. BobKYCats October 9, 2015 at 8:56   \nI’m not ashamed to say I’ve been laughing gleefully to myself ever since this story broke. Squirming Card fans are the best Card fans. Wbkuecat44 October 9, 2015 at 9:00   \nLittle brother is still a brother and thus family I hope they get over scandal quickly. BTI is right. The rivalry and the state is better with 2 consistently top rated teams RICK October 9, 2015 at 9:04   \nBryan, You would make a good card fan and i hope they get nailed. This is good for the rivalry , we get to give them hell and i love it. Stop trying to make us get along with each other it’s no fun. Don October 9, 2015 at 9:05   \nIf this was a “filler” post, or if it was meant to have substance, it failed either way. Clam October 9, 2015 at 9:11   \nI see your logic, but I don’t care. UK can be a national power while UofL struggles. For example, our annual schedule would be more sexy if it included a strong IU rivalry game. However, not playing a sucky IU each year doesn’t keep UK from being in the national championship mix. I want UofL to be bombed to the stone age by this scandal, and I don’t care if it means our annual rivalry game is a little less fun. UK will still be just as good, and UofL certainly won’t. Sounds good to me. BlueRedneck October 9, 2015 at 9:12   \nI would be lying if I said that I didn’t get a few good laughs out of this whole scandal. As sad as it is in some respects, the fact that Louisville’s head basketball coach has had multiple sex scandals swirling around him, while meanwhile Jurich hires a football coach who has had his own well-publicized escapades, is good comedy. However, I live in Louisville, and as overbearing as some of their fans can be, I also know quite a few UofL fans who are good folks. We have some fans of our own that embarrass the rest of the fan base. I’m OK with UofL having some success, just as long as we are better! Honestly, I would rather see something like this happen to a holier-than-thou program like Duke, since they seem to constantly skate by seemingly immune from any kind of sanctions in spite of multiple incidents over the past ten years. Same for UNC. facts October 9, 2015 at 9:13   \nUKJAYBRAT-One question,you said,”scandalous coaches”.
