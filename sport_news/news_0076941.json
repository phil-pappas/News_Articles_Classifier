While the warm and dry weather has been ideal for many area farmers during harvest, it's been taking toll on dry conditions in KELOLAND. \nWestern and central KELOLAND are not too bad, but Rapid City and Pierre range from a quarter to a half inch below. Eastern and southeast KELOLAND have been the driest. This is where amounts are close to an inch and a half below average in Sioux Falls to nearly an inch and a quarter in Aberdeen and Watertown. \nNortheast KELOLAND is the area where the drought monitor is making a comeback. It covers an area from near Mobridge to Watertown and northeast. \nWe should put a dent in some of the dry conditions later this week as rain is likely Thursday into Friday. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
