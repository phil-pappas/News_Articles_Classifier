NASCAR said earlier in the week it would make just one attempt to finish the race under green-flag conditions, and Logano was the leader on what was supposed to be the final restart. But a spin in traffic behind him before he took the green extended the caution and set up one more chance for Dale Earnhardt Jr. and others. Instead, reigning Sprint Cup champion Kevin Harvick sputtered on the restart to trigger a multi-car accident. Logano did pass under the green flag, though, and NASCAR quickly threw the caution. It denied Earnhardt a chance to race for the win, and he was eliminated from the Chase for the Cup playoffs. So was Denny Hamlin, who used Twitter to call the end of the race \"complete crap\" and apologize to anyone who \"spent money coming to this circus.\" Matt Kenseth and Ryan Newman also were eliminated from the Chase.
