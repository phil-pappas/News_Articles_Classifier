Using a narcotics-sniffing dog, the dog alerted to an odor in the driver side's floorboard, near the hood release latch, Manzella wrote in an affidavit.\nPolice located 23 wrapped bundles of cash totaling $204,735 in hidden compartments near the front driver's side wheel well area, the affidavit said.\nOne kilogram of cocaine was recovered from a driver's side hidden compartment, according to police.\nPadilla told police she lives in Los Angeles and has no ties to Portland. She told police that she didn't know the drugs or cash were hidden inside the van.\nCircuit Court Judge David F. Rees increased Padilla's bail Wednesday after police argued that they feared Padilla would be a flight risk, considering her access to a large amount of cash.\nPadilla is being held on allegations of unlawful delivery of cocaine, possession of cocaine and money laundering.\nShe's being held at the Multnomah County Inverness Jail. Her next court date is Oct. 22.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:26:33.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
