It took 15 minutes to fix it.” \nThe cock-eyed goal post stood a symbol of Spain Park’s victory , sparking online debate and plenty of photo shares, but Urban said it was the work of a single Spain Park fan. \nPolice initially detained the student on the field, but Urban said he talked to the student and defused the situation. \n“He jumped up there and wanted to be cool,” said Urban, who witnessed it while on the field after the game. “He looked up like, ‘Oh my God, what have I done?’… I told the kid, ‘I get it. You’re excited. You’re a high school kid.’” \nThe goal posts at the Hoover Met are temporary and installed only during football season, then stored during the rest of the year. Urban said it’s designed to come apart for storage, which is what led to it falling to one side. He said the goal posts are the not the state-of-the-art collapsible kind that are often seen at major college football stadiums. \nHoover players and coaches left the field quickly after shaking hands and hearing the band played its alma mater. Urban said that was done as a way to avoid any confrontation and allow Spain Park to celebrate. \nUrban said law enforcement and other security personnel asked Spain Park fans to remain in or near their stands along the third-base line at the Hoover Met, and everyone complied. \n“Their kids were phenomenal,” Urban said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:01:01.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
