The city just northeast of Nashville often sent teams from Montgomery County back to Clarksville with what was left of a dejected soccer season. \nBut for the past four years, that has changed. \nClarksville High (18-4) had to weather a physical game and a few injuries along the way, but it managed to survive a tough Hendersonville team to capture a 2-1 victory Wednesday night's Region 5-AAA soccer tournament championship. It's the Lady Wildcats' fourth straight region title. \n\"We're 3-1 on this field,\" Clarksville coach Jeff Jordan said. \"We like coming here. But I have to say that Hendersonville was ready for us. They were ready. They seemed fresh and we did not. I think we were tired and maybe Hendersonville's 5-3 win against Henry County allowed some of their players a rest because they seemed much more energetic than we were.\" Buy Photo \nClarksville High's Gybson Roth (1) tries the kick the ball out of Hendersonville's attacking third during their region soccer championship game Wednesday night.

But once the game began, Hendersonville controlled much of it, as Clarksville held a more defensive posture in midway through the second half after Salera Jordan's goal gave CHS a 2-0 lead. \nThe Lady Commandos began pressuring Clarksville's midfielders, and they finally broke through with Brooke Long's goal with 20:54 left. Long was able to tap in the ball just before colliding with CHS goalie Melia Correa. Correa stayed on the ground for several minutes before needing assistance off the field. Her right leg was placed in a brace after suffering a knee injury. \nJordan turned to senior Kelsey Greiff, who played the remaining 20 minutes of the game in goal. \n\"You have to give credit to coach Jordan and Clarksville,\" Hendersonville coach Russ Plummer said. \"They've had our number the past four years in region. Coach does a great job with them. They were banged up and had to go to their backup keeper, and they still did what they had to do to win.\" \nHendersonville had several opportunities in the final 20 minutes to equalize the score. Twice Greiff had to come out of the goalie box to snatch the ball away and once bobbled a ball that left the entire team scrambling to defend the goal. \n\"We have another keeper, but she's a freshman and to throw her out there in a region championship game without that kind of experience just didn't seem fair to me,\" Jordan said \"Kelsey is athletic and is a great player and smart as well. She did a great job for us.\" \nBefore Correa left the game, she did manage to save at least two sure-fire Lady Commando goals. The first was late in the first half in a scoreless game. Correa had to dive to her right to punch the ball away as it hit the far post and skipped out of bounds. Less than a minute later, Gybson Roth found herself with the ball and a Hendersonville defender on her heels. Roth managed to shake off the defender and beat Lady Commandos goalie Makensie Carter for a goal and a 1-0 lead. \nAt the 62-minute mark of the second half, Hendersonville nearly scored a goal, but Long's shot rolled wide left of the net. Correa then came up with a leaping save that she knocked over the goal with 38 minutes left. \nJordan's goal came with 34:15 left after she received a perfect pass from Roth. Jordan outran her defender to the ball as Carter came off her line to meet her. Jordan slipped the ball past Carter and drilled it into an open net for a 2-0 lead. \n\"I was trying to get energy out of our girls,\" Jordan said. \"Our depth is so shallow right now, and that became evident with a few injuries. We actually played Gybson in the back and strategically moved her up for like a minute and she scored her goal.\" \nHendersonville outshot Clarksville 15-9 but it was the two opportunities that CHS had that it made count. \nNow the defending Class 3A state champs will play host to the loser of Thursday's Region 6 title game between Brentwood and Independence in Saturday's 3A sectional game. \nReach Prep writer George Robinson at 931-245-0747 and on Twitter @Cville_Sports.
