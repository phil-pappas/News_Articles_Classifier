Give them Pittsburgh. Give them the Green Bay Packers, the Cincinnati Bengals, or another run at the Seattle Seahawks.\nIt doesn’t really seem like much should slow the Patriots down on the road to the Super Bowl.\nThey’ve all but won the AFC East already, particularly considering the coaching prowesses of Rex Ryan and Joe Philbin— whom the Miami Dolphins fired on Monday —on Sunday, each of whom performed his job with the strategic thinking of an empty soda can while Patriots coach Bill Belichick was enjoying his bye week. That’s not to sleep on the 3-1 New York Jets by any stretch, but let’s see what Todd Bowles’ team can do in Foxborough in a few weeks before anyone considers them a viable threat in the division.\nAs for the rest of the AFC, the Cincinnati Bengals remained undefeated with an impressive win over the Kansas City Chiefs, but we’re finding out more and more on a weekly basis now that the Chiefs kinda suck.\nDenver? Peyton Manning looked like he was facing a Belichick defensive scheme as the Minnesota Vikings, who picked the Denver Broncos’ quarterback off twice, nearly left Mile High with an upset victory.\nThe San Diego Chargers snuck past the lowly Cleveland Browns. The Baltimore Ravens won in desperation against the Pittsburgh Steelers Thursday night for their first win of the season. The 2-2 Oakland Raiders are sort of a cute, early-season storyline to take note of before they inevitably fade away.\nThen there are the Indianapolis Colts. Insert your own punch line.\nThe Colts got their second win of the season Sunday, but it was without starting quarterback Andrew Luck, who missed the game with an injured shoulder, and it was by the slightest of margins, 16-13, over the same hapless Jacksonville Jaguars who the Patriots trounced to the tune of 51-17 last weekend. Style points aside, the Colts have only scored 72 points so far this season through four games, placing Indy’s offense in the lower rungs of the NFL.\nNo matter how you want to dress up the Colts’ win over Jacksonville (will they be raising a banner commemorating the victory later this week?), led by 40-year-old backup Matt Hasselbeck, this season was already beginning to look ugly before Luck went down.\nSo it’s somewhat disappointing that here we sit, only 13 days from the Sunday night showdown at Lucas Oil Stadium between the Patriots and Colts, with coach Chuck Pagano’s (who is morphing into Pete Carroll, circa 1997, with every rah-rah speech after each unimpressive victory) team in shambles. The Colts, of course, were the preseason darlings of a number of prognosticators (many with a Bristol, Conn. address), only to start somewhat flat. After an offseason of Colts media and fans pea-cocking for their roles in Deflategate, that mid-October showdown was supposed to be pigskin Armageddon, a battle between the two AFC favorites vying for the conference crown.\nInstead, it’s shaping up to be just be another rout by New England. Who’s going to pound 200 rushing yards against the Colts this time around? Does it matter?\nThe Patriots have 13 games remaining on their 2015 schedule, and the remaining opponents are a combined 21-22. While I’m not subscribing to the notion that Patriots are going 19-0, believing instead that the team will trip up somewhere along the way, the evidence is starting to suggest I may be an idiot.\nAs it stands now, the Broncos and the Jets are the only teams on the schedule, as currently constituted, with winning records. The decimated Dallas Cowboys are up next at 2-2.\n“They’re a good football team,” Belichick said of the Cowboys during a conference call on Sunday. “I know they’ve lost a couple key players, but they’ll be getting some more guys back next week, and they’ve got a lot of players to work with. It’s going to be a big challenge for us.”\nTranslation: “Next.”\nThe Colts travel to Houston Thursday night to try to amass three wins heading into their game with New England, a rematch of last January’s AFC title game.\nThe AFC South (five wins among four teams in the entire division) is terrible, so the Colts won’t be going away entirely. With the Tennessee Titans, Texans, and Jaguars sitting behind doors No. 2-4, it would take an even bigger collapse for Indianapolis to not sit atop the division once the regular season ends.\nBut they proved yet again on Sunday that they’re nowhere near ready to take on the New England Patriots in less than two weeks.\nLet’s face it though. Nobody is.\nWhere the Patriots called home before Gillette\nPrevious -- of -- Next The Foxborough Bay State Raceway was the proposed site of a new Patriots stadium in 1970.
