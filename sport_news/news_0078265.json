But this has not been forthcoming. Nevertheless, Pakistan stands ready to engage in a dialogue on all outstanding issues.\"\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:39:32.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
