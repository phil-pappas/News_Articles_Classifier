(Source: WCVB/CNN) \n(CNN) - Coca-Cola and Kellogg's aren't happy with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. The football star criticized their products in a Boston sports radio interview on Monday. \nBrady called Coke \"poison for kids,\" and questioned whether frosted flakes was actually food. \nHe was responding to criticism of a friend and business partner, Alex Guerrero. A recent magazine profile claimed Guerrero lied about being a doctor, and falsely claimed his nutritional supplements cured cancer. \nCoca-Cola and Kellogg's hit back in statements released on Tuesday. Coca-Cola said its products are safe and could be part of a balanced lifestyle. \nKellogg's pointed to multiple studies linking cereal with good health. \nCopyright 2015 CNN. All rights reserved.
