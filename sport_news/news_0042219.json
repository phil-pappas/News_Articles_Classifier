(Photo: Andrew Weber / USA Today Sports) 9 CONNECT 10 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMarcus Mariota is the second player in NFL history to throw eight touchdowns in his first three career games, joining two-time Super Bowl champion Mark Rypien. \nHe’s produced the second-highest passer rating of any player in his first three starts, trailing only Greg Cook, the United Press International AFL Rookie of the Year in 1969. \nAnd in his most recent appearance, before the Titans ’ Week 4 bye, the rookie quarterback was seen leading an 80-yard touchdown drive in the final minutes of play against the defending AFC South champion Colts, which would have tied the game had the team succeeded in its attempt to rush for a two-point conversion. \nTo which, Bills coach Rex Ryan has replied with a shrug. \n“I don’t think the kid will have his way against us,” Ryan told Buffalo media during a news conference Wednesday. “I don’t think that’s going to happen.” Marcus Mariota doesn't want to make a habit of losing \nThe Titans (1-2) play the Bills (2-2) on Sunday in their second of four consecutive games at Nissan Stadium, eager to break a two-game losing streak that aggravated them into the off week. They’re also motivated to end a six-game skid at home that’s stretched for nearly a year, since a 16-14 victory against the Jaguars on Oct. 12, 2014. \nBut this is a different team than the group that staggered to a 2-14 finish last season, one experiencing far more success on the ground, through the air and on the scoreboard. \nThe Titans have reached at least 35 points twice in three contests after never scoring more than four touchdowns in a game last season. \nMariota is a big reason why. \nRyan was a bit more complimentary about the Heisman Trophy winner and second overall draft pick during a conference call with Tennessee media later in the day. 5 questions for Titans against Bills \n“He’s a real talent, a dual threat, a guy who can run and obviously pass,” Ryan said. “He’s got a big, strong arm and seems to have a lot of poise, too, so obviously there’s a reason why he was taken where he was taken. \n“He’s obviously got a real good grasp of the system,” he said. “He’s a multitalented guy, and they’re taking advantage of some of that. He does some of those zone reads where they incorporate a pass/run option, different things. The young man looks impressive.” \nHistoric passing stats aside, Mariota has yet to prove a threat running the ball, despite his success on the ground in college. \nMariota ran for more than 700 yards in each of his three seasons as the starting quarterback at Oregon. In his final season, he rushed for a career-high 770 yards and 15 touchdowns on 135 carries. \nThrough three games in the NFL, he’s rushed five times for 25 yards. \nTitans coach Ken Whisenhunt and Mariota have both spoken about potentially running when opportunities present themselves. \nBills quarterback Tyrod Taylor, also successful running the ball in college, has rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries this season. \nBut Ryan doesn’t see the Titans straying from their current tactics. \n“You have to be prepared for it, but I don’t think anybody really wants your quarterback running that much,” he said. “Our guy is the fastest quarterback in the league. We face it. But you don’t necessarily want to send those guys as an every-down runner. And they’re not doing that. But (Mariota) does have that threat, and obviously he can scramble for first downs as well.” \nReach Jason Wolf at 615-259-8220 and follow him on Twitter at @JasonWolf and Instagram at TitansBeat. \nVideo: Best of J-Mac Show Episode 3 with guest Dorial Green-Beckham BEST OF THE J-MAC SHOW EPISODE 3 Why does Titans' McCourty watch opponents' game footage? | 02:09 Ep. 3: Titans' defensive back Jason McCourty on watching opponents' games on TV and what he picks up from it.
