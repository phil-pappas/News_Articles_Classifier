Silverado initially was supposed to be a temporary host site until the event could return to Morgan Hill and be played at magnate John Fry's ultra-private course, The Institute. \nComplications in building a large, castle-replica clubhouse at The Institute ultimately derailed that plan, however. The tournament was played at nearby CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin from 2010 to 2013 with that goal in mind, but when delays persisted, the event was played at Silverado last year and this year. \nThere was an option to return to the Napa course again in 2016 under the Frys.com sponsorship, but Kolder said the company is \"re-strategizing\" its future as it pertains to professional golf. \n\"As soon as our elaborate clubhouse is finally built, we hope to announce an even more spectacular event,\" Kolder said.

In 2012, it became the leadoff event in the Tour's revamped wrap-around season starting in the fall. In recent years, the event has been able to attract some of the top names in golf, including Tiger Woods, Ernie Els and Rory McIlroy, who played the event this year. Woods was supposed to play this year but scratched due to back surgery. \nSilverado, meanwhile, has long wished to regain a permanent PGA Tour event, having hosted one from 1968 through 1980 under two different sponsors, Kaiser and Anheuser-Busch. The tournament moved to Virginia in 1981. PGA Champions Tour events (seniors) were staged at Silverado from 1989 to 2002.
