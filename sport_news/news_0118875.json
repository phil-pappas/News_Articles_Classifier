New Angus CEO R. Douglas Cooper says that New Angus is testing equipment and hiring workers. Formerly called Northern Beef Packers, the plant filed for bankruptcy because it lacked money to buy cattle for slaughter. Cooper says he doesn't expect the plant to hit full capacity this year. New Angus products are set to be labeled as packed by DemKota Ranch Beef, but the plant name isn't changing. Cooper says the plant will begin with \"just a small handful of cattle to test the systems and train.\" The plant had been at the center of an investigation into financial misconduct at the Governor's Office of Economic Development.
