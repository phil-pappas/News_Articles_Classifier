As the Tigers prepare to compete with a tough Boston College defense, though, he's feeling confident about his teammates on both sides of the ball. \nScott believes Clemson has the best defense in the country, and that claim will be tested during Saturday's homecoming game against the number one ranked D in the country. In 2014, Clemson barely made it out of Chestnut Hill with a win. However, the Clemson defense stepped up on a late fourth down play and the team took the O'Rourkeâ€“McFadden Trophy home. \n\"We just didn't execute. That's all it was,\" Scott said of last year's game. \"We just didn't execute the things we knew we could do.\" \nHe expects the team to keep the trophy in South Carolina this weekend if they can make they plays he knows they're capable of. \n\"We're going to take what the defense gives us. If it's more running or if it's more passing, that's what it's going to be. We just want to win at the end of the day.\" \nClemson players have even more determination to win after a week full of talk about \"Clemsoning.\" Scott has turned Dabo Swinney Dabo Swinney Head Coach View Full Profile 's rant about the term following the Georgia Tech game into motivation to keep winning. There's no apparent reason the public is so eager to see an ugly Clemson loss, so Scott thinks the public needed to hear Swinney's words. \n\"It gets me hyped the way he can be with us and has our back through everything,\" Scott said. Fellow players echoed similar sentiments, and it's clear that Swinney's coaching style has created a special atmosphere for his players. \n\"To be honest, he [Swinney] does what he does, man. Even with the dancing, you don't see coaches do that. You can go in their locker room and they're happy, but you don't see their coach go out there and dance with the team like that. I think it's just special. No other team has it like us.\" \nThat positive environment has lead players like Scott to concentrate on improving their own personal game. Scott uses the off season to work on his speed and toughness, and he's figured out how to use his smaller size as an advantage. \n\"You can look at me and think, 'oh he's 5'10\", I don't think he could take those type of hits, blah blah blah'\" I know how I am, and as a person I'm just determined.\" \nScott has taken young players Deon Cain Deon Cain", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:28:49.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
