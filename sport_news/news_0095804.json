FIFA is facing unprecedented pressure to clean up its act following numerous scandals this year -- and this symposium could be the start of changes within the organization. \nThe meeting is taking place within this hotel. No details were given as to how FIFA will be overhauled -- but Francois Carrard, the committee's chairman, says he will present concrete recommendations to FIFA on Tuesday -- and that progress is \"on track.\" Earlier reports claimed some reforms would impose 12-year term limits for elected FIFA officials, and more detailed integrity checks on committee members. The crisis at the organization escalated this month when both FIFA President Sepp Blatter and UEFA leader Michel Platini, were banned 90 days by FIFA's Ethics Committee, pending a full investigation. \nTuesday's FIFA meeting will discuss those suspensions, and the governing body will hold an Extraordinary Congress in Zurich in February, when its 209 member associations will elect a new President and vote on reforms.
