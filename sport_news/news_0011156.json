(Nick Kruf/The Journal-World via AP) By Ben Felderstein The Capital-Journal \nLAWRENCE — Kansas coach David Beaty has often said one thing that is important to him is a strong and efficient special teams unit. \nHowever, in Saturday’s 30-20 loss to Texas Tech, it was the special teams that cost Kansas a chance at its first win. Three missed field goals and a missed extra point left 10 points on the board that could have tied it. \nJunior Matthew Wyman stepped up for a kick with 12:59 to go in the first quarter, looking to knock in a 52-yard field goal. Beaty had been raving about Wyman’s power all season, saying he has hit from 60 many times in practice. \n“I got under it,” Wyman said of his miss which was short. “I didn’t hit it clean. I didn’t have a solid day on field goals.” \nWyman said he felt somewhat responsible for KU’s loss, having missed seven possible points. A quarter later, sophomore Nick Bartolotta stepped up for a 22-yard attempt, seemingly a gimmie for KU’s short place kicker. \nBartolotta pushed the kick wide right, forcing KU off the field empty-handed after an 11-play, 56-yard drive. A few minutes later, KU was driving the red zone again and were in position to kick a 34-yard field goal with six seconds left in the half. But once again, Wyman missed. \nFollowing KU’s first scoring drive midway through the third quarter, Wyman came on to take the extra point because of Bartolotta’s earlier miss. Wyman too pushed the attempt wide, giving KU three missed field goals. \n“It’s a situation where it’s absolutely, unbelievably disappointing for our coaches, our players,” Beaty said of his team’s kicking woes. “There was a technique flaw, and you know what, we don’t get to whine and complain.” \nBeaty said all there is left to do is to figure out what went wrong and and why the team was unable to convert in these situations. KU saw its most impressive performance of the season slip away because it could not convert on its kicks. \nSophomore Darious Crawley said it hurts to have a drive end that way, adding it feels like that all that work amounted to nothing. Whether a missed kick is the way it happens or there is a turnover by the offense, Crawley said it feels the same. \n“All those kids that were involved, man, those guys wanted to make those things just as much as anybody else,” Beaty said. \nWhile Wyman struggled with the field goal unit, he excelled in his career debut as a punter. After a 23-yard punt from senior Eric Kahn, Wyman entered the game and averaged 42.3 yards on three attempts. \n“I punted, like, three times in high school,” Wyman said. “Two out of three special teams were good ... was pretty good on kickoffs and punts.” \nThe placekicker had only taken two live punt reps in practice the week leading up to the game. Beaty said Wyman’s punting was an important aspect to the game. \n“We’ll bounce back. We work hard,” Wyman said. “I blame it on myself — these misses — just mental errors.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:40:20.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
