Jazz's offense completely stalls against Portland \nThe Jazz put up only 81 points on offense tonight. That's bad, and continues a trend we've seen since the Phoenix game: in their last seven quarters, the Jazz have only put up 136 points total, good for an average of only 19.4 points per quarter. \nSo what happened? Well tonight's offensive performance against Portland was the result of poor ball movement and execution, which led to non-ideal shot opportunities. Then, the Jazz made those at a horrific rate. \nAs Quin Snyder put it, \"The ball sticks when you're not efficient, when you're not spaced well and there is nowhere to pass it. When you do pass it, it doesn't really do anything. It doesn't create much.\" \nOverall, the Jazz shot just 9-42, or 21 percent, on shots outside of the paint. That's very bad, and will make it nearly impossible to win games. \nBut the inside shots weren't going down, either. The Jazz were only 11-25 from within the restricted area, only 44 percent. That's bad too. \n\"We weren't very good offensively. We didn't make plays. We didn't make shots. We have to learn to be better.\" \n2. Jazz played a lot of quadruple wing lineups \nThe \"Quadruple Wing\" lineup is an unusual look for two reasons: it features neither a traditional point guard and only one traditional big at a time. Tonight, due to Rudy Gobert's foul trouble and their point guards' inability to score, the Jazz went to this unusual look early and often. \nBurks/Favors/Hayward/Ingles/Millsap played 3:04, and finished +4. Favors/Hayward/Hood/Ingles/Millsap played 1:03, and finished +1. Hayward/Hood/Ingles/Millsap/Withey played 2:26, and finished +4. Hood/Johnson/Ingles/Millsap/Withey played 1:17, and finished +2. Burks/Johnson/Ingles/Millsap/Withey played 1:08, and finished -1. Burks/Hayward/Favors/Johnson/Millsap played 2:41, and finished +1. Burks/Gobert/Hayward/Hood/Millsap played 0:53, and finished -2. Burks/Gobert/Hayward/Johnso Gobert/Hayward/Hood/Johnson/Ingles played 1:01, and finished even. Burks/Gobert/Hayward/Hood/Ingles played 0:41, and finished -2 before intentional fouling started at the end of the game. \n3. Tom Thibodeau sat next to Jerry Sloan \nThis is a very gossipy point, but I think it's interesting. \nOkay, okay, perhaps Sloan was more well known for his years coaching the Jazz. \nTom Thibodeau, the winning coach in Jerry Sloan's last career game, is seated next to him on the 11th row tonight. Two ex-Bulls coaches. Kurt Kragthorpe (@tribkurt) October 13, 2015 â€” Laird Doman (@lairddoman) October 13, 2015 \nBut, and forgive me for the imaginative leap, what if Thibodeau were somehow to advise the Jazz? Remember, Thibodeau was a fantastic defensive assistant for the Boston Celtics before leaving to coach the Chicago Bulls, at both places, he led either the first or second-best defense in the league for multiple seasons. \nAnd moreover, Snyder said this about Thibodeau in March: \n\"Thibodeau's the dean of all defense. If you do what Thibodeau does, by and large, it's going to work out.\" \nCan you imagine the effectiveness of the Jazz's defense, which was already number one in the league by a large margin during the second half of last season, with the benefit of Thibodeau's coaching? It'd be the \"immovable object\" of NBA defenses. It'd be legendary. \nAgain, there's no indication that a partnership is actually occurring. But a man can dream. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:14:04.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
