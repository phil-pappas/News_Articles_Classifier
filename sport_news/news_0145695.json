To his surprise, Miguel Rodriguez — an officer at the airport who had overheard his phone call — told the agent that Eddie was speaking with about a Facebook post he'd spotted, seeking the owner of a lost teddy bear.\n\"Let's help him find his home,\" the post read, in part, with a picture of Teddy. As of this writing, it's been shared more than 28,200 times.\nRodriguez put Eddie in touch with the Facebook user responsible for Teddy's discovery, Ann Marie Kernick of Raleigh, N.C.\nTeddy was shipped home and reunited with Abby the next day.\n\"To say we were ecstatic would be an understatement,\" Eddie said.\nPlease share. I found this guy at the John Wayne Airport in Orange County Airport in California. Let's help him find his home.\nPosted by Ann Marie Kernick on Monday, September 7, 2015 Their friendship began when Abby was only 2 years old and Teddy comforted her when she wasn't feeling well. Since then, the slightly tethered, but cuddly bear has remained a part of the McCoy family.\n\"She just loves him to death,\" Abby's mom, Anna McCoy, said. \"He comforts her and he's familiar.\"\nBut this airport incident wasn't the first time Abby had lost Teddy. In fact, according to Anna, Teddy has been lost at least eight times — a few times at Disney World, grandma's house, Perimeter Mall, Six Feet Under, the dentist's office and more.\n\"Every time we think he's gone for good, he pops right back up,\" Anna said. \"Sometimes I think he's trying to escape and he's just not very successful.\"", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/08/62/e7/teddysmile.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/annmariekernick", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153164470196167&set=a.10150332681696167.339467.711656166&type=3"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:08:29.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
