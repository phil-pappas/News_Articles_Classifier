(CBS12) - There's more proof in Vero Beach this week that golf is a game for life. The John's Island Club is hosting the U.S. Mid Amateur Championship, where elite golfers from all walks of life and all over the World are continuing to chase their golf dreams. \nRoyal Palm Beach's Daniel Eggertsson is among the 264 golfers who qualified, and is a former All-America punter at Franklin & Marshall College. His playing partner on Saturday was David Delich, who's a former Team USA hockey player back in the \"Miracle on Ice\" era, winning several gold medals for his country. Both Delich and Eggertsson say their former sports drive them to continue to be competitive in golf as long as they can. \n\"You try to transfer that mentality, don't ever quit don't ever give up,\" explains Delich, \"there's a way to win, you've just got to figure out where it is.\" \n\"Every shot in golf is different, just like every field goal,\" says Eggertsson, \"I want to stay healthy and active my whole life and try to get better at golf.\" \nThis is Eggerttson's second USGA Championship, having also competed in this year's U.S. Amateur Four-Ball.
