Quick Clicks Live: Central Fla. HS football scores \nEverett Golson, who passed for 372 yards and three touchdowns, gave the Seminoles the lead for good with 8:05 remaining in the third quarter as he connected with Kermit Whitfield for a 70-yard touchdown up the right sideline. It is the eighth 300-yard passing game of Golson's career and his second since transferring to Florida State earlier this summer. \nGolson completed passes to seven players. Whitfield set career highs for receptions (nine) and yards (172). \nDalvin Cook had his fourth 100-yard rushing game of the season with 163 yards on 22 carries and a pair of touchdowns. Cook's 54-yard touchdown, where he broke four Louisville tackles, gave the Seminoles a 13-7 lead early in the third quarter and marked his fourth score of 50-plus yards this season. \nCook has 955 yards through six games, which according to STATS is the most by an ACC running back since 1996. The previous mark was 888 yards by Virginia's Thomas Jones in 1998. \nFlorida State remains the only team in the nation without an offensive turnover. \nLouisville (2-4, 1-2 ACC) was able to stay with the Seminoles for two-and-a-half quarters, but two turnovers in the third quarter derailed any momentum. Lamar Jackson, who grew up in Pompano Beach, Florida, and came into the game with a 53.6 completion percentage, passed for a career-high 307 yards. James Quick had five receptions for 130 yards and three touchdowns. \nThe Cardinals had a 7-6 lead at halftime on a 18-yard touchdown pass from Jackson to Quick. Florida State's lone points in the first half came on a pair of Roberto Aguayo field goals. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
