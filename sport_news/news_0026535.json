I was taking too many sacks. We had opportunities out there. We just didn't take advantage of them.\" \nUtah (6-0, 3-0) went into halftime with a 14-10 lead as both teams struggled to generate much offense. \nUtah quarterback Travis Wilson found his stride on the two scoring drives, completing 11 of 12 passes with two touchdowns. He completed 7 of 12 passes on the other five drives that all resulted in punts. \n\"I was texting Travis the other day that I want him to leave a legacy here at Utah,\" said receiver Kenneth Scott, who had a career-high 166 receiving yards. \"He gets a lot of scrutiny, but I want to him to be a player everyone remembers here.\" \nArizona State (4-3, 2-2) brought plenty of pressure. The Sun Devils entered the game blitzing on 55 percent of their plays and tied for No. 7 in the nation with 19 sacks. The Utes had given up two sacks in their first five games — the second fewest in the country — but Arizona State got two in the first half and finished with five. \n\"We needed to shut them down,\" Arizona State coach Todd Graham said. \"It was a defensive struggle. We made too many mental errors on the back end. \n\"You look at the game. We couldn't' run the ball and they couldn't either. It (came) down to passing the football.\" \nUtah rushed for minus-2 yards in the first half, but Wilson picked things up with 220 yards through the air, throwing touchdown passes to Scott and Harris Handley. The Sun Devils managed just three first downs and 91 yards in the first 30 minutes, with Bercovici completing 6 of 13 passes. \n\"We didn't move the ball enough for our defense and special teams, who played outstanding tonight,\" Bercovici said. \nAll of Arizona State's scoring came off special teams. Tim White had a 100-yard kickoff return down the right sideline for a score after Utah took a 7-0 lead. The Sun Devils went up 10-7 on a 34-yard field goal after De'Chavon Hayes returned a punt 48 yards. Hayes had one man to beat, punter Tom Hackett, but was tripped up. \nUtah gave up a safety on a failed trick kickoff return where Britain Covey threw an illegal forward pass in the end zone to Bubba Poole. Arizona State added three more points on the ensuing possession to take an 18-14 lead in the third quarter. \nDevontae Booker's 25-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter gave Utah a 21-18 lead it never relinquished. He finished with 118 yards rushing and two touchdowns. Sixty-two of those yards came on a touchdown run with 1:11 left in the game. \n\"I always say I get stronger as the game goes on,\" Booker said. \"They were stopping me for a lot of the game, but you can only hold off the beast for so long.\" \nBercovici threw for 242 yards and one interception, and Kalen Ballage had 49 yards on 18 carries. Devin Lucien led ASU with six receptions for 118 yards. Jordan Simone had a game-high 12 tackles as he and DJ Calhoun had two sacks apiece. \n\"We were not going to be denied,\" said Utah coach Kyle Whittingham, who called his players 'Warriors.' \"They were focused and on a mission. They were not going to be denied in that fourth quarter. \n\"We have a plan to win and that's part of the equation.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:30:08.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
