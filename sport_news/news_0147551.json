I maybe didn't expect it to go this well. \n\"At the start of the season I set myself a target to try to become a regular in the Under-21s and try to get a few starts in the Premier League. \n\"Obviously, I've got a few starts already, so it's been a great start and I can't thank the players and staff enough for helping me settle in and play as well as I have been.\" \nThursday was certainly an unforgettable day for Alli and was one which almost got even better. \nThe 19-year-old produced another impressive as Spurs took on Monaco in the Europa League and nearly made the breakthrough in the principality. \nAlli's first-half shot was smothered and the ball was instead prodded home by Erik Lamela - who had started the move with some exquisite quick feet - to set Mauricio Pochettino's side on course for what looked to be another Group J win. \nHowever, a late header from substitute Stephan El Shaarawy saw the encounter end in 1-1 draw, leaving Alli ruing what could have been. \n\"It feels like a defeat,\" he told Spurs TV. \n\"It was a strong first half from us and maybe we could have seen the game out, finished a few more chances but it wasn't to be. \n\"I think it shows how well we are doing at the minute, obviously to come away to Monaco and 1-1 to feel like a loss. \n\"The boys are down and I think it is important we pick ourselves up again and take the positives from this game into the game at Swansea.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:36:44.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
