Following the hot start in 2011, the Tar Heels lost four of their next five games and ultimately their bowl game in finishing 7-6. \n“It’s all good when people are patting you on the back, telling you you’re doing a good job and winning games,” quarterback Marquise Williams said. “But as soon as you lose, that goes south. A lot of people are going to tell you how bad you suck and you need to do something else. It’s good when you’re winning, hopefully we can keep winning games and keep getting praise.” \nBased on the number of times it’s repeated, the 5-1, 2-0 ACC record and five-game win streak really just means the Tar Heels can’t get complacent with their success. \n“It lets you know that each game we can come out and win football games if we just execute in the game system,” Williams said. “Being 5-1, we just can’t get complacent, we’ve got to keep coming out each day in practice and executing and doing what you need to do to be 6-1, 7-1. We have to keep our foot on the gas.” \nNot that the streak or history matters to the team, but a win against Virginia (2-4, 1-1 ACC) would give the Tar Heels their longest win streak since winning eight straight in 1997. \nWhat does matter is that UNC wins that next game, the team insists, and there’s only one way to do it. \n“We continue to keep doing the same things. I talked about it with them the other day – don’t forget what it took to get to this point, what you’ve done, what you’ve put into it, it didn’t just happen,” Fedora said. “’You didn’t just walk out here and it happened like this.’ We want to keep doing that. \nThe Carolina head coach joked that his harping on the details may go “in one ear out the other,” but he’s still doing it every day to reemphasize it. \nUNC has improved this year in the offensive line’s ability to pick up on blitzes, as recently as learning on the first two drives against Wake Forest, and in the defensive line’s ability to pass rush quarterbacks – two things coaches have harped on since training camp. \n“We’re still not as good as we want to be on it,” defensive end Dajaun Drennon said of the unit’s pass rushing. “But I’m happy to see that we are getting after it.” \nThere are still three key areas where Fedora isn’t seeing what he wants from his team. The special teams unit has yet to make a game-changing play (that wasn’t waved off), the offense is inconsistent – starting slow and turning the ball over far more often than the coach and team would like – and the red zone defense is below Fedora’s desired 50 percent. \nVirginia’s record fails to reflect the quality of opponent that comes to Kenan Stadium this week, Fedora believes, leaving no room for those weaknesses to persist. \n“If you really look at Virginia, their four losses were against teams that were all ranked at one point,” he said. “They’ve played a difficult schedule. When I look at that film, I’m saying ‘That’s a good football team that’s going to come in here.’ They lost four games, but (against) UCLA, Pitt, Notre Dame, Boise State. They’re going to come into our stadium and expect to win a football game.” \nThe coach gets that his impression of the foe may not be the first impression his team has of Virginia, but he’s setting his team straight. \n“I get them to the second glace real quick,” he said. \nAnd it seems the players understand what they’re looking at next. \n“When you play a schedule like that, it definitely toughens you up,” Hood said. “They’re used to seeing talented players, guys who can do a lot of things. So, they won’t be phased by us for sure.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:41:38.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
