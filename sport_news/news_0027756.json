The afternoon has been filled with plenty of sunshine and temperatures in the upper 50s to 60s. \nThe clear skies remain tonight with low temperatures a little warmer than last night, ranging in the 30s and 40s. \nSunday will be even warmer with highs in the mid to upper 60s for the east, mid-70s for central South Dakota and 70s to near 80 degree highs are possible for the west. More sunshine is expected with sustained winds picking up speed around 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 30 mph. \nNext week has a chance for rain. An area of upper level low pressure could get cut off from the jet stream and get stuck over the desert southwest. If that happens, KELOLAND will see a few rounds of light rain with a heavier rain event at the end of the week when the upper level low moves on. Otherwise, partly sunny skies between the rains with highs mostly in the 60s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:17:34.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
