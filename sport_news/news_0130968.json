It was the fifth straight time they have taken the lead in the opening round of this one-sided contest, and the three-point lead was their largest margin since they had a four-point lead in 2007 in Canada.\nThe Americans are going for their sixth straight victory and, after one day at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, there was a familiar feel to the event.\nThe South African duo of Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace won the only match for the International side, beating Matt Kuchar and Patrick Reed 3 and 2.\nEven so, this was another strong display by the U.S., which never trailed in the other four matches and has lost only one time in the Presidents Cup since it began in 1994.\nMost popular sports stories Collins is relaxed and rewarded with Mets in playoffs Darling on Harvey: 'It's not a big thing' Sabathia checks into rehab, will miss playoffs Porzingis enjoys battling for starting job Yankees eliminated from playoffs by Astros Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker topped India's Anirban Lahiri and Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee 5 and 4.\nJordan Spieth, the No. 1 player in the world, and Dustin Johnson proved as formidable as advertised in a 4-and-3 win over New Zealand's Danny Lee and Australia's Marc Leishman. Bubba Watson and J.B. Holmes, two of the longest hitters in golf, beat Australia's Adam Scott and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama 3 and 2.\nJason Day and Australian compatriot Steven Bowditch were 2 down to Mickelson and Zach Johnson with two holes to play when Day poured in a 40-foot birdie putt to send the match to the 18th. Bowditch hit a long iron to about 18 feet for an eagle chance, though Mickelson pounded his tee shot so far that Johnson was able to stick his approach to 10 feet. Day narrowly missed the eagle putt, and conceded the eagle to the Americans for a 2-up win. Mickelson, who has never missed a Presidents Cup, tied a tournament record with his 11th foursomes victory. Tiger Woods also has 11 foursomes wins.\nThere are five fourballs matches Friday.\nLPGA MALAYSIA\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Alison Lee shot a 6-under 65 for a share of the first-round lead with China's Xi Yu Lin in the LPGA Malaysia, the American's first event since her emotional Solheim Cup debut.\nLee birdied five of the first eight holes at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club, and added birdies on Nos. 12 and 14. The 20-year-old UCLA student bogeyed the par-3 17th and -- after rain and lightning delayed play more than three hours -- got up-and-down for par on the par-4 18th.\nIn the Solheim Cup last month in Germany, Lee was in tears after Suzann Pettersen called for the American to be penalized for picking up her ball when she mistakenly thought a short putt had been conceded in the completion of a fourballs match. Infuriated, the U.S. rallied to beat Europe in the biggest comeback in event history, with Lee winning her singles match.\nLin three-putted the 18th for her only bogey.\nMichelle Wie was a stroke back along with defending champion Shanshan Feng, Yani Tseng and Chella Choi. Finally over hip and ankle injuries, Wie had eight birdies and three bogeys.\nBRITISH MASTERS\nWOBURN, England (AP) -- England's Matthew Fitzpatrick birdied the final two holes for a 7-under 64 and a one-stroke lead in the British Masters.\nThe 21-year-old Fitzpatrick had an eagle, six birdies and a bogey on Woburn's Marquess Course. He won the 2013 U.S Amateur.\nScotland's Marc Warren, England's Lee Slattery, Denmark's Soren Kjeldsen and Sweden's Robert Karlsson were tied for second. Ian Poulter, hosting the tournament at his home course, had a 68.\nU.S. MID-AMATEUR\nVERO BEACH, Fla.
