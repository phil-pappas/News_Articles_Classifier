(AP) - A burn ban has been issued for Washington County.\nThe county's Board of Supervisors issued the ban after hearing a report Monday from the county's fire marshal, James Stewart.\nThe Delta Democrat-Times reports ( http://bit.ly/1LzgCJu ) the ban is in effect until further notice.\nStewart says the county and state are extremely dry right now. As a result, fire activity has increased. He says a spark from equipment, embers from a barbecue or any other similar heat source could start a fire.\nAnyone caught burning during the ban can face misdemeanor charges, which carry a fine between $100 and $500. Residents also could potentially face jail time for failure to comply with the notice.\nInformation from: Delta Democrat-Times, http://www.ddtonline.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
