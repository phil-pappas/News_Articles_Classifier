Prosise, which was precisely the problem in Notre Dame's 24-22 loss to Clemson on Saturday. Prosise averaged 150 yards per game coming in but was held to 50 yards on 15 carries. Notre Dame failed to get its ground game going (116 yards) but still outgained the Tigers 437-296.\nOffense\nD. Three turnovers will get you this grade. So will an offensive line that allowed its rushers to be tackled for a loss on more than 27 percent of its 33 attempts and allowed four sacks for 18 yards in losses.\nDefense\nB. After giving up 116 yards and two touchdowns on Clemson's 15 plays in the first, the Irish allowed 180 on 49 and one TD the rest of the way.\nSpecial teams\nD. A 15-yard shanked punt in the first quarter led to a Clemson touchdown. A fumbled kickoff, forced by the kicker, to start the second half led to another. Two two-point conversions failed, including one that would have tied the score with seven seconds left.\nCoaching\nD. Going for two (and failing) with the score 21-9 early in the fourth was a head-scratcher. The Irish could have kicked the PAT and been down by 11, and later 14 after a Clemson field goal. Instead they were forced to go for two late.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561287bc/turbine/ct-notre-dame-grades-spt-1005-20151004"], "published": "2015-10-05T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:07:57.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
