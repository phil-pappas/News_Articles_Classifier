We can never have a competitive program without a defense stronger than we have now. Fire the OC because he can’t keep up with what the defense is giving up is crazy. We just lost to the second worst team in the SEC west, not because we didn’t score enough, it was because we gave up too much. You want victory, get a defense, dominate 3rd downs. We do not have the skill set on defense to win these games. We are getting better, but we are miles away from being better than 6-6. Captain Obvious October 18, 2015 at 1:03 pm | Permalink \nWow….

The offense has to do something as well ya know. Those dropped passes and interceptions dont help anybody including team morale. BluVoodo October 18, 2015 at 5:56 pm | Permalink \nAdjustments after the half are great, no doubt. Too bad we had to wait until Half. We still gave up 30, first half or second half we won’t win giving up 30 points a game.

Radmankd October 18, 2015 at 1:26 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI’m happy with Coach Dawson. One play didn’t beat us. How many throws down field would we have seen with Neal Brown? Remember last year, all the screens and horizontal throws? We don’t know what all goes on in practice and during a game. You have to work with what you have also. We know the offensive line is having issues and Towles is very inconsistent. I give Dawson credit for continuing to throw the ball when it’s there even when Towles is struggling. Brown would just chuck the passing game. I was questioning the wisdom, particularly in the first half, of the situational defensive substitutions when Auburn was hurrying. Defense was barely set at the snap, not to mention, the energy spent by players busting butt to get off or on the field. Defensive depth is not our strong point. We have to continue to recruit better players and continue to develop our guys once they’re here. All in. Go Big Blue! Katmandue2you October 18, 2015 at 1:28 pm | Permalink | Reply \nAsk the experts…I will just say this….yes defense does or is critical in winning championships. But I think its fair to point out that we held Florida to half the points that LSU (the only undefeated team in the league) did….or than Tennessee or Ole Miss did. Our defense is extremely improved just like the rest of our team. We are winning and losing due to all phases of the game. Our kicking game killed us Thursday. Dropped balls killed us on two key occasions. And yes not getting off the field on 3rd down in the first half killed us. But its sure not just defense. Nor is it bad play calling….that’s just preposterous. And I think we have to wait and see how Auburn finishes the season. Yeah they were very lacking coming up to our game. I didn’t see that same Auburn Thursday night. Lets see what they do going forward. Just like lets see what we do. I don’t rule out a win at MIss State but it will be tough. UK Big Board Update October 18, 2015 at 1:40 pm | Permalink \nLol. Why don’t you apply those great analytics to the powerhouse EKU that whipped us all over the field? Keep believing like you have for 25 yrs now. And at the end of the year just bury your head in the sand and hope for basketball season to start up soon! Katmandue2you October 18, 2015 at 1:52 pm | Permalink | Reply \nAnd just a comment about Towles. I understand he has been inconsistent at times. I’m not sure “very inconsistent” is close to accurate. We have a quarterback that passed for 359 yards on 27 of 44 with 3 drops (one in the endzone) and that’s not counting that last incomplete pass that likely would have won the game (it was dropped but broken up by the defender). Had those 3 catches been made he would have been 30 of 44 for around 400 yards. Is anyone watching the other teams in the league? Anyone watch A&M quarterback yesterday (3 pick 6’s)? Anyone watch Auburns quarterbacking prior to our game with them? Anyone watch Georgia”s quarterbacking against Mizzou….3 field goals no touchdowns. Ya’ll realize that Florida or LSU would kill to have our QB? Ya’ll realize how good they would be with him? Let me throw it out there and see what the responses are. Towles is easily one of the 4 best quarterbacks in the SEC. We have a vertical passing game many teams would die for. He is a legitimate NFL prospect. Ya’ll realize this??? BBN October 18, 2015 at 2:16 pm | Permalink \nThanks for the analysis Mel Kiper Jr. Always thought he was an NFL quarterback – first thing the NFL looks for is a guy that can throw it down the field 45 yards. They’re not so much looking for a guy that can progress through his receivers to find the third or fourth receiver. Name me the last time he progressed through routes and checked off the primary receiver? Remember Jamarcus Russell, Akili Smith, Ryan Leaf, etc – they all had ability to throw the deep ball. How long did their careers last? Having said that, don’t believe it’s towles fault. Stoops is in year 3 – there should be another quarterback that can be put in. I could care less about passing percentages, which happens to be one of the biggest non-factors in football. Stat that matters – turnovers. This year – 8 td’s, 7 int’s – from a 4th year junior. Don’t care if he throws for 5000 yards if he basically throws same number of touchdowns as interceptions – by the way, neither does the NFL. They don’t really care about winning (note sarcasm). 8 god October 18, 2015 at 2:57 pm | Permalink \nThat touchdown number looks a lot better when you add in his rushing TDs. BBN October 18, 2015 at 3:10 pm | Permalink \nHe’s got three rushing td’s so you’re right it’s more than 8. 11tds 7ints – very good stats. Thanks for the humor.

The Professor October 18, 2015 at 2:28 pm | Permalink | Reply \nThere was pretty unanimous opinion after the Florida game that it was a play calling disaster. We could not run and yet he continued to call the same running plays. We did not have time to run deep routes yet he kept calling for throwing long rather than shorter passes. Auburn was an improvement but the run call on the last drive ended badly. Dawson’s performance does not warrant a $500,000 salary. ukcats42301 October 18, 2015 at 2:36 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI like Mark Stoops but it is frustrating to see a team like Memphis who has a worse history than UK do what they are doing with supposedly lesser recruits. I kind of discounted them until yesterday because of the schedule they play but they absolutely dominated Ole Miss a team that dominated Alabama. It’s hard to be told to just be patientyear after year when you see a team like that having the success they are, 13 game winning streak going back to last year. Their offense is outstanding. carvingitup October 18, 2015 at 3:39 pm | Permalink \nThe difference between Memphis and Kentucky is the imaginative run play calling. Misdirection and fake jet sweeps are just an example of how Memphis does it. All of Kentucky run plays are predetermined dives and not zone read plays. Most of UKs’ long runs have been on bounce outs or missed tackles leading to long runs. The Memphis defense is no better than Kentucky yet they find a way to win!

Is the program in better shape than it was under the jokester? Oh hell yes! But if it’s gonna continue to get better the qb play is gonna have to improve. That’s not gonna happen with blonde hair boy. For the sake of future improvement why not give Barker at least a series or two? Or was he as over hyped as Matt Elam? shepdog3270 October 18, 2015 at 2:51 pm | Permalink | Reply \nAnd here I thought Louisville fans were delusional….some of the comments here are flippin ridiculous…mistakes in football are going to happen, whether it is the QB, DB, LB, or OC, you would always love to have a few plays back. But to start questioning the ability of these guys to perform, well, that makes some of you look like the fat guy in the doughnut shop blaming his thyroid for his weight problem… BBN October 18, 2015 at 3:19 pm | Permalink \nBring Joker back-we shouldn’t really care about winning. Spending about 2500 yearly on tickets doesn’t give you the right to question play calling. I know my boss at work says after I make a mistake “that’s ok, you’ll get it right the next time.” Corn dog October 18, 2015 at 3:13 pm | Permalink | Reply \nThat makes no sense. The fans aren’t on the field making or not making plays. They’re paying the freight. They’re just tired of always getting their hopes up and being disappointed. Yes, things are getting better. But remember, this time last year the record was 5-1. Corn dog October 18, 2015 at 3:22 pm | Permalink \nAnd even though we can all see improvements, there are still things happening that make you shake your head. How many penalties for illegal substitutions? EIGHT players on the field for a punt return. And no matter how you spin it that running play on that last drive against Auburn was a horrible call, especially when it’s followed up by a long pass that had very little chance of completion against the defense Auburn was playing. You surely don’t expect fans to not question things like that., do you? Wildcatwill October 18, 2015 at 3:27 pm | Permalink | Reply \nGive me a break. Yes you can take a chance with that run play, If you have a frigging time out to call! Why when your trying to build a program do you hire a OC who has no game day play calling experience? Why can’t Mark Stopp put on the damn headset and be involved with the offense at critical times during the game? You think as the head coach he would want to have input or be able to see what the defense is doing and veto a call play. There won’t be another year where Auburn and Fla are as vulnerable as they were. I love UK but our wins have been against mediocre teams so far and we blew major opportunities to take the program farther up the ladder.

Just Say'n October 18, 2015 at 3:54 pm | Permalink | Reply \nWe needed 3.5 yds (that’s 3 1/2 for you geniuses) to get in 3 plays for a first down and totally blew it. The run call was atrocious, the ‘Hail Mary) down the sideline was atrocious, and the last play was double atrocious! We needed to get 10 yds at a time to get in to FG position and wasted 1:20 seconds trying to hit the ‘big one’. \nI’m not making $500,000 a year but I can guarantee you I could have called a better 2:00 drill for the Auburn game. \nAs for Towles, no one ever mentions the number of times our receivers save his sorry @ss throws by making circus catches. They’ve done everything but turn cartwheels trying to re-position themselves to catch underthrown, behind them, or overthrown balls. In addition to that, Towles NEVER looks off of what he deems to be his primary receiver at the snap. Just look at the number of times he doesn’t see a WIDE OPEN player on a route. That interception in the end zone against Auburn was the classic case of him not seeing a wide open receiver 3yds in front of a guy being double covered. \nUntil that changes we will continue to wallow in mediocrity. To some fans that’s acceptable. Not me, I’m sick about it, but after 49 yrs attending UK games I’m still going to hang in there hoping we ‘turn’ the corner. Adam October 18, 2015 at 4:00 pm | Permalink | Reply \nIt’s not that Patrick Towles is no good… he is. The problem is he just isn’t good enough to play in the SEC. Therefore, he isn’t good enough to play at UK. It is extremely obvious he decides before the play starts who he is throwing to. That’s why he holds the ball too long and gets sacked (the one receiver never got open). That’s why he misses wide open receivers and throws interceptions to the guy that’s covered (never even looked at the other receivers). He also has no idea how to step up in the pocket. If defenders break through, he immediately takes off sideways or backwards. Even when the line holds, and the one receiver he’s watching gets open… still throws it behind, over, under, or nowhere even close to the receiver. His game is good enough for… say… Hawaii, or Louisiana Tech, or maybe even Cincinnati. But he should not be in the SEC. There will be a time in the near future that we (UK) will be held back/limited to how good we can be as a team… because Towles ceiling just isn’t that high (unless something changes). Dieter October 18, 2015 at 4:37 pm | Permalink \nTowels isn’t “good enough” even though he’s given us a fighting chance in every game? No one plays perfect. If he’s not good enough, who is? Jalen Whitlow, Maxwell Smith, Shane Boyd, Dusty Bonner, or all the other losers we’ve had before – those who never gave us a chance? Bottom line is Towels is one of the top 5 or 6 UK QB’s of the last 20 years. Sure he misses some easy ones and I pull my hair out every time…but to say he isn’t “good enough for UK” shows how little you remember about the “quality” of most UK QB’s of the past. He’s better than most of them and it ain’t close. UK football fans need to slow down. Really, we’re “supposed” to be undefeated right now? We’d be ranked like 10th in the country if we were. We would’ve beaten a top 10 team in UF. This is honestly expected? Are you crazy? We’re right on track for a bowl game which was always the goal. With limited success, expectations have blown WAY out of proportion. This was always an 8-4 team at best, and I would be thrilled if that happened. That would be one of the all-time great UK football seasons. Nope, not “good enough” I guess. (sarcasm) Radmankd October 18, 2015 at 6:05 pm | Permalink \nDitto.
