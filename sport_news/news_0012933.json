Whitecwhite@mdjonline.com The Marietta Daily Journal October 16, 2015 12:18 AM | 53 views | 0 | 0 | | Ivan Walls and the Kell offense will try to find holes to run through against a Riverwood defense that is allowing only 6.5 points per game. If the Longhorns win, they will move into second place in Region 7 (B). Game: Riverwood (6-1, 4-0) at Kell (4-2, 2-1) 7:30 p.m. Last year: Kell 24, Riverwood 3All-time series: Kell leads 3-0Prediction: Kell 21, Riverwood 14Despite its Region 7 (B) loss to Cambridge three weeks ago, Kell still has a chance at playing for the region title, and Longhorns coach Derek Cook knows it.While having a 4-2 record and a region loss are uncharacteristic developments for Kell, which had gone three straight years without losing a region game, the Longhorns can better their position for a postseason bid with a win over Riverwood tonight.Kell is currently third in the subregion standings, but a victory over the Raiders would push the Longhorns into second and give them a tie-breaker edge over Riverwood if the teams remained tied going into the region play-in game.“We know the situation,” Cook said. “There are lots of situations — if we beat such and such and they lose to such and such, and all of that. We can’t concern ourselves with that. We have to focus on ourselves and not worry about what happens with other teams.“We only talk about what we have to control. We put our backs against the wall coming out of the gate, and now we have to take care business.”It won’t be easy against a Riverwood team that is already 4-0 in the subregion and capable of putting points on the board in bunches. The Raiders were 1-5 in the subregion a season ago and are playing a lot better this year.“Riverwood is a very athletic, physical and fast team,” Cook said. “They run the ball, and they can hurt you with the pass.“They have explosive plays at the ready, so it will be important for us to run the ball well and keep it out of their hands to limit their possessions.Coming out of its most recent bye week, Kell has had plenty of time to break down film and prepare for Riverwood. The Longhorns are in a good position to pick up the victory, sporting a 13-0 record since 2007 following bye weeks.“We got a chance to heal up,” Cook said. “We’re continuing to try to improve and, hopefully, the rest helps us in the weeks ahead.
