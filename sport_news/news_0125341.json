HPCC chief spokesperson Naresh Chauhan said Himachal had a democratically elected government which enjoyed clear majority in the House. “The Virbhadra-led government enjoys clear majority and full support of the people of Himachal Pradesh and such demands by BJP leaders, especially former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, seems illogical and against the democratic process in the country,” he said. Chauhan said that it seems that Dhumal and BJP leaders do not believe in democracy which is the reason he had time and again demanded the dissolution of the state government from Governor of the state. “Dhumal had repeated the statement of destabilising the state government umpteen times in the last two-and-a-half years,” he said. He said the Congress government was stable and would complete its term of five years as the party enjoyed full support of the people of state. He added that Dhumal and BJP leaders had not been able to digest the defeat in the 2012 Assembly polls which was the reason for their attempts to destabilise the Congress government in the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:06:04.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
