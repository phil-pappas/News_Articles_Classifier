Quarterback Bryant Shirreffs was only sacked twice this time. He was the leading rusher, with 90 yards on 17 carries. Fifty of those were on the Huskies' first and only touchdown – a scoring drive in the first quarter. The Huskies abandoned the run because they fell behind big early. Arkeel Newsome (11 for 47) never really had a chance to run the ball. D \nQuarterback: Shirreffs (12 of 27 for 87 yards, one interception) had a terrible time throwing in the rain. Interestingly enough, Kiel (26 of 35, 327 yards, two TDs) didn't have any problem and neither did his receivers. UConn receivers had some serious issues with catching the ball. The big takeaway from Shirreffs' effort is that he has to stop running so much. For the first time this season he had an extended stay in the locker room following the game getting treatment. He's trying. He's a gamer but sometimes he's taking off expecting the rush before it actually comes. He probably can't help that because most of the time it is coming and he doesn't like to take negative plays. Also, Shirreffs must improve on snapping the offense to the line when the huddle breaks so the offense can get plays off quicker and avoid clock management snafus before it costs the team a game. That's hardly all on Shirreffs but he can do a better job. C \nRunning back: Nobody ran the ball except Shirreffs and Newsome – unless you count Ron Johnson's one carry for zero yards. Newsome caught eight passes for 37 yards, which is the reason he's the starter. He versatile but he was limited against the Bearcats. C \nWide receiver/tight end: Too many drops in here. Noel Thomas (4 for 38) said the rain should not have been an excuse. Tyraq Beals (3 for 38) caught the ones thrown to him. Tight end Alec Bloom caught five balls for 97 yards Oct. 17. This week he caught zero and dropped a couple. Tommy Myers one catch, one yard? You know, UConn has good tight ends but boy do they have a tough chore, catching passes, staying in and blocking in the running game, and knowing all that window dressing (motion) before the play starts. Is all of that necessary? C minus \nSpecial teams: The coverage teams were fine and Justin Wain was too, though he didn't drop one of his five punts inside the 20, which is a little unusual for him — but would it really have made a difference if he did? Cincinnati's offense moved the ball at will after the opening drive. Bobby Puyol had two field goals, 27 yards in the second quarter and 30 in the fourth. You know when and why Puyol comes out. C plus \nDefense \nLine: This unit hasn't quite been what it was to start the season but it's still playing OK. It had a chore Saturday, though. Still, Foley Fatukasi was pretty active. He had five tackles and a sack. Julian Campenni had six tackles and Luke Carrezola had five, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery but what happened with Williams getting outside on the 84-yarder? C minus \nLinebacker: Their numbers say they were active. Junior Joseph had 16 tackles to lead both teams and Matt Walsh had seven, but where were they when big Mike Boone (13 for 117) broke through the line for 30- and 34-yard runs? C minus \nSecondary: It may be a tried and true style but it doesn't make it any easier to stomach opposing receivers knowing they can run routes underneath and have the space to do it. That's the style they're taught to play. And what about the keep points down element of the defense? And what does that matter if the UConn offense can't score? Watching receivers catch the ball for big gains is hard to watch. There were clear individual breakdowns in tackling, which was in all areas really, and in coverage. This unit has to step it up.
