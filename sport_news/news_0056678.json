Dye dribbled into the circle to find senior Rachel Stauffer on a cross, as she flicked the ball into the top of the net to give the Hoosiers an early 1-0 advantage.\nThree minutes later, however, Kent State junior Madison Thompson responded with a one-woman show. She picked off an IU pass and struck one into the net from the top half of the circle, tying the game 1-1.\nIU regained the lead two minutes later off its first penalty corner of the game, and sophomore Maddie Latino took the corner for the Hoosiers. As the ball was settled, Stauffer delivered a between-the-legs pass to find junior Kate Barber who dribbled into the circle and struck a ball from 15 feet out, which found Latino’s stick near the left post and was deflected into the net.\n“We started off a little panicky and just needed to calm it down,” Pearson said. “As a team we just need to stay composed on the ball and not rush anything, so we just went back to the basics and I think that really helped us in the end.”\nLatino added an insurance goal for IU 15 minutes into the second half off a rebounded shot saved by the goalkeeper, giving the reigning Big Ten Co-offensive Player of the Week back-to-back two-goal performances.\nUnfortunately for the Hoosiers, freshman goalkeeper Noelle Rother's 11 saves weren’t enough to stop Kent State from adding two late goals, including the game-tying goal with 2:18 remaining to push overtime.\n“The fight was always there,” Janney said. “The response and the ability to get back in the game and to get back on the attack was good. We were just on our defense end way too much for how good our team is.”\nKent State initially controlled the overtime period, but two big stops by Rother kept IU in the game and eventually led to the game-winning goal for Pearson.\nRiding their four-game win streak, the Hoosiers are taking their first overtime experience on the road to No. 16 Michigan (8-3) Sunday.\n“Overtime wins are always really exciting,” Janney said. “To get the experience in overtime that we haven’t had to go through yet, it’s really beneficial for a team later in the season that if we go to an overtime game, we’ll have the confidence to know we can win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:57:35.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
