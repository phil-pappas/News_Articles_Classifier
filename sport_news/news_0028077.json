But what if the judgment on the pitcher's worth is painted by our last impression? \nWhat will that last image -- a so-so, 50-pitch relief outing -- mean for Price's price tag come free agent time? And if you don't believe a few postseason games can alter opinions, compare the hot takes of Red Sox fans before and after watching the lefty give up eight runs on 11 hits over his first 10 innings of this postseason to what it was on the final day of the regular season. \nThe no-brainer notion of prioritizing Price in the upcoming offseason suddenly has been tempered in some corners. Why? Because now people can lump in the 30-year-old's 5.04 postseason ERA into the argument on if he's going to be worth the investment. \nThis is the bizarre world of baseball, where free agents can see their fortunes skyrocket or plummet because of their postseason performances. \n\"Nobody remembers how you start. They remember how you finish,\" former Red Sox catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia said just prior to the 2013 postseason. \"That's why it matters. As a player you always want to finish strong, because they remember that.\" \nIn the days after uttering those words, Saltalamacchia lived through the reality. The catcher who had totaled 40 doubles, 14 homers and an .804 OPS during the 2013 regular season, found his market thinned out by the time the offseason came around thanks to a postseason that resulted in a .188 batting average and .476 OPS in 10 games before being benched. \nSaltalmacchia got a three-year, $21 million deal from the Marlins, but considering the regular-season production of the then-28-year-old, the interest wasn't nearly what had been projected a few months earlier. \nThe flip side of the power of the postseason would be a player like Pablo Sandoval, who signed a contract with the Red Sox that will pay him $70 million over the next four years despite coming off a 2014 regular season that resulted in the 70th-best OPS in the major leagues (.739). But then there was that World Series run, which saw the third baseman hit .429 with a 1.002 OPS. \nThe Red Sox didn't sign Sandoval solely because of his postseason prowess, but it certainly didn't hurt when it came landing on a price tag. It was an example of an organization being able to point toward the ability to perform in a large market/big stage environment when justifying the investment. \nFor a player like Price, the effect of a postseason downturn most likely won't keep his payday under $200 million. But another perceived high-priced pitching target, Johnny Cueto, could fall victim to another round of raised eyebrows with a stinker in his own Game 5 Wednesday. \nThe pitcher once perceived to be on the same level as Price in regard to potential free agent dollars already has dipped thanks to a lackluster 4-7 record and 4.76 ERA during his regular-season stint with the Royals this summer. Then there are the rumors surrounding a less-than-healthy elbow, along with an uncomfortable six-inning, four-run outing in his Game 2 start against the Astros. \nMost of these free agents will get their money regardless of what transpires in October. But levels can, and will, be adjusted in the coming days or weeks. \nFor instance, don't you think Yoenis Cespedes made himself some money over the last week? \nOne could argue that the outfielder already staked his claim in the upcoming high-end free agent market thanks to a regular season in which he hit 35 home runs to go along with a .291 batting average and .870 OPS with both the Tigers and Mets. But what if his postseason was a disaster? All of a sudden teams would be reminded of the well-documented hole in Cespedes' swing, or the mediocre .744 combined OPS the previous two seasons. \nNow Cespedes -- a player with a sub-.300 on-base percentage in the previous two seasons -- has cemented one of this offseason's biggest paydays. \nThe soon-to-be-30-year-old now has seemingly put any doubts of his market to rest thanks to the continuation of an epic contract drive, hitting two more runs in the Mets' three playoff games. And with more postseason production will come more dollar signs. Just ask Carlos Beltran , who stormed into the free agent pool after hitting .435 with a gaudy 1.557 OPS in a dozen 2004 postseason games. The end result? A seven-year, $119 million deal from the Mets. \nThere are others who have something to gain for producing in a select few key moments. \nMike Napoli . Dioner Navarro. Daniel Murphy. Ben Zobrist. Austin Jackson . Dexter Fowler. And how about Colby Rasmus? \nThe 29-year-old, who signed a one-year, $9 million contract to play with the Astros this season, might be changing his narrative. \nThe regular season saw Rasmus turn in a productive, albeit somewhat flawed, season. He hit 25 homers with a .789 OPS, but saw his batting average land at .238, which was seven points below his career average. But now? \nBaseball is witnessing all that Toronto had hoped would emerge when the Jays acquired the once-top prospect from the Cardinals. The athletic outfielder has seven hits in 14 at-bats, walking seven times. He also has four home runs. That, my friends, translates into an OPS of 2.095. His division series OPS of 2.160 is the third best of all-time, trailing only David Ortiz's 2.418 in 2007 and Chicago's Jorge Soler's current run of 2.341. \nThe reality is that whomever signs Rasmus will get a guy who strikes out a ton, doesn't get on base a whole lot but hits with power and can go get the ball in the outfield. And they will be paying more for those services than they probably would have if Houston didn't make the playoffs. \n\"It can be important, but I think you have to look at every circumstance and sort of inspect why guys do certain ways,\" Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said when asked about how he views the value of postseason performance when signing a player. \"I can just reflect from my own situation. It’s hard to believe that when Justin Verlander first started he didn’t perform very well in the postseason. Part of it, he was so amped up at that time, he just had a little bit extra adrenaline flowing, and then over time, even though that adrenaline was still flowing, he kept it more under control and then as you know, went on and dominated in the postseason. \n\"So sometimes it’s just a process for guys. Of course, you’d love people to dominate any time you talk about the postseason. You’d love people to be Madison Bumgarner all the time when you go out there, but it’s difficult to do. It’s involved in your conversations.\" \nThey're conversations that continue to keep on changing thanks to the wonderful world of playoff baseball.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:28:09.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
