The team that placed first in the conference during the regular season will play the lowest-ranked team remaining after the first playoff round, while the team that placed first in the conference during the regular season will host the second-lowest ranked team that remains after the first playoff round.\nThe conference semifinal is played using an aggregate score, meaning the team who scores the most goals over both games goes through to the conference final.\nThe conference final matches are scheduled for Nov. 22 and Nov. 29. They are also played as an aggregate—with the team scoring the most goals over both games combined moving forward.\nThe final, to decide the winner of the MLS Cup, will be held on Dec. 6, with the highest-ranked team remaining from the regular season awarded home field advantage.\nTickets:\nCurrent season and partial season ticket holders and those seeking season tickets for the 2016 season will have first crack at tickets for the playoffs. Those who sign up at the Toronto FC website as “Insiders” will have the opportunity to buy tickets starting on Oct. 21, and tickets will go on sale for the general public on Oct. 22.\nPlayers to watch:\nSebastian Giovinco: Also known as the “Atomic Ant” for his speed, power and small stature, the Italian national team member scored 22 goals and notched 12 assists for Toronto FC so far this season, also racking up several hat tricks. He came to Toronto FC from Italian giants Juventus F.C. at the start of this season, and earns $7 million USD per year, making him the highest paid player in Major League Soccer, and the highest paid Italian soccer player in the world.\nMichael Bradley: As captain of Toronto FC and the U.S. men’s national team, this 28-year-old midfielder scored five goals and earned three assists for the club so far this season. Bradley is described as an attacking midfielder, adept at distributing the ball but also tracking back to help defenders in need.\nJozy Altidore: Dogged by injury, this forward also plays for the U.S. men’s national team and has scored 12 goals in 24 games for Toronto FC so far this season. He’s played in the Dutch, Spanish and English premier leagues, and remains the only American to score goals for his country in five games in a row.\n*If Toronto FC finishes the regular season third in its conference or lower, they will play a one-game playoff against another team in the conference on either Oct. 28 or Oct. 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:55:48.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
