The same can’t be said for their next opponent. The Dallas Cowboys, who went 12-4 and finished first in the NFC East last season for the first time since 2009, are 2-2 after suffering consecutive losses, the latest on the road and in overtime to the New Orleans Saints. So the Cowboys are in a fragile state emotionally. Physically they’re a certified wreck and will be missing at least six key contributors Sunday when the Patriots make their first visit to AT&T Stadium. The list includes Pro Bowl quarterback Tony Romo, All-Pro receiver Dez Bryant, shutdown cornerback Orlando Scandrick and, possibly, linebacker and leading tackler Sean Lee. That, of course, is no problem of the Patriots'. “There’s no letdown for us,” quarterback Tom Brady said Wednesday. “We’re trying to establish a certain level of play, and we got off to a decent start this year. So we’ve got to keep it going. You know, we’ve got to sustain good practices, good games, good weeks, and see if we can just keep building. “[The Cowboys] could easily be 4-0. They’re playing at home. They’ve got a lot of good players, very talented team. Last year they were one of the best teams in football. They could’ve beaten the Saints easily last week in overtime, so they’re a very good football team. I know it’s going to be a big test for our team.” Brady is scheduled to make his 100th consecutive regular-season start Sunday, a streak that stretches to Week One of the 2009 season. He’s as proud of his durability as he is his productivity, which has resulted in 10 Pro Bowl selections, six Super Bowl appearances and four Lombardi Trophy-lifting moments. “Well, I’m happy I’m available to my team,” Brady said. “I think that’s something I’ve always taken a lot of pride in, so trying to be out there and be a consistent, dependable player and certainly being available to those guys is what my job is. “It’s pretty fun. It’s great to go out there and play a lot of football, and I’ve been very fortunate to be protected so well by the offensive line. So a lot of good luck, it all helps.” Brady also has a streak of 111 consecutive regular-season starts on his résumé, a run that ended after suffering a season-ending knee injury in Week One of the 2008 season. Page 2 of 2 - Only eight quarterbacks in NFL history have ever made at least 100 straight starts, with the all-time leader being Brett Favre (297) and the active leader being the New York Giants’ Eli Manning (171). Brady is the only player to have two triple-digit runs. The next game Brady appears in will be his 213th, which would break the franchise record he presently shares with Patriots Hall of Fame left tackle Bruce Armstrong. Armstrong started every game he played during his 14 seasons in Foxboro, so Brady needs three more starts to claim that mark. The other relevant numbers with regard to Brady are a completion percentage of 72.2 -- well above his career average of 63.5 entering the season -- nine touchdowns and no interceptions while presiding over an offense that ranks first in the league in both yards (446.3) and scoring (39.7). Brady turned 38 in August and, as many pigskin pundits have proclaimed, is playing as well as -- if not better -- than at any point in his 16-year career. How is he doing it? “He works really hard to prepare and play, so you’d probably have to talk to him about his individual things he does,” coach Bill Belichick said to the Dallas media in a conference call. “He’s always been a hard-working guy in the building, watches a lot of film, works hard on his situations, his techniques, throwing mechanics, things like that. That’s been pretty consistent through his career from what I seen.” By RICH GARVEN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:33:40.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
