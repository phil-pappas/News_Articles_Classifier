The Mean Green are 1-37 on the road in nonconference play in that span and have lost 12 straight, a streak the Mean Green will try to snap today in a game at Iowa that comes at a less than ideal time.\nUNT has already lost its first two games, including its Conference USA opener last week to Rice.\nThe Mean Green could really use a win at this point and will have to break through in a situation they have struggled with for more than a decade.\nIowa is off to a 3-0 start and is on the verge of breaking into the Associated Press Top 25 poll.\n\"They are physical, talented, confident and have a lot of really good college football players,\" UNT coach Dan McCarney said. \"They have a number of guys who will play at the next level.\"\nAll the Mean Green are worried about at this point is taking their game up another notch after showing improvement last week in a 38-24 loss to Rice. That outcome might not sound all that encouraging, but UNT played better in several facets after a season-opening loss to SMU.\nQuarterback Andrew McNulty threw for a career high 303 yards and wide receiver Carlos Harris finished with 193 yards against the Owls just one week after the Mean Green managed just 240 total yards in their loss to the Mustangs.\n\"We showed a lot good stuff for the last two weeks,\" UNT center Kaydon Kirby said. \"We had some downs and some ups. The best thing you can do is build off the ups.\"\nThe Mean Green will have to build on those positives to have a chance against Iowa.\nThe Hawkeyes have already beaten rival Iowa State and also knocked off Pittsburgh 27-24 last week when Marshall Koehn nailed a 57-yard field goal as time expired.\nIowa ranks fifth nationally in rushing defense with an average of 51.0 yards allowed a game.\n\"Iowa is off to a great start and does a lot of things well both offensively and defensively,\" UNT quarterback Andrew McNulty said. \"They pose a great challenge for us.\"\nUNT is familiar with the challenge the game will present. The Mean Green have faced plenty of tough teams on the road in nonconference play through the years and will look to pull a rare upset at a time they are trying to turn their season around.\n\"The season is a long way from being over,\" McCarney said. \"No one around here is depressed. We played two games and came up short.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:25:46.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
