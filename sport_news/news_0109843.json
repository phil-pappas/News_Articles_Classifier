Wayne Hills became just the second team in Passaic history to sweep the boys and girls team and individual titles, beating Passaic Tech, 46-61, for the boys team title and Clifton, 24-62, for the girls crown as Galkin’s classmate Katerina Zachmann won the girls race in 19:28. \nGalkin put on a huge surge at the start of the long final hill on the Garret Mountain 5,000-meter course to break open what had been a tight race with Kennedy freshman Jaron Jordan, and with about 350 meters to go appeared to be cruising to an overwhelming victory and one of the 10 fastest times on the course in Passaic County history. \nBut the toll the sprint took on Galkin nearly cost him. \nAs he rounded the big tree that serves as the start of a 150-meter push to the finish line, he looked rubbery-legged and pale, but somehow managed to stagger to the finish line in a personal-best 16:35 for the victory and then collapsed, dehydrated by his effort. Jordan slipped to third behind Joe Zisa of Wayne Hills. \n“I think I fiercely overdid [the sprint],” said Galkin, who was tended to by the meet’s trainer and Galkin’s father, a veteran marathoner, for nearly a half hour. “I passed him as we came out of the woods and then I tried to crush him and take the kick out of him, and then I didn’t realize how much ahead I had gotten and kept pushing. Then it hit me and when I went around the tree I was just trying to finish and not fall down until I did.” \nGalkin never got to see the girls race, although he had recovered enough from his ordeal to go out to dinner with his family three hours later. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:33:01.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
