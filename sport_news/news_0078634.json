Though offensive powerhouse Tamino Kroeger is still out with an injury, Austin Derksen and Yannis Becker provided the offensive punch on Friday as the Skyhawks (9-4, 5-0 Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference) won their second match in a row, a 2-1 win at CSU-Pueblo. Elliot Chadderton had five saves in the win as CSU-Pueblo (5-6, 1-4 RMAC) outshot Fort Lewis 13-12. After a scoreless first half, Derksen put the Skyhawks ahead 1-0 with a goal in the 54th minute assisted by Becker. Twenty minutes later, Becker struck again, this time off his own foot with an unassisted goal in the 76th minute to give Fort Lewis and Chadderton a comfortable lead. It’s a good thing Becker’s insurance goal was netted as the ThunderWolves added a late one to get on the board. Mackenzie Paquette’s goal in the 87th minute prevented Chadderton from recording what would have been his sixth shutout. Fort Lewis’ tough back line and Chadderton wouldn’t allow the equalizer and the Skyhawks ended the road trip on a good note. After a week of much needed rest, Fort Lewis will welcome No. 13 Colorado School of Mines at 7 p.m. next Friday at Dirks Field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:18:51.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
