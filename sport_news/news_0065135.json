Then junior Helge Pietschmann netted both two goals in a 2-0 victory at Hodges Stadium. The stifling North Florida defense did not surrender a shot on goal over the full 90 minutes of action. Three of the 17 games have gone to overtime with the only tie coming in 2013. The Dolphins have three, three-game winning streaks in the series the that began in 1994. View From the Perch: North Florida will need to keep pace in its quest for the top seed in the upcoming Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament. Currently the Ospreys trail FGCU by a three points with two conference games remaining. The Eagles wrap up league play this weekend against USC Upstate in Spartanburg. The Ospreys close their conference schedule next weekend with the same Spartan squad at Hodges Stadium. Playoff Implications: A win for the Dolphins will guarantee them a spot in next month's tournament while a victory for the Ospreys will clinch a one of the top two seeds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:12:28.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
