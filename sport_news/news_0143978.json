Pic/AFP \nAli's fight with Frazier was a 14-round battle known as the \"Thrilla in Manila\". Ali earned his second victory over Frazier when the former champion didn't come out for the final round, and that fight is considered one of the greatest events in boxing and sports. \nAli, 73, is battling Parkinson's disease. He did not speak during the ceremony. \nThe Thrilla In Manila \nThrilla in Manila was the third and final boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. It was contested in 1975 for the Heavyweight Championship of the World at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines, on Wednesday, October 1. Ali won by technical knockout (TKO) after Frazier's chief second, Eddie Futch, conceded the fight prior to the 15th round. The contest's name is derived from the frequent rhyming boast made by Ali that the fight would be a \"killa and a thrilla and a chilla, when I get that gorilla in Manila.\" \nThe bout is consistently ranked as one of the best in the sport's history and was the culmination of a three-bout rivalry between the two fighters that Ali won 2-1. \nCheckout the full fight:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:32:15.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
