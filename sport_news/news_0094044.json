Grimes always loved to work.\nTending to his father's rice, cotton and soy fields was just fine for the young boy outside Clarendon, Arkansas. He played catch with his two brothers for fun, jogged five miles to football practices and was always unknowingly one-upping his friends. He worked hard. He played hard. He was your typical boy in the Arkansas Delta kicking dirt and tearing up his shoes.\nHe returns to his home state today as the most experienced coach on the Auburn totem pole -- his salary is the third-lowest on the team -- and he may very well be the most important figure for a program that prides itself on a strong running game built behind the pillars of the offensive line.\nHe's made this trip to Fayetteville dozens of times, but the 11 a.m. kickoff against Arkansas (2-4, 1-2) might mean more following a summer of heartbreak, health scares and thoughts of retirement.\nThe best way to know the man is to listen to the sage. His professorial talking points mixed with every-man soliloquies inspire his players and demand the attention of colleagues.\n\"I just don't know how many people have been through the things on different levels that I've been through, through junior high to Division II to I-AA to mid major to a place like Auburn,\" Grimes said this summer. \"I've had a good ride along the way and been able to win some football games and win some championships.\"\nHe's won seven conference championships at six schools, to be exact. He's also won five titles as a player.\n\"I'm kinda like Forrest Gump,\" said Grimes, with his infectious smile. \"I've worn lots of shoes.\"\nOne summer, the seventh grader arrived several weeks early for junior high football practice -- eighth graders got the head start on the grunt work while seventh graders were forced to wait until the start of the school year. Some thought of him as a brown-noser, but that wasn't Grimes' intent.\n\"That's the way he's lived his life -- his entire life,\" said Rush Harding, a friend and former quarterback.\nHe didn't make much money working as a sharecropper as a teennager, so he jumped on a barge on the Mississippi River and worked two summers without a break while making tugs and tows, cleaning the deck and doing \"the worst jobs\" from Memphis down to New Orleans, to Houston, the Mississippi Sound and even Panama City. \"It's kinda like the world's most dangerous job,\" said Carl Grimes, his oldest brother.\nJ.B. Grimes was 16 years old.\nHe never got sea legs, \"but I ate good,\" he said.\nYou see, this 5-foot-something, intense-looking youngster had a purpose in life. He didn't want to stay in Clarendon and plow the fields adjacent to the Cache River for the rest of his life.\n\"Very few people know it, but when he was 5 years old he said, 'I want to be a coach for the University of Arkansas,'\" Carl Grimes, 66, said. \"That's what his goal was.\"\nSo, Grimes played football. The 175-pound, short-framed player lined up at guard along the offensive line, wore the No. 62, played linebacker and \"had the face of Mike Singletary,\" a family friend said. He earned All-Conference honors, was the team captain and led nearly every organization on campus, it seemed. \"He just worked hard,\" said childhood friend Johnny Ellis, who still lives in Clarendon. \"If we ever lost a game, it crushed him. He cried. It broke his heart. He'd uplift us.\"\nThe farm taught Grimes lessons, too.\n\"Sometimes when you're growing up, instead of knowing what you want to do, sometimes it's knowing what you don't want to do,\" Grimes said. \"And I knew I didn't want to be on that farm any more. I knew I had to go and do something else, so I was encouraged. I had a reason to go get a college degree and I did that.\"\nHe enrolled at Henderson State, played four seasons as an undersized, 195-pound left guard, earned a scholarship and piled up 40 wins and a berth to the NAIA Championship Game in four seasons. More importantly, he earned his bachelor's degree in education, got his start in coaching at Nashville (Arkansas) High School and met his wife, Jennifer, in 1977. He plied his coaching trade while hitting the books. He later picked up a master's degree in education at Northeastern Louisiana as one of the top graduates in his class. Oh, and he won a national title there, too, as the offensive line coach in 1987.\nHe worked seven jobs in 12 years. That dream job at Arkansas a 5-year-old farm boy once privately heralded seemed like a distant memory. \"He had a rough start in coaching,\" said Ellis while riding a tractor in late October.\nFinally, he got the call to come home to Arkansas and coached for Ken Hatfield in 1989 and won a Southwest Conference title his first year at his dream job. They won 10 games, but Hatfield left for Clemson. Jack Crowe came in, produced a losing record and they were fired three years later. Grimes never returned to his dream job.\nStops at Virginia Tech, where he won two conference titles and needed a triple bypass surgery after complaining of chest pains during a game in 1997 followed, and so too did stints at Texas A&M, East Carolina, Mississippi State, Kansas and Arkansas State.\nHe caught a rare break from the profession in 2009 when Sylvester Croom was fired at MSU. Married 34 years and not one honeymoon or long break in between jobs, the Grimes family spent the year traveling and seeing the country together.\n\"We got to spend more time together that fall than we ever have,\" J.B. Grimes said. \"We figured, hey, we not only love each other, we like each other. We really had a blast.\"\nA stint at Kansas in 2010 didn't last long, but an opportunity to coach for Gus Malzahn at Arkansas State in 2012 provided another stop in his home state. He followed the coach to Auburn, where he led an offensive line that produced the SEC's first ever No. 1 rushing attack in the nation in 2013.\nHe underwent a medical procedure in the preseason of 2013, but recovered quickly for the start of the greatest turnaround in SEC history. Auburn won an SEC title and advance to the BCS Championship Game after winning only three games the previous year.\nThis past summer, however, provided more dire circumstances in Grimes' life.\nHis brother, Bill, made a pit stop outside Minneapolis following a trade show in Chicago to check out a nephew's organic farm. He walked around the property and started to feel tired. He found a place to rest.\n\"He sat down on the car,\" Carl Grimes said. \"And died.\"\nTheir Aunt Ruth, the last surviving sibling on their father's side of the family, died the same day: June 14, 2015.\nOne month later, J.B. Grimes was told he had a cancerous spot on his tongue and surgery to remove the spot and his lymph nodes was conducted July 29, six days before the start of Auburn's preseason camp.\n\"It felt like we were being dealt hard hands every time we turned around,\" Carl Grimes said.\nCancer-free J.B. Grimes wants players to 'count on me' Auburn offensive line coach J.B. Grimes discusses his quick rebound from cancer surgery and why he didn't want to miss practices after only six days removed from the major procedure to remove his lymph nodes and a spot on his tongue.\nJ.B. Grimes was nervous, and perhaps a little scared, he admitted, but he was ready to go under the knife. With bandages wrapped around his neck and staples protruding from his flesh like a recently-emerged experiment from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory, the coach jogged on the practice fields and coached his players less than one week following the major surgery.\n\"J.B. is probably the toughest coach in college football,\" Malzahn admired.\nGrimes was nominated earlier this week for the Football Writers Association of America's Courage Award.\nHis brother called to discuss the news earlier in the week. \"I'm still trying to find out the difference between courageous and stupid,\" J.B. Grimes joked, according to Carl.\nGrimes is cancer free, a few pounds lighter, but is as tenacious as ever. His brother Carl has been battling a form of leukemia for the last nine years. \"We're brothers from blood and we're brothers from cancer,\" Carl Grimes said this week. \"I knew what he was feeling and the emotional blow to the gut you get when somebody tells you that you've got cancer. It's almost a visceral kind of thing when they tell you that. Your stomach turns over. Your mind goes to the very worst things, but J.B. knew he had a battle and like anything else he's ever done, he was going to fight.\"\nStill stitched up in mid-August, Grimes admitted to feeling tired, but he was as wiry, happy and upbeat as ever while talking to reporters for one hour about his return to the field for his 37th season as a coach. He hasn't missed a single day of work since preseason camp began at Auburn in August.\n\"That's the way I was raised,\" he said. \"I didn't feel like getting on that tractor at 6 o'clock in the morning and going all day long or chopping cotton or whatever the heck I had to do, but I did it. It is what it is. You do your friggin' job and you don't bitch about it, you do it.\"\nWhat does the future hold for the Grimes family? Every day is a battle, but coaching is at the forefront for now. Carl Grimes, an Arkansas fan, will wear orange and navy blue, cheer the Tigers and his brother today inside Razorback Stadium.\n\"He loves Auburn,\" Carl Grimes said. \"I think he'll stay at Auburn as long as he can.\"\nMeanwhile, in Nashville, Arkansas a recently-constructed home on Lake Swampy Graves awaits J.B. and Jennifer Grimes. Whenever he wants to give up football and start duck hunting, their retirement home tucked outside the small town in southwest Arkansas awaits the couple.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:22:57.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
