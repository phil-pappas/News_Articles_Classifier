I had no intent to hurt him whatsoever,” said Utley, who had reached with a pinch-hit single. “Any time there’s a double play you should do your best to break it up.” \nThe Mets were leading 2-1 when the Dodgers put runners at the corners with one out against Noah Syndergaard. Bartolo Colon came on in his first career postseason relief appearance after 10 starts, and Howie Kendrick hit a grounder up the middle. \n“I tried to put a body on him to break up the double play,” Utley said of Tejada. “You have to try and break up the double play. That’s winning baseball.” \nMurphy flipped to Tejada, who took the throw awkwardly for an apparent force as Utley slid maybe a foot outside of the base and past the bag and slammed into the shortstop with Tejada’s back turned to the play. That caused Tejada to flip over as the tying run scored from third. \nMets infielder Kelly Johnson called it a “tackle.” Asked about the play, second baseman Daniel Murphy said, “Slide would be generous.” \n“Only Chase knows going in there what the intent was,” third baseman David Wright said. “I have a problem with the play on a number of different levels, one being the slide itself. In my opinion, he wasn’t anywhere close to the bag. With that being said, he never touched the bag. And I think the ‘neighborhood play’ is there to protect players. … It definitely seemed like after that play we lost the momentum and they came up with some big hits.” \nJoe Torre, MLB’s chief baseball officer, will examine the play to determine whether anything “excessive” occurred. \n“I’d hate to think that Utley tried to hurt somebody,” Torre said. “It certainly was late. That concerns me. The lateness of the slide.” \nTejada was put on a flatbed vehicle after an air cast was placed on his leg. The Mets said Tejada sustained a fractured right fibula. Utley was ruled safe on a video review, which determined Tejada’s foot missed the bag. Utley also appeared not to touch the base. \n“Tejada showed that he didn’t touch the bag and Utley never touched second base,” Torre said. “The fact that he was called out meant he’s not required to touch second base once he’s called out. So when the play was overturned, he gets awarded second base on that.” \nMets manager Terry Collins wouldn’t say whether he thought the slide was clean or not. He said the umpires were “great” in how they handled the review. \n“They thought that it’s pretty hard to rule that he didn’t touch the bag when he hit the shortstop and nobody was tagged, so they have no other call,” he said, “so they handled it right.” \nAdrian Gonzalez followed with a two-run double off Addison Reed and scored on Justin Turner’s double", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:43:54.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
