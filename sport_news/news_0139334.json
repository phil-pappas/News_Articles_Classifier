It has supplied more than 200 warships and 126 boats to the Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, marine police and various state governments. GSL is the largest exporter of ships from the country and is executing multiple orders for various countries. GSL’s chairman & managing director, Rear Adm (Retd) Shekhar Mital, NM, a veteran in shipbuilding, design and policy domain, in an interview with Huma Siddiqui, spells out the reasons behind the turnaround achieved by GSL in FY15. Excerpts:\nHow has been GSL’s financial performance in FY15?\nWe achieved a sharp turnaround with both top and bottom lines registering healthy growth. The registered Value of Production at Rs 569.55 crore rose 11.92% over the previous year’s Rs 508.90 crore. We earned PAT of Rs 78.24 crore, against a loss of Rs 61.09 crore in the previous year. We declared a dividend of 54% on the paid-up share capital of Rs 2,910 lakh as against ‘nil’ dividend in the last year and 20% in FY13. Earning per share also moved up manifold, from (-)R21 in FY14 to R27 in FY15; it was R5 in FY13.\nHow did you overcome losses?\nWe took the necessary correctives and realigned our strategy for the future. We differentiated our product profile/offerings with reference to other shipyards, leveraging strong inherent technical skills of our organisation, so that nascent private shipyards with limited expertise cannot enter the field easily.\nWe are working to bring in such products for which no capability exists with any shipyard in the country, be it a DPSU or private. Niche products identified for production at GSL are the ones which are listed as key priority systems for procurement by our armed forces. This, coupled with our track record of timely deliveries, provides us an enviable position in Indian shipbuilding industry. In December 2014, we signed an agreement with Griffon Hoverwork for hovercraft manufacturing. This agreement would help achieve the vision to make Goa a production hub for indigenous production of state-of-the-art hovercraft.\nWhat is your order book like?\nWe have been successful in bagging/concluding shipbuilding and general engineering orders, both at domestic and international levels. This will help arrest order book decline the company was facing for the last four years and will provide good traction for growth. As on March 31, 2015, the net value of outstanding orders amounted to Rs 2,380 crore. This includes half of the orders at Rs 1,200 crore from exports; the work on all of them started last year.\nFinancial negotiations for construction of OPVs for Coast Guard for about Rs 2,000 crore have been completed. The contract is likely to be concluded by the end of the year and construction on the project will start in the next financial year. GSL has been nominated to manufacture 12 Mine Countermeasure Vessels (MCMVs) indigenously with transfer of technology from foreign shipyards for the Indian Navy, amounting to Rs 32,600 crore.\nWhat about rating upgrade?\nIn terms of parameters laid down in the MoU signed with the government, we expect to be rated ‘excellent’ in performance for 2014-15, after achieving ‘good’ rating in the previous three financial years. This rating upgrade is a proof of the changes that have been introduced with surgical turnaround achieved in all divisions during the last financial year. The results indicate we have been taking strong corrective measures, focusing on execution, controlling our operating expenditure along with introducing accountability at all levels.\nWhat kind of corrective measures did you introduce?\nIn the shipbuilding division, constituting 82% of our revenues, the focus was on execution, supply-chain management which included timely placement of orders and receipt of material, improvement in productivity, connecting with people and easy accessibility to employees. Drastic cost-control measures were introduced company-wide.\nHow are you contributing towards ‘ Make in India ’?\nGSL is a leader amongst DPSUs in the field of adoption of high-end technology and the government trusts us to be a flag-bearer in the ‘Make in India’ initiative. The government has chosen us to manufacture MCMVs locally. This was in pursuance to our offer of building all the ships locally at GSL, against the government’s earlier decision and clearance of importing first two ships from abroad. This was probably the first case to be cleared under ‘Make in India’, where the technology is not available in the country. RFP for hovercraft for Indian Army is another such example, where, in a ‘global’ bid for heavier version of hovercraft, no company other than GSL has even ventured to submit the offer. Now, in order to enhance indigenisation in our ongoing projects, we have formulated and adopted policies on outsourcing, long-term procurement and vendor development.\nWhat is the progress on the MCMW front?\nThe nomination of the MCMV project to GSL by the Defence Acquisition Council in February is expected to spur high-end shipbuilding industry in the country. This nomination has provided good visibility to the order book of GSL. The project will start construction from mid-2018 and the last of the vessels will be delivered in 2026.\nFirst Published on October 08, 2015 12:23 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:25:00.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
