That alone, however, wasn't as much an issue in a 41-21 loss as a few missed opportunities in what was a close game until the fourth quarter. \n'We still have a lot to play for,' Cougars head coach Mike McDonald said. 'We have four games left and we get to have a say in it.' \nHeading into Friday's homecoming game against Campbell - with standout Jawan Nobles expecting to get a routine start at quarterback this week as usual - Newnan still controls an opportunity to host a first-round playoff game and quite possibly get itself back into contention for a Region 3- title. \nAfter two big divisional showdowns last Friday, Langston Hughes emerged as the region's only remaining unbeaten at 3-0, while Newnan, East Coweta and Westlake have all suffered its first losses in the 3- standings while all tied for second place at 2-1. \nIn order to keep pace this week against the Spartans, Newnan hopes to build on the success from its last outing at Drake Stadium where it put together 42 first-half points in a rout of Douglas County. \nMuch like Douglas County, Campbell (2-4, 0-3) enters this week in search of its first region win of the season. Since averaging 40 points over three non-region games, the Spartans have struggled on offense, managing just 26 combined in three straight losses to open the 3- schedule. \nNobles, a 6-3, 175-pound senior, remains a threat to breakthrough this week with 4.4 speed in the 40. He was last year's Cobb County champion in the 200 and anchored the Spartans' 400relay team, having verbally committed to play at Appalachian State where he plans to play receiver. \nSenior receiver Randy McClure (6-5, 195) - an equally talented basketball standout and the son of Campbell's longtime girls head coach - and senior running backs Hassan Graham and Kahj Huitt have big-play potential along with Nobles on offense, despite struggling in a 27-6 loss at Pebblebrook. \nThe Spartans, in their second year under head coach Ryan Brady, haven't posted a winning record since 2007 when they were led by current McEachern head coach Kyle Hockman. Campbell's lone score, a 48-yard touchdown throw from Nobles to Michael Lyons pulled the Spartans to within a 7-6 deficit in the first quarter. \n'Everybody in our region has good players,' McDonald said. 'They're no different. They've got a big noseguard and we're going to have to make sure we block him. They're going to come out and be ready to play just like we have to.' \nLast week's loss against Westlake had some of those qualities early. The Cougars took leads of 7-0 and 14-7 on a night where the offense racked up 269 yards rushing - 179 of which from senior Marquis Hill - and the defense held the Lions scoreless through one quarter. \n' We had some good moments, but just not enough of them,' McDonald said. 'I thought we executed pretty well in the first half. The second half weren't able to cash in a couple of times. We had a chance down on the goal line and had a chance to punch it in. They stayed patient and give them credit. They had a good game plan and they stuck with it.'
