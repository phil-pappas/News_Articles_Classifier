DeGrom did not have his best stuff in his last two outings, although he was able to beat the Dodgers and Cubs. Terry Collins called those two performances deGrom’s most impressive of the season, considering the way he battled through with the stakes enormous. But concerned about deGrom getting fatigued, the Mets are considering giving him some extra rest.\nWhen asked if Harvey, whose workload at one time threatened to blow up the Mets’ season, could pitch three times in the best-of-seven-games World Series, Collins seemed open to the idea.\n“There’s a possibility,” the manager said Friday after his team’s voluntary workout at Citi Field.\n© Provided by New York Daily News Back page of the Daily News for Oct. 18, 2015 - Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News Up to 202 innings this season, Harvey has already pitched the fifth most innings by a pitcher in his first season back from Tommy John surgery, behind only Jake Westbrook (202.2), Tommy John himself (207), Adam Wainwright (213.2) and John Lackey (215.1). He’s in line to jump to the top of that list with two World Series starts, let alone three.\nWhat’s more, when Lackey threw his 215 innings in 2013, pitching the Red Sox to the World Series, he had already reached the magical 200-inning mark in his career. That is the mark that clubs target before making innings limits disappear.\nThe most Harvey had pitched in his professional career was 178.1 in 2013 before he blew out his elbow that August. After his surgery, the Mets were cautious with Harvey’s rehab, preventing him from pitching in 2014. Still, in late August, Harvey’s agent, Scott Boras, charged that doctors said he should not pitch beyond 180 innings, claiming anything more than that would put the pitcher at risk of more arm trouble.\nAfter two weeks of uncertainty, shortened starts and tension between Harvey, Boras and the Mets, the 26-year old went to Collins and pitching coach Dan Warthen and told him he was in for whatever workload would get him and the Mets through the World Series.\nAnd now, the Mets seem ready to take him up on that offer.\n“The one thing we’re looking at with Jake is the last couple times out he looks like he could use some time,” Collins said of deGrom, who’s thrown 211 innings this season. “He’s been erratic with his fatigue.\n“Is it going to benefit us to start him and use him three times? Look, you gotta put them in situations where they’re going to have more success. I’m not sure where we’re going to go just yet, but I like our rotation no matter who’s out there.”\n© Provided by New York Daily News New York Mets practice at Citi Field, Queens, NY Friday October 23,, 2015. (Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News) - Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News The Mets do not have to set their rotation for a few days, and Collins did not say when he’ll make a decision.\nDeGrom has been the Mets’ only pitcher to have three starts in these playoffs. He clearly did not have his fastball command in the NLDS clincher against the Dodgers and then again in Game 3 against the Cubs, although in both outings he got stronger as the game rolled along.\nComparatively, Harvey, who has pitched twice in the playoffs, looked very sharp in Game 1 of the NLCS. If he goes in Game 1, he would have nine days’ rest between starts. The extra rest is something all of the Mets starters, except Steven Matz, could probably use, Collins said.\n“It’s helping them all,” Collins said. “The extra rest we’re gonna get right now I think is going to benefit us more than it’s gonna hurt us.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:24:53.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
