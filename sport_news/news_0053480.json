Comment Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 6:10 PM Updated at 6:13 PM Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 6:10 PM Updated at 6:13 PM Jerome Brabham ran for two scores and threw for another and Kinsey Williams rushed for 172 yards, including touchdown runs of 56 and 52 yards, as defending Section III champion Notre Dame clinched the Class C East title with a 42-6 win over Holland Patent in Saturday’s regular-season finale. Brabham, an all-state receiver who often lines up at quarterback, rushed for 60 yards on 10 carries, and his only pass was a 32-yard touchdown to Nick Sullivan. Sullivan finished with five receptions for 68 yards, and the senior safety also picked off two passes as state-ranked No. 10 Notre Dame (4-0, 6-1) won its sixth straight game. The Jugglers will host a Class C quarterfinal game next Friday or Saturday. Holland Patent (3-2, 5-2) has also qualified for postseason play. Section III playoff pairings will be announced Sunday. Check back later for much more on Notre Dame’s win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:13:38.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
