The current record is 115,109 at University of Michigan's stadium — the so-called “Big House” — when the Wolverines played Notre Dame Sept. 7, 2013.\nThe latest step toward making the half-mile racing facility workable for football occurred Wednesday with the announcement that a four-sided video board will be hung from cables above the speedway infield for races, football games and other events.\nBilled as the world’s largest permanent “center-hung” video display board and nicknamed Colossus, the board will be anchored by cables attached to four pylons outside the speedway exterior. It is similar to display boards used in basketball arenas. Each of the screens will be 30 feet tall and 63 feet wide.\nNext year’s Tennessee-Virginia matchup is not expected to be the final football game at BMS. Marcus Smith, president of Speedway Motorsports, Inc., the company that owns the track, said he expects the excitement generated by the game and the facility’s ability to host huge crowds will attract other major sports and entertainment events, including concerts by major names.\n“I want it to happen,” said Smith of other events at the track. “I think other universities are going to want it to happen because this will be the preeminent venue to play a game. It will break every record. This venue will be renowned as the single greatest sporting venue in the world.\n“I wouldn’t be surprised to see the biggest soccer game in the world played here. We really are transforming what Bristol Motor Speedway is today.”\nWork has begun on the video display, and it is expected to be in place for the speedway’s spring NASCAR weekend in 2016.\nThe Bristol track’s 2016 late-summer NASCAR race weekend will be held in mid-to-late August (the schedule has not been finalized), so work crews will have a small window in which to transform the speedway from a racing facility into a football stadium.\nMost of the infield will be cleared, and the football playing surface — track officials said a decision between sod and artificial turf has not been reached — will be installed near the center. A racing scoring pylon currently stands in the middle of the infield, and it contains video screens. It is scheduled to be removed before the spring race, to be replaced by the new video display.\nThe track’s seating areas will be changed slightly to accommodate the football field, viewing angles and television requirements. Plans call for thousands of temporary seats to be added on the concrete racing surface for the football game. Seating capacity for races at the track is about 160,000.\nSpecifics of how the speedway will be transformed into a football facility have not been released. Bristol Motor Speedway executive vice president Jerry Caldwell said the track needs “about a 14-day window” to make the transformation. “Once the checkered flag falls on the August night race, it will be a 24-7 project,” he said. “It will be choreographed down to the minute. We feel good about our timetable.”\nEach of the schools has been allotted 40,000 tickets. The speedway sold several thousand (the number was not released) last week, and thousands of others will be sold by the track in an online lottery. Track officials expect a sellout.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:28:59.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
