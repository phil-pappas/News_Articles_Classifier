(AP) - Florida State safety Trey Marshall has been ejected against Miami for a targeting penalty. \nMarshall, a sophomore for the 12th-ranked Seminoles, led with the crown of his helmet on a hit on quarterback Brad Kaaya in the first quarter Saturday night. Kaaya ended up completing a 14-yard pass to Braxton Barrios on the play. The play was reviewed and the call upheld. \nMarshall got the start after Nate Andrews injured an ankle last week in a victory at Wake Forest. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:08:24.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
