It's unclear if that gunshot was deliberate or an accident.\nThe alleged shooter then went to school, Tupelo Middle School, where he was taken into custody shortly after classes started.\nAuthorities say the teenager hid the gun on school property but the unloaded weapon was recovered.\nThe school district issued a statement, saying Tupelo Middle and nearby Pierce Street Elementary and the Fillmore Center were put on lockdown about 9:50 a.m. That order was lifted about 10:25 a.m. after the student was detained and the gun was found.\nInformation from: WCBI-TV, http://www.wcbi.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1iLQM81"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:18:20.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
