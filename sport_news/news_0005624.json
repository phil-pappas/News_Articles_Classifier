Next year, Orsillo will do select games on television and radio.\nIn Boston, Orsillo wasn't offered a new contract with NESN and is being replaced by Dave O'Brien. Orsillo first broadcast Red Sox games on NESN in 2001 and became the full-time play-by-play man in 2005 when the network acquired rights to all local telecasts.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:03:34.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
