Toms River South (4-2) had shut out three of its first five opponents.\n“Kyle is a great athlete,” sophomore quarterback A.J. Tolmachewich said. “He’s always around the ball, flying on every play.”\nExhibit A: With Jackson leading 7-0 late in the first quarter, Tolmachewich executed a nice play-action fake and hit an open Johnson in stride at Toms River South’s 20. The senior changed gears as he got under the ball and took it in from there.", "external_links": ["http://www.hudl.com/athlete/4032037/aj-tolmachewich", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/4518195/kyle-johnson", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3226749/dan-barker"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:06:27.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
