LOS ANGELES – An eight-season playoff drought ended at Dodger Stadium on Friday night, a moment made possible by a talented collection of overpowering arms.\nJacob deGrom, whose journey from a college shortstop to Mets ace has become legendary in Flushing, earned the honor among those arms to start this game.\nWhen he ended his outing after 121 pitches, deGrom had etched his name into the record books alongside Hall of Famer Tom Seaver. No longer was Carlos Beltran looking at strike three the last playoff moment for this franchise. DeGrom created a new memory.\nDeGrom fired seven shutout innings and outpitched Clayton Kershaw to lead the Mets to a 3-1 victory over the Dodgers, and a 1-0 series lead. DeGrom, in his playoff debut, tied the franchise playoff mark of Seaver with 13 strikeouts, and the Mets received a homer from Daniel Murphy and a two-run single from David Wright.\nNoah Syndergaard opposes Zack Greinke tonight and will attempt to give the Mets a 2-0 series lead.\nTyler Clippard allowed an RBI single to Adrian Gonzalez in the eighth before Jeurys Familia recorded the last four outs.\nDeGrom came out the gate showcasing his high-octane fastball, which sat at 97-98 mph in the first inning, and threw fastballs with 17 of his first 20 pitches. He struck out the side in the first, with all three batters swinging through 98 mph heat.\nFrom the second to fourth innings the Dodgers put a runner in scoring position, and twice it was due to a defensive blunder by Michael Cuddyer.\nIn the second, Cuddyer misplayed a long drive to left from Justin Turner, and the ball careened off his glove for a leadoff double.\nDeGrom escaped the jam by recording each of his next three outs via strikeouts, giving him six.\nIn the third, Cuddyer took a bad route on a fly ball to left by Corey Seager, and the ball dropped in for a two-out double. A strikeout once again erased the mishap.\nDeGrom held the Dodgers to a 0-for-6 showing with runners in scoring position through the first four innings, and thus lifted his pitch count to 80.\nNeeding quick innings to ensure he would remain in the game late, deGrom posted his first clean inning in the fifth with 11 pitches, and followed that with 10 in the sixth to preserve the Mets’ 1-0 lead.\nDeGrom threw a season-high 121 pitches, one short of his career-high set last May, and allowed five hits.\nAs he kept the Dodgers down, it gave the Mets’ batters time to try to capitalize on any mistake Kershaw might make, and they finally did in the fourth when Murphy connected on his second homer of the year against a southpaw.\nMurphy had just a .633 OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage) against lefties, and the lone homer came against Rays lefty reliever Jake McGee.\nHad Juan Uribe been on the NLDS roster instead of being sidelined with a chest contusion, there was the possibility that Murphy may not have been in the starting lineup for this game.\nIn a scoreless game, Murphy got ahead of Kershaw, 2-0, and pounced on a 94 mph fastball from the Dodgers ace and hit it deep into the Mets’ bullpen in right field for the game’s first run. Friday marked Murphy’s first career postseason game.\nAside from the homer, the Mets were unable to mount much early against the reigning Cy Young winner, but they grinded out at-bats in the seventh to expand their lead to 3-0, and knock Kershaw from the game.\nLucas Duda, Ruben Tejada and Curtis Granderson each walked to load the bases with two outs, and with Kershaw sitting at 114 pitches and Wright due up, he was pulled for righty Pedro Baez. Wright, the only Met who was part of the Mets’ last postseason team in 2006, stroked a two-run single on a 3-2 pitch to give the Mets the 3-0 lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:37:22.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
