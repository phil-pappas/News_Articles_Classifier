(AP) - So far, Daniel Murphy has invited many of baseball's top aces to his October bash - Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke and Jake Arrieta among them.\nNow, the Kansas City Royals are planning to spoil his playoff party.\nMurphy has homered in a record six straight postseason games for the New York Mets. He'll take aim at Edinson Volquez and the Royals starting Tuesday night in the World Series opener.\nMurphy hit a career-best 14 home runs during the regular season, then launched seven more in the first two rounds against the Dodgers and Cubs. He is one away from matching the mark for most homers in a single postseason shared by Barry Bonds, Carlos Beltran and Nelson Cruz.\nBefore a workout Monday at Kauffman Stadium, Royals pitching coach Dave Eiland said Murphy is getting good pitches to hit and isn't missing them.\nEiland added that Murphy looks \"very comfortable in the batter's box - and I'll leave it at that.\"\nCopyright 2015 All rights reserved.
