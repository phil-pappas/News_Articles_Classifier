(AP) — Joey Logano kept peeking around Matt Kenseth as the laps ticked away at Kansas Speedway, the two of them in entirely different situations in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. \nLogano had nothing to lose. Kenseth had just about everything. \nSo when Logano got under Kenseth entering Turn 1 with about five laps remaining, and sent him spinning across the track, it left many eyebrows raised long after the Penske Racing driver pulled away on the final restart to win his second straight Chase race. \n“That’s good, hard racing,” Logano said. “We were racing each other really hard. I felt like I got fenced twice. He raced me hard so I raced him back.” \nLogano was already guaranteed his spot in the next round of the Chase after his victory at Charlotte, though. \nAfter a disastrous race a week ago, Kenseth’s team arrived at Kansas knowing a victory this weekend or next weekend at unpredictable Talladega might be the only way he could make it to the final eight in the “eliminator” round of the playoffs. \nThat’s why Kenseth was doing everything possible to block Logano. \n“I’m really disappointed,” Kenseth said. “I was running the lane he wanted to run in, but my goodness, isn’t this racing? Strategically, I think it wasn’t the smartest move on his part. \n“He’ll probably sleep good tonight. I hope he enjoys that one. It’s not what I would have done.” \nKenseth wound up leading a race-high 153 laps, but his wild ride with a handful to go dropped him to 14th in the race and, more importantly, last among the 12 drivers in the title race. \nAlready eliminated from contention, Jimmie Johnson had a strong car all day and wound up behind Hamlin in third. Kasey Kahne was fourth, followed by Chase drivers Kyle Busch and Kurt Busch. Ryan Blaney was seventh, followed by more title contenders in Carl Edwards, pole sitter Brad Keselowski, Jeff Gordon and Ryan Newman. \nHamlin’s second-place finish allowed him to climb to second in the standings, giving him the best chance of everybody outside of Logano of moving onto the next round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:17:16.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
