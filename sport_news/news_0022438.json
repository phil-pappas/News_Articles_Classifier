From a crusader of farmer rights as the national president of the BJP’s Kisan Morcha and a strong votary of the implementation of the Swaminanthan Commission report, he has moved to being a minister who has unceremoniously dumped that identity and, now, sings a different tune. Dhankar, the minister, made his first U-turn when he announced that the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report was the prerogative of the Centre and the state government could do little. He had surprised everybody because as the Kisan Morcha president he had organised numerous protests and marches to press for the report’s implementation. In the Opposition, as the morcha president, it was easy to criticise the government, while as a minister, it was easy to pass the buck. Convenience mattered and what appealed in theory did not seem practical when in power. That’s probably why, during the last year, he went from one crisis to another. Urea shortage led to outrage in the state. Farmers waiting in long queues got urea from police stations and the minister, however, claimed there was no shortage. Farmers suffered a double whammy when wheat crop was damaged because of unseasonal rain and hail, leading to farmer suicides. To add insult to injury and undo the gain the Manohar Lal Khattar government could have got from quick release of Rs 1,100 crore as relief, Dhankar, once again, earned the farmers’ wrath when he said “farmers who commit suicide are cowards”. That wasn’t all. While distributing compensation cheques to farmers, he again blundered. Dhankar said the amount being given urged him “made him want to dance”. The insensitivity antagonised the farmers who were reeling under debts from successive failed crops. Dhankar has little to showcase as the Agriculture Minister other than his controversial statements which raised the hackles of farmers and the Opposition alike. As the Animal Husbandry Minister, his one “big achievement” has been the passage of the cow protection Bill in the Assembly. The Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Bill paved the way for prohibiting the slaughter of cows and its progeny, and providing punishment of up to 10 years in jail with a fine ranging from Rs 30,000 to Rs 1 lakh for any violation. In his first year as minister, Dhankar has ensured the protection of cows while farmers, to whom he owes his identity to, await their due.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:06:14.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
