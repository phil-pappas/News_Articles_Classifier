While Rob Gronkowski has labeled him a 'freak,' Matthew Slater says the third-year linebacker has been ''gifted.'' Comment Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 3:52 AM Updated at 3:55 AM Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 3:52 AM Updated at 3:55 AM FOXBORO – In retrospect, it really should have come as no surprise when third-year linebacker Jamie Collins emerged for the Patriots’ 2015 season opener wearing the green dot on his helmet signifying he’d been given the defensive play-calling responsibilities for that game. After all, Bill Belichick had given him the green light a month before. “I think definitely Jamie has got good leadership, good work ethic, and he’s really a part of everything we do defensively,” the Patriots head coach said back during the preseason. “He’s such a versatile player. “He’s in on every different package that we have; every personnel group. He’s a versatile player and a smart player. … Skill-wise, (he’s) really good and he does a lot of things well.” According to one of his teammates, skill-wise, Collins is simply blessed. “God has gifted that young man, there’s no doubt about that,” special teams captain Matthew Slater said. “As you play in the NFL, you get used to seeing some great athletes, but guys like Jamie kind of jump out at you even amongst the cream of the crop.” According to another of his teammates, Collins is a flat-out phenom. “He’s a freak,” tight end Rob Gronkowski said earlier this year. “He’s fast, he’s long and he’s strong, and he plays the game of football how it should be (played). He knows how to hit. He knows how to cover. He’s an overall good player.” Granted, there’s only so much one young man can do, but it’s still rather surprising to think that Collins arrived in New England as a second-round draft choice in 2013 coming off a season in which he was a member of a team that went 0-12 and allowed 37.9 points per game. Such was life, though, with the 2012 Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles, a team that was torched for 40, 42 (twice), 44, 49 and 59 points in games that year. Even in his rookie season in New England, Collins offered a preview of coming attractions, recording six tackles, the first sack of his career and his first interception (returning it 20 yards) in the Patriots’ 43-22 AFC divisional playoff win over the Indianapolis Colts at Gillette Stadium. Starting all 15 regular-season games in which he appeared a year ago, Collins eclipsed the century mark with a team-leading 109 tackles and complemented that with four sacks, four forced fumbles, three passes defensed, two interceptions and two fumble recoveries. He went on to post a team-leading 23 tackles in the Patriots’ run to a Super Bowl title, complementing that with three passes defensed and his second postseason interception of Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, one he returned 25 yards. Page 2 of 2 - Just three games into this season, he’s already had a double-digit tackle performance, registering 11 stops, three quarterback hits, 2.5 sacks and a forced fumble in the Patriots’ 40-32 victory at Buffalo in Week Two. “He’s probably one of the most gifted guys we’ve had around here, but at the same time he’s a great football player,” said Slater. “He makes plays on the football field and he does it at a high level.” “Jamie’s a pretty special player,” Patriots defensive end Rob Ninkovich said. “(He’s) definitely very smart, very physical, very athletic. He’s a younger player and the more experience that he has on the field, the more playing time he gets, the better he’s going to be. “Your rookie year you come and get your feet wet trying to learn the system. The second year, you progress. The third, fourth year you’re still learning, still trying to be a better football player, but just the game experience and everything helps you as far as seeing things and adjusting. So Jamie’s definitely a great teammate and I’m happy to line up with that guy next to me.” Far better to line up with him, says a teammate, than against him. “He’s one of those guys,” said Slater, “that you look at and you say, ‘I’m glad he’s on my team.’ We’re fortunate to have a guy like that in the middle of our defense.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:55:52.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
