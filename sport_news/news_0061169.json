Kelly-USA TODAY Sports) 15 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe University of South Carolina's Steve Spurrier and Clemson University’s Dabo Swinney are among the Top 30 highest-paid coaches in college football, according to figures compiled by USA Today and released Thursday. \nAlthough his team is ranked in the Top 10 in both major polls, Swinney is ranked outside the Top 25 in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision in salary. Conversely, although Spurrier’s team is stuck in the bottom of the Southeastern Conference, Spurrier's salary is ranked in the Top 15. \nSpurrier will earn $4,028,600 in total compensation this season before bonuses. Spurrier is ranked seventh among the 13 SEC coaches included in the compilation. Figures for Vanderbilt, a private school, were not reported. \nSEC coaches accounted for 10 of the Top 20 salaries. Sixteen coaches will earn at least $4 million this year. Eight are from SEC schools. Alabama’s Nick Saban leads all coaches with a total salary of $7.09 million. \nSwinney will earn $3,305,200 this season, the second-highest salary among Atlantic Coast Conference coaches. He is ranked 26th among the 121 coaches included in the USA Today compilation, one spot ahead of the lowest-ranked SEC coach, Kentucky’s Mark Stoops ($3.26 million). \nHigh salaries carry a combination of pressure and promise. \nCarolina compiled 42 wins from 2010 to 2013 while Spurrier’s salary never exceeded $3.4 million. Spurrier’s salary increased 20.9 percent in 2014, but Carolina finished with a 7-6 record. His salary increased by merely $11,700 this year, but the Gamecocks have dropped their first three SEC games. Three of the five remaining league dates are against ranked teams. A program that recently contended for SEC East Division championships may struggle to earn a winning record. \nThe declining return on the rising investment has induced questions about Spurrier’s longevity and his ability to salvage his recent trend of success. Whether he steers a turnaround or departs during the dip, Spurrier's standing on the salary ledger exhibits the university’s commitment to the program and its ability to attract a reputable successor. \nSpurrier was ranked fourth in the SEC and 10th among all Division I coaches in 2014. He slipped to 15th overall this year. He was passed by five returning coaches: Florida State’s Jimbo Fisher ($5.15 million), Ole Miss’ Hugh Freeze ($4.31 million), Baylor’s Art Briles ($4.24 million), Georgia’s Mark Richt ($4.12 million) and Auburn’s Gus Malzahn ($4.10 million). \nCoaches of the 10 remaining ACC schools included in the compilation are ranked between 30th and 67th. Figures for Wake Forest and Pittsburgh were not included. \nAlthough the SEC and ACC share similar markets in the Southeast, the leagues vary in their marketability. \nThe SEC brokered a lucrative television rights agreement with ESPN, which includes the SEC Network. Joining that deal with payouts from bowl games and NCAA championships, the SEC reported revenues of $455.8 million last year. Each SEC member will receive $31.2 million from those revenues, according to the league. \nThe ACC also has a television deal with ESPN, although it has not advanced plans for its own network. The league announced record revenue distributions from last year at $22.1 million to each full member. \nFour Big Ten coaches are ranked among the Top 15 coaches, including Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh ($7,004,000) and Ohio State's Urban Meyer ($5,860,000), who are ranked second and third, respectively. \nThe figures for seven Division I schools were not reported. That included major programs Southern California and Brigham Young. Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly was included in the listing, but only his base salary, $1.19 million, was reported. 15 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1RwL1an TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:49:40.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
