They allowed a season-high 21 points in the first quarter alone and struggled on offense, too. \n\"We just couldn't get out of our own way, offensively,\" Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said. \"We'd put something together, we'd get a penalty, we'd get a drop, we'd get a missed assignment. So that's disappointing, obviously. It starts and ends with me.\" \nMichigan has shut out three straight opponents for the first time since 1980. \nThe Wolverines scored TDs on a kickoff return, interception and offense for the first time since 1991 at Boston College, according to STATS. \nWith a homecoming crowd already fired up, Chesson kept them buzzing when he raced across the field and up the sideline untouched for a score that seemed to stun the Wildcats. \nMichigan ran for scores on its first two possessions on Drake Johnson's 1-yard plunge and Jake Rudock's 2-yard scramble to make it 21-0 late in the first quarter. \nJourdan Lewis picked off a pass late in the second quarter and returned it 37 yards for a score. \n(1) Ohio State 49, Maryland 28: Cardale Jones threw two touchdown passes, J.T. Barrett scored three times and the top-ranked Buckeyes, who haven't met enormous expectations this season, pulled away in the second half for a victory over the visiting Terrapins. \nEzekiel Elliott had two touchdowns for the Buckeyes (6-0, 2-0), who were tied, 21-21, in the third quarter before shaking free of the Terrapins (2-4, 0-2) and extending the nation's longest winning streak to 19. Ohio State has won 26 straight regular-season conference games, but again struggled against a huge underdog. \nOutscored, 73-6, the past two weeks, the Terrapins put up a fight amid speculation about coach Randy Edsall's future. \nAfter answering awkward questions about what could happen next, Edsall was asked why he would shake hands with all his players before what may have been his final game with the Terrapins. \n\"I do that every single game out of the respect I have for these kids and what they go through,\" he said. \"Every single game.\" \nEdsall then stormed off. \n(4) Michigan State 31, Rutgers 24: Freshman LJ Scott scored on a 3-yard run with 43 seconds to play and the Spartans (6-0, 2-0) won ugly for the second straight week with a victory over the Scarlet Knights (2-3, 0-2) in Piscataway, N.J. \nScott, who did not play in the first half, also scored on a 1-yard run to help the Spartans win their 10th straight game. They overcame an impressive return by suspended Rutgers senior receiver Leonte Carroo, who caught three touchdowns. \nConnor Cook ompleted 23 of 38 passes for a season-high 357 yards — one less than his career best — and two touchdowns. \n(22) Iowa 29, Illinois 20: Jordan Canzeri rushed for 256 yards on a school-record 43 carries and the host Hawkeyes held off the Fighting Illini. \nC.J. Beathard had 200 yards passing and two TD for the Hawkeyes (6-0, 2-0). \nCanzeri's 75-yard touchdown run put Iowa ahead, 23-13, late in the third quarter. Geronimo Allison pulled Illinois back within three on a 53-yard TD reception, but freshman Ke'Shawn Vaughn's fumble with 3:09 left doomed the Illini. \nWes Lunt threw for 317 yards and a touchdown for Illinois (4-2, 1-1). \nMinnesota 41, Purdue 13: Shannon Brooks ran for 176 yards and changed the game with a 71-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter and the Golden Gophers rolled past the host Boilermakers. \nBrooks had only 20 carries for 115 yards coming into Saturday's game. \nBut his long run on the second play of the second half got the FBS' second-worst scoring team started. Minnesota (4-2, 1-1) had 28 points in the quarter — more than it scored in any of its previous five games. \nPurdue (1-5, 0-2) has lost eight in a row in league play. \nPenn State 29, Indiana 7: Christian Hackenberg threw for 262 yards, two touchdown passes and ran for two more as the host Nittany Lions (5-1, 2-0) routed the Hoosiers (4-2, 1-2). © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
