Its first achievement on the gridiron remains its most notable — having played the first recognized collegiate game, against Princeton in 1869. Maryland has long been a middling program.\nMediocrity is one thing. But in their brief time in the Big Ten, Rutgers and Maryland have provided more embarrassment than achievement. Maryland has already fired its football coach. Randy Edsall was let go after the Terrapins lost to Ohio State two weeks ago.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts!\nJust as Edsall was leaving, Rutgers coach Kyle Flood was returning from a three-game suspension for initiating improper communication with a professor about a player’s grade. It was just the latest off-field issue for Rutgers, which had seven players arrested in a month span. Athletic director Julie Hermann has made misstep after misstep since her arrival.\nThe marriage of Rutgers and Maryland with the Big Ten was based on numbers and convenience. Both schools’ athletic programs were in financial duress. The Big Ten’s money was a needed salve.\nFor the conference — and its Big Ten Network — the addition of Rutgers and Maryland provided a geographical bounty, at least on paper. The New York/New Jersey and Washington/Baltimore media markets are two of the biggest in the country.\nBut Rutgers isn’t exactly the New York Yankees in terms of local interest, nor is Maryland the Washington Redskins.\nStill, Flood and interim Maryland coach Mike Locksley believe their schools’ jump to the Big Ten is — or will be — mutually beneficial. Flood pointed out that Rutgers has been to nine bowl games in 10 years.\n“We’ve had the success on the field as a football program that the conference would have liked to add, and the media market speaks for itself,” he said. “In this day and age, those things are important in the landscape of college football. I think we’re a perfect fit.”\nMaryland is pinning much of its hopes for improvement on an expected infusion of money from Under Armour, whose founder, Kevin Plank, played for the Terrapins. Call it Nike East.\nMaryland’s men’s basketball program is expected to compete for the national championship this season. As for football, Locksley preaches patience.\n“It takes time,” he said. “We came in last year and had some big wins in our first year. Right now, we’re off to a slow start. But through recruiting and increasing facilities and all those things that help your program, we feel we have the ability to at some point put ourselves in position where we can be consistently competitive in the league.”\nFor now, though, the Big Ten’s venture east hasn’t work out as hoped, especially with regard to Rutgers.\n“It might be a fun read that the Big Ten has remorse, but it’s somewhat irrelevant,” Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany told the Chicago Tribune a month ago. “I can’t name an institution during my (26-year) tenure that has not had a serious personnel or ethical issue at one point. I wish we never had any of it at our schools, but I’m realistic.”\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards\nHe said Rutgers’ advantages outweigh its problems.\n“What doesn’t change is the nature of the school, its aspirations and its geography,” Delany said. “Rutgers is not in Hawaii. It’s in the New Jersey/New York corridor. It’s a great research institution, home to many scholars, and has had graduation rates for athletics at or near the top for a decade. We hope the situation improves, but we are glad that Rutgers is in the Big Ten.”\nbrabinowitz@dispatch.com\n@brdispatch", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/buckeyextra"], "published": "2015-10-25T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:14:35.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
