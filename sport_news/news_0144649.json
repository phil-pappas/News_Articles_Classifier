Seattle avoided being swept in the final series of the season and finished at 76-86, 11 games worse than last season, when the Mariners were in playoff contention until the final day of the regular season. \nLogan Kensing (2-1) pitched 1 2-3 innings for the victory. and Tom Wilhelmsen struck out the side in the ninth for his 13th save, a night after blowing a save opportunity. \nPLAYER INJURED \nHigh school football player seriously injured in game \nSEATTLE (AP) - A football player from Evergreen High School was seriously injured in a game. \nHighline Public Schools spokeswoman Catherine Carbone Rogers tells The Seattle Times that the player injured in the game on Friday was taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle where he underwent surgery. \nRogers says the injury occurred at Highline Memorial Field in the fourth quarter. \nThe student's name, age and details of the injury haven't been released. \nSEAHAWKS-LYNCH \nSeahawks downgrade Lynch, Mebane to out for Monday \nSEATTLE (AP) - The Seattle Seahawks have downgraded running back Marshawn Lynch and defensive tackle Brandon Mebane to out for Monday night's game against the Detroit Lions. \nSeattle announced the changes in status following the team's walkthrough practice on Sunday. Lynch and Mebane had both been listed as questionable after Saturday's final practice. \nLynch injured his hamstring late in the first half of Seattle's 26-0 win over Chicago last Sunday. Lynch was hurt catching a fourth-down pass just before halftime. \nSeattle coach Pete Carroll said Lynch had an MRI on the injury earlier this week and the scan showed some \"findings\" but did not elaborate. It will be just the second game Lynch has missed since joining the Seahawks in 2010 and the first since the 2011 season. \nMebane suffered a groin injury against the Bears and did not practice all week. \nMLS-GALAXY-SOUNDERS \nBarrett scores in stoppage time, Sounders tie Galaxy 1-1 \nSEATTLE (AP) - Chad Barrett scored in the third minute of stoppage time to give the Seattle Sounders a 1-1 tie with the Los Angeles Galaxy in front of 56,097 fans Sunday night at CenturyLink Field. \nMarco Pappa started the play with a corner kick from the attacking right side. Sounders defender Brad Evans flicked it off his head across the goal, and Barrett, who came on in the 85th minute, ran onto the ball and one-timed it into the net from 2 yards away for his fifth of the year. \nThe Sounders (14-13-5, 47 points) extended their unbeaten streak to six games (4-0-2). \nLos Angeles (14-9-9, 51 points) clinched a playoff spot and climbed into a Supporters Shield tie with the New York Red Bulls. New York has four games left, and the Galaxy have two. \nIn the 36th minute, Robbie Keane converted a Seattle defensive giveaway into a goal. Seattle's Zach Scott, playing on the defensive left side, sent the ball toward Gonzalo Pineda at the top of the box. But he left it short, and Pineda couldn't reach it. \nKeane did, running onto the errant pass, taking it to the top of the penalty spot, and firing into the back right center for his 17th of the year. \nLIONS-INJURIES \nLevy, Robinson out for Lions against Seattle \nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) - Injured linebacker DeAndre Levy will not play for the Detroit Lions on Monday night at Seattle. \nThe team says Levy and tackle Corey Robinson did not make the trip. Levy was listed as doubtful Saturday with a hip injury, and Robinson was also doubtful with an ankle injury. \nDetroit running back Joique Bell (ankle) and tight end Brandon Pettigrew (hamstring) are also out.
