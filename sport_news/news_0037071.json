Both sides' qualification hopes were already over. \nGermany dominated from the off in Dublin with the home side living off scraps going forward. \nJerome Boateng headed over in the ninth, and only a desperate block from Irish defender John O'Shea prevented Ilkay Gundogan scoring four minutes later. \nRichard Keogh cut out Matthias Ginter's cross for the waiting Mario Goetze, who later went off with a groin injury that rules him out against Georgia. \nMesut Ozil thought he'd scored in the 19th but the goal was offside. \nJon Walters forced Neuer into action for the first time in the 24th. The Germany 'keeper had otherwise little to do. \nCounterpart Shay Given went off with a knee injury to be replaced by Randolph just before the break. \nIreland was much improved for the second half, when the German players seemed hassled by the home side's tenacious play. \nDaryl Murphy fired a warning shot in the 64th before Long finally found the breakthrough. \n\"When I came on, there were a few tired legs, and the gaffer (coach Martin O'Neill) said, just try test them in behind, put them under pressure, and luckily a ball came in for me and it was nice to finish it off,\" Long said. \"I know (Neuer) kinda plays out of his goal a bit, and I had to hit it early and hard to get it past him.\" \nGermany's best chances of the second half fell to Andre Schuerrle, who could only volley over from close range, and Thomas Mueller, who fired wide when he had all the time to pick his spot in the 78th \n\"When you get such a chance you have to take it. It's bitter for me and worse for the team,\" Mueller said. \nCiaran Fahey contributed from Berlin, Shawn Pogatchnik from Dublin. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:27:21.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
