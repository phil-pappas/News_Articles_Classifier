Donaldson removed for precautionary reasons after getting kneed in the head. Being evaluated now. \n— Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) October 8, 2015 \nThe good news for the Blue Jays, who also saw fellow slugger Jose Bautista leave in the ninth inning with hamstring tightness, is that Donaldson passed concussion tests, and both he and Bautista are expected to be good to go for Game 2 on Friday. Donaldson passed concussion tests. Will be monitored, expected to be fine. Bautista rt hamstring tightness. Mild. Expected to play tomorrow. \n— Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) October 8, 2015 \nAmidst the modern-day Murderer’s Row that is the Blue Jays’ offense, Donaldson could be the most murderous one of all. He clubbed 41 home runs and 123 RBIs during the regular season on a slash line of .297/.371/.568 while playing Gold Glove-level defense at third base. Donaldson could wind up taking home the MVP award after the season (though one Mike Trout probably has something to say about that), and his health is arguably the most important factor for Toronto as they chase their first World Series title in over two decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:17:04.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
