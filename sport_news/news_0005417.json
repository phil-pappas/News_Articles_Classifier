Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Baltimore Sun Media Group The defense held up its end against Penn State, but the Terps offense couldn't score in the 4th quarter. \nPerry Hills stared straight ahead with a black Maryland baseball cap pulled over his eyes in a brightly-lit interview room deep inside M&T Bank Stadium. A question that had dogged Maryland for the past month-and-a-half or so had come up again, this time in a 31-30 loss to Penn State. \nAfter four straight losses, how can the Terps (2-5) put together a complete performance and finish a game to earn a victory? \n\"We just got to take it to heart and just hate to have this feeling in your chest and build from it and go back and prepare like you've never prepared before, because there's still a lot of games left and you can't let this affect you,\" Hills said. \"You just got to go from it.\" \nDespite another defeat, there were some reasons for optimism. In each of the past four losses, the Terps have gotten more competitive deeper into the game. West Virginia blew Maryland off the ball in a 45-6 defeat on Sept. 26. In the next two games against No. 15 Michigan and No. 1 Ohio State, the Terps were competitive into the third quarter before the Wolverines and Buckeyes pulled away in the second half for sizable victories. \nOn Saturday, Maryland pulled to within one on a field goal by kicker Brad Craddock with 10:15 remaining in the game. The Terps had four possessions to take the lead but managed two fumbles, an interception and a turnover on downs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:20:37.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
