Sophomore outside hitter Mikaela Hopkins had a team-high 20 kills on a .260 hit efficiency in the match. Andra Havig returned from injury to hit .294 with six kills. The Crusaders entered the match after losing at home to Baker last Thursday. Determined to regain their top spot in the league, they played improved volleyball against an equally improving Tigers squad. \"The girls had to mentally put last week behind us,\" said ICS head coach Todd Hopkins. \"Lee Vining came out just putting the ball in play, and missing serves killed our opportunities in the first and second games. But [the Crusaders] rallied to start putting the ball down and not rely on other teamsâ€™ mistakes.\" On defense, Bethany Jennings had 32 digs, and Emily Hunsaker (15), Mikaela Hopkins (13) and Megan Steimer (12) contributed with double-digit performances. Serving-wise, the team tallied 18 aces, with Lindsey Miller (five) leading the pack. The Crusaders will return home on Saturday morning to face Big Pine (opening serve is at 10 a.m.), before hosting rival Trona on Monday. \"Our girls have fight, and all we need to do is compete like tonight regardless of the opponent,\" Todd Hopkins said. \"I'm proud of the all-around team effort.\" By Christopher Livingston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:08:21.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
