Employers in the world's biggest economy are expected to have added a healthy 206,000 jobs in September, resulting in the unemployment rate holding steady at 5.1 percent, according to analysts' forecasts. The numbers are taken into consideration by the Fed as it mulls raising interest rates from record low levels, with its next decision scheduled for Oct. 28. The following policy meeting is in December. However, there are worries a rate hike could also add to uncertainty in global financial markets as many countries struggle with slower than average economic growth.\nANALYST INSIGHT: \"We will spend today patiently waiting for the latest set of U.S. payrolls data, which may tell us how much longer we have to wait for the Fed to deliver a monetary policy tightening that most of the global economy is simply not ready for,\" Rabobank analyst Michael Every said in a commentary.\nWALL STREET: Major U.S. indexes ended little changed after a day of aimless trading.
