Ever.\" \nIndeed, the Illini begin 2015 without much experience in the backfield behind senior Josh Ferguson. Ferguson came into the years with 1,878 career rushing yards. \nThe rest of the runningbacks on the roster combined for 0. \nAdd in the fact that Ferguson is running a little more aggressively thus far in 2015, and the Illini knew they would need to find a reliable number two. \n\"Josh isn't running out of bounds,\" noted head coach Bill Cubit. \"Josh is getting positive yards and knocking it in there. You're going to take a little bit more of a pounding, but that's the Big Ten.\" \n\"And that's where Ke'Shawn really fits in.\" \nVaughn handed in an impressive relief appearance Saturday against Middle Tennessee. Amid reports that Ferguson was dinged up, Vaughn rushed for 80 yards on 13 carries -- a 6.2 average -- all in the 2nd half. \n\"He really changed,\" said junior QB Wes Lunt. \"I haven't seen him run like that since he's been here. He's done a really good job all year, but he really showed us what type of back he can be in the future, and what type of back he is.\" \nVaughn and the Illini open up Big Ten play Saturday, hosting Nebraska for a 2:30pm CT kickoff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:31:39.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
