For the last two CNC league championship meets, a single point was all that separated the Frontenac Raiders and the Girard Trojans with GHS coming out on top. This year, both squads finished even as both schools scoring 33, with the Raiders coming out on top with the tiebreaker. Alaina Purdon, Frontenac’s sixth runner, finished two places ahead of Girard’s fifth and sixth finishers in a time of 24:23 in 14th place to give the Raiders the CNC title. “For the last three years, it’s been close running against Girard,\" said Frontenac head coach Caryn Murray. “We’ve fallen short to them by one point in the last two league championships. This year, the goal at the start of the season was to comeback and redeem ourselves and today, these girls did that. That’s why when it came down to our number six runner, the coin fell on our side this time.” Running at Greenbush, the Raiders and the Trojans finished 55 points ahead of third place Baxter Springs while the Columbus Titans compiled 98 points. The Galena Bulldogs finished with 117 points. The Trojans may have finished runner up, but Cailie Logue continued her dominance by winning the race with a time of 18:20 for Girard. Her teammate, Layne Karhoff took second with a time of 20:34. “Frontenac’s pretty good,” said Girard head coach Matt Logue. “Our girls have worked hard and I know there’s little individual battles between the two of us and they won more of them than we did. If we want to survive them going into regionals we may have to win more than they do. We were not surprised that we would have a tough time against them. I was still pleased. We ran well and Frontenac ran well. That’s the way it is supposed to be.” Jessica Peterson for Frontenac was third in 21:11, while Racheal Stephens for the Trojans was fourth in 21:24. Frontenac’s Hannah Stover was fifth in a time of 21:35. Madi Hite and Madi Nighswonger were seventh and eighth, respectively in times of 22:11 and 22:21. “This was a huge accomplishment to come on top of such an awesome team,” Murray said. “It just shows how awesome southeast Kansas runners are. It’s an honor.” The Raiders and the Trojans will now turn their attention to regionals next week in Anderson County on Saturday, Oct. 24. “We’ve been waiting for this moment,” Murray said. “Now we’re trying to get our miles in early and now we’re doing well at the end of the races. Hopefully, we can do something at regionals.” Page 2 of 2 - Aubri Piccini of St. Mary’s Colgan was 10th in 23:47. For the Girard men, it wasn’t a matter of simply winning league, but coming away with a perfect score. The Trojans achieved that, scoring 15 points with their first-through-fifth runners placing in the top five. All seven of Girard’s varsity runners took All-League with a top-10 finish. Jon Zimmerman was first in a time of 16:48, while Laike Dammon was second in 17:02. Dalton Lindbloom and Ryan Hughes were third and fourth in times of 17:15 and 17:35. Kyler Newkirk took fifth to complete the Trojans’ perfect score with a time of 17:43. He gave the Trojans a perfect score by one second, beating out Brandon Moser of Frontenac who was sixth in 17:44. “We talked about that as the season wore on,” Logue said. “We knew getting a perfect score was a long shot with the Moser kid. We knew that Kyler would have a chance, but its exciting to accomplish this. Our 1-5 gap was good. Our number one runner was under 16 minutes. We’re trying to keep that going into regionals.” The Raiders took second with 69 points. Baxter Springs finished third with 95 points. Galena posted 104 and Southeast had 105 points. Garrison Wickerd was 14th in 19:31. Cale Franklin was 18th in a time of 20:43. Eian Monsour was 21st for the Raiders in 21:05 and Daniel Raio took 23rd in 21:09. Jett Gall was the number one runner for the Lancers, crossing the finish line at 27th in 21:54. He was followed by Jacob Burns in 28th and 21:55. Matthew Sanders and Liam Myers were 24th and 25th for the St. Mary’s Colgan Panthers in times of 21:26 and 21:39.
