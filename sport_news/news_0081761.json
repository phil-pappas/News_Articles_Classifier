Mark Humphrey AP (Associated Press) Comments \nNick Chubb is Georgia's biggest star, a standout sophomore running back and the clear centerpiece of the Bulldogs' offense. \nGreyson Lambert is Georgia's new quarterback, a Virginia transfer who has completed 33 of 35 passes with five touchdowns and no interceptions during the Bulldogs' last two games. \nHere are seven other Georgia players Alabama fans should be familiar with heading into the No. 13 Tide's matchup with the No. 8 Bulldogs Saturday in Athens (listed alphabetically): \nJunior outside linebacker Leonard Floyd \nCBS Sports ranks the 6-foot-3, 230-pound Floyd as the second-best outside linebacker prospect and 10 th -best overall prospect among players eligible for the 2016 NFL draft. \nFloyd's 23 tackles are tied for a team-high. He has 3.5 stops for a loss, two sacks, four quarterback hurries and two pass breakups. \nHe was named Georgia's team MVP last season after posting 55 tackles, 8.5 stops for a loss and six sacks. \nSenior inside linebacker Jake Ganus \nThe UAB transfer from Chelsea is sixth on the Bulldogs with 19 tackles and has an interception. \nGanus was a three-year starter at UAB. \nHe transferred to Georgia in December following the elimination of the Blazers' football program. \nSenior outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins \nCBS Sports projects Jenkins will be selected in the second round of next year's NFL draft. \nA four-year starter, the 6-foot-3, 255-pound Jenkins is tied for the team-lead with 23 tackles. \nHe has 6.5 tackles for a loss, three sacks and nine quarterback hurries. \nThe Georgia native recorded 11 tackles, 5.5 stops for a loss and two sacks during the Bulldogs' 31-14 win over Vanderbilt Sept. 12. \nSophomore wide receiver/returner Isaiah McKenzie \nThe 5-foot-8, 170-pound sophomore is likely one of the most dangerous returners in the country. \nHe had three returns for touchdowns as a freshman last season — two on punts and one kickoff. \nHe had a 77-yard punt return for a touchdown against Vanderbilt Sept. 12. \nMcKenzie has five catches for 89 yards as well as two carries for 32 yards. \nSophomore running back Sony Michel \nChubb and Michel form arguably the top running back tandem in the country. \nWhile Chubb has twice as many carries, the 5-foot-11, 210-pound Michel has rushed for 223 yards and four touchdowns on 32 attempts. \nHe is averaging 7.0 yards per carry. \nGeorgia also splits Michel out as a wide receiver. He has eight catches for 148 yards and three scores. \nMichel has at least one run or catch of 20 yards or longer in each of the Bulldogs' first four games. \nHe is posting an average of 92.75 total yards per game — combining rushing and receiving yards. \nSenior wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell \nAfter playing in just nine games in 2013 and 2014 due to injury, Mitchell has emerged as the clear top option in Georgia's passing game. \nThe 6-foot-1, 195-pound Mitchell has 20 catches for 306 yards and three touchdowns after catching 31 passes for just 248 yards and three scores in eight games last year. \nMitchell caught eight passes for 122 yards and a touchdown during the Bulldogs' 52-20 win over South Carolina Sept. 19. \nMitchell has nearly three times as many catches as any other Georgia wide receiver. \nFreshman Terry Godwin is second on the team among wide receivers with seven catches. \nJunior right guard Greg Pyke \nCBS Sports ranks the 6-foot-6, 315-pound Pyke as the second-best NFL prospect among junior offensive guards. \nPyke was a second-team All-SEC selection as a sophomore last season. \nThe Maryland native will be matched against an Alabama defensive line with two interior defensive linemen — A'Shawn Robinson and Jarran Reed — who are widely projected to be selected during the first two rounds of next year's NFL draft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:01:02.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
