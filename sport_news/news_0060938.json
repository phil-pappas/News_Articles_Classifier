Jones | Morris News Service ATLANTA – University of Georgia President Jere Morehead is asking the Board of Regents for permission to give an honorary degree to Ryan Seacrest, but the school refuses to provide any details in advance.\nSeacrest, the host of television shows like “Gladiators 2000,” “Keeping up with the Kardashians,” and “American Idol,” studied briefly at UGA but left for Hollywood at age 19.\nBut university officials won’t say why they’ve decided to recognize the Dunwoody native’s professional achievements.\n“We are delighted to present Ryan Seacrest to the Board of Regents as a candidate for this honor,” Morehead in a statement from his office to reporters. “Once the Board of Regents votes on this item, we will be happy to provide additional details.”\nThe request won committee approve Tuesday and comes before the full board today.\nNo one will say what the honor is or why he deserves it.\nStephanie Schupska, public relations coordinator for the UGA News Service, said, “That’s all they want to say right now.”\nGenerally, universities present honorary doctorates to people of outstanding professional or humanitarian accomplishments. Often, they are awarded during graduation ceremonies, and many schools use the awards as a way to lure prominent figures to serve as graduation speakers.\nThe university’s own website says, “the honorary degree is the highest recognition that the University of Georgia can bestow and is therefore not lightly given. It is intended to honor a person who has a sustained record of achievements of a lasting significance.”\nCriteria include “broad contributions to society … The prime and controlling consideration should be excellence.”\nSeacrest would join the ranks of former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, CNN founder Ted Turner and civil-rights attorney Vernon Jones.\nThe item is listed on the agenda for the regents two-day meeting that wraps up Wednesday at Kennesaw State University. Schools have to get the board’s approval to award honorary degrees, which is usually just a formality.\nThey are usually listed on the board’s agenda that is made public the Friday before every monthly meeting. In this case, the item was headlined “Honorary Degree Requests: Clayton State University.” Underneath is a sentence about degrees Clayton State seeks for Leonard Moreland and Marcia Taylor. The next sentence says Morehead seeks one for Seacrest.\nWhen and where it will be approved is also a secret.\nRegents meetings are intricately choreographed and timed to the minute. Power Point presentations are polished and rehearsed, and unscripted discussions are infrequent even during consideration of controversial matters, other than occasional friendly banter. So, university presidents tend to avoid making public information before they have presented to the board.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Ryan_Seacrest_2013.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Ryan_Seacrest_2013.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:13:30.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
