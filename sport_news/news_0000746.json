During the Badgers’ contract with Adidas, they received somewhere between $750,000-$800,000 each year in cash compensation. \nProduct contributions following the first year of the Under Armour deal would be worth between $2.45 million and $3.05 million annually. Adidas provided $1.375 million in product this season. \nSchools currently sponsored by Under Armour include Maryland, Auburn, Boston College, Northwestern, Notre Dame and South Carolina. \nUW’s contract with Adidas expires on June 30, 2016. \nAthletic director Barry Alvarez told the State Journal in April that he met with Under Armour representatives when the UW men’s basketball team played at Maryland in late February. \nAlvarez said in April that Under Armour wouldn’t be able to cover all of UW’s footwear needs right away — specifically mentioning volleyball and track and field — but various shoe lines are being developed. \n“They’ll allow you to purchase other shoes,” Alvarez said in April. He said Under Armour would prefer Adidas and Nike not be used as replacements, “but I think there would be some flexibility if there was a big drop-off on quality. We’ll figure that out if we get there.” \nThe contract also states that “Under Armour would acknowledge its plan of action with respect to human rights issues and allow UW access to archives and contemporary inspection and monitoring reports for all facilities producing goods for the university.” \nHere's the full list of principle provisions of the proposed agreement with Under Armour, according to the resolution that will be presented to the board: \n• UW-Madison would receive an annual product allotment of Under Armour shoes, apparel and equipment at no cost to UW-Madison, to outfit and equip its 23 intercollegiate teams. Under the existing contract, Athletics received an annual product allotment from Adidas totaling $1,300,000 in year one of the contract, increasing incrementally to $1,375,000 in the final year. Under the proposed Agreement with Under Armour, Athletics would receive $3,300,000 in product during the first year to account for the increased product needs associated with a change in Sponsors. Thereafter, Under Armour will provide Athletics with $2,450,000 in product for year two of the contract, increasing incrementally to $3,050,000 in year ten. \n• UW-Madison would receive an annual amount of cash compensation from Under Armour to provide income to Athletics. In addition, UW-Madison would be eligible to receive annual bonus compensation based on the overall performance of the university’s athletic teams. The amount of annual cash compensation made under the existing contract with Adidas varied from $750,000 in the first two years of the term to $800,000 in the last three years. Under the proposed Agreement with Under Armour, Athletics would receive an annual cash contribution of $4 million. \n• UW-Madison would receive an annual guaranteed minimum licensing royalty from Under Armour. Under the current agreement, Adidas pays UW-Madison an annual guaranteed minimum licensing royalty of $100,000. In the proposed agreement with Under Armour, that amount increases to $450,000. \n• The term of the Agreement would be ten (10) years. \n• In Contract Year #1 and Contract Year #2, Under Armour would pay UW-Madison up to $250,000 for total compensation of up to $500,000, to be allocated for the rebranding of University’s athletic facilities and build-out of team areas, including design work and installation. \n• In Contract Year #1, Under Armour would pay UW-Madison $150,000 to be allocated toward the rebranding and build-out of retail space in Bucky’s Locker Room for the placement of Under Armour products and promotional materials. \n• Under Armour would hire at least two University students per Contract Year to participate in Under Armour’s Summer Rookie internship program at Under Armour’s Baltimore Headquarters (“Rookie Program”). \n• Under Armour would become the exclusive supplier of accessories, apparel, equipment and footwear to UW-Madison’s 23 intercollegiate athletic teams and their coaches. \n• Under Armour would acquire the exclusive right to sell all authentic competition apparel worn by intercollegiate teams and coaches, all replica versions of authentic uniforms, and all performance products. \n• Under Armour would receive the exclusive right to the official designation of “Official Outfitter of University of Wisconsin-Madison Athletics,” as well as the “Official Outfitter” of the Teams. In addition, UW-Madison would provide other promotional opportunities and privileges including tickets, parking passes, signage, electronic scoreboard messaging, public address announcements, and website and social media recognition. \n• Under Armour would acknowledge its plan of action with respect to human rights issues and allow UW-Madison access to archives and contemporary inspection and monitoring reports for all facilities producing goods for the university.
