The Cardinals’ fans definitely have something to be proud, and they’ll be there to support their team like always. \nDollarway’s physical toughness has really been tested in their first five games of the 2015 season. The Cardinals have stood up to those tests, and they’ve proven that they can play a physical style if they need to. \nIt’s always good to be able to play multiple styles of football, because every opponent won’t play the same. The versatiltiy of the team will be key for them this week when they take on the Monticello Billies. \nThe Cardinals’ speed will play a big part in their approach to their game at 7 p.m. Friday night at home. Dollarway (4-1, 2-0 in 8-4A Conference) has enough weapons to utilize the entire field and play a spread style if neccessary. The running game has been huge for the Cardinals this season, and it continues to get better from week to week. Due to the success on the ground, the Cardinals have been able to maintain a well balanced attack. \n“I think our offense has had the balance that we’ve been looking for,” Dollarway head coach Cortez Lee said. “Lately the running game has gotten better, so we’ve been able to expand our play calls. The added advantage of our running game has allowed us to use some different offensive sets. One thing we’re working on doing is getting our guys out in space more.” \nThey’ll have a good opportunity to get their guys in space on Friday night, because that’s exactly how Monticello wants to play. The Billies (2-3, 0-2) run a spread offense, and they want to score a lot of points. Marty Davis is now in his second season as head coach, so they’re still working to perfect his system. \nThey return a nice amount of starters from last season as they have seven on offense and six on defense. Junior quarterback Jeff Carmical has been solid so far this season, as he has thrown seven touchdowns and two interceptions. Senior running back Dre Millet has gained 325 rushing yards through the first five games, and he can run between the tackles as well as on the perimeter. The Billies will stick to what they like to do, and it will be up to the Cardinals’ defense to slow them down. \n“I’m proud of our defense at this point,” Lee said. “We started our last game a little sluggish, and (DeWitt) ran it down our throats. Once we understood their blocking scheme and realized what they were doing it made things much easier for us.” \nDollarway has done a good job scouting the Billies this week during preparation. The Cardinals were able to watch film to get an idea of what Monticello likes to do. They feel like they’ve had a good week of practice, and now they just have to carry that over into the game. If the Cardinals come out playing with intensit, and a high energy level, then they’ll give themselves a good chance of claiming their fourth consecutive victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:10:41.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
