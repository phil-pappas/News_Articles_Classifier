Arsenal are definitely better than zero points from two games.” \nWith a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table already, Bayern is on course to become the first side to win four straight Bundesliga titles. \nArsenal, meanwhile, is fresh from beating Watford 3-0 away on Saturday in the Premier League thanks to three second-half goals. The victory moved the Gunners up to second, ahead of Manchester United on goal difference and two points behind leader Manchester City. United beat Everton 3-0 away while City thumped visiting Bournemouth 5-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:10:22.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
