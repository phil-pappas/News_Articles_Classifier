It was a far cry from a season ago when the injury-riddled Lobos had as few as eight healthy players practicing at times duringwhat became a painful losing season.\n“It’s nice to have a little depth to work with,” Neal admitted.\nSeason opener\nNov. 3: CSU-Pueblo at UNM (exhibition), 7 p.m., 770 AM Sixteen of those Lobo players we knew about. But the team made an unexpected announcement. Connor Joy, a senior who was a team manager last year and often asked to help serve as a practice body during those thin times when the Lobos were so injured, has been added as UNM’s fourth walk-on player, joining guards Tim Jacobs, Adam Cumber and forward Michael Nesbitt.\nJoy is a 6-foot-4 guard and 2011 graduate of Rehoboth Christian. He, guard Cullen Neal’s return from a medical redshirt season to a high ankle sprain, and transfers Elijah Brown (Butler) and Tim Williams (Samford) give UNM a lot more flexibility than a year ago.\nWalk-on Connor Joy lays up the shot during practice at the Davolas Center on Friday afternoon. (Jim Thompson/Albuquerque Journal.)\n“There’s a lot of things up for grabs,” Craig Neal said. “A lot of positions up for grabs. There’s nothing concrete for who’s going to start, what rotation I’m going to use. I think it’s going to be on the performance in practice. I do think we’ll be able to rest some guys with practice minutes (unlike last year).”\nThe Lobos are allowed 30 practices in a 42-day span before the regular season starts.\nAnd they feel they have plenty to prove once that happens.\n“We all have a bad taste in our mouths after last year,” said returning starting wing Sam Logwood. “… It motivates us a lot. It’s something that is heavy on our shoulders, what happened last year. Everyone felt it.”\nINJURIES: Cullen Neal was a full participant Friday and says he doesn’t even think about his injured ankle anymore. Logwood was held out of contact drills as he recovers from having a bone spur removed from high right ankle two months ago.\nWilliams was a full participant though the middle finger of his right hand was in a splint. He dropped a dumbbell on it last month and broke a bone at the tip of his finger.\nSenior forward J.J. N’Ganga, still nursing a recurring Achilles’ tendon injury, suited up but did not participate in Friday’s practice.\nSEASON TICKETS: Through the close of business on Wednesday, UNM had sold 9,901 men’s basketball season tickets for the season, or 376 fewer than at the same point a year ago. There were 9,217 season ticket renewals this year, down from 9,821 last year.\nWHO’S THE SHOOTER? Asked who the best shooter of the incoming freshmen recruits was, Craig Neal didn’t hesitate.\n“Anthony Mathis is our best shooter (of the incoming freshmen),” said the coach, then adding another layer of praise for the guard.\n“He might be the best shooter on the team. He can really shoot the ball. Now he’s got to learn to do some other things, but he can really shoot it.”\nWhen Cullen Neal, a past winner of the Lobos’ 3-point shootout at the Lobo Howl, heard what his dad/coach had to say of the rookie Lobo, the sophomore guard was almost surprised.\n“That’s disrespectful,” joked Cullen Neal, flashing a big smile. “I don’t think I’ve ever lost to Anthony in a shooting contest. But, yeah, all of us can really shoot the ball.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jt100215e-252x400.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:14:00.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
