The Raiders (2-6, 3-6) answered back with two goals in the second half before Sanchez’s goal. \n“We pretty much dominated most of the game,” Lancers coach Victor Polanco said. “But you can dominate for 70 minutes and let up for 10 and then give up some goals. \n“That can be scary.” \n\nOakdale 4, Manteca 1 \nAron Navarrette got the Buffaloes (2-6-1, 5-9-1) on the board just before halftime with an unassisted goal to come within 2-1, but the Mustangs (6-0-2, 13-2-4) added two more second-half goals to pull away. \n“We had opportunities in the second half,” Manteca coach Justin Coenenberg said. “Their goalie just got hand on a one-on-one could have tied it at 2-2,” \nOakdale had 25 shots to eight for the Buffaloes. Manteca goalie Matsua Garcia-Mendez had 17 saves. \n\nWeston Ranch 9, Kimball 0 \nAriel Silva had three goals for the Cougars and Gio Rodriguez had two. \nAndy Cadis, Mario Martinez, Jesus Espinosa and Issac Espeiono added one goal each for Weston Ranch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:01:24.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
