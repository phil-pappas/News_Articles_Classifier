They talked about the loss of Altee Tenpenny, the former Alabama running back with the big smile who died Tuesday in a one-car accident . Kamara, Henry and Drake all donated to a charity website raising money for Tenpenny's funeral costs , according to GoFundMe. \n\"After the game, those guys all kind of came up to me and said we were all playing for Altee and Altee was with us all,\" Kamara told reporters. \"Win or lose, I know Altee was looking out for us.\" \nKamara, Henry and Tenpenny were part of Alabama's highly-regarded running back recruiting class in 2013. Kamara left after his freshman season, spent a year at Hutchinson Community College in Kansas and then landed at Tennessee. In Knoxville, Kamara has provided a veteran voice on a talented, but young team and has paired nicely with Jalen Hurd. \nFor Kamara's first trip back to Bryant-Denny Stadium on Saturday, he was picked as one of Tennessee's three team captains. He tried to downplay what the return to Tuscaloosa meant in the days leading up to the game, but he appreciated being a team captain against his former team. \n\"It meant a lot,\" he said. \"Just how much this game kind of meant, being able to walk out there as a captain for my team was great.\" \nKamara was effective against his former team in the 19-14 loss, especially in the passing game. The junior running back finished with four catches for 44 yards, plus 21 rushing yards on five carries. He admitted after the game there was \"extra juice\" to get a win against the Crimson Tide. \nAlabama head coach Nick Saban was impressed with how Tennessee utilized Kamara in the second half. \n\"The thing they hurt us on in the second half was putting Alvin in empty and rocket motion him,\" Saban said. \"They hit a couple big plays on the rocket motion passes. We were really trying to keep the edges all the time and it gives you single coverage outside and they hit a couple plays on us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:53:55.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
