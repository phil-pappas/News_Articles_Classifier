The other was Oklahoma in 2008.\n\"We just erased last year and tried to make a statement for this year,\" Baylor cornerback Ryan Reid said.\nBaylor coach Art Briles harped on his team's losing record in three previous games with the Mountaineers.\n\"We felt a lot of desire, a lot of need to clear our name,\" Briles said. \"We didn't feel like we had a good name in West Virginia, so that was kind of our motivation.\"\nAny perceived slights were wiped out during an impressive start to the second half. Baylor erupted for touchdowns on consecutive drives of 82, 75, 52 and 60 yards to build on a 27-17 halftime lead.\nAnd if the wonks who gauge style points tuned out late in the game, the Bears had the ball at the WVU 1 in the final seconds before electing to take a knee on the game's final play.\nThe victory enabled the No. 2 Bears (6-0, 3-0), to become bowl eligible for the sixth straight season and prove a point to skeptics who might have wondered if their offense could keep humming against one of the Big 12's best defenses.\n\"It had nothing to do with rankings or getting bowl-eligible, nothing to do with anything other than when people talk about us up there, we want them saying good things about our football program,\" Briles said. \"We didn't feel like we had earned the right up until today. So maybe now, they'll say Baylor's got a decent team.\"\nThe No. 2 Bears (6-0, 3-0) extended their nation-best home winning streak to 19 games.\n\"We've got a point to prove every time we step on the field and especially at home,\" Baylor wide receiver Corey Coleman. \"We just have to put our foot down and be at our best.\"\nColeman might have lived up to that claim more than anybody Saturday with 10 catches for 199 yards. His three receiving touchdowns boosted him past Kendall Wright's previous single-season record of 14 touchdown grabs. Coleman now has 16 TDs in six games.\n\"It's crazy,\" Baylor wide receiver Jay Lee said. \"He's on pace to go for like 32 right now. One missed tackle or one missed play we're going to get you. He's doing an incredible job and we all are as a receiving corps.\"\nWest Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen came away impressed after his defensive backs were repeatedly burned by the speedy Coleman.\n\"You can put me on record,\" Holgorsen said. \"Corey Coleman is the best player in college football.\"\nColeman received a lot of help from an offense that rolled up 693 yards and 8.2 yards per snap against a defense for West Virginia (3-3, 0-3) that allowed only 23 points in its first three games.\nSeth Russell became only the second player in Baylor history with 300 yards passing and 100 rushing yards in the same game after passing for 380 yards and five touchdowns and adding a career-best 160 rushing yards and another score. He has accounted for at least three touchdowns in each of his seven starts.\n\"Man, I'm having a hard time finding faults, I really am,\" Briles said about his junior quarterback. \"He's pretty complete, and I'm talking about mentally and as a teammate and everything else.\"\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 6 NEXT SLIDE > Baylor running back Shock Linwood, right, scores past West Virginia safety Dravon Askew-Henry, left, in the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Oct 17, 2015, in Waco, Texas.
