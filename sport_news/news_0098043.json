We supported Heather Rabbatts' strong statement on the matter earlier in the month.\n\"Personally I don't think Mr Mourinho comes well out of the whole saga -- he clearly made a mistake in the heat of a game, and should have said so and apologised.\n\"Instead he has said very little and Miss Carneiro has lost her job.\n\"Our regulatory team have investigated this and whilst Mr Mourinho has breached no rules it was clearly a failure of his personal judgement and public behaviour. This should be seen as such by the game.\"\nMourinho was cleared by the FA on Wednesday of making discriminatory comments towards Carneiro, but it has emerged that the FA made no attempt to interview Carneiro or even ask for a witness statement, much to Rabbatts' frustration.\n\"The FA's reaction to the treatment of Dr Eva Carneiro has been seriously disappointing,\" Rabbatts said.\n\"I have major concerns over the way in which the disciplinary process has been conducted and the lack of an organisational response to the wider issues raised by this case.\n\"We had an announcement late yesterday relating to a high-profile incident which occurred on August 8 and yet it would appear that during that time no witnesses were requested to speak to the FA, including Dr Carneiro, and in the course of the investigation some media were reporting it was likely that no charge was to be brought.\n\"This is on top of a previous case when clear evidence of sexist and abusive chanting from groups of supporters against Dr Carneiro was apparently not seen as sufficient for a charge to be raised.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:43:32.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
