I really wanted to make a statement. But we’ll face them again in the Pac-12 championship game.”\nRosen’s declaration could have been deemed youthful optimism or wishful thinking given the Bruins’ recent slide.\nWeeks earlier, a blowout win over then-No.16 Arizona catapulted Rosen and the Bruins to No.7 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll, equaling the highest ranking for the program since 2001.\nEven in a crowded, competitive South Division, UCLA looked like a favorite to make its third trip in five seasons to the Pac-12 championship game.\nBut early October remains an unwelcomed sight in Coach Jim Mora’s three-plus seasons.\nUCLA lost to unranked Arizona State, a double-digit underdog, 38-23, in a game it never led on Oct.3 at the Rose Bowl.\nThen came last week’s crushing 56-35 loss at Stanford, its eighth in a row to the Cardinal, with the past five coming under Mora.\nFor the third straight season, UCLA finished September without a blemish only to drop back-to-back games in October.\nLast season, the Bruins responded by winning five straight, nearly winning the division before a loss to Stanford in the regular-season finale.\n“You don’t panic,” Mora said. “We’ve learned that.”\nFor the most part, they have always responded under Mora, losing three straight just once since 2012.\n“We don’t like to change anything,” receiver Jordan Payton said this week. “We just like to get to the problems, focus on the problems and fix the problems.”\nThe next chance for the Bruins (4-2 overall, 1-2 in the Pac-12) to show things are “fixed” is Thursday night at the Rose Bowl, against No.20 Cal (5-1, 2-1), which features talented quarterback Jared Goff running third-year coach Sonny Dykes’ “Bear Raid” pass-heavy offense.\n“Stanford was like old-school football,” Mora said. “Cal’s like new-school football.”\nTo get back on track, the Bruins must shore up their injury-plagued defense, which has allowed 124 points in its three conference games, all coming since the loss of star linebacker Myles Jack to season-ending surgery for a torn anterior meniscus. UCLA allowed more than 300 rushing yards in two of those games (Arizona and Stanford).\nThrough six games, UCLA is allowing an average of 216 rushing yards per game, which ranks last in the Pac-12 and 113th among 127 FBS programs.\nIn addition to Jack, defensive tackle Eddie Vanderdoes (knee) and cornerback Fabian Moreau (foot) have been lost for the season, but that only begins to tell part of the story.\n“Little things are killing us,” Payton said.\nStart with penalties and turnovers, which remain hangups despite a tough-minded coach who harps on consistency and discipline.\nUCLA has improved slightly in penalties since Mora’s first season, but still ranks 105th in the country. It’s averaging 7.8 penalties for 75 yards, including a season-high 10 for 93 yards last week against Stanford.\n1 2 Next Page Related: UCLA vs. No. 20 Cal: Who has the edge?
