Kemoko Turay scooped it up and scored on a 26-yard return to make it 52-39.\nRutgers then took advantage of both of Nate Sudfeld’s interceptions to tie the score at 52. Sudfeld was 32 of 42 for a career-high 464 yards, with four touchdowns for Indiana (4-3, 0-3), which lost its third straight.\n \nWisconsin 24, Purdue 7: Alec Ingold ran for two short scores, Joel Stave passed for 322 yards and host Wisconsin’s stifling defense held Purdue to a season-low 191 yards.\nThe Badgers (5-2, 2-1) overcame several penalties and other mistakes in the red zone to win on homecoming weekend at Camp Randall Stadium.\nWisconsin led just 10-7 late in the third quarter until the Badgers got two rushing touchdowns during an eight-minute span between the third and fourth quarters.\nT.J. Edwards then forced the Boilermakers’ Markell Jones to fumble at Purdue’s 43. Safety Tanner McEvoy pounced on the ball to seal the victory for the Badgers.\nEdwards, one of two freshmen starting at inside linebacker for Wisconsin, finished with 16 tackles.\nThe only score for Purdue (1-6, 0-3) came on David Blough’s 2-yard quarterback keeper in the second quarter.\n \nNebraska 48, Minnesota 25: Tommy Armstrong Jr. bounced back from two bad performances to start Big Ten play, passing for 261 yards and three touchdowns for visiting Nebraska.\nTerrell Newby rushed for 116 yards and two first-half scores on just 13 carries for the Cornhuskers (3-4, 1-2), who were reeling from four losses on the opponent’s final offensive play.\nThis one was a lot less stressful, though Mitch Leidner did his best to keep the Gophers (4-3, 1-2) competitive with career highs in completions (26) and yards (301).\nAlonzo Moore, Cethan Carter and De’Mornay Pierson-El were the touchdown targets for Armstrong, who completed only 36 percent of his passes for a total of 234 yards in losses to Illinois and Wisconsin during the previous two weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:04:38.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
