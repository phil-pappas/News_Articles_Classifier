Servais replaces Lloyd McClendon, who was let go earlier this month. \nThe 48-year-old doesn't have any managerial experience. He worked the past five seasons as an assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Angels, alongside Dipoto for most of that time. Dipoto resigned as the Angels' GM on July 1. \nNot only did Dipoto and Servais work together with the Angels, they were teammates for one season in Colorado in 2000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:31:57.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
