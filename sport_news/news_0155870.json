Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press Oct 5, 2015 at 9:48p ET 0Shares \nDefense has been one of the biggest question marks in recent years when it came to the viability of the Green Bay Packers as a Super Bowl contender. \nSo far, it's not a problem after the first four games of the regular season. \nMove over, Aaron Rodgers -- the Packers' defense is rolling too. \n\"They always say defenses win championships. As long as we're all playing on all cylinders, we can't be beat,\" outside linebacker Nick Perry said. He had two of Green Bay's six sacks in a 17-3 win Sunday over the San Francisco 49ers. \nThe Packers (4-0) are using a familiar formula on defense in focusing on stopping the run to turn teams into a one-dimensional passing offense. \nWhen Green Bay's offense scores in bunches, it helps the defense even more because pass rushers such as Perry can concentrate on getting to the quarterback with the opponent playing catch-up. \nFour weeks of improvement built up to a dominating performance in San Francisco. The Packers held the 49ers to 77 yards rushing and 196 yards overall. The defense has 13 sacks over the past two games. \nGreen Bay has come a long way from the season opener, when Chicago's Matt Forte hurt the Packers for 141 yards on 24 carries. \n\"Four wins and getting better each and every week on defense is what you're looking to do,\" coach Mike McCarthy said Monday evening at Lambeau Field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:13:43.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
