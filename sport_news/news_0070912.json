The play helped set up a 21-yard Kaepernick touchdown to Quinton Patton and a 25-13 lead.

(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nSmith downplayed facing his former team all week, and felt pretty much the same way after catching three passes for 96 yards. \n``I said it wasn't a big deal. I still feel that way, even after the game is over,'' Smith said. ``It was weird to look across and know I was competing against them. But I'm all in out West. That doesn't change how special my time was there or how much people in that organization mean to me, but I have a job to do out here.'' \nSmith, averaging 23.1 yards per catch on 14 receptions this season, beat former 49ers Shareece Wright on fake and was led perfectly by Kaepernick for the 74-yard touchdown. \n``That was a double move. I was able to beat him,'' Smith said. ``I had to keep my feet. Kap threw it, I was able to catch it and then I was in the end zone.''

Boldin fell on the ball, knocked the wind out of himself and didn't return, but the damage had been done. \n``Definitely I feel the team looks to me as one of the guys that needs to make a play, to step up,'' Boldin said. ``I always feel that way.'' \nSmith has seen Boldin's act both with Baltimore and the 49ers, so the end result came as no surprise. \n``Any time the ball's up and Anquan' has a chance on it, you've got to believe he's going to come down with it,'' Smith said. ``That was a tough play. Jimmy was all over him. If he doesn't make that play, we probably don't move down the field. We were kind of stalling a little bit.'' \nKaepernick credited Boldin's ``very strong hands and competitive nature. You put the ball up 99 times out of a hundred, he's going to come down with it.''

(D. Ross Cameron/Bay Area News Group) ( D. ROSS CAMERON ) \nFullback Bruce Miller, who got into the big play act with three receptions for 89 yards in the first quarter, believes Boldin saves his best for the biggest moments. \n``He's made 'em since he showed up here, with contested catches at big points in the game where we need a play and he makes it,'' Miller said. ``You can't put a price on what he does for our offense and our team.''
