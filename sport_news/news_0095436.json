But today (Saturday) I can defend those decisions, either as a referee or a West Ham manager. \n\"They were not mistakes; they were opinions. But probably in Kiev and a week ago against Southampton, that game and then that game, it is too much for a manager. I would probably be the same.\" \nMatic and his Chelsea team-mates were convinced the Serbia international's fouls – first on Cheikhou Kouyate and then Diafra Sakho – had not merited more than one yellow card in total. \nBilic again was partially sympathetic. \n\"The sending-off, I didn't see any replays,\" he said. \"The first one it looked like definitely (a yellow card), it was clear. The second one was very far form me. It looked like Sakho was already gone, so it looked like a yellow as well. \n\"But to be fair, if it was my player I would say it was harsh. My philosophy is that second bookings, especially if they are in the first half, they should be 'proper' bookings. I don't mean chopping off legs.\" \nWhile Zouma's close call was the result of an uncontestable decision by goal-line technology, Bilic admitted: \"I would definitely moan if it was against us.\" – AFP Opinion", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:50:56.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
