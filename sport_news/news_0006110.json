But I just work here.\nFriday, with the Royals winning Game 6 of the ALCS, 3-1, K.C. manager Ned Yost brought in Kelvin Herrera to pitch with one out in the sixth.\nHerrera was terrific; retired all five Jays he faced, two on strikeouts.\nAh, but he’s not “assigned” to pitch the eighth. Even with three days to rest had the Royals held the lead, Herrera “had” to be pulled. The eighth “belongs” to Ryan Madson. Yost, as now do most managers, plays it by “The Book,” one filled with modern myths and wish-based theories that fantasize pre-scripted endings.\nMadson allowed a single, a game-tying home run then a walk, before he was pulled.\nOn FOX, the removal of Herrera at such a point in the game and the series and in spite of his spotless pitching, didn’t make a sound. What made no sense — if I’m to assume I wasn’t alone — didn’t even make the cut as a discussion point.\nIn fact, at the top of the telecast, analyst Tom Verducci noted that K.C. starter Yordano Ventura only had to go five before the Royals could plug in a different reliever — one for each remaining inning, FOX even showing them on the screen in presumed, by-the-book photo order.\nWe’re no longer even asked to consider the unknown vagaries of baseball, but only to recognize such choreographed, by-the-book endings as a given. We didn’t even hear Herrera had last pitched two days before — one inning, allowing a hit but striking out the other three batters.\nStill, Yost “fixed” what clearly wasn’t broken. And so what makes perfect sense to those who manage the games and those who call the games, continues to escape the application of even a flake of practical, applicable sense.\n“Kid, you were untouchable, tonight, absolutely terrific.”\n“Then why’d you take me out?”\n“Well, Madson pitches the eighth. See? It’s right here in The Book.”\nAnd not only does such an answer make no sense — not even in Game 6 of the ALCS, and we presume restarting Tuesday night — it’s the same answer provided by managers and the media as if it makes complete sense.\nNCAA broadcasters have little mouth discipline Chris Fowler Photo: AP The craziest part is that announcers who never before talked genuine gridiron gibberish now feel compelled to substitute plain, sensible talk with silly-slick.\nAs Ohio St. QB J.T. Barrett ran around left end then downfield against Rutgers on Saturday, ESPN’s Chris Fowler, while Barrett was still running, hollered, “And Barrett shows his skills set!” Good grief.\nESPN analyst Ray Bentley, during Penn St.-Maryland, advised we note Penn St. QB Christian Hackenberg’s improved “eye discipline.”\nDuring ESPN’s Indiana-Michigan St., analyst Ed Cunningham, after MSU completed a 7-yard pass on second-and-13, didn’t bother with “7-yard gain,” choosing only to note MSU “picked up positive yardage.”\nGood stuff: FOX’s Joe Buck, at the top of Friday’s ALCS Game 6, somewhat dismissed data that appeared on the screen with: “We give you some of the stats, but this is all history. Whether it’s recent history or franchise history, it has nothing to do with tonight.”\nBuck scored again, Sunday, characterizing the first half of Cowboys-Giants as “a fizzle.” Perfect!\nCBS’ Jets-Pats, Sunday: Full attention paid to the game, not to those in funny hats, painted faces, the shirtless holding/spilling beer. Standard work by director Bob Fishman and crew.\nESPN, during Indiana-Michigan St., was surprisingly, honorably quick to post an “Upset Alert” — Tennessee had just taken a 14-13 lead at Alabama with “5:49 left in fourth.” UT-’Bama was CBS’ game, thus a tacit invite to switch networks. Here’s hoping no one’s fired for that.\nOn ESPNU, Duke-Virginia Tech was in its fourth OT, thus after a tying TD, Duke was required to go for two. Analyst John Congemi said not to dismiss the possibility of a QB-keeper from the 3-yard line, “as strange as that sounds.” Duke QB Tom Sirk, 6-foot-4, 220, rolled, broke a tackle then scored the game-ender, er, walk-off.\nSome broadcasters can watch games for decades and never quite grasp what they’re watching.\nSaturday, Michigan St. lined up to punt from the Indiana 41, thus one could logically expect the punter to aim a shorty at one of the corners. And that’s what Jake Hartbarger did. Yet, ESPN’s Mike Patrick immediately declared it “A horrible kick!”\nWhen it bounced out of bounds at the IU 6, Patrick spoke of that as if Hartbarger got away with it.\nOf course — not that “experts” know better — such short, effective kicks count against punters’ averages, bringing us to another issue. There are no average plays in football. Yet, it’s presented to us as a game of average plays and results!\nNorthwestern’s Justin Jackson tries to elude Nebraska’s Josh Banderas in a game in which “Big Red” wore black. Photo: Getty Images Saturday, ESPN2, at halftime of Northwestern-Nebraska — “Big Red” was the team in black — a graphic told us Nebraska’s offense faced an “average of 6.1 yards on third down.”\nWhat does such arithmetic research tell us? Anything and nothing! After all, third-and-1, third-and-2 and third-and-15 make an average of third-and-6.\nReplay no home run Mike Moustakas, Friday, hit one deep to right. A fan reached out and over, touching it on the fly. It was called a home run. The Blue Jays protested.\nOn FOX, replays conclusively proved to Joe Buck and Harold Reynolds it was not a home run, thus Moustakas hit a ground-rule double.\nBut the replay challenge upheld the call; it was a home run, 2-0. Proving, again, that “getting it right” as per replay rules is often just a matter of opinion.\nFriday’s rain-delay studio show starring Pete Rose, dressed like Uncle Floyd, and Frank Thomas in an inane debate as to how teams might spend delays was, well, had FOX borrowed Ch. 11’s Yule Log tape it would’ve been more enlightening, less embarrassing.\nKen Molloy, Syosset, suggests that Noah Syndergaard’s curveball be called “Noah’s Arc.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:56:02.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
