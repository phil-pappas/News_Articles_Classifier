Sierra received the opening kickoff, drove to the 6-yard line and was promptly stopped by the Buffaloes. A 23-yard field goal attempt sailed wide, and the green team wouldn’t relent. Manteca hammered rival Sierra 43-8 in a Valley Oak League game at Daniel Teicheira Memorial Stadium Friday, punctuated by a 21-0 second half. “There was so much momentum from them not being able to score. You could just feel it,” said Buffaloes coach Eric Reis, on the opening possession. “Even though the score was close, it felt like that was the turning point.” It took Manteca (6-0, 3-0 VOL) three drives to score, and when it did, 5-foot-11, 205-pound sophomore Ferrin Manuleleua ran in a 5-yard touchdown. Manuleleua added a two-point conversion, and later provided a mammoth hit on defense to force a turnover on downs. As an underclassman still finding his voice, Manuleleua was quiet at first, senior linebacker Darrion Kitson said, but not so much anymore. “We already knew he had the beast inside of him,” Kitson said. “We just had to get him out of his shell.” There was nothing quiet about Kitson’s performance, as the 6-3, 240-pound linebacker and fullback took nine carries for a game-high 68 yards and three touchdowns. The Buffaloes didn’t start feeding Kitson until the second quarter, and him running angry against tired legs paid off. “We knew going into this game they were real stout,” Reis said. “Our game plan was to go for the edges, get them a little bit tired, and go for the hammer inside.” Kitson’s first two touchdowns pushed Manteca to a 22-8 lead at intermission, and he virtually strolled in from 5 yards out in the third quarter to widen the gap. The Buffaloes would add a 21-yard quarterback keeper touchdown run from senior Dakarai Charles, and a 3-yard plunge from senior captain Marcus Rivas. The Manteca defense shined once again, is now allowing an average of 3 points per game and held Sierra (3-3, 1-2) under 100 yards of total offense, including less than 20 in the second half. “Of course, at Manteca, we’re all about defense,” Manuleleua said. The Buffaloes held Timberwolves senior running back Mark Paule Jr. to a career-low 27 rushing yards on 12 carries, winning the battle of the trenches early and often. Manteca may not have mashers like Billy Sharmoug, Darrell Clemons or Steven Martinez anymore, but Reis loves the edge of his group. “Offensive line play is a lot of how much fight’s in the dog,” Reis said. “Now, I’d love to have a giant dog with a big heart, but obviously, it’s how hard you fight.” Manteca has won 15 of 21 all-time matchups with Sierra, which likely needs to win three of its remaining four games to return to the Sac-Joaquin Section playoffs. “Our back’s against the wall now. It’s a cliché, but it’s true. If we want to be in the postseason, there’s a magic number we have to reach. And that has to be our ultimate goal,” Timberwolves coach Jeff Harbison said. “They stifled us defensively.” Sierra junior quarterback Mark Vicente found senior wide receiver Jimmy Galindo for a 15-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter, and Paule ran in the two-point conversion via a direct snap play. Charles finished 8 of 13 passing for 128 yards for the Buffaloes, while Ronaldo Tijero and Javaun Dunn each nabbed an interception and Rivas had a sack. Marcos Castillo had an interception and Andrew Guevara added a sack for the Timberwolves. Manteca, Oakdale and Modesto-Central Catholic are in a three-way tie atop the VOL, and Manteca hosts Central Catholic at 7 p.m. next Friday at Guss Schmiedt Field. Last season, the Raiders nipped the Buffaloes 29-28 in overtime in Modesto. “They’re probably one of the best teams I’ve ever faced in the history of my coaching career,” said Reis, in his 14th season guiding Manteca. His players know it, too, but are embracing the stage. “We expect them to come at us,” Kitson said. — Contact reporter Thomas Lawrence at (209) 546-8272 or tlawrence@recordnet.com.
