He appears to be just a lot more relaxed and a lot more at peace again with being the Cavaliers' name guy. \nCLEVELAND, Ohio – For LeBron James, there's always pressure. \nThere's the pressure to win. It's a prerequisite to carving one's place on the NBA's Mount Rushmore. Maybe James is already on it. Perhaps there's more carving to be done. \nJames owns two NBA championships, but none in Cleveland, where the Cavs have never won and no major pro sports franchise has captured a title since 1964. Oddsmakers and league general managers made the Cavs their pick to win it all in 2015-16. \nThere's the pressure to play great. James, a star and household name across America before he was even drafted No. 1 by the Cavs in 2003 out of Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary, is a four-time MVP. He was the only player in the league last year to average at least 25 points, six rebounds, and seven assists per game while shooting .480 from the field, and the Cavs went 2-11 without him. \nHe finished third in the MVP race. \nThere's the pressure of time, or age. \nJames is only 30, but he's logged the mileage (which, in NBA lingo, means minutes, in his case more than 43,000 of them over 12 seasons) of someone much older. \nHe's a superbly conditioned athlete with his own trainer and around-the-clock access to all medical marvels. He's also taken two injections in his occasionally ailing back in 10 months, leaving his status for Tuesday's season opener somewhat in question . \nThere's the pressure to be LeBron James. It means breaking up with McDonald's , calling for greater gun control , sharing a stage with Michelle Obama , walking a red carpet with Amy Schumer , communicating with 24 million Twitter followers, and traveling the globe because there's a Nike shoe with his name stitched on it. \nJames can never really let his guard down. The world is always watching, and he has a brand worth more than $65 million a year to protect. \nNow, here's the catch. \nAs James prepares to begin his 13 th pro season when the Cavaliers open in Chicago, with all those pressures perched upon his shoulders, he seems more at ease in Cleveland than he did at this time a year ago. His coach has noticed a change. \n\"I don't know that any of us can possibly even imagine what it is to be LeBron on a daily basis,\" said Cavs coach David Blatt, who took a full year to understand the complexities of coaching a basketball player with James' star power. \n\"You know what I mean? And what he had to go through last year, in terms of coming back. ... That's not an easy thing for anyone. And I feel like he came back this year without all of that noise and fanfare and weight. You know, just, he appears to be just a lot more relaxed and a lot more at peace again with being the Cavaliers' name guy.\" \nA man in command \nJames is already on his second contract with the Cavs since returning to the franchise in the summer of 2014. He inked a two-year, $47 million contract in July , which, much like he did with the contract he inked in 2014, he'll probably terminate with his player's option. \nIt's a matter of business, James has often said. By doing contracts this way, James maintains the financial flexibility to earn as much money as possible each season, and perhaps one day take advantage of exploding league revenues to become the NBA's first $200 million player. \nJames also holds leverage over the Cavs to put a championship-caliber team around him or risk losing him. But the organization has indeed amassed arguably the league's deepest roster – there's $330 million tied up in Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thompson, and Iman Shumpert. \n\"I think our owner is committed to winning,\" James said in praising owner Dan Gilbert and signaling that, no, he most likely isn't going anywhere. \nAnd yet, James seemed uncomfortable early in his return to the Cavs, at least from a basketball perspective, over the first few months of the season. \nYou remember how it ended, with James lifting his team into the Finals, turning in one of the best individual performances in NBA Finals history, and dragging the wounded Cavs to two wins against the Warriors . \nBut in the beginning, when the entire basketball world descended upon Cleveland to record history, James struggled with his emotions as he was frustrated by Blatt, some young teammates, and a body that was giving him trouble. \n\"The Finals show what I am capable of doing,\" James said in a brief interview with the Northeast Ohio Media Group. \"You know, last year was a feel-out process for all of us, so I think some of my production was down because of that, I was more like, 'I need to see what we're capable of doing.' \" \nThe last time people really saw James play – the 28 shots he took in two preseason games don't count – they witnessed him at perhaps his greatest, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists in the Finals. \nBut neither Love nor Irving was available for most of the championship round. When they were on the court, James changed his game to be a little more of a facilitator. He still averaged 25.3 points (near a career low) and suffered his first drop in his shooting percentage year over year since 2007. But he also registered a career-high 7.4 assists. \nJames has already committed to expanding Love's options on offense. When Irving returns from injury, James will further be able to execute the role he covets during a long, 82-game grind that is an NBA season – scoring and attacking when necessary, but making an equal impact creating opportunities (with less stress on his body) for his ultra-talented teammates. \nIf he averages at least 25 points this season, he'll set an NBA record for 12 consecutive seasons scoring that many points per game, breaking his current tie with Karl Malone and Jerry West. But that streak could be in jeopardy. \n\"I think he's playing his best complete basketball now,\" said 3-point specialist James Jones, who played with James in Miami before joining him with the Cavs last season. \"He relies on every facet of his game— his ability to pass, his ability to score, his ability to shoot. He's constantly working on his game, he's constantly evolving, and this team poses a challenge for him because we have so many good players and now he's playing with a stacked deck and he's the type of guy that relishes that opportunity. \n\"What he does this year will be unlike anything he's ever done in the past because this team is definitely one of the more loaded teams he's ever played with,\" Jones said. \nLogging miles, chasing milestones \nJames is currently 20 th all-time in scoring (24,913 points). He'll pass West, Reggie Miller, and Alex English in fairly short order, with a chance to maybe catch Oscar Robertson (26,710 points), who is in 11 th place. \n(Three players in front of James, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Tim Duncan, are all still active.) \nAnd yet, there are mile markers all over the place to remind James of his own basketball mortality. Last year, James missed a career-high 13 games, mostly due to nagging knee and back injuries, and there is growing confusion over his health entering this season after receiving a second shot in his back since Jan. 1 and missing the last two weeks of practices. \nAlso this week, an overwhelming majority of NBA GMs said they would choose 22-year-old New Orleans big man Anthony Davis, and not James, as a player around whom they would most want to build a franchise. \nJames, who turns 31 on Dec. 30, would be the 10 th player in league history over the age of 30 to win to be named MVP, and first since 31-year-old Steve Nash did it in 2006. \nOf the previous nine players over the age of 30, only Malone (age 35, in 1999) had logged more NBA minutes (45,548) heading into his MVP season than James' 43,330 minutes entering this year. \nThe others to win the award past 30 were Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998, Hakeem Olajuwon (1994), Magic Johnson (1990), Julius Irving (1981), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1980), Wilt Chamberlain (1967 and 1968) and Bill Russell (1965). \nLike Jordan and Chamberlain, Nash (2005) and Malone (1997) both collected two MVPs past their 30th birthday. \nUnlike the nine elder MVPs, James never played in college. Two former MVPs who (like James) went straight from high school to the NBA, Garnett and Kobe Bryant, didn't win the award past 29. \nGarnett, now 39, saw his scoring and rebounding begin to drop as soon as he hit 30, but he was a leader on Boston's 2008 title team. Bryant, 37, continued to thrive in his early 30s, but has played in just 41 games over the past two seasons due to injury. \n\"It's all about LeBron, as long as he stays healthy,\" said Miller, now an NBA analyst for TNT. \"If he's healthy and he's on the court, it's hard to beat that dude four times (in a playoff series).\" \nLast year, James averaged a career-low 36.1 minutes per game, but he was still third in the NBA in minutes. As the Cavs struggle to explain James' absence from practice now and their desire to keep him upright this season, they continue to come back to the theme of managing the wear and tear on his body. \nThese are heavy questions for an organization and a superstar who expect greatness. How can it all be done? \n\"I don't know, I don't like talking about it,\" James said. \"You'll see.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:53:03.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
