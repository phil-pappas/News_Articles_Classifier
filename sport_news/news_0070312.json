I just know you want to meet me,’ that’s not a natural act for me,” he said.\nDespite that, Conway, 46, has seemingly been at the center of Kentucky politics for the last two decades – first as a staffer to Gov. Paul Patton, then as a candidate challenging an entrenched incumbent in a congressional race, then running for and winning the office of attorney general, then running unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate and now running for governor.\nUnlike the 2010 Senate race in which he found himself answering for the policies of President Barack Obama and then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Conway said the governor’s office seems to play more to his strengths.\n\"I've always enjoyed public policy, I've always enjoyed trying to figure out what program will work best and I would say I have broad-based policy experience,\" Conway said.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nConway has big money edge over Bevin\nPath to the Patton administration\nConway grew up in what is now a wealthy family in Louisville but with very humble roots. His father was raised on a farm in Union County. Tom Conway did a hitch in the military and then moved to Louisville, where he worked as a high school teacher and football coach while attending law school at the University of Louisville.\nConway went to St. Xavier High School and then onto Duke University, where he majored in public policy, though he was not certain what he would do with that degree. After graduating from Duke, he was off to Washington D.C., where he worked as a congressional staffer while attending George Washington University’s law school.\nPatton hired Conway fresh out of the National Law Center at George Washington University as deputy general counsel and a top aide to Crit Luallen, who was Patton’s secretary of the executive cabinet.\nConway came of age, politically speaking, in those early days of the Patton administration, when Patton was rewriting laws on higher education, pushing for universal garbage collection in a state soiled by illegal dumps, and trying to put an end to straight pipes that dumped raw sewage into Kentucky’s streams and creeks.\nConway, who describes himself as \"wonkish,\" said he learned from Patton, who often focused on a goal and then worked closely with key players to hammer out compromises.\nDenis Fleming, Patton’s general counsel, said Conway had his hand in issues ranging from tax incentives that helped UPS expand in Kentucky to the historic higher education reform, which, among other things, used government money to help leverage private donations to endow teaching and research positions at state schools.\nFleming said it was largely Conway who took the ideas from endless hours of meetings and crafted the higher education reform legislation eventually approved by the Kentucky General Assembly.\n“He had drafts of that bill stacked all over his office, from floor to ceiling. He wrote most of that bill,\" Fleming said.\n\"He was obviously a smart individual, but he had the right values, he was interested in getting involved in public service and he was very friendly, easy going, easy to like, easy to get along with,\" said Patton. \"I likened him to Kentucky's version of John F. Kennedy when he first got the bug to run.\"\nRunning for office\nConway said his plan wasn’t always to run for office. He liked the policy side of government. “The electoral part of it came later,” he said. “After four of five years (working for Patton) they saw something in me I didn’t see in myself and encouraged me to run for office.”\nConway considered challenging Republican U.S. Rep. Anne Northup in Kentucky's 3rd Congressional District in 2000, but decided against it.\nIn 2002, as it appeared Patton may be gearing up for a U.S. Senate run two years later, the governor again urged the young Conway to challenge Northup.\nIt was a tough race for a first-time candidate, but it got even tougher six weeks before the election when WHAS-TV aired a report accusing Patton of having an affair with Tina Conner, whom he had given board appointments.\nNorthup used Patton’s problems against Conway and won by 3.2 percentage points. Conway rebounded five years later to win the office of attorney general as Republicans were reeling from an ethics scandal, and then fell to defeat again in 2010 when he lost to Rand Paul as the specter of Obama loomed large.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nConway leads Bevin in new Bluegrass Poll\nIn Conway’s two terms as attorney general, he has had to deal with cuts that forced him to reduce his office budget by 40 percent. He came into office as the nation had just entered an 18-month recession and will leave it with the state still trying to emerge from it.\nOn the campaign trail, he talks about his efforts on prescription drugs, mentioning that he has shuttered half the state’s pain clinics and has joined other states to sue pharmaceutical companies.\nConway took money from settlements with drug companies and helped fund drug treatment centers.\nRick Wurth, the CEO of the Children’s Home of Northern Kentucky , credits Conway with getting the money needed to start a drug treatment program for kids between ages 13 and 17 at the home.\nWurth said the agency was able to use startup money from Conway’s office to hire staff and now the program is self-sustaining.\n“I don’t know if someone else could have done it, but his assistance and perseverance to do something, especially for adolescents, sure expedited things,” Wurth said of Conway. “At the very least, it wouldn’t have happened as quickly without him.”\nConway also points out that he has worked to pull some 800,000 child porn images off the Internet and sued the Environmental Protection Agency to block regulations that could negatively impact Kentucky’s coal economy.\nPatton, who was a coal operator, said he taught Conway that coal is important for Kentucky even outside the coal fields because it provides low-cost power throughout the state. “He understands that,” Patton said.\nConway also has sued five for-profit colleges alleging that they had taken advantage of students.\nGrover Potts, a Republican and a lawyer for Spencerian College, a subject of one of the lawsuits, has accused Conway of “grandstanding” on the issue and said that the school did not inflate job placement rates in its advertising as Conway has claimed.\n“I think Conway was involved in a group effort by a number attorneys general and, following along with Sen. (Tom) Harken, of Iowa, they’ve taken a very broad brush and said that, in essence, the colleges that are for profit are hurting students,\" Potts said.\nDespite his disagreement with Conway on that, Potts has contributed $500 to Conway’s campaign, saying he believes Conway would make a better governor than Bevin.\nGubernatorial candidate Jack Conway discusses splititng Cabinet for Health and Family Services as a \"Day One\" possibility if he's elected\nOn a recent trip campaign trip to Court Day in Preston, Ky., Conway stopped by a booth that was selling guns. After walking away, Art Cummins, an independent voter who used to be a Republican and a former army staff sergeant, said he planned to vote for Conway because he had once called his office about veterans who were having trouble getting federal funds for college, and he helped.\n\"He returned the call, he put his people on it and he got it solved,\" said Cummins, who lives in Bath County.\nOne place that Conway has tried to act but failed is on the issue of gas prices. Upon taking office, Conway launched an investigation into gas prices in Kentucky. Ultimately, the office found that gas prices are inflated in the state because of the merger of the Ashland and Marathon oil companies.\nHe sought help from the Federal Trade Commission and then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to enforce anti-trust laws and was rebuffed. Finally, in May, he filed suit against Marathon Oil . That suit is pending.\nHe’s received the most criticism from Republicans over the fact that he opted not to appeal late U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II’s ruling striking down the state’s same-sex marriage ban.\nBevin and others have accused Conway of “not doing his job.” They claim that Conway failed to perform his duty when he didn’t prosecute an appeal, forcing Gov. Steve Beshear to hire outside counsel to do it.\nConway has argued that he did, in fact, do his job because the law give gives him the responsibility to weigh whether an appeal is warranted and whether it can ultimately be successful. In this case, Conway argued that Heyburn’s ruling was correct.\nUltimately, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Heyburn.\nThroughout two terms as attorney general, Conway largely avoided scandal, although opponents have criticized him for an episode that involved his brother, Matt Conway, a former assistant Jefferson County Commonwealth’s Attorney.\nAfter a political supporter called Jack Conway and told him that he had heard from a police officer that the Louisville Metro Police Department was conducting a drug investigation against Matt Conway, Conway contacted his brother.\nThe next day, the Conways met with lawyer Bart Adams, where it was decided Adams would report the police officer to then-Police Chief Robert White. Matt Conway was not charged.\nAfter The Courier-Journal first reported the meeting, The American Thinker, a conservative website, questioned whether Conway had acted ethically. Conway’s office has said only that Conway’s sole involvement was to urge his brother to hire a lawyer.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nJack Conway introduces education program\nIn this campaign, Conway has called for increased spending on early childhood education to improve lives. He points out that Bevin has questioned the usefulness of early childhood education programs and has called for a voucher system for schools that Conway says would devastate public education.\nOn the campaign trail, he notes that Bevin has called for drug testing of seniors on Medicare, though Bevin’s campaign has said it was simply a gaffe. And he charges that Bevin would dismantle Kentucky’s health care exchange and do away with Gov. Steve Beshear’s Medicaid expansion.\n“This race isn’t a ‘want to,’ it’s a ‘have to,’” Conway tells groups he speaks to. “Folks, if you believe in public education, this race is a ‘have to.’ If you believe in early childhood education, this race is a ‘have to.’ And if you believe in health care for our citizens, then this race is a ‘have to.’ … Heck if you believe seniors ought to be able to get Medicare without drug testing, then this race is a ‘have to.' ”\nKentucky attorney general Jack Conway speaks at the Fancy Farm picnic Saturday afternoon.
