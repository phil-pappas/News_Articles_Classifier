Some wish it eradicated; some wish it expanded.\nMarijuana? Oh, heavens no.\nI'm talking \"grass\" as in milfoil, coontail, hydrilla, naiads, duck weed and other species of aquatic vegetation that have made dramatic comebacks in recent years throughout the Tennessee River system.\nBy far, Guntersville Lake in Alabama is headquarters for this growth. Chickamauga, near Chattanooga, comes in second. But there are expanding patches in several upstream lakes, including Nickajack, Watts Bar, Melton Hill and Fort Loudoun.\nFriends and foes are easy to identify. Seldom do they share middle ground.\nIf you (a) fish, especially for bass, (b) hunt waterfowl or (c) are guided by environmental concerns, you embrace this resurgence like a lottery jackpot.\nConversely, if you (a) own lakefront property, (b) are a pleasure boater or (c) enjoy water skiing, this is worse than having a lazy, obnoxious relative show up at your doorstep, suitcase in hand.\nIn the middle of it all is David Brewster.\nA longtime TVA employee stationed in Guntersville, Ala., Brewster is manager of natural resources for the agency's western division. He also serves as chief of aquatic plant management for the main river and its tributaries.\nBack in the 1960s and '70s, Brewster noted, TVA waged all-out war on aquatic vegetation. The prevailing attitude could be capsulized in two words: kill everything.\nThese days, there's a more balanced approach.\n\"We learned total eradication simply isn't feasible, both from economic and environmental standpoints,\" he said. \"Today, we're trying to address the concerns of all reservoir stakeholders.\"\nOn Guntersville, TVA now takes \"aggressive management\" (aka federally approved herbicides and closely monitored applications) around public use areas, boat launches, state parks and non-profit campgrounds, Brewster said. Beyond that, the agency strives to bring representatives from both \"pro\" and \"con\" camps together to reach a compromise.\n\"It usually takes 1½ to 2 years to pull these parties together and work out a reservoir-wide plan,\" he said.\nThe way Brewster described the process, each side pretty much comes to initial meetings with a take-no-prisoners mindset.\n\"But the more they work together, we start to see mutual respect and understanding develop between homeowners, hunters, fishermen, economic developers and environmentalists,\" he said.\n\"In fact, the plan for Guntersville has been praised by BASS (Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, kingpin in competitive fishing circles) as a very balanced approach. There's no doubt that Guntersville is one of the most popular bass lakes in the country, mainly due to the vegetation.\"\nChickamauga, too. Last February, this grass-heavy lake produced a 15-pound, 3-ounce largemouth, eclipsing the 14½-pound state record that had stood since 1954. The monster was caught by Gabe Keen, 28, a Caryville resident and history-geography teacher at Campbell County High School, who also serves as coach of the school's bass-fishing team.\nWide-spread herbicides aren't the only approach TVA has tried. Brewster recalled a 1990s-era introduction of 100,000 sterile white amur (grass carp) into Guntersville. The non-reproducing fish worked — all too well.\n\"They cleaned up grass in the main channel and around docks, but then they moved back into some of the remote areas, including portions of the lake managed for waterfowl and other birds,\" he said. \"We believe most of these fish have died out by now. A bow-fisherman shot a 92-pounder earlier this year. We have no way of knowing, but I'd guess it was one of the last of the original stocking.\"\nHomeowners still can spot-treat areas around their docks, Brewster added, but only if they use the services of professional, licensed applicators well-versed in specific chemicals and dosages. That's because the river system serves as the main drinking water supply throughout the Tennessee Valley.\n\"This is a lot like treating weeds in your yard,\" he said. \"You need to apply something specifically designed for that plant. For example, what works on broadleaf weeds like dandelions won't work for crabgrass.\"\nEven then, nature itself may hold the ultimate trump card.\n\"Most forms of aquatic vegetation are light-sensitive,\" said Brewster. \"It's hard for them to reproduce in turbid water. For several years in the 1990s, we received a series of spring floods that muddied the river just as plants were developing. It really knocked back a lot of growth.\n\"We're in a dry spell right now, which has assisted the comeback of many of these plants. A few years from now, spring flooding might knock them back again. Who knows?\"\nColumnist Sam Venable was the News Sentinel's outdoors editor 1970-85. During those years, he caught many bass and decoyed many ducks in the \"grass flats\" of Nickajack, Chickamauga and Guntersville — and also cursed heatedly when dense mats of the stuff continually bound the props on his outboard engine and trolling motor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:22:12.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
