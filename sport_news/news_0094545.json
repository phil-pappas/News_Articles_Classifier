Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 9:00 PM As you know, T.D. is the one to look to when you need your inside info on the local high school football scene. I'm putting in the endless hours of research and watching game film to give you the hot picks, such as Wellesley beating Walpole for the first time since 1999. That’s right, T.D. saw and the Raiders conquered. Of course, I need to clarify. Pointer puts in the hours and gets the inside edge on the gridiron, but I am no DraftKings or FanDuel. There is no trading my information with fellow pickers to give them the advantage: I sit alone at the top. But all this controversy between these two fantasy sports sites and the overall excitement about fantasy football got me thinking. How about matching wits with other pickers in a high school fantasy league? Get the best pigskin prognosticators around and really see who knows the ins and outs of the local scene. It got its trial run last weekend and Pointer did not disappoint. The Fighting T.D.’s rolled out a lineup that would make even Todd Kiley and the Holliston Panthers a little nervous. One of those players is very well known to Coach Kiley: Panther kicker Grant Buchanan. If your offense is racking up the points then the kicker is sure to follow, as Buchanan put home five extra points on Friday night. Quarterback was a tough decision for Pointer, with Valley Tech’s Hector Petri and Uxbridge’s Max White-Cohen both available. White-Cohen was outstanding with 232 yards and four touchdowns, but my decision to roll with Petri was rewarded with 153 yards passing, 80 yards rushing, and four combined touchdowns. Lincoln-Sudbury’s Ethan McCollough highlighted the running back position with 163 yards and three touchdowns, while Oliver Sawyer of Uxbridge led my receiving corps with four catches and two touchdowns. Of course the no-brainer of the weekend was starting the red-hot Wellesley defense. Even in a non-favorable matchup based on history, T.D. stood strong with his game prediction, and the Raiders paid off. Wellesley held Walpole to six points, bringing its total points allowed on the season to an astonishing 37 points in five games. Pointer will be looking to give the Fighting T.D.’s their second straight victory, but more importantly keep the game picks rolling. Now for the picks. Friday night starts in the Bay State Conference with Natick traveling out to play what is sure to be a very hungry Walpole team. The Redhawks picked up their second victory of the season last week, but a fourth loss comes this weekend at Walpole . The party in Framingham is going to be short-lived as Needham comes in and takes care of business. Page 2 of 2 - In Tri-Valley League Small action, Ashland will continue its hot streak and take down Millis-Hopedale, while Dover-Sherborn rebounds at home with a victory over Norton . Hopkinton crosses over to the TVL Small and takes out the frustration of two straight losses on Bellingham, while Holliston easily dispatches visiting TVL Large foe Medway. Wayland leaves Boston Latin victorious in Dual County League Small action, while Marlborough defends its home turf against visiting North Middlesex and Algonquin does the same against Holy Name. Leicester slows down the Uxbridge train in SWCL action, while Assabet gets another one in the “W” column on the road at Quaboag. Finally, in the Hockomock, Franklin will keep it close, but Mansfield will prove too much. Saturday will be highlighted by an afternoon tilt when undefeated Wellesley welcomes Norwood in Bay State Conference action. The Raiders, as mentioned, have been a brick wall on defense, but their offense has been inconsistent. The Mustangs have scored 107 points in their four wins, but only 28 in their last two games, both losses. This could become a bigger test than some think, but as the old adage goes, “Defense wins championships.” Take Wellesley . In non-league matchups, Shrewsbury and former Rangers head coach Mark Ellis will travel to Ellis’ old stomping ground of Westborough and make it an ugly reunion. Valley Tech will take care of host Sutton, and Worcester North defends its home turf against Blackstone-Millville. Tri-County will pick up its second win of the season in a Mayflower matchup with Bristol-Plymouth, while Lincoln-Sudbury will do the same at Dual County League Large host Waltham. Nipmuc will win a close one with visiting Burncoat and St. Clement will defeat Catholic Central visitor Marian. To wrap up the weekend, Milford will travel to Hockomock foe Sharon and rebound from last weekend’s loss to get back on the winning track. Last week: 16-6 T.D. Pointer is a Daily News Correspondent.
