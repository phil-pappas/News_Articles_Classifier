Our aim is to win the games against Ireland and Georgia and qualify for France,\" Loew said in a statement. \n\"I have a lot of faith in the players who did their duty in September. Those players are regularly forced to deliver in the Bundesliga and on European levels so they have a good rhythm.\" \n\"These are the conditions for the decisive games in this group,\" he said. \nBorussia Dortmund winger Marco Reus has also been called up after he dropped out of their squad due to a fractured toe following his call-up in September. \nGermany are top of their Group on 19 points from eight matches, two ahead of Poland and four off third-placed Ireland. \n\"We know how dangerous the Irish are, not only from our first game in Germany (which was a 1-1 draw),\" Loew said. \"To play in Dublin against Ireland makes it even more difficult. We can expect a great atmosphere and every fan will be firing on the Irish team until the last minute.\" \n\"The only thing that matters for us is to remain top of the group and qualify automatically for the Euro. After that it is a new situation where we can certainly try out things again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:43:40.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
