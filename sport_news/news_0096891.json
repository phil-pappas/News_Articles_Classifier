No lights at Dover so any delay could move race to Monday. \nHAPPY HARVICK: What would make Kevin Harvick and the No. 4 Stewart Haas Racing Chevrolet team really happy would be a in to advance the reigning Sprint Cup champ into the next round of the Chase for the Championship. \nLOSING TRACTION: After a courageous comeback from a broken leg and ankle Kyle Busch raced his way into the Chase but is falling into a familiar pattern of slipping once the final 10 races get underway. He needs a strong finish at Dover. \nSEVENTH HEAVEN?: Jimmie Johnson is a six-time Sprint Cup champion going for his seventh title and he has won at the one-mile Dover oval 10 times, including the spring race this season. \nMUSICAL CHAIRS: Over the next 18 months Clint Bowyer will have been behind the wheel of three different Cup cars. He leaves Michael Waltrip Racing this year to move to HScott Motorsports in 2016 and then takes over Tony Stewart’s No. 14 Chevrolet in 2017. \nHOME COOKING: Martin Truex Jr. hopes he can use his “home track” advantage at Dover to move his No. 78 Chevrolet to the next Chase round. He has top 10 results in the past three races at Dover. \nMOVING ON UP: The No. 31 Chevrolet team of Ryan Newman keeps moving up the standings, in sixth place without a win yet in 2015. He needs just a 16th-place finish at Dover to stay in the Chase. \nFEELING GASSED: Dale Earnhardt Jr. put a big dent in his chances of advancing past Dover when he ran out of gas and finished 25th at New Hampshire in the No. 88 Chevrolet. \nCOUSING CARL: There was lots of concern earlier in the season that the No. 19 Toyota of Carl Edwards was off the pace at JGR. Now he sits third in the Chase and will move on after Dover. \nPOLE POSITION: By virtue of Friday’s rainout, Matt Kenseth starts on the pole at Dover. He also gets the prized first pit stall and that should give him good track position all race long on Sunday. \nDEAN’S PICKS \nJimmie Johnson has won more races — 10 — at Dover International Speedway than any other NASCAR Sprint Cup driver in the history of the sport. It’s like Johnson uses Dover as his own private jumping off spot when he is aiming for yet another NASCAR championship. In fact in four of Johnson and the No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet team’s six Sprint Cup championship seasons he has won at the one mile concrete oval they call the Monster Mile. He seems in tune with every bump on the track. The rest of the grid may be bemoaning the lack of practice time this weekend because of rain but all Johnson has to do is look at his notes from the spring race for a winning setup. \nTHE BLIND SPOT \nThe final 10 races of the season, better known as the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship, don’t leave much room for a Chase outsider to win. On Saturday the best-of-the-rest included the No. 17 Ford of Ricky Stenhouse Jr., who posted a lap of 154.599 mph, good enough for 11th fastest of the final two rain-shortened practices at Dover International Speedway.
