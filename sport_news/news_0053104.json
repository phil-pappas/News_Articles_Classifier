Mr. Chan says that mirrors a principle he learned at Google of masking the complex with simplicity (think of the search engine’s minimalist home page).\nGoogle’s “egalitarian” principle—the idea that everyone has access to information—inspired Mr. Chan to program the home’s automation system, so that visitors can access on their smartphones through an app. Guests can play their own Spotify music mixes, or program a YouTube video to play on the home’s TV. “At Google, they teach you to be maniacal about details so people have delightful experience,” says Mr. Chan, who admits to being a stickler for the tiniest details, particularly the kind that help make guests more comfortable.\nCompleted in January, the sunny three-bedroom home features white oak floors and modern furniture, some of it custom-built by artists they found on Etsy , ETSY 2.62 % the online marketplace that went public in April .

On a recent evening, a friend came over to give a practice TED talk. The couple has also hosted presentations from startup founders looking for investors. “We’ve inked deals here for startups on everything from whiskey to doorbells,” Mr. Chan says.\nSanta Monica-based Jamie Siminoff founded Ring, a startup that makes a smartphone-accessible video “doorbell ,” which serves as both an intercom and security system. Mr. Siminoff says he’s spent many nights in the home’s CEO suite. “We kind of used [Mr. Chan’s] place as a test place,” he says, installing early versions of the doorbell, which records audio and video, on the front door. Mr. Chan says he gave feedback that helped guide later versions.\nThe installation led to an investment by Virgin Group founder Richard Branson . Messrs. Chan and Blute say they were at a business conference on Necker Island, Mr. Branson’s private Caribbean island resort. While there, Mr. Chan used Ring to communicate with a package delivery carrier at his doorstep, which he says he showed Mr. Branson, who became curious about the product and decided to invest. Mr. Chan also recently became an investor. “The CEO suite has been very profitable for me,” says Mr. Siminoff.\nDuring his time at Google, Mr. Chan (who says he can’t disclose his employee number) co-founded Google Analytics as well as Google Voice, and later was a general partner at Google Ventures, which has made early investments in companies like Nest and Uber. He met Mr. Blute, who has a background as a travel writer and host, while living in Seattle. They purchased their San Francisco home in 2013 for $2.25 million, according to public records. They estimate they’ve spent between $500,000 and $1 million on the renovation, which took a year and a half.\nTour a High-Tech San Francisco Home Wesley Chan and Pat Blute’s Edwardian home has all the bells and whistles of the digital age fullscreen After more than 12 years working at Google, Wesley Chan found a new project to pour his energy into—remodeling his new home.

Mr. Chan, who was still working for Google Ventures at the time, was drawn to the location in part because of its proximity to a corporate shuttle bus pickup spot. Both dealing with busy work schedules, they liked the fact that the home was basically move-in ready. They had the home inspected before they purchased it, but later discovered problems. They hired a contractor who ended up doing work that wasn’t up to code. When they realized they would have to tear up multiple walls to fix it, they then decided to hire an architect and undertake a total renovation to give the home a more open floor plan and reconfigure the layout.\nFirst, Mr. Blute says, they interviewed dozens of architects, eventually hiring Antje Paiz of Berkeley-based firm Raumfabrik.
