He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Las Vegas -- about 60 miles away. \nOdom, 35, won two NBA championships as a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers. \nHe married the younger sister of Kim Kardashian after a whirlwind romance in 2009, only to file for divorce four years later, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in July. \n'Everything was great' \nHof, the brothel owner, said Odom called him Saturday and told him he wanted to visit for a few days. \nHof let him stay at his home, which is attached to the brothel. \n\"He was having a good time at the ranch and everything was great,\" Hof said. \nUntil Sunday, when Lamar seemed \"a bit somber,\" Hof said, because people were \"calling and bothering him.\" \n'Late Tuesday, two women at the brothel went to check on Odom and found him unconscious, Hof said \n\"The girls and staff rush him out on the ambulance,\" he said. \n\"To my knowledge, there were no drugs involved. Lamar was eating well and was just healthy.\" \nReality star \nIn addition to appearing on \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians,\" Odom and Khloe Kardashian had their own reality show, \"Khloe & Lamar.\" \nIt lasted for two seasons and 20 episodes, and the couple filed for divorce in 2013. They signed divorce papers this year. \nDespite going separate ways, Khloe Kardashian has said she will always love him. \n\"I will never, ever not love Lamar,\" she told E!, which airs their reality shows. \"I was so obsessed with him in a healthy way. He was my husband, and I still wish he was.\" \nKardashian has expressed concerns for him, especially after his best friend died this year. \nDespite her family's objection, she regularly talked to her ex-husband by phone during episodes of \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" this season. \nVeteran NBA player \nOdom played for four teams during his 14 seasons in the NBA. \nHe was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers in 1999, and played there for four seasons before signing with the Miami Heat. \nAfter one season, he was traded to the Lakers, and was a key part of their championship teams in 2009 and 2010. \nA year later, he played briefly for the Dallas Mavericks before returning to the Clippers for one season. He has not returned to the NBA since. \nBut he has continued making headlines, including for a drunken driving charge two years ago. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
