It is even tougher when the opponent is the defending Division 2 state champion. And yet, the Whitman-Hanson girls soccer team keeps rolling. Despite watching freshman goalie Skyler Kuzmich depart due to injury on Thursday afternoon, the Panthers maintained their perfect record. Senior Makayla Clemens came off the bench to record a fill-in shutout as Whitman-Hanson (14-0, 12-0) blanked Hingham, 3-0, to clinch the top overall record in the Patriot League. Clemens was forced into duty after Kuzmich was hurt in a collision with two Hingham players and she responded with 15 saves. The Panthers also lost senior defender Kat O’Kane to injury with freshman Sammi Smith stepping in with a strong game defensively. “(Clemens) made some great saves coming in cold like that,” Whitman-Hanson coach David Floeck said. “She trains hard every day and you never know when your number is going to be called and it was called today and she answered it.” The game featured strong wind throughout and it was evident in the play as the team with the wind was able to control play. In a first half that ended scoreless, Hingham (10-5-1, 7-5-1) had the wind at its back and held an 11-2 shot advantage, but was unable to solve Clemens. “We went against it in the first half by choice,” Floeck said of the wind. “It was hard, the ball was going everywhere, it was even hard to get a good clear on the ball. We felt we were lucky to be 0-0 at the half.” The choice paid off in the second half, as the Panthers recorded 11 shots, and quickly got on the board when senior Rachel Kelly scored two minutes in off a cross from sophomore Lauren Bonavita. “With the wind at our back, we had an opportunity to put some pressure on them and we were able to open up the field,” Floeck said. Bonavita pushed the score to 2-0 in the 66th minute, as she finished off a cross from sophomore Taylor Kofton. The combo connected again in the 78th minute. “Lauren’s a great, composed finisher,” Floeck said. “And I always say ‘to score great goals, you have to get a great pass,’ and Kofton sent her two beautiful balls.” Despite a hard-fought battle, Hingham was unsatisfied with the result on their end. “We need to put 80 minutes together,” Hingham coach Ryan Puntiri said. “We showed that we could play with them, but not for 80 minutes today.” Page 2 of 2 - Hingham did get some good news this past week as junior Eve Hewins, a 30-goal scorer last season, returned to action after missing the first part of the season with a back injury. “I don’t know if I would consider Eve 100 percent yet,” Puntiri said. “It’s almost like her training camp right now, which is good because a lot of the younger players have stepped up big time.” Hewins did provide Hingham with some scoring chances, especially in the first half, but the Panthers defense was smothering, often keeping two defenders in her area. Junior goalkeeper Amy Kirk (10 saves) played a solid game for Hingham to keep the score within striking distance for almost the whole game. “If it wasn’t for Amy, we might have had a couple more there,” Floeck said. With both teams already qualified for their respective tournaments (Whitman-Hanson was runner-up in Div. 1 last year), both teams are looking to use the last week of the regular season to tune up for the playoffs. “We still have four tough games on the schedule in front of us,” Floeck said. “So were hoping to get playing our best soccer and regroup with some of our injuries.” David Konowitch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:48:11.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
