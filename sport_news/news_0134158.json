That legal protection often allows officers involved in possibly wrongful duty-related deaths to sway grand jurors in their favor, he said.\nBozeman said Blaise was not drug tested after the accident but Moore was drug tested. Police initially emphasized that Moore was out of the crosswalk when struck and Blaise was on a routine patrol, with no mention of the speeding.\nThe misdemeanor indictment means that Blaise faces a maximum sentence of only a year in jail, said Mawuli Mel Davis, another lawyer representing the family.\nThe family plans to lobby Atlanta City Hall to make drug testing mandatory for officers involved in car accidents and to lobby the legislature to amend the laws allowing police officers special privileges before grand juries, Davis said.\nBlaise has been on paid administrative leave since the incident, Davis said.\nAtlanta police did not immediately returns calls attempting to verify Blaise’s employment status.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:39:19.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
