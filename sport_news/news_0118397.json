Whether there is a more cost-effective way of delivering safety services is another matter, but we nevertheless applaud city governments for at least seeking different ways of doing things.\nA dozen cities are considering a range of alternatives, from forming individual police forces to creating joint police forces with other cities. The reasons are simple. Cities have been hit with contract cost increases of at least 7 percent annually for the past few years. As policing services often make up a majority of city budgets, such cost increases crowd out spending on other things.\nMoreno Valley, the largest of the contract cities, has been forced to cut safety and nonsafety services just to keep fiscally stable. San Jacinto city leaders have brought two tax proposals to residents to help prop up an increasingly strained budget. Both proposals were rejected.\nGiven the unsustainability of back-to-back years of large bumps in contract costs, cities have been floating the idea of alternatives for some time. The problem is, as onerous as the contract costs might be, setting up a single or multicity police force may be even worse.\n\"I don’t think [the cities] will, after thoughtful consider of that, really want to do that, because they’ll find out they’re getting a pretty good deal,” said Supervisor John Benoit at the Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday.\nThis is a point consistently made by Sheriff Stan Sniff, who says city police forces won’t be able to compete with the level of services from the Sheriff’s Department due to economies of scale. The Eastvale City Council seems to have come to this view as well, voting Monday to drop out of a feasibility study with the cities looking at alternatives to current services.\nMeanwhile, the San Jacinto City Council decided Tuesday to create a public safety committee to study the feasibility of either a joint police force with other cities or bringing back the San Jacinto Police Department. Five members of the committee will be chosen from the public, and residents are encouraged to apply.\nThese sorts of studies and reviews may turn up a reluctant endorsement of contracting with the county. But it is important that city governments look for cost-effective options. Contract cities should be mindful of the fact that most of the cost problems boil down to the Board of Supervisors approving generous contracts with Sheriff’s Department unions. With Sheriff’s Department contracts up for negotiation beginning next year, cities should pressure the board to stay disciplined.\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
