PETERSBURG, Fla. — College of Charleston senior sailor and team captain Beka Schiff won the SAISA Women’s Singlehanded Championship regatta on Sunday. Sailing in four races and tallying the lowest score (five points), Schiff advanced to nationals for the third year in a row, but this time with a SAISA title in hand. This year’s ICSA Men’s and Women’s Singlehanded Championships will be held on Nov. 6-8 and hosted by Old Dominion in Norfolk, Va. Schiff also crewed A-Division with sophomore skipper Elizabeth Pemberton as the College of Charleston women were runner-up at the SAISA Women’s Fall Dinghy event. A competitive day of racing left the Cougars just 12 points out of first place. Junior skipper Nikki Medley and senior crew Michaela Reynolds also contributed to the team’s finish with both sailing in B-Division. The venue for the inter-conference events moved to south Florida after weather conditions caused by Hurricane Joaquin were unsuitable for originally scheduled competition at the J. Stewart Walker Sailing Complex in Mount Pleasant. Up ahead, the Cougars will compete at the North Points No. 4 regatta hosted by UNCW on Oct. 10 in Wilmington, N.C., the Larchmont Offshore Invite on Oct. 9-11 in Larchmont, N.Y., and the Navy Fall Women’s event hosted by Navy on Oct. 10-11 in Annapolis, Md.
