The mistake put Oklahoma State at the Longhorn 10 with 36 seconds left. Junior kicker Ben Grogan nailed the 41-yard game-winning field goal to seal a 30-27 win for the Cowboys..\n\"We have to play better and just learn how to finish,\" Strong said. \"We just can't finish right now. We got to learn how to finish and fight through it. We sat there with a three-point lead and probably shouldn't have got the call I got, but I got upset and got to learn to you to just control my composure we just got to be able to bounce back.\"\nStrong on the unsportsmanlike penalty called on the sideline\n\"That's what is surprising, because you think about it, the play before we got the interference call, and the very next play you get a defensive holding call, and they run the football. I've never heard of that. In all my years of coaching, I've never seen that so I thought it was holding on them, so I was clapping thinking we were going to barely take them back, and then the guy said it was a defensive holding call, and I said, 'On a run play on the offense, that cannot happen.'\"\nStrong on regrouping after the last two losses\n\"I said 'It's all about being able to pick yourself back up. You're going to get knocked down but you have to battle through. We're not going to give up, and we have a lot of games left to go play so keep playing guys.'\"\nStrong on the defensive performance\n\"Well, you look at it, and it's all about getting turnovers, and we got some turnovers and were able to get pressure on their quarterback.\"\nSenior offensive guard Kent Perkins on Texas' 1-3 record\n\"You look at it - both games we were inches away from a win. In my opinion, that's what makes it more frustrating. You lose a game by huge margins ... like alright, we lost the game.\"\nJunior defensive tackle Hassan Ridgeway on the penalties\n\"I was very surprised. Some of the calls, like the holding call against Poona [Ford], I didn't see a holding call. They held us all of the time, so how did we get a holding call like that?\nSenior running back Johnathan Gray on the locker room's morale\n\"Everybody is just mad at how we have been losing for the past two weeks. We don't want to lose like this. We were just picking guys up and everybody still has a positive mind.\"\nJunior safety Dylan Haines on moving forward\n\"We have a good football team. You can look at us and say we're a 1-3 team, but that's not where we are and that's not where we're anywhere close to where we'll be at the end of the season.\"\nNo. 24 Oklahoma State 30, at Texas 27\nFull coverage Five thoughts: Late-game mistake hurts Texas in 30-27 loss to Oklahoma State\nTexas quotable: 'We just can't finish right now'\nNot again!
