There is no part of of my mind that comprehends what it was. I have no clue what they were trying to do, and they did not do whatever they were trying to do well. \nLet us look upon the horror: \nAlright, let's analyze what happened here. \nIndianapolis faced 4th-and-3 on their 37-yard-line, and came out in a punt formation, as might be expected. Then the majority of the players in the punt formation -- including the entire offensive line and punter -- ran over to the right side of the field. \nThat left just two people under the ball: The gunner from the top of the field, wide receiver Griff Whalen, who turned into a de facto center, and the gunner from the bottom of the field, safety Colt Anderson, who turned into a de facto QB. The punt crew remained in a shell of a punt formation. \nIf the Colts were trying to catch the Pats off guard, it did not work: They lined up perfectly fine. However, the Colts snapped the ball anyway. It did not work. \nIt turned into an unblocked QB sneak with two players running into three players. Anderson tries his best, but he's quickly gang-tackled. Whalen snaps the ball and doesn't realize he's supposed to block for a good second there. \nPiecing together the evidence, it's clear Whalen wasn't supposed to hike the ball when he did. As you can see, the ball kinda hangs up in his butt for a second as Anderson wasn't prepared to take it. Look at how baffled the other nine Colts on the field are: \n\"Huh? Why is football happening now?\" \nCameras caught Pagano wondering saying \"WHY'D YOU SNAP THAT\" to Whalen: \nWhatever this play was supposed to be, I doubt it was supposed to involve nine people completely motionless. It seems more than likely Whalen messed up by snapping the ball, and Anderson's best improvisation was to run forward, which didn't work. \nBut even if there was a good idea here, it wouldn't have worked, because here was a penalty called on the play. THE ENTIRE RIGHT SIDE of the Colts' offense failed to line up on the line of scrimmage. (You need seven guys on the line.) \nThe Patriots used the short field provided by the botched play to score a touchdown and take a 13-point lead. \nAt its core, the reason for the massive failure boils down to one huge error: The ball was snapped too early. That explains the complete ineffectiveness of the play and the confused teammates and coaches. \nBut nothing else happening makes sense either. I don't know what the Colts were setting up. I don't know what the purpose of their formation was. I don't know why they thought it would work. I don't know why they failed to line up in a legal formation. I don't know why the best option if it didn't work was a guy running into three guys. \nWashington ran a similar-looking formation resulting in an awful play a few years back , where a field goal unit shifted all at once. But at least that ended in a semi-coherent, albeit poorly executed pass. The Colts ended up with nothing resembling football. \nThis was a disgusting bouillabaise of terrible ideas and terrible execution, and I am a worse human for having witnessed it.
