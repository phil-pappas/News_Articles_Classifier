So, don't think that the Aggies didn't recognize the difference in their 56-14 rout of Fresno State last weekend.\nUtah State went six for six for TDs in the red zone and put up its highest point total on the road since 1997 without even attempting a field goal.\n\"The last couple of weeks we have really been emphasizing red zone offense, but we haven’t been scoring touchdowns in the red zone,\" USU center Austin Stephens said. \"This past weekend, our defense did a great job on setting us up and getting turnovers for us down there, so it made our job really easy. We got the ball inside Fresno State’s 10-yard line a few times, and that’s just really good for an offense and really easy to punch it in.\n\"To be able to score touchdowns instead of field goals is really important and that’s one of our goals each week, is to hit a certain percentage of what we do in the red zone to get a certain amount of points. To be able to punch in touchdowns is always nice for an offense to do and it makes for a good day.”\nWhile the Aggies rushed for 201 yards on 43 carries, they racked up seven touchdowns on the ground. Backup Damion Hobbs scored once and USU running backs Devante Mays (three), LaJuan Hunt (two) and Justen Hervey (one) combined for a half-dozen TDs.\nConsidering what Aggie tailbacks did on the ground last year, Saturday's effort at Fresno State was pretty epic. In 2014, Utah State totaled 22 rushing touchdowns on its way to 10 victories. However, only seven of those were recorded by true running backs.\nJoe Hill finished with four TDs, while Rashad Hall added two and Hunt one. Quarterbacks Kent Myers (five), Darell Garretson (two) and Chuckie Keeton (one) accounted for eight themselves, while wide receivers JoJo Natson (three) and Devonte Robinson (one) totaled four more. The final three TDs came courtesy of linebacker-turned-tailback Nick Vigil.\n“It was a really big step forward in the confidence factor for our guys, and I can attribute it to one thing: we ran the ball well,\" USU head coach Matt Wells said of the running game at Fresno.\n\"We were good on first down, and we ran the ball well. That’s why we didn’t fall behind the chains. We found ways to run the football into the end zone.”\nAN EVEN DOZEN: History was not on USU's side heading into the game at Fresno State. The Aggies had dropped six straight to the Bulldogs and hadn't won at Bulldog Stadium since 1980.\nBut Utah State, which also won at BYU last season for the first time since 1978, will have to buck an even bigger historical trend Friday when Boise State comes to Logan. The Aggies are 4-15 all-time against the Broncos, including a pesky 12-game losing streak at the hands of their rivals from the Big West, WAC and Mountain West conferences.\nBoise State is 7-2 in games played in Logan, with the Aggies' last win over the Broncos coming on Nov. 1, 1997, via a 24-20 victory at Romney Stadium. That was Houston Nutt's one and only season as the head coach at Boise State, while it was John L. Smith's third and final season at Utah State.\nGETTING BETTER: The Aggies' offense is apparently on the way up. After opening the season by scoring 12 points in an ugly win over Southern Utah, USU scored 14 and 17 points, respectively, in losses at Utah and Washington. Utah State then racked up 33 points vs. Colorado State before posting 56 points in last weekend's rout at Fresno State.\nOf course, it seems highly unlikely that the Aggie offense will be able to continue that upward trend Friday night against Boise State. The Broncos, who are currently seventh in the country in total defense at 12.0 points per game, have given up 57 points or more just once since 1998, and that came in an epic, 69-67 four-overtime win over Nevada.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team100.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:14:06.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
