The Ice Bears fell behind 2-1 until Zack Larue, a rookie out of UMass-Amherst, tied the game 5:06 into the second period.\nMississippi scored the final two goals of the second to take a 4-2 lead, but Larue scored again quickly into the third period and Lou Educate, who played nine games for the Ice Bears last season, forced overtime with a goal.\nRookie Garrett Sheehan was in goal for Knoxville. He made 30 saves on 34 shots.\nWith the exhibition slate over, Knoxville has four days off before its season opener Friday at Macon. The home opener is Saturday against Columbus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:43:09.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
