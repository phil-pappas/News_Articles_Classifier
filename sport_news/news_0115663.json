Walnut Grove’s leading pass receiver this year is junior Dashun Smith, who has recorded 32 catches for 325 yards, about 11 yard average per reception.On defense, Eagle’s Landing is being paced by a trio of players.Junior cornerback Cameron Miller has 15 solo tackles in six games while junior cornerback Tre Sherman has compiled 12 solos in five games.In addition, Eagle senior middle linebacker Reggie McBride has 17 solo and three assist tackles while senior defensive tackle Martel Waugh has 17 solos stops, four assists for a total of 19 tackles.Walnut Grove’s defense is led by five tacklers, part of the attacking defense Jones described.In six games, sophomore linebacker Conner Hicks has stymied opposing offensive units, having amassed 71 total tackles in six games, including 35 solo stops and 36 assists.In addition, Walnut Grove has four other defensive standouts with whom Eagle’s Landing will have to block as much as possible.They include sophomore defensive end Javarious Phillips, who has 55 total tackles, while sophomore linebacker Mike Smith has 35.
