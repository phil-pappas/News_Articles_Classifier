I've always believed in my ability. I know the gift I have at rushing a quarterback and I never let anybody tell me I can't do something. At the age of 27, I'm still continuing to prove people wrong. \n\"You live and you learn. When you feel like you have regrets, you're not putting your all into what you're doing. I could easily have regrets about being cut by the 49ers. I had a sack in the pre-season. You keep pressing forward. You have to feel blessed for the opportunity. I try to look at it and thank God for every door he's opened for me. It's tough. But when you get rejected, what are you going to do? Are you going to sit down and be proud about it or are you going to find another way? I keep pressing forward to try and make a living.\" \nAfter being released by the Steelers in July, Lemon contacted all the other NFL teams, asking for a shot, an opportunity to prove himself, a chance to show he's every bit as good as he showed last season for the Calgary Stampeders when he had 13 sacks, an interception and eight forced fumbles, which tied a CFL record. \n\"I go back to the drawing board,\" said Lemon. \"I always try to have a next plan. What's next? The key is persistence. I understand how to make phone calls, I know how to market a player, I've made my own highlight film. \n\"Nobody's going to work as hard for you to sell you as you would for yourself. It's good to have an agent to do that as well, but it's also good to do it on your own. In life, you're going to deal with adversity where you're going to go through stuff in the real world. I tend to just get up and keep pressing forward.\" \nThe persistence, the never-quit attitude are qualities he carries from football into the real world. \n\"It fits the DNA for the position I play,\" said Lemon. \"I use it in life. Just keep rushing, all you need is that one big play, that one big job, to push you over the top.\" \nDuring his final high school season at West Lake High School in Waldorf, Md, Lemon, who was putting up big stats rushing the quarterback, had no scholarship offers in hand -- until the final game of the season when he lined up against offensive lineman Phil Taylor, a 2011 NFL first-round draft pick (Cleveland Browns). Lemon had three sacks (he had 21 on the season) and got offers from UConn, Cincinnati and Akron, where he wound up. \n\"Going into my final high school season, there were three players on my team who already had scholarships,\" said Lemon. \"I left my last high school game not knowing if I'd get a scholarship.\" \nHe had a big senior season in college and, undrafted in the NFL, wound up in the CFL -- going through stops in Winnipeg, Saskatchewan and Edmonton before Calgary hit the jackpot. In between there were also stops in arena and indoor football -- in San Jose, Orlando and Sioux Falls. \n\"(In Calgary), we won a Grey Cup and I was nominated for defensive player of the year,\" said Lemon. \"I had a D co-ordinator, Coach (Rich) Stubler, we just meshed well. Coach Stubler, he's still a good friend of mine, he helped me grow as a player and understand the schemes.\" \nWhen the Stampeders released him after the season so he could pursue NFL opportunities, Lemon had 14 visits, with teams looking at him as a linebacker. \n\"I thought Pittsburgh was a good fit for me so I cancelled three visits,\" said Lemon, whose chances took a hit when the Steelers drafted linebacker Bud Dupree in the first round and he was cut early in August. \"I came into training camp with tendinitis in my Achilles. It's weird because now it doesn't bother me. It's all about timing. I could have went into the tank there, but I kept pushing forward.\" \nHe lasted three weeks with the 49ers and set his sights on the CFL with several teams interested. He signed with the RedBlacks early last month. In Ottawa, he has seven tackles and two sacks. \n\"This is the third team I've been on this year,\" said Lemon. \"So I've learned three playbooks. You try to come in and not be Superman, you play within the scheme of the defence and add on to the good things that they've already done. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't tough to not try and be what I was last year. That's not what the team here needs me to do, they already have production. I just try and come in and continue to add to the success. \n\"I'm fine with it. I still have a chance to make plays. Last week I had a sack called back and I got some pretty good pressure on the quarterback. I just have to adapt to a new scheme.\" \nAs much as there's a learning curve with a new playbook, it's also important to fit in within the walls of a new locker room. \n\"Every locker room is very unique and has its own direction,\" said Lemon, who is signed through 2016. \"The Pittsburgh locker room was different from the San Francisco locker room and the San Francisco locker room was different than the Ottawa locker room. You just have to go in and be a professional and know you're being paid to be a professional.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:51:57.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
