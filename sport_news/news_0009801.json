It terrified fantasy owners and Vikings fans because if he was sick he might not play.\nTurns out Peterson vomited because he swallowed his chew on a bumpy plane ride. No, really. \nPer FOX broadcast, Adrian Peterson swallowed his chew on a bumpy team flight Saturday. Vomited upon arrival. Hence, injury report downgrade.\nâ€” Kevin Seifert (@SeifertESPN) October 25, 2015 This is easily the grossest reason to vomit ever. \nFew things are as nasty as chewing tobacco and nothing's grosser than swallowing chewing tobacco. \nTheoretically the Vikings had to list him when he vomited (as we understand it), what with the requirements of the injury reports (or at least it wouldn't be worth it not to report). \nThe hardest thing to understand is how you could be on a plane ride so bumpy the chewing tobacco flew out of your lip/cheek and down your throat. \n\nAP gacked over chewing tobacco.
