EAST RUTHERFORD – Not long after the Giants signed Shane Vereen, Eli Manning hustled into the office of offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo, eager to hear his game plan.\n\"As a quarterback, you get excited just seeing what he did in the Super Bowl,\" Manning said of Vereen, who caught 11 Tom Brady passes to help the Patriots beat the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX eight months ago.\nBuy this photo \"You see what he can do as a pass-catching running back, and it was fun to talk with Coach McAdoo, getting some ideas as far as how do you use that? Routes and ideas, having a plan and special plays for him to utilize his skill set.\n\"He's obviously a playmaker.\"\nThat much has been clear from the moment Manning and Vereen stepped on the field together, with the most significant evidence coming on the final drive of the Giants' 30-27 victory over the 49ers last week.\nManning took the field at his 18-yard line with 1:41 to play and the Giants needing a touchdown to win. Odell Beckham Jr. and Rueben Randle were on the sideline dealing with hamstring issues. Dwayne Harris, rookie Geremy Davis and Myles White — who was on the practice squad the first month of the season — were in the huddle.\nIn stepped Vereen, who caught passes for 11, 16 and 24 yards to help the Giants get to the 49ers' 20 with 30 seconds to play.\nHe accounted for 51 of the 82 yards on the game-winning possession that ended with a Manning-to-Larry Donnell touchdown strike.\nVereen is the first Giants running back to catch 20 passes through the first five games of the season since 2007 (Derrick Ward).\nNo Giants running back has reached 60 catches since Tom Coughlin took over as head coach in 2004. A year before, Tiki Barber had 69.\nBeckham is expected to play tonight against the Eagles despite being listed as questionable with a tight hamstring that led him to miss practice Thursday and Friday. He is one of two players on the offense for whom defensive coordinators must prepare at all times, Vereen being the other.\n\"The defense may in fact think they've got you in a position where they have the upper hand, and someone like Shane can determine that might not necessarily be so,\" Coughlin said of Vereen, who signed a three-year, $12.4 million deal with the Giants. \"Have we ever had a player like this, to be able to utilize his talents? Probably not to this degree.\"\nVereen also happens to know how to win, considering he's one of two players in the locker room – linebacker Jonathan Casillas is the other – who held the Vince Lombardi Trophy back in February.\n\"Keep your head down and keep grinding,\" Vereen said of the Giants' current three-game winning streak. \"We still have a long way to go. Long, long season ahead of us. We really are just getting started, really just getting started in the season. So we still have a lot to improve on, take it week to week, and like I said, we've got Philadelphia [tonight] at Philly. Big game.\n\"Can't wait for that. It's going to be a good test for us.\"\nJPP TO BE RECHECKED THIS WEEK: The post-Labor Day expectation was that Jason Pierre-Paul would return to East Rutherford in six weeks for reexamination, and that reportedly will happen this week, possibly as soon as Tuesday.\nWhether Pierre-Paul stays with the team this time remains to be seen.\nThe maximum value of the franchise tag set aside for the unsigned Pierre-Paul will be reduced from $14.813 million to $9.587 million after tonight's game.\nThere is doubt about how effective Pierre-Paul will be on the field following the July 4 fireworks accident that ended up costing him his right index finger and part of his right thumb.\nPierre-Paul and the Giants will have to negotiate a compromise on the price for his one-year deal. A contract must be signed by Nov. 17, or Pierre-Paul would be declared out for the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:44.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
