So there was Van Gundy — with his wife, Kim — mingling with Titans fans and telling stories of the days when he and McCallum shared an office.\n\"Tonight is more about friendship,\" Van Gundy said. \"My son (Michael) goes to school here, but Ray's been great to my son, Ray's always been great to me. He's one of the nicest people in the business and a damn good coach working his butt off to turn this around, so I was glad to do it.\n\"Plus, I knew it would be fun, and it was.\"\nMichael is a junior at UDM and working with the basketball staff.\nPistons coach Stan Van Gundy at the UDM basketball fund-raiser (Photo: Vince Ellis DFP)\n■ Morris update: A motion to remand a felony aggravated assault case against Pistons forward Marcus Morris and his brother, Markieff, to a new grand jury was taken under advisement by a Maricopa County Superior Court judge in Phoenix. Judge Joan Sinclair heard more than an hour of arguments but said she will need to read more transcripts before making a ruling soon. A new court date was set for Nov. 5. The Morris twins and three other men face two felony aggravated assault charges for a January incident in which a man was assaulted outside a Phoenix gymnasium where a club basketball tournament was being played. The victim, a past Philadelphia acquaintance of the Morris twins, suffered a broken nose, bruises and cuts. Markieff Morris plays for the Suns.\nContact Vince Ellis at vellis@freepress.com .
