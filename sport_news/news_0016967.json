It's the most important thing so I have to appeal,\" Mourinho said.\n\"The moment we got the written reasons and I decided to appeal is the moment to stop with my opinions and not to add anything more than I did already.\n\"I think I was very objective in my sadness facing the situation.\"\nMourinho on Thursday night addressed the sanction, which was announced by the FA on Wednesday.\n\"Every word I say is a big risk for me,\" he said on Thursday.\n\"I am happy that I don't have an electronic tag. I think it's not far from (that).\n\"I also think that £50,000 in the world where we live today is an absolute disgrace.\n\"And I also think that the possibility of getting a stadium ban is also something absolutely astonishing.\"\nThe stadium ban will be imposed if Mourinho speaks out of turn in the next 12 months, but it is understood the FA is unlikely to pursue Thursday night's comments.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:34:30.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
