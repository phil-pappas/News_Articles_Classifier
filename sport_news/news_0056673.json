That is the difference between those stars and other players.\n\"We are far from having our best numbers in that facet of the game in general from the whole team since the start of the season, but that will change for sure, I don't have any doubt.\"\nBarca have now lost two of their last three league games and can be passed by either Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid in the table when the capital city rivals face each other on Sunday.\nAnd Enrique refused to take any solace in the fact that his side had dominated large spells of the game despite being shorn of Andres Iniesta as well as Messi.\n\"There is no one that can be happy at Barca when you lose. It doesn't matter that we created a lot of chances. The objective is always to win and if you don't you cannot be happy.\"\nSuarez insisted that his boss hadn't given him or Neymar any special instructions on how to cope without Messi and admitted his culpability in passing up a series of first-half chances to put the visitors in front.\n\"We did enough to at least not lose the game,\" said the Uruguayan.\n\"In the first-half was when we missed our chance to go in front. They started the second-half very quickly. We reacted enough to get back into the game at 2-1 and had a lot of shots from outside the area that were blocked, but we did all we could to not lose the game.\n\"They scored a great first goal and you have to give credit to the opponents as well. The second one surprised us a bit more.\n\"The team showed its character in a difficult moment to try and turn the game around.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-04T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:18:27.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
