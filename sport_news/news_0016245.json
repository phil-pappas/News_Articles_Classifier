They even stay in a hotel the night before games in Philadelphia and Long Island. \nBut staying in a New York City hotel Saturday night before facing the New York Rangers Sunday is new. Even for the playoffs during Lou Lamoriello's term as GM the Devils stayed in a New Jersey hotel the night before. \n\"I's different. It's a good way to get into this rivalry,\" said center Travis Zajac, who is hopeful of playing as he battles a lower body issue. \"These are big games, at least to some of the guys who have been here. The new guys will find that out. I think it's a good test for us.\" \nIs there a playoff type atmosphere even for an early-season game? \n\"When Ray (Shero) came in and we were looking through the schedule it was an opportunity. We don't get opportunities early in the season to be on the road together,\" coach John Hynes explained. \"It's a little more building team togetherness than it is anything else. \n\"It's an opportunity for the guys, it being a one o'clock game. You wake up after having a good night's sleep in the hotel. Have breakfast. They can walk to the arena. It's less hectic than coming back and forth on a game day.\" \nRELATED: How many games will the Devils win this season? \nKyle Palmieri , who'll play in his first Devils-Rangers game that counts, said this is nothing new. The Anaheim Ducks always stayed in a hotel the night before a road game, even in Los Angeles. \n\"I guess it's different for teams in the East. We always stayed in a hotel out west,\" Palmieri said. \"It's something I'm used to. It's more of an adjustment for guys that haven't done it in the past. For me it's what I've always done. \n\"In L.A. we were always in the night before. When you put traffic into it, it's about the same ride.\" \nAdam Henrique likes the idea. \n\"It's just new. Another little thing. It's the first time I'll be staying over there,\" Henrique said. \"I think it will be good. Go over, settle in and just kind of relax and not worry about anything tomorrow. An afternoon game is different, too.\" \nFor Cory Schneider, who'll start in goal against Henrik Lundqvist, sleep is sleep no matter where it is. After the birth of son Wyatt on Tuesday, he's just catching up on his sleep. \n\"(It will be) pretty low key,\" Schneider promised. \"I'll probably get to bed early. I'm pretty tired.\" \n* * *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:55:03.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
