The Vols will honor seniors Ferguson, Gabby Santorio, and goalkeeper Julie Eckel at the game.\n\"It's crazy,\" Ferguson said Thursday. \"I distinctly remember my freshman year thinking, ‘I've got so much time here.' Everyone's telling me it goes by fast, and I'm like, ‘Nah, I have plenty of time.'\n\"Now I'm looking at my last weekend playing at Regal, and I'm like, ‘Wow, I'm old.' \"\nTennessee (7-4-5, 3-4-2 SEC), coming off Friday's 2-0 home loss to No. 13 Ole Miss, is tied for ninth in the SEC standings with Kentucky (9-5-3, 3-4-2).\nThe Vols finish the regular season Thursday at sixth-place South Carolina (11-4-1, 5-3-1). The top 10 teams in the conference standings reach the conference tournament.\n\"We need to get some wins,\" Ferguson said. \"They're all good RPI opportunities and will help us in the NCAA (selection process), especially with SEC standings the way they are with everyone right up there with each other.\"\nFerguson has been one of UT's most consistent contributors during her four-year career. She has played in 76 of 79 games and started 55.\nAs a freshman, Ferguson played in all but one of the Vols' 22 games, started three, and averaged 34.4 minutes.\nHer playing time has increased each year.\n\"I'm really competitive,\" Ferguson said. \"I just wanted to come in and get the opportunity to play. I just wanted to get minutes on the field. Obviously, playing as a freshman is hard, so I was really happy with my playing time then. I just worked hard, I guess.\"\nHer college career wasn't always a given.\nWhile at Washington & Lee High School in Arlington, Ferguson wasn't sure she wanted to play college soccer, and if she did, wasn't sure at what level.\nFerguson had her best year of high school soccer as a senior when she had 22 goals and nine assists, but remained uncommitted at Christmas break that year.\nBrian Pensky heard about Ferguson three weeks after he was hired as UT's coach in early February of 2012.\nOne of Ferguson's coaches from club soccer called from Northern Virginia and gave Pensky the recruiting tip. Ferguson came to a UT camp in March of 2012 and got an offer.\nFerguson, who played mostly forward in high school and club, has played outside midfield, attacking midfield, and outside back (defense) for the Vols. She's settled into her spot on defense for her senior year.\n\"For Susan's first three years, she was our best utility player,\" Pensky said. \"Wherever we had a hole, that's where Susan's going to go. She didn't love the role. She wanted a place to stay. … Thankfully, this year we've just put her here as a right back. We've kind of granted her that wish that she deserves.\"\nIt will be an emotional time Sunday when the three seniors are recognized.\nFerguson and Santorio have been roommates since their freshman year and are good friends.\n\"We're really close, and I'm really close with Julie (Eckel), too,\" Ferguson said. \"We've always been close. Especially it started (Eckel's) sophomore year, my freshman year when I came in. We got closer when (Eckel) decided to stay for her fifth year last spring.\"\nDave Link is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:03:27.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
