He's playing really well. He's playing at a high level, and we've got a lot of confidence in him.\" \nHoyer made his second start this season on Sunday and it was the first time he both started and finished a game. \nHe won the starting job out of camp, but was benched during the season opener after struggling early in that game. But Mallett had a tough time in his three starts and Hoyer took over in the last two of them before regaining the starting job last week. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
