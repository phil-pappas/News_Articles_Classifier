He is an emotional player and I don't think he was disrespectful in any way,\" said Martinez. \n\"Sometimes as a player when they keep hitting you with every chance they get, sometimes you are going to feel the challenge comes your way and maybe you are going to go to ground that little bit easier. \n\"Maybe he has to learn that, but it is difficult as a striker or an attacking player to cope with the amount of bad treatment you get from defenders.\" \nDeulofeu, though, almost had the last laugh when given a late sight of goal, but his snapshot was beaten away by Petr Cech as the Gunners held out for victory. \nMartinez said: \"Gerard has incredible talent, he worries defenders and you could see at the end they had three players around him. He carries that threat. \n\"He is a young player and he has a lot to learn but he has the desire and that winning mentality and it's only a matter of time before he puts that talent together.\" \nEverton will asses the knee injury suffered by captain Phil Jagielka in a challenge with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, which could see the England defender set for an extended spell on the sidelines. \n\"Phil is a fit man and maybe that action in another player would have hurt him more,\" said Martinez. \n\"It is his right knee, his toe gets twisted and that can affect the structure underneath and it could be a nasty one.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:24:51.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
