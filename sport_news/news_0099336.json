Tyrah Bell made 12 saves for the Tigers, who finished 11-7-1 and rebounded from a difficult middle of the season to claim a sectional championship. \nYorktown coach Tim Ashton said the Tigers actually didn't play poorly, they were just overmatched against defending state champion Fishers, which is 14-3-2 this season. And it didn't take away from the team doing what it set out to do in the preseason. \n\"They set the goal of winning the sectional at the beginning of the year, and that's what we really worked towards,\" Ashton said. \"We didn't want to settle for that, but we also knew the reality going into regionals. I'm really proud of them, they got better throughout the season.\" \nJunior Lizzie Smith finished the season with 20 goals and 15 assists for the Tigers while senior Sarah Bade ended her high school career with 15 goals and senior Katie Nixon 11. Hannah Rapp will be one of the Tigers' top returnees after tallying 14 goals and 10 assists as a sophomore. \nColumbus East 1, New Castle 0 \nThe Trojans fell in the East Central Regional semifinals Wednesday night, finishing the season 17-2. Columbus East improved to 10-4-5. \nOlivia Malott finished her senior campaign with 28 goals and 13 assists for New Castle, which had won its last six. Senior Emily Peavie closed the season with 16 goals and 12 assists while Delanee Frye (11) and Calissa Centner (10) also hit double-figure goals in their final prep seasons.
