The 20-year-old Indian failed to stop the resurgent former world No.1 in the 47-minute battle. Sindhu, who demolished three top rankers including the reigning world champion Carolina Marin in the last three days, looked good when she led 16-10 in the first game. \n\nIt was here the lanky shuttler committed three net faults allowing Xuerui to make a comeback. The experienced Xuerui seized the opportunity. Sindhu should have varied her attack here. Rather than continuing in the smashing mode, the unseeded Indian should have tried the half smashes. Xuerui, who is the defending champion, first reduced the lead to 13-16 and then with another five-point burst went ahead to 18-17.
