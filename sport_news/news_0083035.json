He is facing investigation on those charges. \nWorawi is also appealing against a suspended 16-month jail term for forgery offences surrounding the FAT elections in 2013. \nThe normalization committee's task of reviewing the FAT's electoral system could erode Worawi's powerbase within Thai football. The electoral suffrage in FAT elections had been disputed in the past, as the majority of votes lie with clubs in the top tiers of the local league, many of whom are beholden to the political status quo. \nAdmiral Surawut Maharom, who has been appointed as the head of the normalization committee, said he would consider reforms \"in the best interests of the country.\" \n\"I'm the kind of person who will not let anyone interfere in my job,\" Admiral Surawut was quoted to say by Thai media on Saturday. \"Complying with FIFA is something we need to do, otherwise we would not be a part of the world community.\" \nHowever Narinpong Jinapak, lawyer for the FAT, placed doubt upon the scope of the normalization committee. He was quoted to say the new committee's role was \"only to supervise\" the next election and that it should not \"become involved in or interfere in the FAT's administration.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:34:08.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
