More than 90 percent of injuries occurred from April through October, with the peak in July, the researchers found.\nThe leading causes of injuries were falls (77 percent) and collisions (13 percent), including those with trees and other structures used to anchor zip lines.\nThe most common types of injuries were broken bones (46 percent), bruises (15 percent), strains/sprains (15 percent) and concussions/closed head injuries (7 percent). Eleven percent of patients with zip line injuries were admitted to the hospital, according to the study published Oct. 5 in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine .\nA zip line is a pulley attached to a cable that's usually made of stainless steel. The cable is suspended above an incline that allows the user to use gravity to slide from the top of the cable to the bottom.\nThe number of commercial zip lines in the United States grew from 10 in 2001 to more than 200 in 2012, and there are more than 13,000 amateur zip lines in outdoor education programs, camps and backyards, according to the study.\nMore information\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about sports injuries .\nCopyright Â© 2015 HealthDay .
