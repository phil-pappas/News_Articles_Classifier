STARKVILLE, MISS -- This much we know about Starkville, Mississippi: \nAdding a stadium full of clanging cowbells dos NOT enhance the presentation of “Sandstorm;” \nMSU has done the best job of any school in the Southeastern Conference of refurbishing its stadium; \nDavis Wade Stadium is home to Dak Prescott, who may just be the best quarterback in the SEC. \nAll of it was apparent Saturday night as the Bulldogs tore apart Kentucky, Prescott carving it up like a big blue Christmas ham. \nWhen the Wildcats tried to pressure him, he ran away from them. When they gave him time, he sprayed the football over and through Kentucky’s defense. When they spread out to stop everybody else, he ran. And ran. And then ran some more. \n“He’s seen everything. He’s seen it all in this league,” said Mark Stoops, who did almost everything he could to keep his team in the game. Almost. Stoops admitted to one major gaffe that might have been the difference. \nIt began inside the final five minutes of the first half, the Wildcats down 14-10. They owned the football, which meant two good things - they could score and Prescott was on the sidelines. \nKentucky picked up two first downs, taking it to the State 31. But after three straight Towles incompletions, the Wildcats saw Austin MacGinnis miss a field goal try from 48 yards out. \nPrescott needed only five plays and 87 seconds to move the Bulldogs 69 yards for a touchdown and a 21-10 lead. \nAs the Dogs were beating up his players, Stoops was beating himself up inside. \n“I was telling (offensive coordinator) Shannon Dawson, I want to get out of this half. I know how explosive (MSU) is,” he said. “I wanted to run it and get some first downs, grind it out and get three or, the best case scenario, seven. You gotta match some scores with them because you know they’re gonna score.” \nInstead, they were down 11. “The game got away from us right there,” Stoops said. \nKentucky drove again, forced to pass this time. With less than 90 seconds left, they did what they’ve done as well as any team in the conference this season – they went deep. Towles fired long and high down the right sideline, only not quite deep enough. He underthrew just enough to where Taveze Calhoun could make a leaping interception. Now it was Towles on the sideline and Prescott going back to work. \nThat may be the wrong term. It looked like anything but work as he dropped back and hit Brandon Holloway, wide open in the left flat. Safety A.J. Stamps made a late run at him but Holloway shook him like old alfalfa and raced 60 yards to the MSU 20. Two plays later, Prescott bolted for the end zone and a 28- 10 lead. \nKentcky managed an answer, however meek, by driving for a field goal with three seconds left in the half to make it 28-13 at intermission. As he headed for the locker room, Stoops told the UK radio network that the last few minutes of the second quarter were “bad game management by me.” \nThings got better in the last two periods but not by much. The UK defense held the Dogs to a single touchdown in each quarter, but the Cats managed just a field goal in the third. It should have been seven.They had a golden chance at a second touchdown of their own when they drove to the State five-yard line, but that’s where offensive lineman Cole Mosier blocked a Bulldog D-lineman all the way to the stadium turf, and then tried to plant him there with an extra shot to the head. Flags flew, the Wildcats moved backward 15 yards and what could have been a TD to make it just a seven-point game instead was a field goal that simply kept things close for a little while longer. \nKentucky sacked Prescott only once and never really threatened on too many other occasions. He could have sat in a lawn chair waiting for his tall, talented receivers to get open, abusing Kentucky’s young defensive backs, who covered as long as they could. It just didn’t matter. \nThe Wildcats rang up 30 first downs and rolled for 423 total yards -- child’s play, compared to Prescott and State, which piled up 586 yards of total offense, Prescott accounting for 117 on the ground (plus three touchdowns) and 348 in the air (plus three touchdowns). \n“They coached better, they played better and it starts with that guy,” Stoops said. “Dak’s a heck of a football player.” \nThe Bulldogs are on their way to their sixth consecutive bowl game under Dan Mullen, who’s never lost to Kentucky as a head coach. They couldn’t hang one on him when he was the offensive coordinator at Florida, either. \nThere, he had a dual threat quarterback named Tim Tebow, who played on a pair of national title teams – first as a backup, then as the starter who scored himself a Heisman trophy. \nPrescott finished eighth in the voting last year, thanks to MSU sitting atop the polls undefeated for five weeks. He likely won’t be a finalist this season, what with the Dogs losing a couple of games already. \nBut, it says here, Prescott is better than Tebow. He’s not surrounded by the kind of talent the Gators had back then and his team won’t even win an SEC title, must less a national championship. \nStill, he just might be the best player in the history of MSU football and on a muggy night in Starkville, he schooled a young Kentucky team that was all too glad to leave the cowbells behind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:21:27.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
