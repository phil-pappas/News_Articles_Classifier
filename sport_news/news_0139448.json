His eruption enabled Caulder to finish with 356 passing yards and five total touchdowns, including four through the air. \n“I just wanted to come out in the second half, stay focused and keep my composure,” Moore said. “I knew I wasn’t going to come out and just drastically get yards. I remained steady and let the plays come to me.” \nFairmont (7-2, 4-1), Red Springs (7-2, 3-2) and South Columbus (4-5, 4-1) — all 2-A teams — entered Friday in a three-way tie for second place behind 1-A Whiteville in the split-classification Three Rivers Conference. The win by the Tornadoes, who ran out the final 3:03 after Halijah McLean recovered a fumble near midfield, gives them the inside track to finishing second in the league and earning its top 2-A seed for the playoffs. \nRonald Alexander rushed for 191 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Red Devils, scoring on a 4-yard run to help push them ahead 20-14 midway through the third quarter. Twenty-six seconds later, Caulder rolled right on a play from the Red Springs 46 and released a deep throw moments before being leveled from behind. \nMoore, who wasn’t among the five Fairmont players who caught a first-half pass, hauled in Caulder’s throw for a go-ahead touchdown. \n“At the break, he told me, ’If you scramble and can’t find anybody, just throw it up to me — I’ve got your back,’ “ Caulder said. “I didn’t even see him catch it. I just heard the crowd, got up and ran quickly to the end zone. At the last minute I saw him wide-open and just threw it as far as I could. It was a good hit, too.” \nRed Springs’ next series ended with Oliver Brooks tackling Cody Freeman near midfield on an unsuccessful faked punt, and Moore’s 40-yard gain on a receiver screen set up Caulder’s 2-yard touchdown run on a fourth-and-goal keeper to open the fourth quarter. \nA two-point pass to Moore gave Fairmont a 30-20 lead, and the Red Devils cut their deficit to two when Deondre Hallman reached the end zone on a fourth-and-goal carry from the 1 with 7:06 remaining. Strong kick coverage forced Fairmont to begin the next drive at its own 7, and it faced a third-and-15 situation when Caulder hit Moore with an over-the-top pass for a 77-yard touchdown with 4:38 left. \n“We outplayed ourselves as far as not being in the right positions and not finishing,” Red Springs coach Ron Cook said. \nAn unsuccessful two-point try from the 18-yard line following a celebration penalty allowed Red Springs to regain possession with only an eight-point deficit, and carries by Alexander moved the ball toward midfield before the Red Devils lost a fumble. \nFairmont is currently tied with South Columbus for second place in the league, but the Tornadoes won the head-to-head meeting and the Stallions haven’t faced Whiteville yet, so Friday’s outcome in Red Springs was critical to the Three Rivers race. \nFairmont prevailed despite losing its starting center, middle linebacker DeAngelo McMillian and skill player Keith McDaniel to injuries. \n“Although we lost three major players, other kids stepped up,” coach Mark Heil said. “That just shows the character of our football team.” \nStaff writer Bret Strelow can be reached at strelowb@fayobserver.com or 486-3513. \nFairmont: 6 8 8 14 — 36 \nRed Springs: 0 7 13 8 — 28 \nF — Keith McDaniel 15 pass from Julius Caulder (run failed) \nRS — Ronald Alexander 16 run (Brayan Azua kick) \nF — Halijah McLean 3 pass from Caulder (Isaac Howard pass from Caulder) \nRS — Alexander 43 run (run failed) \nRS — Alexander 4 run (Azua kick) \nF — Jarique Moore 46 pass from Caulder (Moore pass from Caulder) \nF — Caulder 2 run (Moore pass from Caulder) \nRS — Deondre Hallman 1 run (Cody Freeman run) \nF — Moore 77 pass from Caulder (pass failed) \nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS \nRushing: F — McLean 4-16, Caulder 15-14, Jarique Moore 2-4, McDaniel 1-(-3), team 4-(-8).
