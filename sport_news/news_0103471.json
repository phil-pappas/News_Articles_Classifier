(AP) - Leonard Fournette can auction the purple No. 7 jersey he wore in Saturday's game against the Gamecocks and donate the proceeds to South Carolina flood victims.\nFournette made history in the jersey by becoming the fastest to 1,000 yards in a season at LSU, which has played football since 1893.\nFournette said he'd give up the jersey for auction if it was allowed. He is a New Orleans native whose home was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina a decade ago.\nThe NCAA quickly erased questions about whether it would be a violation and said on its verified Twitter account that Fournette would be permitted to offer the jersey for charity.\nLSU treated South Carolina like the home team after severe flooding forced the game to be moved to Tiger Stadium. LSU won 45-24.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
