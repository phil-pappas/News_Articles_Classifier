The demand for eels in Asian markets had led to heavy fishing for glass eels, eels which are still in the larval stage, which are shipped overseas alive to mature.\nHundreds of millions of American eel larvae return from the sea to freshwater, estuarine and marine waters every year. American eels have been harvested for thousands of years by Native American cultures, and were an important part of the diet of early colonial settlers.\nAfter examining the best scientific and commercial information available regarding past, present and future stressors facing the species, the Service determined the eel’s single population is overall stable and not in danger of extinction or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.\nNonetheless, for the species’ long-term stability, the agency recommends continuing efforts to maintain healthy habitats, monitor harvest levels, and improve river passage for migrating eels.\nThe life of the American eel begins and ends in the Sargasso Sea in the North Atlantic Ocean. Millions of adult American eels leave waters from as far north as Greenland and south to Venezuela to reproduce in the Sargasso Sea.\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1Rxy9AF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:27:54.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
