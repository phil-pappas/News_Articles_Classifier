FRANK BELLINO, FRANK BELLINO, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » MURRIETA – Just in case there was any doubt, Murrieta Valley remains the class of the Southwestern League in boys water polo.\nThe Nighthawks reaffirmed as much Thursday afternoon, riding five goals by Ian Fleenor to a 13-5 victory over host Vista Murrieta in a battle of highly ranked teams.\n“We have a reputation and we have to keep it going,” said Fleenor, a senior attacker. “We just came to play.”\nMurrieta Valley (11-7, 2-0), winner of 15 consecutive Southwestern League titles, entered ranked No. 1 in the CIF-Southern Section Division 3 coaches poll with Vista Murrieta (9-3, 1-1) not far behind at No. 4.\nThe gap between them proved larger than the rankings indicate.\nFleenor scored the Nighthawks' first goal just 19 seconds into the game, one of his four goals in their first quarter as Murrieta Valley jumped out to a 6-2 lead.\nThe Broncos didn't get their first shot on net until the 2:48 mark of the first quarter, with the Nighthawks already ahead 4-0.\n“I was really happy with the way we started the game,” Murrieta Valley coach Bryan Lynton said. “We had a great first quarter. We controlled the tempo and were able to stop what they were trying to do on offense. It worked for us early and we just kind of built on it.”\nThe Nighthawks never let Vista Murrieta within four goals the rest of the way. They extended their lead 13-4 by the end of the third quarter and played their backups the entire final quarter.\n“What's key in a game is that first goal,” Fleenor said. “We got that and I think that determined our entire game.”\nHudson Rawlings and Joshua Benitez each scored twice for Murrieta Valley and Austin Garcia finished with nine saves.\nMatt Shirey scored three goals for the Broncos and goalkeeper Tommy Lotero made 11 saves, including multiple acrobatic stops to prevent the deficit from being even larger.\n“I don't think we came even close to playing to our potential,” Vista Murrieta coach Shane Anderson said. “They're No. 1 for a reason and we're No. 4 for a reason … and they protected that No. 1 spot very well.”\nContact the writer: kglaser@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxuku-b88533364z.120151008224135000gpkcg2f1.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxuku-b88533364z.120151008224135000gpkcg2f1.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:47:35.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
