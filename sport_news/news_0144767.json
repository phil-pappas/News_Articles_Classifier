After the Bobcats answered with a touchdown of their own, Caleb McFarlin punched a 1-yard run into the end zone, that was set up by an 80-yard run by Bray, to give Ava a 12-7 lead going into the second quarter. Thayer’s sluggish start forced head coach Billy Webber to make some early changes on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. “Early in the second quarter we had to make a couple adjustments defensively,” Webber said. “And with them playing so many guys in the box and playing a lot of man cover, we did a couple things to execute offensively a little better against that pressure defense.” The adjustments made by the Bobcats (6-1) were exactly what were needed as Ava was held to just eight points the rest of the night. In the second half, the defense locked down and was at its best as Ava could produce only 72 yards of offense, while the Bobcats sealed the game on a 36-yard touchdown run by running back Braydon Pender mid-way through the fourth quarter as they took a 35-12 lead. It was the steady play of quarterback Ayden Henry, however, that led the way for the Thayer offense. Henry finished the game 14-for-23 for 178 yards and two touchdown passes. “I think he did a good job,” Webber said of Henry. “He took care of the football, got our guys in position to make plays, and made a couple big first downs for us running the ball.” Henry praised his team for his success in tonight’s win. “I give all my credit to the [offensive] line,” said Henry. “They gave me time to throw. They gave me time to make plays. Our receivers made great catches. It was a great team effort.” Although it was not the ending he had hoped for, Ava head coach Daniel Swofford saw plenty of bright spots for his team moving forward. “We played the best half of football we played all year, offensively and defensively. Thayer’s got a good football team, and we were happy to be neck-and-neck with them at the end of the second quarter. I was happy with our play in the first half.” Coach Webber was thrilled to be leaving town with the hard-fought win. “Ava’s a really well coached team. They are just always scrappy, and this is a tough place to play. Ava’s got great football tradition, and we feel fortunate to come out on top of a very tough and physical game.” Thayer will host Willow Springs and Ava will welcome Cabool next Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:39:27.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
