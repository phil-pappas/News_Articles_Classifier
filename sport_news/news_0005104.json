(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Mark Gonzales Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Can Javier Baez show maturity he's a bona fide major leaguer right now? \nIt's a good thing the Cubs developed a deep inventory of shortstops while they were trying to supplement their starting pitching. \nNow they must hope Javier Baez can provide the consistency Addison Russell provided at shortstop for the last 2 1/2 months. \nBaez will take over at shortstop after manager Joe Maddon announced Thursday that Russell, their most dependable fielder, will be out for at least the best-of-seven the National League Championship Series starting Saturday night. \nAn MRI revealed Russell, 22, suffered a moderate strain of his left hamstring while stretching a double into a triple in Monday's 8-6 victory over the Cardinals in the third game of the NL Division Series. \nRussell, who batted .242 with 13 home runs and 54 RBIs, was receiving treatment and was unavailable for comment during the Cubs' workout at Wrigley Field. \n\"He's not going to necessarily push it right now,\" Maddon said. \"Let's go on more of a normal pace with the training staff and not test it to the point where he could re-injure it again too soon by trying to be too aggressive. \n\"This permits us to put it on more of a planned situation regarding his rehab, and then we'll work it out from there. He's such a mature kid. The conversation was so easy. He got it. He was relieved in a sense (because he won't) have to push it right now.

But the Cubs are more concerned with whether he will be able to provide the same reliable defense as Russell, who had a 42-game errorless streak at shortstop and committed only four errors in 61 games there. \n\"Addison has played enough here this year to know he belongs and he can do this,\" Maddon said. \"I want to believe Javy is arriving at that same point. He hit a three-run home run (in Game 4 of the NLDS off Jon Lackey of the Cardinals) and that should boost your confidence. \n\"The big thing is consistency on defense. We have to catch the ball. We talked about it the whole time, and pitching and catching are very important to us. I know (Baez) can do it. It's a mental thing, a confidence issue. And when you're able to get a hit like (he did) under those circumstances, it does help.\" \nBaez committed a throwing error in Game 3 of the NLDS on a grounder from slow-footed Cardinal Matt Holliday after he pinch ran for Russell. But at the plate, Baez has displayed better plate discipline as his three-run homer showed. \nStarlin Castro, a three-time All-Star who lost his starting shortstop job to Russell on Aug. 7, will remain at second base but could move to short as part of a late-inning move if needed. \nRussell's injury opens up a spot on the 25-man roster. Maddon and team officials will continue to discuss their options, which include reliever Jason Motte, who hasn't pitched since Aug. 23 because of a right shoulder strain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:29:08.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
