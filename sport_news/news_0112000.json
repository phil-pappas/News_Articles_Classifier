The supervisor overheard our question and came out of his office to let us know it was not allowed for anyone except law enforcement officers to be armed. He then walked to the other office to witness the man and identified him as armed. He attempted to reach him as he was leaving, but failed. The couple had just left after voting.\nMy wife and I work at a poll and have some concerns regarding this incident. Please be aware out there.\nNot all places are appropriate to wear a weapon!\nRICK ELLISON\nSavannah\nJulian Miller knows\nwhat police need\nto protect city\nFor the last five years of my career with the Savannah-Chatham police department, I worked side-by-side with Julian Miller. That experience leads me to endorse his candidacy as a city council member in Savannah’s 4th District.\nJulian came into the department as Public Affairs Administrator — essentially the public information director — after a career in newspapers. That’s not a background that most police officers who are compelled to protect their investigations would receive with open arms.\nBut he earned the respect of first the patrol division and then the rest of the department with his professionalism, objectivity and tenaciousness.\nMorning, noon and night, he could be found 24/7 on the scene of major incidents from serious accidents to shootings.\nOfficers soon found they could rely on him to keep the public informed, the media on track and the confidence of the investigation protected.\nWhen he wasn’t talking to media, he was talking to bystanders, calling in chaplains, informing superiors and even providing water to officers and by-standers on scene. Soon, virtually the entire department learned they could depend on him to do his job and stay out of ours.\nJulian clearly understands what the department needs to protect this community and he has the determination to remove the politics from policing and provide the resources officers must have to do their jobs. I urge each voter in District 4 to cast their ballot for him in the Nov. 3 city election.\nPHILIP REILLEY\nRetired SCMPD Captain\nPooler\nJoe Steffen has the experience, expertise to make Savannah great\nMy friend and former council member, Joe Steffen, is running for Savannah City Council Post 2. Joe served on Galax City Council and was a thoughtful and dedicated member.\nWhile his governing experience was in a small city, he had to make some of the same decisions that face Savannah. Galax, Va., like Savannah, is a full service city with a council/manager form of government.\nAs such, Joe had to make budgetary decisions on school systems, fire department, social service offices, water and waste water, public safety and various other departments. He always made decisions with the taxpayer citizen in mind.\nBeyond governance, Joe has a special ability to bring people together. In times of great distress, a community that is divided needs someone who can relate to each party’s needs and can effectively bring sound ideas to the table. That ability is one of Joe’s strongest attributes.\nAs he says, the great city of Savannah deserves a great city government.\nHe has the experience and the expertise to make that happen.\nC.M. MITCHELL\nMayor\nGalax, Va.\nYou have reason to be proud of your city\nI am writing to congratulate the people of Savannah on their wonderful hospitality.\nDuring a recent visit with my wife, they were universally polite, greeting strangers on the street, including Yankees like me. And this was people of all sizes, shapes, backgrounds and colors.\nI trust you are proud of the city you serve. You certainly have reason to be so.\nFRANK HOTCHKISS\nCity Councilman\nSanta Barbara, Calif.\nPrint the facts on Clinton, let us decide\nFriday’s (Oct. 23) headline, “Clinton seeks to close book on Benghazi” is the most dishonest and biased account of any congressional story your newspaper has ever run. The Associated Press article rewrote the actual 11-hour embarrassment for one reason. They are indebted to the Clintons and to the Democratic Party, and not to the facts.\nIt was written by a team of liberals, who on one day, scream about unnecessary deaths in a war they voted for in 2001, then blame the “dumb” George Bush for fibbing to them.\nNow, when four Americans are killed in an undefended compound in a country they liberated, and after more than 100 separate times for being ignored for support, and again during the attack, Clinton pleads for our “understanding.”\nOK, they say, so what if an ally/business friend (Sidney Blumenthal) can reach her every day, during their cries for support? Others, more qualified in the Clinton State Department on security, did not think them credible and did not bother Mrs. Clinton with the requests.\nWhy? They were not fired for dereliction of duty, says Clinton, because none could be found? You put people there, then they ask repeatedly for help and they are ignored, but no one is at fault?\nIf you support Mrs. Clinton, please watch and listen to the meaningful questioning of the Oct. 22 Benghazi hearing and ask yourself: Is she someone you would trust to protect the lives of your loved ones in harm’s way?\nBut first, listen to any — I mean any — of those involved on the ground in Benghazi or the relatives of those murdered there because of a video, she admittedly disavowed, then blamed for the attack.\nWhy?\nWe know why and we don’t need a biased press to dictate what they want us to believe.\nPlease print the facts and let us decide.\nThank you.\nCHARLES OLENICK\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:00:47.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
