Cedar Grove will travel to Millburn Friday, Oct. 9 for a 7 p.m. start time against the Millers. Verona will host West Side Saturday, Oct. 10 at 1 p.m. \nVerona dominated West Side 48-6 when the two teams faced off last season, but head coach Lou Racioppe said he has tried to get his squad to focus on the present, not the past. \n\"Last year is last year,\" Racioppe said. \"There is no reference amongst any players or coaches as to what was accomplished last year. The 2015 team is 4-0 and we are only looking forward to our game this week against West Side.\" \nRacioppe has cautioned his team, coming off a bye week, to not take the 0-4 West Side squad lightly. \"West Side is down this year and while you never know what will happen, I think this is a game we can easily control.\" \nThe 3-1 Panthers have a tougher matchup in Millburn. Cedar Grove defeated the Millers 28-0 in 2014, but head coach Ed Sadloch said this year's Millburn squad is better, evidenced by their 3-0 record. \n\"I think Coach [Patrick] Leonardis has done a great job at Millburn and he and his whole staff have prepared their kids well,\" Sadloch said. \"It's going to be a good test for both teams.\" \nThe Cedar Grove defense will have its hands full with Millburn's strong rushing attack, which Sadloch said has been the Millers' biggest key to their success. \nThere has been a lot of focus on shutting down Milburn senior running back Zack Weinstein, who has posted strong numbers through the Millers' first three games. Weinstein has carried the ball 80 times for 585 yards and three touchdowns. \nThe senior has three 100-yard games so far this season. The veteran coach said tackling has been a big focus during practice this week. \n\"They're running the ball very well,\" Sadloch said of Millburn. \"They have a few good runners. We're going to have our hands full going to contain them.\" \nThe Panthers defense has performed well since their opening-day loss to Cedar Creek in early September. Sadloch said some personnel shifts have played a factor in the unit's success. \n\"I think senior Mike Dougan has done a great job since we put him at linebacker,\" he said. \"I think moving Ferrara to defensive end from linebacker has helped us tremendously as well.\" \nWhile the Panthers have worked hard on defense during practice this week, the Hillbillies have set a goal to maintain their defense's high level of play. Verona has surrendered just 14 points all season and the starters have yet to allow a point. \n\"On defense we will look to be aggressive to the ball, tackle well and create turnovers,\" Racioppe said. \nOffensively, Verona has used a strong running game from senior Mark Riggio and junior quarterback Zack Zaccone to lead its offense. However, Racioppe said there might be more opportunities to throw the ball against West Side. \n\"We are going to mix it up offensively, trying to balance between the run and pass and hopefully work on some things we have not had a chance to use in our earlier games,\" he said. \nCedar Grove has also relied on a strong running game to pace its offense. The Panthers have a plethora of rushers who can carry the ball, something Sadloch said has been beneficial so far. \n\"I've always enjoyed not isolating a single running back. When you have a great one, you have to use him. But this year, our offense allows us to share the wealth,\" Sadloch said. \"Going into this season, we knew we had six or seven good backs who could carry the ball and I think pretty much everyone has had a chance to carry the ball so far. Each one can bring something different to the table. \" \nBoth games this weekend represent the first divisional matchup for each team. Sadloch said winning divisional games play a huge factor moving forward. The results of these games can impact the standings more so than a non-division contest. \n\"It's important for the division and for the playoffs,\" Sadloch said. \"We have to keep winning so we can advance and get to our goal, which is getting to the playoffs.\" \nRacioppe also understands the importance of these matchups and said the start of the divisional portion of their schedule could not come at a better time with Verona coming off its bye week.
