The vehicle's owner chased the three away with a warning shot from a shotgun fired at the ground from the balcony of his apartment, Lubbock police spokesman Lt. Ray Mendoza said.\nThey were arrested shortly after, according to police, and booked into the Lubbock County Jail.\nThe story was first reported by the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal.\nThe two-star recruit is a senior at Lubbock Coronado, where he plays primarily on the offensive line. The class-of-2016 recruit is orally committed to Texas Tech. Oral commitments are non-binding.\nCoronado head football coach Seth Parr told the Avalanche-Journal that Giddens was not present at the Mustangs' most recent game, though he is still on the team.\nGiddens, along with Stefan Jordan Cordova, 17, and an unnamed person under 17, were arrested shortly after the alleged burglary, according to police records.\nBoth Giddens and Cordova were charged with organized crime, an enhancement to the burglary charge, Mendoza said. The state penal code defines as \"three or more persons who collaborate in carrying on criminal activities.\" The Avalanche-Journal reports the charge is closed, though the Class A Misdemeanor charge of vehicular burglary is still open.\nClick here to read the full report.\nOn Twitter:\n @TommyMagelssen", "external_links": ["http://lonestarvarsity.com/news/12020/texas-tech-football-commit,-coronado-standout-among-3-arrested-in-vehicle-burglary-case/", "https://twitter.com/TommyMagelssen"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:56:31.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
