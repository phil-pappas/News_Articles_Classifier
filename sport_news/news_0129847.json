Among quarterbacks, only Jerrard Randall of Arizona has rushed for more yards, averaging 89.0 per game.\nCollins has topped the 100-yard mark three times, and CU defensive coordinator Jim Leavitt said the Buffs have to be wary of the 6-foot-3, 195-pounder.\n\"This guy presents a real challenge,\" Leavitt said. \"There has not really been anybody that's stopped him that I've seen. They've usually stopped themselves.\"\nTo this point, Randall is the only running quarterback the Buffs have seen, and they couldn't stop him. Randall came off the bench to rally Arizona to a 38-31 win against the Buffs on Saturday. Randall ran for 81 yards and led Arizona to three touchdowns, despite playing only the fourth quarter and three plays of the third quarter.\nThe Buffs are hoping that seeing Randall last week will help them going into this week's matchup with Collins.\nAdvertisement \"We know where we got exploited, so we know where they might attack us and that could help, but it just comes down to being assignment sound,\" defensive end Derek McCartney said. \"We just have to make sure we get lined up right and stay assignment sound and we'll be just fine.\"\nLeavitt said CU's youth played a role in Randall having success. Injuries forced the Buffs to rotate three freshmen, including two true freshmen, at inside linebacker against the Wildcats.\n\"We were in position to make plays, we just didn't make plays, for whatever reason,\" Leavitt said. \"We just didn't. A couple times the big busts were young guys that hadn't played.\"\nThose are mistakes that can be corrected, Leavitt said, but it also helps that CU will get junior Kenneth Olugbode back this week.\nRegardless of who plays, though, McCartney said the Buffs simply need to do what they're supposed to do, and do it for four quarters.\n\"It starts with leaders and it starts in practice,\" he said. \"You have to be able to go a whole practice, intense and focused and being assignment sound. When you do that in practice and you're intense and your leaders are pushing you to do that, it's going to happen in the game.\"\nGetting better\nThroughout the season, CU quarterback Sefo Liufau has taken some heat for not playing as well as he has in the past.\nWhile Liufau's touchdown numbers are down — he's on pace to throw 15 TD passes after tossing 28 last year — he's improved in several other areas.\nIn particular, Liufau is averaging 7.3 yards per attempt and 12.0 yards per completion, up from 6.4 and 9.8 in 2014. He's actually on pace to break his school record for single-season passing yards (3,200 in 2014), despite being on pace for fewer attempts.\nLiufau has also led the Buffs to more points this year. CU has averaged 2.19 points per possession with Liufau at the helm, compared to 2.11 last year. CU is averaging 31.6 points per game, compared to 28.5 last season.\nNotable\nCU began raising its practice bubble this week, but it's a process that takes several days, and it was not ready for Wednesday's rainy practice. So, the Buffs made their way to Boulder High School to practice on the artificial surface at Recht Field. ... CU comes into this game having given up 36 or more points in 12 consecutive Pac-12 games. Oregon State, on the other hand, has been held below 36 points in 10 straight Pac-12 games. Last time the Beavers hit the 36-point mark in a Pac-12 game was a 36-31 win against the Buffs on Oct. 4, 2014. ... The Buffs are a perfect 9-for-9 in the red zone during Pac-12 play (seven touchdowns, two field goals). They were 14 of 21 in non-conference play.\nBrian Howell: howellb@dailycamera.com , on Twitter: @BrianHowell33.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:41:41.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
