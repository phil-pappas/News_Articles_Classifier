One of the plays that set up the score was a 34-yard completion from Mangum to Mitchell Juergens.\nThe Cougars opened up a two-score lead when Mangum found Mitch Mathews for a 20-yard touchdown. Francis Bernard carried the load on the three-play drive with runs of 7 and 21 yards.\nAfter another Wagner punt, the Cougars were back in the end zone when Algernon Brown broke free for a 42-yard touchdown run. Another nice play on the possession came when Mangum found Nick Kurtz for a 14-yard gain.\nBrown found the pay dirt from 37 yards out as the Cougars took a 28-0 first-quarter lead. A key play on the drive came when Bernard picked up 7 yards on third-and-3 to keep the drive alive.\nMathews scored his second touchdown of the half when he and Mangum hooked up for a 19-yard touchdown. The score was set up by a leaping 46-yard catch from Terenn Houk on third-and-8 that gave the Cougars the ball deep in the Seahawks' territory.\nBernard got into the act when he scored from 1-yard out to push the lead to 42-0. The touchdown was set up by first-down receptions from Devon Blackmon and Juergens as well as a first-down run from Bernard.\nBeau Hoge scored his first touchdown as a Cougar from 2 yards out to give the Cougars a 49-point advantage. BYU moved the ball all 40 yards of the drive on the ground, including a 16-yard run from Hoge.\nWagner got on the board on the first possession of the second half when Matthias McKinnon scored from 1-yard out on third-and-goal. Alex Thomson came up big for the Seahawks with three third-down conversions through the air and one on the ground.\nThe Cougars answered when Hoge found David Kessler for a 47-yard touchdown. Josh Weeks made a big play to keep the chains when he gained 13 yards on a pass from Hoge on third-and-7.\nNate Carter gave BYU its ninth touchdown of the day when he found a huge hole and exploded for a 70-yard rushing score.\nHoge scored the last touchdown of the day on a 1-yard run that capped off the longest BYU possession of the day. Akile Davis came up with a key play when he extended the drive, thanks to a 9-yard reception on third-and-2.\nThree stars\n3. Beau Hoge\nHoge had his best showing as a Cougar. He completed 8 of 11 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown to go along with 12 rushes for 47 yards and two more scores.\n2. Algernon Brown\nBrown had two big first-quarter touchdown runs to open up the early lead. He totaled just six carries for 109 yards and the two scores.\n1. Tanner Mangum\nMangum had a stellar first-half before he was replaced by Hoge. He completed 12 of 13 passes for 237 yards, including touchdowns of 16, 20 and 19 yards.\nAnalyzing the stats\nWhile the Seahawks won the time of possession battle, BYU outgained Wagner 741-129. The Cougars also had a 31-6 advantage in first downs.\nOf BYU's 10 touchdown drive, six took less than two minutes. The lone Wagner scoring possession was 8:08.\nThe BYU signal callers finished the game having completed 23 of 27 passes for 411 yards and four touchdowns, including a perfect 3 of 3 by Koy Detmer Jr. for 57 yards. Wagner threw for 46 yards on the day.\nEven though 31 passes were completed in the game, neither team had a player catch more than three passes (Mathews, David Kessler and Josh Weeks had three receptions each).\nOf the 129 yards the Cougar defense gave up, 70 came on the opening drive of the second half. Wagner gained more than 10 yards on a possession only one other time in the game.\nUp next\nThe Cougars have the week off to prepare for a matchup with the San Jose State Spartans. The Spartans are 4-4 on the season, including 3-2 in the Mountain West. They have wins over New Hampshire, Fresno State, UNLV and New Mexico. Their four losses have come at the hands of Air Force, Oregon State, Auburn and San Diego State.\nThe one player that the Cougars must account for if they expect to come away with the road win is running back Tyler Ervin. He has been dominant on the ground much of the season with 193 carries for 1,159 yards and 12 touchdowns. He has also done some nice things in the passing game with 30 catches for 232 yards and two scores.\nJay Yeomans is a courier by day and a freelance writer by night.
