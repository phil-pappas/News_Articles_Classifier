The win puts Logano into the Eliminator round and takes the pressure off going to Kansas this week and then the wildcard race of the Chase at the 2.67-mile restrictor plate layout at Talladega. \n“This makes Talladega way easier,” Logano said beaming in victory lane after his 12th career victory and fourth of this year. “Helps us sleep here the next couple of nights. \n“What a great car. Pit crew was on top of it. Getting this win at Charlotte means a lot. I think its on everyone’s bucket list. To be able to have that pressure off (the rest of the round) … That’s going to pay big dividends.” \nLogano posted his first career win at the track considered home as most NASCAR teams are within an hour or so of the speedway just northeast of the Queen City. \nA strategy call by Gordon put Logano in the lead on lap 77 by staying out under caution and he only gave it up under green-flag stops. The crew did their job, not only getting him off pit road under green to retain the lead, but getting him out first under the one caution stop, where he held serve and held the lead through his six restarts with defending series champ Kevin Harvick giving chase. \nThe first race of the Contender Round opened two straight weeks at 1.5-mile tracks before the series heads to Talladega for the third and deciding race of the round to see which four of the 12 championship contenders are eliminated. What was supposed to be the only night race of the Chase turned into Charlotte’s first day race since a Coca-Cola 600 rain-delay in 2009 — and it produced quite a turn of events for some of the top teams. \nDale Earnhardt Jr. was the first of the championship drivers to get into trouble, but not the last - nor the worst. Contact with Carl Edwards put him into the wall, the first of at least three hits which ended up leaving his battered Chevrolet to finish 28th, four laps off the pace \nBut that was just the start. \nWhile Logano stayed out to take the lead pretty much for good after the caution for Earnhardt’s incident. Later, Matt Kenseth slid across the nose of Ryan Newman’s Chevrolet and slammed the wall coming off turn four. He would later hit the wall again, harder, ending his day in the garage in 42nd. Then during the seventh caution, Kyle Larson was told to come to pit road late and collided with Kyle Busch, who decided to not pit, essentially ending his chances while running in the top five, finishing 20th. \n“I don’t know. Just can’t say enough about my guys – all the work that they put into these things,” Busch said. “They don’t deserve to be put in these situations year in, year out, but we are for some reason.” \nLarson took complete responsibility, saying he was told to do what the leader did and then got word at the last minute to pit, only Busch was already there and coming back up onto the track. \n” I feel really terrible to ruin their day and hopefully it didn’t hurt their chances of transferring through this round.,” he said. “I know they deserve a top three finish for sure. I felt awful immediately and still do. I hate it.” \nNot long after that, perennial CMS favorite Jimmie Johnson lost the motor in his Chevrolet while running in the top three, finishing 39th. \nMeanwhile through all that, Logano kept his Ford out front and comfortably ahead of the rest of the field, including Harvick, who tried more than once to run down Logano. \n“We could hang with him (Joey Logano), but I would just lose him every once in a while in traffic. It was just extremely hard to pass.” \nMartin Truex Jr. rallied from an early scrape with the wall to finish third with Denny Hamlin and Kurt Busch rounding out the top five in a race with many small storylines within the race after rain postponed it from Saturday night. Carl Edwards was sixth followed by Austin Dillon, a non-Chase driver. Jeff Gordon was eighth in his final Cup Series start at CMS followed by Brad Keselowski and Aric Almirola in tenth, his fourth top-10 in the last five weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:17:46.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
