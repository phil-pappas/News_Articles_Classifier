Sturgis has missed two extra points in his two weeks as Eagles kicker. His field goals were from 29, 26, 39, and 41 yards. \nCoach Chip Kelly twice elected to go for fourth downs instead of kicking long field goals. In the first quarter, the offense stayed on the field for a fourth and 7 from the Saints' 39-yard line. The Eagles could not convert. In the second quarter, Kelly tried a fourth and 9 from the Saints' 35-yard line. That attempt also failed. \nSturgis hit two 54-yard field goals in pregame warm-ups, so Kelly considered that his range. The first fourth-down attempt was out of Sturgis' range and the second one was \"on the edge,\" Kelly said. \n\"I just felt like our offense had confidence, that we could move the football on them,\" Kelly said. \"I felt like I leave our offense on the field because I do have confidence in our defense. I think our defense has played well.\" Avoiding Sproles \nDarren Sproles did not have a punt return against his former team, who tried to kick away from him. He caught one punt for a fair catch, two were downed, one went out of bounds, and one was a touchback. The good part for the Eagles was that the Saints had a 36.2-yard net punting average as a result. \n\"It shows up on the stat sheet because the starting field position is where it shows up,\" Kelly said. \"So that's part of Darren's ability . . . when we had Darren in in the pass game, they were doubling him.\" Extra points \nLinebacker Marcus Smith was active for only the second time this season. Smith was the team's third outside linebacker. He finished with one tackle and one quarterback hit. \n\"We had planned on getting him in there,\" Kelly said. \"It was good to get him back out on the field, but I couldn't tell you exactly [how Smith did].\" \nThe Eagles' inactive players were quarterback Thad Lewis, running back Kenjon Barner, cornerback Denzel Rice, linebacker Kiko Alonso, offensive lineman Julian Vandervelde, linebacker Mychal Kendricks, and defensive end Brandon Bair. Alonso (knee), Kendricks (hamstring), and Bair (groin) were declared out for the game. \nDefensive lineman Cedric Thornton and Taylor Hart returned to the lineup after missing the last two games. Safety Chris Maragos returned after missing the last game and played his role in the nickel formation. He also had two special-teams tackles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:24:33.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
