Obviously, as you heard time and again when the trades were made in July and August, it will take years to properly grade these deals, but let's take a look at the prospects the Phillies loaded their minor league system with since July — how they performed since they arrived and where they might start the 2016 season. \nThe Phillies also received left Matt Harrison from the Rangers, but we'll leave him out since he hasn't pitched yet, may never pitch for them if his back doesn't cooperate and at 30, with eight years in the majors, isn't a prospect. \nC Jorge Alfaro \nSurgery on his left ankle kept him from playing very much after he came to Philadelphia in the deal that shipped Cole Hamels and Jake Diekman to Texas so the Phillies haven't seen much of him in their system. He played just three games for the Gulf Coast League Phillies. He could be in big league camp in spring training but even if everything goes well, the earliest he probably would see major league action would be as a September call-up. \nRHP Jake Thompson \nAs exciting as Alfaro could be, Thompson's right up there. It's possible his ceiling is higher than any pitcher the Phillies currently have in the entire system. Thompson, who also was in the Hamels deal , impressed in his short time at Double-A Reading going 5-1 in seven starts with a 1.80 ERA. Phillies manager Pete Mackanin left open the possibility of players jumping from Double-A to the majors and Thompson is certainly a candidate. If he impresses in spring, he could join Aaron Nola in the 2016 starting rotation along with… \nRHP Jerad Eickhoff \nEverybody was able to see some of what the 25-year-old, one of five prospects Texas sent to Philly, has to offer the last few weeks of the season. He posted a 2.65 ERA after making his major league debut Aug. 21 but improved each time out. . His last four games he went seven innings in each start and posted a 0.96 ERA while opposing hitters batted just .170 off him. Mackanin called him a \"true competitor\" after his final start of the year, in which the manager pushed him to the limit. Mackanin called it a test and Eickhoff, \"passed it with flying colors.\" He's probably the closest thing to a lock for next season's starting rotation after Nola. \nRHP Alec Asher \nAnother pitcher coming over in the Texas deal, who turned 24 at the beginning of the month, also was able to show some of what he has to offer. The only problem is he wasn't nearly as impressive as Eickhoff. Going 0-6 with a 9.31 ERA in his first seven major league games doesn't mean he's a bust. It just means he needs a little more work in the minors. \"He needs some polish,\" Mackanin said after Asher's penultimate start of 2015. \"He's going to be a good pitcher. He's not quite there yet and it's our job to polish him up.\" He should start 2016 with the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. \nOF Nick Williams \nThe fifth prospect Texas sent to Philadelphia this year could be another player to make a big leap to the majors if the 22-year-old proves he's major league ready in the spring, Mackanin said. Williams hit .320 in 22 regular-season games with Reading and showed some power. The Phillies are definitely looking at him as a big piece in their future outfield but more likely he starts at Triple-A and possibly gets his first taste of big league ball later in the year depending on his performance and how things go in Philadelphia. \nRHP Nick Pivetta \nThe 22-year-old struggled a bit in his seven starts in the Phillies organization after being the return in the trade that sent Papelbon to the Nationals . He was 2-2 with a 7.31 ERA in Reading and his walks plus hits per innings pitched was a bit high. He is trying to right the ship this offseason in the Arizona Fall League. Unless things drastically change, he won't be on Philadelphia's radar until 2017 at the earliest. \nIF/OF Darnell Sweeney \nOne of two players the Phillies received from the Dodgers for Chase Utley, the 24-year-old spent his entire time with the organization in Philadelphia. Thanks to Cesar Hernandez's dislocated left thumb, and being a part of the outfield rotation, Sweeney played in 37 games (21 starts) between Aug. 20 and the season finale . Defensively, he was fine playing all three outfield positions as well as second and third, but he hit just .176. He doesn't look like a solid piece going forward but if he swings the bat like he did last year in the Arizona Fall League — he batted .316, scored 14 runs and knocked in 12 in 19 games — he could be a versatile bench piece. \nRHP John Richy \nThe other player acquired for Utley, Richy threw just two games for the organization, both for Single-A Clearwater. In the 12 2/3 innings he pitched, he allowed just one homer, posting a 2.84 ERA. Obviously, the 23-year-old is a bit further away from the majors than the players above, but MLB.com projects him as a \"durable end-of-the-rotation starter.\" \nRHP Jimmy Cordero \nCordero, 23, was one of two players the Phillies received from Toronto for Ben Revere. He's a hard-throwing reliever who got a small opportunity to close for Reading in the Eastern League playoffs. He did much better in the regular season for the Fightins posting a 2.12 ERA in 13 games. In the playoffs, he was touched up in two of the four games he pitched. If he begins to develop this year, which will probably be in Double-A, it could allow the Phillies, if they choose, to deal Ken Giles, one of their only big trade chips left. Aside from someone such as Mariano Rivera, closers typically have the prime of their career end much earlier than other players. Giles will be at least 27 by the time the Phillies are thinking playoffs again. \nRHP Alberto Tirado \nAnother reliever acquired for Revere, the 20-year-old also has a power arm. He was almost untouchable in Single-A , going 1-0 with a 0.56 ERA in nine appearances for Clearwater. Control will be the key for Tirado but he has time to work on that. At the earliest, he could see time in the majors at some point in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:16:44.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
