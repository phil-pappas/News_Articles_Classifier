He said the one and only aim of the coalition regime was to provide corruption free and accountable governance to the people at their doorsteps. Addressing a meeting of party leaders and workers from Udhampur district, Jugal said ‘Agenda of Alliance’ was the base of the PDP-BJP dispensation and both the parties were committed to follow it. He said the people of Jammu province had exhibited their faith in the BJP as they were fed up with the National Conference, Congress and Panthers Party. “After registering splendid victory in the Assembly elections, the BJP formed coalition with the PDP on the agenda of development, good governance and ending corruption,” said Jugal, adding that the government was working round the clock towards mitigation people’s sufferings. “Both the Central and state governments are committed to development,” he said and assured that promises made to the people would be fulfilled. Jugal said the parties which ruled the state for maximum period after the Independence did nothing for the people and now on being shown the way, their leaders were feeling frustrated and made baseless and misleading statements. The meeting, convened by district president and Chenani MLA Dina Nath Bhagat, was attended by local leaders, district office bearers and prominent party activists from different parts of Udhampur district.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:19:50.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
