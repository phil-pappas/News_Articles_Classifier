They played without head coach Joe Jones and leading rusher DeShaun Wethington, who missed the game after they were ejected the previous week. But they return for this huge Suffolk battle with major playoff implications. Kickoff is 7 Friday night. The teams \nNansemond River (3-4): The Warriors snapped a two-game losing streak last week with a win over Great Bridge. They are led by running back Terrence Lambert, who is sixth in South Hampton Roads in rushing with 792 yards. He also has nine touchdowns. Defensively, the Warriors are led by linebacker Demetrius Stitmon.\nKing's Fork (5-2): The Bulldogs have to put last week's loss behind them. After Nansemond River, King's Fork closes the regular season against Oscar Smith and Deep Creek. The good news: running back Deshaun Wethington returns to the lineup after missing last week's game. He is the fourth-leading rusher in South Hampton Roads with 983 yards, even though he's missed two games.\nWhat you need to know \nKing's Fork enters seeded No. 3 in the Eastern division of the Group 4A East Region. Nansemond River is tied for sixth in the Eastern Division of the Group 5A South Region.\n\"It's a big game for both of us because we're both jockeying for position as far as the playoffs,\" King's Fork coach Joe Jones said. \"So there will be no lack of motivation for either team.\"\nJones added that the Bulldogs are eager to play following last week's loss.\n\"We were disappointed in last week because we know we could have played better,\" he said.\nThe game also is big because a King's Fork win will give the Bulldogs the mythical Suffolk City title after beating Lakeland this season.\n\"We want to win a state title but we also want to be the best team in the city, too,\" Jones said.\nJones knows Nansemond River will be ready, too.\n\"Coach (David) Coccoli has done a great job over there,\" he said. \"All of the kids know each other. So from a motivational standpoint, we don't have to do a lot.\"\nWho will win \nLarry Rubama says: Bulldogs get things rolling with Wethington back. King's Fork, 24-21.\nJami Frankenberry says: Bulldogs win third straight city crown.
