Jha was hospitalised.\n“It could be a part of political rivalry during the election. We are investigating into the case from all angles,” a police official said.\nIn the second incident, a time bomb was planted near the office of Rashmi Verma, who was denied ticket by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and was contesting as an Independent from Narkatiaganj assembly seat. A threat letter asked her not to contest the poll.\n“We have defused the time bomb and began an investigation,” a police official said.\nLast week, too, she got a threat letter asking her not to contest the upcoming Bihar Assembly poll as a rebel candidate, prompting her to lodge a complaint with Sikarpur police station.\nThe letter, according to her, also threatened that if she goes ahead and contests the poll, it will not be good for her children. — IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:02:52.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
