And as the action kicks off later this week, the buzz has been mounting steadily on social media.\nThe season didn’t end the way the team may have wanted, with a 12-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Sunday.\nBut it was the Jays’ decision to start Mark Buerhle — who was just two innings shy of registering 200 innings pitched for the 15th-straight season — that had people talking.\nWas it a classy move? Or were you left wondering what the Jays coaching staff was thinking?\nMeanwhile, fans have continued to heap love on the team.\nDid you catch Kevin Pillar’s Superman-like, diving catch on Saturday?\nWhat about the question everyone — including his own teammates — is asking: Is Marcus Stroman wearing a long shirt, or a skirt?\nEven Halloween pumpkins are cheering on the Blue Jays.\nFavourite city councillor Norm Kelly assured the city that “ the Taylor Swift ‘curse’ will have no effect ” on the Jays. Swift herself even cheered for the team during her concert at the Rogers Centre over the weekend.\nBut not everyone was so sure. “Jays are 0-2 since Taylor Swift performed at the Rogers Centre. The curse is real,” someone wrote on Twitter . “Maybe that Taylor Swift curse thing is legit…” Sportsnet’s Jackie Redmond commented .\nBut the Blue Jays players aren’t letting a few losses to end the regular season get them down.

City better be turned all the way up. It’s a new season, and we still breathin’!”\nhttps://twitter.com/rachelroyalkc/status/650757352530931712\nMore on thestar.com\nView from Texas: Rangers savour AL West clinch, Blue Jays up next\nEugenie Bouchard retires from opening match at China Open with dizziness", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/rachelroyalkc/status/650757352530931712", "http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "https://twitter.com/norm/status/649917323072159744", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/yCsS_7xWDbs?wmode=transparent", "https://twitter.com/Jackie_Redmond/status/650759143482085377", "https://instagram.com/p/8bI4uummBj/", "https://twitter.com/MStrooo6/status/650810653507239936", "https://twitter.com/bluejayhotstove/status/650833391458365440"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:12:18.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
