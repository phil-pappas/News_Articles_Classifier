That’s when one of the men pulled out a gun and demanded money.\nThe two robbers took off with just 15 bucks from the driver, but took a sense of security from the community.\n“Now it’s gotten to the point where people are scared because you go out there and pick up the wrong person that’s either going to kill you or rob you,” said dispatcher Patricia Leclaire. “I mean, it’s getting ridiculous ... It’s gotten to the point that I don’t’ even want to send cabs to New Orleans.”\nLeclaire, worked as a cab driver for 22 years until she became an armed robbery victim.\n“I got robbed May 30 , 9 year ago, and ever since then I’ve been in this office,” Leclaire said. “When you get a gun stuck to your head and you don’t know if you’re going to live ... it affects you.” Leclaire said.\nThe recent armed robbery has cab drivers on edge. Many of them refuse to pick up in New Orleans.\n“If it’s a regular customer that needs to come back to the Westbank, I’ll go, but I tell my dispatcher 'make sure they’re ready to jump in, because I’m not hanging around,'” Rendia Gourgues said.“They seem to think that we are easy target, and we don’t carry a lot of cash because we know better.\"\nGlen's Cab Company has been through a lot. They’ve lost two of their cab drivers to murder after picking up fares, one of them last year.\n“He got killed right around the corner,” said cab driver Brian Guenin. “It’s dangerous out here. I don’t even work at night anymore.\"\nPolice arrested the first of two suspects on Friday, Oct. 9. James Causey, 18, was taken in by police around 4:20 p.m. after police recognized him on the street and he admitted his involvement in the robbery.The second suspects is still at large.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
