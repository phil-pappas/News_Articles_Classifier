Comment By Pat Graham/The Associated Press Wicked Local By Pat Graham/The Associated Press Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 12:53 AM Updated at 12:56 AM By Pat Graham/The Associated Press Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 12:53 AM Updated at 12:56 AM DENVER —Jimmy Hayes had a goal and three assists, Jonas Gustavsson stopped 20 shots and the Boston Bruins beat the Colorado Avalanche 6-2 on Wednesday night to avoid their worst start in 50 years. The Bruins raced out to a 5-0 lead by the second period and cruised from there to end a three-game slide. Kevan Miller and Hayes scored 2:22 apart in the first period, with Tyler Randell, Chris Kelly and Ryan Spooner scoring in the second. Spooner's goal with 4:28 remaining in the second ended a rough evening for Semyon Varlamov, who stopped 14 of 19 shots before being relieved by Reto Berra. David Krejci added an empty-net goal with 1:29 left. Gustavsson was starting for Tuukka Rask and stymied a high-powered Avalanche team that had 10 goals in two games. Gabriel Landeskog had a power-play goal and John Mitchell added another for Colorado. With the win, the Bruins averted some dubious history. They hadn't started 0-4 in a season since 1964-65. Boston was without forward Brad Marchand (concussion) and defenseman Joe Morrow, who has the flu. The team spread out the scoring with 10 different players picking up a point, including two assists by captain Zdeno Chara. Rask has gotten off to a rocky start this season. He has a 4.72 goals-against average and an .846 save percentage. Those aren't very Rask-like numbers, considering he's currently third in career GAA (2.18) and tied for second in save percentage (.925) among active goaltenders with at least 50 appearances. Gustavsson attended training camp with the Bruins on a professional tryout and was signed earlier this month. The 30-year-old was limited by injuries last season with Detroit, going 3-3-1 with one shutout. His best save of the night was when he turned back Avalanche rookie Mikko Rantanen on a breakaway late in the first period. In the third period, Gustavsson turned back Landeskog twice on a play — once by using his left leg and again with his chest. Miller got Boston off to a fast start when he sent a slap shot over the right shoulder of a screened Varlamov. Moments later, Hayes grabbed a rebound and pushed it in for his first goal of the season. Carl Soderberg finished with no points against his former team. He spent the last three seasons with Boston before being dealt to Colorado over the summer and then signed to a five-year deal. NOTES: Bruins D Tommy Cross played in his first NHL game. He was called up from Providence of the American Hockey League on Tuesday. ... Avalanche F Jarome Iginla played in his 1,395th NHL game, tying him with Roman Hamrlik for 35th place on the league's all-time list. ... Colorado switched up its defense, scratching Nate Guenin and activating Brad Stuart.
