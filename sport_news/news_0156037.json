That is expecting a rather convenient acquiescence from the country to a grave undercurrent of communal polarisation set off by none other than those at the very helm of the government. Whether out of ideological conviction or political calculations, the BJP has kept up a sustained crusade to make the majority acutely conscious of its religious identity. The dragging out of a 50-year-old man to be lynched and his son being mauled on an impromptu allegation made on a loudspeaker is the ugly denouement of this politics. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that such incidents are calculated to influence the coming panchayat polls in UP. Cow slaughter has been one instrument through which the Hindu right has repeatedly sought to transcend the caste divide that has kept the majority from functioning as a united entity. The attempts have so far been unsuccessful, but the BJP’s coming to power has given the effort a fresh impetus. Emphasis on anti-meat or cow slaughter bans and laws have emboldened the fringe outfits to take their vigilante role into villages, streets and people’s homes. Secularism, which had been an essential part of all government discourse in the social domain, has been condemned as ‘sickular’. That would be justified as far as it referred to its cynical use in appeasing any community. But the NDA government is duty bound to pronounce its alternative definition of ‘real secularism’. How will it explain the repeated reference to animal slaughter by Prime Minister Modi in his political speeches? He has to now make an unequivocal declaration that no one can or will be allowed to attack anyone, whether or not a cow was slaughtered. The Prime Minister is in imminent danger of losing it out to the fanatic fringe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:12:18.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
