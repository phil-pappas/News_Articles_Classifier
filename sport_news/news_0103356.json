The Chiefs are in the exact same place they were last season, needing a win against the Wolves to spark a final push into a potential state playoff berth. Special photo by William Lofton slideshow After giving up a 28-point second-half lead last week, Sequoyah will face another tough subregion test in a visit from Rome tonight.Dashed on a last-second field goal by Creekview, Sequoyah (2-5, 2-2) now finds itself in a three-way tie for third in the subregion with Cass, which the Chiefs have already beaten, and Rome (4-3, 2-2). “Our kids have handled last week really well,” Sequoyah coach James Teter said. “We’ve had a good week of practice. The kids have been upbeat and they’re dealing with everything a lot better than I expected. They know how big this next game is, and we’re just looking forward, not behind us.”One thing that makes the loss somewhat easier to take is the fact that the Chiefs are not in uncharted territory. The season has gone just the same way it did in 2014, when Sequoyah used a win over Rome to spark a run of four straight wins, including one in the state playoffs.“It was a tough loss last week, but we’re still in the same spot we were last year,” Teter said. “The stakes seem just as high as they were last year, so every game is huge right now. Obviously, it’s a different group of kids this year, but they can look to the guys that were here last year and see that we’re still in it.”The best sign for Sequoyah is the emergence of its offense. After scoring 58 points in their first five games — with 41 coming in a single game against River Ridge — the Chiefs have exploded for 59 points in the last two games.Led by quarterback Austin Tracy, receiver Derrion Rakestraw and running back Trey Mitchell, Sequoyah jumped out to a 35-7 third-quarter lead last week, but the offense got conservative and turned the ball over late. Those are things the Chiefs will have to fix if they don’t want to lose any more leads.“We’ve talked about a lot of stuff with our kids, and it had to do with the plays we were calling,” Teter said. “The biggest issue is that it’s a little more difficult in a spread offense to slow the tempo down. That’s what we’ve spent the most time on. When you have a lead, how do you eat some clock? We’re so used to ‘go, go, go’ in a big hurry that we have to get in a different mindset, step back and slow down a little bit and eat some clock.”To get a lead, Sequoyah will have to slow down Rome’s physical running game. Linebackers Mac Wells, Greyson Van Dyke and Ethan Bruce, along with a defensive line led by Nick Cheney, will need to play well.Despite the loss last week, Teter is pleased with the way his team has been playing lately. The offense is clicking, and the defense, which has been solid for most of the season, only gave up 38 points last week because of some poor field position. Now, the Chiefs just have to put those things together and come up with some wins to end the season.“Hopefully, we continue to grow,” Teter said. “I like what our offense has done the last two or three weeks. It seems like we’ve gotten better each week. Our defense played really well last week. We didn’t help them with a few turnovers, but, overall, I think we’re playing the best football we have all season. We just have to find a way to pull a couple games out there in the end.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:07:44.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
