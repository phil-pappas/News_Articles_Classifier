Olympics chief Thomas Bach says \"enough is enough\" at FIFA, the troubled global soccer body facing an unprecedented leadership crisis after its president and top leaders were suspended Thursday in a continuing corruption scandal.\n\"We hope that now, finally, everyone at FIFA has at last understood that they cannot continue to remain passive,\" the president of the International Olympics Committee said in a statement Thursday. \"They must act swiftly to regain credibility because you cannot forever dissociate the credibility of FIFA from the credibility of football.\"\nIt's unclear who can lead soccer's governing body now that Sepp Blatter, its president since 1998, was suspended for 90 days on Thursday by FIFA's ethics committee. Blatter's lieutenant, Jerome Valcke, was also suspended 90 days, along with Michel Platini, one of the men lining up to possibly replace Blatter in presidential elections planned for February.\n\"FIFA must realize that this is now about more than just a list of candidates,\" Bach said. \"This is also a structural problem and will not be solved simply by the election of a new president.\"\nRELATED: FIFA SUSPENDS JACK WARNER FOR LIFE\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nBach, a German, took charge of the IOC last year and instituted a series of reforms meant to modernize the Games.\n\"They must do two things immediately,\" Bach said of FIFA. \"They must accelerate and deepen the reform process in order to comply with accountability, transparency and all the principles of good governance...They should also be open for a credible external presidential candidate of high integrity, to accomplish the necessary reforms and bring back stability and credibility to FIFA.\"\nThe IOC has counted Blatter as a member for years, but the 79-year-old Swiss declined to renew his membership this July as the FIFA scandal intensified. The IOC suffered its own corruption crisis in the late 1990s following revelations of bribery related to bidding for the rights to host Olympic Games.\nBoth the IOC and FIFA are based in Switzerland, as are many of the international sports federations that fall under the Olympic umbrella. Legislators there have recently enacted laws allowing more scrutiny of the finances of sport executives.\nRelated Stories FIFA officially bans Blatter, Valcke and Platini for 90 days Lionel Messi will be tried on three counts of tax fraud Tags: fifa", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:08:20.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
