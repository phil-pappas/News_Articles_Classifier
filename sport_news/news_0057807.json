He has visited Syracuse, Florida State and Oregon. He is going to Colorado this weekend, and that will be followed by a trip to UCLA.\nBlunt is also considering Texas Tech, where his brother Clark and sister Bailey are on the track roster. He hopes to make his college choice by Nov. 11, the first day of the early signing period.\nBlunt won 5A state titles in the 1,600 (personal-best time of 4:10.35) and 3,200 meters (9:02.98) in May. But his track season continued into June as he competed at the New Balance Nationals, where he won the two-mile race in 8:58.03 and took second in the mile in 4:10.74.\n\"I was taking a big chunk out of my summer base training, so I've just kind of been building up and trying to get prepared for my postseason [cross country meets],\" Blunt said.\nHe will return to competition at the District 9-5A meet Oct. 15. He isn't worried about the long stretch between races.\n\"It has been nice not having to race and not having to worry about being recovered and ready to race each weekend,\" Blunt said. \"I can use each week as training. It's nice to have a break, and when the racing does come, I think I'll be a lot better off.\"\nBlunt is trying to become the first boy in UIL history to win state titles in cross country and the 1,600 and 3,200 in track in three straight seasons.\nOn Twitter:\n @DMNGregRiddle", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DMNGregRiddle"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T17:35:51.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
