Afterwards, she said she had designs on becoming world No. 1. \nThe Spaniard is just one point behind world No. 3 Maria Sharapova, who withdrew from the China Open with a left forearm injury. Bacsinszky also cracked the top 10 for the first time as she jumped up seven places from 17th. \nHowever Muguruza, who has also qualified for the year-ending WTA Finals in Singapore later this month, has dropped out of the Hong Kong Open with an ankle injury — clearing a big obstacle for Williams. \nThe American is currently 11th in the wide-open Road to Singapore rankings, but she still has a chance of reaching the eight-player season finale. \n“The field is really deep, there’s a lot of top players but I feel like I have a good opportunity,” Williams said yesterday ahead of her first-round match against Ukrainian lucky loser Yuliya Beygelzimer. \nAlso today, world No. 10 Angelique Kerber will take on former French Open winner Francesca Schiavone, and ex-world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic plays Romanian qualifier Ana Bogdan. \nYesterday’s first-round matches saw Spain’s Lara Arruabarrena, Lee Ya-hsuan of Chinese Taipei and Puerto Rican Monica Puig all advance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:41:38.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
