Carver’s season, and it’s all come to this. \nThe Wolverines host Wetumpka at 7 p.m. Thursday for the final playoff spot in Class 6A, Region 2. The winner moves on, while the loser stays home. \nIt’s games like this where you need your best players to step up. Carver’s five-star Lyndell “Mack” Wilson is the No. 1 rated outside linebacker in the country. He has offers from the top programs in the country, and he’s an Under Armour All-American. \nCoach Billy Gresham said it’s time for Wilson to show everyone why. \n“(I expect) his best football game of his career. He’s one of those guys, I told him, ‘He’s had it easy since he’s been here.’ Other guys have led him to the playoffs and region titles. And now, he’s the five-star, he’s our best football player. So we look forward to him and watching how he responds with his back against the wall, and the team’s back against the wall,” Gresham said. “It’s these type of games where players like him, you really see why you’re a five-star football player, and why you’re All-State and why you get all the accolades that you get. You really have to come to play.” \nGresham’s challenged Wilson before. He moved him from quarterback to linebacker, telling him he could be one of the best players in the country. He moved linebacker positions as a junior to fill team needs. \nThis year, the best outside linebacker in the country has been playing inside linebacker, along with his punting duties. \nHe knows what’s at stake, and he’s ready to show everyone what he’s made of. \n“It’s the moment we’ve been living for as a team. We’ve had chance after chance, and this is our only chance we have left. We’re just trying our best to take advantage of it,” Wilson said. “I like challenges. I never back down from one. Every time coach puts me up for a challenge, I go out and play a great game. I’m going to be high energy. I’m going to be ready to go out and play ball with my teammates.” \nIt won’t be just Wilson leaving it all out there. The Wolverines have frequently gone to their bag of tricks this season to turn the momentum. Gresham said he’d only run two trick plays since 2008 leading up to the season, but is 10-for-11 in 2015. \n“Everything that’ll give us an advantage to win in the football game, we’re not going to hold anything back. They know that. We’ve got to put all our eggs in this one game, and live with the results in the end,” Gresham said. “It’s just one of those years. You’ve got a feel of what you have, and you try to take advantage and put our kids in a position to be successful.” 18 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RXfpuz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:52:45.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
