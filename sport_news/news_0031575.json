A. Dickey, the team’s knuckleballer, was asked about his preparation for a potential Game 4. It must be difficult, one reporter noted, to prepare for a game that might never happen.\n“Why wouldn’t it happen?” Dickey asked with a straight face.\nDickey was being playful, and he knew the answer. If the Blue Jays lost Game 3, the best-of-five series would have been over with the Texas Rangers in the American League Championship Series and the Blue Jays on vacation. But Toronto beat the Rangers, 5-1, on Sunday and forced a Game 4 on Monday, which Dickey is scheduled to pitch.\nIt was the first postseason win by the Blue Jays since they won the 1993 World Series, and it saves Dickey from missing out on the fun.\n“I will be very, very disappointed and sad if I don’t get a chance to pitch in the postseason,” Dickey said before the game, almost as a warning.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Dodgers’ Chase Utley Is Suspended for Two Games for Slide OCT. 11, 2015 Sports of The Times: Mets’ Latest Run-In With Chase Utley Threatens to Derail a Series OCT. 11, 2015 On Baseball: It’s Unsafe at Second, and Some Want New Rules for Slides OCT. 11, 2015 Astros 4, Royals 2: Dallas Keuchel Stays Unbeaten at Home as the Astros Close In on Clinching OCT. 11, 2015 Keeping Score: Match for Jake Arrieta’s Second Half: A Giant’s Forgotten Season of 1916 OCT. 11, 2015 But he could smile late Sunday night. The Blue Jays, once favored to win the World Series, live on thanks in part to a strong performance by Dickey’s fellow starting pitcher Marco Estrada and a three-run home run by Troy Tulowitzki in the sixth inning, his first postseason home run since the 2007 National League division series with the Colorado Rockies.\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\n“Maybe that sets him off,” Jays Manager John Gibbons said of Tulowitzki. “If he catches fire, we’re real dangerous.”\nEstrada was making his fifth appearance in the postseason (the previous four were with Milwaukee) but his first start. He allowed one run in six and a -third innings and struck out four while refusing to yield a walk. He took the ball with the Blue Jays on the brink of elimination and did well enough to get the ball to Dickey on Monday afternoon.\nIt will be Dickey’s first appearance in the postseason after 13 regular seasons, and it will come against the team he started his career with, the team where he learned to throw the knuckleball, a pitch that prolonged his career by roughly a decade. Dickey, one of the more literary athletes, called it poetic to be starting here and said, “It’s a neat narrative.”\nBut the challenge is still difficult. The Blue Jays are attempting to become the third team to lose the first two games of a best-of-five series at home and then go on to win it. The 2001 Yankees lost the first two games of their division series with the Oakland Athletics and came back to win, and the 2012 San Francisco Giants lost the first two games of their series with the Cincinnati Reds and also came back to win.\nThe Blue Jays scored their first run on Sunday in the third inning when they were still searching for an offensive breakout. Dioner Navarro, starting at catcher for Toronto in place of Russell Martin, smacked a double over the head of Texas center fielder Delino DeShields. Kevin Pillar followed with an infield single and Navarro went to third and then scored on a double-play ball off the bat of Ryan Goins.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The Blue Jays scored another run in the fourth inning, but Navarro hit into a double play preventing them from doing further damage to the Rangers starter, Martin Perez. After the play, Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor skipped off the diamond pumping his fist.\nToronto had another good opportunity to add to their lead in the fifth, but were victims of an unusual play. Pillar led off with a single to center, and took second base when Rangers’ center fielder Delino DeShields missed the ball. Pillar went to third on a sacrifice, bringing the leadoff batter, Ben Revere to the plate. Revere swung at a pitch and the ball shattered his bat with Pillar running on contact. The ball stayed aloft and Odor ran in and caught it and threw it to third base to double off Pillar, who threw his hands in the air in frustration.\nA fourth double play in the sixth seemed at the time to be almost too much for the Blue Jays to bear. They had the bases loaded with nobody out, but Chris Colabello hit a sharp bouncing ball to Mitch Moreland at first base. Moreland had plenty of time to throw home to get the force there and the catcher Robinson Chirinos made the relay back to Moreland for the double play.\nThe Blue Jays might have been completely dispirited, if not for Tulowitzki’s blast. He lined up a full-count changeup from reliever Chi Chi Gonzalez and sent it into the seats in left field to up the Blue Jays lead to 5-0.\nThe Rangers scored a run in the seventh, but failed to add more when reliever Mark Lowe struck out Chirinos to end the inning with a runner at third.\nNow the Blue Jays, who won 93 games in the regular season, have a chance to even the series in Game 4 Monday afternoon. Dickey, who spoke at length before the game, was asked to compare the challenge of winning three straight games against the Rangers (the first two in Texas) with climbing the highest mountain in Africa.\nIt may seem an odd comparison, but Dickey was part of an expedition that climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in 2012, when he was with the Mets.\n“Well, I don’t feel as nauseous as I did when I was halfway up the mountain, that’s for sure,” Dickey said. “You know, like I said before, this is not an insurmountable peak.”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/12/sports/12ASTROS/12ASTROS-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/11/sports/12POWELL/12POWELL-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/12/sports/12kepner4/12kepner4-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/12/sports/12SCORE1/12SCORE1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/12/sports/12METSWEB/12METSWEB-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:24:37.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
