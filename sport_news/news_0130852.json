Watkins was sidelined after hurting his right calf in a win at Miami on Sunday. \nStarting right guard John Miller (groin) missed his second straight practice. Safety Aaron Williams (neck) practiced on a limited basis, and has a chance to play after missing one game. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:58:39.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
