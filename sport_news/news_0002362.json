Posted: Friday, October 23, 2015 1:55 am | Updated: 2:23 am, Fri Oct 23, 2015. \nBy DANIEL McKILLOP \nThe Daily News \nBULLHEAD CITY — The T-birds will be shooting for their fourth win in five games at 7 tonight at Mohave High School against the Bulldogs. \nThe 3-5 overall, No. 20-ranked Arizona Interscholastic Association Division IV T-birds, will enter the football game with a 3-2 Section III record after defeating the Volunteers 27-20 at Lee Williams High School on Oct. 9. \nThe T-birds sit in third place trailing first-place, No. 4-ranked Lake Havasu and second-place, No. 9-ranked River Valley high schools, which are 5-0 in section, respectively, with two games remaining in the regular season. The top 16 Division IV squads will earn a state playoff berth. \nThe No. 36-ranked 1-7 overall, 0-5 Division IV, Section III Kingman High School squad is in last place in section. \nThere are 42 Division IV high schools in the AIA. \nFour Division IV high schools stand between Mohave and a playoff berth. Thatcher is ranked No. 19 and is 5-3, \nGlendale is 4-4 and is ranked No. 18, Dysart is 5-3 and is ranked No. 17, and Pueblo Magnet is 5-3 and is ranked No. 16. \nT-birds senior Jason Urquiza, who was suffering from the flu, but played anyway, gained 201 yards on 37 carries with two TD runs, which kept Mohave in the game before senior quarterback Oliver Syme tossed the game-winning 20-yard TD pass to senior tight end Matt McKee with 2:53 left in the fourth quarter. \nSyme also tossed a 5-yard pass to senior Michael Stahlman, who dodged one tackler and beat two defenders 33 more yards to the end zone for a 38-yard catch-and-run TD. \nStahlman went on to catch five passes for 73 yards. \n“He does all of the intangibles,” said T-birds acting head coach Rudy Olvera about Stahlman. “He’s at practice every day, he works hard, he’s a quick kid, a smart kid. \n“He just does what we ask of him.” \nMohave trailed 20-19 after McKee missed the PAT with 3:31 left in the third quarter. \n“After missing the second PAT,” McKee said, “Coach Olvera told me, ‘Don’t let this affect the rest of the game; we’re going to keep doing our thing and forget about it.’ ” \nWhen asked if catching the game-winning touchdown pass helped McKee redeem himself after missing two extra points, Olvera said, “I told him that after he missed the second one I pulled him aside I told him aside and told him, ‘not to hang his head because because you’re going to have an opportunity to win the game for us.’ \n“I didn’t know whether it was going to be a field goal. \n“If it was going to be a little more difficult field goal ... I didn’t know (if) he’s got the range.” \n“But I decided to go for it on fourth down rather than kick it. \n“I told him that. ...” \nMcKee added: “After scoring the winning touchdown, it didn’t feel any different than any of the others. \n“It wasn’t something special I did, it was the whole team doing their jobs to make it happen. \n“The line gave him the time to sit in the pocket and make the throw.” \nMohave lineman Mason Phillips recorded two sacks during Lee Williams’ final drive to help the T-birds preserve their lead. \nOlvera said the Bulldogs are “gritty” despite their record. \nBulldogs quarterback Nate Sinclair runs the Kingman offense pretty well, Olvera said. \n“They have an explosive running back (Isiah Perez),” Olvera said. “I’ve seen him break a few.” \nOlvera added: “Their free safety Garrett Stephens loves to get his nose in the mix.” \nKingman defensive end Julian Nelson has a “motor.” \nEXTRA POINT: Urquiza is 100 percent and is expected to play against Kingman. \nStatistics courtesy of maxpreps and aiaonline.org .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:14:00.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
