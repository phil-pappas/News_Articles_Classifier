After finishing in third place in the National League Central, the Cubs have beaten the two teams that finished ahead of them in the division — the Pittsburgh Pirates and the St. Louis Cardinals — in back-to-back rounds. Chicago advanced to the NL Championship Series with a 6-4 victory over the Cardinals in Game 4 of the NL Division Series on Tuesday night, leading President Obama to congratulate the team from the North Side: The Cubs appreciated the support: You may recall that President Obama chose not to follow the Cubs when he first joined Twitter earlier this year. However, he has since started following the club. Now, not only is Mr. President a follower, but he's a bit of a supporter — for the time being, at least.
