Most were either in the room or were already inducted. \nMany UCA icons got one more tribute, one more emotional pat on the back from those representing the fruits of their labors. \nAfter recognizing his family in rapid-fire fashion, former Conway High coach and athletic director Buzz Bolding said saluted his UCA coach, the late Raymond Bright, and former UCA physical education teacher university president, the late Jeff Farris. \n“Coach Bright taught us to respect everyone from the president to the equipment manager,” Bolding said. “Jeff Farris emphasized to us P.E. majors that it wasn’t PE, that we were physical educators. I tried to follow that throughout my career. I’m proud to be one of Raymond’s boys.” \nAfter former Sugar Bear coach Ron Marvel noted in a video tribute that Carone Harris, one of the best and most dynamic players in UCA women’s basketball history, “had possibly the highest basketball IQ of any player I ever coached.” \nHarris, who won three games on a last-second shot, in turn praised Marvel for taking a chance on a youngster from a small Arkansas community of about 500 (Bradley). When she had a child in college, Marvel and his wife became babysitters and surrogate parents. \n“He and his wife took care of my child like it was their own,” she said. \nCaronica Randle, fourth on UCA’s career scoring list and a teammate of Harris, also singled out Marvel and Checola Seals-Horton, both of her UCA coaches. “Coach Marvel and coach Seals believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself,” said Randle, a former Sugar Bear assistant who is currently an assistant at Marshall University. \nJody Musgrove, a former track star at UCA, praised his coach and another UCA Hall of Famer, Bill Nutter, and how he modeled his coaching style as a girls basketball coach at Lonoke after him. “Coach Nutter brought out the best in all of us,” he said. “I still remember running those bleachers to get into shape. I remember my teammates, many of whom were not only the best at UCA but the best in the state and that includes Arkansas and Arkansas State.” \nDavid Henson, who starred on UCA’s 1991 national championship football team and was a ninth-round draft choice of the Arizona Cardinals that year, talked about Hall of Fame coach Harold Horton and how he influenced him to come to UCA after he decided to transfer from the University of Arkansas. \n“Listening to coach Horton talk football is like hearing Morgan Freeman tell a story,” he said. “He told me that if I came to UCA, I wouldn’t regret it and I have never regretted it. My coaches here were not only coaches — but mentors, confidants and sometimes fathers.” \nAllen Perry, a football and baseball star, double-teamed on Horton, noting that he coached at Forrest City while he was a young child growing up there. He said his father asked Horton for a pair of football shoes — the Johnny Unitas high-tops popular in the day. When he got them, they were way too large. “Coach Horton told me that as soon as I got big enough to wear them, I’d be mean enough to play,” he said. “And I thought Harold Horton was the meanest man I had seen in my life.” Perry went all to praise all of his coaches, Vance Strange, Jerry Joe Harrison, Jim Clark, Ken Stephens and John Outlaw, and cited special things each had taught him. \nClyde Traylor, a basketball and baseball star, saluted coaches Clyde Horton and Rex Lovell for giving him the chance to play baseball at UCA. He was the leading hitter on three Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference championship baseball teams.“My only regret was I never got to play in the national tournament,” he said. “When UCA made the national (NCAA) tournament a couple of years ago and did well, I followed every game.” Coaches and family members weren’t the only ones to draw praise. Randle remembered UCA professor Doug Eisenhart “because he always brought candy to class and I liked candy.” With so much sweet praise going about Saturday, it was appropriate the event had a sugar coating. \n(Sports columnist David McCollum can be reached at 501-505-1235 or david.mccollum@thecabin.net )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:24:22.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
