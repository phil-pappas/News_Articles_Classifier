Perkins was scheduled to undergo an MRI earlier in the day. The Scout.com website added that there was no ligament damage.\nThe status of inside linebacker Isaako Savaiinaea, who was carted to the locker room with what appeared to be a serious leg injury, and receiver Devin Fuller (neck) are also unknown.\nMora’s scheduled day-after-game teleconference with reporters was canceled..\nPerkins left in the second quarter of Thursday’s game after he was hit just above his left knee by a Cal player’s helmet.\nTrainers tended to him for several minutes on the field, before he walked to the sideline without help. He was limping, though. After further examination, he rode a stationary bike, and did not return.\nIn place of Perkins, freshman Soso Jamabo carried the ball 18 times for 79 yards and one touchdown.\n“We’re just going to continue to get better,” Jamabo said after the game. “When he comes back, we’ll be ready to have him. We’ll welcome him with open arms, and we’ll be great.”\nPerkins’ backup, sophomore Nate Starks, also was out with a head injury sustained in a loss at Stanford on Oct. 15.\nLast season, Perkins led the Pac-12 in rushing (1,572 yards). Through seven games this fall, he has a team-high 754 yards and eight touchdowns, including 73 yards on 11 carries against Cal.\nContact the writer: jkaufman@ocregister.com\nRelated: Josh Rosen helps UCLA end two-game slide with 40-24 victory over Cal Five observations: UCLA 40, Cal 26 Five-star DE Wole Betiku decommits from UCLA", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/bruins-688832-rosen-ucla.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/ucla/ucla-688837-five-observations.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/ucla/betiku-688851-committed-twitter.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:09:27.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
