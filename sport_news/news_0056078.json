RUSSO\nAP College Football Writer\nMemphis and Temple jumped into The Associated Press college football poll for the first time this season, joining Houston to give the American Athletic Conference three ranked teams for the first time in the history of the three-year old league.\nOhio State remained No. 1 in the AP Top 25 released Sunday. For the second straight week, six teams received first-place votes in the media poll, led by the Buckeyes with 28. No. 2 Baylor has 12, No. 3 Utah received 16, No. 4 TCU got three and No. 5 LSU and No. 6 Clemson each have one.\nThe Utes and LSU Tigers each edged ahead one spot after home victories on Saturday.\nMichigan State stayed at No. 7 after its miracle against Michigan and Alabama is No. 8 after handing Texas A&M its first loss.\nMemphis (6-0) had the big upset of the weekend against Mississippi. The Tigers 37-24 victory vaulted them into the rankings at No 18. Unbeaten Temple moved to 6-0 and was ranked No. 22. No. 21 Houston is also 6-0.\nThe American is what is left of the old Big East football conference after realignment stripped it of many of its top schools, such as Pittsburgh, West Virginia and Louisville. Conference commissioner Mike Aresco kept the conference alive by wooing a handful of Conference USA teams, including Memphis and Houston, and adding former independent Navy this season to create a 12-team conference.\nThe switch from the BCS to the College Football Playoff helped bump the American into the Group of Five and out of the so-called power conferences that include the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12 and Southeastern Conference.\nBut the American has held its own against the Power Five this season, going 7-11 with wins against Penn State, Miami and Louisville.\nAresco called Memphis's victory against Mississippi the conference's most important of the season. The American is now well-positioned to earn the spot saved for the highest ranked champion from the Group of Five in the New Year's Six bowls.\nAnd who knows? If Memphis, Temple or Houston wins out, Aresco thinks the AAC champion should be in the conversation for a place in the playoff.\nCopyright redistributed.\nThe AP Top 25 is determined by a simple points system based on how each voter ranks college football's best teams. A team receives 25 points for each first place vote, 24 for second place and so on through to the 25th team, which receives one point. The rankings are set by listing the teams' point totals from highest to lowest. Fox 8's Garland Gillen is one of those voters.\nThis is Garland Gillen's 6th year as a voter for the Associated Press poll.\n AP TOP 25 RANK GARLAND GILLEN'S TOP 25 OHIO STATE 1 UTAH BAYLOT 2 OHIO STATE UTAH 3 CLEMSON TCU 4 BAYLOR LSU 5 LSU CLEMSON 6 TCU MICHIGAN STATE 7 FLORIDA STATE ALABAMA 8 ALABAMA FLORIDA STATE 9 MICHIGAN STATE STANFORD 10 IOWA NOTRE DAME 11 OKLAHOMA STATE IOWA 12 STANFORD FLORIDA 13 NOTRE DAME OKLAHOMA STATE 14 MEMPHIS TEXAS A&M 15 FLORIDA MICHIGAN 16 TEXAS A&M OKLAHOMA 17 HOUSTON MEMPHIS 18 MISSISSIPPI STATE TOLEDO 19 MICHIGAN CALIFORNIA 20 TOLEDO HOUSTON 21 OKLAHOMA TEMPLE 22 OLE MISS DUKE 23 DUKE OLE MISS 24 TEMPLE PITTSBURGH 25 CALIFORNIA\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
