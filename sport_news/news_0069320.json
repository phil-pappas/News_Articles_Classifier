(Chris Szagola / Associated Press) Helene Elliott Contact Reporter \nA Kings spokesman verified the payment and cap numbers associated with the settlement of the contract of Mike Richards, numbers first reported Thursday night by Elliotte Friedman of Hockey Night in Canada. \nThe Kings voided Richards’ contract, claiming a material breach. The NHL Players Assn. filed a grievance over that, and the two sides reached a settlement last week that will keep Richards’ payout on the Kings’ salary cap until the 2031-32 season. That's no typo: through the 2031-32 season. The Kings must also pay a cap recapture penalty. \nHere’s a link to Friedman’s story, and here’s a link to a chart by the folks at generalfanager.com that illustrates the Kings’ financial obligations each season and compares the settlement figures with what they would have owed him if they'd just bought him out. \nRichards is an unrestricted free agent. \nKings General Manager Dean Lombardi on Friday declined to comment on the publication of the settlement numbers. A team spokesman said Lombardi was ill and unable to meet with reporters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:42:41.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
