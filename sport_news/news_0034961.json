That's news to me,\" Ryan said Wednesday. \"That may or may not be the case. But it's certainly not official. So we'll see how it goes.\"\nAt practice, backup EJ Manuel took a majority of snaps with the starting offense as Buffalo (3-2) prepares to host Cincinnati (5-0).\nTaylor wore a brace on his knee while practicing on a limited basis three days after being hurt in a 14-13 win over Tennessee.\nThough he had no difficulty jogging in a straight line, Taylor was hampered when moving laterally during the 20-minute portion of practice open to reporters.\n\"I don't see it as a big deal,\" Taylor said, referring to moving sideways. \"To me, it feels better than it did yesterday whether it's moving straight ahead of moving laterally as well.\"\nWhen it comes to the possibility of playing against the Bengals, Taylor said \"that's the plan,\" and added, \"I'm comfortable with me going out there and playing the way I'm feeling right now.\"\nHe said he had no issues planting his feet while attempting passes, and didn't rule out the possibility of wearing a brace.\nIn other Bills news, starting safety Aaron Williams will miss at least eight weeks because of a neck injury after being placed on the reserve-injured designated to return list on Wednesday.\nThe move comes after Williams aggravated the injury and missed a few plays in a 14-13 win at Tennessee on Sunday.\nJets: Defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson was a full participant at practice Wednesday after being limited Monday because of sore ribs. Wilkerson said Tuesday he would be fine to play against Washington on Sunday. X-rays on his ribs were negative. Guard Willie Colon (knee) and linebacker David Harris (quadriceps) were limited. Colon missed the Jets' game against Miami in London, but coach Todd Bowles says he has a shot at returning this weekend. Rookie defensive end Leonard Williams (ankle) fully practiced after being hurt late against the Dolphins. Safety Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee), wide receiver Chris Owusu (knee) and cornerback Marcus Williams (hamstring) didn't practice.
