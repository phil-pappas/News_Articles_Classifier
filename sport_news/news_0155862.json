In all, Fukuda is said to have lost over $8,000. \nThe 32-year-old did not appear for the top team this season, so there is no suspicion that he fixed games, but gambling is a violation of NPB's charter. \nIn light of the revelations, team president Hiroshi Kubo on Tuesday launched an investigation involving all players and staff. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:22:35.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
