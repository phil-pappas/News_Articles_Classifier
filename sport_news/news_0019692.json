Next year five races will take place on Bermuda waters in M32s, which are considered the next generation of catamaran racing. \n“These races are in addition to the two sailing events announced last month – RC44 in March 2016 and the Flying Phantom races in November of this year. Organisers of these race events say they wanted to come to Bermuda because it is the home of the America’s Cup. \n“Four of the five new M32 races will take place in the first quarter of 2016, the fifth in April. The high-tech M32 catamarans will be stored in Bermuda with owners and relative parties flying in and out of the island.” \n“The M32 dates are: January 8-10; February 26-28; March 5-6; March 11-13; and April 15-17. Meantime, the biennial Annapolis Bermuda Race is returning and will launch from Maryland on June 10, 2016. \n“Since Bermuda was named home of the America’s Cup, seven international races have been introduced to the island. The list includes Flying Phantom, RC44, and five M32 races over a span of four months. \n“The BTA was part of the original bid team creating the proposal to land the America’s Cup and has also been a partner in landing other events for Bermuda.” \nThe BTA today released an updated Sailing Tourism Calendar, which is below: Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:38:12.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
