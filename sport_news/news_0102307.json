You can look at things a couple different ways. Were they tired? Everyone during the course of the season is physically going to get worn down because it’s a grind. But one of my oldest players played as much as anyone and thrived in the situation: Carlos Beltran.”\nOn his job performance: \n“With the information in front of me being prepared and the discussions that I had with my coaches, I did what I thought was right every day. The bottom line is we didn’t win, so that’s going to be questioned. (But) we’re not so sure that would have worked any better. I did the best I could… People thought that I could have done better and I understand that, so you live with it.”\nOn the possibility that his veterans tired in the second half: \n“Maybe do you try to do something different next year in these situations? It’s something that I’ll think long and hard about in the winter. We do have a lot of players in their prime, what would be considered their prime years.’’\nOn the perception that Dellin Betances was over-used: \n“I was cognizant of his workload. I studied his workload the year he was in Triple-A and had so much success out of the bullpen. When I look at what happened to Dellin, he had a human month. We’ve seen other great relievers have a human month.’’\nOn the benching of Jacoby Ellsbury in the wild-card game: \n“As far as fence mending, that’s to be determined, I guess, as I talk through things with players over the course of the winter. I had to make a decision (to play Chris Young over Ellsbury or Brett Gardner against Houston). It wasn’t an easy decision (and) it came down to a body of work during the course of the season against left-handers.’’\nOn his hopes for 2016: \n“It’s pretty plain and simple – to win the World Series. So whatever that takes, that’s what my wish list is.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:45:06.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
