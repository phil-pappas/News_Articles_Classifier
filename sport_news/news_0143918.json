I’ve never seen anybody with a work ethic like him.”\nShore, a consensus top-five golfer in the national and world junior rankings, fired a 69 Thursday on the River Course at windy, rain-swept Sevierville Golf Club to successfully defend his region title.\nPhoto gallery: Scenes from the tournament Shore and the Warriors carded a team score of 301 to earn a return trip to the state tournament Oct. 13-14 at WillowBrook Golf Club in Manchester.\nFreshman Cade Russell recorded a 72 while juniors Tyler Young and Preston Burleson shot 79 and 81, respectively, as CAK repeated as region champ.\nCatholic (311) was second and Alcoa (329) third.\nThe first-place team and the top four individual finishers not on the winning team advanced to the state tournament.\n“It was a good day for us,” said Fennell, whose boys finished second in the state a year ago. “Our goal was to try and break 300, and we shot 301, which is still pretty solid in these conditions with the rain and the wind.\n“Davis wasn’t very happy with his 69, which is a barometer that shows you how hard the course was playing in these conditions.”\nShore, who was medalist last year at the state tournament, said the weather definitely impacted the scoring.\n“It was windy, a little chilly and the course was really wet,” the junior said. “It was tough because of that, and I was playing conservative.”\nShore said a team state championship has been a goal all season. The Warriors fell just short a year ago, finishing second by three strokes to Christ Presbyterian Academy.\nCAK last won a boys state golf championship in 2010.\n“I really hope the team can win state this year,” Shore said. “I think we have a great chance.”\nFennell said the Warriors head to state on a high note after Thursday’s showing.\n“Davis is on top of his game, and the weather even makes Cade’s 72 even more impressive. He was really solid today,” he said. “We’re looking forward to getting back to state. We were so close last year. We’re hungry for another opportunity.”\nOther individuals advancing to state play are Grace Christian’s Luke Scealf (74), Kingston’s Brady Davis (75), Catholic’s Eli Cox (76) and Carter’s Jake Mynatt (76).\nCAK made it a clean sweep as the Lady Warriors took both team and individual honors.\nCAK junior Caroline Cavin had a 1-over-par 71 on the Highlands Course to medal.\nCavin, who had five birdies and six bogeys, said a disappointing showing in the district tournament (83) was just the inspiration she needed.\nCAK girls coach Donnie Cooper said Cavin bounced back strong.\n“She really hit it well and executed off the tee today,” Cooper said.\nCAK’s Emma Wasson overcame a triple bogey on the first hole to finish with a 77 as the Lady Warriors won with a team score of 148.\nUnion County (181) was second and Oneida (189) third.\nOther individuals to qualify for state were Kaitlyn Sneed (75) of Meigs County, Savannah Szozda (77) of Kingston, Emily Hutson (85) of Oneida and Kayla Williams (90) of Union County.\nMike Blackerby is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:27:36.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
