First, a video of Ray Rice punching his wife was released by TMZ Sports . Then, Adrian Peterson was indicted on child abuse-related charges . And, well, yeah. We don’t need to remind you about everything that happened next , do we? It was a nightmare for the league.\nSeptember 2015 was dramatically different. As reporter Mike Rosenberg pointed out yesterday, there were no NFL players arrested over the last month. Zero. It’s the first time since July 2009 that the league had an entire month go by without an arrest—and it’s just the second time it has happened since Roger Goodell took over as league commissioner in 2006:\nNFL just finished a calendar month without any player arrests reported. That hadn't happened in more than 6 years.\n— Mike Rosenberg (@RosenbergMerc) October 1, 2015 September was just 2nd month without an NFL player arrest reported since Roger Goodell began as commissioner in 2006. Other was July 2009.\n— Mike Rosenberg (@RosenbergMerc) October 1, 2015 And September was the first time in 15 years that the NFL went a calendar month *during the season* without a player arrest.\n— Mike Rosenberg (@RosenbergMerc) October 1, 2015 So…congratulations? It might seem silly to celebrate this, but it’s worth noting that the NFL has more than 1,500 active players in it. So it actually is kind of amazing that none of them got arrested for anything at all last month.\nLet’s see if they can keep it up in October.\n Deadspin ]", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RosenbergMerc/status/649667731680169985", "http://deadspin.com/the-nfl-went-a-calendar-month-without-an-arrest-for-the-1734238830", "https://twitter.com/RosenbergMerc/status/649631776533405696", "https://twitter.com/RosenbergMerc/status/649705958428381184"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:25:29.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
