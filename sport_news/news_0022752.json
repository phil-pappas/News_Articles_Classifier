Mefford, Josh Sage and Buck Purtee rounded out the top five. \n“It was a lot of work tonight,” Poore said in the AutoFarm McCrocklin Ford winner’s circle. “The car was handling right; it was loose in the corners. \n“I was surprised I was able to pull away after the caution, but I think Brandon (Mefford) was racing Calvin (Parham) pretty hard for second,” he said. \nDuring the first half of the race, the best battle on the track was for third, involving Mefford, Owens, Cook and visiting Ohio driver Sage. \nMefford finally was able to claim the spot on Lap 25 with an inside move coming off the third corner. \nLate Model feature \nJack Dossey III showed a lot of patience for the first 40 laps of the McGunegill Engine Performance Late Model 75-lap feature as he pursued Danny Trent. \nWith Dossey looking for a way around Trent, Greg VanAlst closed on the leaders with Jeff Marcum running a close fourth. \nTrent appeared to have a brief mechanical problem on Lap 44 coming off the fourth corner, which allowed both Dossey and VanAlst to slip past. \nFor the final 31 laps, VanAlst kept the pressure on Dossey, but came up a half-second short with Marcum, Trent and Josh Timmerman rounding out the top five. \n“I race against great competitors,” Dossey said. “They both raced me clean. The car wasn’t quite where we wanted it tonight. \n“I had to work for the win tonight,” he said. It was his seventh feature win of the 2015 season. \nFollow Ken de la Bastide on Twitter @KendelaBastide, or call 640-4863.
