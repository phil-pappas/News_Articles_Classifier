No surprise, he said Monday that game is a great memory of his. \n\"It was a fun one,\" Falk said. \"First college start on the road, to get a win like that.\" \nThat game helped set Falk on the trajectory he is now. He went into the offseason as the presumptive starter for Mike Leach, and has played well in his first full season behind the wheel of Mike Leach's offense. \n\"I think anytime you get success, you know what it feels like, you want to get back to that,\" Falk said. \"I think that helped me work back to that place of getting a win \n\"Any win feels good to me, so it was nice to get that my first start.\" \n\"The biggest thing you saw is he played really composed,\" Leach added. \"He does a good job of that. \"He played composed down the stretch this last game (at Oregon) and in overtime, and did that against Oregon State.\" \nFalk also showed a flair for the dramatic in Washington State's last minute comeback win at Rutgers. \n\"You think about all the situations everyone wants to be in as a quarterback, Tom Brady moments and stuff like that, he's kinda that guy,\" wide receiver Gabe Marks said. \nMarks said Falk's success in Corvallis in 2014 started well before he was tasked with filling in for an injured Connor Halliday. \n\"He's here before everyone and he leaves after everyone, which is kinda cliche for a quarterback but it's actually true,\" Marks said. \"I don't know if he's doing it to be cliche or not.\" \n\"I think his work ethic gives him credibility with the players,\" Leach added.
