Owners discussed the matter in league meetings Wednesday and are hopeful a vote can be taken in January.\nThe league has yet to endorse either of the two proposals -- the Chargers / Raiders plan for Carson, Calif., or the Rams plan for Inglewood -- but owners had what Commissioner Roger Goodell called “thoughtful” conversation on the topic for two hours and began shaping what the NFL's relocation guidelines might look like.\nSteelers owner Art Rooney said in a statement that he expected a vote on a franchise or two moving to LA in January. While Rooney, from one of football's most influential families and a member of the league's Los Angeles committee, cautioned that “nothing is for sure,” his belief that the matter will come to a vote shortly after the season speaks to the league's desire to resolve this issue. Owners have long maintained privately that the NFL would not conduct a vote without knowing one of the proposals had the requisite 24 votes of support.\n“I think there will be a vote,” Rooney said.\nThere had been mounting speculation that the NFL might expedite this process and allow teams to formally file for relocation during the season, but Rooney said that will not take place and that teams will have a window to “submit [applications] right after the season.”\nEric Grubman, the NFL executive who is the point person on the LA process, stressed that the league has not set a relocation fee yet and admitted there is much negotiating that still needs to be done, both with the cities of San Diego, St. Louis and Oakland, as well as with the owners looking to leave those markets before a deal is struck.\nWhile the expectation is that voting takes place in January, there are contingencies to alter that timeframe should one of the teams seeking to move be in the playoffs, or should a city be near a new stadium deal but require a few more weeks.\n“Are we so committed to January that we couldn't delay it? No,” Grubman said, answering his own question.\nGrubman said the league recently received a terms sheet from San Diego detailing the potential financing of a stadium there, but he is awaiting one from St. Louis. That city has issues to resolve regarding the public funding for a new complex, while the San Diego stadium may require a vote in June, by which time the relocation process could be long completed.\nWhile some owners expressed said privately there is a chance this matter could be pushed back until 2017, they also noted the momentum and progress being made and some owners believe the Chargers/Raiders project may only be 4-6 votes short of getting the support it requires.\nThe league will continue to explore options possibly pairing the Chargers and Rams in Inglewood, sources said, though that could prove quite difficult. The matter is likely to be discussed in greater detail in a December meeting and Grubman said at this point there is no schedule for a special meeting, which would eventually be called to actually vote on the LA move.\nThe owners did vote to expand the NFL's international series of regular-season games through at least 2025 and Goodell mentioned Mexico and Germany as possible destinations to hold games outside of the UK, where the league expects to play at least three more games in 2016. Sources said it is likely the NFL plays in Mexico City next year and could begin looking for teams to volunteer for that game shortly. Will the Raiders jilt Oakland and head to Los Angeles? We could know by early next year.
