I think the biggest guy on the team jumped on top at the end.\" \nHaddonfield goalie Jon Baxter was injured on the play and stayed on the turf for several minutes after the game. \nIn a good show of sportsmanship, McElroy approached Baxter on the Haddonfield bench after the game to check on him. \nMcElroy, a defender, said the Vikings' defense was the key to the victory. \nEastern withstood several flurries of pressure from Haddonfield. \nHaddonfield, the No. 4 seed, (16-1-1) did the same against Eastern's pressure. \n\"The overwhelming take-away for me is pride in my guys,\" Haddonfield coach Ryan Nixon said. \"That (Eastern) is one of the best Group 4 teams in this end of the state and it was dead-even. \n\"We had chances. They had chances. It could have gone either way. \n\"If I know my guys, this could be the catalyst to a great run (in the state tournament).\" \nHaddonfield broke to a 1-0 lead on a great goal by sophomore Jack Dugan, who showed poise in traffic before burying a blast a little over five minutes into the game. \nEastern tied the score at 1-1 with 4:27 left before halftime when Diego Valle converted a cross from Tanner Koch. \nEastern 1 0 1 - 2 \nHaddonfield 1 0 0 - 1 \nGoals: E-Diego Valle, Tom McElroy; H-Jack Dugan. \nSaves: E-Gabe Sable, 6; H-Jon Baxter, 7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:11:00.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
