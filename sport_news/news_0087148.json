Daniel White | Staff Photographer Purchase Photo | Photos from the St. Francis at Montini Catholic football game Friday, October 9, 2015 in Wheaton. Daniel White | Staff Photographer \nThis is what DuPage County football players have been working so long for: the playoffs. \nThrough winter weightlifting, through summer 7-on-7s, through preseason practices and nine weeks of the regular season, local football players have been working for the day when they learned where and against whom they play in the postseason. Story Continues Below \nHere's how it breaks down: \nDuPage County's Class 8A qualifiers \nNo. 14 Hinsdale Central (7-2) \nFirst-round opponent: vs. No. 19 Neuqua Valley (6-3) \nThe resume: The Red Devils' second loss Friday, to Oak Park, cost them a few seeds, but they still get a first-round home game for a second straight year. They've been pretty dominant offensively with quarterback Michael Sessa, who came into the weekend with 1,481 passing yards and 16 touchdowns. Combined with running back Christian Bobak, Hinsdale Central has an offense that rivals nearly every 8A team. Until last season's first-round victory over Benet, the Red Devils hadn't won a playoff game since 2008. \nThe draw: The impact of Friday's loss on the seeding is irrelevant now, although seeing unbeaten Edwardsville possibly awaiting in the second round isn't good. Hinsdale Central faces a Neuqua Valley team also sliding into the playoffs with two straight losses. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 30 Waubonsie Valley (5-4) at No. 3 Edwardsville (9-0) winner. \nNo. 19 Neuqua Valley (6-3) \nFirst-round opponent: at No. 14 Hinsdale Central (7-2) \nThe resume: The Wildcats have reached the playoffs six straight years and 12 of the last 14 seasons with semifinal and quarterfinal berths in 2012-13, respectively. A Week 2 loss at Naperville Central and Friday's loss to Glenbard North bring no shame. Isaiah Robertson and Owen Piche, juniors who play receiver and defensive back, have mad skills, though run balance has been sought all season. A 3-5 defense offering linebackers Nick Osikowicz, Casey Larson and Anthony Ippolito has flexibility, power and speed. \nThe draw: In 2006 No. 15 Hinsdale Central's 11-7 win over No. 2 Neuqua Valley in an 8A opener was a sore spot for years. The time for revenge may be over, but the lure of possibly playing Waubonsie Valley again, or Naperville Central in the quarters, is intriguing. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 30 Waubonsie Valley (5-4) at No. 3 Edwardsville (9-0) winner. \nNo. 30 Waubonsie Valley (5-4) \nFirst-round opponent: at No. 3 Edwardsville (9-0) \nThe resume: The Warriors make their ninth straight appearance and 19th overall. They've endured a Jekyll-Hyde season, dealing Naperville Central its sole loss and beating Glenbard North but losing to three sub-.500 teams. The triple-option offense still can strike at any time with star running back-linebacker Max Ihry. Waubonsie hung its hat on defense, which finished third in the DuPage Valley Conference with 114 points allowed. Sophomores Josh Dominiak, Derric Lee and Kyle Schroeder developed quickly. \nThe draw: Here's a road trip special from the new 1-32 seeding process. Edwardsville beat five playoff teams by a cumulative score of 160-55. If Waubonsie prevails it potentially sees familiar faces in regular-season foes Neuqua Valley and Naperville Central. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 19 Neuqua Valley (6-3) at No. 14 Hinsdale Central (7-2) winner. \nNo. 6 Naperville Central (8-1) \nFirst-round opponent: vs. No. 27 Bolingbrook (5-4) \nThe resume: The Redhawks rolled to their first outright DuPage Valley Conference since 2001 and scored a big Upstate Eight crossover win over Batavia -- the Bulldogs' only loss. With quarterback Conor Joyce and Iowa-bound receiver Emmanuel Rugamba, they have one of the top offenses in 8A. Naperville Central, which won the 8A title the last time the finals were held in DeKalb in 2013, is again among the 8A favorites. The Redhawks boast 10 wins in their last three playoff appearances. \nThe draw: Bolingbrook sneaked into the playoffs with a Friday win. The bad news for the Redhawks, though, is that win came against previously unbeaten and top-ranked Homewood-Flossmoor. If the Redhawks get by this game, the bracket looks favorable. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 22 Warren (5-4) at No. 11 Curie (8-1) winner. \nDuPage County's Class 7A qualifiers \nNo. 12 Benet (7-2) \nFirst-round opponent: vs. No. 21 St. Charles North (7-2) \nThe resume: After two straight 6-3 regular seasons, Benet earned its fourth straight playoff berth with an extra win in its pocket. The Redwings grinded through a brutal East Suburban Catholic schedule, so nothing will intimidate. Benet came into the year prepared to ride its defensive strength with linebackers Charlie Weidenbach and Jeff Marek, lineman Trent Kramer and safety Alec McEachern. The development of quarterback Jack Sznajder and running back Marty Dosen, however, also created a pretty potent offense. \nThe draw: Same records but different paths. While Benet went 4-2 against qualifiers, the North Stars went 2-2 and didn't face a team with a winning record the last four weeks. Batavia/Cary-Grove/ Simeon among the other contenders in this corner of the bracket. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 28 Belleville West (5-4) at No. 5 Cary-Grove (8-1) winner. \nNo. 30 Downers Grove North (5-4) \nFirst-round opponent: vs. No. 3 Libertyville (9-0) \nThe resume: The Trojans endured numerous key offensive injuries, including to quarterback Brandon Bancoro and running back Connor Olson, while navigating a brutal stretch against Hinsdale Central, Glenbard West, Oak Park and Lyons Twp. They recovered just in time to notch three straight victories with their run-heavy offense finally healthy. Don't let the low seed fool you. In its last three appearances Downers North upset higher-seeded Wheaton Warrenville South, Batavia and Whitney Young in the first round. \nThe draw: This isn't the first-round matchup the Trojans wanted, not with talented Libertyville quarterback Riley Lees awaiting in a hostile environment. Again, though, this is nothing new. They're battle-tested and accustomed to beating higher seeds. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 19 Jacobs (7-2) at No. 14 Lincoln-Way East (7-2) winner. \nNo. 1 Glenbard West (9-0) \nFirst-round opponent: vs. No. 32 Moline (5-4) \nThe resume: The Hilltoppers enter the postseason unbeaten for the sixth time in eight years after claiming an eighth straight West Suburban Silver title. It won't be easy but Glenbard West has the potential to win its third state title and first since 2012. As always the Hilltoppers lean on their ground game with Vanderbilt-bound Sam Brodner and Isaiah Skinner, but don't underestimate the play of quarterback Brian Cochrane. Linebackers Nico Gagliano and Ross Andreasik are as good as they come. \nThe draw: Being the top seed in 7A brought no advantages, not with Glenbard North or Mt. Carmel coming up in the second round. If the Hilltoppers survive the second round, the path looks real good. They'd be at home if Mt. Carmel beats Glenbard North. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 17 Glenbard North (7-2) at No. 16 Mt. Carmel (7-2) winner. \nNo. 17 Glenbard North (7-2) \nFirst-round opponent: at No. 16 Mt. Carmel (7-2) \nThe resume: The DuPage Valley Conference's top offense with 277 points has scored less than 28 only once during a seven-game win streak. Also just 2 points off Naperville Central's league-best 94 points allowed, a secondary including Justin Pitts, Devion Hodges, Greg Newsome, Tyrik Henderson and Jace James has 17 interceptions. Of possible concern to the Panthers, back in the playoffs after an 11-year skein was snapped in 2014, is a Week 8 injury to Vittorio Tricase, who joins Hodges each over 1,000 yards rushing. \nThe draw: No worries, just the legendary 12-time state champion Caravan, which beat Glenbard North in the 2012 8A title game as well as in a 2007 semifinal. It's a shame one of them is a first-round loser -- and the winner must go on to play Glenbard West. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 32 Moline (5-4) at No. 1 Glenbard West (9-0) winner. \nDuPage County's Class 6A qualifiers \nNo. 13 Hinsdale South (6-3) \nFirst-round opponent: vs. No. 4 Thornton (8-1) \nThe resume: On the heels of last season's run to the 6A quarterfinals, the Hornets are prepared for another long playoff stay. Like last year, Hinsdale South is loaded on offense with quarterback Sean McCormack, running back Marcus Curry and receivers Ravon Johnson, Connor McCormack and two-way standout Robert Hall. The Hornets thrive in 6A because they've spent nine games facing 7A and 8A competition. It may cost them a loss or two in the regular season, but it prepares them for this time of year. \nThe draw: With Thornton averaging 34 points, you'd better get ready for some offense in this one. Only one 5-4 team resides on this half of the 6A bracket, but that won't concern Hinsdale South. Unbeaten Lincoln-Way North anchors the south at the top seed. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 12 Quincy (6-3) at No. 5 Oak Forest (8-1) winner. \nNo. 1 Montini (9-0) \nFirst-round opponent: vs. No. 16 Wauconda (5-4) \nThe resume: Six straight championship games, 5A titles from 2009-2012, a fifth title in 2004 and 23 straight playoff appearances. Ranked behind only title-game nemesis Sacred Heart-Griffin all season in 6A, where the IHSA bumped both teams this season due to the new \"success adjustment\" rule. Class 5A or 6A, Broncos coach Chris Andriano expects a deep playoff run if not a title bid, ingrained in such defensive players as Luke Stone, Jake Kapp and Mitch West, who helped record 4 shutouts and allow 53 points. \nThe draw: Wauconda brings a 3-6 playoff record over six appearances. Montini is 3-0 in the playoffs against Kaneland. DeKalb is a potential quarterfinal foe for Montini with Riverside-Brookfield and Prairie Ridge, a pair of 8-1 teams, each vying for semifinal berths. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 9 Belvidere North (6-3) at No. 8 Kaneland (6-3) winner. \nDuPage County's Class 5A qualifiers \nNo. 16 Glenbard South (5-4) \nFirst-round opponent: at No. 1 Westinghouse (8-1) \nThe resume: The Raiders' fifth straight playoff appearance is the first for rookie coach and Glenbard West graduate Ryan Crissey. Glenbard South lacks momentum after losing its last two games. On Friday all-Metro Suburban West quarterback Kyle Carli reinjured a collarbone broken in Week 1. Thus, the Raiders will trust what they've done all fall, run the ball with Sean Cooke and sophomore quarterback Jack Crouch. Glenbard South has advanced into the second round six of the last eight seasons. \nThe draw: In 2012 and 2014 Westinghouse went 7-2 and hosted, part of its 0-5 playoff record. This draw may favor the deceivingly 16th-seeded Raiders. Tinley Park scored a ton but had 35 playoff points. Potential quarterfinalist St. Laurence averaged 49 points. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 9 Payton (7-2) at No. 8 Tinley Park (7-2) winner. \nDuPage County's Class 4A qualifiers \nNo. 13 Wheaton Academy (6-3) \nFirst-round opponent: at No. 4 Geneseo (8-1) \nThe resume: Boasting a 6-win regular season for the first time since 1980, the Warriors make their second playoff appearance. The first came in 2009 when as a No. 16 seed they stunned No. 1 Hillcrest 20-19. Wheaton Academy went 0-3 against the Metro Suburban West's toughies but was otherwise spotless. Third-year starting quarterback David Thrasher, running back-linebacker Chase Martin and fellow two-way players Steven Sellers and Harrison Taylor paced an offense that averaged 30 points a game. \nThe draw: Like his father, Geneseo coach Larry Johnsen Jr. has enjoyed success. No titles yet but two runner-up finishes and two semifinals, including last year's 52-15 loss to Montini. The Maple Leafs allowed 63 points. Their 39th appearance ties Joliet Catholic. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 12 Herscher (6-3) at No. 5 Manteno (8-1) winner. \nDuPage County's Class 3A qualifiers \nNo. 3 IC Catholic Prep (8-1) \nFirst-round opponent: vs. No. 14 Winnebago (5-4) \nThe resume: Back in the postseason for the first time since 2012, the Knights may be a team foes won't want to face. Seven of IC's victories -- and its sole loss to Bishop McNamara in Week 1 -- came against larger schools. IC took a similar path to the 2002 3A championship as well as its 2008 2A title. The Metro Suburban West champs outscored foes by an average of 23 points behind athletes like quarterback Luke Ricobene, Jordan Rowell, Jim Kenneally, Patrick Jordan and freshman nose tackle Kemon Reese. \nThe draw: Winnebago ousted IC 30-29 in the first round in 2011, the first of three straight 3A quarterfinal seasons. Potential second-round foe Elmwood-Brimfield averaged 43.6 points. If IC reaches a semifinal the team that beat them, Bishop McNamara, may await. \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 11 DePaul (6-3) at No. 6 Elmwood-Brimfield (8-1) winner. \nNo. 9 Lisle (7-2) \nFirst-round opponent: at No. 8 Byron (7-2) \nThe resume: Hall of Fame coach Paul Parpet Sr., in his second season at Lisle after taking Addison Trail to the playoffs 11 times, engineered a turnaround from a 1-8 season to the Lions' first postseason appearance since 2008. Lisle finished with six straight wins, including its last two over Interstate Eight Large foes Coal City and Plano, holding each under 200 yards of offense. Since quarterback Alec Van Volkenburg's season-ending knee injury, junior Mark McGrath has effectively driven this old-school offense. \nThe draw: A No. 7 seed last season at 5-4, Byron was bounced by defending 3A champion Wilmington in the semifinals. Speaking of Wilmington, it lurks in a probable second-round matchup. That was Lisle's last loss, in Week 3, a close 21-7 Parpet called \"a big step.\" \nAdvancement: Winner plays the No. 16 Peoria Heights (5-4) at No. 1 Wilmington (9-0) winner.
