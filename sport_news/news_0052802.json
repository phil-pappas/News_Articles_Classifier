We all have to be better all around. We weren’t even close.”\nIt wasn’t a pretty return to regular-season action for Giordano from that season-ending torn biceps tendon injury suffered last February.\nSure it was an ugly night for everybody donning a Flaming C, but the leader of the ship is always going to be under extra scrutiny.\nGiordano’s official stat line includes a couple of shots on goal, one attempt blocked, a couple of takeaways and two blocked shots, all while paired with newcomer Dougie Hamilton.\n“They were OK, nothing great, but it’s pretty tough to find a player with a positive rating on our team,” head coach Bob Hartley said of the defencemen duo.\n“As much as we want to be positive, we have to be honest. I’m not going to tell our fans that we’re happy about our game. We have responsibilities to win, we have responsibilities toward ownership, towards fans, to put on a good show, to put on a good product and (Wednesday) night is simply not acceptable.”\nIt wouldn’t be fair to expect Giordano and Hamilton would have their rapport down pat already — certainly not to the level Giordano and the currently injured TJ Brodie had last season — but the Calgary captain insists he and Hamilton are getting on the same page.\n“It feels good. He’s a great skater and easy guy to play with, moves the puck well and jumps into the play a lot,” Giordano said. “If you look at the stat sheets at the end of the night, sometimes it’s not pretty but it doesn’t tell the whole story. Last game was a bad game by our entire team, but we’ll regroup and play better Saturday.”\n“I honestly thought we were fine at the start of the game, making plays,” he added. “Dougie had a few good looks jumping in, but we were defending a lot the rest of the night, and whenever you’re defending, nothing good is gonna come of it.”\nThat said, nobody is worried about Giordano getting his game in ship-shape. After all, we are talking about a player who was a front-runner for the Norris Trophy as the league’s top defenceman before that injury cost him the final quarter of the campaign.\nIt’s just a matter of time before his game is in top gear.\n“As much as Gio’s a great worker and we played him in three, four exhibition games, we all know that exhibition games are not NHL games,” Hartley said. “When you’re forced to play against the Sedins, it’s top NHL. It doesn’t get much better than this. They were OK and we’re going to challenge everybody to be better.”\nWhich happens to be Giordano’s bigger focus.\n“It sucks to lose but it’s almost a wakeup call,” he said of Wednesday’s outing. “We didn’t play our style and that’s the result.”\nrandy.sportak@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/SUNRandySportak\nFlames\nCapt.
