I always have been. I am also a very, very huge Joey Logano fan. I always have been. I've watched Joey literally grow up. He and my son Brandon used to race Bandolero cars against each other when Joey was six or seven years old. \nSetting all of that aside, I absolutely do not see anything wrong that went on there at the end of the race Sunday at Kansas. Naturally, Matt doesn't see it that way and trust me, I totally get it. The man was desperate to get the win to guarantee that he and his team moved onto the next round of the Chase. \nI feel Matt did everything he should have done to try to win that race. At the same time, I think Joey Logano did everything he should have done to protect his turf. The reality is that it was five laps to go. It was two drivers trying to win a race and our sport has been missing situations like we saw Sunday. \nLet me put it another way, what do you think Dale Earnhardt Sr. would have done to Matt Kenseth with five laps to go? What do you think Rusty Wallace would have done? What do you think David Pearson, Darrell Waltrip or Cale Yarborough would have done? \nI know what they would have done. I've seen them do it. We simply haven't seen a lot of this in our sport lately. Believe me, I hate it for Matt because now he basically has to win at Talladega on Sunday or his Chase dreams are over. I'm just being honest here, this is what has been missing from our sport and I was excited to see it. \nLet's face it, the racing has not been good lately. I'd be lying to you and myself if I tried to tell you otherwise. So I didn't see anything wrong with what I saw happen between Matt and Joey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:04:11.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
