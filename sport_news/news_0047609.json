Now, there is no room for error. What do you think? Log in and start commenting \nQuite how Jackett addresses the problem remains to be seen. While hinting he will only move in the transfer market should anything befall the current first-choice pairing of Batth and Kortney Hause, he must surely be tempted to bring another body on board for what will be a hectic spell of six games in the space of three weeks before the next international break. \nThat would avoid moving too many pieces of a back four he believes has begun to find its balance in recent weeks, symbolised by the back-to-back clean sheets. \nDominic Iorfa, at right-back, has been a key component and while the 20-year-old is a definite option as centre-back cover, having played there as a youngster, he is one Jackett is loathed to use. Dominic Iorfa steps out for England training (picture courtesy of @england) \n“Dominic is someone who could play centre-back but it would be my preference to keep him on the right and keep him developing there,” explained Jackett. “For young players, if they move positions too many times I don’t think it particularly helps them. \n“If you move too many times I don’t think you ever really settle down and learn one position. Dominic is in that area. \n“I personally feel when Dominic and Kortney are at full-back, though, the presence of our back four is very good, I can tell both are learning those positions. \n“It does not quite look right. In recent games, with Iorfa playing right-back and Kortney playing left centre-back, we look better balanced.” \nCentral defence is not Jackett’s only concern – with a lack of like-for-like cover at left-back behind Scott Golbourne. Should the latter suffer any misfortune, Matt Doherty and Sylvain Deslandes remain the likely replacements with the head coach reluctant to move Hause from a central position. \n“The season throws these things up and as a club and as a team we have to cope,” said Jackett of Ebanks-Landell’s injury. \nNo argument there though, without any move in the loan market, the head coach knows for the next few weeks he is will be treading a defensive tightrope.
