Mired in an early-season slump, many wrote off this year's Texas Rangers team as another disappointing extension of the 2014 season. The water-cooler talks, if anyone was talking at all, centered around the future. How long would it take to get Joey Gallo and Nomar Mazara and Jorge Alfaro up to the big league club? How could we shed the contracts of Elvis Andrus and Prince Fielder and Shin-Soo Choo? \nWhose uniform would Adrian Beltre be wearing when the 2015 season came to a close? It could have gone that way. Adrian Beltre's season could have ended one night later as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers (or would it have ended?); the team that brought him to the big leagues. #NeverEverQuit could have been a punchline by mid-summer as we watched the last vestiges of a winning team dismantled and re-tooled for a run in 2017 or beyond. We could have seen the Rangers eliminated by September first, and maybe it would have been the Angels getting their hearts ripped out by Toronto in Game Five (So it wouldn't be *all* bad). \nInstead, if you were paying attention, you saw much more compelling things: \nYou got to see Adrian Beltre battle father time and win again; walking into the manager's office and proclaiming himself ready to play, despite a badly-injured thumb that had kept him out of action for weeks. The thumb wasn't healed, but he had figured out a way to swing the bat that mitigated the pain enough, and he wanted to play. He was activated immediately, started that night, and another injured finger later, won AL player of the week for the last week of the season. So when Beltre again proclaimed himself ready to play before Game 4 of the ALDS, it shocked the people who didn't know Adrian Beltre. We smiled and nodded. \nYou got to see Keone Kela make his big league debut against the Oakland Athletics nine days before his twenty-second birthday, and load the bases before inducing an inning-ending double play. He never looked rattled at all. So when the likely AL MVP, flanked by the Human Embodiment of a Knit-Beard Hat both began to bark at him in Game Two, some might have expected the rookie to be shaken. Nah. We watched Kela take off his glove and calmly walk towards the aggressors. When asked later about how he responds to being challenged, he replied \"I am the challenger\". \nYou got to see Rougned Odor struggle early and spend some time in AAA. I wonder how many of the people in the TV booth for these five games could tell you the name Tommy Field? That's no knock on them; they have 29 other teams to keep up with. But when Rougie made his triumphant return as a force to be reckoned with, you knew it wasn't just a good player putting up good numbers. That was a gamer who had worked incredibly hard to come back, and was seeing the fruits of his labor. \nYou watched Wandy Rodriguez finish fourth on the team in innings pitched, and set a franchise record for most consecutive batters retired. You saw innings from Logan Verrett. You recognize the irony that while neither of those two are currently on the active rosters of the Royals or Mets, respectively, both of those guys now play for franchises who are still in the playoffs. \nYou know the stories of the cast-offs; Josh Hamilton the most notable, but also Delino DeShields, who was left unprotected by the Astros last off-season, allowing the Rangers to make him a Rule 5 draft pick. Shawn Tolleson was a waiver claim from the Dodgers. Ross Ohlendorf was all but left for dead. Each of them played significant parts in this unlikely run of success. Nick Martinez, Staff Ace was a very real thing in April and May. \nAnd while the national narrative on Sam Dyson is going to be that of the grumpy choke artist, you've seen his portfolio and know better. You watched him throw that bowling ball sinker and get ground ball out after ground ball out. The result of that fateful at-bat was apocalyptic, but if my team faces Bautista in that situation again, give me Dyson ten times out of ten. \nYou saw Hanser Alberto play great defense in his time on the big league club. When the broadcasters started saying \"The ball will find you\", you hoped it would, so he could show them why he was the minor league defensive player of the year last year. \"He's better than they're giving him credit for\", you might have muttered. And he was. He is. \nThis team was a huge underdog in the ALDS against a juggernaut of a Blue Jays team. No one expected the Rangers to win. If they had been swept, we would have collectively shrugged it off and been happy for the overachievement. But it hurts a little more that they almost pulled it off. It hurts a lot more when the collapse was most visibly fueled by Elvis Andrus and Derek Holland; two of the longest-tenured and likable guys on the team. But you know how Elvis and Dutch have been a part of every community event, every fundraiser, every opportunity to engage and give back to the community. I don't know; maybe that knowledge makes it even worse than worse. \nThe 2015 Rangers will be remembered by some as another postseason meltdown, sent up in flames by E6, E3, E6, Bat-Flip. And if that's all you saw this year, well - congrats: you caught the most sensational part. \nBut for the rest of us, given some time to process the awful ending, this team will and should be remembered as one of the best underdog stories in recent years. It was fun to have playoff baseball again, especially having been given a year to see what it's like to be awful. Sure, there are questions about whether Mitch Moreland or Prince Fielder or Shin-Soo Choo or Elvis Andrus will be back next year. But It's going to be fun to watch the team next year with a rotation anchored by Cole Hamels and Yu Darvish. It will be worth the investment to watch players like Odor, Kela, Gallo, and DeShields grow and mature over the next few years; to see them joined by new names like Nomar Mazara, Lewis Brinson, and eventually Connor Sadzeck, Jose LeClerc, Jairo Beras, and others (and if I may indulge a personal hope: Yoenis Cespedes?) There are a thousand more stories to come for this team. \nDon't miss them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:27:51.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
