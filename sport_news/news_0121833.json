Down nine points to Londonderry, the Clippers got a stop when a fake field-goal try was misplayed. Then quarterback Cody Graham drove them 73 yards in 10 plays and cashed in, hitting Christian Peete for a 24-yard touchdown and then Joey Glynn in the back of the end zone for the two-point conversion that pulled them within 21-20. Game on. \"The third quarter was a great quarter for us,\" said Portsmouth coach Brian Pafford. \"We played very well. We hung in there.\" On a chilly, rainy night at Lancer Park, the Clippers hung in and ultimately took away some positives. But it was the Lancers (2-3) making enough plays in the fourth quarter to take away a 30-20 win – and the knowledge that their Division I playoff hopes are still intact. At 1-4, it’s tough to say the same for Portsmouth. \"We saw something in the paper that said whoever wins, (the other team) misses the playoffs,\" said wide receiver/safety Shon Parham. \"We really tried to come out and give it all. We just fell short at the end.\" In a game that saw the teams combine for eight turnovers, the Clippers coughed up five of them, in addition to a Glynn punt that got blocked late in the first quarter and set up the Lancers with a short field; three plays later David Wiedenfield scored the first of his three rushing touchdowns and his team went up 7-6. The Clippers had an answer, with Jake Lorenz catching a screen pass on the right side and knifing through defenders for a 63-yard score to make it 12-7. But two other golden chances to find the end failed. First, down 21-12 after a fumble gave the Lancers another short field, the Clippers drove from their own 20 to the 4 in 12 plays, setting up a first-and-goal. But runs by Joey Auger (16 carries, 61 yards) gained 2, 1 and 0 yards, and a fourth-down pass was batted away at the line by Jimmy Nee. Right before the half, instead of running out the remaining seconds, Graham (15-of-28, 220 yards, 3 TDs, 3 INTs) connected with Ryan Edney down the left sideline and Edney, while juggling the ball, made a tackler miss and had an open field ahead. But he couldn’t hang on, the play was ruled a fumble and the Lancers recovered at the 15, their nine-point lead intact. \"We went over there thinking we should have been up at half,\" said Pafford, of the halftime meeting. \"We could have laid down and said things aren’t going our way. We didn’t. We came back.\" \"I thought they should have had 19 (points) but I thought we should have had 42,\" said Londonderry coach Jimmy Lauzon, who watched his team fumble the ball away at the goal line in the second quarter. \"Sometimes we’re our own worst enemy.\" Quarterback Jake Stevens, who won the starting job after a month-long competition, carried the ball 21 times for 121 yards. He also passed effectively, hitting on 13-of-21 for 230 yards, a figure that included some big conversions on third-and-longs and seven connections (for 112 yards) to Wiedenfeld. The Lancers finished with a 520-361 edge in total yardage. Down just 21-20 after Graham’s third touchdown pass with 2:48 left in the third quarter, the Clippers needed a stop and couldn’t get it. Stevens led a 13-play, 65-yard drive that included conversions on a third-and-11 and later a fourth-and-6, a 16-yard pass to Wiedenfeld that moved the ball to the 10; two plays later it was 27-20. \"They give you fits,\" said Pafford. \"We tried to take away one thing and they get you with the other stuff.\" Portsmouth’s next two drives ended with a punt and an interception. With the defense allowing just nine points after halftime, the offense didn’t quite have the fuel to take advantage. Peete led the way with six catches for 76 yards on the score. Graham was off-target throwing the deeper passes on a bad-weather night, but still impressed, also running for 71 yards on 11 carries. \"I told him after the game, he has a bright future ahead of him,\" said Lauzon. \"They put a lot on him as a sophomore and he handles it. They should be excited, to have a guy like that for three years.\" The immediate future for the Clippers is a game next week against unbeaten Exeter, where they know they’ll have to be cleaner and probably even tougher. \"I liked our guys’ effort tonight,\" said Parham. \"There were some bright spots (tonight),\" said Pafford. \"We’re playing to the end. We’re running to the ball. We’re doing it better.\" Portsmouth 12 0 8 0 20 Londonderry 7 14 0 9 30 First Quarter Por-Parham 4 pass from Graham (Adams kick), 6:25 Lon-Wiedenfeld 5 run (Donnelly kick), 3:42 Por-Lorenz 63 pass from Graham (pass failed), 3:21 Second Quarter Lon-Wiedenfeld 1 run (Donnelly kick), 11:13 Lon-Navarro 13 run (Donnelly kick), 10:12 Third Quarter Por-Peete 24 pass from Graham (Glynn pass from Graham), 2:48 Fourth Quarter Lon-Wiedenfeld 1 run (kick failed), 9:38 Lon-Donnelly 31 FG, 4:29 INDIVIDUAL STATS RUSHING: Por: Auger 16-61, Graham 11-71, Parham 2-12; Lon: Stevens 21-121, Wiedenfeld 15-46, Zimolka 3-35, Doran 7-31, Navarro 4-49, Donnelly 1-(-3), Proulx 3-11 PASSING: Por: Graham 15-28-220 (3 TDs, 3 INTs); Lon: Stevens 13-21-230 (INT) RECEIVING: Por: Lorenz 3-77, Edney 2-43, Peete 6-76, Parham 4-29; Lon: Wiedenfeld 7-112, Meskell 1-9, Donnelly 2-30, McDonald 1-17, Navarro 1-36, Doran 1-26", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:07:22.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
