I am really encouraged by what I have seen thus far.” \nThe Penguins began pre-season drills this past Saturday and will open their season at Mid-American Conference foe Kent State in the annual “Coaches vs. Cancer” contest, a designated game rotated between Northeastern Ohio foes YSU, Kent State University, Cleveland State University and the University of Akron. \nAlso on the schedule are road games at Big Ten foes Michigan and Purdue, and Notre Dame of the Atlantic Coast Conference. \n“The ‘Coaches vs. Cancer’ game is always a special game and next year, we are all set to host that game when we open our season against the University of Akron in early November,” Slocum added. \nForward Bobby Hain is one of the players Slocum will be counting on this season. \n“Bobby is a top-tier player in our league, someone who can shoot inside and post-up as well. He’s a walking double-double,” he added. \nSlocum said despite their youth, the conglomeration of talent that he has assembled is special. \nFrancisco Santiago and Latin Davis are the team’s point guards while Cameron Morse and Brett Frantz are the off-guards. \nJordan Andrews and Matt Donlan are the forwards while Hain is joined by Bryce Nickels and Devin Haygood at the #4 slot. \nThe middle is manned by Sidney Umude and Jordan Kaufman with former Ursuline High School star Ryan Strollo and Tyler Warford, both guards, rounding out the squad. \n“Our strength is our inside game and we’re counting on both Umude and Kaufman in the middle. Sidney is perhaps the most improved player that I have seen going from his freshmen to sophomore seasons,” Slocum noted. “Sanitago, Frantz and Donlan can flat out shoot and that was one of our weaknesses a season ago. Andrews can shoot and elevate, is extremely athletic and someone I consider a ‘Freshman of the Year’ candidate in our league,’ he added. “Tyler Warford brings a lot to the table as well while Ryan Strollo is someone who can shoot the ball with anyone.” \nThe Penguins’ fourth annual Basketball Tip-Off Banquet is scheduled for Oct. 25 at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Social Hall in Youngstown. \nIndividual tickets are $35 with a table of eight going for $280. \nFans can sponsor a player for $20 and further information can be obtained by calling 330-941-3712. \nDoors open at 4 p.m., a buffet dinner will be scheduled for 4:45 p.m. with the program set to begin at 5:30 p.m. \nNext week, YSU women’s basketball coach John Barnes will serve as guest speaker.
