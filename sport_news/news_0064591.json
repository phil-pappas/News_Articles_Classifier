But the Spaniard, whose Repsol Honda had been fastest in all four practice and qualifying sessions leading into the Grand Prix, produced a track record 1 minute, 29.280 second final lap to charge into the lead. \nLorenzo held on for second, 0.7 seconds ahead of Ducati rider Iannone who produced the best race of his short career to keep Rossi off the podium. Rossi's overall championship lead was cut to 11 points with two races remaining, at Sepang, Malaysia next weekend and at Valencia, Spain on Nov. 8. \nMarquez is a further 63 points behind Lorenzo in third place and may surrender his world title, though he was delighted to celebrate his first win in Australia. \n\"During the race I felt well but at the beginning there were many overtakes between me, Valentino, Andrea and Jorge who opened some gaps,\" Marquez said. \"Then I pushed a little bit to catch Jorge and it looks like I overheated the front tire. \n\"I had a lot of movement when I tried to open a gap and I tried to cool down but it was not there. In the last lap I said 'okay, I will push'. \n\"Andrea did overtake me and then on the last lap I pushed 100 percent. I didn't expect to overtake Jorge but I'm really happy with this victory because we've pushed really hard and the races are not coming but this victory is really nice for us.\" \nLorenzo was struck by a seagull during the race but continued to push hard for the win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:42:32.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
