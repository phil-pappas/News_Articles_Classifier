Oscar Morfin got the Pirates on the board with a 2-yard run, Havin Heytvelt ran in the 2-point conversion and Pomeroy was off. Pirates quarterback Heytvelt scrambled for a 26-yard score, and followed that up with a 1-yard touchdown as Pomeroy opened up the 20-0 lead. “In the first quarter, we controlled the game offensively and defensively,” Pirates coach Sanford Bates said. In the second quarter, Cameron Springstead scored on runs of 6 and 10 yards as Gar-Pal pulled within 20-12, but Heytvelt hit Aiden Dixon on a 22-yard scoring completion to take a 26-12 lead into halftime. Heytvelt took it in from 11 yards out for the lone third-quarter score, and Ian Niebergs took the kickoff 75 yards for Gar-Pal’s final score. Cade Gingerich finished off Pomeroy’s scoring with a 7-yard scamper. “They (the Vikings were able to get a couple touchdowns in the second quarter, and after that we pretty much shut them down,” Bates said. “Besides the kickoff return, defensively we were able to keep them under wraps the rest of the game.” Heytvelt completed 9-of-17 throws for 226 yards and no interceptions for the Pirates. “He’s improving every game,” Bates said of his QB. “He’s getting more command in running the game and making good decisions. I look forward to that continuing the last two games.” Pomeroy also racked up 288 yards on the ground on 44 carries, with Gingerich gaining 165 yards on 27 carries. “It’s always nice to share the wealth, and have several people involved,” Bates said of the balanced offense. “Their defense can’t key on one person.” Bates also applauded the Pirates defense. “In the fourth quarter, it came down to them throwing the ball,” he said. “Our secondary stepped up and made good plays on some well-thrown balls. They (Gar-Pal) had one completion the entire game. That’s a big plus for our secondary.” Pomeroy is now 3-2 in SE1B-8 play, 3-4 overall, as the Pirates head to Colton on Friday. “They’ll put the ball in the air most of the time,” Bates said of the Wildcats. “But we have to make sure we don’t go to sleep on the run, as well, but they like to put the ball in the air.” Pomeroy 42, Gar-Pal 20 Gar-Pal 0 12 0 8 — 20 Pomeroy 20 6 8 8 — 42 Pom — Morfin 2 run (Heytvelt run).
