The information they help gather will be used as part of South Carolina’s request for federal disaster assistance. South Carolina made the request for personnel through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact or EMAC.\n\"Louisiana and GOHSEP stand ready to help our friends in other states when they face this type of disaster,\" said GOHSEP Executive Director Kevin Davis. \"Our employees have the knowledge and experience other states often look for when they need support. We have been fortunate to avoid any recent events in Louisiana. We are proud to be able to help meet this request after South Carolina’s historic flooding.\"\nEMAC offers assistance during governor-declared states of emergency through a responsive, straightforward system that allows states to send personnel, equipment, and commodities to help disaster relief efforts in other states. Through EMAC, states are able to join forces and help one another, as needed, during each phase of the emergency. The state to state system was developed after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and established in 1996.\nFor more information on the Emergency Management Assistance Compact visit www.emacweb.org .\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
