Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 5:57 PM Updated at 6:01 PM Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 5:57 PM Updated at 6:01 PM 5 POSITIVES 1. Hurricane hunters: Florida State beat rival Miami for the sixth straight time Saturday , the longest streak in the series since the Seminoles won seven straight from 1963-72. This victory, a come-from-behind 29-26 effort, came in familiar fashion with RB Dalvin Cook scoring the go-ahead TD for the second straight year. 2. No more ‘Clemsoning’: Tigers’ coach Dabo Swinney went into a postgame rant when asked about the now outdated term. And for good reason. Saturday’s 43-24 win against Georgia Tech, in which Clemson emphatically avoided a post-Notre Dame letdown, was the Tigers’ 33rd straight against unranked opponents. It was also their 13th straight home win, tying a school record. 3. Stealth Panthers: Pittsburgh has been flying under the radar, especially since losing star RB James Conner to a season-ending injury on opening day. But led by Tennessee transfer Nate Peterman at QB and a rejuvenated defense, coach Pat Narduzzi’s Panthers are quietly off to a 4-1 start (2-0 ACC) after a 26-19 win against Virginia. The 700th win in school history gave Pitt its best start since 2009. 4. Outflanking the Army: Duke’s nationally ranked defense limited Army to 168 total yards in a 44-3 rout of the Cadets. Even more significant is the performance of an offense that has struggled the past three weeks. QB Thomas Sirk threw for 197 yards and his first TD since Sept. 12 and backup Parker Boehm ran for two scores to lead the Blue Devils to their first consecutive 5-1 starts since 1952-53. 5. Built Ford tough: Sophomore WR Isaiah Ford caught three TDs in the second quarter Friday night to lead Virginia Tech from a 10-0 deficit to a 28-13 win against N.C. State. It was the first time coach Frank Beamer’s 29 seasons that a Hokies receiver scored three times in a single period and helped improve to 4-0 in regular-season games played on Fridays. 5 NEGATIVES 1. C omedy of errors: Wake Forest beat Boston College 3-0, but neither team acted as if it wanted to win in the final two minutes. First the Eagles lost a fumble while driving for the tying or winning score. Then with the game seemingly saved, the Deacons gave the turnover right back with a fumble of their own at the 11-yard line. BC then made the final mistake with some horrendous clock management that allowed the game to end with the ball at the 1-yard line. 2. Dirty dozen: Virginia’s loss at Pittsburgh was its 12th straight on the road dating back to a 33-6 at N.C. State back in 2012. The Cavaliers did force their first turnover of the season, a fumble recovered for a TD by Kwontie Moore, but it wasn’t enough to avoid their ninth loss in their last 10 games against FBS opponents and further seal coach Mike London’s fate. 3. Ground to a halt: Every time it looks as if Georgia Tech has hit rock bottom, it sinks even lower. The Yellow Jackets’ loss at Clemson wasn’t just their fourth straight -- their longest losing streak since 1996 -- but their 71 rushing yards were their fewest since behind held to 79 against Gardner-Webb in 2008. Tech came into the game averaging 311 rushing yards per game. 4. Wolfpack’s woeful quarter: The Wolfpack started the second quarter at Virginia Tech on Friday with a TD that extended its lead to 10-0, but then did itself in with of the worst 14-minute stretches imaginable. Coach Dave Doeren’s was outgained 156-2 and gave up three unanswered TDs to allow the Hokies to rally for a victory that ended State’s streak of five straight wins away from home. 5. Bulled over: Syracuse’s 3-0 start is not just a distant memory after Saturday’s 45-24 drubbing at the hands of South Florida. The Orange came into the game ranked 17th nationally in rushing defense, but allowed the Bulls to run for 282 yards and 531 overall to lose for the second straight game. ACC have now lost three times this season to teams from the American Athletic Conference. Page 2 of 2 - DEVELOPMENT OF THE WEEK It’s still early in the conference schedule, but already the process of elimination has begun in both divisions. In the Coastal, defending champion and preseason favorite Georgia Tech officially played its way into also-ran status by falling to 0-3 in the ACC. On the other side of the ledger, N.C State and BC both ended any hopes they had of contending in the Atlantic with their second league losses. PLAYER OF THE WEEK Dalvin Cook’s status for Saturday’s game against Miami was uncertain after the Florida State star left last week’s win at Wake Forest with a hamstring injury. But Cook not only played against the rival Hurricanes, he dominated them by rushing for 222 yards and three TDs -- including a 72-yarder on his first carry -- to lead the Seminoles to a come-from-behind victory. STAT OF THE WEEK Boston College’s 3-0 loss to Wake Forest, coupled with the Eagles 9-7 defeat at Duke the previous week marked only the second time in ACC history that a team has held two straight opponents without a TD and lost both games. The only other team to do it was, coincidentally, Wake Forest all the way back in 1956. Those Deacons lost at home to Maryland 6-0 on Sept. 29, then dropped a 7-6 decision at Virginia on Oct. 6. Ironically, BC is also the most recent team to lose two straight when not allowing a TD. The Eagles also had it happen to them in 1989. QUOTE OF THE WEEK “We had to get a conference win to stay in it. … Some wins are bigger than others and this one was big and critical.” Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer after Friday’s win against N.C. State LOOKING AHEAD North Carolina returns from its bye to take on Wake Forest at Kenan Stadium while N.C. State and Duke have the week off to rest up and, in the case of the Wolfpack, figure out how to turn things around. Elsewhere around the ACC, Virginia Tech is at Miami in what is now a pivotal Coastal Division showdown while Clemson takes on Boston College and Florida State plays Louisville in hopes of staying on top in the Atlantic.
