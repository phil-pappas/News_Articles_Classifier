You’d have to nitpick to find statistical concerns in those games, but although Duke finds itself 2-1 in its last three games and off to a 2-0 start in ACC play, some potential causes for concern are becoming evident. \nOf course, it’s just as easy to call these causes for concern reasons for jubilation. Duke’s defense is as good as it’s been – both statistically and using the good old-fashioned eye test – in the Cutcliffe era. This was the last area of the roster to come around under Cutcliffe, because it takes time to get defensive talent in and develop it. Duke has it, and plenty of it. \nIn five games, Duke has allowed six touchdowns and has allowed opponents to reach the red zone five times. Duke has not allowed fewer than 5.0 yards per play in five straight games since CFBStats.com started tracking it until this year when Duke has done it in all five games. Since 2008 – 7 seasons before this one – Duke had allowed fewer than 4.0 yards a play eight times. The Blue Devils have already done it three times this season alone. \nLed by veterans like Dwayne Norman at linebacker and superstar senior Jeremy Cash at safety, the group has young talent to supplement its depth all over the field. Duke should feel really, really good about that defense. \nOh, and Duke is off to a 2-0 ACC start that has seen the preseason favorite Georgia Tech start 0-2 while Virginia Tech is 0-1 and Miami looked awful in a loss at Cincinnati. Just like we all predicted, the Coastal will run through Durham, Chapel Hill or Pittsburgh (both UNC and Pitt are 1-0) because early results mean everything. In all seriousness, Duke has done itself a lot of favors by getting off to a fast start. \nNow that we’ve gotten the good news out of the way … \nDuke’s offense, right now, is a problem. \nThe Blue Devils have a physical, experienced offensive line and a stable of backs to get the ball to – not to mention a quarterback in Thomas Sirk who can run for a few yards himself if need be. Duke knew it was going to have a tough time against a nasty, mean-tempered Boston College defensive front – and it did. Duke managed just 33 rushing yards, its lowest total since getting just 22 yards at Virginia Tech in a loss in 2012. \nThe loss of the running game isn’t even the biggest problem. Under Cutcliffe, especially in his earlier days as head coach, we’ve grown used to seeing his quarterbacks have to carry the load offensively, forced to win shootouts while a then-mediocre defense struggled against higher-caliber competition. The addition of a running game the last few years has been a luxury. \nThe defense is more than holding its own now, though. Through three games against Power 5 foes – two with excellent defensive fronts in Boston College and Northwestern, one with a so-so defense in Georgia Tech – Duke’s offense has been …. well, not good enough, frankly. After putting up 92 points in the first two games against subpar competition, the offense has managed just five touchdowns in the last three games. \nOn Saturday, Duke held Boston College to 100 total first-half yards. The Eagles, very limited at quarterback at the moment without Darius Wade, went 0-of-9 passing and ran for 100 yards. If there was a concern, it was a small one – that Duke let Boston College convert three of nine third downs. Not a bad percentage, but those three third downs were 60 percent of Boston College’s total first-half first downs (five). \nThe defense can’t do everything. Duke’s offense didn’t help a ton, going 2 of 7 on third down and holding an edge in time of possession of barely over a minute against an offense that didn’t complete a pass, and not for lack of trying. Boston College did all it could to keep the ball and milk the clock, minimizing the time its excellent defense would be stuck on the field. \nThe good news has been that Duke has gotten off to a fast start offensively in each of its last three games, averaging 5.1 yards per play in that stretch in the first half. Sirk has completed 63 percent of his passes and his yards-per-attempt is at 7.0 the last two weeks after it hovered around 4 against Northwestern. Duke has run for 4.1 first-half yards per carry – nothing to write home about, but solid and showing a commitment to the run even if it isn’t working. \nIn the second half of the last three games, though, Duke has surrendered or nearly surrendered leads as the offense has floundered, averaging just 2.9 yards per play (ew) and 2.9 per completion as well. Sirk’s completion percentage drops from 63 percent to 54.3 percent. Those numbers …. well, they’re good. The yards per carry drop from 4.1 to 3.0, but it hasn’t stopped Duke from committing to the run nearly equally in both halves. \nDuke got the win the last two weeks, and that’s all that matters. But Duke has 148 yards on 66 plays in the second half of the last two games (2.2 average). The biggest difference against Boston College is that Duke didn’t turn it over at all in either half compared to six turnovers in the previous two games. Duke has also forced six turnovers of its own in the last three games, five of which have come in the second half. Without those, though, do either of the last two games turn out differently? \nBoston College outgained Duke 205-73 in the second half, and while 99 of those BC yards came on two plays, Duke’s meh offensive second-half performances have given Duke’s defense no margin for error. \nIt’s not a lost cause by any stretch. I don’t know if anyone knew this, but David Cutcliffe can coach offense a little bit. And Sirk and the Duke passing attack found more downfield than they had against legit competition all season, either connecting with receivers or drawing pass interference calls. That was something noticeably lacking in other games, particularly against Northwestern. \nBut it still ended without an offensive touchdown and three Ross Martin field goals. Boston College’s defense is good, so that played a role, but Duke never wants to go without a touchdown. \n“A little bit of both,” Sirk said when asked if the outcome was the result of the Boston College defense or Duke’s offensive execution. “We should’ve scored. We had situations where we could’ve scored. … We had opportunities today to score but we just have to finish drives.” \nAs for the second-half production difference, Sirk doesn’t see anything tangible that changes from half to half, other than the standard defensive adjustments that every opponent is going to make. \n“I don’t think there’s any specific reason for that. I just think that we have to come out and execute in the second half just like we did in the first half and be consistent, because it’s going to take consistency the rest of the year,” Sirk said. \n“That’s something that we have to continue to get better at. We had chances today in the second half to score touchdowns, and we just have to take advantage of those chances. Their defense had a great stop on us several times. We just have to finish those drives.” \nDuke had three three-and-outs and the other three possessions that weren’t kneel-downs ended in Boston College territory, one at the BC 1-yard line after a four-down goal line stand for the BC defense. But two of the others ended across midfield and just sort of stalled. Duke gained a total of -2 yards on the eight plays run across the BC 45-yard line (Sirk was 1-of-6 passing for -2 yards). Maybe that was some of what Cutcliffe meant when he talked in the postgame about Sirk playing under “tough circumstances time and time again.\" \nCutcliffe wants more consistency out of both the offense and his quarterback, but he also acknowledged that Sirk has gone from role-player to full-time starter while a lot of the skill-position players who were staples of Duke’s offense are gone. It’s an adjustment for everyone. \n“We’re going to figure out the personality of this offense and that’s part of it,” Cutcliffe said. “We’re not the same people we were a year ago.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:24:17.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
