Photo by Doug Pensinger/Getty Images With the regular season drawing near, the Colorado Avalanche made a minor move Sunday night, announcing that they had traded forward Freddie Hamilton to the Calgary Flames in exchange for a conditional seventh-round selection in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft.\nWith the Flames organization, Hamilton will be reunited with his brother Dougie Hamilton , who was acquired by Calgary this summer in a trade with the Boston Bruins. The duo will not start the season on the same team however, as Freddie Hamilton will report to the AHL’s Stockton Thunder.\nThis move likely was addition by subtraction for the Avalanche, as it gives them some flexibility contract-wise going forward. The team now has 47 contracts in their system, and looks likely to sign either Jack Skille or Curtis Glencross (who are currently on professional tryout contracts with the team), or both. If they so choose, they will now be able to add both forwards without hitting their contract limit of 50.\nHamilton was acquired by the Avalanche from the San Jose Sharks at last season’s trade deadline in exchange for defenseman Karl Stollery. The 23-year-old played in 17 games for Colorado, scoring his first NHL goal. He also played in five games for the AHL’s Lake Erie Monsters, scoring four points. In 18 total NHL games last season, he had one point. In 57 AHL contests, he had 34 points.\nUpdate: The Avalanche announced on Monday that they have released Curtis Glencross from his PTO.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Avalanche/status/651108379188813824", "http://avalanche.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=781679&navid=DL|COL|home", "http://avalanche.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8475878"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:28:29.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
