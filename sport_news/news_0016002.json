Accomplishing the feat at West Deptford is even more impressive. \nBefore his arrival in 1991, West Deptford had 19 consecutive non-winning seasons. \nAnd it wasn't an immediate turnaround. West Deptford had losing records his first three seasons, but since then the Eagles have been rolling. \nFolsom has guided the Eagles to six South Jersey championships, and at 6-0 this year, West Deptford is a serious threat again in South Jersey Group 2. The Eagles entered the year with 13 straight seasons of nine or more wins. \nFolsom admitted it was special, and he began talking about all the people who helped along the way. \nThen he talked about his former players, most notably Nick Brandemarti, who was killed in the 9/11 attacks at the World Trade Center. \n\"There is so much support from our players,\" Folsom said. \"Nick Brandemarti had such an influence of where we are right now.\" \nForlsom had to pause before he finished that sentence, the words coming out slowly, because Brandemarti meant so much to him and he got into coaching to guide youngsters like him. \nWith all the memories he has gained, Folsom admitted this was no ordinary win. \n\"This is a big milestone for a community, not necessary for myself,\" he said. \nAnd the win came the West Deptford way, by running the ball in the Delaware Wing-T and making few mistakes. West Deptford only attempted one pass. \n\"This is what West Deptford football is all about,\" Folsom said. \"It is not going to change.\" \nCollingswood (4-3) hung in for a half, trailing just 14-7 at intermission but junior Quran Dozier put things away with three second half touchdown runs. \n\"It's special to be part of this with coach,\" Dozier said. \nThe win also clinched another championship, in the Colonial Liberty. The victories and titles have come so frequently, that it is difficult to remember the years when winning wasn't taken for granted. \nFolsom brought a high level of accountability to the program, and he works his players hard and himself even harder. It's not stretching things to say that he should rank among the top coaches in South Jersey history. \nHe would be embarrassed at that type of talk. All Folsom ever wants is an honest effort. And one can be assured moments after getting on the bus ride home from Collingswood, he was devising a way to earn win No. 201. \nWest Deptford 7 7 6 14 - 34 \nCollingswood 0 7 0 0 - 7 \nW: Kenny Lim 78 run (Mike Bilodeau kick) \nC: Zach Irwin 24 pass from Jovon Allie (Robert Upshur kick) \nW: Gio Gismondi 2 run (Bilodeau kick) \nW: Quran Dozier 2 run (kick failed) \nW: Dozier 3 run (Billodeau kick) \nW: Dozier 10 run (Billodeau kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:11:02.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
