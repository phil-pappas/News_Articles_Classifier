I'm trying to make everybody equal until later on and I visit LSU because I haven't visited there yet.\" \nSimpson has visited a handful of schools including Alabama, Clemson, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi St., and Tennessee, but still needs to shore up where he will take his five official visits. \nâ€œI want to come up for the Florida State game (at Clemson),\" Simpson said. \"I really want to get up there for that game. I haven't planned any of my officials yet, but LSU is also one of the places I want to go.\" \nFor Clemson, it's the family atmosphere that keeps the 6-4, 288-pounder coming back. \n\"It's mainly the family environment and how they keep it real with you,\" he said. \"The players are very involved in the recruiting process, too, and they tell me a lot of good things.\" \nSimpson has been keeping an eye on what the Tigers are doing this season. \n\"I've been able to watch two games - Notre Dame and Georgia Tech,\" he said. \"I feel like they are really improving. They've gotten better over the years since Dabo Swinney Dabo Swinney View Full Profile has been there.\" \nAs for South Carolina, the departure of head coach Steve Spurrier doesn't really change anything for Simpson as his main draw to the Gamecocks is interim head coach Shawn Elliott. \n\"It doesn't really affect me at all because the head football coach can't really do that much for me as far as playing for him and stuff like that,\" he said. \"The real reason I'm still considering Carolina is because of Coach Elliott. Coach Elliott is such a good coach.\" \nFor now though, Simpson will enjoy playing his final few high school football games with best friend and 2018 Clemson prospect Dakereon Joyner Dakereon Joyner", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:19:10.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
