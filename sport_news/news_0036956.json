Then, Casillas rushed out to save from another compatriot, Pedro Rodriguez , who had been played in by Willian.\nMeanwhile, Porto's formidable attack, featuring the brawn of Vincent Aboubakar and the mesmerising skill of Yacine Brahimi, were only showing flashes of their potential.\nBut when the Algerian winger Brahimi finally took on Chelsea right-back Branislav Ivanovic, who has endured a troubled start to the season, it brought instant reward in the 39th minute.\nHe jinked into the box and tried a shot which Asmir Begovic saved. Begovic could not, however, keep out the follow-up from Andre Andre.\nThe Dragao roared, but it was silenced right on the stroke of half-time. Ramires won a free-kick just outside the box and Willian stepped up to curl a beauty past a motionless Casillas for his third goal in as many games.\nPorto were stunned, but Chelsea were unable to build on that moment of brilliance by the Brazilian as the home side regained the lead just seven minutes after the restart, their captain Maicon stooping to head a Ruben Neves corner low past Begovic at his near post.\nCosta was desperately unlucky not to equalise virtually from the restart with a superb strike from wide on the left that looked to be arrowing into the far corner of the net but crashed back off the underside of the bar.\nNevertheless, the second goal galvanised a youthful and energetic Porto front six and they threatened to run riot as Giannelli Imbula stung the palms of Begovic and Aboubakar was denied by a crucial last-ditch block just six yards out.\nMourinho sent on Hazard and Matic, as well as Kenedy, but still Porto looked the stronger team. Indeed, they deserved to win by a greater margin, but Danilo's header from a Miguel Layun corner agonisingly came back off the far post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:20:23.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
