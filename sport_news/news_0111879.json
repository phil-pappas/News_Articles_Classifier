That type of problem is one any coach in the country would immediately sign on for.\n“It's a great problem to have and this is our first time having that problem,” Rice said. “The thing about our kids is, our kids want to win. We always talk about how amazing it is and how much can be accomplished when no one cares who gets the credit, and these guys have bought in to that already. Then, you bring in guys like Micah and Je'lon, who are known guys that can score the ball and known big-time guys, and they look to pass first. It makes everybody want to look for each other. Those guys, I've had to get on them both, and Justin also, to shoot more.”\nHornbeak is already a proven commodity at the Division I level, having started 29 of the 61 games he played in over his first two seasons at the University of Oklahoma. Seaborn will make his collegiate debut against the Bruins on Nov. 13, and is expected to crack the rotation immediately. When he does so, he will be joined by experience in Rice’s program.\nRobinson appears to be a mortal lock as the opening-night starter at the point. He has started 58 of 61 career games, including all 33 games last season on his way to being named first-team All-MAAC last winter as a sophomore. James had his sophomore season cut short by toe surgery and is on the mend from an elbow injury this preseason, but is a proven perimeter defender and often-explosive offensive player when he gets going to the hoop.\nTilghman played in all 33 games last season as a freshman, and has picked his play up in recent months, first on the team’s spring trip to China and now in the early going during preseason.\n“That's a great problem,” Robinson said. “Anybody can have an off-night, but I'm not banking on five guys having an off-night all on the same night. If I'm off, you've got Je'lon, Micah, Austin, 'Jiggy' all there to back me up. At least one of us is going to be on, so I think it's fair to say we have a lot of depth.”\n“We'd rather have too much than too little,” Hornbeak said. “It's good that you can always give everything you have on the court and then have someone that's going to back you up at a high level.”\nAdding to the good problem of depth is that within that depth, there is versatility. Hornbeak is 6-foot-4 and capable of playing and guarding any one of three positions on the floor. Rice has also singled out the 6-foot-5 Seaborn this preseason as capable of guarding three positions, while James, before the toe surgery, was having a fine season defensively, notably against high-major guards.\nAll of the options at Rice’s disposal have led he and his staff to do a lot of mixing and matching during practice in an effort to decide what works best. Throw in versatile 6-foot-6 redshirt senior Deon Jones, a third-team All-MAAC selection last winter, and Monmouth has the capability to go with several different small lineups.\nLast season, the Hawks found much success with small lineups featuring three guards out top, plus 6-foot-6 Andrew Nicholas and 6-foot-8 Brice Kofane down low.\nAccording to authoritative stats-based website KenPom.com, of Monmouth’s 10 most-frequently used lineups over its last five games last season, eight of the 10 featured either Nicholas or Jones at power forward.\n“We're gonna have a lot of combinations and I even like how it looks with two big guys,” Rice said. “We'll be better on the boards, and then it will be hard to deal with the three guys on the perimeter, regardless of which three we go with. It's going to be fun. The kids are working hard. There will be a lot of early challenges, but we're excited for all of it. I think we have a great chance to have some success early, but if we get punched in the face, then we'll see what we're made of.”\n“It's a good problem to have, having a lot of guards because you're always competing against somebody,” Seaborn said. “Me and Je'lon are going at each other every day, so that's helping me get better. That's my matchup, Je'lon or Deon, so I feel like I'm getting better.”\nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman4@gannettnj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:07:04.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
