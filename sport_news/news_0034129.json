President Michael Fitts says the university is looking to make cuts to both its operations and its workforce.\nThe university is offering a buyout program, hoping staff members will take part in voluntarily. Details should be available to employees by October 21st. If enough people don't opt to take part in the buyout program, Fitts says the university may be forced to consider layoffs.\nIn addition to a smaller staff, Tulane is also planning changes to its policies for overtime pay, sick leave and vacation time. The university says the changes will make it more consistent with other universities. Those changes are expected to take effect on July 1, 2016.\nAdditionally, the university is looking to cut operations in areas that include Admissions and Enrollment, Summer Programming and Student Housing Utilization. An Operational Review committee began meeting in January, to find areas to cut that would have the least impact on university operations.\nFitts says Tulane is now preparing for the largest capital campaign in the university's history, and says it recent rise in the US News rankings to #41 among national universities should be advantageous.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
