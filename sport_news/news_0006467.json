Mr Manohar and Mr Khan will speak to each other in evening today and tomorrow they are coming to Delhi for another round of talks,\" IPL Chairman and senior Board functionary Rajiv Shukla told PTI.\nThe protesting Sena workers were later taken into custody by the police.\nShouting slogans against Pakistan and the PCB chairman, the Sena workers surrounded Manohar, asking him not to have any ties with the neighbouring country, which they said sponsors terrorism.\nWaving black and saffron flags, the workers sought to know from Manohar if he would go ahead with his meeting with the PCB chief here.\nSena Vibhag Pramukh Pandurang Sakpal told reporters that his party is firm that there should be no cricket matches between the two countries.\nAsked about Sena being a part of the Maharashtra government, Sakpal said, \"The government will do its job, we will do ours.\"\n\"What we did today is Sena's stance,\" he said.\nManohar had invited Khan for talks on the much-anticipated cricket series scheduled in December.\nKhan and PCB's executive committee head Najam Sethi are in the city for the meeting after discussing the planned series with BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur earlier on the sidelines of the ICC meeting in Dubai.\nThakur had assured him that a final decision could be taken later this month and conveyed Manohar's invitation to visit India.\nThere is speculation that the two neighbours could play either a bilateral series in the UAE or agree to a possible triangular series in December also involving Bangladesh.\nUnion Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Congress leader Manish Tewari condemend the incident.\nTiwari described the incident as \"abominable\" and said law and order had completely broken down in Maharashtra.\nHe said Mumbai had been reduced to \"mobocracy\", citing a spate of recent incidents, including the cancellation of ghazal singer Ghulam Ali's show due to Sena's protests.\n\"It is extremely unfortunate... This is extremely abominable. Law and order has completely broken down in Maharashtra. The President of India should take cognizance of this,\" he said.\nIn the recent days, Sena activists had blackened the face of former BJP strategist Sudheendra Kulkarni, Chairman of the Observer Research Foundation, over his refusal to cancel the book launch function of former Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, prompting strong condemnation from political parties.\nThe Shiv Sena also forced the organisers to cancel the Mumbai concert of renowned Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali.\nâ€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:14:38.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
