Then again, the group's collective knowledge of the Rules of Golf will increase just as much.\nThe Class of 2015 is heavily weighted toward administration of the game, and that's fine. Between the Utah Section PGA and the Utah Golf Association, the game is managed well in this state. Among the group of Jeff Beaudry, Jimmy Blair, Mike Malaska, Mark Passey and Hansen, only Blair would qualify on his golf skills alone. And even he is being recognized as an entrepreneur as well as a player.\n  Saturday's dinner and induction ceremony will recognize a fivesome with deep roots in Utah golf, all products of high schools in the state â€” including two from Cyprus in Magna. The Utah Golf Hall of Fame, founded in 1991, will have 38 members.\nBeaudry will always have the distinction of being the first executive director of the Utah Section PGA, and his impact extends nationally and internationally now that he works for the PGA of America. Beyond that, his administrative style is so admired that having the section's \"Gentleman Jeff\" award named for him speaks for itself.\nA graduate of Cyprus High School and the University of Utah, Beaudry worked as an assistant pro at Mountain View Golf Course and head pro and general manager of the Copper Club. He joined the Utah Section PGA in its founding, after being part of the Rocky Mountain Section. The section office actually was his house in those early years.\nWhen the PGA Tour launched what is now known as the Web.com Tour, various PGA sections were asked to stage the events. Beaudry was heavily involved in that effort, with the Utah Classic held at Provo's Riverside Country Club from 1990-96. In the process, he helped make golf an official sport in Special Olympics International. That development stemmed from a clinic involving Special Olympics Utah athletes at Riverside, and the section's involvement with the organization has continued to evolve, with athletes serving as volunteers for the Siegfried & Jensen Utah Open. That relationship goes far beyond the usual tournament-charity affiliation.\nAs Beaudry once said, \"It went from us just wanting to write a check to actually making a difference in people's lives and changing perceptions.\"\nDescribing himself as \"so incredibly happy\" working for the Utah Section PGA, Beaudry moved to the PGA of America in 1998. He was named the western director of PGA employment services in 2013.\nBeaudry received the UGA's Gold Club Award in 2002, among other honors from the PGA and Special Olympics.\nMembers of the Utah Golf Hall of Fame are not selected to fill particular categories. If they were, Blair would qualify for multiple honors. He's a player, first and foremost, and also has built credentials as an entrepreneur and operator of golf facilities.\nMuch like 2011 inductee Jay Don Blake, Blair thinks of himself as an active player and is taken aback by receiving the award at this stage of his career. Yet he already has done enough to merit selection.\nAn alumnus of Ogden High School and BYU, Blair won the 1973 State Amateur and the 1981 Utah Open, giving him a rare distinction in Utah golf history. In between, he was part of the 1976 BYU team that finished second in the NCAA Championships and sent six players to the PGA Tour.\nBlair, 60, has thrived on the club professional level in Intermountain area tournaments, with four Wyoming Open victories among his achievements. He was named the Utah Section PGA Player of the Year in 1987 and 2000 and is a three-time Senior Player of the Year.\nHe has competed in six PGA Championships and has performed well in limited access to high-level senior events, including the Senior PGA Championship and the Senior British Open.\nAs a businessman, Blair was ahead of his time. The golf industry has recognized that the traditional approach to attracting players needs an overhaul. Blair made that discovery long ago, incorporating family activities into his Mulligan's Golf & Games facilities in Ogden and South Jordan. His current focus is managing SunRiver Golf Club in St. George, which he finds fulfilling.\nBlair considers the rise of his son, Zac, in becoming an established PGA Tour player the \"culmination\" of his life in golf, with more to come.\nHansen, a graduate of Logan High School and Utah State, is considered the consummate volunteer, on both the UGA and United States Golf Association levels. He'll contribute wherever he's needed, from a junior golf event to the U.S. Open.\nHansen received the USGA's Ike Grainger Award in 2013 for 25 years of service and was the UGA's Gold Club Award winner in 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:55:13.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
