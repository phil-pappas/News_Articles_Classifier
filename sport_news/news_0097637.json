When the call comes he ran toward danger. It was the last time he will respond to that call,\" Bratton said.\nThe shooting in Manhattan's East Harlem neighborhood happened while the 5-year veteran and his partners in the department's Housing Bureau were responding to a report of shots fired.\nWitnesses told the officers a man had fled on a foot path and the officers encountered another man who told them an assailant had stolen his bicycle at gunpoint.\nHolder and another officer confronted the armed man and there was an exchange of gunfire at East 120 Street and the FDR Drive, Bratton said. The officer was struck and the shooter fled on foot. The suspect was caught several blocks away with a gunshot wound to his leg.\nBratton said the suspect was expected to be released from a hospital early Wednesday and transferred to police custody. The suspect was not identified.\n\"We are humbled by Officer Randolph Holder's example, an example of service and courage and sacrifice,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \"Our hearts are heavy. We offer our thoughts and our prayers to his family.\"\nDe Blasio said Holder, who joined the force in July 2010, had an \"exemplary record\" as a police officer.\nPatrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said: \"New York City police officers everyday go out and carry themselves like superheroes but the reality is when we're attacked we bleed, when we bleed we die and when we die we cry.\"\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Lemire also contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
