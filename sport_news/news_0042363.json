Posted:  17 pm Panthers score last, top Argylls By Rick Teverbaugh   \nELWOOD — The Elwood Panthers made just enough big plays on offense and defense to come away with a 26-20 Sectional 16 victory over the Madison-Grant Argylls on Friday night. \nSophomore Jake Wilson rushed for 194 yards on 24 carries and scored three times for the Panthers. His 17-yard run with 4:31 to go in the contest provided the winning points. \nDefensively, Elwood made the big plays it needed in the final four minutes. \nIt appeared a missed extra point following Wilson’s last TD might play a role as the Argylls headed downfield on their final possession. On fourth-down-and-seven from their own 36, M-G quarterback Garrett Wilson turned a pass play into a 9-yard scamper for a first down to keep the drive intact. \nOn second-and-15, Wilson again dropped back to throw but he was swarmed by senior lineman Zane Boyer for a 6-yard loss. Two plays later the Argylls gave the ball up on downs. \nWithout any time outs, the visitors were powerless to stop the clock and Elwood wrapped up the victory. \n“The ultimate goal is to survive and advance,” said Elwood head coach Marty Wells. “We checked that box off. Offensively we struggled a lot. We’ve got to learn to answer the bell at 7 (p.m.). We did make some big plays.” \nBoyer also contributed offensively, rushing 16 times for 53 yards. \nThe first half was tightly contested with the Panthers controlling the ball more than the Argylls. \nElwood scored on a pair of big plays and held after a huge run by Madison-Grant. Sophomore Jake Wilson scored on a counter from 51 yards out to open the scoring in the first quarter. \nKaine Stone, in his only carry of the half, toted the ball into the endzone from 21 yards out and a 14-0 lead with 5:39 left in the half. \nMadison-Grant, unable to put it in the end zone early in the second quarter after a 43-yard run by Nate Kean put the ball on Elwood’s 17, got within a touchdown with 1:20 remaining on a 4-yard run by junior Luke Stroup. \nThe Argylls took rallied in the third quarter and outscored the home team 13-0 in the period. Watson hit Chase Bramel for a 16-yard scoring strike to tie the game at 14-14. Madison-Grant took the lead with 3:47 on the clock in the third on a 5-yard run by Stroup. \nStroup rushed 20 times in the game for 84 yards. Nate Kean ran seven times for 61 yards. \n“I couldn’t be much prouder of these kids,” said M-G coach Kyle Booher. “They don’t give up.” \nCritical mistakes by the Argylls have been an ongoing problem. “We have the wrong personnel in the wrong place on some plays. They are right 90 percent of the time, but those other times seem to come at critical times. I knew coming into this week we were ready to play.” \nElwood will play next Friday at either Winchester or Eastern.
