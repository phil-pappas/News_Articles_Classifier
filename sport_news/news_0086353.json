(DUSTIN BRADFORD / GETTY IMAGES) Tom Housenick Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Giants pitcher Vogelsong wears slightly painful reminder of how far he came. \nRyan Vogelsong looked down at the 2014 World Series championship ring that was weighing down his right ring finger Saturday morning in the living room inside the president's house at Kutztown University. \nThe three trophy-design on the right side of the monster ring was rubbing into his pinkie finger. \nIt was a slightly painful reminder of what was a long, painful run for the former Kutztown standout, who went from Division II star to Tommy John surgery to Japan to a pair of World Series titles with the San Francisco Giants. \nVogelsong, who pitched and played third base from 1996-98 at Kutztown, doesn't need any reminders of his path less traveled to the top of the major leagues' mountain. \n\"Not a day goes by that I don't think about [my path],\" Vogelsong said. \"It drives me on a daily basis, especially when you're 38 and still trying to play this game.\" \nVogelsong doesn't have a major league contract for 2016, but he's confident he'll find a home, whether it's back in San Francisco or one of the 29 other cities. \nFor Saturday, though, he was back home on the Berks County campus where he left with nine school records after being a fifth-round pick of the Giants in 1998. \nThe 6-foot-4, 215-pound Octorara High School product was the recipient of just the eighth Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference's Award of Merit, Kutztown University's third President's Medal and the key to the town of Kutztown during a ceremony. \nAt halftime of Kutztown's football game against East Stroudsburg, Vogelsong had his No. 14 jersey retired, the first in program history. \nOne of only two Kutztown baseball players to play in the major leagues, he doesn't only come to Kutztown to receive. \nIn the last couple of years, he has donated equipment and travel warmups to the Golden Bears program. Current Kutztown baseball players wore those warmups to Saturday's ceremony. \n\"When they walk into a restaurant, I want people to know they're on a baseball team,\" Vogelsong said. \"I try to give back to them so that they have a little more than I did.\" \nVogelsong homered on his last day in a Kutztown uniform in a doubleheader against West Chester. He also hit first major league home run in 2015 at Colorado. \nBut the right-hander has enjoyed an 11-year major league career because he can get hitters out. The 2011 National League All-Star was dominant during the Giants' run to a World Series title in 2012. He was 3-0 in four starts, allowing only three runs in 24 2/3 innings. \nVogelsong pitched well in Game 3 of the NL Division Series. It saved the Giants from being swept by the Reds, even though Cincinnati's Homer Bailey took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. \nHe also won Game 6 of the NLCS to get the Giants even against the Cardinals. \n\"I was never nervous in those playoffs,\" Vogelsong said. \"I was more amped up for Game 6 because the home crowd was going nuts. \n\"The thing that impressed me about that game was how sharp I was with all the emotion going on.\" \nVogelsong, who was with his wife, Nicole, and son, Ryder, also had close friend Steve Fitch with him at Saturday's ceremony. \nFitch and Vogelsong became friends playing in the Chest-Mont high school league, then came to Kutztown together. \nFitch still catches Vogelsong in the offseason. \n\"I remember him as a tall, lanky kid who threw hard,\" Fitch said. \"In high school, you could dominate if you threw hard. \n\"But here, it was his work ethic. He's sitting here now because we pushed each other.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:32:07.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
