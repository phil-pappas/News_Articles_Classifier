You can imagine how happy I am with that.\"\nBut that victory at Rio Tinto Stadium last weekend was also big because it marked FCD's 13 th shutout of 2015, equaling a club record set in 1999 under the franchise's original coach, Dave Dir.\nPareja played on that '99 squad and should FCD blank San Jose on Sunday for its 14 th clean sheet of 2015, would welcome that record falling. \"All those things are good, especially for the spirit of the group. You have to validate that with trophies and championship at the end,\" Pareja said. \"That's what matters, but it says a lot about the good job that the boys have done this year. Every time I hear that records are being broken by these guys, it's good news. I like that.\"\nBesides clinching the West and a berth in the CCL, something else Dallas secured by beating RSL was a first-round bye in the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs, giving his club a few extra days of rest, which FCD needs with midfielder Kellyn Acosta, a Plano native, and defender Zach Loyd, Dallas' longest-tenured player, both currently nursing groin issues.\nPlayoff First 11 Far from Set\nOn Sunday at Toyota Stadium, FCD will conclude the regular season by hosting San Jose. A win against the Earthquakes coupled with a loss or tie by the New York Red Bulls at Chicago would give Dallas the MLS Supporters' Shield, awarded to the club with the best regular-season record, for the first time. With the start of the playoffs less than 12 days away, does Pareja have a first 11 in mind? No. \"I don't have my 11, not even for tomorrow's training now,\" Pareja said on Tuesday evening. \"Seriously. I'm in competition mode all the time and I like that group to be in that too.\"\nFCD in Regular-Season Finales\nDallas is 4-10-5 all-time in regular-season finales and 2-3-3 at home to end the season. Dallas, who lost 2-0 to Portland on Oct. 25, 2014 in Frisco to end the regular season, last won a finale in Oct. 2003, beating Colorado 4-3 at Dragon Stadium in Southlake.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-10-21T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:27:54.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
