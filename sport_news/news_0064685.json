They knew they were getting a lot of untapped potential that would hopefully help them that season, but ideally turn into something special down the road. \nThe refinement process is in its early stages; Friday’s game, in which he scored in his second straight contest, was just his 11th as a Bruin. How long it takes remains to be seen, but the Bruins feel that there’s work to do, just as the Lightning did after spending the sixth overall pick on the sharp-shooting right wing in 2010. Claude Julien feels Connolly has bad habits that need shaking; Connolly wants to follow whatever orders he’s given to stick in the lineup. \nAfter getting looks with the third and first lines in addition to the second power play unit over the first four games of the season, Connolly was made a healthy scratch last Saturday as the Bruins opted to keep fourth-line grinder Tyler Randell in the lineup over Connolly in Brad Marchand ’s return. When Julien returned Connolly to the lineup on Tuesday, Connolly scored and drew a penalty that led to a goal on consecutive shifts. On Friday, he went to the net and whacked a loose puck past Jaroslav Halak to give the Bruins an early lead in a game they’d eventually win. \n“I think everywhere I’ve been, it’s been if you play well, you keep playing and get put in the lineup,” Connolly said this week. “I think with Claude, he’s a little bit more… he’s in your face and he holds guys accountable a little bit more than maybe coaches in the past, but that’s a good thing. He keeps guys on their toes, and he’s a guy that’s going to get the best out of his players. Obviously, I’ve been happy with him and we kind of have an understanding of each other now. That’s going to be good for me moving forward, to kind of understand what he wants from me, what he expects, and we’ll go from there.” \nConnolly, of course, didn’t have the opportunity to get much of a feel for Julien last season, as the broken finger he suffered in his second practice limited him to just five games with Boston late in the season. He came into this season on a one-year contract looking to establish himself more than he did in Tampa, and Julien’s optimistic that can happen. \n“I have a lot faith in this player that he can be a good player and I expressed that to him,” Julien said. “I think right now it’s just about being coached. Sometimes it just depends on where you’ve come from. I’m not talking about Tampa, but even junior, he was a first-round pick, a great player on a team that didn’t have a lot of success. Sometimes when you don’t have success — we all know, we’ve seen it before — we all get some of those bad habits, so you try and work with the player to make them better. He’s got all the tools to be a good player and we’ve seen spurts of it here since he’s been with us. We’re just trying to make him better.” \nThe skill has always been apparent with Connolly, who could be a dangerous player once his hockey smarts catch up to his hands and his skating. At the very least, Connolly’s been more disciplined so far this season than his five-game cup of coffee in the spring, which saw him take five minor penalties in a two-game span. \nJulien thinks Connolly takes coaching well, which is encouraging. Connolly says he’s always been a target of tough love from coaches. \nAfter turning pro in the 2011-12 season, Connolly reported to the Syracuse Crunch of the AHL for the 2012 lockout. Syracuse was coached by current Lightning coach Jon Cooper. Connolly said Cooper, with whom he had a good relationship, was similar to how Julien is with him now. \n“Every single day, it seemed he was in my face,” Connolly said. “Watching video, grilling me a little bit about things. I owe him a lot for improving me as a player that year. He’s taught me a lot, even though last year maybe the numbers weren’t there -- I was scoring a little bit more -- I kind of had to adjust to a certain role last year. I was on the fourth line a lot and I was playing more in your face, so I had to adjust that way. Me and Coop, we still have a very good relationship.” \nIf Connolly keeps scoring, he and Julien will get along famously. He’s not going to get any better if he’s in the press box, however, so the B’s would be wise to keep him in the lineup and give him the leash that they’ve given to their also developing young defensemen. \nWhere he fits and where he’ll succeed remains in question. He’s loved playing with Bergeron, which makes sense given that riding shotgun with Bergeron and Marchand almost guarantees success. Loui Eriksson has arguably been Boston’s best player this season, however, so the Bergeron line is more of a sure thing with the Swedish veteran than the still-developing Connolly. \nWhen Beleskey returns, the thinking here is that Connolly should stay with Bergeron, Eriksson should move to Ryan Spooner’s line (making Eriksson a very overqualified third-liner) and Chris Kelly should move to the fourth line despite deserving better so far this season. Connolly could also play on the fourth line, something that may raise eyebrows given his skill level, though he did it at points last season. \nWherever Connolly plays, he’d like to make enough of an impact to stay in the lineup. He’s got expectations for himself and knows his coach does too. \n“With Claude, for me and the guys, they know where they stand,” Connolly said. “He holds guys accountable. He doesn’t really care who you are. He’s going to put the best lineup out there to win. That makes guys give it their all every night and that’s what we need moving forward.“", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:19:52.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
