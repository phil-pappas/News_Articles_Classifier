The 31-year-old Casey played for Kubiak in Houston from 2009-12 and was signed in Denver to be a big part of the zone-blocking scheme. However, the unbeaten Broncos have put Manning more in the shotgun and pistol formations the last two games. Casey played just 20 snaps on offense before his release Saturday to make room for defensive end Derek Wolfe, who is returning from a four-game drug suspension and is expected to start Sunday at Oakland (2-2). Casey is due the remaining $750,000 of his salary.
