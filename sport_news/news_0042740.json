Still, Quarless provided quarterback Aaron Rodgers with another veteran receiving option and blocker. \nQuarless, who is on injured reserve/designated to return, would be eligible to play again in Week 12 on Thanksgiving night against the Chicago Bears. He's encouraged by a recent conversation he had with player personnel director Eliot Wolf. \n\"Sometimes with injuries, guys tend to rush things and reinjure themselves,\" Quarless said. \"One of his main things was, `take your time, get healed and we'll be ready for you to come back.'\" \nProduction is coming from other areas. \nRichard Rodgers is turning into a viable receiving option with two touchdown catches. \nRookie Ty Montgomery has played well so far in seeing more snaps with Adams sidelined. The running game is averaging 136 yards a game, and backs Eddie Lacy and James Starks are effective check-down options. \nThe constant through the turnover is Aaron Rodgers. The MVP quarterback has thrown for 11 touchdowns and no interceptions through the first four games. \n\"So he just does all of the little things right. And when you have a program, your best players have to be your best people,\" coach Mike McCarthy said. \"He makes people around him better.\" \nNOTES: Starting RT Bryan Bulaga was limited for a second straight day in his return from a left knee injury. Position coach James Campen said Bulaga looked good, though no decision has been made on Bulaga's availability for Sunday. ... LB Clay Matthews (quad) was limited. ... S Morgan Burnett (calf) missed practice again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:11:35.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
