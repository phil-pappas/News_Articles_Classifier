The Cowboys and the Bears (3-2, 2-0) are 1-2 in defense and each is giving up fewer than 70 yards rushing in conference play. \n“There’s the offensive-defensive philosophy that you have to run the football and stop the run; that’s their (the Cowboys’) creed,” said UCA coach Steve Campbell. “It’s will vs will.” \nIn a 21-7 McNeese victory over Southeastern Louisiana last week, neither team scored in an old-school, exchange-of-punts in the second half. \n“They have guys on defense who can really get to the football,” said Campbell. \n“They are very good against the run.” said Southeastern Louisiana coach Steve Roberts. “They have mobile guys who are not going to be out of position. And they tackle really well in space. That what got us more than anything. We had guys in space and they didn’t blink; they got us down.” \n“Probably a little different than some defenses we have had is we are built more on speed,” said McNeese coach Matt Viator. “We have some guys with speed up front and we have speed on the perimeter where we can cover people.” \n“People have really struggled running the football on them,’ said Campbell. “Then, the people that are just dropping back and throwing it every snap, they’re getting sacked. So, you have to pound it in there. You have to be able to run the football to create some balance.” \nAnd the UCA defense? \n“Central Arkansas’ front seven on defense just suffocates you,” said Houston Baptist coach Vic Shealy, whose team managed a minus-9 yards rushing last week in a 43-7 loss to the Bears. \n“I like the way \ntheir guys are playing up front,” said Viator. “They have been good against the running game and that’s including Oklahoma State. We know about (defensive end) Jonathan Woodard because we have played against him. But those three other kids along the front are pretty good.” \nThe teams also has some offensive firepower. Quarterback Hayden Hildebrand leads the league in pass efficiency and running back Dominique Thomas is the league’s leading rusher. \nMcNeese quarterback Daniel Sams, a transfer from Kansas State, is the team’s top rusher at 421 yards. The Cowboys are third in scoring at 33.2 points per gamed and fourth behind UCA in total offense (435.4 to 432.2). UCA is first in the SLC in net punting (41.6), while sophomore Brandon Cox of Conway leads in punt returns after his 93-yarder for a touchdown last week against HBU. \nBecause of a quirk in the SLC schedule, the teams, who have had some great games against each other (often for a share of the league lead or championship), did not play last year. \nSaturday marks the renewal of the Southland’s newest traveling trophy game, the “Red Beans & Rice Bowl.” The Cowboys currently own the trophy after a victory in Conway two years ago. \n“Just going to Conway and playing UCA is always hard,” said Viator, whose Cowboys are 1-4 against the Bears in Conway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:24:45.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
