The Lady Panthers, who were the best team in Region 5- , will host Winder Barrow in a best-of-three series.If Chapel Hill advances, it will face either Ola or Harris County in the next round, which is scheduled to begin Oct. 21. Last season, the Lady Panthers advanced all the way to Columbus and finished fifth in the state.Meanwhile, Alexander, which is also a member of Region 5- , sits on the other side of the bracket and will host a series against Flowery Branch, starting today at 5 p.m.“They are a solid team obviously since they are in the playoffs,” Alexander softball coach Zack Graham said. “They got a little speed up top and they got some hitters in the middle.”If the Lady Cougars and Lady Falcons split the two games today, they will play a decisive Game 3 on Thursday.“It’s always a nice thing to have home-field advantage,” Graham said. “I feel like anytime you can host you did what you needed to do in the regular season to earn that right.”Graham has not decided who his starting pitcher would be in Game 1.“I feel like we are playing good ball,” Graham said. “We had a good practice Monday. Hopefully, we keep this thing rolling and play a while.”If Alexander prevails in this series, it will meet Northside-Columbus or Starr’s Mill in the next round. Last year, the Lady Cougars made it to the second round.In volleyball, there will be three teams competing for a state title, beginning Thursday. From Class , Douglas County, a No. 4 seed, will visit Lakeside-DeKalb. The Lady Vikings are led in kills by Gabrielle Morse, who has 334 kills in 94 sets. Majesty Ferguson has 286 kills in 93 sets.Like their softball counterparts, the Alexander and Chapel Hill volleyball teams also made the postseason. However, the Lady Cougars will travel to play Gainesville and the Lady Panthers will host Winder Barrow.If the Lady Cougars record an upset, they will visit Ola or Southwest DeKalb on Tuesday. If the Lady Panthers win, they will meet Druid Hills or Northgate on Tuesday.
