JONESVILLE â€“ In sports, as in life 'it's not where you start, but where you finish' that matters and Thursday night, Jonesville finished with a 3-0 win over Quincy on the soccer pitch in Jonesville. Jonesville almost didn't have a start to the season as a lack of numbers almost cancelled it altogether. And the Comets did have to forfeit a couple of games early. Then, with little time for conditioning, the Comets were often run ragged by the opposition - ending up on the short end of a number of one-sided losses, and logged just one win. However, over the past week, the Comets have come together and are playing their best soccer down the stretch. \"There is a big difference in the way we are playing now compared to the way we were playing at the beginning of the year,\" Jonesviille varsity coach Darin Young said. \"I was excited to get to this game because of the way that everything came together at the Hillsdale match and we played them really tough,\" Young added. \"I was expecting a good game today. We've been doing really well in practice - doing a good job moving the ball.\" Quincy coach Nick Warner was not pleased with the Orioles effort. \"Pitiful! Lack of energy. No desire,\" Warner said. \"Not keeping your head up, not playing your feet. It that plain and simple.\" Jonesville was aggressive from the start, and the Comets took advantage of a 'handball' call in the box on Quincy for their first score, when Noah Smith knocked in a penalty-kick at 36:14 of the first half. While Jonesville didn't score over the rest of the half, they kept the Orioles back on their heels. However, there was a bit of a tense moment when the Comets Drew Young collided with a Quincy player and injured his ankle. He was helped off the field, but is okay said Comet coach Young. The Comets continued their aggressive style into the second half, and kept the pressure on the Oriole defense, and Quincy goal keeper Jared Brown. Despite giving up three goals, Brown did make eight saves in the match. \"He (Brown) made some nice saves, one-on-one, but didn't get much help from our defense,\" Warner said. \"They weren't clearing the ball.\" Struggling to clear the ball out of their end of the field, Quincy gave Jonesville numerous scoring opportunities and finally at 21:01, on a break-away, Smith dribbled in and past Brown, and scored for a 2-0 Comet edge. Then with 7:33, the Comets tallied goal No. 3. Smith came in from the left, fired but came up shy. Following on the play, Shayam Patel corralled the ball and put it in the back of the net. for the final 3-0 score. Page 2 of 2 - There was another tense moment for Jonesville in the second-half when after playing the first half in goal, Comet Koti Ellis took to the field and injured his foot in a collision with the Quincy keeper. Ellis exited the game under his own power though and is okay, coach Young said. Replacing Ellis in goal for the Comets was sophomore Fred Yaniga, who proved a fan favorite - drawing a cheer of approval when he slapped down and then grabbed a Quincy shot for his first save in goal. \"I played him (Yaniga) in goal a lithe at practice the other day and a couple of times,\" coach Young said. \"He's has good position in the goal and is very alert. I'm want work with him for one of our goal-keepers for next year.\" Looking toward the finish of the season, Young said. \"This to me just reaffirms that if they (the Comets) can continue to play this way, and I believe we will continue to play this way, and hopefully have some more wins before the end of the season and in Districts.\" Jonesville plays at Olivet on Saturday. Quincy is at Jackson Christian on Monday.
