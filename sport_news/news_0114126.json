Without revealing the exact nature of the injury, Bylsma said Kane won't require surgery after hurting his medial collateral ligament.\nHe was hurt while chasing down a puck in the right corner and was struck in the knee by Devils defenseman David Schlemko.\nKane is a top-line forward who has a goal and two assists in eight games.\nThe injury is the latest setback for Kane, who was sidelined by a season-ending shoulder injury when Buffalo acquired him in a trade with Winnipeg in February.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Sabres+forward+Kane+out+4-6+weeks+with+left+knee+injury", "http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url="], "published": "2015-10-27T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:23:41.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
