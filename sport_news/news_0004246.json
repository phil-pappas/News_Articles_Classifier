Second stringers are 1-3 this season, the lone victory belonging to polarizing Johnny Manziel of the Cleveland Browns.\nSo what can be done to give understudies – the Pittsburgh Steelers' Michael Vick, Chicago Bears' Jimmy Clausen and Dallas Cowboys' Brandon Weeden are expected to start in Week 4 – a fighting chance, especially when many are asked to replace the indispensable face of a franchise?\n\"When you're playing with a backup, at that position especially, it really puts a premium on coaching,\" NFL Network analyst Heath Evans told USA TODAY Sports.\nUSA TODAY\nBrandon Weeden bristles at criticism of Cowboys' downfield passing\nAt the start of his career, Evans was a member of the Seattle Seahawks when they were cycling between Matt Hasselbeck and Trent Dilfer under center. In 2008, while with the New England Patriots, Evans watched reigning MVP Tom Brady go down in the season opener with a torn knee ligament, thrusting inexperienced Matt Cassel into the breach.\n\"What I saw in 2008 was so many things changed to benefit Matt,\" said Evans, a fullback. \"I remember sitting on the bench a lot because we went to a lot of four- and five-wides (multiple receivers). We kept our field spread thin so Matt could see everything ... different things week to week that really allowed Matt to get comfortable down in and down out.\n\"Matt became our quarterback, and he became a really good one that year.\"\nOf course, that kind of tactic probably wouldn't suit Vick or Weeden, who are hoping to keep their teams’ Super Bowl hopes alive before passing the baton back to Ben Roethlisberger and Tony Romo, respectively.\nUSA TODAY\nWhich 3-0 NFL team has best chance to go undefeated?\n\"In this modern world of football we live in, the backup quarterback gets zero reps. None. So I'm gonna try to get him as much work as I can, get him caught up, and get him some confidence going with some of the things he likes,\" ESPN Monday Night Football analyst and former NFL head coach Jon Gruden told USA TODAY Sports.\n\"I think Pittsburgh is in a more difficult situation than Dallas because Weeden's had over a year in the system. ... I think that they're gonna do some of the things Michael likes within the confines of their offense and probably add a few things that Michael Vick brings to the table.\"\nGet all the latest news on the Pittsburgh Steelers! Check out USA TODAY Sports' SteelersWire ! Vick, who has only been with the Steelers for a month, is also at a disadvantage given his first start of the season comes Thursday against the Baltimore Ravens with just three days of prep time. Now in his 15th year, he's under no illusion that offensive coordinator Todd Haley can customize the playbook for him overnight.\n\"You can't change everything in one week. I think you have to just kind of go with what you've got,\" said Vick, who's 3-12 in his past 15 starts.\n\"Can't go out there and try to improvise on a short week and change things around,\" he said. \"There's a ton of good things we have in our offense. I just have to go out there and let it work for me.\"\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL Week 3 power rankings: Steelers drop out of top 10 | 02:12 USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes breaks down the latest power rankings.
