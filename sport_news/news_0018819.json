Last month, Cheryl Lynn Lucero, 46, was convicted of murdering Roberts, with whom she had an affair. On Sept. 4, a jury of four men and eight women deliberated for two days before convicting Lucero of murdering Roberts. Sentencing was originally set for Tuesday, but Tuolumne County Superior Court Judge Kevin M. Seibert agreed to a defense request to delay it until Oct. 27. Dressed in a jail jumpsuit, Lucero appeared in the Department 4 courtroom via video conference from Tuolumne County Jail. Tuolumne County Deputy Public Defender Dana Gross said she received a document Tuesday that Lucero sent to the Tuolumne County Probation Department. “I would like an opportunity to review that,” she said. Gross added that Clay Bedford, Lucero’s other attorney, is out of the office at this time, and she would like Bedford to also review the document. Amy Lindblom, senior probation officer of the Tuolumne County Probation Department, told Seibert her department received a letter Monday that was written by Lucero. The letter was addressed to Tuolumne County Superior Court Judge James A. Boscoe, who oversaw Lucero’s trial. After Tuesday’s hearing, Lindblom said the probation department has received “several” letters written by Lucero since she was convicted — all addressed to Boscoe. It is unknown if the letters will be read aloud in court. Roberts, 49, of Sonora, was found shot to death the morning of Feb. 16, 2014, in an automobile shop he rented near his home on Mono Way. He was found lying faceup on the ground by a person he was scheduled to meet about renting space in the building. Throughout her trial, which began Aug. 10, Lucero was vague about how long she and Roberts were involved in an affair, but the prosecution has said it lasted about three years. In an April court hearing, Bedford said his client had acknowledged that she and Roberts had been having an affair for three years. Lucero was arrested June 18, 2014, and charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Roberts. Roberts’ death was Sonora’s first homicide since February 2001, when Michael Gilligan, 44, of Sonora, was murdered by three homeless men. Lucero faces 50 years to life in prison.
