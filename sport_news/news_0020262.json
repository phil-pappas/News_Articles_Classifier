The confidence level is there, the required result is there as well, because we know exactly what is needed -- a 0-0 is not even a good result. To score goals, we have to attack.\" \nBayern has eliminated Arsenal from the Champions League twice in the past three seasons, but Wenger seems confident of a victory this time round. \n\"What we want to do is play up to our level, because that will be needed -- we play against a big team,\" he said. \n\"We feel a bit that the pain inflicted in Europe was a bit by ourselves, maybe subconsciously we thought, 'Anyway we will win these'. Now to correct that we need a great performance,\" Wenger added. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:05:25.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
