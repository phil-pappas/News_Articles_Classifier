(Jason Getz/USA Today Sports) \nIt will be a reunion of sorts on Sunday when the Washington Redskins square off against Atlanta Falcons , who have a number of former Redskins on the team. Along with offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan and quarterbacks coach Matt LaFleur , wide receiver Leonard Hankerson and guard Chris Chester both play significant roles for the Falcons offense. \nHankerson, the Redskins’ third-round pick in 2011, is second on the Falcons with 241 receiving yards and two touchdowns. He’s averaging 60.3 yards per game, serving as the team’s second-leading receiver behind Julio Jones. The Miami product failed to remain healthy during his four years with the Redskins. He played just 30 games, including just one last season. Wide receiver Leonard Hankerson, left, shows off the catching radius that impressed Dan Quin against the Giants.

I think it’s the catching radius that he has. There could be a ball that’s way up high, he can go up to get it, or it’s out of bounds and he has the length to extend to go get it. He’s been a real factor for us on third down as well. He’s off to a great start with us. He worked extremely hard to come back, as you guys know, from all the injuries. He’s just off to a terrific start with us. He’s gained the respect of the people here by the style and the attitude that he plays with.” \nThe Redskins didn’t re-sign Hankerson during the offseason. Instead, he agreed to a one-year deal with Atlanta worth $1 million. Through a quarter of the season, the deal has been a bargain for the Falcons’ offense. \n“Early on, I knew Hank was going to be a solid player for us because he showcased it during OTAs and during training camp,” Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan said. “I mean, he made a lot of plays during that time. I think it’s translated into early success for him this season, so I knew kind of right when we got him here and had a chance to work with him just a little bit, I knew he was going to help us out.” Chris Chester, left, and Kory Lichtensteiger, right, walk with London Fletcher after a 27-20 win over Philadelphia on Dec. 23, 2012. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nChester spent six seasons with the Redskins, starting every game at right guard during his tenure. In his 10th season, he has served the same role for Atlanta through four games. The Redskins released Chester after the drafting Brandon Scherff with the fifth overall pick. Like Hankerson, the Falcons signed Chester to a one-year deal. \n“I knew when we released him that he would have some opportunities,” Washington center Kory Lichtensteiger said. “It speaks to him to the quality of work that he put out there that he was able to sign a deal immediately, to get a good deal, to play for a good team and come in and start right away. I’m very happy for him, and I know he deserves everything he’s gotten.” \nThere was some trash talk occurring earlier in the week between Chester and Lichtensteiger, who described Chester as one of the easiest guys in the locker room to get along with. The line between the two has gone silent as they inch closer to kickoff. \n“Now it’s just cold-shoulder silence,” Lichtensteiger said. \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:29:59.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
