(Photo: via Web) Beijing : Extending their incredible unbeaten record, Sania Mirza and Martina Hingis on Saturday lifted their eighth trophy of the season and fourth in a row, winning the WTA China Open. The top seeds faced stiff resistance from sixth seed Taipei girls Hao-Ching Chan and Yung-Jan Chan before winning 6-7 (9), 6-1, 10-8 in the final which lasted one hour and 40 minutes. In the match tie-breaker, the two pairs went neck and neck and the score read 7-7 at one stage, but Sania and Hingis won three of the next four points to seal the issue. It is the fourth title in a row for the Sania-Martina pair. In a remarkable run, they have dropped only two sets in their last 17 matches in four tournaments. It is the ninth title for Sania in 2015 and the eighth with Swiss great Hingis. They won titles at Indian Wells, Miami, Charleston, Wimbledon, the US Open, Guangzhou and Wuhan before Saturday’s win. Rafa flogs fognini, sets up Djoker date Rafael Nadal reached his first hard-court final in more than a year on Saturday, beating Fabio Fognini 7-5, 6-3 in the men’s semifinals. The struggling Spaniard will face top-seeded Novak Djokovic in Sunday’s final. In the other semifinal, Djokovic brushed aside Nadal’s fourth-seeded compatriot in straight sets 6-2, 6-3. The third-seeded Nadal’s previous hard-court final was at the Sony Open in Miami in March 2014. The Spaniard last won a hard-court tournament two months before that in Doha, Qatar. “For me, (to) be in the final is a great event. Very happy with that result,” Nadal said. In the women’s section, Switzerland’s Timea Bacsinszky came back from a set down and defeated sixth seed from Serbia Ana Ivanovic 5-7, 6-4, 6-1 to reach the title clash. With this result, she’s now assured of making the top 10 for the first time in her fledgling career. She will butt heads with the fast-rising Garbine Muguruza of Spain in the final. The fifth-seeded Spaniard also came back from a one-set deficit to defeat Poland’s fourth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska in three sets 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. sports tennis Sania Mircza WTA China Open Martina Hingis Also Read ICC World T20: Can Indian spinners weather Gayle storm?
