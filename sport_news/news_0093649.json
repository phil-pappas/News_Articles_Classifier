The idea of replacing the aging Community Corrections Center on West Russell Street has been talked about for the past three years and on Monday, the county took the first step in replacing it. But there are still a lot of unanswered questions; the main one is how to fund it. \nThe Minnehaha County Sheriff and others met with county commissioners and architects to look at three options that came out of a building committee that's been studying alternative ways to house a growing number of inmates. \n\"We don't have enough secure beds, regular jail beds to address that growing inmate population,\" Sheriff Milstead told the group. \nMilstead says the time is now for the county to build because he says it would take another three years before it's open and that's going to put even more pressure on an already crowded jail. \n\"We've got to decide ourselves how fast we're going to do this,\" Minnehaha County Commissioner Dick Kelly said. \nAfter two hours of discussions and looking at the three options, the one they decided on would add a new jail east of the current one at an estimated cost of over $42 million. But it would eliminate the parking lot and they say that'll need to be addressed, along with how to fund it. \n\"We may be able to figure out how to build this with bonding, but how do you come up with the money for the operations going forward, because it's going to significantly increase the county's budget, which most people know we already have troubles with our funding,\" Minnehaha County Commissioner Chairwoman Cindy Heiberger said. \nThose operational costs they've projected could be close to a half billion dollars for the next 20 years and that could fall directly on taxpayers. But they say they'll cross that issue when it's time. \n\"I hope we're moving forward in the next four or five months, but I don't think we're going to be breaking ground in the next four to five months,\" Heiberger said. \nMilstead says to address some of the crowding now, he has 700 non-violent inmates who are currently being monitored at home.
