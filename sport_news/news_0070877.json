That may be due in part to his ball-hawking ability. \nHe was redshirted in his first year on campus, but made an immediate impact once he was eligible last year. \nLast season, Odum served as a defensive back and appeared in 12 games in his freshman season. He finished the season second on the Bears in tackles with 77 total tackles, with 47 of those coming from a solo variety. \nAs a defensive back last season, he had eight tackles for a loss of 27 yards, one interception, three pass breakups, one forced fumble and one blocked kick. He had a career-high in tackles in last season’s finale against Sam Houston State University with 15 total tackles. \nIn high school, Odum was a two-time AAA-6A All-Region selection at Central High School in Millington, Tennessee, as a defensive back and punt returner. He was also a two-time sectional qualifier in track and field, team captain and placed on the Honor Roll. \nThrough six games, Odum has lead the team in tackles in four games with his best game coming in UCA’s 49-21 win over Northwestern State University on Sept. 9, where he recorded 11 total tackles. \n“George is very tenacious and high-motor guy,” coach Steve Campbell said. “He’s got great speed and a lot of innate linebacker ability.” \nOdum has been a leader for the defense so far this season and he showcased that leadership in the Bears’ 28-13 loss to McNeese State University last Saturday. \nUCA’s defense arguably had its best defense on display against the Cowboys in the Red Beans & Rice Bowl, and Odum again lead the charge in tackles with nine. \n“Our coaches told us to smash the superbacks and tight ends to combat reach blocks, and we had to set the edge real hard, so that will stop the run,” Odum said. \nThis week, the Bears face a tough challenge in Lamar University’s junior running back Kade Harrington, who is leading all of the Football Championship Subdivision in rushing yards with 1,115. \n“We are setting our defensive ends away from him, so me and (Jonathan) Woodard are going to be there if he tries to break away,” Odum said. \nIt’s a challenge. Harrington’s rushing total only trails LSU’s Leonard Fournette’s 1,202 rushing yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:33:47.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
