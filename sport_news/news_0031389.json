(AP) — Nigel Macauley kicked a 20-yard field goal with 15 seconds left, lifting North Carolina Central to a 27-24 comeback victory over Florida A&M on Saturday. \nAfter taking over at Florida A&M’s 47-yard line with 4:07 remaining, the Eagles used three runs apiece from Dorrel McClain and Ramone Simpson— and a 15-yard pass interference penalty_to get into chip-shot field goal range. \nThe Eagles (2-3, 1-1 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference) tied the game on their previous possession when Quinn Billerman capped off an eight-play drive with a 12-yard score to Armani Lanier. Billerman, who finished 6 of 8 for 47 yards, entered after Malcolm Bell was injured on a scramble earlier in the fourth quarter. \nCarson Royal finished 29 of 47 for 331 yards and two touchdowns for Florida A&M (0-6, 0-3), which has now dropped seven straight and 10 of 11.
