I’m proud that they were able to hold on.” \nAlso having huge nights for the Ships were Mallory Dixon (54 assists, 13 digs, two aces), Cassidy Mrotek (24 digs, 12 kills), Sarah Greene (20 digs, 12 kills) and Rayna Figueroa (21 digs). \nLincoln will play No. 2 Neenah Thursday at Oshkosh West in a sectional semifinal, having lost both meetings with the Rockets this season. \n“We played them tough twice,” Dixon said of her team. “We need everyone to step up or we need another performance like Henry’s tonight if we want to do well. There’s no cake walks at this point.” 67 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://htrne.ws/1N0eCcs TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:32:12.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
