If you can make the kids smile and distract them from what's going on and give them something to be able to talk about for a while, that's a success for us if we're able to do that. So it was fun for us and hopefully fun for the kids and for everyone involved.\"\nWith the hype that surrounded the Flames' acquisition of Hamilton in a draft-day swap with the Boston Bruins and the six-year, US$34.5-million deal that he signed a few days later, it's understandable that some folks in Calgary were expecting an on-ice superhero.\nYou won't hear the 22-year-old defenceman making excuses -- in fact, he's quick to reject them -- but his transition to a new squad, a new system and a new city remains very much a work in progress.\nWith just one point in seven outings so far, Hamilton is off to the slowest statistical start of his young career.\nThe 6-foot-5, 210-lb. rearguard owns a minus-6 rating so far and was split from partner Mark Giordano for Friday's home-ice victory over the Detroit Red Wings.\nHeading into Sunday's date with the New York Rangers in the Big Apple (5 p.m., Sportsnet West/Sportsnet 960 The Fan), his possession numbers are among the worst on the team.\n\"He's 22 years old,\" reminded Flames head coach Bob Hartley prior to Friday's clash with the Wings. \"That's always our first line, whenever we sit as a group -- he's 22. As much as he's played so many games for a 22-year-old defenceman in this league, he's not even close to his prime yet. So what does that mean? It's that he has a lot to offer, but he still has a lot to learn. And we can see this. We knew.\n\"Hey, we love to teach. Well ... we just got a new customer.\"\nGiordano struggled early in the season, but the Saddledome faithful were confident they would eventually see the guy who scored twice, collected three points and was a defensive stud in Friday's 3-2 OT triumph against the Wings.\nKris Russell stumbled out of the gates, too, but there was a sense of calm that the record-setting shot-blocker would turn it around.\nBut because there isn't the same familiarity with the guy wearing No. 27, you could hear the murmurs after Hamilton's mistakes ... Is this it? Is this the same guy that was so good for the Bruins?\n\"There's always expectations -- I got to Boston as a top-10 pick, and it's the same thing here,\" Hamilton reasoned after Friday's morning skate at the Saddledome. \"You want to do better every year and keep improving your game. Hopefully, I can keep doing that.\"\nHamilton logged a season-low 18:55 in Friday's victory over the Red Wings, but it was arguably his finest performance on Saddledome ice.\nIt could be -- should be, really -- something he can build on.\n\"Whenever you make a trade, you never know where the famous 'click' is going to happen,\" Hartley said. \"Sometimes, it's real quick. Sometimes, it's going to take a little time. But one thing is sure -- we're going to keep investing in him.\n\"A 6-foot-5 defenceman, 22 years old, right shot ... That's exactly why we did that trade, and we're going to keep pushing him.\"\nwes.gilbertson@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/SUNGilbertson\nCalgary Flames quick to remind that Dougie Hamilton has yet to reach his prime\nBy WES GILBERTSON , Calgary Sun First posted: Saturday, October 24, 2015 05:51 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 24, 2015 09:47 PM EDT\nA few days back, Dougie Hamilton and a hat-trick of Calgary Flames teammates suited up as the stars of The Avengers for a visit to the Alberta Children's Hospital.\nHamilton, apparently the guy who suggested the superhero get-ups, was Iron Man.\n\"There was a lot of shock -- I don't think the kids were really expecting it -- and a lot of blank faces, just kind of trying to figure out what was going on,\" Hamilton said. \"And there were some pretty good smiles, too.
