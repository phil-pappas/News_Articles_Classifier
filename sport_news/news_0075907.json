ONTARIO _ At times on Friday night, the rains reached near-torrential level at Wayne Central. That did not deter the Palmyra-Macedon Red Raiders from defeating the Eagles, 42-30. “The weather was pretty miserable, I'm not going to lie,” said Pal-Mac head coach Brad Patchett. “We did a nice job of protecting the ball and executing the snap which can be a challenge in cold weather. I know that Jayden (quarterback Jayden Colf) literally could not feel his hands, so passing was pretty difficult for him. Other than that, the field held up pretty well so it was really just a mental battle to block out the cold.” The victory in the Battle for the Axe was big on multiple levels. The Axe returned to Pal-Mac, which is always huge no matter the teams' records. The win also had postseason implications for the Red Raiders. “This win is huge for us,” Patchett said. “It guaranteed us a sectional birth which is obviously the goal for every season. The boys really deserved it, they have played so hard all season, despite the results. We let one slip away last week and played very well, so it was great to get a win. It was also a very memorable night for our kids, I told them that it would be a football memory that they could look back on for the rest of their lives.” With the miserable weather, the Red Raiders continued to utilize the wrecking crew that is Brandon Hawkins and Andrew Kujawski. Hawkins carried the ball 39 times for 333 yards and three touchdowns, while Kujawski pitched in with 18 carries for 132 yards and two touchdowns. It seemed like every time the Wayne defense started to key in on Hawkins, Kujawski would cut through the middle of the defensive line on a dive play. “Both backs played exceptional,” Patchett said. “Drew has been playing out of his mind the last two weeks on both sides of the ball the last two games, just a prime example of a senior leader stepping up and playing big down the stretch. We have to give a lot of credit to the offensive line, they are playing great and opening up some nice running lanes for our backs. Brandon has just been outstanding all season, he has developed into such a patient runner, really using his blockers well, and exploding once he finds a seam to run though.” While Pal-Mac utilized its ground game in the inclement weather with Colf unable to feel his hands, the Eagles were unafraid to put the ball in the hands of their star quarterback, Braeden Zenelovic. He finished the night with 16 completions on 24 attempts for 234 yards and three touchdowns. “Zenelovic is a very talented player,” Patchett said. “Wayne has a very good passing attack, it gave us fits most of the game. I think he is one of the best passing quarterbacks in the league, and their offensive line did a nice job giving him some time to throw... We were just fortunate to make some big defensive plays and force a couple of stops. It also helps when our offense was able to chew up that much game clock and keep Wayne's offense off the field.” A touchdown late in the fourth quarter by Wayne to bring the score within 12 made the game appear closer than it was. The Eagles defense struggled to contain the Pal-Mac running game, and the Red Raiders defense only allowed a few big plays the entire game while putting pressure on Zenelovic to manufacture big plays. While most of the attention was on the field for the rivalry game, the night was also about much more than the game. The week leading up to the game was all about raising funds to “Drop the Axe on children's cancer.” Both communities raised funds and both teams' cheerleaders took the the field at halftime to form a living ribbon at midfield. “A huge thank you to both communities in helping to raise over $3,000 for the Wayne County Children's Cancer Fund,” Patchett said. “A great idea that Wayne had, combining a fundraiser like that in with the game, and both communities stepped up and helped to raise money. A HUGE thank you on our end to Ellen Lennon who led the charge for the Pal-Mac side, as well as Coach Hill whose business class was able to raise over $1,500 for the cause.” By Jeremy Pike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:43:34.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
