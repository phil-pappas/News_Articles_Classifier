He won't require surgery but will miss roughly 4 weeks.\nâ€” Rand Getlin (@Rand_Getlin) October 16, 2015 The injury happened a few plays into the first quarter. It was Peat's second NFL start. He was replaced by veteran offensive lineman Tony Hills, who was recently signed by the team.\nThe Saints are already thin on the offensive line. Guard Tim Lelito and tackle Terron Armstead did not play against the Falcons.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
