With good pace and bounce on the wicket, Aniket Choudhary turned out to be other tormentor, picking up three wickets. The hosts ended the day at 743.\nBesides Chahar (560) and Aniket (326), 20-year old Nathu Singh, who celebrated his debut by snapping up a wicket, impressed with his medium pace. Gambhir's boys could have been bowled out before the lunch break, had the enthusiastic debutant not bowled two no-balls.\nShifting to Sikar from Jaipur proved a blessing as Nathu's subsequent performances helped him earn a zonal call, which eventually led to a stint at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore last year.\nOn Thursday, a number of the supporters travelled all the way from Sikar to cheer him.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:43:33.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
