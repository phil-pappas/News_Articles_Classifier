The Rams still have an excellent chance of making a bowl game, sitting at a 2-3 record with seven games to play, but coach Mike Bobo could use a signature win early in his tenure and none would be bigger than upsetting No. 25 Boise State. \nThe Broncos (4-1) enter Saturday's 5 p.m. kickoff at Hughes Stadium winners of their last three with two victories orchestrated by freshman quarterback Brett Rypien. If CSU can pull the upset (Boise State is favored by 15 points), it would put the Rams back in contention for a Mountain West championship. \nJoin Coloradoan sports columnist Matt L. Stephens and CSU reporter Kelly Lyell for a live chat Saturday beginning an hour before kickoff and lasting through the end of the game. Ask them your questions, get their analysis and join in the conversation. \nIf you're a mobile app user, please follow this link .
