(Photo: Jonathan Daniel, Getty Images) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Lions claimed offensive lineman Michael Ola off waivers from the San Diego Chargers Tuesday, according to the league’s official transaction wire.\nOla, who went undrafted in 2011, played 13 games with 12 starts for the Chicago Bears in 2014, spending time at both tackle and guard positions.\nAfter the Bears cut him in early September, the Chargers added him to the practice squad and had him active in Week 4 before waiving him Monday.\nThe 27-year-old Ola adds experienced depth for the Lions, who saw starting right tackle LaAdrian Waddle exit early in overtime with an injury. If Waddle is ailing, the Lions would start Cornelius Lucas at right tackle, and Ola has more experience than rookie Corey Robinson.\nTo make room for Ola, the Lions waived Taylor Boggs. Boggs was one of the stars of training camp, but with Manny Ramirez as the top backup interior lineman, the team decided it preferred Ola for extra depth along the offensive line.\nThe transaction wire also shows that the promotion of running back George Winn from the practice squad is official, and the Lions placed Zach Zenner on injured reserve.\nPractice squad offensive tackle Jordan Mills’ signing with the Buffalo Bills is official, too.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com\ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:18:49.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
