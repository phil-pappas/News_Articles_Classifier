Richardson has been Iowa State's quarterback forever now. His results have varied, but given the Cyclones ' underwhelming record, it's reasonable to say that ISU fans are eager for improvement at the QB position. \nMark Mangino and the rest of the coaching staff agrees with that sentiment. \n“I am not ready to throw Sam to the wayside,” offensive coordinator Mark Mangino said. “I think he has proven he can play and he will get his mojo back. I am confident of that this week. But we do know that we have Joel, who we do have a great deal of confidence in right now and we feel that he can play.” \nIf Richardson falters early against TCU, expect to see a lot of Lanning against the Horned Frogs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:53:21.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
