And that means that a simple playoff berth isn't something which interests him at this time.\n“(Jerry Buss) taught me for all these years, we’re always looking three to five years ahead. Right now, I’m not looking at this season…I don’t care about making the playoffs and getting eliminated in the playoffs. What I care about is getting the core players, because we want to get to the top, and the only way we can get to the top is to have the core players, get the free agents, have flexibility in our (salary) cap, and we’ll be there within three years. Not a problem. Boom.”\nThis is the right outlook to have. But to a certain segment of Lakers fans, it will undoubtedly come across as sending the wrong message.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/lakers/2015/10/22/jim-buss-lakers-chris-paul-mitch-kupchak-kobe-bryant-jeanie-buss/74293828/"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:26:37.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
