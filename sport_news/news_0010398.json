Why should I do so now?\" \nIcardi, who is also Inter's captain, scored 22 goals last season to finish at the top of the Serie A list along with Luca Toni. \nInter started the season with five straight wins but then lost to Fiorentina 4-1 and drew 1-1 at Sampdoria. A win on Sunday would put Inter 11 points clear of four-time defending champion Juventus. \n\"No one in Italy expected such a start for Juventus,\" Icardi said. \"They changed the spine of their team, (Andrea) Pirlo, (Carlos) Tevez and (Arturo) Vidal. But it's always best to weight things up at the end.\" \nSerie A leader Fiorentina will visit Napoli, and Lazio, which is three points behind Fiorentina and one below Inter, travels to Sassuolo. \nAlso Sunday, it's: Bologna vs. Palermo; Atalanta vs. Carpi; Frosinone vs. Sampdoria; Genoa vs. Chievo Verona; and Hellas Verona vs. Udinese. On Saturday, Roma hosts Empoli and AC Milan visits Torino. \nHere are some things to know about this weekend's Italian league matches: \nRESURGENT JUVE \nJuventus is slowly climbing up the Serie A table. \nThere has been a noticeable difference since the return of Sami Khedira from injury, with Juventus winning both the matches in which the German has played. However, Inter has twice as many points as Juventus. \n\"The match against Inter is definitely fundamental, especially for us as we have to try to get a result,\" Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli said. \"At the same time we're still at the beginning, it's still early days, but an eight-point advantage for Inter is big enough and if they get a result it would be a problem for us.\" \nInter hasn't beaten Juventus at San Siro since Jose Mourinho was in charge. \nPIPITA VS. PEPITO \nFiorentina is bubbling with confidence. \nThe Tuscan team moved into first place for the first time since 1999 with a victory over Inter and then moved two points clear with a 3-0 win over Atalanta. Fiorentina has scored 11 goals in its past three matches in all competitions and will be looking for more offensive output from Giuseppe Rossi. \n\"Pepito\" Rossi scored his first goal since returning from injury in Fiorentina's 4-0 win over Belenenses and the American-born Italy forward has used the international break to continue his recovery. \nFiorentina also faces a formidable attack as Napoli boasts Gonzalo \"Pipita\" Higuain, Lorenzo Insigne and Jose Callejon. \nHiguain and Insigne have both scored five league goals this season. \nDISGRUNTLED FANS \nIn a rare show of unity, hard-core fans from Roma and Lazio are planning to boycott the upcoming derby match. \nThe fans are disgruntled at new security measures which have split the Stadio Olimpico curve — the ends of the stadium where the ultras sit — and are planning to protest at the Nov. 8 match. \nIt is not the first time the fans have protested against the measures. Lazio supporters did so in the club's first home match against Bologna, as did their Roma counterparts in games against Barcelona, Sassuolo and Carpi. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:58:12.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
