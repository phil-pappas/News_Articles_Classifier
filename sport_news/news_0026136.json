Second-ranked Lydia Ko, No. 3 Stacy Lewis and 2014 winner Shanshan Feng tied for second.\n\"I was weirdly calm today,\" Korda said. \"I knew what I needed to do. I needed to take care of myself. If somebody was going to make a hot start, that's just the way it was going to be. I was going to continue playing my game.\"\nShe cried on the 18th green after her final putt.\n\"I think just struggling and being at your lowest and then feeling this and just going through these emotions, just incredible gratitude and just being so humbled by everything,\" Korda said. \"All the support that I've had, the people that have stuck with me this year, didn't stop believing in me even when I did a little bit. I think just all that hit me a little bit.\"\nThe long-hitter failed to qualify for the Solheim Cup team and was passed over as a captain's pick.\n\"Stepping back and looking at it, yeah, I was disappointed I wasn't on the team, but I know I played my way off the team and there was no chance that I could have helped,\" Korda said. \"I was really glad with the way that everything happened. I got to go to the Czech Republic for a couple days after Evian and sit down with my grandparents and my cousin. Honestly, the last three weeks have been such a great time in my life.\"\nKorda finished at 18-under 266 and earned $300,000. She opened with rounds of 69, 67 and 65 to take a two-stroke lead into the final day. The weekend 65s are her two best scores this year.\n\"Jess played unbelievable today. Nobody was going to beat her,\" Lewis said. \"When you have a two-shot lead and shoot 6 under, it's pretty hard to beat.\"\nKorda's father, Petr, won the 1998 Australian Open tennis tournament.\n\"I didn't actually get to talk to my dad,\" Korda said. \"It went straight to voicemail, but I did get a series of text messages.\"\nKo finished with a 66. The 18-year-old New Zealander was coming off consecutive victories in Canada and France, where she became the youngest major champion.\nFeng also had a 66, and Lewis shot 67.\n\"I think I did a lot of good stuff this week and a lot of good things to build on,\" Lewis said.\nThe event was the first of five straight in Asia. The LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship is next week in South Korea, followed by stops in Taiwan, China and Japan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:35:11.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
