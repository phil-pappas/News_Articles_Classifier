The Lady Bruins' lone in-state loss this year came against Knoxville Webb, a Division II school. \n\"The biggest thing for us was the competition and the pace of the game,\" Siegel coach Shawn Robinson said. \"That's what we wanted out of this game, to get ready for postseason.\" \nSiegel wraps up District 7-AAA play Thursday at home against Stewarts Creek. A Siegel sweep over the Lady Red Hawks would mark the second consecutive season that Siegel didn't lose a game in league play during the regular season. \nThe District 7-AAA tournament is Wednesday and Thursday at Stewarts Creek. \nTennessee commitment Asha Phillips had 10 kills and 18 digs to pace the Lady Stars (26-6). Leah Poarch added nine kills. Katelyn Lester had eight blocks, and Kayla Mize added for blocks with seven kills. Kristin Demonbreun had 26 assists and four aces. And Tennessee Tech commitment Liz Bossong recorded 18 digs. \nPhillips said there is a good competition against Brentwood since several from both teams play with each other in club ball. \n\"I love playing them,\" she said. \"I have friends on the team. It's just good competition. \n\"I have a couple of the girls on my travel team. We get to know each other really well.\" \nOf Siegel's six losses this season, only three are to in-state teams — all Williamson County foes. The Lady Stars have lost twice to Brentwood and once to Franklin. \nKaela Massey led Brentwood (41-3) with 19 kills and eight blocks. Teammate Garrett Joiner added 16 kills, 14 digs and five aces. Kamryn Carter recorded 15 digs and four blocks. And Anna Wilson dished out 27 assists. \nSiegel stormed back from a 24-15 deficit in Game 1 behind Demonbreun's eight straight service points. \n\"The girls and I are both upset that we didn't hold on to that lead that we had in the first game,\" Brentwood coach Barbara Campbell said. \"We let that slide. But sometimes momentum jumps away from you like that.\" \nBlackman 3, Eagleville 0: Tristyn Lozano had 16 kills to pace the Lady Blaze in the 25-17, 25-19, 25-18 win over the Lady Eagles. Paz Dozie Nnamah added seven kills and four blocks. \nMaddie Lee had eight kills and four blocks. Delaney King added 32 assists and seven digs. Tiffany Lyles had nine digs. \nReach Tom Kreager at 615-278-5168 and on Twitter @Kreager.
