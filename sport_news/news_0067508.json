As the ball bounced loose, Ward saw his shot deflected into the side netting.Mendes was the most likely to spark the game into life, with the winger carving out another chance for Forest, carrying the ball across the face of the box before rolling a simple pass to Nelson Oliveira, who stung Gerken's palms with a rising shot.When Ward delivered a cross from the left, Oliveira was appealing for a penalty, feeling that he had been held. Mendes was alert enough to play on, but saw his shot fizz wide.Forest began the second half brightly, but saw Ward fire wildly over when their pressure was rewarded with an opening.Freddie Sears forced a save from Dorus de Vries, who also had to be alert to push away a David McGoldrick effort, either side of a driven effort from Ward that tested Gerken.But, after Mendes had fired another effort over, it was Ipswich who were to take the lead, against the run of play.Forest failed to properly clear a Kevin Bru cross and, when the ball fell, Parr sent a looping finish over the head of De Vries and into the far corner.Oliveira sent a shot over from the edge of the box, but it was not until deep into injury time, after Jorge Grant had seen an effort cleared off the line by Piotr Malarczyk, that Trotter swept home the rebound for an equaliser.
