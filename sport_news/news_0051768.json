Despite it being Sunday, shops and other business establishments were open in most of the markets in the city, apparently to make up for the lost business days. Traffic also plied normally, though there was no rush of the Sunday shoppers as the mood appeared to have been dampened by the severe cold and the showers lashing the region since Saturday morning. The weather, as per forecasters, is expected to remain unchanged till Tuesday. The authorities have completely lifted the restriction from the areas in downtown Srinagar, which were imposed on October 22 following spontaneous protests over the death of a truck conductor, Zahid, from south Kashmir. Zahid, a truck conductor from Botengo village of Anantnag district in south Kashmir had succumbed in a Delhi hospital on October 18. He was injured along with two others during a petrol bomb attack in Udhampur on October 9. The authorities had, to prevent the protests and “further deterioration” of the law and order situation, imposed restriction in parts of Srinagar, including areas within Maisuma, Khanyar, Rainawari, Safakadal, Maharajgunj, Nowhatta police stations. The restrictions were, however, extended for two more days to foil planned joint sit-ins by separatists at the grand mosque in Srinagar on Friday and prevent Moharram mourning processions in the city on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:10:23.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
