(Susan Biddle/The Washington Post) \nU.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced Friday he’ll retire at the end of the year, but let’s hope the NBA can still find a spot for him to play during its annual all-star celebrity game. The guy has skills. \nDuncan, who captained the varsity squad at Harvard before playing professionally in Australia for five years, played in the star-studded NBA event in 2012, 2013 and 2014. \nIn 2014, Duncan racked up 20 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists to lead his team to victory, but he still failed to win over the public who voted entertainer Kevin Hart as the game’s MVP. But the pint-size comedian — who racked up just seven points, four assists and zero rebounds — couldn’t accept the award in good faith, so he ended up handing it over to Duncan. \n“I can’t take this one,” Hart said. “I have to be a humble loser. Arne Duncan, man, I gotta respectfully give you the MVP trophy. Arne Duncan — phenomenal player.” \nThe best part was probably the hug. Kevin Hart passed on his MVP trophy to US Secretary of State Arne Duncan last night.
