Mississippi State’s seventh-year coach is one of 16 coaches who make at least $4 million. \nLast year, Mullen ranked 27th nationally and 10th in SEC. He ranks 16th and eighth respectively in 2015. Vanderbilt didn't report its coaches' salaries. Arkansas' Bret Bielema is the only SEC West coach who makes less than Mullen. Bielema makes $3.96 million. \nAlabama’s Nick Saban is the highest paid coach in 2015 at $7.087 million. Only Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh joined Saban in the $7 million club. USA TODAY Sports \nSaban, Texas A&M’s Kevin Sumlin ($5 million), LSU’s Les Miles ($4.3 million), Ole Miss’ Hugh Freeze ($4.3 million), Auburn’s Gus Malzahn ($4.1 million) and Georgia’s Mark Richt ($4.1 million) all earn more than Mullen within the SEC.. \nMullen signed an extension in February through the 2018 season. It pays the coach on average $4.275 million per year. Mullen will earn $4 million this year, but will receive a raise next year. Details of the exact number weren’t released in the contract. \nMississippi State paid Mullen $3 million in 2014. \nMullen made $1.2 million in his first season at Mississippi State in 2009. \nMore from the report:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:50:09.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
