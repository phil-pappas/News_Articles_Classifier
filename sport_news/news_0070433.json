PETERSBURG - \nThis was not the way the Blue Jays wanted to finish their season. Not by a long shot. \nThat said, it’s safe to say that by Thursday, when the American League Division Series begins in Toronto against the Texas Rangers, the town’s first sniff of playoff baseball since Kim Campbell was prime minister, Whoomp (There It Is) was a hit song and Jurassic Park was filling theatres, these last two losses in Tampa will start to dissolve into the mist of irrelevance. \nUnfortunately, the details of Sunday’s 12-3 debacle at the hands of the Tampa Bay Rays were surely burned onto Mark Buehrle’s psyche as he tried to squeeze two final innings of out a superior 15-year career. His failure to do so was not his fault but he’ll never lay it on anyone but himself. That’s just who he is. \nAfter Buehrle had tossed 6.2 innings to get his 15th win of the season on Friday, it left him two innings shy of his annual goal of the 200-inning plateau he has reached in each of the previous 14 seasons as a starter in the big leagues. \nThe plan started going south on the third pitch of the game when Tampa leadoff man Brandon Guyer bounced a ball right at sure-handed second baseman Ryan Goins and he flat-out clanked it. Buehrle got a ground ball out, then loaded the bases with a couple of singles. That’s when Steven Souza hit a hump-backed liner that Edwin Encarnacion fumbled for another error. That opened the floodgates. \nThe end for Buehrle came 10 batters into the inning when Guyer singled to reach base. By that time the score was already 7-0 and the Rays had five hits. By inning’s end, after Mikie Mahtook hammered a long home run off Ryan Tepera, the Rays had scored nine times. Buehrle was charged with eight runs, not one of them earned. He finished his season at 198.2 innings, four outs short of his goal. \nComing on the heels of Saturday’s ninth-inning blown save by closer Roberto Osuna, it was hardly a fitting end for Toronto’s best season in more than two decades. \nThe Jays now have four days to rest and prepare for their best-of-five series against the Rangers, winners of the AL West Division. They locked that up Sunday with a 9-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels. That leaves the New York Yankees and the Houston Astros to battle it out in the AL wild Card game on Tuesday for the right to face the Kansas City Royals in the other AL Division Series.
