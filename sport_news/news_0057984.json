This season, it’s Conley’s enormous face, shielded in plastic, that looks down over the FedExForum plaza. This season, it’s Conley’s contract year, his return expected but not yet confirmed, his unlikely departure a certain subject of helpless speculation.\nLong the quiet leader of this core, the Booker T. guiding these MGs, Conley’s shift into the spotlight has been well-prepared: The mask, his playoff performance with it, the story around it, has lent him, for the first time really, some drama and color commensurate with his teammates. Conley now has an aura.\nIt’s become somewhat common over the past couple of seasons -- and not merely among Memphians -- to refer to Conley as a “Top 5 point guard” in the NBA. But it’s also still, even with Derrick Rose’s injury-fueled tumble and Tony Parker’s age-driven decline, just a little bit of a stretch. Conley is a mortal at a moment when the top talents at his position seem like something more. There’s an otherworldliness about Steph Curry’s shooting, Russell Westbrook’s rim-attacking savagery, Chris Paul’s cold, cruel control, John Wall’s locomotive size and speed, Kyrie Irving’s heaven-is-a-playground scoring.\nConley, by contrast, is perhaps the best of the rest, a testament to what more tangible talents can become when honed by years of work and incremental improvement. The strength of his game is its diversity. If Conley never overwhelms, he’s also the rare player who checks off every box at his position, who takes nothing off the table. He scores and distributes, shoots and finishes, operates an offense and spearheads a defense, leads and defers in appropriate, delicate balance.\nHis personal style is rooted in subtlety. A handle that manages to be tricky without being flashy. Defense that disrupts rather than stifles. Darting into the creases of a defense rather than exploding through them. Hesitation dribbles and ambidextrous scoops. Even Conley’s three-point signature -- the three-finger salute -- is built on a gesture of outward respect rather than inward celebration.\nBut the questions that have lingered throughout the Grit-and-Grind era remain: With Parker’s decline, Conley now seems to be the best point guard in the NBA’s best division, but can he also be the best perimeter player on a true contender? And does he have enough help to hold up seven months into an NBA season?\nAs he enters his age 28 season, and hurtles toward free agency, Conley’s trajectory is a mystery.\nIn 2013-2014, multiple “advanced” hoops metrics, such as “wins above replacement” and “real plus-minus,” actually did have Conley rated in the Top 5 at the position. But that wasn’t quite the case a year ago, when his assists ticked down, his turnovers ticked up and his defensive impact slid from the same all-NBA level.\nWas his battery of injuries the reason, or was 2013-2014 simply Conley’s career season? If so, will the Grizzlies, next summer, be looking at the prospect of bestowing a long-term max contract to a small guard at that point two-years removed from his peak?\nThat dip acknowledged, Conley’s game has roughly plateaued over the past three seasons. He doesn’t seem primed for the kind of mini-leap Gasol made last season, which resulted from a transformation of both body and on-court usage. A continuation on that plateau for several more seasons would be more than acceptable, and that’s probably (hopefully?) likely. But as a 6-foot-1 guard approaching 30, with plenty of wear and tear, a downward tilt might be more likely than an upward surge.\nAnd that wear and tear has to loom large in the Grizzlies’ anxiety closet, with the preseason likely renewing old concerns about the team’s backup point guard situation.\nConley is now the franchise leader in minutes played, but his durability is an issue that blooms each spring. Last April, he was limited by foot, ankle and wrist injuries in the playoffs even before a freak collision with C.J. McCollum fractured his face. The Grizzlies shouldn’t want Conley to log 82 games this season even if health allowed it. Last season’s 31.8 minutes per game was Conley’s lowest since 2008-2009; there’s a danger of that number creeping back up more from necessity than design.\nLast season, the Grizzlies went a surprising 8-4 in games that Conley missed, but Nick Calathes has returned overseas, Beno Udrih is 33 with active injury concerns and second-year third-stringer Russ Smith has been predictably spotty in the preseason.\nUdrih’s deadly mid-range pull-up can carry an offense for stretches, but his penchant to hunt shots rather than run offense seems to sometimes rankle teammates. He had ankle surgery over the summer and was shooting 1-10 in the preseason before tweaking the same ankle last week. While he’s been sitting since, Udrih is expected to be ready for the regular season, though.\nSmith got an extended look over the weekend, operating as a starter Friday night against the Thunder and as the primary back-up on Sunday against the Timberwolves, with his 56 minutes yielding “good and bad” as Dave Joerger put it after Friday’s game.\nSmith got buckets (10-21 shooting, 9-17 inside the arc) and picked pockets (6 steals), but also had more turnovers (9) than assists (8). Smith might be one of the quickest players in the league, which generates excitement, but the same stature that abets his speed can cause problems, as you could see on Sunday when he was taken advantage of on defensive switches and when going after 50-50 balls in the air rather than on the floor. As a playmaker, he has a tendency, as Joerger noted, to seek to set-up shooters even when the right pass may instead be to set-up someone else’s assist.\nSmith’s learning on the job, and while his speed and defensive peskiness could yield a greater upside down the road than what Udrih still has left, there’s no telling when or whether those skills will garner enough results to warrant a switch. As is, it’s hard to imagine Joerger being comfortable with Smith in a rotation role right now. At some point this season, Smith will have to be ready for that or the Grizzlies will need to be in the market for more point guard help.\nClip of the Week: Last Tuesday, as I was on the road back from a long-weekend trip, this happened at the Grizzlies’ open practice:\nThe @memgrizz held a mock 3-point shooting contest in front of fans and 7-foot-1 Marc Gasol hit 19 of 25. Say what? http://t.co/TBPbFFqu2U\n— ESPN (@espn) October 15, 2015\nIn the Pick-and-Pop the day before , I’d written this about the Grizzlies’ roster construction and three-point shooting:\nGiven that rare combination of non-shooters, unless your center shoots threes or you have Stephen Curry or vintage Ray Allen in your backcourt, you’re probably doomed to being a lackluster shooting team.\nI’ve been telling people for a couple of years that I expect a mid-to-late-30s Gasol, on the contract after this one, to be launching flat-footed threes a la Sam Perkins, so that performance doesn’t surprise me. And while it’s a novelty until further notice, I do think Gasol should start adding long-range looks, in small doses, to his regular repertoire. He shouldn’t be Channing Frye or Meyers Leonard; he’s too valuable in the low and high post and hasn’t demonstrated that level of long-range shooting. But I do believe Gasol could be a viable three-point threat, and with his most likely frontcourt partners providing little (Zach Randolph) to no (Brandan Wright) stretch, the occasional threat of Gasol from distance could add just a little more space to the team’s attack.\nElements of Style: It’s so often the little things that I love at NBA games, even of the early Sunday preseason variety. This happened. I imply no meaning to it, just a random, enjoyable bit of color:\nTony Allen knocks down a mid-range jumper in preseason, gives himself two pats on the behind. Matt Barnes smirks faintly from the bench.\n— Chris Herrington (@HerringtonNBA) October 18, 2015\nThere was also this, which I swear actually happened:\nNikola Pekovic isn't active, but I did see him playing volleyball (!?) with a (much smaller) Wolves employee in the hallway before the game.\n— Chris Herrington (@HerringtonNBA) October 18, 2015\nNotes on Youth: As pointed out earlier, the injury-necessitated absence of the Grizzlies’ past two first-round picks, Jarell Martin and Jordan Adams , from preseason action has been a bummer.\nBut while Russ Smith has been up-and-down in his audition, second-year forward JaMychal Green has been the development of the preseason for the Grizzlies. Green’s defense and rebounding stood out as soon as the games started, but he added some offense this weekend. His game-high 18 points against the Thunder on Friday night was the result of the kind of efficient opportunism (8-11 shooting) you love to see from defensive-oriented role players: Transition dunk, putback, catch-and-finish. But against the Wolves, all three of his baskets (also his total attempts) hinted at growth potential. He pump-faked in the corner and stepped confidently into a mid-range jumper. He knocked down a three-pointer from the wing. And he attacked a mismatch against forward Damjan Rudez, turning into him and bullying past the weaker defender for a lay-up.\nIf Courtney Lee weren’t still scorching nets, Green would be the Grizzlies' player of the preseason. Along the way, Green seems to have acquired something difficult to obtain for young players on playoff teams: The trust of his coach. He now seems a likely bet to open the season with a spot in the rotation.\nMeanwhile, the fortunes of fellow second-year forward Jarnell Stokes seem to be headed the other way, playing fewer, less effective and discouragingly foul-prone minutes. On Sunday, with every other under-contract Grizzlies player either sitting out or in a regular rotation role, Stokes played only six minutes of mop-up time.\nTwice this weekend -- after Friday’s game and before Sunday’s game -- Dave Joerger seemed to be stumping for journeyman veteran center Ryan Hollins to make the team. The Grizzlies already have a maximum 15 players under contract and any sober assessment of the roster would have to deem Stokes the most likely cut if the team wanted to free up a spot.\nHollins and Stokes are very different players: Stokes is a better rebounder despite being much shorter, is probably a better shooter despite that skill being very much in development and presumably has more capacity for growth.\nHollins is a finished product. A proven, reliable third-string-center type who provides a seven-foot frame around the rim defensively and a target above it offensively, where he’s helped himself by converting 14 of 16 shot attempts so far this preseason. With Marc Gasol as otherwise the only real center on the roster, there’s a case that Hollins represents a player type this team needs more than Stokes.\nBut I also feel like “Stokes or Hollins” mischaracterizes the real choice the Grizzlies face, which instead starts with this: “Stokes or not?”\nThe Grizzlies have to decide whether they think Jarnell Stokes is going to be a valuable NBA player. With JaMychal Green clearly passing him on the depth chart and Jarell Martin coming up behind him on a first-rounder’s contract, Stokes is now third on the team’s pecking order of “Under-25, Under 6’10” Power Forwards,” which is a pretty precarious place to be. (Even if Stokes may effectively be a center.) That presents some pretty steep downward pressure.\nOn the other hand, the Grizzlies need to exercise caution about discarding young players. There’s history here. DeMarre Carroll was jettisoned early on and will now be the highest-paid player on a projected playoff team. If he were still around, the team’s small forward situation would be cleared up. Greivis Vasquez was sent packing after his rookie season for driving his coach crazy, but if he were still around the team wouldn’t be as worried about its backup point guard situation. The youngest homegrown player of significance on this roster right now is Mike Conley. He’s entering his ninth season.\nWho’s to say that Jarnell Stokes -- or Russ Smith or Jordan Adams or Jarell Martin or even JaMychal Green -- has a future as an NBA rotation player? That’s what’s tricky about it. Based on what I’ve seen, I’ve grown skeptical about Stokes’ NBA future. He’s not a floor-stretcher or a rim-protector on a team that could use more of both, which means he needs to be pretty strong in other areas. The rebounding is there. And, offensively, I suspect Stokes is hurt by the eye test. Because so many of his shots get blocked, his misses are more discouraging than most, even if his actual success rate is pretty good. For comparison, check out the interior field-goal percentages and blocked rate comps among last year’s Grizzlies frontcourt players (small sample size caveats apply for the rooks, info from 82games.com ):\nPlayer Inside FG% % of attempts blocked Marc Gasol 63% 8% Zach Randolph 64% 10% Kosta Koufos 53% 7% Jon Leuer 67% 11% JaMychal Green 70% 9% Jarnell Stokes 62% 17% So, those blocked shots might look bad, but they’re also easy to overrate. A miss is, generally speaking, a miss. But if the Grizzlies come to believe that Stokes will remain a marginal NBA contributor, which I suspect may well be the case, then sacrificing his roster spot for something the team needs more has to be considered.\nThat could be a rim protector (Hollins). But it could also be a frontcourt three-point threat. Or another ball-handler. Or just an open roster spot to be filled later, when injuries or poor production clarifies the area of greatest need. Right now, I don’t really have a good feel for which way this might go.\nThe Jacob Riis Report: Notes on the past week’s in-town opposition.\nOklahoma City Thunder: All the core players for both teams sat in this one, but I don’t think the Grizzlies’ bench beating up the Thunder bench is necessarily preseason meaninglessness. I’m not a fan of how the Thunder’s roster has evolved around a championship-level-if-healthy core. Dion Waiters, in particularly, still seems like team karma kryptonite. But I did think Memphis-bred rookie Cameron Payne looked like a good get. Payne played with confidence and precision. I suspect he’ll push incumbent D.J. Augustin for the back-up point guard role at some point this season.\nMinnesota Timberwolves: I’m excited for this regular-season series. Kevin Garnett and Zach Randolph scrapping. Tony Allen and Marc Gasol bringing out the vet moves on Andrew Wiggins and Karl Anthony Towns. Vince Carter, Tayshaun Prince and Professor Andre Miller gathering before the game like old men having coffee at a diner. Lots of fun.\nJust a Proposal: A few weeks ago, I said I was done tilting at the windmills of the Grizzlies starting lineup with my occasional suggestion of changing, matchup-based combinations. But Jeff Green still looks better with bench units and Tony Allen was zipping around doing Tony Allen Things with the starters on Sunday and yet I still understand Dave Joerger’s desire for more size sometimes and so I now offer this last-ditch idea: Let Jeff Green settle in as the team’s sixth man and use the Freebird Rule among the trio of Courtney Lee, Tony Allen and Matt Barnes, with match-ups dictating the starting combo each night. Most of the time, that’ll mean Lee at the two and a choice between defense and shooting at the three, but on nights with a rare ball-dominant two guard and a brawny small forward (see: Rockets, Houston) maybe Allen-Barnes would get the call. Plus, you get to break ground by introducing the Freebird Rule to the NBA. Be an innovater.\nTweet of the Week: Some election-season Griz-reference throwback action from Our Man Dan Devine:\nWhen Bernie Sanders just said, “For example, do I think” and began delving into the content of the bill, I got a real Hubie Brown vibe.\n— Dan Devine (@YourManDevine) October 14, 2015", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/1007_masp_griz_wed03.JPG", "https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=%22freebird%20rule%22", "https://twitter.com/HerringtonNBA/status/655882893424660481", "http://media.jrn.com/images/1017_masp_griz_fri04.JPG", "https://twitter.com/memgrizz", "https://twitter.com/YourManDevine/status/654103003188760576", "https://twitter.com/espn/status/654800185000747008", "http://t.co/TBPbFFqu2U", "https://twitter.com/HerringtonNBA/status/655883970190536704"], "published": "2015-10-19T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:34:21.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
