Terry Swanson ran for 161 yards and a touchdown and Kareem Hunt had two scores in the No. 24 Rockets' 38-7 victory over Kent State on Saturday. \"We've got a lot of work to do,\" Toledo coach Matt Campbell said. \"I'm not going to be satisfied. My expectations for this group are really high. I feel like our potential, when we reach it, will have a chance to be very high, and we haven't reached our full potential yet. But that's OK.\" Toledo (5-0, 2-0 Mid-American) overcame a shaky start against the Golden Flashes (2-4, 1-1). The Rockets' Diontae Johnson took the opening kickoff 89 yards for an apparent score, but the play was nullified by a penalty. After a three-and-out, Toledo's fourth-down snap sailed through the end zone and Kent State recovered for its only points of the day. \"That's the worst of a really good situation,\" Toledo defensive end Trent Voss said. \"It's a little frustrating, but that's almost something that we laugh at. It's like, hey, shutout, we want that zero. But either way, if we get that victory, we're coming out happy.\" Toledo took over from there, and led 24-7 at the half. Swanson carried 16 times, while Hunt had 16 carries for 85 yards. Rockets quarterback Phillip Ely was 19 for 32 for 205 yards and two touchdowns. The Golden Flashes had 257 yards of offenses, converted 7 of 18 tries on third down and never advanced to the red zone. \"We didn't play our best after that (play),\" Kent State coach Paul Haynes said. \"Is our best good enough to beat Toledo? I don't know. But we could have played better, especially with all the penalties.\" Each team was whistled for nine penalties, costing Kent State 83 yards and Toledo 84. Campbell dismissed the Rockets' spot in the rankings. \"I could care less if we're ranked, I'll be honest with you,\" Campbell said. \"Those are things that are about after the season. That doesn't get you better, that doesn't win you football games.\" Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
