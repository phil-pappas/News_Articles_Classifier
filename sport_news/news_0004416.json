Freddie Cruz said in front of Green Springs High School at 3555 NW Seventh St. \nCruz said the students had just been released from school and were heading east on Seventh Street to a nearby Pollo Tropical for lunch. \nA black car was trying make a left on 35th Avenue when the vehicles collided, Cruz said. The van flipped and several other parked cars in the area were hit and damaged. \nThe driver of the car was taken to Ryder Trauma Center, where he later died.
