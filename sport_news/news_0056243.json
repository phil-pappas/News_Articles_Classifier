Dallas traded for Pachulia after DeAndre Jordan changed his mind in free agency and stayed with the Los Angeles Clippers. \nDalembert has career averages of 7.7 points and 7.8 rebounds in 13 seasons. \nThe Mavericks also waived Brandon Ashley, Jamil Wilson and Tu Holloway on Saturday, putting their roster one above the maximum of 15. Holloway signed with Dallas two days earlier and didn’t appear in the preseason. \nDallas opens the season Wednesday at Phoenix.
