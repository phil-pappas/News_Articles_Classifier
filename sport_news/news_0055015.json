Sources said the unrest would have wide ranging consequences for the state’s economy and hurt investor confidence. With the crisis in the farm sector, the state government is eager to restructure its economy and promote the manufacturing sector. The state government’s top brass is taking decisive steps to ensure the success of the summit. On the second day of the summit, a special session on “start-ups” would be held. Overall, there would be nine sessions, six on the first day and three on the second day. There would be sessions on manufacturing, health, agriculture, life sciences, aero-space and defence. A senior official said those who have confirmed their attendance were a 15-member delegation from China, 10-member delegation from Hungary, seven-member delegation from South Korea and industry representatives from Israel, France, US, UK, Netherlands, Singapore and other countries. He further said a 28-member delegation, including two Deputy Ministers, would also take part in the summit. He said representatives of RIL, Sun Pharma, Hero Motors, ITC, DLF, Fortis, Mohindra and Mohindra, Bajaj Group, Coke and Pepsi would also attend the event. However, experts said hosting investment summits was not enough. There was a need to do more on the political level. The state government’s first mission should be to build pressure on the Central Government to promote business and trade with Pakistan not only through the Wagah border, but also through Hussainiwala and Sadiq near Abohar. They said without promoting trade and business through the Wagah border, the state wouldn’t attract investment. Recently, Pakistan’s former foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri also said that if there were good relations between India and Pakistan, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and a part of Rajasthan would benefit immensely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:13:41.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
