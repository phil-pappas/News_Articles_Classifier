It is a world class facility, a great hotel and I think all the players will really enjoy playing the golf course. \n\"The Grove is a parkland course and it has some elevation changes. It is always presented in great condition. \n\"It has a really nice variety of some longer holes and some drivable par fours. I think it will also be a fun course for the spectators.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:15:03.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
