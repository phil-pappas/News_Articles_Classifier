He scored his first goal in the 4-2 defeat, and was the team’s strongest forechecker all evening.\nIt took just one shift for him to find the scoresheet, but it was on a penalty. Beleskey put a shoulder into Alexei Emelin as the Habs defenseman tried to flip the puck off the boards to clear the zone.\nBeleskey made solid body contact, but the referee whistled Beleskey for an illegal check to the head. Montreal scored while he was in the box.\n“I don’t even think Beleskey made contact with the player’s head, yet he got that called,” coach Claude Julien said.\nBeleskey agreed.\n“(The referee) said he thought I hit him in the head,” Beleskey said. “I’m pretty sure I didn’t, but they make mistakes too.”\nHowever, the early setback didn’t phase him, and Beleskey’s goal to make it 3-1 in the second period was a product of hard work. (Though not destined for any highlight reel.)\nWith Jeff Petry holding the puck below the Montreal goal line, Beleskey came barreling down and hit the defenseman, forcing an errant pass corralled by David Pastrnak. Pastrnak chipped the puck to David Krejci, and Krejci sent it quickly back to Beleskey near the goal line.\nWith no apparent shooting angle, Beleskey tried to feed the puck to Pastrnak in front of the net. Petry slid to block the pass, but kicked the centering attempt past goaltender Carey Price at 14:26.\n“It was a good forecheck by our line,” Beleskey said. “(Krejci) made a nice pass and I got a lucky bounce off a skate. It was nice to get that one out of the way.”\nThe Bruins have three even-strength goals in two games, all from Beleskey’s line.\n“It feels pretty good. We’re starting to find each other,” he said. “We’ve got to tighten up defensively, but I think the chemistry is pretty good.”\nKrejci has been at his most effective with a strong forechecker on his wing. While Beleskey is still searching for his first win as a Bruin, he’s already begun to fill that role.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:19:12.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
