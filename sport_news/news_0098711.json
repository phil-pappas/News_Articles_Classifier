She paid $3.80 to show.\nIreland-bred Mirage under Tyler Baze steadied sharply off the heels of Lucky Folie with a sixteenth of a mile to go. The stewards decided she lost a chance at a better position and moved her up to second.\n''The winner would have gone by me,'' said Hall of Famer Gary Stevens, aboard Lucky Folie. ''I had to stand up to help Tyler out. There wasn't a whole lot of room there to begin with.''\nView gallery In this photo provided by Benoit Photo, Stays in Vegas and jockey Alex Solis win the $100,000 Surfer … Stays in Vegas overtook Lucky Folie after drifting in late.\n''My filly, she went in toward the rail a tiny bit, but I corrected her right way,'' Solis said. ''I didn't think she touched anybody.''\nJakaby Jade, the 9-5 favorite, finished sixth in the 11-horse field. Jockey Rafael Bejarano said she lost her two left shoes during the race.\nThe victory, worth $60,000, increased Stays in Vegas' career earnings to $130,600, with three wins in four starts for co-owner and sports talk host Jim Rome.\n''She ran like the boss,'' Rome said, ''like a champ.''\nView gallery In this photo provided by Benoit Photo, Stays in Vegas and jockey Alex Solis win the $100,000 Surfer … In the $100,000 Zuma Beach Stakes, Dressed in Hermes won by a half-length.\nRidden by Stevens, Dressed in Hermes ran one mile on turf in 1:35.76 and paid $5.20, $3.20 and $2.80 as the 8-5 favorite.
