Barcelona are top on seven after beating BATE Borisov.\nLeverkusen shot out of the blocks and struck after just four minutes, sending Roma keeper Wojciech Szczesny the wrong way to score with a penalty, awarded for a handball by Vassilis Torosidis.\nThe Italians, with their backs to the wall after gathering only one point from their opening two group matches, initially struggled with the high-pressing Leverkusen but tested keeper Bernd Leno with Pjanic's 16th minute effort.\nThe hosts scored again, however, with Hernandez snatching his second goal from a pinpoint Hakan Calhanoglu pass.\nRoma's defence looked as shaky as in their 3-2 loss to BATE Borisov in their previous game, when they conceded three goals in the opening half hour, but De Rossi cut the deficit in the 29th, tipping the game instantly in Roma's favour.\nThe 32-year-old slotted in after a bad clearance from Leno and then slipped into the box to connect with a Pjanic free kick to equalise in the 38th with Leverkusen having inexplicably surrendered control of the game to the Italians.\nRoma picked up where they left off and a scintillating run by Gervinho required another good save from Leno but the keeper was helpless when Pjanic curled his free kick over the wall.\nTorosidis should have added another in the 70th but Spaniard Falque made amends in the 73rd, tapping in from a Gervinho assist before the late comeback from Leverkusen rescued a point for the Germans.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:18:43.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
