Babcock believed the injury wasn’t serious at the time, but has already had to slide in Mark Arcobello to centre James van Riemsdyk and Leo Komarov. \n“We’re a better team if Bozak’s in the lineup,” Babcock said. “He had his best game (in the 6-3 win over the Blue Jackets) before he was out. \n“I thought he was practising today. They (trainers) held him off one more day. Ideally he’ll be ready to go.” \nBabcock ran what he considered to be “the best practice of the year” Monday, though it’s gnawing at him and the Leafs that they’ve let a couple of points get away as part of their record of 1-3-1. A big part of that are early goals given up by Bernier in his three starts. That was the subject of a chat between coach and goalie on Monday after Bernier gave up two in a 39-second span in Pittsburgh, followed by him slamming the door on Sidney Crosby and Co. \n“Bernie would be the first to tell you he wants it to go better,” Bacock said. “We need him to be better, especially early in back-to-backs (when a team’s energy is sapped having to play catch-up). I’m going to delay that decision (between Bernier and James Reimer) one more day, You can’t get down two goals. He’s a big boy, he knows that, but you can’t spot the opposition two.” \nPressed on how he’ll handle any more inconsistency from Bernier, who had the same concerns in 2014-15, Babcock was not going to belabour the issue. \n“I wasn’t here last year. I have a small sample size. We talked about it today. I’m not a big believer in putting your head in the sand and ignoring what’s going on. I like to address it. \n“What I like about Bernie, he takes responsibility and works hard. When you have the physical capabilities he has (the slow starts) are the mental side and that’s everything until you get that looked after.” \nBernier, who’d no doubt like to play Saturday in Montreal if he gets only one start this week, is talking about adjusting his pre-game rituals. \n“Maybe change the routine ... you have to try a few things,” Bernier said. “As I said on Saturday, it’s mental, not physical. \n“I have to take some positives out of it. You don’t want to let in the last one in the last minute. I thought I played a pretty solid game after that.” \nBabcock ultimately believes the goaltending will get better as the Leafs fully embraces an identity and perfect his methods. \n”Our team getting better structurally is going to make it easier on our goalies and ideally help them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:03:13.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
