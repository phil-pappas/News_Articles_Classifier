Pendleton likes the way the defense has come on in the last couple of weeks and with talented players such as Kylie Hayes, Krysta Medearis, Kat Gries and Rhonda White on hand, Houston has a real chance to make some noise.\nTeam: White Station (24-14)\nCoach: Teresa Thomas\nPast state championships: none\nFirst match: Wednesday vs. Murfreesboro Siegel, 11 a.m. at MTSU\nKeys to success: The butterflies will undoubtedly be big for the Spartans, who are making their first state appearance since 1997 and will have a decided homecourt disadvantage against Siegel. White Station will rely heavily on Katie Thomas — the coach's daughter — and emerging talents Kaila Beckwith and Miyah Woodard. And when big points are needed, they have one of the best in town in senior Abigail Duncan, whose play this week will be vital.\nDivision 2-AA\nTeam: Briarcrest (42-4-1)\nCoach: Carla Anderton\nPast state championships: 1981, 1987, 1989, 1990, 2003\nFirst match: Wednesday vs. Nashville Father Ryan, 2 p.m. at Siegel High\nKeys to success: Just keep doing what they've done all year. The Saints enter on an 18-match winning streak and lost only once this year against a team from Tennessee (Harding on Aug. 22). Hannah Cox is a dynamo at libero while Callie Anderton — the coach's daughter — orchestrates the attack. Up front, the Saints are huge with freshmen Carsyn Starr and Alyiah Wells and Kendall Strand all at or over 6 feet.\nTeam: St. Agnes (21-14)\nCoach: Ryan Wallace\nPast state championships: 2012; 2013\nFirst match: Wednesday vs. Chattanooga Baylor, 12:30 p.m. at Siegel High\nKeys to success: The Stars are another squad with great senior leadership by setter Taylor Hasley, who has been one of the best players in town for the last three seasons. Her leadership will be crucial, as will her setting for kills-leaders Emma Sorrells and Stephanie Hochu. Constance Connolly, another battle-tested senior, anchors the defense.\nDivision 2-A\nTeam: Harding (37-6)\nCoach: Alyssa Hall\nPast state championships: 1992, 2002, 2007, 2008\nFirst match: Wednesday vs. St. Mary's, 11 a.m. at Siegel High\nKeys to success: Lauren Deaton and Antoinette Lewis are the big hitters up front, but Harding's success this year has been built on an all-around approach with contributions from the whole lineup. Setter Taylor Ferrante provides excellent service for Deaton and Lewis, while Rachel Hickman adds a steadying presence, along with her fair share of kills. Add in reliable Katie Grace Short and it makes for a formidable group that could go all the way.\nTeam: St. George's (22-10)\nCoach: Emmy McClain\nPast state championships: 2010, 2011\nFirst match: Wednesday vs. Knoxville Webb, 9:30 a.m. at Siegel High\nKeys to success: Good chemistry is one of the hallmarks of a good team, and the Gryphons seem to have that. McClain said veterans Sope Adeleye, Sophia Quesada and Sarah Thompson have done a great job of building team unity this year, while obviously playing at a high level. A pleasant surprise this year has been the rapid development of Annika Thompson, who has stepped into a key role as an a eighth-grader.\nTeam: St. Mary's (22-6)\nCoach: Kari Duncan\nPast state championships: none\nFirst match: Wednesday vs. Harding, 11 a.m. at Siegel High\nKeys to success: The Turkeys will be the underdogs in a strong field, but Duncan is optimistic her team can surprise, provided it sticks to the game plan and doesn't get intimidated on the big stage. St. Mary's was very solid on defense in the sub-state victory over Zion Christian, and outside hitters Carmen Freeman and Bebe Chancellor will have to come up big.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:31:31.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
