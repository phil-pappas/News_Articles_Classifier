I hope and pray that I will be able to repay you for having taught me magic for real.” This was not a Teacher’s Day message, but a birthday message from one of my former students. Yes, it was flattering to say the least and I allowed myself the luxury to bask in all its warmth for a few minutes. But then it got me thinking. What was the magic that he was referring to? I know for a fact that I am not an exception and I do what most teachers all over the world do. I am regular with my classes, try to be meticulous with my corrections and ensure that my syllabus is completed on time. What makes students remember their teachers long after they have left school? Surely, it is not the syllabus and the examinations! Looking back at my own childhood, I found the answer. I remembered my first housemistress, Mrs Rawal. I was to run the cross-country race, but on account of being underage, I had to run with the prep school girls. This meant that none of my batch mates would be there to watch and since the routine of the prep and senior school was different, there would be no chance of anyone cheering me on. Mrs Rawal called me at lunch, casually enquired about my race and wished me luck. As I turned the last bend towards the arch, I saw from the corner of my eye, a shoe… a few more steps and I could see the white salwar kameez. My heart skipped a beat and my pace increased of its own volition. Sitting on the parapet, her parasol in her hand, there was Mrs Rawal cheering me on like I had won the Olympic marathon. She had done magic. She had found time in an otherwise gruelling schedule to trudge down the hill to the finish line to cheer one of her girls. How can I ever forget her? At that moment, I felt loved, valued and special. I could have laid down my life for her. Yes, that was magic. Mrs Rawal did not do this for me because I was her blue-eyed girl, she did this because this was the thing to do. She would be there for everyone, no matter what. Besides being there, she was fair; another ingredient for magic. Fairness in both praise and reprimand is one thing that children recognise and respect. I finally understood the magic that my former student was referring to. I can only say that teachers like Mrs Rawal have inspired me to try and be like them and, in turn, I try to be there for my boys and girls. If I can touch their lives with a little of the same magic that touched mine, it will have been worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:03:56.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
