So to win three is taking some time to sink in.\"\nPeterson, a native of Rothschild, first shot skeet at age 10 under the tutelage of his father, Tom Peterson, and grandfather, M.L. Peterson.\n\"He could barely hold the gun up as the stock was way too long for a 10-year-old, but he never wanted to stop shooting,\" Tom Peterson said.\nAfter graduating from high school, Peterson enrolled at Milwaukee School of Engineering. He graduated from MSOE in 2012 with a mechanical engineering degree. He works as an engineer at Joy Global in Milwaukee and does most of his shooting at Waukesha Gun Club.\nWorld-class skeet shooting is a game of perfection.\n\"I really enjoy the mental part of the game,\" Peterson said. \"At this level, it's really a test of your focus and control.\"\nThe World Skeet Shooting Championships consists of 100 targets of doubles followed by 150 targets in 12-gauge and 100 targets in 20-, 28- and .410-gauges.\nPeterson won the doubles by hitting 100 of 100 targets, then winning a shoot-off over 13 competitors. He also hit every target in the five rounds of the shoot-off.\nHe shot 150 of 150 in 12-gauge, 99 of 100 in the 20-gauge and 100 of 100 in the 28- and .410-gauge.\nHis total of 449 of 450 in the combined scores of the 12-, 20-, 28- and .410-gauge earned him the High Overall Champion world title. His overall score of 549 of 550 took the High All Around Champion world title.\nThe last Wisconsin shooter to win a world skeet title was Mark Reichow, who won the doubles event in 1992.\nHow does someone get so skilled at breaking clay pigeons?\n\"Lots of practice and an unwillingness to not improve,\" said Peterson, who also holds 22 Wisconsin skeet titles.\nPeterson does not have a shooting coach. Each time he goes to the range, he sets a plan on what he wants to accomplish.\n\"I'm constantly working on the mental game, working on the small things,\" Peterson said. \"It's demanding, but also really enjoyable.\"\nPeterson tries to shoot twice a week from April through October, with at least 100 targets each time. He also schedules shoots under the lights, because many national and world events are held at night.\nPeterson said his goals over the next year are similar to this year's: keep a 99% average or higher.\nHe expects to give another run at the world championships in 2016. But while it would be great to win more world titles, he knows it's a very fine line between first place and losing in a shoot-off.\n\"One small slip or loss of concentration can be the difference,\" Peterson said. \"I'll just try to keep improving and let the results fall where they will.\"\nFor now, Peterson will resume shooting with buddies at Waukesha Gun Club.\n\"I've already been getting a hard time from some of them,\" Peterson said. \"But no, I'm not too good for them. I'm looking forward to getting back into the routine.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/336724831/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-25T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:46:55.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
