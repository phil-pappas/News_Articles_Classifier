There were times he got beat badly around the edge, and it led to a couple dangerous throws from quarterback Joel Stave. \nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Benzschawel gave up three quarterback hits and three hurries, while being beaten on four other pass rushes that didn’t lead to a pressure. \nStill, he’ll only get better with experience, and he looks like the best the Badgers have at the position. \n— Something else I noticed along the offensive line: Dan Voltz missing a number of blocks. \nHere are a couple that stood out, both of which contributed to negative running plays: \nFor what it’s worth, Pro Football Focus actually ranks Voltz 142nd out of 148 NCAA centers in its overall Prod Grade. I’m not yet sure how Pro Football Focus calculates its numbers — I’m working on finding out — but this is something to keep an eye on if Voltz returns from his arm/wrist injury this week. \n— UW still has a great defense. \nOutside of a few uncharacteristic big plays, it played almost as well as it did the previous week. \nThe go-ahead, 55-yard touchdown came down to D’Cota Dixon missing a tackle that would have stopped the play after 2 yards and Michael Caputo surprisingly taking a slightly poor angle at the fullback. \nThe 41-yard touchdown given up by Sojourn Shelton was mostly a fantastic play by the receiver, and it also had a lot to do with the Badgers not getting pressure on a play in which they blitzed five and kept a QB spy near the line of scrimmage. \nUW did get get to the quarterback in this game, though. \nThe Badgers pressured Nebraska’s Tommy Armstrong on 30 percent of his drop backs, per Pro Football Focus. Some of those gave UW interception opportunities that just weren’t converted. On others, Armstrong did a fantastic job of escaping. \n— Nebraska tried to pick on cornerback Derrick Tindal during a stretch in the second half. \nI don’t blame them. He had some rough patches early in the season, particularly against Miami (Ohio), when six of the seven completions he allowed in man coverage went for 10-plus yards. \nBut Tindal stepped up to the challenge Saturday. He was thrown at five times, didn’t allow a reception and defended two passes. \nHe was called for pass interference on a pass 47 yards downfield early in the third quarter, but I thought it was probably the wrong call and he defended the play exceptionally well. You can decide for yourself: \n— Joel Stave played well in this game, and not just in the fourth quarter. \nHis day did involve some dangerous misses that could have resulted into interceptions, but he also made quite a few anticipation throws that were really impressive. \nWatching this game a second time, the thing that sticks out is that Stave didn’t have many easy throws to make, which was not the case last week against Iowa. \nReceivers weren’t getting good separation, and by my count, the Badgers ended up with seven drops in this game. \n— Tight end Troy Fumagalli wasn’t exactly open enough to warrant 12 targets, but it looks like the Badgers believe he can use his body on short passing routes to out-muscle defenders. He did so fairly often Saturday and caught six passes for 60 yards and a touchdown. I think we’ll continue to see plenty of targets go his way while Austin Traylor (arm) is out. \n— Dare Ogunbowale forced six missed tackles on his 18 carries, according to Pro Football Focus. He also picked up 57 of his 117 yards after contact.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:51:43.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
