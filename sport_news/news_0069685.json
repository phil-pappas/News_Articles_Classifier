(AP) - Montgomery County is about halfway to its goal of raising enough money to build a grand entrance to a new veterans cemetery under construction in Kilmichael.\nWTVA TV reports ( http://bit.ly/1kz2zb5 ) county supervisors said this week the Mississippi Development Authority and the Mississippi Department of Transportation each have provided $150,000 grants for the project.\nThat's $300,000 of the estimated $542,000 needed for the project.\nAlmost $7 million in federal money is paying for the majority of the new cemetery but the entrance was not included.\nLocal leaders also are raising money for a tower that will play music during funerals and other ceremonies.\nThe cemetery is expected to host its first funeral in about 18 months.\nInformation from: WTVA-TV, http://www.wtva.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
