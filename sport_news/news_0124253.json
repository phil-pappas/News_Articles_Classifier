Kershaw gets the nod for Game 4 1 / 1 Back to Gallery New York\nClayton Kershaw 's next chance to end his playoff skid will come on short rest.\nWith only three days between outings, Kershaw is scheduled to start for the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 4 of their NL Division Series against the New York Mets . The reigning NL MVP and three-time Cy Young Award winner was chosen Monday over fellow left-hander Alex Wood .\n\"Do you have to explain that one? He's pretty good,\" manager Don Mattingly said about Kershaw. \"No matter if we're down 2-1 or up 2-1, we feel like he's the right guy.\"\nThe best-of-five series was tied 1-all going into Game 3 on Monday night at Citi Field. Game 4 is Tuesday night in New York, and rookie left-hander Steven Matz is lined up to pitch for the Mets.\nKershaw started the series opener last Friday and threw 113 pitches in 62/3 innings. He struck out 11 but gave up a home run to Daniel Murphy and was beaten 3-1 by Jacob deGrom.\nKershaw matched a season high with four walks and was charged with three runs and four hits. He fell to 1-6 with a 4.99 ERA in 12 career postseason games, including nine starts, with his fifth straight playoff defeat.\nDuring that postseason losing streak, the longest in Dodgers history, he has received only eight runs of support in 291/3 innings.\n\"I appreciate the confidence that Donnie has, the confidence in me to do it,\" Kershaw said. \"It's a good feeling to know your manager wants you out there. Makes you want to prove him right, for sure.\"\nKershaw pitched well in the playoffs on three days' rest the past two years, going 0-1 with a 2.25 ERA in two starts. He struck out 15 and walked three.\nNationals: Former bench coach Randy Knorr is senior assistant to the general manager for player development.
