Knock on wood, it's not a good omen to talk about T-shirts the day before the race.\n\"But eventually, hopefully, we are going to wear them.\"\nMercedes have won 11 of 14 races so far, with eight one-two finishes, and staff can expect significant bonuses again this season.\n\"It would be a very big achievement,\" said Wolff. \"It would be the second title, as Mercedes the constructors' championship makes us proud. We add another little bit of history to the 1950s and 2014.\n\"And nobody can take that away from us.\n\"Obviously, the drivers' championship is the one that is very relevant to all the fans and that is then the next box we have to tick and that is not a given that it is going to be easy.\"\nHamilton is 48 points clear of Rosberg and looking likely at the moment to wrap up his third crown with a race or two to spare.\nHowever, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel is still mathematically a threat, 59 points adrift of the Briton after winning three races.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:43:08.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
