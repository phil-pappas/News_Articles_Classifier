In the NBA, there are few more qualified to do that than Sports Illustrated’s Chris Mannix.\nMannix gave his preview of the Bulls Sunday night just two days before the start of the regular season. As has been the case in each of the last few years, Mannix said the Buls future is dependent on their health.\nHowever, unlike previous years, it’s not all on Derrick Rose.\nMannix said the Bulls depth in almost every position gives them arguably the best roster in the Eastern Conference. That’s contingent, however, on keeping the likes of Rose, Jimmy Butler, Pau Gasol, Joakim Noah and Mike Dunleavy healthy.\nIf that can happen then the Bulls don’t need Rose to be the MVP version of himself. They do, however, need Rose to be able to learn and run the offense as the point guard.\nThis has been roughly the same scouting report on the Bulls since Rose’s initial knee injury. It also seems to be the prevailing thought throughout the NBA.\nLast week the annual NBA GM survey was released. The Bulls were voted to finish second in the East mostly because of the strength of their overall team.", "external_links": ["http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&isUI=1", "http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash", "http://www.si.com/nba/video/2015/10/20/fast-breaks-chicago-bulls-team-preview", "http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"], "published": "2015-10-26T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:48:51.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
