(AP) â€” Louisville coach Rick Pitino vows he \"will not resign and let you down\" as investigations continue into an escort's book allegations that former Cardinals staffer Andre McGee hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players.\nIn a season preview Thursday on his web site, the Hall of Fame coach apologized to fans for having to \"endure the pain\" of allegations by Katina Powell that McGee paid strippers to perform 22 shows from 2010-14 at the players' dormitory.\nPitino, 63, has denied knowledge of the activities described in Powell's book and said Thursday, \"someday I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years but that time is not now. I do not fight these accusations by others but rather turn the other cheek.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
