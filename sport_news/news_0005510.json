Marquise Piton, Noah Spence and company sacked Brown five times and recorded 10 tackles-for-loss in the win. \nEKU aired it out early and often. On the 3rd-and-8 on the Colonels’ first drive of the game, Coney rolled out and found freshman slot receiver Arien Beasley for a 70-yard touchdown strike. \nAfter Eastern forced a quick punt, Coney and the Colonels were at it again, marching 81 yards down the field and scoring on a three-yard fade route to junior wideout Devin Borders in the corner of the end zone. \nEKU tacked on a 37-yard field goal by Lucas Williams, but Tennessee Tech responded with a six-play, 64-yard drive, capped by a 15-yard touchdown run by Ladarius Vanlier at the end of the first quarter. \nThe Colonels just kept coming, though. On its next possession, Eastern rode a 30-yard run by freshman tailback Ethan Thomas to the Tech 41 and then scored when Coney found senior tight end Ben Madon in the flats for a three-yard touchdown. \nAfter another forced punt, Eastern drove to the Tech 28-yard line and got a 45-yard field goal by Williams to make it 27-7 in favor of the Colonels with 8:52 to play in the second quarter. \nOn its next possession, EKU used a pair of big catches by Beasley to march down the field and then scored on a three-yard strike from Coney to junior running back Bryan Green. \nOn the Colonels’ next drive, it was sophomore running back Adam Lane’s time to get involved. Lane busted a 35-yard run to get EKU to the Tech two-yard line and then punched it in from two yards out to make it 41-7 with 3:46 left in the first half. \nTTU got a 32-yard field goal just before half, as EKU went into the locker room at the break up 41-10. \nThe Colonels cruised in the second half, scoring only on a late nine-yard pass from Coney to Mobley to make it 48-17. \nEKU returns to action next Saturday, October 17, at Southeast Missouri. Kickoff is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. ET.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:17:44.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
