And it wasn't nearly enough.\nThe Penguins lost 4-1 to the Stars at Consol Energy Center, two weeks after Niemi and the Stars shut them out on opening night in Dallas. The loss drops the Penguins to 3-4 this season, and improves Dallas to 6-1.\nThe Penguins welcomed back veteran winger Pascal Dupuis from injury Thursday, came out strong, but trailed by two goals by 15:05 of the first period.\nDefenseman Johnny Oduya lifted a shot from the point through traffic at 10:55 that looked as though Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury didn't even see until it was too late.\nThen John Klingberg snapped a wrist shot past Fleury on the power play at 15:05 after stickhandling around Dupuis to make it 2-0.\nJason Spezza capitalized on a turnover by David Perron in the second period, and skated in on Fleury to make it 3-0 at 5:07.\nNick Bonino broke Niemi's shutout bid at 11:20 of the second, working to gain the puck down low before wrapping around the front and burying a shot high.\nBut that was it for the Penguins.\nThe Stars scored their final goal when Mattias Janmark jammed in a rebound at 13:02 of the second to make it 4-1.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742070&h=Penguins+lose+to+Dallas%2C+4%2D1", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742070", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742070&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:11:39.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
