Boston shut Ramirez down for the season with a little more than a week to go, citing persistent discomfort in his right shoulder. A converted shortstop who was a disaster as a left fielder will report to spring training having not played first base in a major-league game. Penciling Ramirez into first base next season would represent at least as much of a gamble as was penciling him into left field this season. The problem is that Ramirez is owed $66 million over the next three seasons and has barely hit at a level that befits a shortstop, let alone a left fielder or first baseman. His track record -- a career .500 slugging percentage before he came to Boston -- suggests he’ll revert to form next season. To move Ramirez, however, Dombrowski and the Red Sox would have to absorb a significant portion of that money. Even then, if Ramirez does not have a clear defensive role, his potential destinations are limited. That’s why Boston officials must profess to believe what they cannot really believe -- that Ramirez will be their first baseman next season. The presence of Travis Shaw perhaps allows the Red Sox to roll the dice into next season, but they can’t allow Ramirez to undermine next season the way he did this one -- even if they’re suggesting a willingness to do so. As the New York Mets open their National League Division Series, it brings to mind the evening at Fenway Park when John Farrell professed confidence in Yoenis Cespedes as a center fielder. Ramirez had just come aboard as the team’s starting left fielder, taking over the position Cespedes had been acquired from Oakland four months earlier to play. “To his credit, he’s just eager to do whatever is needed by this team,” Red Sox manager John Farrell said then. “We’re excited to have his versatility at our disposal at those other two spots. Whether it’s center or right, we’ll determine that once we get to camp.” Page 2 of 2 - Less than three weeks later, the Red Sox traded Cespedes to Detroit for Rick Porcello -- just the sort of trade the signing of Ramirez had made inevitable. Cespedes wound up with the Mets, and has become a cult hero as he has helped propel them to an improbable playoff berth. At the time, Farrell had to play it coy. He knew Ramirez had pushed Cespedes from his natural position. He couldn’t know for sure that the Red Sox would find a trade partner for Cespedes. He had to speak publicly as though he expected Cespedes to be part of his team the following April. That brings us back to Ramirez, the player for whom Cespedes was shoved aside. Ramirez began taking ground balls at first base in Chicago in late August, just two days before his final game of the season. He continued to take ground balls and make throws for almost a month before the plug was pulled on his season. Ramirez looked adequate in his drills at first base. The problem is that drills can’t replicate game situations -- as Alex Rodriguez learned in mid-April, in the lone game he tried to play at first base this season . If Ramirez couldn’t learn how to chase fly balls in left field, it’s difficult to fathom how he could learn to scoop wayward throws out of the dirt while keeping his feet aligned properly. It’s even more difficult to fathom the Red Sox going into next season taking the same gamble at first base that they did this season in left field -- especially after a second half that saw Ramirez hit no home runs in 114 plate appearances. If no team believes Ramirez can bounce back at the plate and show some level of capability at first base, the Red Sox might be forced into a difficult decision. They might need to acquire a first baseman they know can handle the position defensively. They might need to acquire a first baseman with a longer track record of hitting in the major leagues than Shaw. If no team believes Ramirez is worth acquiring, the Red Sox might have to bow to the strict laws of economics and treat Ramirez as a sunk cost -- no matter what they’re saying now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:16:40.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
