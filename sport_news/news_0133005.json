Sometimes they listen to me, sometimes they don’t.” \nOn Thursday, for example, Russo said she gave struggling Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom a pep talk. \n“He was kind of losing because they were hitting him,” she said. “I said, ‘C’mon deGrom, you can get out of that.’ Sure enough, he got out of it. He listened to me.” \nRusso’s 77-year-old son, Gerry, said it’s a wonder deGrom didn’t hear his mom. \nFAMOUS SAD METS FANS CELEBRATE METS NLDS VICTORY TOGETHER AT DODGERS STADIUM \n“I can hear her all the way in the other wing of the house,” said the younger Russo, who lives in a sprawling Bedford, N.Y. mansion. “Usually she’s saying things like, ‘Get him out of there! He can’t hit! Or, he’s a terrible batter.’” \nBorn in Pennsylvania and raised in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Russo has been a Mets fans all 53 years of the team’s existence. \nFor the first half of her life, Russo rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Then they broke her heart. \n“When they went to California, I washed my hands of them,” she said. “They gave up on Brooklyn.” \nSo when the Mets arrived, she bought season tickets. “I have no use for the Yankees,” she said. \nRusso said she stuck by the Mets through thick and thin and went to as many games as she could, including every home game of the 1986 World Series which the Mets won. \n“All the years I’ve been ribbed about them, but I’m still a Mets fan,” she said. “I take them good and take them bad but they are still my favorite.” \nRusso will be back in her favorite chair on Saturday — and she’ll be talking. \n“I pray to God that the Mets win,” she said. “The Cubs are a good team too.” \nRusso isn’t just a longtime Mets fan, she’s a lifelong reader of The Daily News, which appeared on newsstands in 1919 — when she was four. \n“I get the News every day,” said Russo, who started reading the News in 1936.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:41:59.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
