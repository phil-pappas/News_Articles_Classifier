Christian Santos got the visitors on the scoreboard in the 62nd minute, but it was too little too late against a superior Brazil. \nOliviera's 74th-minute header put things to bed for good, as Brazil prepare for their next qualifier, a Nov. 13 match in which the Selecao will visit Argentina. \nArgentina remain without a win in their qualifying campaign after drawing a blank in Paraguay. \nGerardo Martino's men followed up their 2-0 home defeat to Ecuador last week with a 0-0 draw in Asuncion on their travels. \nA performance that would have left Martino's players frustrated was almost salvaged by a late winner but substitute Paulo Dybala, on his debut, skied a late chance. \nArgentina were without injured star forwards Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero, and it showed. \nEcuador ran their qualifying record to two wins in two tries, following up a Thursday win against Argentina with a win over Bolivia by the same 2-0 scoreline. \nThe Ecuadorians left it late as Miller Bolanos didn't get them on the scoresheet until the 81st minute. Felipe Caicedo added a second goal deep into stoppage time to give his team a little cushion as the clock ran down. \nThe match was played in a torrential downpour and the pitch was covered in water for most of the match. \nIn another matchup of regional powers, Uruguay got the better of Colombia with a 3-0 win in Centenario Stadium. \nDiego Godin opened the scoring for the home team in the 34th, heading home a cross in from Carlos Sanchez following a corner kick. \nDiego Rolan and Abel Hernandez added second half goals, as Uruguay eased to the victory. \nInjured James Rodriguez did not play for Colombia, while Juan Cuadrado was sent off in the 93rd minute, but by then the match was in hand for Uruguay. \nHosts Peru will likely feel hard done after suffering a 4-3 defeat at the hands of defending Copa America champions Chile. \nA Jefferson Farfan double was cancelled out by a pair of braces from Chile's Alexis Sanchez and Eduardo Vargas. \nSanchez got Chile on the board first in the seventh, minute only for Peru to score twice and then Chile to do the same to make it 3-2 at halftime. \nChile went up 4-2 with a second from Vargas, making the injury time goal from Paolo Guerrero meaningless. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
