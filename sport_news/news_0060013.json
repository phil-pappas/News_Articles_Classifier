But another unbeaten season? \n“Of course I think any time you don't lose any games you've got to be happy about it,” said Townsend. “Is it unexpected? Absolutely, it was a surprise. But that's just more of a credit to the kids and their work ethic, I think, honestly. They work extremely hard, like a lot of teams do, but they've been overachieving on an everyday basis. We play good defense and we try to keep teams off the scoreboard best we can.” \nIn the team's 5-0 win Oct. 19 at Wasgatt Field, the Mariners were led on offense by Makenna Brooks (2 goals, assist), Casey Pine (goal), Abby Veilleux (goal), Kelsey Brooks (goal, assist), Bri Dugan (assist) and Lily McVetty (assist). \nOceanside held a 20-2 edge in shots, 11-0 advantage in corner kicks and 2-1 edge in direct kicks. \nKalyn Grover made two saves in goal for the Mariners, while Cori Shooter made 17 saves in net for the Lions. \nTownsend said one of the keys for his teams is “putting up as many goose eggs for the other team as you can” and the Mariners have done just that this season. \nOceanside has outscored opponents 39-3 — an average of 2.78 goals per game — with 12 shutouts. \nTownsend conceded it has not been easy as they “don't blow a lot of teams out” and by the same token, “win a lot of close games.” \n“I hope that's going to prepare us for the heavy competition we're going to see come playoff time,” he said.” \nThe Mariners conceded a goal in an 8-1 win at Belfast Sept. 8 and battled host Waterville to a 2-2 double-overtime tie Oct. 1. \nThe Mariners have outscored opponents 20-0 at home this season and held foes scoreless for six straight games early in the campaign, and ended the year having not conceded a goal for five straight matches. \nAnd Oceanside, as the region's top seed, will have home field throughout the Class B North playoffs. \n“I tell the girls, 'Just get out there and find a way,' ” the veteran coach said. “Find a way to get it done. And they do. They've got just enough talent and desire to get the job done.” \nThe Mariners also have a chance for revenge, of sorts, on Wednesday, Oct. 21 when they will face Waterville for the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference Class B championship at Lincoln Academy in Newcastle. The game kicks off at 7 p.m. \nTownsend said he's “not too hung up on that game tomorrow” against Waterville as he plans to keep his players rested and loose. \n“I just want to get out of there safely and look forward to next Tuesday [for our first regional quarterfinal playoff game],” he said. \nThe Mariners lost one of its best defenders, Becca Boggs, to a torn anterior cruciate ligament midseason, while defenders Lauren Hatch and Emma Lee also have been banged up the past week. \nTownsend said that Haylee Witham and Meredith Mitchell have “done a fine job” playing for Hatch and Lee as the defense has not missed a beat. The veteran coach added he has used talented veteran forward Makenna Brooks sparingly the past few weeks in an effort to keep her rested for the postseason. \nOffensively, the Mariners rely on Makenna Brooks, cousin to identical twin sisters Kelsey and Jillian Brooks, all of whom have pumped in multiple goals this season. Casey Pine also has been an offensive threat, as has freshman Hope Butler, who scored both goals in the team's 2-2 tie with Waterville earlier this season. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Oceanside (12-0-2, 176.9133 points) is first in the 18-team region. The top 12 teams qualify for the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:08:30.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
