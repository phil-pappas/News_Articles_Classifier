(Photo: KVUE) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAUSTIN – The Texas Longhorns stuck to the ground game for the majority of a drenching Saturday, racking up 373 total yards on the Kansas State Wildcats in a 23-9 victory. \nSenior kicker Nick Rose split the uprights with a 28-yard kick with 6:19 left in the first quarter to start the scoring for the Longhorns. \nJunior running back Tyrone Swoopes had a cumulative 50 yards on the day, which included three touchdown runs in the first half and a third with less than two minutes in the game. \nKansas State found the end zone near the end of the first half on Joe Hubener’s seven-yard pass to freshman receiver Dominique Heath. \nThe wet conditions made handling the ball difficult for both teams. A poor snap in the first half ended with UT missing a PAT, and a snap going over punter Michael Dickson’s head in the fourth quarter. Dickson was able to kick the ball away. \nThe Longhorns move to 3-4 on the 2015 season. Texas will travel to Ames, Iowa to play the Iowa State Cyclones on Halloween.  //kvue.tv/1S31inC TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:48:02.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
