Niesen couldn't say when the examination of whether there is a case will be concluded. \nBid committee leader Franz Beckenbauer says he never had money given to anyone to buy votes. \nNiersbach, who was also a senior member of the German bid committee, said that Germany ran an honest bid. \n\"We conducted the bid with honest means, and ultimately decided (the contest) with honest means for us, for Germany, for German football on July 6, 2000 in Zurich,\" Niersbach said at an event at the German Football Museum in Dortmund. \nA federation panel is investigating the case, as well as an \"internationally respected\" law firm, but Niersbach could not say how long the probe would last. \n\"We would all prefer that it would be concluded as quickly as possible,\" he said. \n\"But the main allegation ... the slush fund, we deny categorically. It's wrong,\" Niersbach said. \nGerman Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, who is also responsible for sports, said he was counting on the DFB leadership to clear up what happened quickly. \n\"They have questions of their own regarding this sum, what it was used for,\" de Maiziere told N24 television. \"But I have no grounds based on facts to doubt what Mr. Niersbach, Mr. Beckenbauer and others are saying.\" \nInternational Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said he was expecting \"a comprehensive and swift explanation of the facts.\" \nBach, who was on the supervisory board of the 2006 World Cup organizing committee, said in a statement the board had \"no indications at all of any irregularities of this kind\" at the time. \nGermany's interior minister at the time, Otto Schily, said it was FIFA, the embattled world governing body of football, which should explain what happened to the money. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:32:53.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
