Georgia Tech stings Florida State in stunner \nFlorida State had been playing with fire for so long. It earned a reputation last year as the talented underachiever that still somehow went 13-0 before losing the Rose Bowl, pulling off comebacks and close wins on nearly a weekly basis. The winning continued this year, even with Jameis Winston and most of the offensive line gone. The Noles won ugly, 14-0, in their first ACC game against Boston College, they beat Wake Forest 24-16 and they beat Miami 29-24. And just when they put together a great second half to roll past Louisville after a slow start, one of the craziest possible losses found them a week later, delivering their first regular season loss since November 2012. \nThe Noles lost 22-16 when Georgia Tech, which had dropped five straight games, blocked Roberto Aguayo's 56-yard game-winning field goal attempt with six seconds left, and defensive back Lance Austin picked up the ball and ran it back 78 yards the other way for a touchdown, with no time left on the clock. Just like Alabama thought against Auburn in 2013, there seemed to be two possibilities when Florida State lined up for a long field goal: win or go to overtime. Instead, a third wild card inserted itself into the mix. Not only did Georgia Tech block it, but it had the athletes to out-run the Seminoles' field goal team, pulling off a stunning miracle finish that finally saw Florida State stumble in a close game. \nEverett Golson, who was turnover-prone at Notre Dame, finally threw his first interception of the year. The offense stalled, with zero points in the second half. Georgia Tech finally woke up out of its five-game funk. And now Florida State has a blemish on its regular season record for the first time in nearly three years. \nTo make matters worse, it came on a day in which Clemson destroyed Miami 58-0, the worst loss in the Hurricanes' history. Ordinarily, Florida State would love to see such things happen to Miami. On Saturday, though, Clemson remained undefeated and took control of the ACC. Everything still will likely come down to the Seminoles' Nov. 7 visit to Death Valley, but based on what we've seen lately, it's clear that Clemson boasts one of the nation's best teams, and is the ACC's best hope for a playoff bid. \nFlorida State's loss damages the ACC's overall playoff hopes -- having two undefeated teams at this point is certainly better than one -- if the Seminoles can upset the Tigers, but for now Clemson can feel confident, while Florida State faces something new for most of its players: Preparing to bounce back a week after a loss (they host Syracuse), which, in this case, was one of the biggest gut punches in recent memory. 2. Stanford is the best team in the Pac-12 \nIt's appeared this way for a few weeks now, but it was confirmed when USC finally took down previously unbeaten No. 3 Utah on Saturday night in Los Angeles. \nUtah had been having an excellent season, but it was also riding unsustainable turnover luck, with neither its offense or defense actually ranking particularly high nationally. Utes quarterback Travis Wilson threw four interceptions, and USC took advantage on its way to a 42-24 win that muted talk about Utah being a top playoff contender. \nAfter that happened, Stanford rather easily dispatched Washington 34-14, behind yet another huge game from tailback Christian McCaffrey. McCaffrey ran 23 times for 109 yards and a touchdown, caught five passes for 112 yards and a touchdown and returned three kicks for 79 yards. He was the centerpiece of another solid outing for Stanford against a stout Washington defense, and the Stanford defense had no problem overwhelming a Washington offense that played without starting quarterback Jake Browning. \nStanford has dominated its Pac-12 schedule, getting off to a 5-0 start with the closest margin of victory behind a 41-31 win over USC. The offense continues to click, making the opening loss at Northwestern look like an anomaly, with McCaffrey jumping onto the Heisman radar. \nThe Cardinal have tough games left -- starting next week, at a surprising 5-2 Washington State -- but, even with that 16-6 loss to Northwestern, they are the Pac-12's best hope for a playoff bid and clearly the conference's most complete team. They'd be obvious favorites to beat Utah in the Pac-12 title game. They just might need to run the table to get themselves -- and the Pac-12 -- into the playoff. 3. Ole Miss can still be a thorn in Alabama's side \nAfter a 38-10 loss to Florida and a 37-24 loss to Memphis, Ole Miss appeared to be in danger of letting all memories of the 43-37 win at Alabama fade away. On Saturday, though, the Rebels got the win they needed to reverse course and at least keep themselves in the SEC title race. The Rebels defense -- which is still missing safety Tony Conner and also played without star tackle Robert Nkemdiche -- dominated Texas A&M, holding the Aggies without a touchdown as Kyle Allen completed only 12 of 34 passes for 88 yards before getting pulled. \nThe Rebels actually turned the ball over four times, but Texas A&M committed three turnovers and couldn't capitalize on Ole Miss' mistakes. Ole Miss out-gained A&M 471 to 192, and the Aggies' season is quickly looking a lot like last year: Impressive 5-0 start with what looks like a good nonconference win, plus an OT win over Arkansas, followed by a midseason nosedive. Ole Miss still has just one loss in the SEC, on the road to a good Florida team. The Memphis loss stings, but the Rebels technically control their own destiny in the SEC West. LSU is the division's lone unbeaten, and the Tigers must visit Oxford on Nov. 21, while Ole Miss is tied with Alabama in the loss column but holds the tiebreaker. Ole Miss' other three games -- at Auburn, Arkansas, at Mississippi State -- aren't pushovers, but the Rebels can't totally be dismissed from the race after what they did to the Aggies defensively. \nAlabama stayed alive on Saturday by winning its ninth straight against rival Tennessee, 19-14, thanks to a late Derrick Henry touchdown and a forced fumble on the Vols' final possession, while LSU quietly beat Western Kentucky 48-20 in the rain, with Leonard Fournette rushing for 150 yards. LSU has an off week, then has to play two of the following three weeks on the road against Alabama and Ole Miss, the two games that will shape the SEC race and have a significant impact on the playoff picture. 4. Seth Russell's injury may alter the Big 12 race \nEven Baylor's unimpressive performances are relatively easy wins. On a rainy day in Waco, No. 2 Baylor beat Iowa State 45-27, but after jumping out to a 35-0 lead, the Bears went on a rare drought of nearly 33 minutes without scoring. Iowa State threatened to make a game of it, but the Bears scored 10 points in the fourth quarter and won relatively comfortably. \nThe problem, however, is the standout quarterback Seth Russell got hurt during that fourth quarter and could be out indefinitely. Russell fractured a bone in his neck, the team announced Saturday evening , putting his status in doubt going forward, with more news hopefully to come in the next few days. He was replaced late by touted freshman QB Jarrett Stidham, who has been nearly flawless in mop-up duty this season and threw a touchdown to Corey Coleman on his one pass upon replacing Russell against the Cyclones. \nStidham is talented, and Baylor has not had much of a problem replacing quarterbacks under Briles. Still, Russell has been fantastic in his first year as starter, leading the nation in passer rating, for the top-ranked scoring offense, as Baylor takes aim at the playoff bid it was denied last year. The injury comes heading into a bye week, so the timing works in the team's favor, but if it's Stidham's turn, he'll quickly have to be prepared. Baylor's final five games include Kansas State, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, TCU and Texas. Oklahoma State and TCU are both still undefeated, while Oklahoma has responded to its Texas loss by beating Kansas State 56-0 and Texas Tech 63-27. \nBaylor is the most complete team in the Big 12, but Russell's injury throws uncertainty in the mix for a team that has been so dominant since the season started. 5. Barrett settles in as Ohio State's starting QB \nThanks in large part to J.T. Barrett, Ohio State just won two ABC prime-time games in a row by a total score of 87-17, doing exactly what everyone expected the top-ranked Buckeyes to do against a relatively weak schedule. Last week, Barrett sparked the Buckeyes after a rough start against Penn State, leading them to a 38-10 win. This week, Barrett finally started instead of Cardale Jones. While Ohio State again didn't get off to a fast start, it ended up destroying Rutgers 49-7, moving to a perfect 8-0 entering a bye week. \nBarrett shined as the point guard in the offense. He completed 14 of 18 passes for 223 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, as he finally got a chance to settle into a rhythm as a passer, even if he had only 18 attempts. On the ground, he ran 13 times for 101 yards and two touchdowns, again forming a great one-two punch with Ezekiel Elliott, who piled up 142 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries. \nDoing this against Rutgers doesn't prove much, but this is what the No. 1 team is supposed to do to Rutgers. As the Buckeyes head toward November, they've finally looked like that national championship contender they're supposed to be, over the last seven quarters or so, and the Nov. 21 game vs. Michigan State -- who rode a huge fourth quarter to a 52-26 win over Indiana -- is now looking as big as everyone had hoped, before the Buckeyes' crucial showdown with Jim Harbaugh and Michigan. We've always known that Ohio State is the most talented team in the country. Now it's finally showing it. \n* * *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:12:46.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
