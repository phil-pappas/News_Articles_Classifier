Here are this week's rankings, with each team's overall record, next opponent and a comment. Sponsored by \nLast week: Beat Colorado State, 41-10 \nThis week: at Utah State \nComment: Boise State gets its first real test since a 35-24 loss to BYU on Sept. 12. Since then, it's been routs of Idaho State, Virginia, Hawaii and Colorado State to the tune of a 204-24 scoring advantage (Virginia should have been a test but the Broncos destroyed them). Boise State has whipped Utah State over the years, too, with a 31.1-point win margin per game in the last 10 matchups between the schools. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Beat Fresno State, 56-14 \nThis week: vs. Boise State \nComment: Utah State has righted the ship after a rough start to the season. A win over Boise State would make the Mountain Division race a lot more interesting. It would give the Aggies essentially a two-game lead over the Broncos when you include the head-to-head tiebreaker, but Boise State is playing like the Broncos of 2006-12 right now. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Beat Wyoming, 31-17 \nThis week: at Colorado State \nComment: I'm still not 100 percent sold on Air Force given who it has beaten, but the Falcons are one of only three teams in the conference with a winning record and took a double-digit win over my No. 4 team (SJSU), so it has to be in the top three. A win at Colorado State would cement the Falcons as an upper-echelon MW team. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Beat UNLV, 33-27 (OT) \nThis week: vs. San Diego State \nComment: The winner of the SJSU-SDSU game is the team to beat in the West Division. SJSU is at home and if it wants to show it's a team to be reckoned with it has to defend home field and win this game. In a league that is short on capable quarterbacks, SJSU has two in Joey Gray and Kenny Potter. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Beat Hawaii, 28-14 \nThis week: at San Jose State \nComment: As I wrote two weeks ago, when SDSU was 1-3 and looked horrible, \"Don't count the Aztecs out of the West Division race.\" And a win this week over SJSU would put SDSU in a great position - 3-0 in league with two road wins - and firmly make the Aztecs the team to beat in the division. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Lost to Boise State, 41-10 \nThis week: vs. Air Force \nComment: The backend of Colorado State's schedule is extremely soft but the Rams could use a win here to have a little margin for error in its quest for a third straight bowl berth. Air Force has won eight of the last nine games in this series, so this rivalry hasn't been too friendly to the Rams. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Beat to SJSU, 33-27 (OT) \nThis week: at Fresno State \nComment: UNLV lost a golden opportunity when it fell to SJSU at home last week, but the good news is the Rebels are competitive against solid teams. That's rare for this program. A six-point favorite at Fresno State this week, the Rebels look for back-to-back road wins for the first time since 2013. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Beat New Mexico, 35-17 \nThis week: vs. Wyoming \nComment: Nevada did a nice job of responding from a tough loss to UNLV and now heads to the road, where it is 5-2 over the last seven games. The Wolf Pack can't trip up against winless Wyoming if it wants to win the West Division. Nevada will once again ride RBs Don Jackson and James Butler, who are the only two teammates in the FBS to average at least 94 rushing yards per game in 2015. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Lost to SDSU, 28-14 \nThis week: at New Mexico \nComment: It might be time for Hawaii to cut the cord on QB Max Wittek, who has hit only 44.9 percent of his passes with five touchdowns, eight interceptions and a 22.3 QBR rating, which is one of the worst in the nation. Wittek is a one-read quarterback who struggles if you take his first look. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Lost to Nevada, 35-17 \nThis week: vs. Hawaii \nComment: You have to wonder if New Mexico's improvement is a bit of a mirage. The Lobos' three wins this year are against Wyoming, New Mexico State and Mississippi Valley State, which are a combined 0-17, with five of those losses coming to FCS schools. Not exactly a marque win in the mix. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Lost to Utah State, 56-14 \nThis week: vs. UNLV \nComment: Honestly, Fresno State deserves the bottom spot. This is how bad things are: The Bulldogs are a six-point underdog at home against UNLV. This from a team that was in the Top 25 two years ago. Coach Tim DeRuyter makes the most of any head coach in the MW ($1,457,745 last year). His contract runs through 2018, so his job is safe, but he has to get this thing turned around quickly. Mountain West rankings \nLast week: Lost to Air Force, 31-17 \nThis week: vs. Nevada \nComment: If Wyoming wants to win a game in October, it better win this week. The Cowboys go on the road to Boise State (that will be as ugly as the Broncos want to make it) and then to Utah State (also ugly) after that. A loss this week and Wyoming will be winless as it enters the final month of the season.
