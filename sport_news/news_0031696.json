Police say the man was being ejected from the game and resisted the officer’s attempts to escort him from PNC Park. \nElizabeth Pittinger directs the city’s Citizen Police Review Board and says it appears the officer “escalated” the situation “like a rocket.” \nBut police union president Howard McQuillan says the officer acted appropriately because the fan refused to follow instructions. \nThe fan was handcuffed but not criminally charged. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:45:33.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
