I want to find out that these players are good enough to be in the squad.” \nEngland are in next year’s finals in France as group winners ahead of Switzerland and victory over Lithuania will make them only the sixth nation to complete Euro qualifying with a perfect record. \nCarrick and Rooney did not play at Wembley due to respective groin and ankle injuries but Hart, Cahill and Milner played as Theo Walcott and Raheem Sterling secured a ninth qualifying win. \nStoke City’s Butland, 22, has only played for England once in a 2-1 friendly win over Italy at Wembley in 2012. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:11:00.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
