Karr scored 5 touchdowns and ran for 158 yards on 17 carries in the first half. Buy Now Leeanna Ellis \nArlington's Jake Vogt hauls in a pass from Andy Theiler to score in the second quarter against DC West on Friday. Leeanna Ellis \nArlington's Zach O'Flaherty runs for additional yardage in the second half against DC West on Friday. \nVALLEY -- Garris Karr and the Arlington Eagles put on an offensive clinic Friday against DC West as the Eagles beat the Falcons 44-13. \nKarr, a junior running back, carried the ball 17 times for 158 yards and five touchdowns -- all in the first half. \nArlington coach Steven Gubbels attributed the win to staying the course. \n\"Each week, I think we have a had a better practice than the last week,\" Gubbels said. \"We're still focused on getting better, which has been the same theme we always talk about and it showed tonight.\" \nThe Eagles defense held the Falcons to 3-and-out on its first series and Karr blocked a punt to give Arlington the ball on the 25-yard line. \nA few plays later, Karr scampered into the end zone for a 9-yard touchdown run to give the Eagles the early 6-0 lead. \nKarr added scoring runs of 38 and 1 yards in the first quarter. He added his fourth touchdown on a 5-yard run following an Eagle fumble recovery. Karr's fifth score with 7:01 remaining in the second quarter gave Arlington a 31-0 lead. \nThe Eagles found their passing game worked against the Falcons as well. \nQuarterback Andy Theiler found sophomore Jake Vogt for a 20-yard touchdown pass with 4:24 left in the first half. \nArlington's defense came up big with several fumble recoveries and interceptions, including one by Sam Plugge, who ran it back for a 41-yard touchdown to give the Eagles a 44-0 lead at halftime. \nThe large lead early gave Arlington the opportunity to give some of the younger players some varsity time on the field. \n\"It was a great opportunity, not only to get our younger guys in a varsity game, but also for our older guys on the sideline. We talked at halftime about how they were going to coach them up.\" \nArlington will play at home next Friday against Fort Calhoun, an opponent Gubbels knows will be tough. \n\"We're going to have to bring our 'A' game because I know they will,\" Gubbels said. \"We'll just work hard this week and put it out on the field on Friday.\" \nArlington 44, DC West 13 \nArlington 18 26 0 0 -- 44 \nDC West 0 0 0 13 -- 13 \nA -- Garris Karr 9-yard run (run failed) \nA -- Karr 38-yard run (pass failed) \nA -- Karr 1-yard run (run fails) \nA -- Karr 5-yard run (Nick Gaffney kick) \nA -- Karr 3-yard run (kick failed) \nA -- Jake Vogt 20-yard pass from Andy Theiler (Gaffney kick) \nA -- Sam Plugge 41-yard interception return (kick failed) \nDCW -- Trevin Derr 27-yard run (Tyler Heston kick) \nDCW -- Nolan Weiss 3-yard run (kick failed) Ã—", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:30:56.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
