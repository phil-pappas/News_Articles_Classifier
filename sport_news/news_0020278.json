We'll see what happens. I know I've got to be smart about it. I've got to be able to defend myself. We're just going to take it day by day.\"\nRoethlisberger went down in the game Sept. 27 at St. Louis with a sprained MCL and bone bruise in his left knee. Surgery wasn't needed, but doctors predicted Roethlisberger would miss 4-6 weeks. The game at Kansas City will be four weeks after his injury.\nRoethlisberger returned to practice last week on a limited basis, mostly throwing passes in seven-on-seven drills.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739832&h=Roethlisberger+plans+to+practice+and+did+not+rule+out+playing+against+Kansas+City", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739832&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739832"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:38:06.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
