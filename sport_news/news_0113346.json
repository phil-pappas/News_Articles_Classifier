The RedHawks check into play ranked 14th in the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine Poll after dropping out of last week’s poll while moving up to 15th from 18th in this week’s USCHO.com poll. Miami is one of six National Collegiate Hockey Conference teams that are ranked in both major polls. Omaha tops the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll while sitting second in the USCHO.com rankings while North Dakota is ranked inversely (No. 1 in USCHO.com, No. 2 in USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine) to that. Other NCHC teams in the rankings are No. 5/5 Minnesota Duluth, No. 6/6 Denver and No. 9/10 St. Cloud State. Western Michigan was also receiving votes in both polls. This week’s schedule sees Miami head out to Canton, N.Y. to take on No. 17/RV St. Lawrence.
