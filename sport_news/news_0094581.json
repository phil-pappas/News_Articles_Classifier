Islanders goaltender Jaroslav Halak will miss his fourth straight game Thursday night against Nashville because of an upper-body injury.\nBackup Thomas Greiss will fill in again and make his third start of the season.\nHalak has been skating early with the Isles’ goaltending coaches over the past week, and he did so again Thursday morning. His undisclosed injury continues to improve, according to coach Jack Capuano.\n“Jaro’s progressing along real well,” Capuano said. “So hopefully good news ahead on that front.”\nGreiss has filled in nicely so far this season for Halak, anchoring the Isles in a 4-2 win over Winnipeg on Monday while making 32 saves in a 3-2 overtime loss to the Blackhawks in the season opener last Friday night.\nJean-Francois Berube — who the Islanders claimed off waivers from the Kings — started the second game of the season, a 4-1 loss at Chicago.\n“Obviously, guys want to play. The more you play, the more confidence you build in yourself. So he’s played well for us. He wants to get in there,” Capuano said of Greiss. “It’s unfortunate what happened to Jaro, but at the same time, it gives Berube and Greiss an opportunity to get in there and play some hockey.”\nBruce Bennett/Getty Images Thomas Greiss will make his third start in goal for the Islanders vs. the Predators. * * *\nThe Islanders and 39-year-old forward Eric Boulton agreed to terms on a one-year contract Tuesday. Boulton scored two goals in 10 games with the Isles last season.\n“What goes maybe for some people unnoticed is his leadership in the locker room and his character,” Capuano said of the 14-year NHL veteran. “He’s a team guy all the way, and there’s certain games throughout the year that we’re going to need a guy like Eric Boulton in the lineup. So he knows his role and responsibility.”\n* * *\nCapuano said defenseman Thomas Hickey, who suffered a relatively serious upper-body injury in the preseason, has been skating but still doesn’t have a timeline for a return.\n“We just want to make sure that he’s 100 percent,” Capuano said.\nRelated Stories Wayne Gretzky's best goals Islanders get power play going, beat Jets for first win Rangers out to improve shorthanded unit Tags: jaroslav halak , thomas greiss , eric boulton", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:40:13.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
