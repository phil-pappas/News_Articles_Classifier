Friday night's contest against Houston didn't make it any better. \nNo. 24 Houston scored on its first play from scrimmage and Tulane's offense could never get going as the Cougars rolled to a 42-7 victory at Yulman Stadium. \nQuarterback Devin Powell finished 11-of-28 passing for 88 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions as Tulane's starting quarterback. Houston outgained the Green Wave 461-262. \nThe Cougars were the second consecutive undefeated opponent for the Green Wave. Tulane travels to play at Navy (4-1) and Memphis (5-0) in the next two weeks. \nHouston couldn't have started the game off any better on offense as Greg Ward hit Chance Allen with a 49-yard pass for a touchdown. Allen beat Tulane cornerback Parry Nickerson who fell down around the 30-yard line, giving Ward an easier pass. \nTulane's defense held for the remainder of the quarter but the offense sputtered, going 0-of-4 on third-down conversions. \nOn the first play of the second quarter, Houston struck again on a 12-yard run by Ward to push the lead to 14-0. \nHouston was stopped on third and 4 from the Tulane 37 on the drive but the Cougars were also called for holding on the play. Tulane coach Curtis Johnson decided to accept the penalty instead of sending the Cougars to a fourth down. \nWard's pass incomplete on third and 14 but, Tulane linebacker Nico Marley was called for roughing the passer for hitting the quarterback \"too high\" although he didn't appear to make contact with Ward's helmet at any time. \nFollowing Ward's touchdown, the Green Wave offense was stopped again on the ensuing drive but Tulane used a fake punt to get deep into Houston territory. \nRob Kelley rushed for 43 yards off the left side of the punt formation down to the Houston 3-yard line. Sophomore running back Dontrell Hilliard punched it in on the next play to cut the lead to 14-7. \nHowever, the Cougars offense continued moving after that while Tulane's did not. \nHouston scored on a 5-yard run from Ward and then a 15-yard run by Demarcus Ayers to take a 28-7 lead into halftime. The lead could have been even more but Tulane linebacker Nico Marley stepped in front of a Ward pass late in the second quarter as the Cougars were looking to put more points on the board. \nThe Cougars added a pair of touchdowns in the third quarter on Ward's third rushing touchdown – a 2-yarder – and then Ayers broke through on a 73-yard punt return for a touchdown with 10 seconds left in the third quarter to put Houston up 42-7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:57:03.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
