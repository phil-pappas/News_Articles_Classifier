Some have broken with a strategy of selling the same models worldwide and are creating China-only vehicles.\nAutomakers are stepping up investment despite an unexpectedly sharp downturn in sales this year. In July, General Motors Co. announced a $5 billion initiative with its main Chinese partner to develop vehicles to be sold in China, Brazil, India and Mexico.\nAuto sales in China declined in August for a third straight month, contracting by 3.4 percent from a year earlier to 1.4 million vehicles. Ford's August sales declined by 3 percent to 79,608, while year-to-date sales were off 1 percent at just over 700,000.\nDemand has been hurt by congestion in Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities that has made car ownership less attractive and by official efforts to curb traffic and smog by limiting the number of new vehicle registrations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:20:20.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
