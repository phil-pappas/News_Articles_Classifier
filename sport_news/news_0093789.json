Silicon Valley Bank, Jazz Pharmaceuticals and ABC7 have each signed on as Celebration Sponsors, along with Riemer & Braunstein as a Reflections Sponsor and VITAS Healthcare and Wells Fargo as Star Supporters. The Light The Night Walks across the country have helped LLS invest important funds for breakthrough research and provide access to life-saving treatments for blood cancer patients.\n\"We are beyond grateful to all of our sponsors for their generous contributions to LLS,\" said Courtney Atchley , Light The Night Campaign Manager. \"Their support helps LLS fund critical research efforts and provide assistance to the families in our community dealing with a blood cancer diagnosis. Our sponsors are truly enabling LLS to save lives not someday, but today.\"\nThe Light The Night Walk is LLS's annual non-competitive fundraising walk, which pays tribute and brings hope to people battling blood cancers. Leading up to the walk, friends, families and co-workers form fundraising teams and millions of consumers around the country help by donating at partnering retail outlets. These efforts culminate in inspirational and memorable evening walks in nearly 200 communities across North America each fall.\nDuring the walks, participants carry illuminated lanterns – white for survivors, red for supporters and gold in memory of loved ones lost to cancer. Anyone big, small, young or old can shine a light on the importance of finding cures and ensuring access to treatments for blood cancer patients. This year, the Peninsula-Palo Alto Light The Night Walk will be held on Saturday, October 17 at 5 p.m. P.T. , at City Hall Plaza in Palo Alto, Calif.\nThrough its efforts, LLS has invested more than $1 billion in cutting-edge research to advance therapies. Thanks to research, survival rates for patients with many blood cancers have doubled, tripled and even quadrupled since the early 1960s. Yet, despite these advances, about one third of patients with blood cancer still do not survive even five years after their diagnosis. The efforts of Light The Night participants are helping LLS to improve survival rates and create a world full of cancer survivors.\nTo form a Light The Night team or to learn more, please call The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Silicon Valley & Monterey Bay Area Chapter at 408-490-2666 or visit www.lightthenight.org/gba .\nAbout The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\nThe Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ® (LLS) is the world's largest voluntary health agency dedicated to blood cancer.
