(Associated Press) Comments \nSyracuse, N.Y. — San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich was named the next head coach of the USA Basketball men's national team on Friday and will replace Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski after the 2016 Olympics. \nKrzyzewski will coach through the 2016 Rio Olympics, along with a staff that includes Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim. Boeheim has served as an assistant to Krzyzewski since 2005, a span in which the United States has regained its dominance of the international game. Gregg Popovich named head coach of USA Basketball Men's National Team for 2017-20: https://t.co/S8304VMlFQ #USABMNT pic.twitter.com/nc93uuh282 — USA Basketball (@usabasketball) October 23, 2015 \nBoeheim, through administrative assistant Kelly Seubert, said he would \"probably not\" continue coaching the national team after the switch. \nBoeheim served as an assistant at the request of Krzyzewski, and the two have become close friends through the process. Popovich will likely bring in a staff of his own. \nKrzyzewski, who announced his decision to step down earlier this week, took over the team in 2005, and Boeheim joined him a year later. The team won a bronze medal in their first international tournament and hasn't lost since, putting together an international record of 75-1 and winning a pair of Olympic gold medals. The national team currently owns a 63-game winning streak. \nBoeheim could work with USA Basketball in a variety of capacities if he chooses. Syracuse assistant Mike Hopkins works with USA Basketball as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:17:39.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
