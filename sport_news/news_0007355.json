We were the best offensive team in the game and I would bet on our guys not going 0-for-12 very often, but it happens.\"\nAnthopoulos said the Jays were outplayed by the Royals.\n\"They deserve to be in the World Series,\" he said.\nBolstered by Anthopoulos's moves at the trade deadline, the Jays had a dream second half this season.\nThe acquisition of Price, shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, outfielder Ben Revere, Lowe and veteran reliever LaTroy Hawkins added both star power and important role players to a lineup that had already been bolstered in the off-season with the signing of star Canadian catcher Russell Martin and third baseman Josh Donaldson, who went on to have an MVP-calibre season.\nJose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion and Donaldson combined for 120 homers, heading up an exciting lineup that scored 10-plus runs in a club-record 26 games.\nToronto led the majors with a 48-23 record after all-star break, leading the American League in runs (405), home runs (117) and earned-run average (3.33) among other categories.\nRemarkably, Toronto was 50-51 three days before the July 31 trade deadline â€” in fourth place in the AL East, eight games back.\nAs the team rose up the standings, so did attendance. The Jays had 27 sellouts this season including 20 of their last 21 games.\nWhile he didn't want to talk about his contract status, Anthopoulos is optimistic about the team's future.\n\"I do think we've turned a corner as an organization,\" he said. \"I think we're in a position to win for a long time.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:53:33.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
