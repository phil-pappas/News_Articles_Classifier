The previous mark was 31 set by Texas and Seattle in 1997, STATS said. \nThe Nationals won the opener when Bryce Harper hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the eighth off Addison Reed (3-3). It was Harper's 42nd homer. Rafael Martin (2-0) got one out as the Nationals ended a six-game skid against the Mets. Felipe Rivero worked the ninth for his second save. \nANGELS 11, RANGERS 10 \nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — The Los Angeles Angels rallied for five runs in the ninth inning, taking their playoff hopes into the final day of the regular season with a wild win that again kept Texas from clinching the AL West. \nRangers closer Shawn Tolleson, pitching for the fifth straight day, entered with a 10-6 lead and allowed consecutive homers to Erick Aybar and Kole Calhoun. \nRoss Ohlendorf (3-1) relieved and retired Mike Trout on a grounder, then gave up Albert Pujols' double on a difficult popup to short right that ricocheted off first baseman Mike Napoli's glove, whose back was to the plate. \nC.J. Cron, David Freese, Carlos Perez and Giavotella had consecutive two-out singles, with Cron, Perez and Giavotella driving in runs. \nJosh Hamilton homered twice for Texas against his former team. \nRAYS 4, BLUE JAYS 3 \nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Tim Beckham had a two-run single with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning for Tampa Bay. \nGrady Sizemore had a leadoff double off Roberto Osuna (1-6), who later loaded the bases with two outs with two walks. Beckham won it with his liner to left. \nEdwin Encarnacion homered for the fourth consecutive game for the Blue Jays, who fell one game behind Kansas City for the AL's best record and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs heading into Sunday's end of the regular season. Toronto holds the tiebreaker. \nJohn Jaso and Asdrubal Cabrera homered for the Rays. Alex Colome (8-5) worked the ninth to get the win. \nEncarnacion put the Blue Jays up 3-1 on his 39th homer this season, a two-run shot off Brandon Gomes in the sixth. \nROYALS 5, TWINS 1 \nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Twins were eliminated from the AL playoff race when they were stifled by Yordano Ventura for seven innings in a loss to Kansas City. \nVentura (13-8) carried a no-hitter into the fifth and struck out 11 to win his third straight decision for Kansas City, which took a one-game lead over Toronto, which lost to Tampa Bay, for home-field advantage throughout the postseason. \nBlaine Boyer (3-6) allowed two runs, one earned, while getting two outs for Minnesota (83-78), which committed two errors in a costly four-run seventh inning for the Royals. \nMinnesota loaded the bases in the ninth before Wade Davis struck out Kennys Vargas and Eduardo Escobar for his 17th save in 18 chances. \nORIOLES 4, YANKEES 3, 2nd game \nORIOLES 9, YANKEES 2, 1st game \nBALTIMORE (AP) — The New York Yankees failed to clinch home field in the AL wild-card game, getting swept by Baltimore in a day-night doubleheader. \nOnly needing one win to host Tuesday's one-game playoff, reliever Dellin Betances allowed the go-ahead run in the second game to score on a wild pitch in the eighth inning. The Orioles roughed up Ivan Nova in the opener. \nNew York (87-74) has lost five of six. Should the Yankees and the Astros end up tied, Houston holds the tiebreaker and the game would be played at Minute Maid Park. \nIn the night game, Paul Janish led off the eighth with a single, reached second on a wild pitch by Betances (6-4), and got to third on Gerardo Parra's bunt single before scoring on a second wild pitch with one out. \nT.J. McFarland (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings for Baltimore and Zach Britton got his 36th save in a ninth inning in which pinch-runner Rico Noel was picked off first. \nManny Machado hit his 35th home run, connecting for a fourth consecutive game, and Nolan Reimold hit the first leadoff homer of his career. \nNew York was 3 for 19 with runners in scoring position in the doubleheader. \nIn the first game, Nova (6-11) allowed eight hits in 5 2-3 innings, walked three and hit a batter to raise his ERA to 5.07. \nBaltimore's Wei-Yin Chen (11-8) allowed two runs in six-plus innings. Parra had four hits and three RBIs. Machado drove in three runs and J.J. Hardy had three hits. \nREDS 3, PIRATES 1 \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — A.J. Burnett was outpitched by a rookie in the final regular-season start of his career, and Cincinnati prevented Pittsburgh from clinching home-field advantage in the NL wild-card game by snapping a 13-game skid. \nPittsburgh still needs a win Sunday or a loss by the Chicago Cubs to host the one-game playoff Wednesday night. If the Cubs beat Milwaukee — and the Pirates lose to Cincinnati again — the wild-card showdown would be played at Wrigley Field. \nBrandon Finnegan (5-2) limited the Pirates to one run in six innings. Adam Duvall hit his fifth homer and Aroldis Chapman got four outs for his 33rd save, ending Cincinnati's longest losing streak in 70 years. \nBurnett, who plans to retire after 17 seasons, gave up three runs and five hits with four walks in 6 2-3 innings. His nine strikeouts gave him 2,513 in his career, pushing Burnett (9-7) past Hall of Famer Christy Mathewson and into 30th place on the all-time list. \nCUBS 1, BREWERS 0 \nMILWAUKEE (AP) — Kyle Hendricks allowed one hit and struck out eight in six innings, and Chicago kept alive its hopes to host to the NL wild card game. \nChicago won its seventh straight game behind a stellar effort from Hendricks (8-7). He held Milwaukee without a baserunner until Martin Maldonado singled with one out in the sixth. \nHector Rondon tossed the ninth for his 30th save. \nAddison Russell drove in the game's only run off Tyler Wagner (0-2), singling home Chris Coughlan from third in the second inning. \nINDIANS 2, RED SOX 0 \nCLEVELAND (AP) — Corey Kluber pitched eight innings while Carlos Santana and Ryan Raburn homered for Cleveland. \nKluber (9-16) ended his rocky season with a strong performance, allowing three hits and striking out nine. The right-hander, who won the AL Cy Young Award last season, recorded his first victory since Aug. 14. \nSantana led off the second with a home run while Raburn's homer started the fourth. Both landed several rows deep in the bleachers in left field. \nCraig Breslow (0-4) gave up both home runs, his only mistakes in 5 1/3 innings. The veteran left-hander made his second career start after 522 relief appearances. \nCody Allen pitched the ninth for his 33rd save. \nWHITE SOX 4, TIGERS 3 \nCHICAGO (AP) — Leury Garcia singled home the winning run in the ninth as the White Sox avoided finishing last in the AL Central. \nPinch-hitter J.B. Shuck doubled to tie the game in the bottom of the ninth. After Jose Abreu was intentionally walked, Garcia singled. \nMiguel Cabrera hit a two-run home run for the Tigers and virtually locked up the AL batting title. He had three hits to raise his AL-best average to .338 while Boston's Xander Bogaerts was hitless in four at-bats to drop to .320. \nDetroit is 2 1-2 games behind Chicago for last place in the division after winning the Central the last four seasons. \nNate Jones (2-2) struck out one for the victory. Neftali Feliz (3-4) allowed two runs while only getting two outs for his seventh blown save. \nGIANTS 3, ROCKIES 2 \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Jake Peavy pitched five innings for his fifth consecutive win, and rookie Kelby Tomlinson hit an inside-the-park home run during San Francisco's victory over Colorado. \nBrandon Crawford and Marlon Byrd also homered off Chris Rusin (6-10) for the Giants, who beat the Rockies for the eighth time in 18 meetings this year. \nPeavy (8-6) allowed one run and four hits to improve to 5-0 over his last eight starts. \nBen Paulsen homered for the Rockies, who have lost four of five. \nMARLINS 7, PHILLIES 6, 1ST GAME \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Christian Yelich had a career-high five hits, Marcell Ozuna drove in the go-ahead run in the ninth inning and Dee Gordon got his 200th hit of the season as Miami rallied past Philadelphia in the first game of a doubleheader. \nThe loss ensured the Phillies a second straight last-place finish in the NL East. \nYelich singled with one out in the ninth off Ken Giles (6-3) and scored the tying run on Martin Prado's triple. Prado scored the go-ahead run on Ozuna's single. \nGordon had a pair of hits and an RBI. He became the first Marlins player since Hanley Ramirez in 2007 to get 200 hits. \nGordon also had a pair of steals to raise his season total to 58, overtaking injured Reds outfielder Billy Hamilton for the league lead. \nJeff Mathis homered for the Marlins. Chris Narveson (3-1) tossed a scoreless eighth and A.J. Ramos earned his 31st save in 37 chances. \nRamos struck out Maikel Franco with a runner on second to end the game. Franco batted for the first time since breaking his left wrist Aug. 11 when he was hit by a pitch. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:21:35.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
