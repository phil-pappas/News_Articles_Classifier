After finalizing their roster earlier in the day and announcing it, the team left Pensacola before dusk Wednesday night and traveled 16 hours to Peoria, Ill. The Ice Flyers practice at 2 p.m. Thursday in final prep for the season-opener Friday night against the Peoria Rivermen. The two teams play again Saturday. \nThe games begin the Ice Flyers' seventh season in the Southern Professional Hockey League and the 20th year since minor league hockey first arrived in the Pensacola area. The SPHL has extended this season two weeks longer, now finishing in mid-April, to allow teams more weekend home dates and more flexibility in scheduling. It means the playoffs will run through April. \n\"I think we have a good schedule,\" Ice Flyers coach Rod Aldoff said. \"This is the best one we've had since I have been here ... An extra two weeks is not a problem at all. I think the idea was for (league owners) to get more weekends which helps attendance, so it was a good thing.\" \nAnother good thing, Aldoff believes, is the makeup of his team. In finalizing their roster, the Ice Flyers have nine returning players, nine newcomers. They return their top two scorers, led by Adam Pawlick, who was announced Wednesday as the team captain. Pawlick led the SPHL in scoring with 32 goals, 34 assists and 66 points. \nCorey Banfield, the SPHL second-leading scorer was named assistant captain, along with veteran defenseman Cole Ruwe, 30, who played the last two years with Peoria and grew up in Pekin, Ill., so this weekend brings an emotional return against some former teammates. Ruwe begins his ninth season in minor league hockey. \nFollowing Saturday's 2-1 preseason win against Louisiana, Aldoff made five roster moves, including adding defensemen Jeremy Gates and Zach Josepher. Both played for the Ice Flyers in parts of last season, along with goaltender Matt Zenzola. The second goaltender kept from training camp is Andrew Walsh. \nAdam Pawlick, working puck around net in game last season, was named Pensacola Ice Flyers team captain as roster was finalized.

I have been very impressed with the attitude, the leadership from everybody. Especially the returning guys and the veteran guys we have picked up. Just a super bunch of guys. We have had some great practices and the pace is high, tempo is high. It has been great.\" \nAldoff had a difficult time Tuesday paring the roster to 18 players. Since his arrival as Ice Flyers coach, he has said it's the most difficult part of his job to tell players they are not able to stay. \nOf the players who dressed for Saturday's scrimmage a sizable portion did not make the team. \n\"That is always the tough part of being a coach,\" Aldoff said. \"But obviously there are decisions we have to make.\" \nIn addition to starting its 12th season, the SPHL enhanced its future by announcing Tuesday that Roanoke (Va.) would join the league next season. The quest is to eventually get a northern and southern set of divisions. \nThe Pensacola Ice Flyers (blue uniforms) have established a roster for the upcoming season. (Photo: Bruce Graner/bgraner@pnj.com) \nThe Ice Flyers are coming off a first-round exit in the playoffs, after advancing to the SPHL President's Cup finals the past three years and winning back-to-back to titles. \n\"I have gotten to know the league a lot better,\" he said \"But at the end of the day, this is a new team, this is a new year and we have to write our own book and take one chapter at a time.. I am looking forward to that. I am excited to start. We have a great group of guys in that (locker) room.\" \nWANT TO FOLLOW? \nWHAT: Pensacola Ice Flyers season-opener. \nWHO: Ice Flyers vs. Peoria Rivermen. \nWHERE : Peoria Civic Center, Peoria, Ill. \nWHEN: Friday, 7:05 p.m. \nON WEB : TheSPHL.com \nHOME OPENER : Friday, Oct. 30, 7:05 p.m. vs. Louisiana IceGators. \nICE FLYERS ROSTER : Goaltenders (2) Andrew Walsh, Matt Zenzola.
