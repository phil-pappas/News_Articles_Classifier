The Irishman also recorded eight birdies in his round at Kingsbarns.\n\"I kind of needed it,\" he said. \"I got off to a bit of a ropey start. I was hitting a lot of poor full shots.\"\nOf his hole in one, he said: \"It was exactly as I pictured it ... I thought I hit it close and when I saw it drop, it was great. Nice little bonus there.\"\nBroberg had taken an early lead on day one, with a 64 that also featured eight birdies but no bogeys.\nDenmark's Soren Kjeldsen and English pair Richard Bland and Anthony Wall are a shot further back.\nBut defending champion Oliver Wilson is way off the pace after the first day, shooting a two-over-par 74 at St Andrews.\n(Reporting by Neville Dalton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:55:22.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
