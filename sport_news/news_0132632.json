They explain the list isn’t made for MVP’s, overall value to a team or how one might look at All-Americans, but rather you’re playing a game of pickup and want to pick the best players. \nJamal Murray led the way for the Wildcats at No. 5 as Skal was right behind him at No. 6. In an ironic fashion Kyle Wiltjer came in at No. 4, just goes to show you how good Cal is at finding talent. Also on the list were Tyler Ulis at No. 33 and Alex Poythress at No. 87. North Carolina, Kansas, Maryland and Duke also had four players on the list. \nKris Dunn was voted No. 1 by the staff. Now, I know he’s not on the list now but at the end of the season don’t be surprised to see Isaiah Briscoe on this list. Thoughts? Complaints? Let me hear them.
