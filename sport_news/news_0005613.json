We are happy to provide them the exposure of the highest standard and it will help them get better,\" Champika Sayal, secretary general, WGAI said. \n\nAditi is in tremendous form and has recently qualified for the Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia. She became the first Asian to claim the St. Rule's trophy and the Lawson trophy at the St. Andrews Links in June this year. \n\nThe 17-year-old Bangalorean added another feather to her cap when she became the first Indian to win the Ladies British Amateur Stroke Play Golf Championship at the Moortown Golf Club. \n\nAditi also has had a good run at the Hero Women's Indian Open and has finished as the best amateur in 2012 and 2014. \n\nIn fact, she was the joint leader after the first round of the HWIO'12, shooting three under 69. She also holds the WGAI's record for lowest single round score on the Hero Women's Professional Golf Tour. \n\nDelighted to be a part of this coveted tournament, Aditi said, \"I am really looking forward to playing in the Indian Open. The DLF course has changed a bit which will be a fun and a new experience. I have been playing good all year so I want to continue the form. I am excited to play the Hero Women's Indian Open and it is one of my favourite events of the year.\" \n\nRidhima is placed second in the IGU Order of Merit followed by Seher Atwal. This will be their maiden appearance in the event.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:23:28.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
