Waterhouse Posted: 10/09/2015 10:35:44 PM PDT Updated: 10/10/2015 12:03:17 AM PDT The Monte Vista High football team is one dangerous offensive squad. With a balanced attack, the Mustangs cruised past host Amador Valley in East Bay Athletic League on Friday night to the tune of 34-12. \nMonte Vista (5-1, 2-0 EBAL), which failed to score in the first quarter, erupted for 17 points in the second. It was paced by the ground attack of Shane Perry, who rushed for 93 yards on 16 carries including three touchdowns -- two in the second quarter. \nThe Mustangs also got a stellar performance from quarterback Jake Haener, who was 17 of 25 for 208 yards passing with a touchdown. His top target was Noah Sol, who caught 12 passes for 151 yards and a touchdown. \nAmador (4-2, 1-1) closed to within 17-6 on Ronnie Jones' 39 yard touchdown pass to Abraham Flynn with 7:07 left in the third quarter. \nJones finished with 118 yards passing and Flynn caught six passes for 96 yards. \nBut Monte Vista, which is ranked No. 4 by this newspaper, answered with a five-play, 66-yard drive that culminated with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Haener to Sol that gave the Mustangs a commanding 24-6 lead with 4:52 left in the third quarter. \nAmador Valley, ranked No. 11, got to within 24-12 on a 22-yard touchdown run by Jones, but the Mustangs once again answered. \nThis time they struck for 2-yard touchdown run by Perry on a drive that ate up nearly five minutes in the fourth quarter. Advertisement \nMonte Vista's final score came off the leg of junior kicker Peyton Henry, who boomed a 52-yard field goal with 1:45 left that put Monte Vista up 34-12. It was his second field goal of the game. The first was a 36-yarder in the second quarter.

De La Salle 48, San Ramon Valley 0 Antoine Custer rushed for 88 yards and two touchdowns on a short night, leading the Spartans (5-1) over the visiting Wolves (1-5). De La Salle's Alex Colon-Aguilar recovered a fumble on the game's opening kickoff at the San Ramon Valley 5. Colon-Aguilar took it in from the 4 one play later. \nThe Spartans were up 28-0 at the end of the first quarter and 42-0 midway through the second quarter. The clock was running the entire second half. \nKevin Davidson started at quarterback for the Wolves, his first start of the season. The 6-foot-4, 220-pound senior had sat out the first five games after being ruled ineligible last year while playing for McClymonds. Davidson completed 2 of 11 passes for 20 yards. \nDavidson originally played lower-level football for San Ramon Valley, then transferred to McClymonds as a junior, where he threw for 1,117 yards and 20 touchdowns in four games. However, he was declared ineligible after residency questions arose. He returned to the Wolves in August. -- Damin Esper, correspondent San Ramon V. 0 0 0 0-- 0 De La Salle 28 14 0 6-- 48 DLS -- Colon-Aguilar 4 run (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Custer 54 run (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Custer 23 run (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Sweeney 10 run (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Andrade 1 fumble return (Walsh kick) \nDLS -- Colon-Aguilar 3 run (Williams kick) \nDLS -- Coray-Dozier 8 run (kick failed) Records -- San Ramon Valley 1-5, De La Salle 5-1. Miramonte 49, Dougherty Valley 10 Senior Sean Lindberg caught two touchdowns and passed for a third as the Matadors remained undefeated with a decisive Diablo Foothill Athletic League win over the host Wildcats. Lindberg had touchdown receptions of 58 and 86 yards and junior quarterback Tim Tague had a huge first half. \nTague had 260 yards and three scores on 8 for 13 passing, all in the first half, as Miramonte took a commanding 34-10 lead and never looked back. \nDefensively, the Matadors (7-0, 3-0 DFAL) held Dougherty Valley to just 155 yards after their initial possession of the game. \nThe Wildcats (5-2, 1-2) came out of the gates quickly as Teni Adeoti broke through the line with a 58-yard scamper on the second play from scrimmage for a 7-0 advantage. \nClayton Stehr led the Matatord with 95 yards and three touchdowns on the ground as the Matadors finished with 486 yards.

Najee Harris then scored on Antioch's second play from scrimmage, and the Panthers were off and running. \nHarris ran for 126 yards and three touchdowns on just four first-half carries, and Payne added a 72-yard scoring reception from Numan Najib, who threw for 166 yards and two scores. \nJamir Wilson also scored a defensive touchdown for the Panthers in the first quarter, on a 15-yard strip and score. -- Nate Smith, correspondent Antioch 40 6 7 0-- 53 Heritage 0 8 0 6-- 14 A -- Payne 74 punt return (Harris run) \nA -- Harris 36 run (Harris run) \nA -- Wilson 15 fumble return (Harris run) \nA -- Harris 4 run (Beltram pass from Harris) \nA -- Payne 72 pass from Najib (Harris run) \nH -- Quinn 38 pass from Zell (Zell run) \nA -- Harris 71 run (run failed) \nA -- Hafoka 66 pass from Najib (kick good) \nH -- Magalei 5 pass from Zell (run failed) Records: Heritage 3-3, 0-1 BVAL; Antioch 6-0, 1-0.

Atascadero 28, James Logan 27, OT The visiting Colts (5-2) came back from a 21-0 second-quarter deficit to tie the game in the fourth quarter and force overtime. But after Logan's Damani Sistena scored on a run in overtime, the point-after-touchdown kick was blocked. The Greyhounds (5-1) then scored on their first possession of overtime and converted the PAT to win. Atascadero converted a fourth-and-2 play on the Logan 5-yard line with a 3-yard run, then scored on another run. \nThe Colts' Ahmari Davis had two touchdowns rushing and played phenomenally both at safety and running back, James Logan coach George Zuber said. \n-- Staff report Encinal 34, Castro Valley 7 The host Jets (4-2, 1-0 West Alameda County Conference-Foothill League) took a 26-7 lead in the first half on their way to a victory over the Trojans (1-5, 0-1). \nJets quarterback Jeremiah Braxton threw two touchdowns passes and ran for a score.
