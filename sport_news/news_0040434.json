But the status of its starting quarterback, sophomore Patrick Mahomes, remains a mystery following Tech's 55-52 loss against then-No. 3 TCU.\n\"He's day-to-day right now,\" Kliff Kingsbury said during his Monday news conference. \"We'll see how it feels today, try to get him moving around a little bit and just kind of go from there.\"\nKingsbury noted Argyle-native and sophomore receiver Ian Sadler also remains day-to-day.\nMahomes currently leads the nation in points responsible for and ranks fourth in total offense despite suffering an apparent lower-leg injury during the first quarter against TCU, which dropped to No. 4 in the Sunday's AP poll. He was able to finish the game, posting 392 passing yards, 38 rushing yards and three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) in the loss.\nDespite playing in an offense that ranks fourth in the nation for passing yards, Mahomes' five rushing touchdowns rank second in the Big 12 and Kingsbury knows his quarterback was unable to display some of that versatility after suffering the injury.\n\"There were a couple of things that [Mahomes] may have been able to do,\" he said. \"A couple throws, a couple of times he probably could've extended plays, but that's part of the game.\"\nTexas Tech will face No. 5 Baylor at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, but Kingsbury said he is unsure as to the severity of Mahomes' injury or if it will keep him from playing.\n\"I don't have some scientific diagnosis,\" Kingsbury said. \"I just know that he was hampered Saturday and we'll see how he is today.\"\nJunior quarterback Davis Webb is currently listed as Texas Tech's backup to Mahomes. Webb made eight starts last season for the Red Raiders and continues to play a vital role in the team's weekly preparation.\n\"We try to push some reps - quite a few reps his way every week,\" Kingsbury said. \"This week particularly, we'll get him going and if that's the direction we have to go, have him ready to go.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_"], "published": "2015-09-28T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:45:12.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
