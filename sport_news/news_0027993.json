Sanders was scheduled to attend a taping of \"The Ellen Degeneres Show.\"\nIn Tuesday's Democratic Debate, Clinton contrasted her record with Sanders' more conservative positions on gun restrictions while suggesting the Vermont senator is too liberal on other issues.\nSanders offered perhaps the most memorable line, declaring that \"the American people are sick and tired of hearing about\" Clinton's emails. But Sanders made clear he wasn't defending Clinton's use of a private server in her home while serving as secretary of state.\nInstead, he argued Americans have more serious concerns.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:55:16.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
