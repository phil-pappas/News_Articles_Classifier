While that sounds like hyperbole, in the case Wolverines starting center Graham Glasgow, that’s the truth. \nAccording to the Detroit News , after the player found himself in legal trouble, Harbaugh phoned Glasgow’s dad and said the player needed a more stable living environment; the coach made him settle down with a nice lady and that nice lady was Glasgow’s 81-year-old grandmother Carmella. \n“Coach Harbaugh helped me outside of football and found me a different living arrangement where I wouldn’t make bad mistakes,” the 6-foot-6, 302-pound senior told reporter Angelique Chengelis. “I thought he was going to be really, really harsh. I heard he had a reputation of being, not hard on guys, but very stern and strict, and he ended up being very understanding, which I really appreciated. I love Coach Harbaugh. I know there’s no leeway. I have to do it his way. It’s cut and dry.” \n[ Let’s all watch Jim Harbaugh lose his mind on the sideline ] \nGlasgow now spends more time hanging out with his grandma at their downtown Ann Arbor apartment than he does hanging out with the old crowd that got him in trouble. Some of the pair’s favorite activities include hitting the gym and watching “Dancing with the Stars.” \n“I’m an 81-year-old co-ed,” Carmella told Chengelis, laughing. “I’m the only old lady on the elevator in the building. But this is a win-win for everybody. You know what I’m getting out of this? I see a lot of kids trying to find their way. They don’t know how they fit in yet. These are kids and, really, do we all know how we fit in yet? \n“I’ve said to Graham, ‘You know, this is probably a blessing in disguise what happened,’ and he said, ‘You know, Grandma, I think you’re right.’ ” \nApparently, so was Harbaugh.
