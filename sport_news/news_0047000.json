But he has found that his size — including his 7-foot wingspan, large hands and feet that require size 16 shoes — also serves as an asset in swimming.\n\"It definitely helps you,\" he said on Wednesday as the team began making last-minute practice preparations for Friday's Orange and White Meet at Allan Jones Intercollegiate Aquatic Center. \"Most of the world-class sprinters are at least 6 feet tall.\"\nDeCoursey comes to Tennessee after winning the Indiana state 50-yard freestyle championship his junior year in 20.59 seconds and his senior year, dropping to 20.08 seconds, at Zionsville Community High School. He also was state champion last year in the 100 free (44.26).\nHe is one of several outstanding freshmen that coach Matt Kredich hopes can help the team do even better this year than last year's fifth-place finish in the SEC.\n\"Kyle is one of several highly accomplished freshmen that we have,\" he said, adding that DeCoursey's U.S. national junior team teammates Ethan Browne and Joey Reilman are among the others.\n\"The whole class is very focused. It's a group that wants to bring SEC championships to Knoxville. We've got some really high goals in the crosshairs and really good leadership in the junior and senior classes, but a lot of ability in the freshman and sophomore classes.\"\nDeCoursey said he became familiar with Tennessee because fellow Zionsville resident Alex Cleveland from the women's team signed with Tennessee the previous year. He chose the Vols after seriously considering Purdue, Louisville and Texas.\n\"I felt at home with the coaches and teammates,\" he said.\nHe said his goals for this year are simply to help the team do well. If he can improve enough to place or earn points in the SEC or NCAA meets, that is all the better.\n\"Whether or not I'll be swimming at the SECs, I can still push the group at practice,\" he said.\nKredich is not sure if DeCoursey will end up being his team's best sprint freestyle swimmer this year, but he knows he will be quick both in his times and likely development.\n\"One of the most intriguing things about him is that he only started swimming year-round his freshman year in high school,\" his coach said. \"He's a quick learner. Technically, he's already really good. He's got really good speed and really good endurance.\n\"The sky is really the limit for him. He is going to run out of time in college before he stops getting better.\"\nWhile he feels at home in Tennessee due to the quality of training to get faster in the pool, DeCoursey also likes having the opportunity to enjoy a slower pace away from the aquatic center.\n\"I feel like the people down here are more relaxed and low key, even though it's a college town,\" he said.\nJohn Shearer is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:17:49.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
