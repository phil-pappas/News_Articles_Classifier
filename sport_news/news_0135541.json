The Selecao began their qualifying campaign for the 2018 tournament in Russia with a 0-2 loss to Chile in Santiago on Thursday. Venezuela also started with a loss, stumbling 0-1 at home to Paraguay, Xinhua reported. “I think 1-0 would be a good score,” Willian told reporters on Sunday. “It would give us three points and that’s what we want.” The last time the teams met was in the Copa America in June, when Brazil secured an unconvincing 2-1 victory over Noel Sanvicente’s side. Willian, one of his team’s few shining lights in Thursday’s loss to Chile, said the Selecao is preparing for another tough contest at Fortaleza’s Castelao Arena. “Teams are better prepared than they were before,” the Chelsea player said. “There was a time when Brazil would be expected to easily beat Venezuela. But not anymore. They were tough to come up against in the Copa America and we expect it to be the same here.” In other South American zone qualifiers on Tuesday, Ecuador host Bolivia, Uruguay are at home to Colombia, Argentina travel to Paraguay and Chile are away against Peru.
