That Kansas City trio last year? A 10th-round pick, a mediocre starter and a 5-foot-10 fireballer. The Dodgers backed up Clayton Kershaw on Tuesday night with a pair of converted catchers throwing in the upper 90s; take note, Christian Vazquez. The Cubs stamped out the Cardinals with a litany of has-been and never-was starters, none of whom really possess the kind of stuff that screams bullpen transition. It's times like this where constructing a formidable major-league bullpen seems a task too inscrutable for an honest, worthwhile effort — like sitting down to sincerely map out the topography of heaven. Is there anything real to be known, or is it all just idle speculation? The Red Sox enter this offseason cognizant of the fact that their bullpen requires a complete overhaul. How you characterize the performance of Boston's relief corps in 2016 depends largely on how polite you'd like to be — whether it's a handyman's dream, a fixer-upper or a dumpster fire. The Red Sox bullpen posted a 4.24 ERA in 2015, the third-worst mark in the American League. But hey, ERA can be deceiving for a bullpen, right? Well, Boston's allowed more home runs than any other pen in baseball. It had the second-worst WHIP in the American League and it struck out the third-fewest batters per nine innings. We'd try grasping for straws, but man, it was even called for more balks than any bullpen in baseball. The silver lining is that Koji Uehara is under contract for one more season, and he isn't expected to have any lingering effects from his broken wrist by the time spring training comes around. Junichi Tazawa, despite a miserable finish to the season, can be penciled into a set-up role, and Robbie Ross Jr. performed well down the stretch when trusted with some higher-leverage situations. Tommy Layne was good provided he was limited to facing lefties. That’s three or four spots out of seven the Sox can feel reasonably confident about. Beyond that quartet, there's a plethora of possibilities. Maybe Matt Barnes can blossom out of the bullpen. Maybe Noe Ramirez's late-season success in the uncommon role as a right-handed specialist can be extrapolated. Maybe Heath Hembree can be trusted with bigger spots. Maybe Pat Light and his 100 mph fastball can work its way into the late innings. A thorough analysis of bullpen success stories teaches us not to rule out the maybes; just look at what Alex Wilson did for the Tigers this past season. But it also teaches us you can't count on them. And president Dave Dombrowski sounded like a man eager to protect the back end of the game with a bigger-name acquisition when talking on Tuesday. Building bullpens was Dombrowski's Achilles heel in Detroit, but it can't be said he didn’t go after some established late-game arms. He signed Joe Nathan, Joaquin Benoit, Jose Valverde and Todd Jones. He traded for Joakim Soria. Page 2 of 2 - \"I love hard-throwers,\" Dombrowski said, reiterating his long-known preference for a pitching staff. \"But I love hard-throwers that get people out. It’s a situation where sort of a mixture of getting the best guys out there to get the job done. Where that’s going to take us, I don’t know. I’m open to trades. I’m open to free agency.\" Dombrowski said he was open to placing Uehara in different roles in the pen beyond closer, suggesting he may have his eye on the two biggest relief prizes this winter: Cincinnati's Aroldis Chapman and San Diego's Craig Kimbrel. Chapman has a year left on his deal with a Reds team that just finished with the game's second-worst record; a proper rebuild would start with moving the left-hander whose fastball velocity reaches higher than any temperature in New England ever has. Kimbrel is locked up for longer, but the Padres were open to moving him in July and could look to attach a bad contract to his — the same way Atlanta did when it traded Kimbrel west last April. Obviously, the acquisition of a Chapman or Kimbrel to pitch the ninth would alter the look of the Boston bullpen. Uehara could slide into the eighth, though the Sox would have to be more proactive about limiting his innings in a set-up role. Tazawa would have as good a track record as any seventh-inning guy in baseball. But Dombrowski's problems constructing bullpens haven't derived from issues in the back end as much as a lack of depth, and the Red Sox clearly have more than one hole in the pen. There are some intriguing free-agent options in names like Darren O'Day, Tyler Clippard and Antonio Bastardo, but those pitchers all have a lot of mileage on their arms — something that doesn’t generally play well going forward . Bobby Parnell is a former closer who struggled his first year back from Tommy John surgery. Washington's Drew Storen — more than Washington's Jonathan Papelbon — could appeal to the Red Sox should he be shopped. ( Brian MacPherson explored more creative possibilities here. ) The expansion of reliable bullpen arms beyond the final inning or two has altered the way baseball games are played now, especially the most important ones. Bullpens are rarely a team's top priority come the offseason, and renovating the relief corps isn't tops on Dombrowski's list — not with an ace to procure and Hanley Ramirez to figure out. But it could be just as important a piece for the Red Sox in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:20:49.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
