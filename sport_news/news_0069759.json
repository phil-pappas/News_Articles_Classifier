Somehow, NC State and Duke wound up with coinciding open dates. Maybe we should give the schedule makers a D. \nOtherwise, there are A-list winners. \nLarry Fedora, UNC, A: It bears repeating that the Tar Heels have as many explosive offensive players as Clemson, Florida State or anyone else in the ACC. \nThrow in the fact that the schedule wasn’t taxing from the start and now looks even more manageable and a 9- or 10-win finish is likely. \nBut that said, Fedora and his team (5-1, 2-0 ACC) needed the 50-14 walkover against Wake Forest to help fans forget a week that included defensive backs M.J. Stewart and Mike Hughes getting suspended after being charged with assault relating to an incident that occurred after a key win at Georgia Tech on Oct. 3. \nPrevious grades: Three As, one B, one C. \nRuffin McNeill, ECU, A: Taking everything into account, the 30-17 win over Tulsa probably was the best defensive performance of the past two seasons for the Pirates, but the offense never really got in sync. \nA debatable pass interference call against DaShaun Amos aside, the Pirates committed way too many penalties, including a couple after whistles. \nIt all adds up to a performance that won’t compute against No. 22 Temple (6-0, 3-0 AAC) on Thursday in Greenville. It’s a game the Pirates (4-3, 2-1) have to win to maintain legitimate hope of claiming the East Division and reaching the league title game. But McNeill gets all due credit for safely directing his team through a demanding schedule slice that included four road games and what now will be eight straight weeks without any sort of extra time to mend. \nPrevious grades: Two As, two Bs, two Cs. \nRon Rivera, Carolina Panthers, A: Cam Newton didn’t have his best stuff, the receivers had trouble hearing cadence and the Panthers still won, 27-23 , at closing time amid the usual thunderous Seattle chaos. \nThey really don’t look like a classic NFL powerhouse, but the Panthers are 5-0 and 3-0 on the road with Philadelphia (2-3) and Indianapolis (3-3) on deck. Just for dessert, Atlanta’s defense wilted early and often against New Orleans in the Falcons’ first misstep after four early wins. \nPrevious grades: Four As. \nCheers: The primary turning point thus far in the ACC season – and one of the biggest nationally – occurred on Aug. 24 in Tallahassee. That was the day a Leon County jury found Florida State running back Dalvin Cook not guilty of assault on a female. \nHis suspension from the team then lifted, Cook has been a terror through the first half of the season – 955 yards rushing (8.7 yards per-carry average), 11 pass receptions for 131 more yards and 11 touchdowns – even though he’s been slowed by a hamstring injury at times. \nAt this rate, the redshirt sophomore could break the ACC seasonal rushing record set by Boston College’s Andre Williams with 2,177 yards (6.1 yards per carry) in 2013. \nIf not Williams, Cook certainly is on pace to overtake former Virginia star Thomas Jones for No. 2 on the ACC single-season list. Jones had 1,798 yards in 1999. \nThe Florida State seasonal record of 1,242 yards by Warrick Dunn in 1995 is a near lock to fall. \nSince Cook (1,007 yards last season) is likely to turn pro after this season, he probably won’t pass Dunn’s school career record of 3,959 yards … \nMemphis has to be looking attractive to Big 12 back-roomers after a 37-24 win over then-No. 11 Mississippi. With remaining games against Navy, Houston and Temple, the AAC schedule is stacked against Justin Fuente’s fourth Tiger team. \nBut if the Big 12 decides to take on two new teams soon, which seems likely, Memphis’ 6-0 start, a 10-3 record last season and the win over the Rebels will make for impressive resume fodder. Tiger quarterback Paxton Lynch (13 touchdown tosses, one interception) is a junior but could be an NFL draft first-rounder … \nThere’s not much at all standing between Iowa (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten), the conference’s West Division title and a 12-0 regular-season finish after a 40-10 rout of Northwestern. \nRemaining for the Hawkeyes are Maryland (2-4, 0-2), Indiana (4-3, 0-3), Minnesota (4-3, 1-2), Purdue (1-6, 0-3) and Nebraska (3-4, 1-2). Keep in mind that it took a last-second, 57-yard field goal for Iowa to put away Pitt, 27-24, in September … \nJeers: Various officials in several leagues would have to get failing grades based on much of what happened during the weekend. \nIn the ACC, one crew wouldn’t count to 11 in the Pitt win at Georgia Tech and another called an imaginary fair-catch signal on Ryan Switzer in Carolina’s win. The Big Ten bunch working Michigan State’s rousing win at Michigan should have turned it over to an intramural crew at halftime. \nThe AAC troop at ECU and the Pac-12 outfit for Stanford’s win over UCLA on Thursday threw so many flags they should have been placed on pitch count limits. \nOfficiating obviously can be a tough job and the rulebook needs some serious editing, but it isn’t as difficult as some of these folks are making it … \nThere are some really sick Michigan fans out there. When the threats against a player – punter Blake O’Neill – reach the stage that an interim athletic director (Jim Hackett) has to beg fans to show the player some mercy, the situation is beyond sanity. O’Neill’s fumble led to Michigan State’s winning touchdown in Ann Arbor. It was a bummer for the Wolverines, but O’Neill sure as heck didn’t do it on purpose. Come on, folks. Get a grip.
