David Frost beat Kenny Perry of the US 7 and 6 in 1996, while another Korean, K.J. Choi, partnered Adam Scott to a 7 and 6 victory over Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker in 2011. \n\nBut the Presidents Cup remains on a knife-edge with the score 7.5-7.5 with three matches to be completed. \n\nCheered on by massive galleries out to see their Korean golfing hero on a damp, cold, windy and overcast day at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club in Incheon, South Korea, Bae slammed home three birdies in a row from the seventh to take the International team duo to four up. \n\nMatsuyama, not to be outdone, rammed home two more on the 10th and 11th as the pair stormed to six up with seven to play. \n\nSuch was their dominance that when they halved the next hole to lie six up with six to play, Walker mistakenly offered a handshake thinking the Americans had already lost. \n\nHe didn't have to wait long as the Asian pair closed it out on the next green to square the overall match score.
