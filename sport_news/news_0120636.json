Especially after a long summer, we're ready to get after it,” said Jets winger Drew Stafford, who scored the empty-netter and eventual game-winner on Saturday. “We're focused on having a good start here, first and foremost.” \nStafford, who signed a two-year extension with the Jets after coming over in the blockbuster deal with the Buffalo Sabres last February, said there were no surprises from his first training camp under head coach Paul Maurice. \n“It was good, pretty much everything I expected coming in,” said Stafford. “Up tempo, high pace, right off the bat, from the first day we got together as a group. A lot of conditioning, a lot of battle. \n“(Maurice) has very high expectations of us. As the exhibition season went on here, we got better as the games went on.” \nMaurice is as eager as everyone else to see if the Jets are ready for the new season. \n“It's an excellent question, it's one you ask every year,” said Maurice, who gave his team Sunday off. “We're where we should be on some things. Our game has changed a little bit, with what we can do with the puck, what we're trying to do with the puck. There's going to be a learning curve this year. But we're not far off.” \nStafford isn't quite sure who he'll be lining up beside when the regular season opens on Thursday against the Boston Bruins. \nAfter spending a good chunk of the pre-season with Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler, Maurice was shuffling the deck for the past few games and Stafford could easily find himself on any of the top-three lines. \nBefore settling in with Scheifele and Wheeler late last season, Stafford also spent time skating with Bryan Little and Andrew Ladd, among others, so he's not concerned about where things eventually end up. \n“You know, it all depends on what (Maurice) wants to do,” said Stafford, who finished the pre-season with two goals and two points in five games. “We've got all of the beginning of next week to get ready and see how the practices go. \n“Either way, we have extremely good depth up front and have many options. We'll see how it goes.” \nWHERE DOES BURMISTROV FIT? \nAlex Burmistrov is another player who will find out where he'll fit in when he shows up for Monday's workout. \nUsed in three games at centre and two on the wing, Burmistrov finished the pre-season with no goals and no points in five games as he worked on adjusting back to the NHL game after playing the past two seasons in the KHL with Ak-Bars Kazan. \nThe smart money is that Burmistrov figures to slot in on the third line beside Adam Lowry and either Stafford or Mathieu Perreault, who left Saturday's game in the third period with what appeared to be an injury to his left leg that Maurice didn't think was serious. \n\nAROUND THE GLASS \nDespite sitting out Saturday's game, Scheifele led the Jets in scoring during the pre-season with three goals and five points in five games. Defenceman Ben Chiarot turned some heads with his impressive display of offensive production, chipping in three goals and four points in five games... \nTeams around the NHL must pare down to their 23-man roster by 4 p.m. CT on Tuesday and the Jets must trim three players to get to that limit (provided they don't claim anyone off waivers before Tuesday)... \nThe Jets primary affiliate, the Manitoba Moose finished off the AHL pre-season with a record of 1-1 after splitting a pair of weekend games against the Iowa Wild. The Moose released forwards Brendan O'Donnell (a Winnipegger), Brant Harris, Mathieu Gagnon and defenceman Mathieu Brodeur from their pro tryout offers on Sunday and reassigned goalie Jussi Olkinuora to the Tulsa Oilers of the ECHL, leaving them with 26 players on their roster. The Moose open the 2015-16 campaign on Friday against the Toronto Marlies at Ricoh Coliseum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:41:21.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
