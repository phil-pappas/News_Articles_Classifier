If Alexander and Allatoona both win the rest of their games, then the Buccaneers would win the region title and the Cougars would secure the No. 2 seed.“There is a lot of region stuff at stake,” East Paulding coach Jon Lindsey said. “Obviously we control our own destiny but we are taking it one week at a time. I think that is the best approach to take when you are getting close to postseason play. You want to prepare your kids mentally for it and be able to close out the regular season. No matter who shows up we got to be ready to play football.”“We understand there will be a lot of people in our region and a lot of people throughout the state who are going to be watching the outcome of this game,” Alexander coach Matthew Combs said. “We understand this game has a lot of implications on standings with the region but we can’t worry about all those things. We just have to worry about what we do on the field.”The Raiders enter the contest as the hotter team, winning each of their last four games by double digits and shutting out Chapel Hill and Lithia Springs.“We kind of finally got in a routine,” Lindsey said. “We started out the season and had a couple of those off weeks. They weren’t back to back but they felt like they were so we could never get into a routine. But I kind of feel like now we’re settling into a groove and playing football every week now.”Last week, East Paulding became the third team to shut out Lithia Springs this season.“I challenged the kids and told them it was a maturity week,” Lindsey said. “You have to be able to handle those weeks because it’s easy to lose focus. It’s easy to look pass somebody who is not having a great season and I was real pleased with how the kids handled the week. Friday night I was very pleased because they were focused and ready to play.”“Defensively, they pursue the football well,” Combs said. “At the high school level, you got to be able to stop the run and not many teams have been able to run on them. They have some great talent in the secondary and they do a great job of mixing up whether they are going to play man or zone.”On offense, the Raiders have been led by quarterback Dylan Prater, running back Cody Long and wide receiver Jalen Browder.“Offensively, they probably have the biggest O-line that we’ve seen this year,” Combs said. “The quarterback does a great job of running that offense, making the right reads. He is a nice spark. The running back runs really hard. People talk about the receiver and the others do a good job of playing assignment football.”The Cougars will counter with a well-balanced offense led by Baylor Whitfield (1,603 passing yards and 19 touchdowns), Justin Hall (908 receiving yards and eight TDs) and Daetrich Harrington (1,129 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns).“The quarterback slings the ball well,” Lindsey said. “The running back is tough. They are 6-1 for a reason. They are not a pushover football team. You don’t win as many games as they have and not be good at what you do. They got a great coaching staff. Kelby Watts is the defensive coordinator and I’ve known him for a long time. His kids are going to be in position to make a play.”Last week, Alexander beat Villa Rica 29-17 for its second win in a row.“Villa Rica is a good football team,” Combs said. “Their record does not show how good they are. We expected a fight all night and they definitely brought it but our guys expected to win so at no point did they get flustered. They just kept their composure and kept taking steps forward.”Last year, the Cougars left the field with a 32-29 win against the Raiders, notching their sixth win in the all-time series.“We didn’t finish in the fourth quarter so I’m just going to be telling the defense to finish every quarter because last year they beat us in the fourth quarter,” East Paulding linebacker Sonny Smith said. “They are a very good passing team.”“They play with confidence and we got to play with confidence ourselves and execute our game plan,” Lindsey said.
