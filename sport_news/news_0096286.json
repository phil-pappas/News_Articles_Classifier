But following a cost consolidation by Rutgers and a ticket increase by the NJSIAA, the games are going back to the Scarlet Knights’ home site.\nThe NJSIAA sought – as mandated by law – approval for the ticket price increase from the state Department of Education. The increase was approved – the original ticket prices of $5 for adults and $3 for students and seniors were increased to $8 for adults and $2 for students and seniors.\nAbout 60 percent of the tickets are purchased by students and seniors, according to the NJSIAA.\n“The new pricing structure will allow NJSIAA to stay at Rutgers this year, but does not allow us to attain projected revenues and make a long-term commitment to the venue,” Timko said. “We continue to work with the Commissioner of Education and with Senator [Raymond] Lesniak, who has been in discussions with all parties about keeping the games at Rutgers. We remain hopeful that we'll be able to transition from a net-loss to a more economically sustainable event.”\nThe state tournament starts on Feb. 29, with the Non-Public Group finals set for Rutgers on March 12 and the Public Group finals at Rutgers on March 13.\n--Staff report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:00:49.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
