(Douglas Miles / The Gazette) Most Popular Douglas Miles , The Gazette October 16, 2015 | 9:59 pm \nWEST BRANCH – For much of the past two seasons, West Branch football has leaned heavily on star tailback Luke Lenoch to power the offense. \nIn a Class 1A District 5 game Friday night at The Little Rose Bowl, the Bears flipped the script. \nQuarterback Cooper Koenig broke the school record for touchdown passes in a single game by halftime, and third-ranked West Branch steamrolled Wilton, 55-14. \n“It makes it tough for teams to prepare for us,” said Koenig, who finished the game 8-of-11 passing for 151 yards and five touchdowns. “If you’re going to try to take Luke away, then we have good enough skill guys to put the game in the air.” \nWilton stacked defenders up to the line of scrimmage early and forced Koenig to hurt them with the pass. The West Branch senior did, tossing four TD passes alone in the second quarter, including an eight-yard strike to Matt Shawver on the final play of the first half for a 35-7 lead. \n“They play a man defense,” Koenig said. “It’s tough to cover our guys with man because of how quick we’ve got guys.” \nShawver and Aaron Barnes each finished with a pair of touchdown receptions. Lenoch added two rushing scores in the second half and finished with a season-high 211 yards on the ground with 23 carries. The junior now has 1,336 yards this season and is tied for the Class 1A lead with 20 TDs. \nThe victory clinches at least a share of the district crown for West Branch (8-0, 5-0 District 5). \n“I think we had an idea of what they were going to do offensively and defensively,” West Branch Coach Butch Pedersen said. “Our game plan kind of played out that way and we’re extremely happy for these kids to win this championship.” \nWest Branch 55, Wilton 14 \nAT WEST BRANCH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:07:27.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
