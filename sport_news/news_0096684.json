(File/AP Photo/Mike Stewart) × CLEMSON – Four of the last five ACC Atlantic Division Championship games – otherwise known as Clemson-Florida State – have kicked off at night. Florida State won all four games beginning under a dark sky and bright lights. Clemson won the fifth, a late afternoon start in 2011. If that’s an omen: advantage, Tigers. The ACC announced Monday the 17th-ranked Seminoles will visit No. 3 Clemson in a game kicking off Nov. 7 at 3:30 p.m. and televised by either ABC, ESPN or ESPN2. Avoiding a nighttime kickoff eliminates competition for television networks going up against LSU-Alabama, which kicks off that same day at 7 p.m. on CBS. The last four years, the Clemson-Florida State winner went on to win the ACC Championship while edging the losing team in the final ACC standings either by one game or on a head-to-head tiebreaker. This year’s matchup is a bit different in that FSU was shocked Saturday night at Georgia Tech, thus ending the Seminoles’ 28-game ACC winning streak. However, FSU can still run the table going forward, including a win at Clemson, and represent the ACC Atlantic in the league title game Dec. 5 in Charlotte. Moving day There were some alterations to the Tigers’ depth chart released Monday entering Clemson’s game Saturday at N.C. State. Freshman quarterback Kelly Bryant is now tied with junior Nick Schuessler, a former walk-on, as the second-stringers behind sophomore Deshaun Watson. Bryant has completed 5 of 6 passes for 23 yards, but also scampered for two rushing touchdowns to punctuate Saturday’s 58-0 rout at Miami. “He’s earned the opportunity to get more reps and open the competition,” offensive coordinator Tony Elliott said. “By the time we get to the game Saturday, we’ll know who next guy would be to run out there.” Schuessler is 13-for-23 for 177 yards and has lost a couple of turnovers this year. Elsewhere, senior center Ryan Norton appears again on the depth chart as Jay Guillermo’s backup, having missed the last five games with a knee injury. And senior defensive tackle D.J. Reader, who left the team to address personal issues for the first six games, is now a third-string defensive tackle. Scott Pagano is once again a lone starter, with Christian Wilkins as his backup receiving similar game work. Alexander honor Cornerback Mackensie Alexander is one of 16 semifinalists for the Jim Thorpe Award honoring the best defensive back in the country. Alexander’s stats are low, due to teams refusing to challenge the redshirt sophomore. “I definitely feel like his play this year has been better (than last year,)” junior safety Jayron Kearse said. “He’s been shutting down one whole side of the field. I actually hate that I’m on that side of the field. His play has been outstanding, man.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:51:24.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
