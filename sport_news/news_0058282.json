The villagers were demonstrating against the Surankote police for allegedly beating up women during a raid late last night. Villagers from Potha in Surankote tehsil staged a protest here this morning against the police for allegedly beating up a few women during a raid last night. The protest continued for six hours. They raised slogans against the police and demanded immediate action against policemen for allegedly beating up women. “The police party last night raided one of the houses in Potha village and beat the women mercilessly. They said they were looking for a rape and murder accused who escaped from a police vehicle on way to Surankote on September 13 last month,” a protester said. “When the police did not find the accused, they started thrashing the residents, including women. They said the women had helped the criminal to escape,” the protester said. Sources said the accused, identified as Imtiyaz Ahmad, was being taken to be produced before a Magistrate when he managed to escape. The accused was in judicial custody. A case under Sections 376, 302 and 354 of the RPC was registered against the accused at the Surankote police station. The mob turned violent when Deputy Commissioner, Poonch, Nisar Ahmed Wani, along with SSP, Poonch, Jatinder Singh Johar, reached the spot to pacify the protesters. The protesters started pelting stones on the police and the officials. Five protesters and two policemen were hurt in the incident. The two policemen who suffered serious injuries were shifted to the GMC, Jammu, for treatment. However, Commander, 6 Sector RR, Brigadier RP Singh pacified the protesters for talks with the administration.
