The only man to win the World Series with a ninth-inning Game 7 home run watched for a moment as the ball sailed toward the left-field wall at Pittsburgh’s Forbes Field and then let his Louisville Slugger slip gently from his grasp onto the ground. \nMazeroski did not stand there admiring his swing but, rather, started running. The idea of the bat flip as personal punctuation was as foreign to baseball in 1960 as the designated hitter, free agency, interleague play and wild-card playoff teams. \nTimes change. Not always for the better. \nThe over-the-top, look-at-me posturing of Toronto slugger Jose Bautista following his tiebreaking homer in the decisive game of the American League Division Series can be read as a sign of changing sensibilities, clashing cultures and generational gaps. Or, more fundamentally, as a matter of good taste. \nIt has divided baseball fans into the buttoned-down “respect the game” camp and devotees of a more demonstrative, more exuberant playing style. Depending on your perspective, it either reflects the influence of Asian and Latino ballplayers in a sport widely seen as too staid and too bound by unwritten rules or the end of civilization as we know it. \nYou Can Say That Again is a staunch supporter of personal expression and spontaneity, but reflexively cringes when sports celebrations seem too choreographed or overly self-indulgent. When the Bengals’ Carlos Dunlap performed a sack dance with his team trailing by 17 points last Sunday against Seattle, he appeared to be both out of line and out of touch. (Yes, the Bengals came back to win the game. No, that doesn’t excuse Dunlap’s demonstration.) \nCompare that exhibition to the understated style of Louisville great Johnny Unitas, who watched Alan Ameche score the winning sudden-death touchdown in the 1958 NFL Championship game, then turned around and trotted back to the bench without so much as a fist pump. (Yeah, we know. Different era.) \nJoy is easily justified. An athlete who experiences a transcendent moment on a big stage is entitled to emote, to savor the accomplishment, to run the bases as did Carlton Fisk in 1975 or Kirk Gibson in 1988 or Joe Carter in 1993. But if you’re going to stand at home plate as if studying an oil painting and then make a big show of discarding your bat, you’re asking for an earful for showing up the pitcher. \nHere, we defer to the sense of decorum Crash Davis expressed when an opposing hitter lingered too long at home plate after going deep against Nuke LaLoosh in “Bull Durham”: \n“Run, dummy,” he said. Sullivan | When NCAA starts looking, look out \nThis week’s Top 10 sports quotes are somewhat less succinct: \n10. Urban Meyer, Ohio State football coach, alerting call-in audience: “I’d rather stick a rusty nail in my heel than have someone ask me about the quarterbacks.” (97.1 The Fan) \n9. Gregg Popovich, San Antonio Spurs, on the media-friendly style of Atlanta coach Mike Budenholzer: “I’m very disappointed in Bud’s courtesy and civility in those interviews. I’d like him to be much more curt, short and rude. Like me.” (San Antonio Express-News) \n8. Sammy Watkins, Buffalo Bills wide receiver, ​on feeling neglected: \"I need the ball at least 10 times – I need 10 targets – and l'll be fine with however many yards I get. And that's what I addressed in talking with my agent. We reached out to a couple people and tried to pull some string like, 'Hey, I need my targets. You came up to draft me, and I'm not getting targets – that's a problem.' You're making me look bad, and you're making yourself look bad. Why not make both of us look good?'\" (Buffalo News) \n7. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors guard, on suggestions his team was lucky to win NBA title: \"I apologize for us being healthy. I apologize for us playing who was in front of us. I apologize for all the accolades we received as a team and individually. I'm very, truly sorry, and we'll rectify that situation this year.\" (ESPN) \n6. Tom Izzo, Michigan State basketball coach, on calls to limit the hours college athletes spend on their sport: \"I think it's a joke. Are we going to limit time on Twitter? ... I don't see surgeons worrying about their time. I don't see musicians worrying about theirs. We give them more time, they get in trouble and then we get in trouble.\" (Big Ten media session) \n5. Larry Eustachy, Colorado State basketball coach, expressing opposition to players fouling out: \"When you go see Barbra Streisand, she's not fouling out at intermission.\" (Mountain West media session) \n4. Steve Spurrier, former South Carolina football coach, on how his age impacted recruiting: “I don’t act 70 or talk or look like it, but I am. It’s hard on recruiting. You can’t be 70 years old and go 4-8, 5-7. I definitely was a liability. It can get ugly. The more you lose, the uglier it gets.” (The State) \n3. John Calipari, University of Kentucky basketball coach, on golf's one-and-done phenomenon: ”Jordan Spieth ruined college golf. Now, he made $22 million as a 21-year old – really he made $50 million – and he chased his genius. His genius was hitting the white ball, having the mind and the courage to be able to do it with pressure, and he was able to get himself in one year in college and be the best golfer professionally in the world. I don't hear one word about that.” (Press conference) \n2. Terry Bradshaw, Hall of Fame quarterback, on the Dallas Cowboys signing Greg Hardy despite domestic violence conviction: \"Anybody, in my opinion, that lays a hand on a woman, I don't care who you are my friend, you never come back in this league. But Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, in his desperation to get a pass rusher, said, 'Well, you know what America, Cowboy fans, he's all right. He's a good boy. We're going to get him all straightened out over here and bring him in here.' Which he did.” (Fox Sports) \n1. Jim McElwain, University of Florida football coach, on LSU running back Leonard Fournette: \"I know I couldn't tackle him. Here's what I told our guys: 'Somebody jump on his back, maybe that will slow him down. Maybe somebody else grabs a shoelace and he trips.'\" (SEC teleconference) 16 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1RNB5tb TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:49:39.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
