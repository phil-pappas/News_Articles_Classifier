Most of it has been good, and good for the city, but a recent spate of arrests and increasingly erratic behavior have put him in a dramatically different kind of spotlight.\nRussell’s accomplishments are well-known. He co-founded Lebowski Fest, an annual event that has gone global with sister festivals in more than 30 cities. He opened WHY Louisville, a Kentucky-themed gift shop, at 1583 Bardstown Road, in 2005 and added a second location at 806 E. Market St. in 2013. And this year began with Russell deep into a project to open Funtown Mountain, a Cave City amusement park.\nAll of it has been threatened by a severe manic episode related to Russell’s bipolar disorder, a condition with which he has struggled since his teens, according to his father, Bill Russell. The manic episode began last year following a deep depression, and the 39-year-old's return to substance abuse after nearly 20 years of sobriety became apparent in July when he was first arrested on drug charges.\nWill Russell has now been arrested four times, with three involving public intoxication and possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia. His father said that drugs and alcohol have exacerbated his son’s condition but aren’t its cause. The real issue is what lies behind the headlines.\n“The mental illness is the problem,” Bill Russell said.\nWill Russell has long been open about his mental illness. He has gone on record repeatedly about overcoming issues associated with his condition and was vocal this year about electroconvulsive therapy he received in 2014. He told The Courier-Journal in January that he had a “mission to inspire people by being honest about my life and mental illness.”\nIn an interview from the Hart County Jail on Wednesday, Will Russell said he is only focused on getting out of jail and back to his businesses.\n“Currently, I’m on my meds and sober and going to meetings and seeing my doctor,” he said, “so things have been going very well. ... I’m still Will Russell. I’m still a good boss, a good father and a good citizen.”\nWHY Louisville and Lebowski Fest have been precariously kept afloat by a small group of supporters after longtime staffers resigned following months of personal and financial chaos. Both businesses are in trouble, and Funtown Mountain was shut down Sept. 8 by Cave City police for safety violations after a string of vandalism and looting, much of it allegedly instigated by Will Russell.\nBusiness at WHY Louisville has plummeted and there is no cash to replenish stock, said Katie Reid, a neighbor of Russell’s who has been helping manage the Bardstown Road WHY Louisville with her husband, Justin. Thousands of dollars of merchandise orders placed through Lebowski Fest’s website were going unfilled, said the festival’s former manager, Tyler Gill.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nWill Russell spray-paints WHY Louisville front\n'System doesn't seem to work' For Will Russell’s friends and supporters, it has been painful to watch. For many others, it has been a social media circus. For his family, it has been devastating.\nOn Sept. 17, Russell was arrested by the Louisville Metro Arson Bureau and charged with first-degree wanton endangerment after police say he set fire to his home in the 900 block of East Washington St. Two days later, he was charged by Horse Cave police with public intoxication, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a controlled substance not in the proper container, second-degree disorderly conduct and bribery of a public servant. His bond is $5,000, which Bill Russell said he would post only if his son voluntarily enters treatment.\nBill Russell has been endlessly frustrated by mental health and judiciary systems that aren’t designed to help his son. In July, he took out a mental inquest warrant that led to an arrest and a mandatory five days of hospitalization. The warrant's petitioner can request further hospitalizations for as long as the warrant is active, but with a maximum detention of 72 hours. Bill Russell has asked for two additional hospitalizations, but his son was released within hours after doctors determined he wasn’t a threat to himself or others.\n“The system doesn’t seem to work in this situation,” Bill Russell said. “The mental health people would be of great value if it wasn’t for the judicial system. The judicial system places individual freedom above common sense, in my opinion.”\nThe key issue in getting treatment has been Will Russell's unwillingness to commit himself into long-term care, his father said, and that has led to a cycle of arrest and release. That may be changing.\nAttorney Artie McLaughlin has met with Will and Bill Russell, and is representing Will Russell, who has agreed to a plan that is in its earliest stages. McLaughlin said that Russell's incarceration is complicating matters but they are in the process of researching facilities, doctors and getting insurance secured.\n\"The cycle has to be broken before he can even begin to address his legal and business issues,\" McLaughlin said. \"At this point I would characterize this as a medical investigation stage, followed by a treatment stage. ... We are in the last act of all of this. There is no second act coming, If this does not work, then he will jeapordize any credibility he has left.\"\nFamilies are frequently stymied by the “delicate balance between respecting someone’s civil rights and getting the help that a loved one so desperately needs,\" said Katharine Dobbins, CEO of Wellspring, a Louisville nonprofit mental health agency, and a board member of the Louisville chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\nShe said she supports a bill that is expected to be filed in the Kentucky General Assembly that would give families more options. It would create a circumstance where someone with mental illness, who must meet a specific set of criteria, could be ordered to seek treatment rather than have that decision be strictly voluntary.\n“When people are at that point where they have no insight (into their condition), and are potentially a danger to themselves or others but no longer meet the criteria for involuntary hospitalization, they could have court-ordered outpatient treatment,” Dobbins said.\n“It’s a way to provide a little more continuity of care. ... It’s excruciating to stand by and watch someone you love ... do great damage to themselves, those they care about and their professional life and career,\" she said.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nWill Russell's Funtown Mountain misses loan payment, shut down by Cave City officials\nWill as a visionary Will Russell's recent struggles are very similar to his chaotic teenage years, his father said. Bill Russell said that his son had a “normal childhood” but during his freshman year at the University of Dayton an episode of binge drinking sent him into a spiral. He went into a depression and then into a manic phase that led to homelessness, seven arrests in five states, frequent hospitalization and disability.\nHe was diagnosed as bipolar in 1996 and got sober after agreeing to go into treatment, Bill Russell said, and also cooperated during subsequent manic or depressive phases. By 2002 he was stable and that year founded Lebowski Fest with Scott Shuffitt to celebrate the movie \"The Big Lebowski.\" Shuffitt eventually sold his interest to Russell. As Lebowski Fest’s notoriety increased, Russell became one of Louisville’s most recognized businessmen and was nominated for an Ernest & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year award.\nLouisville’s Jason D’Mello, a visiting professor of entrepreneurship at Loyola Marymount University, said he asked Russell to visit a class he was teaching at the University of Louisville and judge a business plan students had crafted.\n“I remember listening to him speak about how he built both businesses and immediately recognized him as a visionary,” D’Mello said in an email. “... In our brief experience together, he came across as one of the most passionate entrepreneurs I have met in Louisville.”\nNo one disagrees, including former employees. Gill, 26, quit as Lebowski Fest manager in late August after what he said was an emotionally exhausting roller-coaster ride. The festival appears to be in stasis, he said, and when he recently checked his Lebowski Fest account, it was filled with unanswered emails from customers.\nThe pursuit of Funtown Mountain has left Russell in debt, Gill said, and that Lebowski Fest's bank account had a negative balance when he resigned.\n“All of the businesses are suffering, everyone is quitting,” Gill said. “I mean, none of us wanted to quit. We all care about Will. We care about the job, but it was getting to the point where we couldn’t stand by him, anymore. It was because at a certain point I feel like I was enabling him.\n“I’ve told him since then, ‘If you agree to get some help, become healthy again, I’ll come right back and help you get everything back on level ground,’ but he hasn’t responded to that. I don’t want to publicly bash him because he’s a good person. He’s inspired a lot of people to do a lot of really great things. There are a ton of people who care about him, and the people who come to Lebowski Fest are basically extended family.\n“I hate to see it all fall apart because he’s sick, and people need to understand that. He’s sick.”\n\"My real hope right now is to get him safe and try to get him help,\" Bill Russell said. \"If we can do that, we can find out what the new Will looks like.\"\nWill Russell is next due in Jefferson District Court in the wanton endangerment case on Monday.\nReporter Jeffrey Lee Puckett can be reached at (502) 582-4160 and jpuckett@courier-journal.com.\nPost by courierjournal .", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e43a13296cdd8ed617e450bb0811c6d11e5837d6/c=794-0-2957-2163/local/-/media/2015/09/10/Louisville/Louisville/635774715861881092-Why02-SAM.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/courierjournal/posts/10153026284431993", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e3f6089398978678eaab1b221a9ac4057f10417a/c=0-277-4010-2543&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/09/09/Louisville/Louisville/635773917744403299-FuntownMountain.jpg", "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1", "https://www.facebook.com/courierjournal"], "published": "2015-09-26T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:02:01.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
