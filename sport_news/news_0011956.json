Gayler was 46th in the race with a time of 22 minutes, 1 second. Posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 6:00 am Mustang boys survive regional BY GREG FLINT sports@dancomnews.com Commercial-News.com \nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The West Lafayette Harrison cross-country regional is one of the toughest in the state and, had they not known it before, the teams from the Wabash River Conference found out on Saturday. \nThe lone WRC team to advance was the boys’ squad from Fountain Central who were led by a 15th place finish from Ben Payton and a 19th place finish from Ben Petrzak. \nThe Mustang boys took fifth place, just two points behind Harrison, but 29 points ahead of sixth place Seeger who had edged them for the sectional title one week earlier. \n“We put everything together today,” said Fountain Central boys’ coach Michael Allio. “We had several PR’s [personal records] today.” \nFor Miles Stucky, the head coach of Seeger, it was a frustrating day as several of his runners struggled to post good times. \n“The girls’ did about as I had expected, but not the boys,” he said. “Everybody has a bad race now and then and for us, it was today.” \nStucky went on to explain what happened as he had seen it before. \n“We got lost in the crowd,” he said. “We’ve done this in big meets, where we are not at the front and have to work to gain positions. We just don’t know how to do that very well because we usually don’t have to [battle for position] around here.” \nSeeger did have one boy and one girls advance to the New Prairie Semi-state by finishing as one of the top 10 runners not on an advancing team. \nConner Million took eighth in a time of 16:25 (29 seconds behind the winner) while freshman Patrick Hennessey finished as the 11th runner on a non-advancing team, just three seconds shy of moving on. \nLea McKay was the girl who advanced for Seeger, as she took 30th in a personal best time of 21:16. \n“I had a good run today,” she said. “I got past three of the girls who beat me in the sectional. I kind of redeemed myself for how I ran last week.” \nSeeger ended ninth in the girls’ team competition while Fountain Central took tenth. The top finisher for the Mustangs was senior Hannah Gayler who ran in a time of 22:01. \nGirls’ coach Clint Burney said that three of his runners, Charis Trusty, Olivia Woodrow and Megan Johnson, all ran personal records with Johnson doing so in her last race as a senior. \nThe only other team in the area to have runners at the event was Attica. They had three boys, Andrew Caron, CJ Day and Tanner Henry who took 39th, 48th and 82nd respectively. \nRed Rambler senior Katherine Poston concluded her cross-country career with a 59th place finish in the girls’ race. \nReturning to just how tough this regional meet actually is, the top four boys teams were from the West Lafayette Sectional with Fountain Central fifth and Seeger sixth to lead the teams from the Benton Central Sectional. \nOn the girls’ side, positions one and three went to West Lafayette Sectional teams while, in the strongest showing in years by Benton Central Sectional teams, positions two, four and five went to Twin Lakes, Benton Central and North Montgomery. \nGreg Flint is a freelance writer/photographer for the Commercial-News.
