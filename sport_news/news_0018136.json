If you can bat to your game and be patient, take the odd calculated risk in your area, you can bat for long periods of time. \n\"We've got the master in our dressing room with (consultant coach) Mahela (Jayawardene) who is so good at doing it and he was like, 'you can do the whole day easy'. \n\"It's all you've got to do - keep batting your way. It was a slow day of Test cricket and we have to bat ourselves back into the game on a wicket like this and whether it will deteriorate or not I don't know but that's the style of sub-continent cricket.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:11:37.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
