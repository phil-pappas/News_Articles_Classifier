By Jan Skutch Four former Savannah-Chatham police officers on Thursday sued former police chief Willie Lovett and several of his cronies for allegedly seizing control of the department to “serve their own illicit purposes.”\nThe suit also alleges that current and former city and county managers ignored warnings against promoting Lovett and actively supported the resulting corruption.\nThe 73-page suit, filed in Chatham County Superior Court, accuses the defendants of violations of Georgia’s Racketeering Influences and Corrupt Organizations Act that included “infiltration of the (Chatham-Savannah) Counter Narcotics Team by corrupt officers.”\n“Defendants’ shared purpose for gaining control of the (department) was to exploit a public service for private gain,” the suit filed by attorney Will Claiborne alleges.\nOver a five-year period, defendants “engaged in an open and ongoing pattern of violation of state laws … to further their own criminal goals,” the suit said, including “repeatedly protecting criminal activity and by thwarting investigative efforts by honest police officers.”\nThe plaintiffs are:\n• Peter Delatorre, an advanced police officer until he “had no choice but to submit his resignation” in November 2012.\n• Michael Delatorre, an advanced police officer until he was removed from CNT in November 2013 and “had no choice but to submit his resignation.”\n• Robert von Loewenfeldt, a sergeant until he was forced to resign in March 2013 and move to another law enforcement agency.\n• Lawrence Harris, an advanced police officer who was forced to resign on Jan. 5. 2011.\nClaiborne earlier filed ante litem letters warning city and county officials of potential litigation.\nThe plaintiffs contend Lovett and others retaliated against them when they tried to end the corruption. They say they were denied promotions or choice assignments and eventually had to resign out of fear for their personal safety and possible retaliation by other officers.\nThey are seeking a jury trial and damages, in part stemming from Lovett’s actions that they say were an effort to force them to quit their jobs and eliminated any chance for promotion.\n“Threatening honest police officers was a foreseeable consequence of a scheme to operate a corrupt department,” the suit said.\nNamed defendants were:\n• Lovett, former police chief now serving a federal prison sentence for protecting a gambling operation\n• Pete Liakakis, former Chatham County Commission chairman\n• Russell Abolt, former Chatham County manager\n• Michael Brown, former city of Savannah manager\n• Juliette Tolbert, Savannah-Chatham assistant chief\n• Malik Khaalis, former police sergeant\n• Willet Williams, former star corporal\n• Floyd Sawyer, former Savannah police officer\n• James Williams, Willet’s brother and a former corrections officer at Georgia State Prison\n• Rodney Gerido, former police sergeant\n• Cedric Phillips, former police captain\n• Eric Henderson, former police sergeant\n• Greg Ramsey, police lieutenant\n• Henry “Hank” Wiley III, former director of the Savannah-Chatham internal affairs unit\n• Andre Oliver, former police lieutenant\nThe civil action contends the officials who were named as defendants were warned of Lovett’s corrupt activities but promoted him to police chief rather than take steps to end the corruption.\nBoth county and city managers “were key participants in the furtherance of the criminal activity,” the suit alleges. “Each manager had the opportunities to end the corruption, but rather than take steps to end the corruption, the managers aided and abetted and actively supported the corruption of SCMPD and CNT.”\nLovett was named police chief in April 2010 and retired on Sept. 27, 2013.\nHis retirement triggered investigations into the department and the terminations and retirements of a number of officers.\nLovett was convicted in November 2014 in federal court on charges of commercial gambling and conspiring with an admitted gambler and others to obstruct enforcement of criminal laws over a 13-year period.\nU.S. District Judge William T. Moore Jr. sentenced Lovett in February to 7.5 years in federal prison and fined him $40,000, calling Lovett “simply a corrupt police officer.”\nAccording to the suit, Lovett was hired by a committee that included Abolt, Brown, Liakakis and then-Savannah Mayor Otis Johnson.\nOn at least four occasions in 2009 and 2010, the suit alleges, police Maj. Mark Gerbino met with Liakakis at the Olympia Café and told him Lovett was “engaged in corrupt activities.”\n“With knowledge of the ongoing corruption of Lovett, (Liakakis) took the substantial step to aid and assist in ongoing corruption by promoting Lovett to police chief,” the suit said.\nAbolt was similarly warned both by a group of high ranking police officers and later by Gerbino that Lovett was corrupt, but took no action to remove Lovett and, in fact, alerted Lovett to a memo from CNT Director Roy Harris regarding the activities of Khaalis and Willet Williams, the suit said.\nIn addition, former police chief Michael Berkow, Lovett’s predecessor, on several occasions asked Brown for permission to fire Lovett “due to suspicions of corruption” but was told “elected officials in the city of Savannah protected” Lovett and refused Berkow’s request, the suit alleges.\nThe suit also alleges that Tolbert, in her role as a police major, “assisted defendant Lovett in intimidating and punishing plaintiffs Peter Delatorre, Michael Delatorre and Lawrence Harris in retaliation for investigating corruption and to influence and/or intimidate those plaintiffs into silence about the corruption they uncovered.” .\nAnd Tolbert “imperiled the physical safety and emotional well being” of the Delatorres and Harris by refusing to take action after they met with her in October 2010, the suit said.\nTolbert also allegedly failed to take any action in 2010 after “she admitted to plaintiff von Loewenfeldt that she knew defendant Lovett’s actions against (him) were unfair, unethical and illegal,” the suit said.\nCedric Phillips, whom Lovett promoted to captain in February 2012 despite his having shoved a citizen, was assigned the following February as the sole officer in a newly formed drug unit, the suit said.\nPhillips, who resigned during the department’s internal affairs investigation after Lovett’s retirement, was described by a federal prosecutor at Lovett’s trial as his “crony, his henchman,” the suit alleges.\nAn FBI undercover informant presented a taped conversation played at Lovett’s trial in which Lovett can be heard reassuring Randall “Red” Roach, owner and operator of an illegal gambling outfit and Lovett’s co-defendant, that help was on the way, the suit said.\n“I’ve got Capt. Phillips on is way out there … He’ll get there shortly.”\nWhen Phillips arrived, no one was arrested.\nFrom Jan. 1. 2005, until plaintiff von Loewenfeldt was constructively discharged in March 2013, von Loewenfeldt “vocally questioned” Phillips’ actions as being “against department policy and in furtherance of a criminal enterprise,” the suit alleges.\nThe suit also alleges that Eric Henderson, a former police sergeant who was responsible for managing the Tactical Reaction and Prevention Unit, used unmarked TRAP vehicles to “distribute multiple ounces of powder and crack cocaine on Savannah’s westside and to protect drug dealers (there) from arrest.”\nA confidential informant later told Michael Delatorre that “Henderson was a major drug dealer on Savannah’s westside,” the suit states.\nCNT Director Everett Reagan, after hearing that information, told Delatorre he would not investigate the informant’s claims “because political friction with Lovett, the result of investigating corrupt SCMPD officers led to Reagan’s predecessor, Roy Harris, to resign his post (with CNT),” the suit said.\nHarris testified at Khaalis’s trial in August the he resigned because Lovett ”gutted” CNT in late 2010 and removed experienced department officer, replacing them with his “stooges,” the suit said.\n“It appeared to me that Chief Lovett was willing to destroy that (CNT) to get back at me because he was mad at me for investigating his officers without his knowledge,” Harris testified, according to the suit.\nThe suit contends Lovett predicated his decisions on promotions “upon personal loyalty to him.”\nThe civil action also alleges that Lovett installed Henry “Hank” Wiley III as head of the department’s internal affairs unit in June 2010 “in order to manipulate and control the internal affairs investigation into defendants Willet Williams and Khaalis.”\n“Wiley was known to be an officer who was loyal to Lovett and participated in Lovett’s corruption,” the suit said.\nOn Nov. 16, 2010, Lovett instructed Wiley to prepare a report clearing Willet Williams and Khaalis “of any allegations of wrongdoing,” the suit alleges.\nLovett also ordered Wiley to include in Khaalis’ internal affairs report that the city of Savannah attorney’s office reviewed the report and found no evidence of illegal activity by Khaalis,” the suit states.\nThat statement “was false and known to be false by both defendant Lovett and Wiley,” the suit said.\nThe Khaalis-Williams probe:\nIn the case of former police sergeant Malik Khaalis, the suit said he joined the force on Jan. 10, 2000, and was assigned to CNT “as early as 2004” as a narcotics agent.\nKhaalis “used his position as a narcotics agent to protect individuals who participated in the trafficking of illegal drugs. …(He) personally benefited from the assistance he provided to drug traffickers,” the suit said.\nJames Williams worked as a corrections officer at Coastal State Prison from June 1999 to September 2007, and after working for the Georgia Ports Authority, returned to Coastal until June 2010, the suit alleges.\nIn June 2008, CNT agent Michael Delatorre arrested a man for drug possession and that man agreed to work for CNT as a confidential informant, the suit said.\nWhile incarcerated at the prison the informant learned that Williams was working with a former drug supplier to “smuggle multiple kilograms of cocaine into the prison by placing the drugs in the bottom of cans of paint,” the suit said.\nThe informant identified James Williams as having sold the supplier cocaine on two occasions in early 2008, both times at Williams’ home, and that the informant and supplier “were escorted home by corrupt SCMPD officers driving marked police vehicles after purchasing the drugs,” the suit said.\nFloyd Sawyer was identified by the informant from a photo lineup “on or about February 2009, as a metro police officer who was present in a marked police car with Willet Williams “during the second of the two 2008 drug buys at defendant James Williams’ home,” the suit said.\nSawyer was fired in June 2011 for appearing in a rap video in a ski mask “slamming a man against his SCMPD squad car... then taking the man’s money from his pocket,” the suit said.\nSawyer was convicted in federal court in 2012 in an extortion scheme for taking a cell phone and drugs from an undercover agent posing as a drug dealer at a downtown nightspot while working off-duty security in police uniform and wearing his department-issued weapon.\nIn January 2009, CNT searched James Williams’ cell phone records from Oct. 8, 2008, and Nov. 28, 2008, and found eight convicted drug dealers had connected to the cell phone, the suit said.\nThe same informant told Delatorre that Williams had a brother, Willet Williams, who was on the police force, the suit said.\n“Defendant Willet Williams used his position at SCMPD, including access to marked police units, to participate in drug trafficking operations in Chatham County for his own benefit,” the suit said.\nThe informant identified Willet Williams as providing the police escorts in marked police units after drug sales at James Williams’ home, the suit said.\nThe informant also identified Willet Williams “as a member of a criminal organization that included multiple SCMPD officers and individuals within local government” in drug sales, the suit said.\nThe informant said the “criminal organization was comprised of SCMPD officers who had not been arrested during the Savannah 11 investigation,” by the FBI from 1994-1997. the suit said.\nThat probe resulted in 11 Savannah police officers being convicted of federal corruption, drug and gun charges, the suit said.\nSubsequent CNT and federal Drug Enforcement Administration probes revealed Khaalis made contact with subjects of a wire tap using his personal phone and a CNT phone, the suit said.\nWhen repeated efforts to monitor the phone lines of suspected high-level drug dealer Joshua Varner were unsuccessful, drug agents suspected Khaalis’s involvement, the suit said.\nIn July 2009, DEA agents instructed Peter Delatorre to tell Khaalis the “investigation (into defendants James Williams and Willet Williams) was over,” the suit said.\nWiley briefed Lovett on July 27, 2010, on the Khaalis and Williams matter, and Lovett instructed Wiley to take Khaalis off administrative leave and return him to active duty, the suit said.\nWhen asked by CNT director Roy Harris whether there was a pending Investigation of Khaalis, Wiley and Lt. Oliver told him no investigation was pending, the suit said.\n“This statement was false, was given with the intent to deter proper law enforcement investigations of defendant Khaalis,” the suit said.\nOn Sept. 10, 2010, Harris, along with federal law enforcement individuals, informed Lovett of the Delatorres’ investigation within CNT and its implications for Khaalis.\n“Lovett made a false statement to Roy Harris … to wit: “I have never seen the internal affairs memo on Malik Khaalis,” the suit said.\nOn Oct. 29, 2010, Chatham County Attorney Jonathan Hart, at Abolt’s direction, hand delivered the Harris memo and report to Lovett, the suit said.\n“On or about Oct. 29, 2010, defendant Lovett, in Chatham County, did knowingly intimidate Peter Delatorre Michael Delatorre, Lawrence Harris and other SCMPD employees by ordering the transfer of officers out of CNT, with the intent to hinder or delay the communication of information related to the commission of a criminal offense to other law enforcement offices’ investigation of corruption within CNT,” the suit said.\nWhile on subsequent administrative leave, Khaalis was allowed to sit for the police department’s sergeant’s test and was promoted by Lovett. Both Delatorre brothers and von Loewenfeldt were eligible for promotion but were passed over, the suit said.\nKhaalis was indicted on Jan. 22, 2014, by the Chatham County grand jury for making false statements and violation of his oath as a public officer.\nHis first trial in July ended in a mistrial after three key pieces of evidence suddenly appeared in court. He’s scheduled for a retrial in Chatham County Superior Court on Oct. 12. He has pleaded not guilty.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/491901622_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/491901622_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:58:02.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
