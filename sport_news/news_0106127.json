The foundation runs the Sports Legends and Babe Ruth birthplace museums. \nGibbons says the one-year lease proposal by the stadium authority wasn’t a financially viable option for them. \nThe museum featured exhibits of the Orioles, the Ravens and Baltimore icons such as Johnny Unitas. \nMichael Frenz, executive director of the stadium authority, says the state is looking for interested developers to move into the space. \n___ \nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:26:32.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
