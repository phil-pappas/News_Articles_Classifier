He has been substituted into the lineup during parts of regular season games, including last Sunday while Armstead was temporarily sidelined. He has also lined up as a blocking tight end in certain situations. \nPeat, whose father is a former NFL offensive lineman, says he has been working extra on his own to be prepared and is excited about the prospect of making his first NFL start. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:21:19.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
