Doc Rivers says the Warriors got lucky they didn't face the Clippers or Spurs during the playoff run. James Harden believes he deserves the MVP award over Stephen Curry . Everybody seems to be saying the Warriors' health was a fortuitous event all season long. And now we may have one more.\nRockets ' center went on Texans Radio this week and informed everybody he had two knee injuries during the Western Conference finals. He says he had a torn MCL and a meniscus tear when the Rockets faced the Warriors. Calvin Watkins reports the injuries weren't severe enough to require surgery in the offseason after the Rockets were eliminated.\nDwight Howard just told us on Texans Radio that he played through a torn MCL and meniscus during the WCF vs the Warriors\n— Mike Meltser (@MikeMeltser) October 8, 2015 Source: Dwight Howard's knee issues, torn MCL and meniscus during WCF weren't severe enough where offseason surgery was needed.\n— Calvin Watkins (@calvinwatkins) October 9, 2015 It's odd we're just now hearing about this. We didn't know it at the time of the postseason and we didn't even hear about it during Rockets media day. But maybe they were just minor enough to not need mentioning until now?\nHoward played in all five games of the conference finals, totalling 175 minutes on the floor and 65 minutes on the bench. When the Rockets had their big man on the floor, it was certainly more of competition between the two teams. The Rockets were outscored by 2.4 points per 100 possessions with Howard in the game. That was the second best mark on the team during that series behind James Harden.\nWith Howard on the bench, the Rockets were destroyed by 22.6 points per 100 possessions. Perhaps a healthy Howard would've been able to stay on the court a bit more and even put the Rockets in a positive position when he was playing. During the regular season, Howard played just 59 minutes in two games against the Warriors and the results were reversed. Houston was demolished by 35 points per 100 possessions with Howard on the court, minus-4.3 per 100 with him not in the game. Dwight Howard apparently had a big knee injury.
