(WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Matt Jones shares his thoughts on the talent level among the state's high school football players. \nI’m Matt Jones and it’s time for Overtime. \nKentucky high school football has always been something that fans are passionate about, but it hasn't always produced the best talent. \nOne of the problems the UK football program has had over the years is that the state of Kentucky doesn't produce a ton of Division 1 players. Well, that is not true this year. \nIt's likely the case that this is the best group of talent to come out of Kentucky in the last 20 years. Kash Daniel from Paintsville, Drake Jackson from Woodford County, Landon Young from Lafayette, Davonte Robinson from Henry Clay and others, have made up what I think is the best class we've seen in at least a generation. \nPart of what this is doing is making Mark Stoops' job easier at the UK level. Now he doesn't have to worry as much about going out of state and finding other players. He's getting a good base right here in the state. It's at positions that are hard to find - specifically the offensive line. \nFinding offensive line guys throughout the country is difficult and the state of Kentucky is producing them. \nAs you go out and watch games in the next week or weeks to come, remember, you are seeing the best high school talent this state has seen in a long time and you should be happy. \nI'm Matt Jones, this has been Overtime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:56:21.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
