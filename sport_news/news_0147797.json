It was the 30th career marathon win for the former Addison High School standout. \nThe women’s winner in 2:55:01.51 was Molly Nunn, from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who was making her return to marathons after she was sidelined by knee surgery. She also won the race in 2011, the same year Morseman earned his first Wineglass victory. Wineglass Marathon brings cheers \nTheir triumphs highlighted the biggest race weekend in Wineglass history. The field for the full marathon included 2,700 runners, with another 3,100 registered for the half. Both races finished in Corning, with fans lining Market Street to cheer the runners as they finished. Half marathon runners started out in Campbell, about 30 minutes before the full marathoners took off from Bath. \nCorning’s Matthew Wilbur won the men’s half marathon in 1:12:50.80 and Marina Orrson of Shavertown, Pennsylvania took the women’s half marathon in a course record of 1:19.91. Julianne Quinn's old women’s mark of 1:20:02 had stood since 2012. Wineglass Marathon results \nOn Saturday, Mike McManus won the Wineglass Corelle 5K in Corning with a time of 15:57.45. Brooke Adams was the women's winner in 17:59.43. \nMorseman, 30, ran in front of a large group of family and friends, including his 1 ½-year old son Leeim. Leeim was diagnosed with spina bifida, a developmental congenital disorder in which the spinal cord fails to develop properly, while in the womb. Morseman and his wife, Sarah, also have a 3-year-old son, Alden. \n“It kind of means more to lace up the shoes every day to go out there,” Morseman said, talking of his son’s illness. “You never know. It could happen to anybody. My wife’s very athletic, I’m obviously very athletic. It’s just one thing God gives you and you’ve got to do the best you can with it. And I just hope that I can inspire other people and other families to go out there and do the same thing, even if they have a kid with special needs or who might not be able to walk. Just keep going.” Buy Photo \nBryan Morseman passes the water station near mile marker four in the Wineglass Marathon.

Being blessed every day to do what I’m able to do, and being as good as I am at it, just propels me to be the best that I can be and be a great father and husband.” \nWhile he has run with many supporters in his corner, Morseman actually spent much of Sunday’s race by himself physically. The only minor disappointment was falling short of the course record of 2:22:52 set in 1997 by Andrew Herr. Windy conditions on an otherwise ideal running day slowed Morseman a bit. \n“Today was very nice. I wanted the course record,” Morseman said. “I came up just shy again, but doing all the work myself and still running that time, that’s very impressive.” Buy Photo Wineglass Marathon runners grab water and Gatorade from a station near mile marker four.
