The Lady Apaches won the 4A-4 District championship, a boys singles championship and a girls singles championship.Boys SinglesKyle Hudson handily won the district title after defeating Aaron Hebert (Subiaco) 6-0, 6-0, Elliot Doxsee (Shiloh Christian) 6-0, 6-2 and Adam Treece (Shiloh Christian) 6-0, 6-1.Hudson and his brother won the Class 4A State doubles title last year.“Kyle had to adjust his game after his brother tore his ACL and could not compete this season,” Pottsville head coach Keri McAlister said. “Kyle is such a versatile player. His transition from doubles to singles was seamless. Kyle was undefeated in our conference. His work ethic is unmatched. He is a top notch competitor and one of the best in the state.”Ethan Aylesworth defeated Connor MacKenzie (Subiaco) 6-2, 6-4, but lost to Adam Treece 6-1, 7-6. Aylesworth lost to Elliot Doxsee in the third-place game 3-8.“Ethan is a great player and teammate,” McAlister said. “He has improved by leaps and bounds and just fell a little short. I have seen him mature so much as a player and get so much more mentally tough this year. I have no doubt he will progress and improve, and you will see him at state next year.”Boys DoublesThe Apaches team of Braxton Fields and Noah Robbins placed third in boys doubles.Fields/Robbins defeated Laduc/Mitchell from Prairie Grove in a marathon of a match, 5-7,6-1,6-2. Ney/Hudson from Shiloh Christian (eventual champs) defeated Fields/Robbins, 6-0,6-1. Fields/Robbins defeated Vonbechmann/Tune from Shiloh Christian 8-2 for 3rd place and trip to state.“Braxton and Noah had a very exhausting win over Subiaco in three sets and immediately had to play Shiloh Christian and lost badly,” McAlister said. “Most teams would have gave up and called it a day, but not these boys.“They were physically tired, mentally drained, and their confidence was low. They made a decision and that decision was to win the next one and as seniors to do something they had yet to do, which was go to state. The resolve I saw in that next match was inspiring. I admire them so much for overcoming adversity, picking themselves up and taking that match with a fierceness I have never seen from them. They simply stepped up and got the job done.”Caleb Moore and Dalen Daves lost to Eveld and Halter 6-1, 6-2.Girls SinglesAbbie Cormier took the 4A-4 District titles in a match against teamate Celeste Parker. Cormier took down Parker 6-4, 6-6, 7-0 in a tiebreak set.“I could not be more proud of both these girls and how well they played, not just today, but all season long,” McAlister said. “Abbie was plagued with injury last season and had to sit out all last year. This setback only fueled her desire to play and be the best she could be. Celeste and Abbie were on fire this year. They have constantly pushed each other and both of their games have elevated as a result. They have a strong desire to win and are highly competitive, but at the end of the match, they are teammates — very mature, supportive teammates who see the big picture and are going to state together.”Girls DoublesPottsville placed second and third in girls doubles. Erin Heikes and Mariah Prock were 4A-4 District runners-up. Cara Monk and Kaelyn Pearson placed third. Heikes/Prock defeated Antuna/Townes from Shiloh Christain, 6-0, 6-1. Heikes/Prock defeated Parsons/Whitten from Dardanelle, 6-3, 6-1. Cobb/Cobb from Shiloh Christian defeated Heikes/Prock in the finals, 6-2,6-3. Monk/Pearson defeated Williams/Kameron from Mena, 6-0, 6-1. Cobb/Cobb (eventual champs) defeated Monk/Pearson, 6-0, 6-2. Monk/Pearson then defeated Parsons/Whitten from Dardanelle for third place and a trip to state, 8-5.“Erin and Mariah have been playing together since July sometimes four-plus hours of tennis per day,” McAlister said. “All their hard work and determination cultivated a season of great improvement. They have been on a journey together for three months to be the very best tennis players that they can be for themselves and each other. They are so consistent and have always been committed to doing the little things right, devoted to the fundamentals. What a joy it has been to watch that evolution.”Heikes/Prock defeated Antuna/Townes from Shiloh Christain, 6-0,6-1. Heikes/Prock defeated Parsons/Whitten from Dardanelle, 6-3, 6-1. Cobb/Cobb from Shiloh Christian defeated Heikes/Prock in the finals, 6-2, 6-3“Cara Monk and Kaelyn Pearson are the pure definition of an effective doubles team,” McAlister said. “They have always strived to better, to get their game to the next level. They are students of the game. They disect their wins and losses and come to practice the next day ready to tackle their mistakes and improve.They communicate and encourage on every point.”The Class 4A State Tournament will be on Oct. 19-20 in Jonesboro.
