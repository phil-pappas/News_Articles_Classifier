The workers, mostly men, were followed for an average of 27 years.\nThe estimated death rate from all cancers other than leukemia increased with cumulative dose by 48 percent per gray (Gy). This suggests that about 209 of the 19,064 cancer-related deaths (other than leukemia) among the workers were associated with low-level radiation exposure, the researchers said.\nThey noted that the risk per unit dose was similar to that seen in Japanese atomic bomb survivors. This challenges the belief that high-dose rate exposures are more dangerous than low-dose rate exposures, they said.\nHowever, the study doesn't actually prove a cause-and-effect relationship between cancer and the workers' exposure to low-level radiation. Others factors, such as smoking and occupational asbestos exposure, may have influenced the results, the researchers say.\n Scientific Research Nuclear Disasters Cancer Leukemia", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627d08f/turbine/sc-nuclear-plant-cancer-health-1021-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-21T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:25:49.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
