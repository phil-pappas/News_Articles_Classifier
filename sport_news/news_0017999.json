He’s not awed by the bright lights or who he is guarding, so I think who they are personally and their ages and maturity level puts them at a different level.” \nBut it’s more than that. \n“And their skill level too,” Casey said. “They are both NBA-ready players. It’s just going to be things presented to them in a game that they probably haven’t seen before. The speed of the game is one example. I was talking to Delon the other day about how NBA players change speed. They can go from zero to 100 in a split second and he has to get used to that. Once he does that, that’s when the sky is the limit for him.” \nWright also has the advantage of an older brother who has been through just about everything in the NBA that Delon will eventually experience. Dorell Wright has been giving his younger sibling advice for years but surprised his little brother with an open letter to him in The Players’ Tribune, a new media platform that presents a medium for the direct reflections, thoughts and experiences of professional athletes. \nDelon only got a quick read of the letter on the way to Day 2 of training camp Wednesday morning but he saw enough of it, and admittedly had heard a lot of it already, to appreciate what his big brother was trying to do for him. \nThe letter was basically a what to avoid and what to do to become a solid professional. \n“I liked it, I liked it,” Delon said smiling. “Most of it I heard already, some of it he told me directly and it’s just stuff he went through. He told me what to worry about … it was a nice piece for everyone to see. It surprised me, I thought it was just another article with my brother and a reporter, I didn’t know it was a whole letter.” \nIf there’s one thing we’ve learned about Casey in his four years as head coach it is that he doesn’t just hand opportunities to rookies. If you play for Dwane Casey, you play because you have earned that playing time. You play because you make the team better. \nDon’t expect that to change any time soon. Whatever minutes Wright and Powell play this year will have been earned. \n“Both guys are working hard, they worked their behinds off this summer,” Casey said. “We are expecting really good things out of them, but first couple of days neither is lost, like deer in the headlights lost. They still have some things to learn but the effort an focus and concentration is there.” \nIt was not that long ago, even within the calendar year, that Powell and Wright were trash talking one another and doing whatever it took to get the other off his game. \nPowell was the leading scorer with UCLA. Wright was the starting point guard and leader with the University of Utah. They saw a lot of each other and battled each other every time they did. Those battles are over and now the two will battle together to make their way in the NBA. \n“With me and Delon it’s kind of funny because we used to really go at each other in college, especially being PAC 12 top players in our conference,” Powell said Wednesday. “We used to have duels and battles and we still talk about that and the little things we would say to each other in games. It’s always fun to have another rookie going through it with you, going through the hazing and having to carry (the vets) bags and we’ve grown a lot closer and we’re really good friends now and been able to enjoy the ride together.” \nBoth players and their head coach will tell you there remains plenty to learn. There are bound to be some bumps along the way but a solid foundation has already been laid. \nMORE HAZING TO COME \nAs two rookies expected to stick with the team, Delon Wright and Norman Powell know they will be targets. \nIn fact the rookie hazing has already started. \nOn the way out to Vancouver DeMar DeRozan, who just happens to be one of Powell’s favourite players, handed off a lunch bag he was taking on the plane with him and insisted Powell carry it for him. \n“We haven’t had to wear any pink bags yet, but it’s just getting started,” Powell said. “It’s just little things like that. Carry bags and getting the vets water when they ask. But I know it will pick up once the season starts.” \nPowell, though, said those little chores are nothing when he considers how quickly the rookies have been welcomed into the Raptor family. \n“DeMar was one of my favourite players growing up and he has taken me under his wing,” Powell said. “Before I even got drafted when I was working out for the Raptors in my pre-draft (James Johnson) was there talking with me and hooking me up with a pair of shoes. \n“I think it’s a good situation because I know the guys. DeMarre Carroll knows Tony Parker on UCLA (that’s Virgil Anthony Parker not to be confused with the Spurs French star by the same name) and me and him have talked. Cory knows Kyle Anderson (another UCLA alum) so everyone is connected and everyone has been real cool welcoming me to the team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:24:38.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
