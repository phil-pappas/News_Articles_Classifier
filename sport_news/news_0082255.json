WALKERAP Sports Writer \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Craig Smith had a power-play goal as the Nashville Predators scored twice in the first period Thursday night and held off the Carolina Hurricanes 2-1 in the season opener for both. \nViktor Arvidsson scored the first goal of his NHL career, and Seth Jones had two assists in the first period. Nashville improved to 4-1-1 in its last six season openers. \nGoalie Pekka Rinne, a three-time Vezina Trophy finalist, missed his first shutout of Carolina when Eric Staal scored with 1:40 left. Rinne made 25 saves for the win. \nDefenseman Noah Hanifin, the fifth overall pick by Carolina in June, made his NHL debut. The Hurricanes lost defenseman James Wisniewski, one of their offseason additions, early to a lower-body injury, and he did not return. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
