Oct. 19: San Jose Sharks at New York Rangers (7 p.m. ET; NHLN-US, TVAS, SNI1, CSN-CA, MSG) The Sharks suffered their first loss of the season on Saturday, a 6–3 defeat by the Islanders in Brooklyn, and will look to get back on track against the Blueshirts with No. 1 goalie Martin Jones between the pipes. One of the biggest question marks coming into the season, Jones has keyed San Jose’s hot start, going 4-0-0 with a 0.49 goals-against average and .982 save percentage. He also established a franchise shutout streak (234:33) that, as our own Alex Prewitt noted , is longer than the extended edition of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (223:00).\nJones’s steadiness will be key as the Sharks battle a swarm of early injuries. Logan Couture (broken leg) is out. Joonas Donskoi, Paul Martin and Ben Smith are questionable. Nikolay Goldobin, who stepped onto the top line to replace Donskoi, is one to watch.\nThe Rangers will look to end a three-game losing skid during which they’ve scored only two goals. Their power play, which has clicked just once in 16 tries this season, is a particular source of concern.\n• Tues. Oct. 20: New York Islanders at Columbus Blues Jackets (7 p.m. ET; MSG+, FS-O)\nNHL Claude Julien, Darryl Sutter favorites to be first coaches fired by Allan Muir", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@almuirSI"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:41:26.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
