He limped straight to the locker room, did not return and was on crutches, wearing a boot over his left foot after the game. \nHe has 11 catches for 167 yards and one TD this season. \nDorsett, who initially said it was an ankle injury, remains hopeful of a return later this season. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:47:43.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
