It was Parent's Night/Senior Night, and head coach Marley Melbye was profuse in her praise of this year's senior class. \"The Senior girls Marietta Geist, Haley Roed, Sierra Pry and Alison Olson are four girls that will be hard to replace, they bring such a spirit, determination and passion for their swimming career, their teammates success and also the team,\" Melbye said. \"They have made a gigantic impact and footprint on our team that will be hard to replace in the coming seasons. These girls have dedicated themselves to helping everyone on our team whether it is with stroke technique, leading by example, learning sportsmanship, help with homework or learning where to go in the school on their first day at the high school. The have really prided themselves on representing the Crookston High School in the most positive way they know how. I am both excited to see them perform at the end of the season and reach their highest of potential, but I also dread the day they get out of water for the last time in their high school career as a Pirate Swimmer. They will always have a special spot in both our hearts and on this team as they move on to the next chapter still representing and motivating their teammates to be the best people they can be.\" The Pirates won the next ten events (there were no JV or diving events), and often did so by significant time margins. When all was said and done, the score was Crookston 108 Fosston 62. The Pirates once again got strong results from their top guns (four first-place finishes apiece from Marietta Geist, Kate MacGregor, and Haley Roed, while Merran Dingmann had two and Sierra Pry and Thea Oman had one each), but had great effort top-to-bottom. There were six events in which the Pirates took the top two spots, and in the 200 M IM, the Pirates took an incredible top three, as Merran Dingmann won, Thea Oman took second, and Elizabeth Erdman took third. The dual was a prelude to the Fosston-Bagley Invitational that will take place in Fosston on Saturday, with a few more teams for the Pirates to face off against. The Pirates have performed very well this season, and will look to continue their success as their season moves along. The action is due to start at noon in Fosston Saturday.
