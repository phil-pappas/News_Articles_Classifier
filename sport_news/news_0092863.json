This was no small statement for the former Rogers and University of Rhode Island football standout, who has made a career in the game he loves. Watterson hasn’t missed a day since becoming an assistant trainer for the Philadelphia Eagles in 1984, a span of more than three decades. He’s spent the last 30 years prowling the sidelines as the head strength and conditioning coach with the Tennessee Titans franchise, and nothing has ever kept him from reporting as scheduled. Six children – sons Brock, Cole and Caden and daughters Kelsea, Bergen and Dottie – have been born and raised by Watterson and his wife, Heidi. There have been coaching changes, ice storms and multiple surgeries – three on the same day in May of this year, repairing the meniscus in each knee and his torn right rotator cuff. And still Watterson perseveres, working in a National Football League that bears little resemblance to the one where he found his start. “In my eyes I’m still between 22 and 35,” said Watterson, who will turn 59 in late November. “Every year, the old ones leave and the new ones come in. They get recycled, they come back and I’m like, ‘Wow, did you get old.’ “I don’t see that with me because I’m always with that age. The mentality is still that young man’s mentality. I don’t mind relating to that.” An honor from his alma mater was enough for Watterson to finally relent and put himself first. He returned to URI last weekend to accept a Deans Award at the school’s 10th annual Distinguished Achievement Awards & Gala ceremonies, held at the Newport Marriott. The event coincides with the Rams’ Homecoming festivities, and it was an occasion Watterson decided he simply couldn’t miss. “It was the first day I ever took off,” Watterson said. “That was a little awkward for me to even consider not being here.” Watterson arrived in Rhode Island late Thursday night and spoke to a couple of classes on Friday morning. His message for them included his two primary areas of focus in his day-to-day routine – maintaining a strong work ethic and consistently attempting to grow professionally. The attention to detail is partly inherited – Watterson’s father instilled strong values from an early age. One of his favorite sayings is still repeated on command by Watterson to this day. “‘I don’t care if you’re flipping burgers or washing dishes,” Watterson said. “‘Do your best and give everything you have, because that’s the mission. It’s not always about the goal. It’s about the actual process and the mission.’” Page 2 of 3 - That leads into the second of Watterson’s basic tenets. He rises at 4 a.m. every morning and reads for an hour, usually reviewing some scripture. His second hour of daily reading comes later and is meant to challenge or enhance the methods he employs with his players. “Things that men and women athletes were doing back in the 1800s are back in vogue,” Watterson said. “Functional training, kettle bell training, suspension training – we didn’t invent these things. These were done years ago.” Watterson’s starting center with the Eagles, Guy Morriss, was listed at 253 pounds. No current Tennessee lineman weights under 310, as the size and strength of his athletes has gradually increased over time. Former Titans’ defensive end Jevon Kearse – a 6-foot-4, 265-pounder known as The Freak who made three Pro Bowls from 1999-2001 – was the prime example of how players have evolved from the start of Watterson’s career to this point. “I don’t have a guy on this team, a defensive end, that couldn’t run faster than my fastest running back in ’84, ’85,” Watterson said. “Everything has become so streamlined, so position-specific – the length of your arm, the size of your hand.” Watterson was hired by the Titans when they were still the Houston Oilers, led by the brash Jerry Glanville. He was the first of five head coaches Watterson has served under during his tenure, including 17 years with Jeff Fisher from 1994-2010. “You’re only as good as the guys you work for, and I’m not saying that in the patronizing sense,” Watterson said. “I’ve been the beneficiary of some very tolerant, very understanding, very appreciative head coaches.” Watterson’s relationship with Fisher endures to this day, as evidenced by what transpired after an Aug. 23 preseason game when Fisher’s St. Louis Rams visited the Titans at Nissan Stadium. Watterson reported to the team parking lot to discover the tires on his truck were missing, a prank played by Fisher and some of his assistants. Watterson instructed stadium officials to prevent the St. Louis team buses from leaving until the tires were returned, and order was eventually restored. “As serious, as intense, as professional as we have to be, there has to be a release that you have with your relationships within the game,” Watterson said. “That is a microcosm of the game within the game.” It was a lesson that began to reach Watterson in 2009, when Steve McNair – the former NFL Most Valuable Player – was found dead in a Nashville condominium, the victim of what police ruled was a murder-suicide. The human side of the business was laid bare in the months that followed, as details of McNair’s affair with a 20-year-old waitress were splashed across the same media outlets who had once hailed the quarterback as a local hero. Page 3 of 3 - “That challenged me to never overlook an indiscretion that I knew may be existing,” Watterson said. “I confront the player directly. I say, ‘I’m not judging you, but I want to let you know that you’re not invisible.’” It was an occasion that forced Watterson to veer from his daily routine – he wore a suit to McNair’s funeral, one additional day to the usual 10 annually -- all team travel days -- where he can be found in anything other than sweatpants and a team-issued shirt. The mirror-averse, muscled, bald-headed NFL veteran hides in plain sight much like he did during his URI days, where football and off-field pursuits as a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity took up more time than academics. That’s all changed for Watterson now as he eyes a fourth decade in the league. It’s a tenure he never envisioned, and it prompted him to ask URI president David Dooley for current contact information to look up some of his old friends. “The reason I need their contact numbers is to collect some money,” Watterson joked. “I was probably one of the least likely to ever receive this award after leaving the university.” bkoch@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:19:29.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
