Buy this photo carl su/Staff photographer Blue Eagles senior Casey King blasts a kill past the Golden Knights defense. She finished with six kills and six digs. \n\"I thought we played exceptionally well in the first game,\" said Old Tappan coach Melissa Landeck. \"I thought Immaculate Heart made some adjustments and played us really tough in the second set. They got out to a nice lead and what I was most proud of my team for was we hung in there.\" \nThe Blue Eagles defense was impenetrable, as they blocked or touched shot after shot. \n\"They have some good blockers and they affected us at certain points of the game,\" said Landeck. \"We had to get past that and keep doing what we know we're good at, use our confidence if we got blocked here or there.\" \nAfter an Old Tappan timeout Illovsky blasted one of her seven kills and then earned three service points to cut the lead in half. \n\"Maya's a junior who has been on varsity since freshman year,\" said Landeck. \"She's improved each year with experience. She's a very consistent player and a kid we trust with the ball in tight situations. She makes good decisions and is one of our hardest workers.\" \n'NEVER GAVE UP' \nThe teams traded points until back-to-back blasts by senior Natalie Alechko brought the Knights to within one, 15-14. \n\"Early in the game we got into a little bit of a rut,\" said Kaiser, \"but since it was so early in the game we just focused and played harder. We just really had to focus on the next play.\" \n\"We were down in the beginning,\" Illovsky said. \"It really helped that we didn't get down on ourselves. It was 'next point, we can do this.' We never gave up on each other. We started picking it up and our momentum came back.\" \nThe two teams continued to trade points and Illovsky pounded two consecutive kills and the Blue Eagles committed an attack error as Old Tappan tied the game at 22-all. \n\"There was that deficit,\" said Landeck, \"and we had the first set in our pockets, but we didn't just roll over and say, 'ok, it's going to go three.' Sometimes that's a tendency of volleyball players. I like that we stayed in the moment and fought for that set. I thought that was really important to prove something to ourselves.\" \nMULTIPLE HITTERS \nDuring the match no fewer than seven players from each team scored points. Kaiser and Illovsky finished with seven kills apiece, sophomore Julia Passante had six and Alechko five. Casey King and Annabel Reyes led the way for IHA with six kills each. \n\"I think one of strengths is that every player on our team is capable of doing different things,\" Illovsky said. \"Everybody is capable of hitting the ball. I think it's better when they are not expecting it from one person.\" \n\"It's great we have so many hitters,\" added senior setter Kelly Brogan, who distributed 22 assists. \"Everybody's been working really hard, even in practice. We have a lot of competition. Everyone wants to get on the court and we just make each other better.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:53:30.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
