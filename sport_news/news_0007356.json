This week, Ohio State had 39 first-place votes in the poll released Sunday after routing Rutgers. \nBaylor, Clemson, LSU and TCU - the rest of the top 5 - also received first-place votes, as did No. 7 Alabama. \nUtah had its highest regular-season ranking after climbing to No. 3 last week, but dropped 10 spots after losing to unranked Southern California. \nFlorida State also dropped after its first loss of the season, falling eight places to No. 17. The Seminoles lost 22-16 to Georgia Tech on a blocked field goal that was returned for a touchdown on the game's final play. Â©2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
