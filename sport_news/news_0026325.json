Ninety-four golfers will compete at state this year. \nHoopingarner, who took 11th place overall at last week’s regional after shooting a 103, will tee off first at 10 a.m. on hole No. 10. Goebel will tee off at 10:10 a.m., and Lopez begins at 10:20 a.m. \nIt’s the third time Goebel will compete at state, but the first time as an individual qualifier. She finished 70th in 2013 and tied for 80th last year. \nFor Lopez, the state tournament will be her third varsity tournament — the first time at a course outside of Lawrence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:35:56.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
