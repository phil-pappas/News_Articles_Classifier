(AP) — Mike Holloway rushed for three touchdowns and the Charleston Southern defense allowed just 115 total yards in a 37-7 win over Monmouth on Saturday. \nHolloway finished with 78 yards on 14 carries to pace a Charleston Southern (4-1, 1-0 Big South) offense that finished with 275 yards rushing. Darius Hammond added 64 yards and a score on 10 carries. Monmouth (2-4, 0-1) came into the game allowing just 124 rushing yards per game. \nHolloway’s 5-yard touchdown run in the first quarter capped a 7-play, 63-yard drive and was the first of 37 consecutive points by the Buccaneers. \nMonmouth went three-and-out on nine of its first 10 offensive possessions, had just 53 total yards going into the fourth quarter and converted just 1 of 13 third downs overall. \nThe 115 yards allowed were the fewest by a Charleston Southern team since moving to the FCS in 1993.
