Thompkins was signed by Patriots as undrafted free agent in 2013 and also spent time with Raiders last year before spending summer with New England again. … Game marks return to Foxborough for CB Darrelle Revis, who helped lead Patriots to Super Bowl win last season, his only year in New England after six with Jets and one with Buccaneers. … Jets trying for first 5-1 start since 2010, when team advanced to AFC championship. … RB Chris Ivory coming off first back-to-back 100 yards rushing performances of career.

He reached milestone in 70 games, fastest in NFL history for tight end. Fantasy Tip: After back-to-back 100-yard games (a combined 312 against Washington and Miami), Jets RB Chris Ivory could have another big day against No. 22 rushing defense. Patriots WR Julian Edelman has banged-up finger and he’s going against No. 1 defense in league. It could be week to start someone else. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:05:01.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
