(AP Photo/Brandon Wade) \nNEW YORK (AP) — The New England Patriots have strengthened their grip on the top spot in the AP’s latest Pro32 NFL power rankings with another dominating victory, and an AFC title game rematch coming up against the Indianapolis Colts. \nThe Patriots (4-0) received nine first-place votes and 381 points in balloting by the 12 media members who regularly cover the league. Green Bay (5-0) remains second with three-first place votes and 373 points. Last week, New England had a 7-5 edge in first-place votes. \nWith a 27-24 overtime win over Seattle, Cincinnati (5-0) moved up to third with 360 points. Denver (5-0) dropped to fourth after a 16-10 win over Oakland. Atlanta (5-0) is fifth. \nThe Patriots easily defeated injury-depleted Dallas 30-6, and visit the Colts (3-2) on Sunday night. Indianapolis improved five places to 12th with a 27-20 win over Houston last Thursday night. \nJacksonville replaces Tampa Bay at No. 32 after its loss to the Buccaneers. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:04:06.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
