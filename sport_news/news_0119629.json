So we go to a different level of professional relationship.\" \nThat means \"you don't get from me (a) good and funny headline\" from the news conference ahead of Saturday's match at West Ham, Mourinho said. \nPressure is growing on Mourinho, with Chelsea just 12th in the Premier League. \nIn separate videos, Mourinho was harangued by teenagers, whose complaints were published by British media outlets. \nMourinho decried \"no respect.\" \nChelsea backed Mourinho saying he was being interrupted while on the phone and the teenagers' actions go \"beyond the grounds of reasonable behavior.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:37:30.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
