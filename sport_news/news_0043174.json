Since taking over the Bears’ program in 2011, Gottlieb had leaned heavily on the two. They were one of the conference’s most dynamic duos: Boyd, the fiery point guard, picking apart defenses with feeds to Gray down low.\nTheir graduations, as well as the dismissal last month of starting guard Mercedes Jefflo , leaves Gottlieb with a youthful roster. Five of Cal’s 10 players are freshmen. As the lone returning starters, sophomores Gabby Green and Mikayla Cowling are effectively leaders.\n“We’re excited for the next thing to be on tap,” Gottlieb said Wednesday at Pac-12 media day. “These young ones are so talented, and they’re ready to take the next step. It’s time for that transition.”\nGottlieb owns the most wins in a four-year span of any Cal women’s basketball coach. Each season she has been at the helm, the Bears reached at least the second round of the NCAA Tournament.\nPast successes, of course, mean little for a program replacing two WNBA players.\nUnlike last season, when the Bears’ offense flowed largely through Boyd and Gray, it will take a more committee approach.\nAt least four women can play three positions. Over the past year, Gottlieb has studied how the Warriors excel without much worry about positions. Head coach Steve Kerr , who has two children playing sports at Cal, has invited her to Oracle Arena and fielded her questions.\n“If you’re a basketball coach, you have to keep learning,” said Gottlieb, whose team opens its season Nov. 13 at Austin Peay State. “Having the Warriors in our backyard has been really helpful.”\nGreen, who averaged 6.7 points per game last season, is the top candidate to replace Boyd at starting point guard. Freshman Kristine Anigwe will be tasked with replacing much of Gray’s low-post production.\nGottlieb started recruiting the Phoenix native as a freshman in high school. By the time Anigwe committed to Cal early in her junior year, she was blossoming into one of the nation’s elite posts. She was the only female participant in April in the McDonald’s All-American Game’s dunk contest.\n“She may be the most athletic player we’ve ever had,” Gottlieb said.\nCoaches picked the Bears to finish tied for fourth with UCLA in the Pac-12 standings. That they were still projected to land in the upper half of the conference, despite losing three of their top four scorers from last season, was the product of the respect Gottlieb commands, and the expectations for underclassmen.\nCowling, who chipped in 10 points per game in 2014-15 as a sidekick to Boyd and Gray, said:\n“We’re very confident in who we have coming back. We know where we can go, who we can be.”\nConnor Letourneau is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
