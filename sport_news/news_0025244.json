Sam Gagner, Claude Giroux and Matt Read scored to lead the Flyers to their 12th straight regular-season home victory over Chicago. The Flyers have not lost to the Blackhawks in Philly during the regular season since Nov. 9, 1996. The Blackhawks beat the Flyers in the 2010 Stanley Cup Final and clinched with a Game 6 win in Philly. Filling in for Steve Mason, Neuvirth was sensational in his ninth career shutout. Mason missed a second straight game because of unspecified family reasons and there was no word when he would return. \nSenators 7, Blue Jackets 3 \nCOLUMBUS \nBobby Ryan and Mika Zibanejad each had a goal and two assists, Erik Karlsson added a career-high four assists, and Ottawa improved to 3-0-0 on the road for the first time since the start of the 2007-08 season. Kyle Turris had a goal and an assist, and Marc Methot, Milan Michalek, Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Mike Hoffman also scored for the Senators. Ryan Stone had two assists and Craig Anderson made 37 saves. Brandon Saad, Boone Jenner and Brandon Dubinsky scored for Columbus. The Blue Jackets have dropped their first four games in regulation for the first time in the franchise’s 15-year history. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:55:58.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
