Week 5 coverage of high school football at the Shore \nThe Week 5 meeting between non-divisional foes Toms River East and Freehold Township was set for Friday night, but due to rain, winds, and lightning was pushed back to a 1 p.m. start on Saturday at Freehold Township. The non-conference meeting between Old Bridge and Brick Memorial was also pushed back to Saturday at 1 p.m, as was the Class B South matchup featuring Donovan Catholic and Jackson Liberty. \nThe anticipated Class A South meeting between Jackson Memorial and Toms River North suffered a wash out and is postponed until Saturday at 7 p.m. at Toms River. \nEarlier in the day, weather kept St. John Vianney from scoring any more points, as a lightning delay resulted in a cancellation of the second half, and the Lancers earning a 35-0 victory over Manchester.
