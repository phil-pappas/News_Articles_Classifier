A former chemical engineer, Gellrich is a consultant for major chemical companies within the United States. \nGellrich, who was traveling to Pittsburgh on Monday to speak at a conference, said he expects Shell to make a final decision in the next 24 months, and if the development at the Potter site is any indication, that answer will be a positive one for Beaver County. \n“If you look closely at what Shell has done, it’s gone down a checklist of sorts in doing everything one would think they would need to do to start up a cracker,” he said. “They’re moving ahead at a slow pace, but they’re moving ahead on all the issues.” \nGellrich is following closely other projects in Ohio and West Virginia, some of which have been announced but not acted upon and others that have been announced but since temporarily shelved. \nThe proposed cracker plant on the old Horsehead Corp. site here could have a domino effect on other cracker plants being built in the region, he said. \n“The first one that comes online will solidify the Appalachian region as a suitable region for cracker plants,” he said. \nAnother positive indication of Shell’s plans for the cracker plant here lies within other developments inside the company, he said. Gellrich said Shell hasn’t been shy in canceling other projects involving Arctic drilling or other proposals in Louisiana and Canada. Yet site work and other development continues here, Gellrich said, despite a downturn in the oil and gas market. \n“Shell has canceled or delayed a bunch of other projects,” he said. “So it shows the company isn’t shy in canceling or postponing investments. Others have gone by the wayside, and this one is still moving ahead.” \nIt doesn’t hurt that Shell has already spent well more than $100 million on the project, from engineering to site development to remediation, he said. \nThat amount of money is by no means breaking the bank for a multibillion-dollar international company, Gellrich said, but a tremendous amount of work has already been done for the project. \n“They’ve already purchased the land, they’ve negotiated with the state in obtaining the necessary permits, they’ve done the site prep and remediation, they’ve done local community outreach,” Gellrich said. \nJack Manning, president of the Beaver County Chamber of Commerce, said he agrees with Gellrich’s assertion that Shell is very likely to be the first cracker project built in the region. \n“That’s consistent with everything I’ve read and heard,” said Manning. \nHe also agreed the Potter site could have a domino effect on other cracker plants being built in the tri-state area. \n“Geographically and economically, it makes too much sense,” he said. “The timing hasn’t been as quick as we thought, but I’m still very bullish on the idea that there will be a cracker plant in Potter Township as well as further development in the tri-state area.” \nShell spokesman Michael Marr said the company “will continue to refrain from commenting on speculation about the proposed project.” More information", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:42:23.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
