The Huskies were picked 11th and the Cougars 12th respectively in the Pac-12 preseason media poll. Not much is expected from Washington, which placed 11th in the conference last season at 5-13 and finished 16-15 overall while missing the postseason. The Huskies are a bit of a mystery after losing nine players to graduation, transfer or dismissal. Washington, which returns just two players (Andrew Andrews and Donaven Dorsey) who were in the rotation, must integrate seven freshman and one junior-college transfer. Washington State returns three starters (Josh Hawkinson, Ike Iroegbu and Ny Redding) from last season’s team that tied for eighth in the league at 7-11 and finished 13-18 during the first year with coach Ernie Kent. Meanwhile, Arizona received 18 of the 36 first-place votes and secured the top spot in the poll for the fourth straight year. California collected nine first-place votes and finished 18 points behind the Wildcats. Utah, which had seven first-place votes, is third is also 18 points behind the Utes. Oregon came in at fourth place and UCLA fifth. Both teams received one first-place vote. Oregon State compiled 235 points for sixth. The bottom half of the poll includes: Colorado (188), Arizona State (165), Stanford (145), USC (111), UW and WSU.
