The bruising sixth-year running back is quite conspicuous and often can be found leveling opposing defenders, and making plenty of extra yards after contact.\nNew teammate Brandon Marshall, who was traded to the Jets from Chicago in March, has been quite impressed with Ivory, so much so that Wednesday he called him \"the best running back in the league right now.\"\nMarshall added, \"Just watch the tape — speed, quickness, agility, vision, endurance. He has it all.\n\"He runs really violently,\" Marshall said. \"He has great feet, great vision. He’s humble, and he doesn’t even know how good he can be. And that’s the scary part.\"\nIvory’s 314 yards rushing ranks him 13th in the NFL, despite the fact he has played in only three games. The Jets had their bye last week, and Ivory missed a Week 3 loss to Philadelphia because of a quadriceps injury. He is averaging 5.0 yards per carry and has three touchdowns.\nIt’s not a coincidence that the Jets had a season-low of 47 rushing yards in the game that Ivory sat out.\nOffensive coordinator Chan Gailey, in his first year with the Jets, said Thursday that he knew very little about Ivory before coming here.\n\"I watched the film and he obviously has ability,\" Gailey said, \"but the toughness aspect is something that you don’t know until you see it up close and [see] how physical he plays.\"\n\"Chris takes a lot of hits,\" right guard Willie Colon said. \"He may get dinged, but he still fights his tail off. And for us [on the offensive line], we understand if we get him going early and we let him get in a groove, the outcome is going to be in our favor. It’s up to us up front to really get him going and get him comfortable early, and he’s going to take care of the rest.\n\"Our goal,\" Colon added, \"is to get him on [the opponent’s] side of the line and he’ll take care of the rest.\"\nIvory, who is in his third year with the Jets, had a career-high 198 carries last season, but is on pace to have 315. Considering his violent, collision-filled style of running, the Jets need to limit his touches to try to help him remain healthy.\n\"We’re going to monitor it,\" Gailey said, \"and make sure that we give him breaks and use other people in there to be able to run the football. We can’t just run him when he’s in there and then throw it when he’s not in there. Everybody will figure that out. But we’ve got to give him some breaks.\"\nMarshall said Ivory told him months ago that his goal for 2015 was to reach the 1,000-yard mark, something Ivory has yet to do in a season. His high was 833 yards in 2013.\n\"I’m like, ‘What? No, the goal is 1,500 or better,’ \" Marshall recalled. \"The sky’s the limit for him.\"\nWhich is why the Jets need to occasionally take him off the field so he can stay on it for the long haul.\nBRIEFS: CB Antonio Cromartie, who was limited in practice Wednesday because of a groin injury, was excused from practice Thursday for personal reasons. Coach Todd Bowles said he expects Cromartie to play Sunday against the Redskins. … Washington coach Jay Gruden told reporters that WR DeSean Jackson \"had a little issue here and there\" with his ailing hamstring during practice Thursday. Jackson has missed the past four games because of the injury and this apparent setback might mean he won’t be ready to play Sunday. … CBS’ \"60 Minutes\" will include a segment Sunday night on CB Darrelle Revis.\n</div>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:06.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
