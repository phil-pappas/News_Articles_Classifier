It's the lasting memory of Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS against the Marlins. \nTuesday night, they host another one: Game 3 of this National League Championship Series . The Mets have a 2-0 lead and will put Jacob deGrom on the mound . Chicago will go with right-handed pitcher Kyle Hendricks. \nIt's not a must-win game but Chicago risks falling behind 3-0. And only one team has even come back from 2-0 down in the NLCS out of the 10 that have fallen into that position since the series expanded to seven games in 1985.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:58:39.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
