That effort failed, and now the soccer star wants to negotiate with Miami to build one next to Marlins Park in Little Havana. Hector Gabino El Nuevo Herald i Order Reprint of this Story \nAfter years of false starts, David Beckham may finally be on the verge of a deal that would allow for the construction of a professional soccer stadium in Little Havana. \nEarly this week, in meetings with city, county and school board officials, representatives of Beckham’s investment group discussed a swift-moving proposal that would give Miami Beckham United or a wholly owned subsidiary permission to build a 30,000-seat stadium on about 10.5 acres of land belonging to the city, county and a few private property owners. Presuming Beckham's group follows through with plans to purchase the private properties, he and his partners would pay the city a “management fee” of $850,000 a year over 60 years. \nIn exchange for the payments, the city would possibly transfer its land to the Miami-Dade School Board in order to spare the team from paying property taxes on its stadium and to create partnerships with local schools — a new wrinkle that removes Miami-Dade County as a likely partner on the stadium property. School Board members plan to meet Thursday “to discuss exploring collaborative opportunities with public and private parties for the development of athletic and educational facilities.” \nOn Wednesday, Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said the partnership presents unique opportunities for the district, including a privately funded sports magnet school at the stadium, paid for by the Beckham group. The team would potentially get access to a young, eager fan base. \n“The success of a sports franchise like soccer relies on grooming early-on an audience.... We teach 355,000 pre-K-through-12 students and additional 150,000 adults a year,” said Carvalho. “We represent an entity... that certainly could be a supportive audience of this franchise.” \nWe represent an entity... that certainly could be a supportive audience of this franchise. \nSchool Board Superintendent Alberto Carvalho \nMiami Mayor Tomás Regalado said he is anxious to see the school board act. The mayor hopes to be able to put an agreement before Miami city commissioners in December, or at the very least present referendum language that would need to be approved by the end of the year in order to be placed on the presidential primary ballot in March. Otherwise, with the mayor adamant that the public get a vote on any stadium deal, the city would have to pay about $2 million to host a stand-alone election. \n“We're running against the clock,” said Regalado. “We have to have [referendum] wording by late December.” \nBeckham and his team of investors have been pursuing a soccer stadium in Miami for years. Initially they sought a site at PortMiami. When that deal fell through, they chased an ill-fated proposal to fill in Miami’s FEC slip and build a stadium in part of the city’s new Museum Park. That proposal was also defeated, and Beckham’s group ultimately agreed to build on 10.5 acres of mostly public land directly west of Marlins Park. \nFor months, Regalado and Miami’s city manager have negotiated with Beckham’s team, which recently tapped Tim Leiweke, the president and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, to head talks in Miami. The expectation has been that the city would enter into an agreement with the Major League Soccer franchise to sell its land and transfer ownership to the county, which has tax-exempt status. But over the last several days, sources familiar with negotiations say Miami Beckham United began to look at a partnership with the Miami-Dade School Board, which also has tax-exempt status but can offer up partnerships with schools as well. \nRegalado said an education component would make a referendum an easier sell to voters in Miami, where stadium deals have been tainted by the closed-door agreement that provided hundreds of millions in subsidies for Marlins Park. Miami Beckham United has repeatedly said it will build the stadium with private funds, but Regalado said a partnership that would include hosting big district football games and events would only make an agreement more palatable. \nStill, the proposal to bring in the school board could complicate the politics of building the stadium. Regalado’s daughter, Raquel Regalado, sits on the school board and is running for Miami-Dade Mayor against incumbent Carlos Gimenez. Gimemez has reportedly told Beckham’s representatives that he won’t block a deal, even though it would reduce the county to a bit player. \nWe're running against the clock. We have to have [referendum] wording by late December. \nMiami Mayor Tomás Regalado \n“Mayor Gimenez has always supported and will continue to support bringing Major League Soccer to Miami-Dade County,” Michael Hernández, Gimenez's spokesman, said in a statement. “He would be supportive of any arrangement that would result in an MLS franchise playing in our community, but he continues to believe that a stadium should be built with private and not taxpayer dollars.” \nSchool board members said they had been provided scarce details about a possible deal as of Wednesday afternoon. But Raquel Regalado said the district needs a stadium to host large events like graduations and popular sports events such as the Soul Bowl. She said the district considered building a stadium with bond money, when voters approved $1.2 billion for capital improvements and technology upgrades, but the needs were too great at existing schools. \n“This time around, we’ll actually be able to have a benefit and we’ll actually be able to build a stadium and have a stadium that we, as a board, would never be able to do with public funds,” she said. \nThe proposed agreement with the city, dated Oct. 2 but received by the city only last Friday, holds the team responsible for the cost of stadium construction, and requires the team's ownership to invest in capital improvements at least once every decade. Miami Beckham United declined to comment for this story, but has repeatedly said it intends to privately finance the stadium’s construction. The agreement does, however, contemplate that ownership might seek tax credits, business incentives and tax-exempt financing.
