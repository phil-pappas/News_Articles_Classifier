If anything, I feel the complete opposite. I fully expect us to win every time we walk onto the field. That's not an underdog.\"\nThat's what Dantonio says in a long feature on MSU's resurgence in the new ESPN the Magazine.\nBut don't think his players have forgotten where they came from.\n\"They used to say we couldn't win the conference, and we have,\" quarterback Connor Cook says. \"They used to say we couldn't win the Rose Bowl, and we have. They said we couldn't beat Michigan. But we will still have a chip on our shoulder, no matter what.\n\"Did you see our summer weight room shirts?\"\nThose would be the T-shirts the Spartans talked about at Big Ten Media Days, with a poker chip and a Sparty logo on the shoulder.\n\"A couple of players admit that they continued to wear those shirts under their pads in August, leading with their chip shoulder so it would collide first with the blocking sleds,\" Ryan McGee writes in ESPN the Magazine's \"Owners Issue.\"\nIt hits newsstands Friday, but the story has already been posted online .\n\"After decades of Big Ten irrelevance and too many Saturdays spent telling stories of dusty national title trophies (the newest of the six MSU claims is from Duffy Daugherty's fabled '66 squad), the Spartans are squarely in the middle of the College Football Playoff conversation,\" McGee writes.\n\"Yet despite the recent success, MSU undoubtedly continues to trail those (Michigan and Ohio State) in the public eye and in the view of recruits. The Buckeyes have been on the rise since Urban Meyer's first season in 2012, as well as No. 1 in the polls since winning the inaugural playoff. As of late September, Meyer also had the No. 1 recruiting class for 2016. Meanwhile, the Wolverines, who cracked the AP Top 25 for the first time since Oct. 27, 2013, are ranked No. 1 in magazine covers, thanks to the arrival of Jim Harbaugh, who has catapulted UM from 40th in the '15 recruiting ranks to No. 10 this year. ...\n\"So, yes, Ohio State and Michigan are Chevy and Ford. Michigan State is Oldsmobile. And the Spartans dig being Oldsmobile.\"\n(The article draws on Lansing's Oldsmobile legacy to point out these are your father's Spartans, if dad was around in the Duffy days.)\n\"That's how we do it around here,\" safety RJ Williamson says. \"People might buy more T-shirts from another school. The media might send more cameras to cover another team. Other teams might get more votes for the Top 25. But around here, we don't let that get us down. We'd rather operate as the underdog. That's fuel.\"\nâ€¢ Related: Follow Schrader's sports oddities in the Ticker\nContact Steve Schrader: sschrader@freepress.com.
