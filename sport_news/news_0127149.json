Delta’s mayor isn’t shutting the idea down outright.\nIt was at a conference in New York yesterday where Rachel Notley suggested Kinder Morgan could find more support for a route that ends at Deltaport, instead of Burrard Inlet.\nDelta’s Mayor Lois Jackson has not been approached about the idea. “It’s an international question as opposed to a local question, but you certainly have to talk with people and understand what the questions are before you can even begin to discuss anything further than that.”\nBut she says it wouldn’t be a firm “no” from her without learning more about any plans. “Pipeline, across this country, has been here for a long, long time and in many other places and it’s by in large good, clean fuel for people. It’s a lot better than coal.”\nFor its part, Kinder Morgan claims it isn’t exploring this at all, saying going ahead with the twinning at Burrard Inlet is the easiest, safest way.\nRelated Stories Pipeline battle could set tone for future government, aboriginal relations Ontario and Alberta agree to fight climate change in their own ways burnaby mountain | Lois Jackson | Rachel Notley | Trans Mountain pipeline", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RachelNotley", "https://twitter.com/MayorofDelta"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:45:11.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
