The Cubs' previous record for most homers in a playoff game was five in the opener of the 1984 NL Championship Series against San Diego. \nA third straight win for Chicago on Tuesday afternoon, and the once woebegone franchise will advance to the NLCS for the first time in 12 years. The Cardinals, who led the majors with 100 wins this season, have won at least one playoff series in each of the last four years. \nJason Heyward and Stephen Piscotty homered for St. Louis, and Jhonny Peralta had a run-scoring double.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:57:48.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
