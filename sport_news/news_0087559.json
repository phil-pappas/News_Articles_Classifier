(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette) Article Blue Jays come close, but just can't finish in ninth against Royals \nKANSAS CITY — Well, that’s that. \nIn the end the Blue Jays proved to not be good enough, not in the six games they played the Kansas City Royals in the ALCS. \nThe Royals may have beat them four games to two but in their clubhouse following the 4-3 loss late Friday, nobody conceded that the Royals were the better team. \nHere’s what the Jays were saying after the Game 6 loss. \nMARCO ESTRADA \nEstrada was one of the bright surprises on the pitching front this season and the free agent extended the series with his terrific performance in Game 5 back at Rogers Centre. How would he describe the 2015 Jays? \n“This is a tremendous team,” Estrada started off. “We were good from the beginning. Right out of spring training I thought we had a really good team and then put a few pieces together (at the trade deadline) and became a great team. \n“It’s disappointing because this team should have gone all the way, all the way. I’m proud of the guys the way we played all year. We got pretty far but this team we should have won the whole thing.” \nWhy didn’t they win? \n“I don’t know, that’s the way baseball is,” Estrada replied. “The best team doesn’t always win, it’s just the way baseball is. It’s a crazy sport. It’s not like basketball or football where the best team is probably going to win. But you have to tip your hat to the Royals, they battled, they didn’t give up either and that’s just the way it goes. \n“I kept saying I thought we had the best team, they outplayed us this time.” \nNobody knows what the future holds for Estrada but he said he’ll treasure his time with the Jays and would like to come back. \n“This group is such a good group, a bunch of good guys,” he said. “It was just a lot of fun to be a part of this clubhouse for sure. This is one of the best clubhouses I’ve ever been a part of. I’m not sure what’s going to happen but these guys are awesome and I’m going to keep in contact with all of them and who knows, I hope to come back.” \nCHRIS COLABELLO \nColabello was one of the major surprises for the Jays this season as he came from virtually nowhere to share first base duties with Justin Smoak. Then in the post-season, manager John Gibbons rode his bat and played him every game. \n“I know at some point there’s only one team left standing,” Colabello said. “It’s a great group, it’s a shame it has to end.” \nThe resiliency of the Royals — how many teams have a player on their roster that can score on a single into the right field corner all the way from first? — came out in the series time and again. \n“They’re notorious for that, they’re not a group that gives in,” Colabello said. “You saw it a little bit in Game 3 when we were ahead by a lot in the late innings and they just kept coming, they don’t go away. That’s what good teams do and I think we’re a lot the same, we weren’t going to down without a fight. \n“They came out on the winning end and you have to tip your cap to them. We were still there, we gave ourselves a chance in the ninth against a guy whose reputation precedes him (Wade Davis). That’s all you can ask for, you go out and compete and leave it all out there and I think we did that all year. There’s nothing to be ashamed of, that’s for sure.” \nHow would he would describe the season? \n“I mean, you want to win your last game I think but all in all we did a lot of great stuff. It’s a great group and the most fun I’ve ever had playing.” \nR.A. DICKEY \nDickey had an up-and-down season but in the end he logged the most innings and was terrific over the final two months. He should have earned the win in Game 4 against Texas but was pulled one out shy of five innings. Then in Game 4 against the Royals he had nothing and was gone in the second inning. \nDickey is available to come back if the club wants him, as the Jays have an option on him for $12 million. \n“I think the country, the city, the fans, the organization, our team have so much to be proud of,” Dickey said. “To be one of the last three teams, the best last three teams in the world is pretty awesome. It’s still fresh right now (the loss), it’s hard to be satisfied with your season but I think in a day or two I’ll be happy we got as far as we did. But all of us in here think we should be moving on ... I don’t know if we played our best and that’s what’s painful.” As a country, as a city, as an organization, and most of all as fans.. So much to be proud of! Thank you Toronto for a great ride! #gratitude — R.A. Dickey (@RADickey43) October 24, 2015 \nJOSH DONALDSON \nDonaldson became a greater player than anybody could have imagined and is right there in MVP consideration with the Angels’ Mike Trout. He had a fabulous season and was the last man standing in the ninth, the last hope who couldn’t deliver the tying run as he ended the series by grounding out to third. \nHe believes the Jays learned a lot about themselves this campaign and that will serve them well in the coming years. \n“It’s been an amazing season and obviously we wanted it to continue,” he said. “There’s so many guys in here that really stepped up and became better players and it’s been a fun ride. \n“There’s been a lot of learning this season for a lot of guys including myself and I feel like it can only make you better in the end.” \nHe was asked to expand on his comments. \n“Just throughout the course of the season we had a lot of guys in the lineup who hadn’t really experienced that (stretch run, post-season) and you learn a lot about yourself, you learn a lot about what it takes to do that and ultimately what it takes to win ball games. At the end of the day that’s what’s most important, how can you help your team win and I felt a lot of guys learned a lot about themselves and how to prepare day in and day out.” \nNext year, it’s already about next year. It would be a shame not to build off what they achieved in 2015. Not the ending any of us wanted, but I'm so proud and thankful for all my teammates and staff.
