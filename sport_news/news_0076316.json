Emirates Team New Zealand \nThe Team New Zealand crew in full flight (from left) Ray Davies, Glenn Ashby, Peter Burling and Blair Tuke. \nWhile holders Oracle have long been sailing in Bermuda and rivals Artemis Racing (Sweden), Ben Ainslie Racing (Britain) and Team Japan have also had experience there, the Kiwis are anxious to get a taste of conditions. \nPractice racing is held on Friday and Saturday with the four official races sailed on Sunday and Monday (NZ time). \nThe Kiwis have been busy erecting their temporary base and putting together their 45-foot foiling catamaran. \n\"This is really important for us,\" Tuke says down the phone from Bermuda. \n\"A couple of the guys have been here before but it's the first time for me and Peter (Burling). It's an interesting place, it's really beautiful in some aspects but it's quite small. It's important for us to get to know it and learn the waters. We just have to go out there and do our best and keep learning.\" \nTuke acknowledges the advantages some of the other teams have in terms of time on the water, but backs Team New Zealand to be able to react and adjust as they did in claiming second in Portsmouth and then victory in Sweden in conditions that were foreign to them. \n\"At the end of the day it's a similar race course to what we have been racing. We'll see what the days bring. Sailing is so short and sharp, there are no real patterns, you just have to take what you see and that's one of our strengths for sure – just try and get the boat around the track as fast as we can under the conditions.\" Ad Feedback \nIt's been a huge year for Tuke and his good mate Burling as they start to immerse themselves in the America's Cup scene while keeping a focus on their major goal of winning gold in the demanding 49er class at the Rio Olympics next year. \nThey have had another unbeaten year in their skiff, including claiming the Rio test event. They will look to round that out by defending their world title in Buenos Aires, Argentina next month. \nTheir success in both classes has seen them nominated again for the world sailor of the year title, a crown they were pipped for last year by Oracle rival Jimmy Spithill. \nTuke is loving the double challenge. \n\"For myself it's been a big transition to the America's Cup. It's been a steep learning curve but the more experienced guys on the team have been really welcoming. \n\"The way we have all gelled together - Peter and I and a couple of other young guys have brought a fresh look to the team - it seems to be working quite nicely. We just have to get better.\" \nTuke has had to make adjustments. On the 49er, Burling steers and he provides the speed through his trimming skills. \nOn the AC45s, Burling has the helm while skipper Glenn Ashby is in charge of the big wingsail. Tuke looks after the forward sails and works the foils. It's a lot more physical but he's not going to be getting carried away adjusting his body shape just yet – he wants to keep the same dimensions for his Olympics campaign where they look to step up from the silver at London 2012. \n\"We have said all along our goal for now is Rio next year. That comes first, that's the priority, nothing changes for that.\" \nThere will be little rest. \nAfter the worlds, Tuke and Blair will be part of a busy summer with Team New Zealand as they start to get their crucial test programme underway, working with boats that will eventually lead them into the sophisticated 48-foot model to be used for the actual America's Cup. \n\"It will be good to get sailing as a group in Auckland. \n\"The world series events are important to us but the testing is crucial. The systems on the new boats are a lot more ahead of what we have got on these boats. It's important for us to keep pushing and make sure we are as fast as we can be for 2017.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:57:43.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
