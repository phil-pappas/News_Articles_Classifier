Station's defense, allowing only 16 points a game, will be the toughest Scott's faced since an out-of-state battle with Cincinnati Elder last month. \nNo. 10 Lafayette (6-2) at Madison Central (4-3), 7:30: Mark Scenters' Indians looked the part of contenders early but are 1-3 in their last four games. That's also their record against Lexington schools. Upending the Generals, who've scored 100 more points on the season than Madison Central, would feel good as the postseason nears. \nHenry Clay (3-4) at Paul Laurence Dunbar (3-4), 7:30: The Blue Devils' talent is more seasoned but also in the midst of a three-game losing streak. Dunbar had a three-game win streak snapped last week at Bryan Station but held the Defenders to 19 points. \nLexington Catholic (4-3) at No. 7 Boyle County (7-0), 7:30: Does the Knights' air raid have enough firepower to upset the mighty Rebels, who've scored 40-plus in every game since their opener and allowed no more than 21 points in a game this season? One fact on LexCath's side: Boyle Coach Chuck Smith is 0-3 in his last three games versus the Knights. \nSomerset (4-3) at Lexington Christian (5-2), 7:30: Dillon Wheatley has been a hoss for the Eagles, who have more than 3,000 yards of offense on the year. Wheatley is responsible for more than a third of that with 1,295 yards between the ground and air. The Briar Jumpers' four wins are against teams that are a combined 4-23. \nTates Creek (3-4) at Clark County (0-7), 7:30: Can the Commodores go 2-0 in district play to set up a potential battle for the No. 1 seed at Lafayette next week? They gutted out an overtime win versus Madison Central. The Cards, managing just 18 points a game, meet a Creek defense that's giving up 41 a game — fourth most in 6A. \nTOP STATE GAMES \nNo. 1 Male (7-0) at No. 5 St. Xavier (5-2), 7:30: Twenty-six — that's the number of points Male's given up ... this season. The offense's 50 points a game is second behind only McCracken County in Class 6A. A September upset to Central still encourages doubt about the Tigers; an upset of their own would send shock waves through District 3. \nElizabethtown (7-0) at Adair County (7-0), 7:30: Bernil Cecil is averaging 129 yards on the ground and has scored eight TDs for the Panthers, whose last regular-season loss came on Oct. 10, 2014. Adair's Jordan Lasley is third in scoring in Class 3A — as is his team. \nLeslie County (7-0) at Shelby Valley (6-1), 7:30: The winner here likely takes the No. 1 seed in Class 2A's District 8. Does it go to the Eagles, who boast 2A's second-best scoring defense behind only DeSales? Or Shelby Valley, whose offense has churned out 2,203 yards on the ground? \nCorbin (4-3) at Bell County (6-1), 7:30: The Bobcats' only loss is to undefeated Boyle County — no shame there. They've beaten opponents by an average of 20 points in the five games since that loss. Corbin went 0-3 in a killer out-of-district stretch — Danville, Southwestern and Mayfield — but has shown well otherwise. \nLloyd Memorial (5-2) at Newport Central Catholic (3-4), 7: Lloyd Memorial nearly became the second team this season to beat Conner in a 6-0 loss last week. This is the part of the season when the Thoroughbreds start to figure things out. \nBishop Brossart (7-0) at Paris (8-0), 7:30: Paris averted disaster last week with a 12-7 win at Nicholas County. Brossart has three shutouts on the season; Paris allowed 12 points in its season opener and only five points a game in its last seven. \nConner (6-1) at No. 11 Ryle (6-1), 7:30: One suspects the Ryle will be out for blood coming off its first loss at Cooper last week, but the Jags have found a way to stay close in all their games this season except for a shutout loss to No. 4 Simon Kenton. \njosh moore, jmoore@herald-leader.com Josh Moore: (859) 231-1307.
