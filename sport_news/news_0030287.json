He said Sainz would not drive in the qualifying session scheduled for later on Saturday. \nThe accident brought Saturday morning’s third and final practice for this weekend’s Russian Grand Prix to a halt – and then an early conclusion – after 36 minutes. \nThe Toro Rosso driver’s car sheared off the track and into the barriers at turn 13 on the Sochi Autodromo circuit where he rammed into the wall under the fitted tec-pro barriers. \nThere were immediate calls for an explanation why the tec-pro barriers, designed to absorb the worst of this kind of accident, were fitted above the level of the car’s impact. \nThe session was red-flagged to a halt and then ended eight minutes later when it was officially announced that it was not being restarted. \nSainz was on his first flat-out high-speed run at the circuit, which, as a rookie, he was learning also for the first time.
