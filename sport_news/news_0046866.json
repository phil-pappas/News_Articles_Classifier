Anderlecht are expected to go ahead, but Gillet saves the penalty from Dennis Praet to keep the match open. Not the best strike, but Gillet makes the right call on the goal line. \nGillet is asked to do it again only six minutes later. The hosts create another spot-kick even though the foul is not that obvious. \nFormer Roma striker Stefano Okaka unleashes a low shot from the spot, but Gillet denies his effort with a fine diving stop. \nTwo minutes from time with Anderlecht leading 1-0, the Mechelen keeper is put to the test again. \nThe home side hope to double the tally, but another incredible save keeps the visitors alive. Mechelen finally get the equalizer deep in stoppage time to escape with a draw.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:21:08.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
