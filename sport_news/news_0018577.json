Becton Regional (4-1) at Arch Shaw Field on a foggy and misty Oct. 9 night, Cresskill (3-2) was lining up for potential tying field goal on 4th-and-3 at the 2-yard line. \nBut in a flash Wildcats senior defensive back Gianni Failla made a huge defensive play as he came barreling through to block the kick. Sophomore linebacker Nico Failla scooped up the loose ball and darted down the left sideline to the Cresskill 33-yard line. \nTwo plays later sophomore quarterback Michael Boswell delivered a pass to a right corner of the end zone that deflected off a Cougars player into the hands of junior wide receiver Seven Strong for a 23-yard touchdown. \nBecton led 10-0 with 1:05 left in the first half, en route to a 10-6 victory. \n\"Great timing by Nico and in the right place at the right time\" said Becton head coach Jackie Maher. \"The kids work hard during the week and are rewarded for that.\" \nCOUGARS FALL SHORT \nStarting out at their own 37-yard line with 59 seconds remaining, Cresskill moved the ball downfield as senior running back Brendan Coffey ripped off runs of eight and four yards. Junior quarterback Jack Maltby completed a 10-yard pass to junior wide receiver Thomas Garzino advancing the ball to the Cougars 49-yard line. \nA pass from Maltby intended for senior wide receiver Chris Riley was incomplete but a personal foul penalty was assessed against Becton for a late hit that kept the drive moving. \nAfter a false start set Cresskill back five yards, Maltby hooked up with Garzino on a 14-yard pass play and an 8-yard pass to junior wide receiver John Connelly. \nBut with 2.1 seconds left Maltby's pass into the end zone to junior wide receiver Shane Fedorov fell incomplete, ending the half. \nBecton received the second half kickoff and proceeded to chew up more than five minutes off the clock. Nevertheless the Cougars defense held, forcing the Wildcats to punt. \nThe Cougars got the ball on the 35-yard line and Coffey went back to work, gaining 24 yards on the ground. Maltby found his favorite target, Garzino, for 15 more yards. On 3rd-and-8 from the Becton 14-yard line, Maltby's pass to Connelly in the end zone was incomplete but the Wildcats were whistled for a roughing the passer penalty, giving Cresskill first and goal from the 6-yard line. \nMaltby displayed creativity, faking the handoff to Coffey and sneaking in for the score. Becton blocked the extra-point to make it 10-6 with 1:27 left in the third quarter. \n\"They made us earn everything,\" said Cresskill head coach Kevin Quinn. \"We moved the ball and then we would have a mistake and penalty. We're doing too many things right now to hurt ourselves.\" \nLAST CHANCE \nWith four minutes remaining in the game the Cougars caught a major break as the Wildcats fumbled the ball with Cougars junior linebacker John Connelly recovering the ball at the Cresskill 46-yard line. \nCoffey gained four yards on first down but Becton's defense tightened up forcing Maltby into two straight incomplete passes. The Cougars decided to go for it on 4th-and-6 at their own 42-yard line and Wildcats senior defensive lineman Alex Montalvo, who came into the game leading the team in sacks, registered his sixth of the season ending the Cresskill drive. Gianni Failla salted the game away with a 6-yard run on 3rd-and-2 from the Cougars 37-yard line with 2:14 left. \n\"Gianni Failla is a quality tailback who knows how to run the football, stretch for the extra yard and cover up the ball with two hands\" said Maher. \"Our guys showed up to play tonight and we were able to get a push on defense.\" \nBECTON GRABS 3-0 LEAD \nThe Wildcats were able to string together a 16-play drive in the second quarter taking almost 6:58 off the clock that resulted in a 25-yard field goal by senior James Loremikan giving Becton a 3-0 lead. \n\"The seven-minute drive to keep the ball out of their hands and a quality possession to come out with three points was phenomenal,\" said Maher. \"Our kicker, James Loremikan, is from London and that was his first American field goal.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:40:42.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
