By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nMINOOKA – The first four points that Minooka’s volleyball team scored against Oswego on Tuesday night summed up what the Indians have been as a team for most of the season. Related Links Old school strategy powers Minooka \nAfter Oswego took a 1-0 lead, Minooka scored the next four points, getting kills from three different players – Kamryn Johnson, Holly Bonde and Ginger Perinar – as well as an ace from server Rocky Perinar. That distribution of points has been an Indian hallmark this season. \nBut as the match, which Minooka won, 25-16, 25-23, wore on, it became clear that there is now a go-to hitter in the Indian lineup, Southern Illinois recruit Ginger Perinar. \nBy the time the match was over, Perinar had a team-leading 15 kills to go with a team high 15 digs as well as three service aces. Rocky Perinar and Johnson each had five kills, while Bonde and Emily Hise each had four kills. Bonde and Hise were also forces in the middle on defense, as Hise had four blocks and Bonde three. Libero Maddie Alessio had 10 digs and even added a kill late in the match, while Brooklyn Bachmann had 31 assists. \nThe Indians were playing without sophomore standout Alli Papesh, who has been ill. \n“The thing I liked about this match was that we beat Oswego in two earlier in the season, and tonight we had a different lineup and did it again,” Minooka coach Carrie Prosek said. “We do have a lot of weapons we can use, but it’s nice to see that Ginger is slowly starting to take over the role of go-to hitter. \n“With Alli out, we need her more, but Ginger has been building up to this all year. It’s nice to see her senior leadership showing, especially with all the young players we have on the team.” \nGinger Perinar added two more kills as Minooka (15-7, 9-2) took a 7-2 lead in the first set of the Southwest Prairie Conference matchup. Oswego pulled to within 10-8, but two kills from Rocky Perinar helped the Indians move back ahead 13-9. With the score 20-14, Ginger Perinar served two straight aces and, at 24-16, delivered the kill that ended the set. \nOswego hung tough with Minooka in the second set, as the set was tied as late as 14-14. Minooka got three kills from Ginger Perinar to go ahead 19-17, and a kill by Hise made it 20-17. Sydney Arliss came off the bench to serve, and she promptly dropped two aces on the Panthers for a 22-17 lead. A kill by Alessio and a block by Bonde made it 24-19 and it looked like Ginger Perinar ended the match with a kill, but the ball was ruled out. Oswego then drew to within 24-23 before Rocky Perinar finally sealed it with a kill. \n“With Ali being out, it was time to try some other players,” Prosek said. ‘Kamryn Johnson did a nice job. It’s nice that we can plug players in and they get the job done. Everyone contributed. \n“I have coached a long time, and I don’t know if I have seen a team that gets along as well as this group of girls does. As the season has gone on, we have really come together. We hope to get Alli back soon. We have a busy next couple of weeks.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:04:54.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
