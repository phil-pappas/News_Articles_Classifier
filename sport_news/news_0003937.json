And among the biggest news nuggets to come out of their interview was that when Christopher Russo left the show, Francesa reached out to Simmons to recruit him as a co-host.\n“We discussed whether there was a possibility I could be the co-host,’’ Simmons said, a statement that a conspicuously-complimentary Francesa confirmed.\n“I only called two people, and you were one. You were one of the few people I’d bring in here, absolutely,’’ said Francessa.\nSimmons : “I thought it was my friend Sal playing a joke on me. You were like ‘How much money do you make? This is Francesa.’”\nMike Francesa and Chris “Mad Dog” Russo in 2007.

It’s noteworthy because not only did they split on less-than-stellar terms, but Francesa has steadfastly refused to cooperate with ESPN, including declining an invite from Simmons to do a 25th anniversary history of WFAN.\n“I know for a fact that Dog agreed to do 30 for 30,’’ Francesa said of Russo, who left for a lucrative satellite radio deal in 2008.\nSimmons broached the idea of Francesa and Russo reuniting, but Francesa said the economics simply wouldn’t work because they each make more separately than they would as a tandem.\n“We’d have to agree to it for much less than we make now … We have not discussed it,’’ said Francesa. “I’d never ever be against a reunion sometime. But it’s hard to do economically, like a lot of things.”\nJust like it was impossible to get Francesa and Simmons together, with the “Sports Guy” having just re-signed with ESPN. That marriage recently went sour, with Simmons pointing to his criticisms of NFL commissioner Roger Goddell – and refusal to back down – as the beginning of the end. He got suspended and then later fired, saying Wednesday that he learned of his termination on Twitter.\n“I had a mostly happy run there, spotty times like in any (relationship). Mike & Mike aren’t going to cause problems, say anything inflammatory. They’re going to represent the brand, which is fine,’’ said Simmons, who has no problem doing inflammatory, and showed that by going after the NFL.\n“It was really the Goodell thing. They suspended me for three weeks. They almost fired me.’’\nAnd looking back, Simmons said on Wednesday that the NFL brought pressure to bear on ESPN to get him off the air.\n“I do. It’s their biggest partner by far. I didn’t think Roger Goddell was being honest about the Ray Rice thing,’’ said Simmons when asked whether he was suspended more for attacking Goodell or for criticizing other ESPN personnel.\n“It was unclear because the story kind of changed from their end, depending on who I was talking to and what day of the week it was.’’\n bill simmons , chris russo , espn , mike francesa , roger goodell , wfan", "external_links": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/francesa2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=210", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/francesa2.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:12:55.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
