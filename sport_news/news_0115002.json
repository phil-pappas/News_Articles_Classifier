He struck out eight and walked none the night after teammate Clayton Kershaw fanned 11 while losing his fifth straight postseason game.\nRuben Tejada is hit by a sliding Chase Utley.

Bartolo Colon relieved, and Howie Kendrick hit a grounder up the middle. Second baseman Daniel Murphy flipped to Tejada, who took the throw awkwardly for an apparent force as Utley slid past the bag and slammed into him, causing Tejada to flip over as the tying run scored from third.\nThe Mets said Tejada sustained a fractured right fibula. Utley was ruled safe on a video review, which determined Tejada's foot missed the bag. Utley also appeared not to touch the base.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nAdrian Gonzalez followed with a two-run double off Addison Reed and scored on Justin Turner's double.\nSyndergaard (0-1) gave up three runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings for the Mets. He struck out nine and walked four in following up Jacob deGrom's 13-strikeout performance in winning game one.\nGame three is in New York on Monday, when Brett Anderson tries to pitch the Dodgers back into the best-of-five series against the Mets' Matt Harvey.\nIn St. Louis, Kyle Hendricks and Addison Russell had successful squeeze bunts and Jorge Soler capped a five-run second with a two-run homer to lead the Cubs.\nThe usually steady NL Central champion Cardinals made two errors as the Cubs didn't hit the ball out of the infield in scoring their first three runs in the second.\nPlaying in his first postseason game, Soler connected off Jaime Garcia (0-1), who was lifted because of a stomach ailment after the second inning. Besides the two-run homer, Soler doubled and walked twice in the Cubs' first postseason victory since 2003. Chicago had lost seven straight Division Series games.\nGame three is in Chicago on Monday, where the Cubs' 22-game winner Jake Arrieta faces St. Louis' Michael Wacha.\nAP", "external_links": ["http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=521590283&topic_id=94784514&width=400&height=224&property=mlb"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:33:51.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
