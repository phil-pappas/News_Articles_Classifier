Pitino promises answers in emotional speech Louisville basketball coach Rick Pitino took time to address the recent paid escort allegations made by Katina Powell in her new book \"Breaking Cardinal Rules\" during Cards annual luncheon event.

I haven't read them in years\" – for a recent column claiming U of L has nurtured a dangerous culture toward women. He said he was \"blindsided\" by radio host Terry Meiners in an interview last week, during which Meiners, a friend of Pitino's, asked the coach if he intended to resign.

There's a lot of ifs here – if it did happen. And the ifs are not being answered, and they have to be answered by the NCAA. \n\"I'm not allowed to talk to any players about it. I'm not allowed to do any investigating on my own, which is fine by me. But I do know this: If there was any wrongdoing – that's a big 'if' – then people have to pay for their crimes. And that's an 'if.' If it happens, we will own up to it and do the best we can under adverse situations.\" U of L luncheon | Pitino delves into scandal \nU of L's Hall of Fame coach did weave some thoughts on his current team throughout his words, saying it could be the best shot-blocking team he has had. But, he said, he admitted to them in practice that he was down about the fallout from the book's allegations. \nDavid Ridpath, an expert in compliance and NCAA enforcement issues who is a professor at Ohio University, said last week that one of the most difficult parts about investigations is that they \"hang over your head,\" because they require such an exhaustive, comprehensive amount of research. \nAfter the team's first Red-White intrasquad scrimmage two Saturdays ago, Pitino said he would channel his focus, emotion and time into basketball, though he has acknowledged several times in the past 10 days that he has had trouble sleeping. \nOn Tuesday, Pitino said he told his players that they \"lift me up, because I've never had a group like this in my life.\" In raving about the team's chemistry and character, something he has done since May, Pitino pulled out his phone to read a text message from one of the team's leaders. \n\"He said, 'The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy,'\" Pitino began. \"'We have something very special on our horizon, and this attack on our program is just verification. The Bible says that no weapon formed against you shall prosper, but it never said that it wouldn't form. I serve a God who can use our problems to bring glory to his name. Have no fear, Coach. I love you.'\" Transcript: Pitino's Tipoff Luncheon speech \nThe crowd roared with an extended applause. Pitino cracked a joke. Then he closed with a flourish, expressing his gratitude to his friends and family and the U of L fan base's support. \n\"We'll get through this the right way, and whatever sits upon us, we will find out with the right people investigating,\" he said. \"We won't go by hearsay. I know what this program is all about. I feel very, very confident in what the players are all about. And this group that you're going to see on Saturday (in a second preseason scrimmage), you're going to see something really special. I think we can go very far. \n\"They will do great things on the basketball court, and they'll represent you exactly the way you'd want of a Louisville basketball player.\" \nFollow U of L hoops writer Jeff Greer on Twitter ( @jeffgreer_cj ) for regular Cards updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:31:35.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
