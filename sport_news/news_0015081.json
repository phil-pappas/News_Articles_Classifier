Brees moved the Saints to the Atlanta six, but New Orleans gained only two yards on three plays. \nOn fourth-and-goal from the four, instead of settling for a chip-shot field goal, Saints coach Sean Payton sent the offense back on the field. \nBrees drew an encroachment penalty on defensive tackle Ra'Shede Hageman with a hard count, but the Saints still faced fourth down from the two. Brees faked a handoff to Ingram and Watson ran free in the back of the end zone to haul in an easy toss for a 24-7 lead. \nhe Falcons (5-1) had rallied for victories in the fourth quarter for four of their previous five wins, but they could not get closer than 10 points late in Thursday's game. \nQuarterback Matt Ryan completed 30 of 44 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns, but was sacked five times and fumbled three times.
