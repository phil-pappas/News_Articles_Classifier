Image 10 of 10 A United feeling: Abbott Tech/Immaculate football co-op working on and off the field 1 / 10 Back to Gallery \nDANBURY — From two separate worlds, they gathered in the Abbott Tech auditorium in the spring of 2014 to discuss a bold plan to save two struggling football programs. \nAs the players and families from crosstown rivals Abbott Tech and Immaculate High filed into the auditorium, all the Abbott Tech families sat on one side of the auditorium, and all the Immaculate families congregated on the other. \nAnd so began the arranged marriage. \nThe teams represented pieces from two vastly different puzzles — one a private, Roman Catholic school where the students wear crisp, dressy uniforms to school each day; the other a public, technical high school where students wear a uniform of work boots and safety goggles as they learn their trades. \nAnd then, in the midst of all the apprehension swirling in the auditorium that day, coach Rich Holmes stood up and encouraged the families from the two schools to sit together. \nIt was the only way this bold plan — the Abbott Tech/Immaculate football co-op — would work. The teams had to come together as one. \nPlayers, parents, school communities. Everyone. \n“He set the tone right from the beginning,” Immaculate athletic director Jeff Castaldi said of Holmes, the head coach at Abbott Tech for a season before being named the head coach of the ATI co-op in 2014. \nThe co-op — appropriately named the United — is four games into its second season \nIn determining whether this unlikeliest of partnerships has been successful, it’s important to first consider where the two programs were as separate entities. Immaculate had entered the 2013 season having not not won a varsity game since Oct. 10, 2009. After an 0-6 start to the 2013 season under coach Tom Taylor , the shorthanded Mustangs forfeited their final five varsity games. Immaculate hadn’t had a winning football team since the late Steve Kaplanis led the Mustangs to the Class S state semifinals in 2003. \nAcross town, meanwhile, Abbott Tech had played its first varsity schedule in 2009 under the direction of coach Chris Mascolo , and in 2012 posted its first winning season with a 6-4 record. In 2013, the undermanned Wolverines went 4-7 in Holmes’ first year at the helm. By the end of the season, the Wolverines didn’t have enough players in uniform to hold a full 11-on-11 scrimmage at practice. During games, many of the Wolverines’ best players never came off the field, they simply transitioned from offense to defense to special teams. \nBy the end of the 2013, it had become obvious to folks on both sides of town that something needed to be done. Something drastic, perhaps unconventional, and certainly controversial. \n“It got to the point, obviously, when Immaculate dropped football, they had no choice,” Holmes said. “And we had a real numbers problem, too. It was a natural marriage, but there were a lot of concerns on both sides about how it was going to work.” \nNow, consider this: This week, the United players and coaches have been working tirelessly in preparation for what will be the biggest football game either school has played in a long time. Winners of their first four games, the unbeaten United will look to make it five straight when it hosts fellow unbeaten Constitution State Conference contender Harding Friday at 7 p.m. at Immaculate High’s Mustang Valley. The game will coincide with Immaculate’s homecoming and its celebration commemorating the 50th anniversary of its first graduating class. Several thousand spectators are expected. \n“It’s going to be the biggest game of our careers,” ATI senior co-captain Dominique Rogers of Abbott Tech said following Wednesday’s practice at Immaculate. \nAnd he’s right. This will be the biggest game of their careers — for now, at least. The more they win, the higher the stakes will go and the bigger the games will get. \n“None of them have played in a game this big in high school,” Holmes said Wednesday. “Some have played Pop Warner games, some have basketball games that were pretty big, but none of them have played in a football game this big in high school. I’m interested to see how they respond.” \nWin or lose on Friday night, the simple facts that the team even exists and is doing so well are tremendous victories unto themselves. \n“When (Abbott Tech athletic director) Jon Nadeau and I first got together to discuss the possibility of the co-op, we both thought that, even though we had two schools from varying backgrounds, it would be a home run, not only from an educational standpoint, but from a community standpoint as well,” Castaldi said. “A lot of these kids know each other. They play against each other in other sports, they’ve been playing against each other since they’ve been in rec leagues and Pop Warner and basketball leagues and what have you. We thought it would not only save the programs, but that it would be a home run. \n“It’s been more than just a success on the field. It’s been a success in bringing both schools together, both the players and the parents.” \nThat’s not to say, however, that the transition was seamless or that the team chemistry instantaneous. Keep in mind that these two schools share a rivalry in some sports, like basketball, that goes back generations (a rivalry which will no doubt be rekindled when the players turn in their shoulder pads and hit the hardwood). \n“At first, I didn’t really like them, but the chemistry’s gotten a lot better,” ATI senior co-captain Steve Bohling of Immaculate joked, knowing full well that a group of his teammates was standing nearby, well within earshot. “We meshed really well. Some of them are like my best friends now.” \nOf course, on a team with more players, the competition for playing time becomes that much tougher. \n“There are some kids from both schools who, if Immaculate and Abbott Tech were separate, would have been playing, but who aren’t playing now. No doubt about it,” Holmes said. “So, the question comes in: Would you rather be on a sub-par team and play, or be on a good team and not play? That is what the question comes down to. And they get it. They understand.” \nAnd for the parents, who in years past could only watch helplessly from the sidelines while their kids’ teams struggled mightily to compete on the gridiron, the ATI football alliance has been a blessing. \n“I’ll be honest with you, in the beginning, before it even started, I had my apprehensions,” said Lisa Henley , mother of Immaculate senior football player Griffin Henley . “However, it’s been fantastic. The kids are great, and they’ve all bonded. It’s a good, positive thing. They get along on the field and outside of football.” \nThe intention of the co-op from Day 1 was to build the Immaculate and Abbott Tech programs back up to where they could stand on their own again. Castaldi said the co-op would be in place for at least two more seasons after this one. \nLast season, their first as a co-op, the United posted an 8-3 record, narrowly missing the Class M state tournament. They finished ninth in the state playoff rankings; the top eight qualify. \n“Our objective this year is to compete for the league title and make the states,” Holmes said. “Those are our goals.” \nAnd that’s what makes Friday’s game against Harding so important. A win would be a big step toward both those goals, not to mention a tremendous boost to a program that is in the process of rising from the ashes. \n“They’re a really good team. They’re 4-0, just like us,” ATI senior co-captain Darius Smith of Immaculate said Wednesday about Harding. “It’s the 50th anniversary of our school and we have a lot of people coming back to see us play. I just want to put on a good show for the people coming back and show them what we’ve made Immaculate football like again.” \nAnd show them what two groups can accomplish when they become United. \nrgregory@newstimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:06:10.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
