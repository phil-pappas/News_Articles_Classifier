(AP) - The Kansas City Royals have established a reputation for dramatic postseason comebacks the past couple of years, beginning with last season's wild-card victory over Oakland.\nTurns out, the Toronto Blue Jays have some never-say-quit spirit as well.\nAfter going on a second-half run to make the playoffs, then rallying from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Texas in a best-of-five matchup, the Blue Jays will try to beat the Royals in another win-or-else situation in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series on Friday night.\nToronto forced the series back to Kansas City with a 7-1 rout on Wednesday, closing to 3-2.\nLEADING OFF \nRoyals host Blue Jays in Game 6 of ALCS\n(AP) - After winning a 7-1 rout in Game 5, the Blue Jays will try to survive another win-or-else contest against the Royals in Game 6 at Kansas City.\nToronto also rallied from a 2-0 deficit to beat Texas in the best-of-five AL Division Series and have won four straight this postseason while facing elimination.\n\"You look at all the elimination games, our offense has really come to life,\" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said Thursday. \"We've said all along that's the key to our team, scoring runs. You hate to make a habit of it, but maybe we can pull it off again.\"\nToronto will send out ace David Price, who was outstanding down the stretch but has disappointed this postseason.\nMost recently, he pitched six shutout innings in Game 2 before surrendering five runs in the seventh. He has a 7.02 ERA in three appearances in these playoffs, with his lone win coming in a relief outing in Game 4 against Texas.\nBROWNS-RAMS CAPSULE \nBrowns face Rams this weekend\n(AP) - The Cleveland Browns face the St. Louis Rams this weekend.\nThe Rams have won three of four in series. Both teams have lost three of last four this season.\nThis will be St. Louis' first home game since Sept. 27. In the Rams last meeting with the Browns, Phil Dawson made four field goals but missed potential winning kick near two-minute warning after snap was bounced.\nThe Browns have gone to OT last two games, beating Baltimore two weeks ago and losing last week to Denver. They were driving for potential winning field goal before Josh McCown was intercepted for second time with 44 seconds left in regulation against Broncos.\nRams rookie RB Todd Gurley has rushed for 305 yards with 6.2-yard average over last two games. Nick Foles threw four interceptions last week after totaling one in first four games.\nCHIEFS-PLUGGING HOLES \nChiefs find depth tested as injuries pry open roster holes\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Andy Reid was never under any pretense that Jamaal Charles was irreplaceable.\nShortly after the four-time Pro Bowl running back went down with a season-ending ACL injury, the Chiefs coach was among the first to acknowledge the difficulty in replacing him.\nSo far, that challenge has proven to be bigger than even Reid estimated.\nIn their first game without No. 25 in the backfield, the Chiefs were bottled up a week ago by the Minnesota Vikings. Charcandrick West ran for 33 yards, Knile Davis managed just 13 more on five carries, and the Chiefs finished with 57 yards rushing in a 16-10 defeat.\nIn the five games before Charles was hurt? The Chiefs averaged 110 yards on the ground.\n\"There were some positive things that are going to get overlooked because we didn't win the game,\" Reid said. \"Charcandrick did some nice things - nice things, really.\"\nThen again, he also fumbled late in the game, squandering a chance at a go-ahead touchdown.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
