The Tigers beat Oxford last week in the regular-season finale, 43-26, with Manuel rushing for 177 yards and two scores. (Photo: Journal file) Story Highlights Manuel has run for 7,116 career yards; the old section record was 4,715, set by END's Joel Stephens Groton travels to Deposit/Hancock on Friday night for its first-round sectional game Lansing and Watkins Glen/O-M tangle on Saturday night, with the winner taking the Division V title State power Maine-Endwell, winner of 58 straight, hosts winless Ithaca on Friday at Spartan Stadium CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAlthough it seems like just yesterday that the Friday night lights illuminated late-summer skies, Section 4 Conference football is hurtling toward playoff time -- unless you're talking about Class D, in which case the \"second season\" is already here. \nThree quarterfinal matchups are on tap for Friday night, with four-time defending champion Tioga hosting No. 8 Oxford in a rematch of their regular-season finale, second-seeded Deposit/Hancock playing host to No. 7 Groton and No. 3 seed Elmira Notre Dame welcoming sixth seed Moravia. The fourth playoff matchup features No. 5 Harpursville/Afton traveling to Walton on Saturday afternoon to take on the fourth-seeded Warriors. \nTioga, champion of Division VII, brings a 6-1 overall record into Friday's game, with its lone defeat coming four weeks ago at the hands of Class C Newark Valley, 35-32. The Tigers are led by all-everything back Jesse Manuel, who rushed for 177 yards and two scores on 23 carries in last Friday's 43-26 defeat of Oxford, which clinched Tioga its fifth straight Div. VII title. \nThe 5-8, 150-pound Manuel, who set the Section 4 career rushing record last season, is up to 1,439 yards this season and 7,116 for his brilliant four-year career. The previous record, 4,715, was set by Joel Stephens of Elmira Notre Dame (1991-94). Stephens would go on to play baseball in the Baltimore Orioles organization, but died of colon cancer at age 22 in 1998. \nGroton (4-3 overall), which finished tied with Notre Dame and Moravia atop Division VIII at 3-1, is coming off a 42-12 loss to Class C Watkins Glen/Odessa-Montour in its regular-season finale last Friday on Senior Night in Groton. Matt Gombas rushed for 104 yards and a touchdown for the Indians, which finished with 12.0 seeding points and wound up on the short end of a complex tie-breaker with the Crusaders (13.5) and Blue Devils (13.0). \nUnder first-year coach Tom Goddard, a successful coach in western New York for 38 years before coming out of retirement, Groton has come a long way from last season. The Indians went 2-6 in 2014, including a forfeit win over Odessa-Montour and a forfeit loss to Spencer-Van Etten in the wake of a hazing incident involving members of the team. \nThe Indians take on an unbeaten Deposit/Hancock squad (7-0, 5-0 Div. VI) that is ranked fourth in the state and outscored its division foes by a combined 183-50. D/H is led by senior running back Ronnie Ballard, who had 157 yards and two touchdowns last week in a 34-12 home defeat of Delhi. \nD/H's win total is the largest in the six years since Deposit and Hancock merged. The division championship is the first for Hancock in 10 years and the first for Deposit in eight. Friday night's game will be played in Hancock. \nMoravia will be looking for revenge when it meets Notre Dame on Friday. In the teams' regular-season meeting on Sept. 26, Derrick Stark ran for a touchdown and caught a TD pass from Gary Raupers in a 30-8 Crusaders victory. \nJared Lyon, who had the lone Moravia touchdown in that one, ran for 347 yards and five touchdowns last Saturday in a 56-34 defeat of Spencer-Van Etten. He eclipsed the single-season school record of 1,332, set in 1999 by Corey Raner, and stands at 1,436. \nIn Class C, Lansing travels to Watkins Glen on Saturday night to take on WG/Odessa-Montour for the Division V championship. Both teams are already assured of a spot in sectionals, but a division title will likely mean a first-round date with a team other than two-time defending state champion Chenango Forks. \nLast week, the Bobcats (2-5, 2-0 Div. V) were forced to forfeit to Forks when school officials reported an insufficient number of healthy players. The state minimum for football is 16 in order to compete. On Tuesday, Lansing director of athletics Adam Heck said the team had 20 players at Monday's practice. \nThe other Division V matchup pits Dryden (4-3, 0-2) against Thomas A. Edison (2-5, 0-2), with the Purple Lions looking to build off of last week's 45-12 rout of Oneonta. The win ended a three-game losing streak that swept Dryden out of postseason contention. \nAmong this week's large-school matchups is what, on paper, would appear to be a huge mismatch: Maine-Endwell, which has won four consecutive state titles and 58 games in a row, welcomes winless Ithaca to Spartan Stadium on Friday for a 7 p.m. kickoff. The Little Red (0-7, 0-4 Div. I) has lost 31 games since it last tasted victory, a 48-35 defeat of Johnson City in week 3 of the 2012 season. \nMaine-Endwell thumped Union-Endicott last weekend, 37-7, while Ithaca fell behind 28-0 early in the third quarter and wound up losing, 28-20, to Rome Free Academy out of Section 3. Junior quarterback Turner DePalma threw for one touchdown and ran for another, and Nazier Landes also had a rushing TD for the Little Red.
