They have let 28 years take over.\"\nElmarr, 58, is charged with one count of first-degree murder in connection with the death of Murphy, 28, who was his ex-wife. A jury convicted him in 2009, and he was sentenced to life in prison with parole possible after 40 years.\nPreviously, the case had gone cold for many years, until a DNA link enabled the filing of charges against Elmarr in 2007.\nThe conviction was overturned because evidence of alternate suspects was not presented to jurors, and the Colorado Supreme Court clarified a law under which the original decision was made and returned the case for retrial.\nDr. John Meyer, a former forensic pathologist with the Boulder County Coroner's Office, testified on Wednesday that Murphy died from ligature strangulation.\nAdvertisement Meyer said the deep slash wound on Murphy's neck was likely inflicted close to the moment of her death or shortly after but the exact time is not definitively known.\nKupfner said that numerous witnesses saw Murphy leave her Longmont employer with Elmarr on May 22, telling two of them that she was going to spend time with her ex-husband.\nAlma \"Charlie\" Antram, Murphy's boss at the time of her disappearance, testified on Wednesday that Murphy asked her to borrow a jacket the day she went missing, because she was going on a motorcycle ride with her ex-husband.\nAntram testified that Murphy briefly introduced her to Elmarr before leaving with him on the morning of May 22. She said she never saw Murphy again.\nAnother one of Murphy's bosses, William Ray, testified on Wednesday that he saw Murphy leave work on May 22 riding on the back of a canary yellow motorcycle, but he did not say who was driving it.\nKupfner said during opening arguments that another witness will testify to seeing the motorcycle — which he said belonged to Elmarr — near the area where hikers later discovered Murphy's body.\nHerold said Elmarr was seen in Longmont two hours after he left with Murphy, which wouldn't have given him sufficient time to drive all the way to Lefthand Canyon and kill Murphy, cover up her body and drive back.\nShe added that Murphy's sister also told police that she had spoken with Carol on the evening of May 22, several hours after the defense contends Elmarr had been seen back in Longmont.\nProsecutors also contend that DNA evidence — which provided the impetus to bring a murder charge against Elmarr — connects Elmarr to Murphy's body, but the defense says it only shows the two had sex, which no one is disputing.\nProsecutors say that in the days following Murphy's death, Elmarr spoke with police numerous times, but continued to add details to his story, at one point saying, \"I haven't been completely honest.\"\nHerold said that two other men, Willie Taylor and Clifton St. Denis , a mentally ill homeless man who confessed at one time to the murder, are viable alternate suspects who could have been responsible for Murphy's death.\nTestimony is expected to resume Thursday morning.\nJohn Bear: 303-684-5212, bearj@timescall.com or twitter.com/johnbearwithme", "external_links": ["http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28879861/mentally-ill-man-okd-alternate-suspect-1987-boulder", "http://twitter.com/johnbearwithme"], "published": "2015-10-14T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:14:26.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
