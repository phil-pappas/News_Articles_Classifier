The Super Bowl champions won their seventh straight game, including the playoffs last season. \nThe Cowboys (2-3) lost their third straight without Romo and his top receiver, and backup Brandon Weeden lost his 11th in a row as a starter. \nALDS-BLUE JAYS-RANGERS \nTulo-led Blue Jays avoid ALDS elimination, beat Texas 5-1 \nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Troy Tulowitzki drove in four runs, including a three-run homer for his first hit this postseason, and the Toronto Blue Jays avoided elimination in the AL Division Series with a 5-1 win over the Texas Rangers in Game 3 on Sunday night. \nThe Blue Jays cut their deficit to 2-1 in the best-of-five matchup. \nTexas has another chance Monday to clinch the series at home. If not, a deciding Game 5 will be played Wednesday in Toronto, where the Rangers won the first two games. \nMarco Estrada limited the Rangers to one run and five hits over 6 1-3 innings. \nTulowitzki's two-out homer in the sixth put the Blue Jays up 5-0. That was two innings after he drew a bases-loaded walk. \nTexas left-hander Martin Perez, somewhat a surprise pick as the Game 3 starter over veterans Derek Holland and Colby Lewis, gave up four runs and six hits. \nHolland (4-3) starts Game 4 against knuckleballer R.A. Dickey (11-11). \nALDS-ROYALS-ASTROS \nAstros take 2-1 series lead over Royals with 4-2 win \nHOUSTON (AP) - Dallas Keuchel remained perfect at home with seven gutsy innings and Chris Carter homered Sunday, leading the Houston Astros to a 4-2 win over the Kansas City Royals to take a 2-1 lead in the American League Division Series. \nThe Astros could wrap up the best-of-five series with a win over the defending AL champions in Game 4 on Monday. \nKeuchel (2-0) worked out of jam after jam, allowing five hits and one run with seven strikeouts after going 15-0 at home this season, a modern major league record. \nLuke Gregerson gave up a leadoff homer in the ninth to Alex Gordon before finishing off the Astros first playoff game in Houston in 10 years with a four-out save. It was save of more than three outs in three years. \nJason Castro drove in two runs with a single in the fifth that made it 2-1. Carlos Gomez, who has a rib muscle strain, started for the first time in the series and had an RBI single in the sixth. \nMAGIC-ROCKETS \nHarden bruises knee in Houston's 123-119 loss to Orlando \nHIDALGO, Texas (AP) - Houston star James Harden scored 12 points before leaving in the second quarter with a bruised right knee and the Orlando Magic went on to a 123-119 exhibition victory over the Rockets on Sunday night. \nHarden was injured when he banged his knee into Evan Fournier playing defense on a fast break. He walked gingerly off the court and didn't return. Coach Kevin McHale said after the game that he didn't have any more information on Harden's injury. \nDwight Howard didn't play for the second straight game and Corey Brewer led the Rockets with 20 points. \nDevyn Marble had 21 points to lead the Magic. Fournier had 19 points and four assists. Mario Hezonja added 13 points and had six rebounds and a block. \nOrlando visits the Miami Heat on Tuesday night. The Rockets travel to Phoenix to play the Suns on Tuesday night. \nALDS-BUSH-FIRST PITCH \nGeorge H.W. Bush tosses 1st pitch at Game 3 of ALDS \nHOUSTON (AP) - Former President George H.W. Bush, in a wheelchair and wearing a neck brace, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of the American League Division Series between the Houston Astros and Kansas City Royals on Sunday. \nThe 91-year-old Bush, recovering after breaking a vertebra in his neck in a summer spill, smiled broadly when the crowd cheered after he was brought onto the field. With wife Barbara by his side, he bounced a short throw from about five feet in front of the plate to Houston's Jed Lowrie, who was set up to catch. \nBush is a longtime Astros fan with a home in Houston, and for years he attended dozens of games a year in seats just behind home plate. \nNORTH TEXAS-INTERIM COACH \nCanales chosen interim coach at North Texas \nDENTON, Texas (AP) - Mike Canales is getting a second chance as interim coach at North Texas. \nThe Mean Green's offensive coordinator was chosen interim coach for the rest of the season Sunday, a day after coach Dan McCarney was fired following a 66-7 homecoming loss to FCS team Portland State. \nCanales also served as interim coach for the final five games of the 2010 season after former coach Todd Dodge was fired midseason. North Texas went 2-3. \nNorth Texas (0-5) has a home game Thursday night against Western Kentucky. \nThe Mean Green finished 4-8 last year. \nT25-COLLEGE FB POLL \nSic'em: Baylor reaches No. 2 in AP Top 25 behind Ohio State \n(AP) - Baylor is No. 2 and Utah is up to fourth behind No. 1 Ohio State in The Associated Press college football poll. \nThe Bears have their best ranking ever. They reached No. 3 three times previously, including once last season. \nVoters spread first-place votes around to six teams in the Top 25 released Sunday. The Buckeyes received 27, down 11 (38) from last week. Baylor has 13 and Utah has 16. No. 3 TCU received three first-place votes and No. 5 Clemson and No. 9 Texas A&M each received one. \nOhio State started the season a unanimous No. 1, but as the Buckeyes have sputtered support has slipped. Ohio State pulled away from Maryland in the second half Saturday for a 49-28 victory. \nNow, there isn't much separation in the top four. The Buckeyes have 1,411 poll points, 21 more than Baylor. TCU is four points ahead of Utah. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
