With over 30,000 gyms and fitness clubs in the U.S. alone, it can surprise fitness outsiders to know that one of the greatest problems is a unique workout.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275706\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275707\nThe majority of gyms today share the same boring equipment layouts and focus mainly on demographics when deciding how to separate themselves. Fitness experts everywhere will tell you that boring workouts aren't just bad for your brain, but they can also stop your results dead in the tracks.\nEven with the endless \"class calendars\" and \"Zumba Nights,\" the fitness world is craving a more flexible option. After all, there's only so many times you can step onto the stair-master before you're body stops progressing, and your mind starts to buzz with boredom.\nDropZone Fitness Sugar Land Owner and expert Michele Tandy-Gutierrez sat down for an exclusive interview with the elite Fort Bend news resource, Upclose Magazine, to share their secret to success and their solution to the muscle memory problem.\nThe boutique Sugar Land gym offers diverse and creative fitness options, with an emphasis on their one-of-a-kind \"Rage Cage.\"\n\"When I was designing DropZone, I knew we had to add a 'Rage Cage,'\" Michele gushes, refreshingly passionate about the project. \" It might sound intimidating, but it reminded me of my six-year-old son's indoor playscape.\"\nAs the community becomes more fitness-savvy, there is a serious need for more options to reach fitness goals than your standard Thursday afternoon Zumba. It seems like this boutique gym has cracked the code to a sustainable and dynamic fitness experience.\n\"The Rage Cage is essentially a big jungle gym for adults! In one of our year-round 'Cage Classes' you'll work out five days a week with a group using ropes, doing pull-ups, using kettlebells, and having a blast!\" Michele explains, \"You don't have to choose between an aerobic workout, boot camp, sports-training, plyometrics, or weights… DropZone Fitness Sugar Land offers the best of every fitness discipline 24 hours a day.\"\nEngaged in the most important part of the gym experience (real life results) Michele has committed to only hiring credentialed trainers who share her passion and commitment to transforming lives through the power of fitness.\nDropZone has worked tirelessly to make sure that the staff and customers maintain close relationships, \"Knowing you individually means even more than greeting you by name…it means we can recommend routines and machines that will help you reach your goals.\"\nWith specialties like weight management, body sculpting, and even youth sports performance, DropZone has something to offer the entire community and intends to keep it that way.\nSpreading the word through their Facebook page in addition to Michele's personal Instagram and social media outlets, DropZone is picking up as one of Sugar Land's most unique and notable Boutique gyms with no signs of slowing down. Their dedication to creating the most effective, community-centered, and creative workout space has given them a coveted place in the communities' metaphorical heart.\nContact:\nMichele Gutierrez\n832.953.4383\nwww.dropzonesugarland.com\nEmail\n releases/dropzone-fitness-sugar-land-cracks-the-code-to-cutting-edge-fitness-experience-300157452.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.statisticbrain.com/gym-membership-statistics/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=292138", "http://www.dropzonesugarland.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275707", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275706", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dropzone-fitness-sugar-land-cracks-the-code-to-cutting-edge-fitness-experience-300157452.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH24713&Transmission_Id=201510120830PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH24713&DateId=20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:44:35.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
