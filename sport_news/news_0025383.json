Photo by Jayne Kamin-Oncea/For The Signal \nDown by seven in the first half, Valencia gave the ball to running back Jahmar Berkley three times in a row. \nOn the first, he grabbed 2 yards on fourth-and-1 at the Saugus 25. \nThen he rattled off a 10-yard run. \nAnd on his third touch, Berkley rolled out to the right side to tie the score. \nThat was a part of 21 unanswered points that lifted the Vikings to a 21-7 win over the Centurions at College of the Canyons on Friday night. \nBerkley ran for 148 yards on 11 carries and scored two of Valencia’s three touchdowns on the night. \nHis second score sealed the win in the fourth quarter for the Vikings (4-3 overall, 2-0 in Foothill) — a 7-yard run after a quick, backward pitch from quarterback Cole Parkinson. \nParkinson went 6-for-14 for 34 yards with an interception and two fumbles on the night. \nBut the Vikings were the beneficiaries of good field position for most of the evening, and Jermaine Brown picked off Saugus quarterback Louis Eusebi in the second quarter. \nValencia took advantage of the pick as Effie Davalos ran in a score up the right side from 7-yards out. \nDavalos ran for 53 yards on nine carries and a TD. \nEusebi finished the night 12-for-25 and 117 yards in the air. He wasn’t as effective this week on the ground, rushing for 67 yards on 19 attempts. \nHe ran for 153 yards against West Ranch last week. \nThe Cents’ lone touchdown drive was methodical. \nThey went 80 yards in 13 plays (10 rushing) while taking five minutes off the clock. Running back David Aubrey capped the drive off with a 2-yard touchdown run. But it was highlighted by a Eusebi 18-yard run on which he leaped over a defender on third-and-2. \nNeither Valencia and Saugus could get anything going offensively in the second half, though. \nThe first first down for either team didn’t come until the fourth quarter when Saugus began running its no-huddle offense, something it had abandoned in the beginning of the game. \nSaugus head coach Jason Bornn was not on the sideline. It was unclear why the 13-year head coach was not at the helm. \nUp next for Saugus (3-4, 1-1) is a trip to Canyon High.
