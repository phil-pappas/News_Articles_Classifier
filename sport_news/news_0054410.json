These images, just snapshots really, capture the strangeness of space and inversely the mystery that Earth alone (so far as we know) harbors life.\nCheck out all the photos on the Project Apollo Archive Flickr page and read about the curator of these images and much more, Kipp Teague, on these pages ... here and here .\nJake Ellison can be reached at 206-448-8334 or jakeellison@seattlepi.com .
