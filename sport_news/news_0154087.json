And after a 21-0 shutout win for Moundridge over Inman on Friday night to start the districts, the Wildcats can put an 0-4 start in the rearview and look to the future undefeated in the new season at 1-0. “I have emphasized it all year,” Moundridge head coach Matt Cole said. “That, as much as we would like to win every game, our goal, and we have one which is a state championship. Sometimes you set goals for going undefeated or whatever. Well, as soon as you miss that, now you are looking at failure. For us, there is no failure unless we don’t win a state championship. So 1-0 in the district, and concentrating on the district is what we will do, not only this year, but every year that I’m here.” From the opening kickoff, the Wildcat offense wasn’t looking to do anything ornamental. Lining up and physically dominating 1-on-1 battles, allowing sophomore powder keg Damian Calderon feast running the ball all the way down the field. Dylan Sugars finished off the opening drive with a 7-yard touchdown run to give Moundridge a 7-0 lead early. Calderon led the team with 111 yards on the ground. After an Inman penalty wiped out a big play on the Teutons’ first possession, the Wildcats got the ball back and continued to push Inman all the way to the 5, where Sugars got his second touchdown run of the quarter. With a 14-0 Moundridge lead after one quarter, Inman had some mistakes to clean up, but needed one big drive to turn its fortunes around. In the fourth quarter, a couple of turnovers on downs for the Teutons driving in Moundridge territory, one on a pass that was incomplete, and another that was short by inches, stalled promising scoring chances. The Wildcats held Inman off the scoreboard and took a 14-0 lead into the locker room at halftime. With the Teutons sticking around, Joel Holloway left a mountain for Inman to climb late in the third quarter. Holloway took a Moundridge carry around the left side and willed his way into the end zone with a dive for the pylon to give the Wildcats a 21-0 lead with two minutes left in the third quarter. Where Moundridge had struggled to grab wins there for the taking in close games throughout most of the first fourth weeks, the Wildcats slammed the door shut on Inman in Week 5. “If we go into this game 3-1, maybe we don’t play this well,” Cole said. “But these guys kept believing in each other. We have four things we tell them to believe in. Believe you can win. Believe in each other. Believe in our philosophy, in our system, and believe in themselves. And they continued that through all that adversity, even that game we looked horrible in. So that’s all it was, was them continuing to believe.” Page 2 of 2 - Facing an 0-1 start to the district, with four games left to play, Inman took to the air to look for a score the Teutons could use to build for next week. With less than a minute left to play and the clock ticking, Inman had one last chance to score with a first and goal from the 5-yard line. Moundridge senior Connor Enyart ended the Teuton bid for points with an interception that cemented the 21-0 win. Inman quarterback Keaton Case completed eight passes for 91 yards in the game. “To me, this is a perfect example of small-town Kansas football, district football,” Cole said. “And I am excited for our kids because they not only believe they can win, but they have proven that they can win.” Contact Mike Mendez at mmendez@mcphersonsentinel.com and follow him on Twitter @MendezSentinel.
