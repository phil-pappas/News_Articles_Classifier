This divorce was particularly harsh. \nJenkins was a first-round pick by the Saints in 2009, where he played cornerback as a rookie. He helped them win a Super Bowl that season. Over the next 4 years he converted to safety, a lower-paying positions, and engaged with the struggling New Orleans community. \nThe Saints repaid Jenkins by paying Byrd $54 million over 6 years. \nJenkins landed in Philadelphia for 3 years and $15.5 million. \nKnee issues have limited Byrd to six games for the Saints, who are 8-13 since Byrd arrived. \nJenkins has not only started all 21 games as an Eagle but he has played almost every single snap, and the Eagles are 12-9. He has been the team's best defensive back, if not its best defender, with a team-best 149 tackles since his arrival. \nOne tackle he did not make yesterday cost the Eagles 46 yards, when Brandin Cooks beat Jenkins deep. But, on the whole, Jenkins was as disruptive as ever. \nOn the Saints' first offensive play, Jenkins slipped a block and dropped running back C.J. Spiller for a 3-yard loss. Later on that drive Jenkins blitzed and drew a double-team, which freed Bennie Logan for a 7-yard sack that ensured the Saints would punt. In the second quarter, Jenkins dropped Spiller for a 5-yard loss that again pushed the Saints beyond feasible field-goal range. \nJenkins wasn't the only Saint whose exodus from the Big Easy in 2014 was uneasy. \nThe Eagles traded a measly fifth-round draft pick for scat-back and punt returner Darren Sproles, who proceeded to earn a Pro Bowl spot in 2014. But Sproles, at least, was nearly 31, and his production was diminishing, if only slightly. \nSproles finished yesterday's grudge match with five rushes for 27 yards and a 10-yard reception, but the Saints often double-teamed him, which freed up other receivers. His potential to flip the field as a punt returner led the Saints to sabotage their own kicking game; they never gave him a chance. \nThey punted away from Sproles but they could not avoid Jenkins. \nHe was just too smooth.
