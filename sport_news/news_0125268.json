Rookie left-hander Steven Matz is set for Game 4, followed by Game 1 winner Matt Harvey on Thursday, if needed. \n“They don’t have the credentials that Kershaw and Greinke and Lester and Arrieta have, but they’re going to be good pitchers,” Mets manager Terry Collins said. “We think we can stack up with anybody.” \nChicago goes with Kyle Hendricks in Game 3. If the long-downtrodden Cubs are to reach the World Series for the first time since 1945, they must first force the best-of-seven NLCS back to Citi Field next weekend. \n“We’re all about one-game winning streaks,” Chicago manager Joe Maddon said. “I know it’s psychobabble 101, but it actually works.” \nAfter homering off Kershaw, Greinke and Lester, Murphy added his fifth home run of the postseason, giving him eight RBIs in seven games. \nHe’s one from matching Carlos Beltran’s record of homering in five straight postseason games. \n“He’s about as locked in as I’ve seen a hitter,” Wright said. \nLong, blond locks flowing out the back of his cap, Syndergaard seems to be taking on a bit of Harvey’s cockiness. He gained the nickname Thor — the Norse god known for fierce storms — after he tweeted a photo of himself in costume doing squats on Halloween two years ago. \nAhead of his start against the Cubs, Syndergaard changed the photo atop his Twitter page to a shot featuring lightning striking Chicago’s famous Willis Tower. \nHaving made the first relief appearance of his big league career in Game 5 against the Dodgers, Syndergaard came out throwing darts at up to 99 mph until the sixth, when Dexter Fowler singled and scored on Kris Byrant’s two-out double off the left-field wall. \n“It makes pitching a lot more easy when you go out there and offense puts a three-spot on one of the best pitchers in the game right now,” Syndergaard said. \nArrieta, who wore short sleeves, had not given up a first-inning run in 25 consecutive starts since May 29. With his velocity down slightly, he found himself trailing after nine pitches and down 3-0 after 13. \nGranderson singled through the shift into right field for his ninth hit in 22 postseason at-bats. Wright, in a 1-for-19 playoff slide, drove a fastball on a hop off the center-field wall with Granderson running.d \nMurphy hit an 0-1 pitch about 10 feet to the foul side of the right-field pole, then reached down for a shin-high curveball and with a one-handed swing sent it just inside the pole. Murphy raised his right fist in triumph while rounding first base and took a curtain call after a prolonged ovation. \n“The ambush early got us,” Maddon said. \nGranderson made his dashing defensive play in the second, leaping to get his glove to the top of the 8-foot wall just to the right of straightaway center. \n“I was able to time it up, reel it in,” Granderson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:28:09.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
