It's not how the offensive linemen at Colorado State are wired.\nThe fact remains, injuries have led to constant mixing and matching along the front. The Rams have used eight different linemen regularly, seven making up three starting combinations five weeks into the season. That doesn't take into account the combinations used throughout the week as players have missed practice time.\nLast weekend, Utah State put lots of pressure on quarterback Nick Stevens, sacking him three times, with seven additional hurries. In the process, the CSU run game that had been productive fell short.\nJust don't blame the swapping of linemen.\n\"I don't think so. I mean, if somebody is getting the job done, they're getting the job done,\" said guard Fred Zerblis, who has been one of two constants, along with Sam Carlson. \"I don't think in any of the rotations we've been doing we haven't practiced before. It's just giving us more of a diverse line.\"\nOverall, Colorado State coach Mike Bobo felt the group has played well this season, no matter which players are making up the unit. But he also accepts the fact that constant change has affected continuity.\n\"There's no question when there's injuries, but we've been preparing to play multiple guys and get them in situations,\" he said. \"In the long run, it's going to help. You have to go through growing pains, you have to go through stuff that makes you cringe as a coach when you don't get something, but when you don't have those constant reps and constant communication, sometimes that happens.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:06:10.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
