( Mark Leffingwell / Staff Photographer ) \nRocky Mountain Shootout \nWhere: Buffalo Ranch course on CU South Campus. \nWomen: 5.8K race begins at 9 a.m. \nMen: 8K race begins at 9:45 a.m. \nCost: Parking and admission are free. \nMorgan Pearson assumed the 2014 season would be his final campaign with the University of Colorado cross country program. \nHaving been a solid contributor for two previous CU teams after transferring from Duke, Pearson trained that summer with the sort of zest and fury typical of runners nearing the finish lines of their collegiate careers. Then the season started, and Pearson wasn't quite sure what was going on. \nThe annual Rocky Mountain Shootout came and went and Pearson wasn't in the Buffs' lineup. The same thing happened at the NCAA Pre-National Invitational and the Pac-12 Championships. \nUltimately, coach Mark Wetmore explained to Pearson that he would be a bigger help to the Buffs in 2015 than 2014, when CU was good enough to capture the program's fifth NCAA championship since 2001 without him. \nBack in the fold for what truly will be his final season as a Buff, Pearson and his CU teammates face their first big challenge of the season Saturday at the annual Rocky Mountain Shootout. \n\"I trained all summer as if (2014) was going to be my last season,\" Pearson said. \"After Pac-12s I actually warmed up with the team at nationals. If someone would've fallen in a ditch and broken their leg I probably would've raced. But now I'm excited to have a full year.\" Advertisement \nThe native of Mount Vernon, N.J., began his collegiate career at Duke but, after transferring, made an immediate impact during his first season at CU in 2012, finishing 34th at regionals and serving as an alternate at the NCAA finals. \nAs a junior he paced CU with a seventh-place finish at the NCAA Pre-Nationals and eventually placed 17th at the NCAA finals, where the Buffs claimed the team title. Even if it made sense in the big picture, those previous performances made it difficult to sit and watch in 2014. \n\"I guess the toughest part for me was that I didn't know if I was going to redshirt or not,\" Pearson said. \"I was training like I was going to race if they needed to put me in. At the beginning that was fine, but as the races went down I didn't want my last season to wind up being one race.\" \nThe CU men enter the weekend ranked No. 1 in the nation with the women's program ranked second, up one spot from the season's previous two polls. \n\"Generally, this is a meet against ourselves, and against CU of the past and the performances that are in the books for that day,\" Wetmore said. \"They take it seriously, especially the seniors, for whom it's their last chance to write their names in that book. So they'll be running pretty hard, and if the conditions are good we'll see how they stack up.\" \nPearson finished 10th at the Rocky Mountain Shootout in 2012 and placed seventh a year later, but both times he ran unattached. He is looking forward to his first and last opportunity to wear the CU logo at the program's signature home meet. \n\"I'm excited but I'm trying not to get too excited yet. There's still a long ways to go,\" Pearson said. \"I'd like to win and I don't feel bad about saying that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:45:51.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
