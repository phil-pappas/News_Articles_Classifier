That combo has intercepted 17 passes each in their careers, making them the NCAA active leaders in the category. ( Kyle Green / Idaho Statesman ) \nFORT COLLINS — Boise State coach Bryan Harsin called it the key to his team's success, while at Colorado State, getting a grip on the issue has continued to be a roadblock. \nThe topic at hand is turnovers, an area where the Broncos have excelled and the Rams have not in 2015. For both teams, it's not just one half of the ledger against the other, but both sides working in tandem. \n\"We want to win. That's the number one thing I talk about with the guys, so they understand it,\" Harsin said. \"They're all very smart when it comes to the key ingredient when it comes to be a successful football team, it's turnovers. I think that's showed up in the games, and when you can go back and point it out and go, 'OK, here's why we won the game, because we had this many turnovers, we didn't give up any and we scored every time we got one,' for example. If we continue that, we can win.\" \nWhile the Broncos rank in the top 10 in the country in terms of turnover margin (eighth), the Rams are near the bottom (121st). Boise State is plus-8 in the category, having turned the ball over five times while collecting 13. As the season has extended, the Broncos are only getting better as new quarterback Brett Rypien has yet to throw an interception. \nColorado State is the opposite, creating just five this season while giving away 14, including an astounding eight fumbles. Defensively, it has gone three games this season without creating a turnover. \nThe Rams head into the contest knowing every yard may count, but tight end Kivon Cartwright said every ball carrier has to be mindful of the team they're facing. Advertisement \n\"It's little things. It's always good to fight for extra yardage, but you gotta be smart about things like that with Boise, because they're going to stand you up and rip the ball out,\" he said. \"The little things about when you're around people, don't swing the ball around. Those are just good football fundamentals. If you don't pay attention to those, they will make you pay.\" \nHarsin sees the internal battle within the BSU secondary helping to fuel the competition for his entire team. Safety Darian Thompson and cornerback Donte Deayon each have 17 career interceptions, tying them as the active leaders in the NCAA. Thompson has four this season, while Deayon has three — or one more than the entire CSU roster. \nThose figures are not lost on Colorado State or quarterback Nick Stevens, who has been intercepted five times this season. \n\"The big thing is just taking care of the ball and don't fumble, try to make all the right reads, and if I have to throw the ball away to avoid an interception, then throw the ball away,\" Stevens said. \nAn easy remedy in theory, and CSU coach Mike Bobo said the Broncos' zone coverage feeds off other teams' mistakes. If a throw is ill-timed or sails, there is a Bronco there to haul it in. Throw in steady pressure from a pass rush, those mistakes happen with more regularity. \nBobo said Stevens can't be late and definitely must trust what he sees and react to it immediately. \n\"The thing is sometimes you question your throws or question what you see,\" Bobo said. \"You've got to believe in what you see, how you prepare to throw the ball. The easy thing to do — the real easy thing to do is, like I told him — is blame the quarterback. That's the easy thing to do in football is blame the quarterback and then you start to question yourself and what you're about and your ability, because you're listening to noise.\" \nBobo said the only noise that matters will come from himself and quarterbacks coach Ronnie Letson this week at practice and during Saturday's game. For Stevens to really trust the play, the other half of the equation is just as important. \n\"We've got to be on the same page,\" tight end Kivon Cartwright said. \"Just as Nick identifies the coverage, the receivers and the tight ends, we also have to identify the coverage. We've got to know where the holes are, we've got to know where he's expecting us to be and when he's expecting us to be there. It takes both of us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:04:07.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
