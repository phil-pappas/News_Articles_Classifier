David Jablonski/Staff By Justin Boggs Staff Writer \nAs No. 1 Ohio State is ready to welcome Maryland as its homecoming guest Saturday, Maryland's athletics department is considering dismissing coach Randy Edsall according to reports. \nInsideMDSports is reporting that Edsall, a 57-year-old who is in his fifth year at Maryland, will be released from his contract following this Saturday's contest at Ohio State. The Terrapins have started the season 2-3 after last week's 28-0 loss at Michigan. \nOn June 30, Kevin Anderson, Maryland's director of athletics, announced the university was extending Edsall's contract through 2019. \nEdsall led Maryland through its transition from the Atlantic Coast Conference to the Big Ten. Since Edsall was hired, Maryland has gone 22-33, with only two apperances in bowl games. Maryland lost both contests. \nOhio State won last year's meeting 52-24 in the first contest between the two teams as conference foes. \nDespite the Buckeyes' offense struggling in recent games, Ohio State is a 33-point favorite at home versus Maryland. Ohio State has not beaten Vegas' spread the last four games.
