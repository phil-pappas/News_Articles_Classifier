Those in attendance got some face time with the players, who also debuted slick new white alternate jerseys for this season. \nCoach and general manager Tim Branham was present also, and he spoke with KSL about the changes he's helped enact to a group looking to better its second-round playoff exit last season. \n\"It's a very different makeup,\" Branham said. \"Last season, we had a real tough, grinding team. This season we have a lot of playmakers, lot of speed, lot of skill. Lot of good young talent. I think the fans will enjoy it.\" \nBranham made several moves over the offseason to craft this sort of group, but he also returns several team veterans who he says he'll lean on throughout the year. Guys like Brent Gwidt, Mathieu Aubin, Corey Fienhage, Connor Hardowa, TJ Snyder and Barry Almeida have all spent time with the franchise before this season. \nAlmeida, in particular, has already looked strong to open the season, posting five goals in the two games against Colorado to leap out to a quick league-wide scoring lead and capture the first of what could be several ECHL Player of the Week awards. \nNow in his third year with the team, Branham knows that the balance between team and individual goals can be a challenge for those with loftier goals. Guys are looking to play well enough to move up to the next level, and it's Branham's responsibility to make sure they pursue those goals within a team concept. \n\"You've just got to let the players know, 'Hey, I'm going to put you in situations where you can be successful. If you're successful and you work hard for the team, we're going to have success as a team, and you're going to have success individually,'\" he said. \"We have a great group of guys. They understand it's a team game out there. The only way to have success is if you do things for the team, but if the team's successful, individually you're going to be successful.\" \n\n\"Coach Branham does an awesome job,\" Gwidt told KSL. \"I think he does a really good job of interacting with his players and getting the best out of them, which is ultimately what a coach should do.\" \nBranham's inclusive style isn't the only thing that impresses players about their experience in Utah. Several noted their comfort within Maverik Center facilities  originally built in part for the 2002 Olympic Games, the stadium and its accompanying luxuries are a big upgrade from virtually any other location in the ECHL. The facilities set a professional tone, and the organization fosters it. \n\"They know how to take care of their players,\" said Gwidt, now entering his fourth season with the Grizzlies. \"Guys, when they play here, they love it. They love the fans, they love the people in the organization. It's just a great organization to be a part of.\" \nSeveral spoke about the fan experience also, not surprising given Utahns' well-known affinity for emphatically cheering on their teams. Utah doesn't seem like a hockey mecca at first glance, but the team has fostered a growing, loyal fan base. \n\"We definitely can't say enough about the support that they give us,\" Branham said. \"The players absolutely love playing in front of them. When you get 9,000 fans on a Monday, the place is rocking and the players are super stoked. It's great to see.\" \nIt all comes to a head Friday night when the Grizzlies open their home schedule against the Allen Americans, reigning ECHL champions. The team will look to continue its hot start and ignite fan interest from the jump in what could be an exciting season. \nThe game begins at 7 p.m. at the Maverik Center in West Valley City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:25:18.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
