He has also won 22 consecutive sets. \nTsonga came into the match leading the tournament with 64 aces, but Djokovic returned so effectively, he broke the Frenchman three times and held him to zero aces in the opening set. \nTsonga played more aggressively in the second set, but still had to fight off five break points until Djokovic was finally able to convert on his sixth when the Frenchman double-faulted while serving at 4-all. Djokovic then served out the match in the next game. \n\"Today, there is nothing to say. He's playing a lot better than everybody,\" Tsonga said. \"You have to be in your best shape to beat him anyway, and everybody knows that it's not easy to play your best tennis every match.\" Read Also: No secret to my success: Novak Djokovic \nDjokovic has traditionally played well during the two-week China swing following the U.S. Open when other players are either nursing injuries or tired after a long season. He captured his sixth title in six appearances at the China Open in Beijing last week and added a third title at the Shanghai Masters. \nHe has a perfect 10-0 record in China finals, including his victory at the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. \nDjokovic has plenty of fan support here, as well, with Serbian-flag waving fans packing the stadium for his matches and, as he related this week, even giving themselves Serbian names and learning the Serbian national anthem. \nDjokovic thanks them for their support by writing a different Chinese character on the courtside television camera after each match and even trying some Mandarin in his victory speech. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:58:08.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
