Both had tough tasks. Heights stayed with eight-seeded Paramus, but was ousted, 2-0, while Wood-Ridge had a very difficult task, falling 6-0, at second-seeded IHA, on Sunday. \nFair Lawn started out slow as Demarest stayed with them for the first half that ended in a scoreless tie. The Cutters had their chances. \n\"I think sticking to our game plan was key to winning the game,\" said Fair Lawn head coach John Van Soest. \"We did a pretty good job controlling play and definitely had our share of opportunities in the first half. We just couldn't find the back of the net.\" \nBut the Lady Cutters finished their chances in the second half as four different Fair Lawn players scored to move the Cutters to the next round. Lisa Kestelboym, Dana Zamir, Eleni Gebbia and Victoria Telewiak scored for Fair Lawn. Telewiak added a pair of assists. \n\"I told the girls keep pushing, keep doing what you are doing and the ball is bound to go in eventually,\" said Van Soest. \"I think once the first one went in our confidence grew a bit and allowed us to put a couple more in before the game was over.\" \nVan Soest said that discipline will be needed if the team wants to pull off the upset of IHA. \n\"We have to stay disciplined on defense. Stay with our runners, don't allow them to give and go us up and down the field,\" said Van Soest. \"Communication will be key as well because I expect them to be switching positions throughout the game.\" \nIn the other games, Heights stayed with Paramus for a half as the Aviators were scoreless at halftime against the Spartans. Heights keeper Emma Nichols kept the Aviators in the game with seven saves. \nBoys Soccer \nThree Community Newsarea teams received bids to the Bergen County Boys Soccer Tournament at the meeting on Monday. \nGarfield garnered a top seed and a bye in the first round. The Boilermakers are the sixth seed and will take on 11th-seeded Pascack Hills on Sunday at Emerson High School. \nFair Lawn has another quality season and garnered a 12th seed. The other area team is Wallington, which received the 16th seed.
