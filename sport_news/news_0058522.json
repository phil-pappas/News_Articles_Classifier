The Tigers will be back at home this Saturday against Spalding University. \nBY ANDY KRUTSINGER \nMt. Pleasant News \nSTORM LAKE — The Iowa Wesleyan soccer teams played at different venues on Wednesday. The women fell, 9-0, at home against Simpson College and the Men dropped their game, 5-0, at Buena Vista University. \nIn the women’s game, a quick Simpson team kept the Tiger defense on their heals all night. The storm outshot the Tigers 44-0, and Caitlin O’Neill was forced to make 17 saves. \nThe Simpson women scored six goals in the first half, but the Tiger defense stepped up in the second, giving up just three. \nIn Storm Lake, the Tiger men had to play from behind all game, after a goal given up in the first 15 seconds of the game. IW kept the Beavers relatively quite, giving up just two more goals until late in the second half, but Buena Vista tacked on two late ones and came away with a five-goal win. \nGoalkeeper Josh Bonilla had to make seven saves in the men’s game, as IW was outshot 32-4. Gabriel Torres led the team with three shots, including one on goal. Mitch Schneider had one shot on goal as well. \nThe women’s team fell to 0-8-1 this season with the loss, while the men’s team dropped to 3-9. Both the men and women will host Spalding University this Saturday. The men will be up first, at 1 p.m., followed by the women, at 3 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:05:18.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
