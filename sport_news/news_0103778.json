Both teams won by twin scores of 4-1 during a wind-swept Thursday on the Tiernan Center courts, setting up Friday's 4:30 p.m. final. \n\"We battled today,\" said Richmond's Logan Mayer, who won in three sets at No. 2 singles for the defending sectional champion. \"I'm just really glad that we're back in the sectional championship.\" \nRichmond halted Centerville, while Hagerstown knocked off Northeastern. \nThe Tigers aim for their first sectional title since 2009, the second of back-to-back championships for the program. \nHagerstown has built momentum under first-year coach Courtney Ecker. The Tigers are now 16-2, and earlier this week won the Tri-Eastern Conference Tournament to force a tie for the overall title with Centerville.

They're doing a nice job,\" Ecker said. \n\"Northeastern has improved so much from the beginning of the season until now. The fact that we can beat them 4-1 tonight is great for my guys because they are a good team top to bottom.\" \nNortheastern's Ryan Wogoman and Michael McDaniel won at No. 2 doubles. \nBrothers Eric Hollingsworth (No. 1 singles) and Ryan Hollingsworth (No. 3) gave Richmond an early 2-0 advantage in its semifinal vs. Centerville. \nTwo of the remaining flights went three sets, but Mayer clinched the victory for the Red Devils by outlasting Nolan Witte 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. \nIt was a reversal of the outcome of last week's meeting between the two in Centerville, when Witte edged Mayer in three sets. \n\"Witte is a really good player. He just gets everything back,\" Mayer said. \"I felt like I played my best tennis today. It was just good to get the win.\" \nCenterville's Nathan Cheek and Josh Duke won at No. 2 doubles, while the Bulldogs and Red Devils battled under the lights in the day's longest match. Richmond's Jacob Weiss and Ross Doughty persevered, winning 6-4, 6-7 (9-11), 6-1 at No. 1 doubles. \n\"I knew this was going to be a tough match. They're a good team,\" RHS coach Randy Hollingsworth said of the Bulldogs. \"We had some chances to put it away sooner than we did, but we'll take it. It's a win. \n\"I'm really proud of the way he (Mayer) played. He lost a couple of tough matches a week or so ago, and he hung tough. I'm really proud of the way he played tonight.\" \nRichmond is now 18-2 overall. Richmond and Hagerstown met in August in an early season match, with the Red Devils prevailing 5-0. \nPlaying consistent will be key for RHS. \n\"We haven't had any lulls really in our play, and as long as we play like we have been I think we'll be fine,\" Randy Hollingsworth said. \n\"They (the Tigers) are playing well. They've got some momentum and we've got to come to play.\" \nEcker praised the Tigers' play across the board. \n\"My doubles teams are playing as a doubles team, and my singles guys have done a really nice job hanging in there,\" she said. \"No matter if they're down or they're up, they're pulling through for me. They're doing a nice job. \n\"Mentally, we have to stay tough. That's pretty much my main focus tomorrow.\" \nJosh Chapin: (765) 973-4463 jchapin@pal-item.com or twitter.com/JoshChapinPI \nTIGERS 4, KNIGHTS 1 \nSINGLES — Tinkle (H) def.
