The officers confirmed it was alcohol, and issued a citation in lieu of custody, McLaughlin said.\nSeveral other people in the alley were being cited at the same time, McLaughlin said, and the officers chose not to write additional citations — such as minor in possession — out of their discretion to save time. The \"party patrol\" had fewer officers available than normal, she said, as earlier in the evening a Lane County Sheriff's deputy had been shot in nearby Cottage Grove.\nA team spokesman said any punishment will remain internal but didn't indicate whether the citation would affect Carrington's expected return to the field next week against Washington State.\nThe citation, which comes with an appearance in Eugene's Municipal Court on Oct. 16, comes nine months after Carrington failed an NCAA-run drug test that forced him to miss the College Football Playoff national championship game against Ohio State, as well as the first five games of this season.\nOregon had appealed the length of the punishment to the NCAA, but did not receive any relief.\nCarrington was not with the team at the time of the citation because of that ineligibility. Oregon (2-2, 0-1 Pac-12) plays Saturday at Colorado (3-1) in what had been expected to be the final game Carrington must sit out.\nHis breakout game of the 2014 season came in the playoff semifinal at the Rose Bowl against Florida State, in which he caught seven passes for 165 yards and two touchdowns.\nHis return to the lineup has become more important this week with a report that the team's leading receiver in 2014, Byron Marshall, could miss the season due to a leg injury.\nHead coach Mark Helfrich classified Marshall's status as \"week-to-week\" on Thursday.\n-- Andrew Greif", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:35:18.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
