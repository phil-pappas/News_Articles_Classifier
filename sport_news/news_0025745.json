Not surprisingly, he missed from out wide. \nNamibia is still yet to win a match at its fifth Rugby World Cup, but earned its first competition point at the tournament earlier in the week in a one-point loss to Georgia. \nArgentina, which reached the semifinals in 2007, will have some concerns over the availability for the quarterfinals of Marcelo Bosch, who was yellow-carded in the 53rd minute for a tip tackle on Namibia flyhalf Theuns Kotze. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:49:16.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
