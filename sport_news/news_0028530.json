He played in each of Tennessee's first six games and had 10 tackles and one fumble recovery. \nTennessee coach Butch Jones announced Tuttle's injury Tuesday and said the freshman \"really had developed into one of our playmakers on defense.\" \nJones also said defensive end/linebacker Curt Maggitt isn't close to returning from a hip injury that has sidelined him for the last four games. Jones said Maggitt is \"still out an extended period of time.\" \nTennessee (3-3, 1-2 SEC) has this week off before playing Oct. 24 at No. 10 Alabama (5-1, 2-1). \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:04:28.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
