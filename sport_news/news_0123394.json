Even when he would get out scoring a 60 or a 70, he wanted to convert it into a hundred. The way he paced from 50 to 60 and then from 100 to 110, this is the bracket when most batsmen get out. Once he crosses that mark, he’ll always play a big innings because that’s his mindset,” said Dhoni at the post-match press conference.\nRotating strike \nDhoni also praised Kohli for rotating the strike and putting pressure on the fielding side.\n\"He was rotating the strike really well. Also, the important thing is when you play such a long innings, the middle \novers — putting pressure on the fielders is the key,\" he said.\n\"If you can freely rotate... that’s one area where we have to improve as a team, especially with the kind of reverse swing the opposition gets. They can cramp us and have a fielder close to the umpire and mid-wicket. If both batsmen can do it, it eases off the pressure,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:33:55.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
