A little more than a minute later, that chance was gone.\nMiami University freshman center Jack Roslovic broke the tie with 1:33 remaining, and the No. 18 RedHawks handed the Buckeyes their third straight loss to an in-state opponent, 3-2 on Friday night at Value City Arena.\nThe RedHawks (1-1-1) took a 2-1 lead a little more than three minutes into the final period and nearly held off the Buckeyes (0-3-0) before OSU senior forward Anthony Greco scored his second goal of the game, this one on passes from David Gust and Craig Dalrymple, to tie it with 2:45 to play.\n“You tie that thing up, you give yourself a chance, and you have a breakdown there and it’s in the back of your net,” Ohio State coach Steve Rohlik said. “So, disappointing, but certainly something we’ve got to build on.”\nOSU’s penalty killing was one of its few bright spots in back-to-back losses to Bowling Green last Friday and Saturday. This Friday, that unit played a starring role once again, not allowing a power-play goal and even adding a short-handed tally by Greco past Miami goalie Ryan McKay 6:54 into the second period. That tied the score at 1.\n“(Miami defenseman Louie Belpedio) just seemed to look back and toe pick or whatever, and I seemed to have a lot of time to put it in,” Greco said.\n“Felt good, but, obviously, the result is not what we wanted.”\nSenior defenseman Chris Joyaux got things started for the RedHawks a little less than 10 minutes in when he found senior right wing Andrew Schmit, who got his shot past Ohio State goalie Matt Tomkins.\nTomkins settled in nicely, making 27 saves, but he was beaten late by central Ohio talent. Freshman right wing Kiefer Sherwood and Roslovic, two Columbus natives, accounted for the RedHawks’ third-period scoring.\n“Overall, I’d like to make a couple more big saves and keep the guys in it,” Tomkins said. “Especially at the end there, I thought that’s a save I can make.\n“Definitely a big save, but one that I’m capable of making.”\nOhio State fell by its smallest margin in three games this season, and it won’t need to wait long for another shot at Miami. The Buckeyes and RedHawks play again tonight in Oxford.\naerickson@dispatch.com \n@AndrewRErickson \nMiami 3, Ohio State 2 Miami 1 0 2 — 3 Ohio State 0 1 1 — 2 FIRST PERIOD  —  Scoring : 1.
