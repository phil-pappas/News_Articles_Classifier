Apparently his wife, famed actress Gabrielle Union, learned that early in the relationship.\nThe \"Bring It On\" star went on the \"Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" on Tuesday, when the topic of her shooting guard hubby came up.

They were firmly bedazzled. You know they called him flash. And on his pockets he had bedazzled flashes. You can watch the full clip of Union's appearance on Fallon below. The basketball talk starts with the ever-talked-about banana boat at around the 1:20 mark of the video.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nMatTKJoDw", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:52:53.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
