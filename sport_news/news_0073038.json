(Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) \nAlabama athletic director Bill Battle was surprised Steve Spurrier resigned from coaching at South Carolina during the middle of this season. \n\"I wish he had done it differently, but he's at peace with what he did and believes he did the right thing and that's all that matters,\" said the 73-year old Battle, who stopped coaching at age 35, about the 70-year old Spurrier at Tuesday's Montgomery Quarterback Club meeting at the Montgomery Country Club. \n\"When you get old as we are, you ought to be able to do what you want to do. His legacy is great no matter however he does it. I wish him nothing but the best. He's been great for the game.\" \nBattle hopes Nick Saban, who will turn 64 Oct. 31, doesn't make a sudden exit \nIn his ninth season at Alabama, Saban has the Crimson Tide (6-1, 3-1 SEC) in position to make a run at College Football Playoff spot for a second straight season. Nick Saban to make $6.9 million as part of new contract \n\"I hope for a long time,\" said a smiling Battle about how much longer Saban could coach. The winner of three national titles (2009, 2011, 2012) at Alabama, Saban is under contract through Jan. 31, 2022 and making $6.9 million a year. \nBattle certainly doesn't want to see Saban leave now as he believes Alabama is starting to form the identity Saban desires. \n\"People don't want to play Alabama now and that's different than it's been the last couple of years,\" Battle said. \"So I really like them. We may lose a bunch more. I don't know, but I like our chances.\" \nThe No. 8-ranked Tide play this weekend against rival Tennessee in a matchup Battle knowns very well. He started three years at Alabama for Bear Bryant from 1960-62 as the Tide won it all in 1961. \nBattle coached seven seasons at Tennessee (1970-76) where he won 59 games. Battle won his first game against Bryant and the Tide in 1970 by a 24-0 score, but lost the last six that included a 20-13 loss in 1976 in Knoxville.. \nBattle has only been Alabama's AD since March 2013, but is clear as to who he's rooting for Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium. \n\"There's great respect on both sides,\" Battle said. \"I'm one of the few that's been in the locker room on both sides. It's a game that should be played. We look forward to it. I was asked that same question when I was at Tennessee and gave the same answer. Heck no, I didn't want to lose to Alabama. You wanted to beat Coach Bryant or you wanted to beat Alabama, but here, we don't want to lose to Tennessee.\" \nBattle does expect the Volunteers to test the Tide, though. Tennessee (3-3, 1-2) are coming off a bye after beating Georgia, 38-31, Oct. 10 in Knoxville. Alabama handled Tennessee, 34-20, last season in Knoxville. \n\"We may face the best quarterback in the (SEC) in Josh Dobbs,\" Battle said. \"He had his coming out party against us last year and did great. He's gotten better ever since. They've recruited well and they've got a good team.\" \nSince losing, 43-37, to Ole Miss last month, Alabama has won four straight games by an average margin of 23.25 points. The Tide are coming off a 41-23 win at then No. 9 Texas A&M last week. \n\"This is a really good team,\" Battle said. \"There's a lot of talent, a lot of young players,. They do a great job of coaching them and getting a lot of people ready to play. We've got a small margin of error because of the Ole Miss game. We did it to ourselves. \n\"It was uncharacteristic and there were two really unusual plays, but our defense is really good. Our offense is good and can be really good. We've got to keep Derrick Henry healthy and get some backup run support.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RUY9pV Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:22:17.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
