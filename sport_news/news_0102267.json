Minute Maid Park has a lot nooks and crannies. It's 315 feet down the left field line, but the wall goes straight backwards about midway from left to center field.  It's 362 feet in the power alley. I asked Rusty what he tells Alex Gordon about playing defense in Houston. Rusty told me Alex will line up with the edge of the Mazda sign. That way if there is a ball hit deep to left center he won't run straight into the corner of the wall that sticks out.  \nCenter field is 436 feet away with e hill and a flag pole in play. I asked what about playing defense in center. He said it's crucial that if a ball is hit there that once Lorenzo Cain feels the warning track he needs to lift his knees higher to account for the hill so he doesn't fall down or injure himself. Rusty also said, \"let's just hope nobody hits it there.\"  \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
