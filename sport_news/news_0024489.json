You're going to have some adversity and we had some adversity right at the start, when they scored on a three-on-one.\n“To answer right back is huge for our team, especially when it's one of our young guys getting his first goal. It lifts everyone up.”\nA pretty goal by Mats Zuccarello, who finished off a tic-tac-toe play with linemates Derick Brassard and Rick Nash, put the Rangers up 1-0 at 6:45 of the first period.\nBut the Jets answer came 46 seconds later when rookie Nikolaj Ehlers blasted a slapper through a screen by Drew Stafford and past goalie Henrik Lundqvist for his first NHL goal.\n“It gave us some energy to come back even harder,” said Ehlers.\nThe Jets played with far more pace than they did against the Islanders, but ran into some penalty trouble during the second period as they were shorthanded on five different occasions.\nHowever, instead of seeing the floodgates open with a string of Rangers' power-play markers, the Jets turned the tables and got a shorthanded goal from Bryan Little to take the lead with 1:11 left in the second period.\n“Sometimes you have a tendency to get off your game and start worrying about the refs. But at the end of the day, you can’t worry about that and you have to find a way to kill them off,” said Jets captain Andrew Ladd. “We did a good job. Our penalty kill stepped up with some big kills and that was a big part in our game.”\nNot only did the Jets find a way to survive the second period, Little's goal gave them a big lift and it was the Rangers that spent too much time in the box in the third when they were trying to respond.\nLittle's second goal of the game provided some insurance and Mark Stuart closed out the scoring with an empty-netter.\n“What we did today here we did last year consistently,” said Jets head coach Paul Maurice, whose club scored twice on the power play. “Every team needs to find its identity and needs to prove to itself that (they) can do it. Even if they've done it all of last year, it's a new year.\n“It's really important mentally, for the psyche of our team, in terms of how we handle adversity.”\nFinding a way to overcome that adversity was an important step, no doubt about it.\nGoing home with a winning record represents a strong start, especially when you consider the circumstances, but several areas need to be cleaned up – which is normal at this stage of the season.\n“Honestly, it's nice to be 3-1 and when you look at it, it's a good road trip but I think we all know that we have better in this dressing room,” said Little. “Some parts of these games, it definitely wasn't pretty for us. There were a lot of times on this road trip that we got away from our game and got into penalty trouble. The feeling going back home is we can still get a lot better.”\nken.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter.com/WiebeSunSports\nWINNIPEG JETS\nNikolaj Ehlers scores first NHL goal, Michael Hutchinson shines as Winnipeg Jets dump Rangers\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 09:33 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 11:34 PM EDT\nNEW YORK – During his first appearance on Broadway, Michael Hutchinson stole the show.\nMaking his second start of the young season, the Winnipeg Jets backup was up for the challenge as he made 40 saves and propelled his team to a 4-1 victory over the New York Rangers on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden.\nThe Jets wrapped up a four-game road trip with a 3-1 record and will face the Calgary Flames in their home opener on Friday night at MTS Centre.\nWith Jets head coach Paul Maurice giving Ondrej Pavelec a rest after he made 40 saves in a 4-2 loss to the New York Islanders, Hutchinson stepped in and was able to shine, improving to 2-0 and looking extremely confident in his first start at MSG.\nBut before the goalie controversy theorists get worked up, Hutchinson's start had more to do with the schedule itself as the Jets faced their second back-to-back situation of the season.\n“(Pavelec) got enough work (Monday) and he was good, really good but we've got an\nAbout the author Ken Wiebe Ken Wiebe's Blog Follow Ken Wiebe on Twitter Other Stories Jets fly out of the gate\nBetter than expected, yet ample room for improvement.\n0\nJets fall flat against Islanders\nBROOKLYN – One team looked like it was desperate after dropping consecutive games to the defending Stanley Cup champions to open the season.
