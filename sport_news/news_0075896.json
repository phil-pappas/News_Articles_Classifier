Bedard Twitter Email Posted: Thu Oct. 15, 2015\nWhen Tom Brady is going this good, he’s almost unstoppable.\nAt the age of 38 and in his 16th season, Brady is on pace to post his best season ever. Four games in, Brady would set career highs for passing yards (5,558, which would break Peyton Manning ’s NFL record of 5,477), completion percentage (72.5), passer rating (121.5) and yards per attempt (8.7). He also hasn’t thrown an interception yet, while he has tossed 11 touchdowns.\nBest of luck to the Colts , New England’s next opponent on Sunday night. In a normal season, they’d merely be the next victim. Considering what transpired in the AFC Championship Game and the Deflategate circus it touched off, Brady could be looking for some payback. Brady, in his usual statesman-speak this week, deflected any added importance for this game.\nNFL Video NFL Power Rankings Week 6: Cardinals and Vikings on the upswing by Chris Burke", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/GregABedard"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:55:50.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
