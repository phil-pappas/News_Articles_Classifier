This was the fifth straight regular season win for CAL over DeSales. Both teams showed off their stout defenses early on when there was no score at the half. CAL put up several big plays in the second half to wrap up their fifth win on the season. \nNeither team was able to accomplish much in the first half. The wheels got in motion for CAL in the second half when they began to generate turnovers. DeSales QB Austin Johnson threw a bad pass across the middle that was picked off by CAL and run back to the DeSales’ nine. The return set up the first red-zone visit for either team. After DeSales stopped CAL on third down, the Centurions elected to go for it at the three yard line. On a reverse, running back Milton Wright hit Clay Davis on a roll-out to give CAL a 7-0 lead in the third. \nFollowing a CAL field goal in the fourth, DeSales had seven minutes to make a run. A long drive led DeSales to their first play from inside the 20. Johnson underthrew his target in the endzone on 1st down and Wright intercepted it and ran it back for a school-record 102 yards. The extra point was no good and CAL led 16-0 late. DeSales would throw another interception on their final drive and CAL wrapped up a 16-0 win over their crosstown rivals. \nThe difference between the two teams was that CAL made plays when they had to. The Centurions only gained 168 yards and ran for 37, but two huge interceptions set up their offense. This was the second consecutive shutout by CAL following their 36-0 win over Meade County last week. \nThere will be more to follow from high school football from across the state as the night progresses.

His unprofessional column earlier in the week was uncalled for seeing as he was rude and disrespectful towards CAL (he’s a DeSales alumni). His previous column was ridiculous and uncalled for.
