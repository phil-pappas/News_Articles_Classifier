It was a kick on the ankle and, despite many attempts to come back, it just didn't feel right. \n\"With further investigation it was discovered that he needed an operation. \n\"He's had it, he's two weeks in. Ten weeks is the estimate (recovery time) but it could be longer than that.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:04:32.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
