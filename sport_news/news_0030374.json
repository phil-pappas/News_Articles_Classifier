Murphy became the first player since Tampa Bay slugger Evan Longoria in 2008 to homer in four consecutive postseason games. \nThe best-of-seven series shifts to Wrigley Field on Tuesday night, with New York ace Jacob deGrom scheduled to pitch against Kyle Hendricks. The wild-card Cubs need a comeback to capture their first pennant in 70 years. \nArrieta gave up hits to his first three batters and was pulled after five innings — matching his shortest start of the year. \nSlumping star David Wright put the Mets in front with a hit-and-run double in the first. Murphy followed with a two-run shot. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:20:59.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
