Enrollment is up one percent over last year. The school board will get a closer look at those numbers Monday night as well as some of the challenges they present when it comes to diversity. They'll also vote on a slight change to the open enrollment policy to help ease crowding at certain schools. \nSioux Falls has 243 more students this year than last year. It's a trend Sioux Falls Superintendent Brian Maher expects to see continue. With that growth comes more diversity, something Maher says needs to be addressed. \n\"The demographics of our certified staff right now is not the same as the demographics of our student population; that will have to evolve as well,\" Maher said. \nMaher says it only makes sense that his staff mirrors the student population, which is two-thirds white and one third non-white. \n\"I think just to have a comfort level and awareness for our kids and maybe role models for our kids to see they can be in positions they can aspire to. I think for those reasons, we'll look to have a more diverse staff allocation going forward and it'll take a while to do that,\" Maher said. \nAnother big challenge for the district is the growing population of kids who don't speak English. \n\"We're not talking about figuring out algebraic concepts here or conjugating verbs; we're talking about learning the language,\" Maher said. \nThe school board is also going to vote on a slight policy change to open enrollment. \n\"Our policy that allows you to pick an elementary school and then use that elementary as a feeder into the middle school is really overloading some of our middle schools,\" Maher said. \nSo it's proposing if parents want to open enroll their kids into a certain elementary school, they'll have to reapply when they start middle school and again in high school, which is a little more strict. \n\"You can open enroll into an elementary, but it doesn't automatically feed you into a middle school,\" Maher said. \nThe school board also will be reviewing the school calendar change to see how the new start date is affecting, students, parents and staff.
