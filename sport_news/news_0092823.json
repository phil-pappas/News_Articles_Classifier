However, Indiana has yet to find a win in the conference, losing their first three contests in Big Ten play. MSU, on the other hand, hasn't lost since Nov. 8, 2014, against Ohio State, and is coming off of an emotional high that is still hard to fully grasp a full week removed from the 27-23 victory over the Michigan Wolverines. \nMSU will be tested in the secondary more than in recent weeks, as the Hoosiers lead the Big Ten in total offense (478.9 yards per game), passing (284.0 yards per game), and third in points (34.1 per game). However, as prolific as their offense is, that is how porous their defense is. Indiana ranks 12th in rushing defense (170.0 yards per game) and 13th in passing defense (334.1 yards per game) which gives one reason to believe that Connor Cook will have a big day. \nGerald Holmes will get the start at running back for Michigan State, as Madre London is not dressed for the contest. Jack Allen and Darian Hicks are not on the dress list as well.
