Department of Natural Resources is limiting access to Dungannon Plantation Heritage Preserve and Wildlife Management Area in Hollywood because of high water levels. File/Tommy Braswell × Last weekend’s historic rainfall has had devastating effects on many South Carolinians. How it has affected, and will affect, fish and wildlife in the state is still being determined. Even in mid-storm, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control issued a closure on the gathering of clams and oysters from the North Carolina border south to St. Helena Sound. The closure remains in effect until sampling results indicate bacterial levels are suitable for harvesting to resume. On Wednesday, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources declared a temporary closure for hunting of all game species except alligator, doves, hogs and coyotes in areas that include five coastal plain drainage systems – the Wateree-Congaree, the Santee, the Waccamaw, the Black River and the Edisto. The closure expires at midnight Oct. 11, but DNR will continue to monitor flooded areas to adjust the closure zones and timeframes as conditions change. DNR has announced it is limiting access to Dungannon Heritage Preserve in Hollywood because “the influx of water has left the spillway/footbridge and dike section of the preserve inaccessible. DNR said the footbridge is not safe to use and a 200-foot section of dike beyond the spillway will need to be repaired. The closed area is marked with flagging and barricaded. Santee Dam Wildlife Management Area in Clarendon County and Wateree River HP Wildlife Management Area in Richland County are closed for all public access. Closed for vehicular access are Botany Bay Plantation Heritage Preserve in Charleston County, Edisto River Wildlife Management Area in Dorchester County and Gunters Island in Little Pee Dee Heritage Preserve, Lewis Ocean Bay Heritage Preserve and Waccamaw River Heritage, all in Horry County. The effects on freshwater and saltwater fisheries are still being assessed with one of the biggest concerns being dissolved oxygen levels. Dr. Steve Arnott with the Inshore Fisheries Section of the Marine Resources Research Institute said that was a big problem after Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Organic materials flushed from the land decays and can cause low dissolved oxygen levels. That especially could be problematic for the oyster population which does not have the mobility of shrimp and finfish species. “Red drum and seatrout are fairly adaptive to varying salinity conditions and also have mobility,” Arnott said. “Red drum are coming to the end of their spawning period. Those red drum that were born in the last month or so that are only an inch or two long, we don’t know about the potential effects on those.” One thing Arnott emphasized was safety on the water. He said boaters should be especially vigilant. Not only will you be dealing with fast-flowing water, but there’s also the potential of encountering submerged logs. Scott Lamprecht, freshwater fisheries biologist for the S.C. Department of Natural Resources at the Dennis Wildlife Center in Bonneau, said the floodwaters will result in muddy conditions on the lakes and rivers and undoubtedly will have a negative impact on the striped bass fishing season which is open Oct. 1-May 31 on the Santee Cooper system. Like Arnott, Lamprecht said a major concern would be fish kills because of low dissolved oxygen levels. “Catfish, at least in some areas, this will provide them with access to feeding areas that hadn’t previously had, particularly in the Congaree and the same thing in the Santee,” Lamprecht said. “This will affect catch rates until the water clears.” Speaking earlier this week, Lamprecht said he had not had any reports of fish kills and is keeping his fingers crossed.
