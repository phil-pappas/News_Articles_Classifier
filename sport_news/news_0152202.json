East Carolina and Cincinnati will travel to BYU in the next two weeks as part of a scheduling arrangement with the AAC ... The Cougars are shooting for the program's 300th home victory ... The game is the longest regular-season trip in the history of the UConn program ... Each team has lost consecutive games after opening with consecutive victories ... BYU is the second independent team UConn plays this season. The Huskies also took on Army ... UConn's defense, while good, has allowed opponents to convert on 46 percent of its third-down chances this year.Scouting reportUConn will win if: The BYU defense is as porous as it has been through the first four games. The Cougars allow more than 400 yards of offense per game, but they've also played a brutal schedule with road games against Nebraska, UCLA and Michigan and a home game against Boise State. They are allowing nearly 27 points per game, or roughly 10 more than the UConn offense averages.BYU will win if: It can figure out its offense. Since the loss of quarterback Taysom Hill in the opener, the Cougars haven't quite decided if they want to do what they did with Hill, a running quarterback, or go more traditional with Tanner Magnum, a drop-back quarterback. After being trounced by Michigan last week, it's a pretty good bet that the Cougars will revert back to what they did with Hill and take their chances.Key matchupsUConn OL vs. BYU DL: The Cougars, in the words of UConn coach Bob Diaco, are giant up front.UConn WRs vs. BYU DBs: BYU's secondary has been rather productive already, coming up with eight interceptions.UConn D vs. third down: The defense has been good, but it has had trouble on third down, particularly last week against Navy.UConn BYU", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:57:19.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
