MAN... By JUSTIN JUOZAPAVICIUSAssociated Press \nSTILLWATER, Okla. (AP) - A woman facing second-degree murder charges after authorities said she plowed a car into the crowd at the Oklahoma State University homecoming parade may suffer from a mental illness and was not drinking alcohol before the crash, her lawyer said on Sunday. \nAdacia Chambers, 25, was arrested after the crash on a driving while under the influence charge, and police said Sunday that she was also being held on four charges of second-degree murder. \nDefense attorney Tony Coleman said Chambers did not smell of alcohol when he met her hours after the crash and did not appear to be someone who had been in a \"drunken stupor.\" Police are awaiting blood tests to determine if she was impaired by drugs or alcohol. \n\"I absolutely can rule out alcohol,\" Coleman told a press conference, adding that he had spoken to her aunt, grandmother and boyfriend and all had said she was not drinking. \n\"She doesn't remember a whole lot about what happened. There was a period where I think ... she could have even blacked out,\" Coleman said. Chambers only recalls people removing her from the car and being extremely confused, he said. \nWitnesses described a scene of chaos as bodies flew into the air from the impact and landed on the road. Three adults and a 2-year-old boy were killed and 47 others hurt, including at least four critically injured. Hospitals initially said five were critically injured but one of those was upgraded to fair condition on Sunday. \nThe dead were identified as Nakita Prabhakar Nakal, 23, an MBA student from India at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, and a married couple, Bonnie Jean Stone and Marvin Lyle Stone, both 65, of Stillwater. Marvin Stone was a retired professor of agricultural engineering, who had been popular with students, a colleague said. \n\"He was loved by students and one of the best teachers we had,\" said Ron Elliott, the former head of the Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering Department at OSU. \"He just really had a gift for connecting with students and helping them learn,\" Elliott said in a telephone interview. \nA man who was standing next to one of the critically injured at the parade said all he remembers is a sound and then Leo Schmitz, his stepfather, was gone. \nMark McNitt said he went to the parade with his wife, mother and stepfather Schmitz. \n\"All I remember is a gush of wind and then the sound, and then Leo, who was standing next to me, wasn't standing next to me,\" said McNitt, whose leg was slightly injured. He was overcome by emotion at times as he spoke to a press conference at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center, where Schmitz was being treated. \nKonda Walker, an OSU graduate who was in Stillwater with her sister to celebrate homecoming, said she was only about 50 feet from the crash scene. \nShe said it took her a few seconds to process what had happened. There were bodies and injured people lying \"all over the place,\" Walker said. \n\"One woman was a crumpled mess on the road. They turned her over and started CPR. We realized she didn't make it,\" she said. \nForty-seven people were injured, including nine children 10-year-old or younger. Five adults were listed as critical on Sunday morning. \nAt the corner of the intersection where the suspect's car came to a stop, a makeshift memorial continued to grow. By Sunday afternoon, there were balloons, flowers, stuffed teddy bears and candles with black and orange ribbons tied around them, for the school's colors. A handmade sign read \"It's always darkest before dawn. Stay strong.\" \nAnthea Lewis had tears in her eyes on Sunday as she placed a child's hat with an Oklahoma State University logo at the base of the memorial. \nOne of the injured had been a baby sitter for Lewis, she said. \n\"I've lived here my whole life and this blows my mind,\" she said. \"This is something that doesn't happen in Stillwater.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Ken Miller in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.
