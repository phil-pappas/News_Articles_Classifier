San Francisco snapped a four game losing streak with a 5-point win over Baltimore.\nPT1M25S 620 349 As it happened: 49ers v Ravens Andrew Johns drops by to watch Hayne Plane LOS ANGELES: Jarryd Hayne says he was devastated by his latest punt return fumble.\nThe Australian rugby league convert caught the ball in the first quarter on Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens and, with the help of his San Francisco 49ers' teammates blocking, beat four defenders.\nBackfield in motion: Running back Jarryd Hayne lines up against the Baltimore Ravens.

I'm sure I'll be asked about that during the week.\"\nThat winning feeling: Jarryd Hayne walks off the field after the San Francisco 49ers beat the Baltimore Ravens at Levi's Stadium. Photo: Ezra Shaw\nHayne has just four days to prepare for the 49ers' next game when they host bitter rivals the Seattle Seahawks, who also have a two-win, four-loss record and are battling to stay in playoff contention.\nThe teams play in the same division, so the loser's playoff hopes will likely be snuffed out.\nThe 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick passing for 340 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, were too strong for the Ravens. It was Hayne's worst NFL performance, with the 49ers electing to give the Australian the back-up running back duties to Carlos Hyde, who was hampered by a foot injury.\nHayne spent plenty of time on the field when Hyde rested, but never touched the ball. His inexperience showed when he failed to block two Baltimore Ravens from sacking Kaepernick. Hayne said he wasn't sure what happened on the play, but would review the tape before the Seahawks game.\n\"We'll have a look at it and nut it down,\" he said.\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:48:10.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
