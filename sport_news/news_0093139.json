Follow David on Twitter at @isportsDave .\nIt was another week of The Connor Cook Show for Michigan State. After defeating arch rival Michigan last week, Cook broke his personal record for passing yards in a game with 398 against Indiana. Cook continues to keep MSU undefeated. At 8-0, with injuries galore, especially on the offensive line, the Spartans continue to find a way. You can give most of the credit to Cook for their record.\nBefore this season, there was debate about who the best MSU quarterback of all-time was, and it was basically a two man debate between Cook and Kirk Cousins. At this point, there should be no debate. Cook is 31-3 as a starter at MSU. That leads all active quarterbacks for games won. He is 3-0 against U-M as a starter, 3-0 in bowl games, including the Rose Bowl and Cotton Bowl.\nCook is a gamer. He comes to play when his team needs him most. In a close win against Rutgers, he threw for 367 yards, his then personal best. Then, against Michigan the next week, he made NFL throw after NFL throw, placing the ball where only his guy could get it, passing for 328 yards in an incredible win. Then, Saturday against Indiana, he breaks his personal record again, this time throwing for 398 yards and four touchdowns. While Cousins was great and deserves a ton of credit for shaping the MSU football program into what it is now, he did not have a stretch of games like this at MSU.\nCook doesn't have a great completion percentage by any means, but part of that is because MSU rarely checks down to running backs. Also, Cook puts the ball usually where only his guy can get it, hence the lack of turnovers this season.\nMSU has had a patchwork offensive line with their injuries, yet, Cook continues to put up monster numbers. Throwing for 300-plus yards in his last three games, and coming up big when he is needed. This season, he is not locking in on one target like he did with Tony Lippett most of last year. Sure, Aaron Burbridge is the clear No. 1 guy, but he spreads the ball around to RJ Shelton and Macgarrett Kings, along with the tight ends much more than he did last year.\nCook can cement his legacy even further if MSU finds a way to beat Ohio State in a few weeks, win the Big Ten title game, and win a national title. But as of now, there shouldn't be a debate on who the best Spartans quarterback of all-time is. Wins and statistics clearly give it to Cook at this point. Cook is set to break Cousins' passing yardage record if he throws for at least 1,000-plus yards in at least five more games, and is three touchdown passes away from passing Cousins' record for the most in school history.\nCook has already cemented himself as the best MSU QB ever. Can he add a national title to that list? He has MSU in position to compete for it.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/isportsDave", "http://isportsweb.com/Spartans/"], "published": "2015-10-26T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:18:04.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
