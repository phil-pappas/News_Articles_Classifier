Look at what the backs can do\nFans and the media have been expecting more from the Sooners running game this season. Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon may have even been underutilized at times this year. That wasn't the case in today's lopsided win. Perine and Mixon tore up the Red Raiders for a total of 405 yards and seven touchdowns on just 57 total carries. The offense sputtered for a bit in the second quarter with a Baker Mayfield interception and a fumble after a completed pass, but the running game stabilized Oklahoma's offense. Perine ended up finishing the game with 201 yards and four touchdowns on 23 carries while Mixon had 154 yards and two touchdowns on just 16 carries. Both averaged at least 8.7 yards a carry.\n2. More on the running game\nHere's how impressive Perine and Mixon were today. At the half, Perine had 132 rushing yards and two touchdowns on just 15 carries (8.8 yards per carry). Mixon was right behind him with two touchdowns of his own on eight carries for 67 yards (8.4 yards per carry). Those stats would have been the second-best game of the entire season for both running backs. And the two only improved from there.\nThe two showed that they're able to carry the load for the Sooners. The passing game this year has been adequate, but nothing outstanding. Mayfield to Sterling Shepard or Durron Neal isn't as electric as Seth Russell to Corey Coleman or Trevone Boykin to Josh Doctson. Those guys have dominant passing attacks. But both Baylor and TCU don't have two backs that can be as dominant as Perine and Mixon were today.\n3. Losing Zack Sanchez hurts\nEven though the Sooners lost Sanchez, the team was able to force four turnovers and limit the Texas Tech offense. But losing the junior hurts. He's one of the best players that Oklahoma has in its secondary. They're going to need him for road games in Waco against Baylor's potent passing attack and against Oklahoma State in the season finale. He was hurt early in the game and appeared on the sideline wearing a boot on his right leg.\n4. Texas Tech got in its own way\nTech had several opportunities to get back into this game, but got in its own way. A touchdown that could have cut the early deficit to 14-7 was negated by an illegal pick from wide receiver Ian Sadler. The Red Raiders instead settled for a field goal. At the end of the first half, quarterback Patrick Mahomes tested Zack Sanchez's replacement (more on him in a moment) and threw an interception in the end zone. Throw in seven penalties for 58 yards and the Red Raiders had their troubles staying out of their own way. It also doesn't help when you give up X.X yards per carry either.\n5. Dakota Austin steps in\nJunior cornerback Dakota Austin had to step in for the injured Sanchez early in the first quarter. The Lancaster native was targeted often and early in this game and he had a few receptions on him. However, he did rebound nicely. He intercepted Mahomes in the end zone towards the end of the second half to take away any momentum that the Red Raiders might have taken into the half.\nBonus: Sooners' linebackers might be the best in the Big 12\nDominique Alexander, Frank Shannon, Eric Striker and Jordan Evans might be the best linebacking corps in the Big 12, or maybe even in the country. Striker routinely got into the backfield in this one to disrupt the quarterback. Everyone but Evans, who didn't play, had an interception and Shannon started his first game since the 2013 Sugar Bowl.\nTwitter: @Josh_Friemel\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510240024&home=24&vis=86", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:35:09.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
