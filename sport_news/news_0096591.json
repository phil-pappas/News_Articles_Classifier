To a query, Chaudhry said the dossiers were submitted to the US because it is an important partner and \"Pakistan's international partners should know about it\". He said the Pakistan government was \"not in a position to reveal the contents of the dossiers\" yet. \"Will do so when a decision in this regard is taken by the government,\" he said. Amid Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's four-day visit to the US, Pakistan's National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz yesterday submitted to the American side three separate dossiers alleging Indian involvement in subversive activities in Karachi, Baluchistan and FATA (federally administered tribal areas). Sharif in his meeting with Kerry yesterday briefed him about the \"destabilising role of Indian agencies in FATA, Balochistan and Karachi\", Chaudhry said. State Department spokesperson John Kirby, however, said he was unaware of the dossiers. \"I'm not aware that we have (the dossiers),\" he responded to a question in a press conference. Pakistan had earlier said that it had handed over the dossiers to the UN. However, the world body has paid no heed to the allegation. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:17:26.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
