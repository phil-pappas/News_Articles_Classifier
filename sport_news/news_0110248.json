Price and Wesko are fifth on 40 penalties, 5.5pen behind Jung on Halunke FBW. Only 8.4 penalties separate the top 10. \nSir Mark Todd is in 14th place on NZB Campino, with a good mark of 43.3, and Jock Paget is 18th on Clifton Signature on 46.9. Although Jonelle Price was 19th on Faerie Dianimo, on 47.7, she has withdrawn before the cross-country. Libby Law \nMichael Jung of Germany holds first place on Halunke FBW, despite riding with a broken ankle \nOf the other New Zealand riders, further down the scoreboard lies Blyth Tait, 28th on Bear Necessity V with 51.3, while Dan Jocelyn, Tim Price on his second ride, and Lucy Jackson are respectively 42nd, 43rd and 46th of the 49-strong field. \nTodd predicts that the water complexes will be influential in tonight's cross-country. \"It's a typically French course with forward distances to skinnies and angles, so there are plenty of places to have a silly run-out,\" he said. \nThere are 29 fences on Pierre Michelet's course and 10 of these are combinations. Three are water complexes, which are notoriously tough at Pau. Libby Law \nJock Paget and Clifton Signature are sitting 18th after dressage \n\"The last water complex could be quite a big effort,\" said Todd. \"There's a big drop in and a bounce out of it. And I think the two corners in the preceding water are big. There's lots of places where riders could be caught out.\" \nPau is one of the very few major events that Jung, the current Olympic champion, has yet to win, but he looks to have two excellent chances with Halunke, on whom he won the European Champs this year, and his Kentucky winning mare fischerRocana. \nAlthough he is having trouble walking, Jung is clearly as effective as ever in the saddle. He is using a segway to get around Pau, in the south of France, with his ankle firmly strapped; he chipped a bone in it when he fell in the water at Burghley.
