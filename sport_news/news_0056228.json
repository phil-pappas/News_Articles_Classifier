Hoffman could be ready in time for Wednesday's visit by the Calgary Flames, when Ottawa wraps up this four-game homestand at the Canadian Tire Centre. \nHoffman is day-to-day with a lower body injury but had indicated Friday he might be able to play Saturday night, which is why the Senators held off calling up winger Max McCormick from the club's AHL affiliate in Binghamton until later in the day when it was determined he wouldn't be ready. \nHoffman wasn't on the ice for Saturday's morning skate before facing the Arizona Coyotes but Cameron said this won't be long-term. \n\"I think it's going to be sooner rather than later,\" said Cameron. \"I went into the room this morning and he was doing his exercises and I asked him how he was and he said he was 'Good.' \n\"I said that's good and I said, 'You know what my theory is on injuries?' which I don't offer very often ... I said I played for an old coach one time who said, 'For every game you miss, you need two bag-skate practices to get back in.' Hoff all of a sudden was dancing around so I think he's close. \n\"I think the odds are good (for Wednesday). He told me he was good and progressing. What that means, I'm not sure.\" \n-- Bruce Garrioch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:38:23.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
