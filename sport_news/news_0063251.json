The rush-hour bombing, which sent a plume of smoke into the sky, wounded at least three civilians including a child, as the Taliban ramp up attacks on government and foreign targets. The intensity of the blast sent an armoured vehicle crashing into a sidewalk, its front end badly mangled, and left the area littered with charred pieces of twisted metal. “The incident took place while a suicide car bomber detonated an explosive-packed car in the Joy Shir area... of Kabul city,” the interior ministry said. “The target of the attacker was the foreign forces convoy.” Security forces cordoned off the area as ambulances with wailing sirens rushed to the scene, but officials said the human toll of the blast was limited. “The ministry of interior condemns in the strongest terms the suicide attack which resulted in the wounding of three civilians,” the ministry said. The police said the wounded included a woman and a child. A NATO spokesman in Kabul confirmed that their convoy came under attack but said the international coalition was still gathering further information. The emboldened insurgents have stepped up attacks around Afghanistan since they launched their annual summer offensive in late April. The Taliban captured the northern city of Kunduz on September 28, their most spectacular victory in 14 years. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:06:52.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
