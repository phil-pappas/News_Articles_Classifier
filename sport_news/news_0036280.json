Soon thereafter he was telling stories. As always, he was smiling and ready to crack wise.\nWhile his form on the golf course the past two years made people wonder why U.S. captain Jay Haas used one of his captain’s picks on Lefty, the five-time major winner’s form in the team room and around his teammates has been spot on, as is has always been the case. Off the course and especially in the team room, he’s an invaluable intangible.\nHe proved his worth on the golf course in Thursday’s first session of Foursomes action, too, as the U.S. took a 4-1 lead.\nUSA TODAY\nU.S. takes 4-1 Presidents Cup lead after dominating opening session\nMickelson, 45, who has played in every Presidents Cup, teamed with Zach Johnson to take down world No. 2 Jason Day and Steven Bowditch, 2 up, in the day’s closest match. Mickelson played well throughout and at times was a highlight reel. His most notable moment came when he holed a bunker shot from 20 yards on the 13th hole when the U.S. was clinging to a 1-up lead. On the 18th, Mickelson’s 327-yard, center-cut drive set up Johnson’s 7-iron to 8 feet. After Day missed his eagle attempt from 18 feet, the hole – and the match – was conceded.\nMickelson, who hasn’t won on the PGA Tour since 2013, is now 21-16-11 in the Presidents Cup.\n“This is the most fun we have all year, and to spend and share time with each other, to play with each other, it's just so enjoyable and I'm so appreciative to be on this team, to be a part of the team and now to be contributing with the points,” said Mickelson, who paired with Johnson for the first time.\n“The thing about Zach and I is we actually can play our best and get other people to play their best with a number of guys on the team now and in the past. For the better of the team, we have played with other partners to bring out the best in them and the best in us, but together, we were also able to play some of our best golf, and I think that we are going to get even better as the week goes on as we spend more time with each other.”\nThey’ll find out Friday in Fourballs. Haas didn’t split up any of his four winning teams from Foursomes and sent out Mickelson and Johnson against Day and Adam Scott.\n“Phil is a different guy, too, and that's the beauty,” Johnson said. “I love his energy. I've always enjoyed just playing with him, regardless of the format, of the tournament, of the situation.\n“Phil can be a pretty energetic guy. The beauty of it is what you see is what you get. His emotions are on his sleeve and that's why he is who he is and what he's done. He's one of our leaders and one of the leaders, best leaders I've been around. … And he’s the best I’ve ever seen around the greens. Put that with how he can drive the ball, it’s scary. And good to be a part of.”\nUSA TODAY\nPresidents Cup changes aim to restore drama to U.S.-dominated matches\nMickelson and his wife, Amy, started the week by giving bracelets featuring black onyx and other gems to his teammates and others involved with the team. Shortly thereafter, he gave a speech to the team. Then started playing ping-pong and giving the needle.\n“Phil is awesome to be around,” Rickie Fowler said. “He's someone I've looked up to. … He's got a little bit of everything. He can be serious when it needs to be done and he can step up and put a speech together, talk to the guys, get you motivated and pumped up. He can also be there to pick guys up, be helpful. I say big brother, but I make reference, he's like a dad to me. He doesn't like that reference because it makes him sound older. He is playing, but it's almost like he's in a captain role in a way.\n“ … And he tries to be funny. Yeah, OK, he’s funny. Phil likes to have a good time. He likes to talk trash and he expects it is back.”\n“He brings it all,” Bubba Watson said when asked what Mickelson brings to the team. “And if it's not that funny, you just laugh because you feel bad for him (laughter).”\nUSA TODAY\nHitting straight a must for Jack Nicklaus-designed Presidents Cup course\nOr as Matt Kuchar put it: “I very much enjoy chatting with Phil … and hearing him. I mean whether it's serious or off the cuff, he's great to be around. He's certainly one of my favorites. The Tour will be at a big loss whenever he shuts it down.”\nMickelson doesn’t want to go down that retirement road just yet. He knows Father Time is catching up and he could be playing on his last U.S. team but remains adamant he isn’t close to looking at the sunset of his career.\n“I'm excited about the way the last few months have gone, which makes me very excited for the coming year and coming years,” Mickelson said. “ … These weeks have become some of the weeks that I cherish the most in my career. These times that we share together and these emotions and the matches and supporting players, developing friendships that last a lifetime and I really cherish my time on these teams.\n“These weeks are very emotional, and they are just the best weeks.”\nPHOTOS: Presidents Cup highlights\nJason Day of the International Team lines up his putt on the 15th green.
