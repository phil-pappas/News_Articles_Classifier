Even the body of a finely-tuned athlete has its limits. And, lord knows, enough adrenaline was pumped during Wednesday night’s fifth-game win in the American League Division Series to last the Blue Jays a lifetime. \nYou can’t really excuse a flat performance in an opener of an American League Championship Series but that’s what it felt like here Friday night, as the Kansas City Royals carved out a workmanlike 5-0 victory over a Toronto team that tried and tried to flip the switch but the engine just wouldn’t fire up. \nMaybe it was too much Edinson Volquez, who gave up a lot of early hard contact that didn’t amount to anything. Or maybe it was just one of ‘those days’. If so, the Jays need to be aware that those kinds of days in the middle of October are even worse for your health than an overdose of adrenaline. \n“They’re dangerous,” said manager John Gibbons. “They put the ball in play and they have such good team speed. \n“Tonight was the Volquez show. He was tremendous. We had a couple of innings where we got some walks and some guys on base but we came up empty. But he was that good tonight. \n“He shut down a good-hitting team, I know that. That’s how good he was. His ball was ducking and darting everywhere.” \nToronto’s offence this night added up to three puny singles and five walks. No Blue Jay baserunner advanced beyond second base as the Jays vaunted lineup went 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position. \nWorse, Edwin Encarnacion reinjured the middle finger on his left hand, the same finger that has been bothering him for at least two months. \n“He’s been battling this thing, I don’t know how long it’s been now,” said Gibbons. “The X-rays are negative but it swelled a little more than we’ve seen in the past but we’ll see. Usually it’s a day or two before it calms down and he’s able to get through it.” \nMarco Estrada pitched decently but was not nearly as effective as he has been down the stretch and into the playoffs. He was tagged for six hits, including four for extra bases, the first three runs ended up on his account. \n“He was pretty good,” said Gibbons. “Overall, he didn’t give up a lot of hits. Early, he was sharp, then he lost it a little bit. He knows how to survive and he kept us in the game. We just got shut out, really.” \nKansas City added two more runs in the bottom of the eighth against reliever LaTroy Hawkins. \nCatcher Sal Perez belted the only home run of the game while Alcides Escobar hit a pair of doubles and scored once. \nVolquez worked six strong innings, allowed just two hits, four walks and struck out six. \nWhile the Blue Jays tried unsuccessfully to break through against Volquez early, the Royals were doing what the Royals do: chipping away, making contact, moving the line. \nThat’s how they broke through for the first two runs of the game against Estrada in the third inning. Alex Gordon led off with a double down he right field line. Estrada rallied to strike out Alex Rios but Alcides Escobar immediately slapped his second double of the game to drive in Gordon to make it 1-0. Another out later, Lorenzo Cain drove a single through the right side of the infield to make it 2-0. \nThrough the first three innings, the Blue Jays had made hard contact against Volquez to no effect. In the top of the fourth, though, staked to a lead, Volquez settled in and, even though he gave up his first hit of the game to Chris Colabello, had his best inning. He struck out Bautista, who didn’t much like home plate ump Tony Randazzo’s strike zone, and then fanned Troy Tulowitzki to end the inning. \nIn the fourth inning, Estrada struck out the first two men he faced, then catcher Sal Perez pounded his third homer of the postseason over the wall in left to make it 3-0. \nIn the sixth, after both Donaldson and Bautista grinded out walks to put runners at first and second with nobody out, Volquez bowed his neck and struck out Encarnacion, got Colabello on a hard-hit fly ball to left and then fanned Tulowitzki. With the exception of Encarnacion every batter in the inning pushed the count full but Volquez didn’t break. \nWith the Royals threatening in the bottom of the sixth, with runners at first and third and one out, manager John Gibbons went to lefty Aaron Loup to face lefthanded hitting third baseman Mike Moustakas. Moustakas hit a slow bouncer to Ryan Goins, cutting across in front of the second base bag. Goins flipped to Tulowitzki, who turned a clutch double play to maintain the score at 3-0. \nIn the eighth, with Hawkins in the game, Eric Hosmer doubled in Escobar and Kendrys Morales launched a sacrifice fly to score Ben Zobrist to put the game on ice. \nThe postseason Blue Jays bullied their way into the ALCS with a stunning deciding-game victory over the Texas Rangers two days previous. No matter the percentages or the likelihood of regression after such a mind-zapping game, to see the October Blue Jays revert to April-through-July form in a game of great magnitude carried an air of unfamiliarity. This used to be the rule, now it is the exception. \nThis is October.
