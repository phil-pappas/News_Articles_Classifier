A couple big plays in the first series for the Tribe was complemented by a big play on defense the second time Olympia had the ball that gave the Indians that early momentum, which was they rode to a 36-12 Corn Belt Conference victory Friday night. Levi Ransom got the ball rolling on the opening kickoff with a return to the PTHS 45. Vaughn Hobart followed with a 20-yard run off the right side on the first play from scrimmage. Seth Cunningham, whose impact was felt on both sides of the ball on this night, threw a bit high to Mikey Carroll on third down, but Carroll made the catch. Thanks to a nice block from Ransom, Carroll turned on the jets for a 36-yard touchdown just 81 seconds into the game. Ransom ran in the two-point conversion after a penalty on Olympia, making it 8-0. Pontiac’s offense went into a bit of a funk over its next three possessions, but the defense was playing bend-but-don’t-break. The “D” was also coming up with some plays. The first was a biggie as Cunningham scooped up a fumble and raced 45 yards for a touchdown. Olympia quarterback Collin Miller ran to the right on a keeper but got the ball knocked away by the Tribe’s Zach Lee. Cunningham picked up the ball and was off to the races. Cam Dawson added the conversion kick for a 15-0 lead with 5:01 to go in the first quarter. The Spartans were driving on their next possession but Cunningham was there to snuff out the threat. Miller rolled out looking for a receiver and lofted a pass. Cunningham picked it off at the PTHS 14 yard line late in the opening period. “We made some adjustments and added some things to our scheme,” Casson said. “It was a bend-but-don’t-break defense and we adjusted well enough.” Olympia was able to control the line of scrimmage well enough to move the ball. The Spartans finished the night with 303 yards on the night, and 139 in the first half. They got on the board with 6:49 left in the second quarter when Miller found Levi Nieson in the end zone. A sign of a good team is being able to bounce back, which is what the Indians did with a score of their own. The big play on the 53-yard drove was Carroll’s juggling grab of a Cunningham pass for a 30-yard gainer. Ransom scored on a 7-yard run off the left side three plays later. Dawson’s kick made it 22-6. Page 2 of 3 - Pontiac’s defense came up with another big play in the final 30 seconds when Colton Bauknecht stayed in coverage and picked off a screen pass, setting the Indians up at the Spartans’ 48. Unlike last week, nothing came out of this late first-half opportunity. Pontiac gave the Spartans a huge opportunity less than three minutes into the third period when Cunningham was intercepted. A penalty added to the issue and Olympia set up shot at the PTHS 15. The Spartans scored when Miller connected with Nieson for an 11-yard score three plays later. Once again, Pontiac showed its mettle by putting together a time-consuming scoring drive that covered 54 yards. Hobart started the 11-play drive with a 19-yard gain. He added a nine-yard run for a first down and an 11-yard pickup off a toss from Cunningham. Hobart crossed the goal line three plays later on a 1-yard jaunt. Dawson was money to make it 29-12 with 3:07 left in the third. The PTHS defense came up big again after Olympia picked up 63 yards on three plays, setting up a scoring chance at the Tribe’s five. Three plays netted a one-yard loss before Miller tried to hit Nieson at the goal line. Carroll stepped in front of the pass and snared it at the end zone. He ran it back 40 yards to not only stop the drive, but to also get the Indians out of a hole. Carroll caught another pass, this time thrown by Cunningham, for Pontiac’s final touchdown. Running a fade route, Carroll caught Cunningham’s pass and outran the defense for a 75-yard score with 7:48 left in the game. Dawson converted his fourth point-after kick. For good measure, Cunningham picked off a Miller pass to foil the Spartans’ next possession and pretty much slam the door on the hosts. “He’s made some exceptional plays,” Casson said of Cunningham. “He’s covering so much ground. He really stepped up.” The win pushes Pontiac’s record to 5-2 on the season and 5-1 in the Corn Belt. The five wins puts the Indians in playoff consideration and secures a winning regular season. Hobart rushed for 128 yards and Cunningham was 11 of 16 throwing for 209 yards and two touchdowns. Carroll had four catches for 148 yards. Ransom, who got banged up, had 47 total yards of offense. PTHS outgained Olympia (1-6) 329-303 and won the turnover battle 5-1 with four interceptions and a fumble recovery. “From ‘D’ line to our linebackers dropping back to their receivers better than I’ve seen all season,” Casson said. “The routes weren’t there right away, so the kind of developed further down so the safeties had time to break on some balls. I attribute that to good coverage.” Page 3 of 3 - Miller threw for 270 yards in leading the Olympia offense.
