The Bahraini is closely allied with Kuwaiti Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, one of the most powerful men in international sports politics, and a key figure in the Olympic movement.Sheikh Salman had initially backed Michel Platini, the UEFA President. But the Frenchman was handed a 90-day provisional ban from football by FIFA's Ethics Committee. Platini could later be let back into the race, if he is successful in overturning the judgement.Also running are Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, South African former Apartheid-era political prisoner turned businessman Tokyo Sexwale, former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid, and former FIFA Deputy Secretary-General Jerome Champagne, with an entry also expected from former Brazil midfielder and coach Zico.
