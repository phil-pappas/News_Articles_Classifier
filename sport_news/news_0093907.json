The grantees include 33 community arts agencies and arts councils such as the Arts Council of Southeast Missouri and the Kirksville Arts Association. The grants fund programs in arts education, arts services, community arts, dance, electronic media, festivals, folk arts, literature, minority arts, multidiscipline, music, theater, and visual arts. The 360 annual grants total $4,215,028.\nThe Council will also award approximately an additional $350,000 throughout the 2016 fiscal year via monthly grants. Monthly grants support smaller scale projects primarily in arts education, community arts, minority arts, and performances by artists in the Council's Missouri Touring Directory.\nDuring the 2015 fiscal year that concluded June 30, the Missouri Arts Council's annual and monthly grants totaled $4.9 million to support programs by 600 organizations in 163 Missouri communities. Missouri nonprofit arts and culture organizations and their audiences annually generate $1.1 billion in economic activity, according to the Arts & Economic Prosperity III study by Americans for the Arts. Nationwide, according to the National Endowment for the Arts, the arts contribute more than $698 million to the economy.\nThe Missouri Arts Council's total FY16 budget of $5.8 million supports the grants, all other programs and services, and the administration of the Council. Sources of funding include an appropriation of $4.8 million from the Governor and legislature, $696,800 from the National Endowment for the Arts, and most of the remaining balance in the Missouri Arts Council Trust Fund.\nThe grants are awarded through volunteer advisory panels of Missouri arts professionals and community representatives. The panelists review the applications to evaluate artistic quality, community involvement, and management ability. The resulting scores are used in a funding formula to determine the grant amounts.\nThe complete list of annual grants is posted in \"Who We Are\" at missouriartscouncil.org < https://www.missouriartscouncil.org/page/11 >.
