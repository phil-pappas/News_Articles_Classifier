The only team it has beaten is last-placed De Graafschap Doetinchem in the first match of the season. \nHeerenveen appointed Foppe de Haan as interim coach. De Haan worked at Heerenveen from 1985-2004, including two long stints as coach. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:02:29.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
