However, the Braves just couldn't get anything going against Stephen Strasburg. \nWeber gave up one run and five hits while striking out a career-high 10 in seven innings on a damp and misty night in Atlanta's 3-0 loss to the Nationals on Thursday night. \n\"That was pretty darn impressive,\" Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said. \"Especially coming after his last start where he didn't even get out of the second inning. He throws the ball over, he gets ground balls, he fields his position, so you feel comfortable.\" \nWeber (0-3), a September call-up from Triple-A Gwinnet, gave up seven runs in two innings in his last start. He bounced back Thursday and ended his season on a positive note. \n\"Being able to finish strong like that has given me something to look forward to when I head into spring,\" Weber said. \"Given the chance to start and show what I can do, it made me feel good to know I can compete at this level.\" \nStrasburg scattered six hits and struck out seven in six innings to help the Nationals salvage the finale of the three-game series. \nThe Braves had limited the Nationals to one run in the first two games of the series. \nRookie Clint Robinson hit a solo home run off Weber in the second inning, and Washington added two unearned runs in the eighth inning. \nThe key play in the eighth was an error by third baseman Adonis Garcia, whose throw on a potential inning-ending double-play sailed into right field and allowed Difo Wilmer to score. Bryce Harper then grounded into a fielder's choice to drive in Yunel Escobar. \n\"We took advantage of a miscue and Harp with the hustle to first,\" Nationals manager Matt Williams said. \"These guys are continuing to play.\" \nThe Braves' biggest threat against Strasburg came in the sixth inning when they had two runners on with one out. The right-hander struck out Nick Swisher and Jace Peterson to end the threat. The Braves left 14 runners on base. \nMichael Bourn went 1 for 4 to extend his hitting streak to 10 games. Garcia and Cameron Maybin had two hits each. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nNationals: 3B Escobar was held out of the starting lineup with back spasms. He participated in batting practice and pinch hit in the seventh inning. He drew a walk and scored. \nBraves: C Christian Bethancourt left the game with an apparent left hand injury after striking out in the fifth inning. ... 3B Hector Olivera sat out with a sore left elbow that was hit by a pitch on Tuesday. Olivera played Wednesday, but the swelling returned. He is day-to-day. \nUP NEXT \nNationals: Gio Gonzalez (11-8, 3.93) will get the start as the Nationals open its final series of the year at the New York Mets. Gonzalez is 1-0 with a 0.77 ERA in two starts against the Mets this season. He will be opposed by Noah Syndergaard (9-7, 3.34). \nBraves: The Braves will host the NL Central champion St. Louis Cardinals for three games to close the season. Julio Teheran (10-8, 4.16) has a chance to hit the 200-inning mark for the second straight season. He has 194 2/3 in 32 starts. He will be opposed by Jamie Garcia (10-5, 2.36). \nPOWER OUTAGE IN THE ATL \nThe Braves starting lineup, which featured three rookies, had a combined 36 home runs entering the game. Harper has 41. \nON SECOND THOUGHT \nThe Braves successfully challenged a pickoff attempt at first base in the fifth inning. Michael Taylor was ruled out after a review of 1 minute, 11 seconds. The Braves are 23 for 44 on challenges for the season (52.3 percent), which is slightly above the league average of 49.6 percent. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:19:09.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
