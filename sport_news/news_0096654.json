But it wasn't to be for Jung, when he was forced to withdraw his leading horse, Halunke FBW, from the holding box at the final horse inspection. Consequently, he still led on FischerRocana FST, but the mare kicked out a show jump, dropping them to second behind young Frenchman Astier Nicolas riding Piaf De B'Neville. \nThe victory was met with a roaring seal of approval from the full grandstand; a home rider has not taken this title since Nicolas Touzaint in 2007. To make it even more special, Astier Nicolas is from the city of Pau, although he is a familiar face on the British circuit, having been based in Gloucestershire for several years. Libby Law \nAstier Nicolas of France was thrilled to win his first four-star event on home ground \n\"I wasn't at all nervous because I had two riders in front of me and didn't think I would win,\" said Nicolas. \"It's very special to win my first CCI4* in France. It is a moment I have waited for a long time.\" \nAt 26, Nicolas is the youngest CCI4* winner this year; his previous best result was sixth at Pau in 2012. \nIt was a tough day over the coloured poles overall for the riders, with only seven clear rounds from the 33 starters. One of the best of these was as immaculate round from Price on the wonderfully reliable Wesko, which moved them from fifth spot overnight to third. Libby Law \nGreat Britain's Emily King was fourth on Brookleigh \n\"It's great for Wesko to keep coming out and remaining consistent, especially the year before an Olympics,\" said Tim. \nBritish teenager Emily King had one down on Brookleigh to finish fourth at her first four-star, and France's Karim Florent Laghouag was clear on both his horses to rise to fifth and seventh places respectively. \nThe other New Zealand riders were not able to emulate Price; Sir Mark Todd and NZB Campino had an uncharacteristic two rails down to add eight faults to their score, but finished in 10th place. Libby Law \nBlyth Tait and Bear Necessity V; the horse stepped up to complete his first four-star \nJock Paget and Blyth Tait each had three down, adding 12 penalties apiece, finishing 14th and 15th on Clifton Signature and Bear Necessity V. Lucy Jackson withdrew her horse Bosun before the show jumping, the horse suffering from a minor foot injury. Ad Feedback \nThere was major disappointment from several other riders. Tim Lips from the Netherlands had 12 faults to drop from sixth to 11th, Australian Paul Tapner and Indian Mill knocked down six fences, to drop 10 places to 17th, and Germany's Andreas Dibowski hit four with FRH Butts Avedon, slipping to 12th. \nThe next event in the FEI Classics series is the only four-star in the southern hemisphere, the Adelaide International three-day event which runs from November 19-22. \nFor more like this, see NZ Horse & Pony magazine, new issue out now \nResults, final 10: Astier Nicolas (FRA), Piaf De B'Neville, 38.5, 1; Michael Jung (GER), FischerRocana FST, 39.4, 2; Tim Price (NZL), Wesko, 40, 3; Emily King (GBR), Brookleigh, 42.3, 4; Karim Florent Laghoug (FRA), Entebbe De Hus, 42.6, 5; Claas Romeike (GER), Cato 60, 47.3, 66; Karim Florent Laghoug (FRA), Punch De L'Esques, 49.3, 7; Sarah Bullimore (GBR), Valentino V, 49.8, 8; Claire Abbott (IRE), Euro Prince, 50.7, 9; Sir Mark Todd (NZL), NZB Campino, 51.3, 10. - NZ Horse & Pony", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:09:25.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
