Now he’s running through the holes instead of creating them. \n“It was different at first, but I’m getting used to it,” he said. “The biggest thing is holding onto the ball. Those guys up front give me huge holes to run through.” \nMaquoketa Valley (4-2 overall, 4-0 district) took sole possession of the A-5 lead and won its 21st straight district game, dating back to 2012. \n“We’ve been playing really well,” said Wildcats Coach Wes Wilson. “We’ve been able to run the ball, and when you control the line of scrimmage, it makes things a lot easier. \n“We pride ourselves as having a big, physical, tough line.” \nMcDowell ran for three touchdowns. Quarterback Jeremy Fischer added 159 yards on 20 carries, running for four touchdowns and passing for another. \nAll told, the Wildcats netted 453 yards, 396 on the ground. \nMaquoketa Valley had a comfortable 35-12 lead by halftime, then invoked the continuous clock in the third quarter. \nWhile the Wildcats were running at will, North-Linn (3-3, 3-1) was pass-happy. Logan Novak completed 15 of 18 passes for 204 yards, throwing for two touchdowns (to Brandon Stepanek and Ben Wolff) and running for another. But the Lynx fumbled it away three times. \nWolff caught six passes for 158 yards. \nMaquoketa Valley hosts Starmont next week.
