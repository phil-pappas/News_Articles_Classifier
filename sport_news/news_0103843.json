Having found the right formula, they’re right back in it this year. \nLorenzo Cain scored from first base on Eric Hosmer’s single to deep right field in the eighth inning, and the Royals beat the Toronto Blue Jays 4-3 on Friday to claim the American League Championship Series in six games. \nCain motored to third on Hosmer’s line single off rookie closer Roberto Osuna and was waved home by third-base coach Mike Jirschele when right fielder Jose Bautista’s throw went to shortstop Troy Tulowitzki at second. Cain slid into the plate easily ahead of Tulowitzki’s throw for the game-winning run. Royals eliminate Blue Jays in Game 6 of ALCS to return to World Series \nRoyals closer Wade Davis, who had to sit through an hourlong rain delay, survived a second-and-third, no-out situation, retiring Josh Donaldson to end it. \nBautista’s second homer of the game and fourth of the playoffs, a two-run shot to left off Ryan Madson, tied the game 3-3 in the eighth and breathed new life into the Blue Jays when they were five outs away from getting vanquished. They had won four elimination games before Friday. \nMadson had taken over for Kelvin Herrera to open the eighth with a 3-1 lead, but gave up an infield single to leadoff hitter Ben Revere. Bautista followed one batter later with a line shot over the left-field fence that stunned a capacity crowd of 40,494 ready to celebrate the Kansas City’s back-to-back trips to the World Series. Blue Jays' Ben Revere makes awesome leaping catch in Game 6 \nA 45-minute rain delay in the middle of the eighth might have helped the Royals shake off the shock of seeing their vaunted bullpen blow a late lead, and when Cain led off the eighth by drawing a walk off Osuna, the party atmosphere returned. \nOne inning later it was on full-blast, as Wade Davis closed out the Royals’ fifth consecutive home win in these playoffs. \nEarly home runs by Ben Zobrist and Mike Moustakas off David Price had staked Kansas City to a 2-0 lead, which Bautista cut in half with a solo homer off Yordano Ventura in the fourth. \nAlex Rios, who entered the postseason with the most games played (1,691) among active players without a playoff appearance, drove in an insurance run with a single in the seventh to increase Kansas City’s lead to 3-1. \nThe Royals had come close to scoring earlier in the innings when, with a runner on first, Salvador Perez cracked a deep drive to left that had all the makings of an extra-base hit. But left fielder Ben Revere raced back and made a sensational leaping catch, smashing his face against the fence, to keep Toronto within a run. Two batters later, Rios extended the margin to two runs with his RBI single. \nPrice failed in his attempt to finally pick up a postseason victory as a starter, but at least he did not take a second loss in the series, as Bautista’s second homer got him off the hook. The Blue Jays ace actually pitched well after a rough start, giving up five hits and three runs and striking out eight in 6 2/3 innings. \nIn Game 2, Price retired 18 consecutive batters after a leadoff single by Alcides Escobar, then ran into trouble in the seventh. The Royals knocked him out with four singles and a double in a span of seven batters. \nThis time they initially resorted to the longball, a surprisingly effective weapon for them in the playoffs. After finishing next-to-last in the league with 139 homers during the regular season, Kansas City has pounded out a club-record 15 in 11 postseason games. \nFormer Tampa Bay Rays teammate Zobrist pounced on a Price cutter and pulled it over the fence in left to put the Royals ahead 1-0 in the first, and in the next inning Moustakas took advantage of a changeup – usually a no-no from a lefty pitcher to a lefty batter – and yanked it 398 feet to right-center. Royals' Mike Moustakas hits questionable home run in Game 6 \nThe Blue Jays contested that a fan had interfered with the ball and it might have stayed in play otherwise, but the homer and the 2-0 lead stood after a video review. \nThat was the fifth hard-hit ball Price yielded to the first six batters he faced, and it looked like another stain would be added to his tarnished playoff resume. The 2012 AL Cy Young Award winner came in with a career 2-7 record and a 5.24 ERA in the postseason, the two wins coming in relief. \nBut then Price found a groove and silenced the Royals offense until Rios’ single off reliever Aaron Sanchez. After Moustakas’ home run, Price retired 14 of the next 17 batters he faced, eight of them via strikeout. \nVentura kept the Blue Jays’ potent offense at bay as well. The 24-year-old Dominican gave up a leadoff double to the game’s first batter, Revere, then got the next 10 batters out in a row, mixing a darting changeup and wicked curveball with his 96 mph fastball. \nIt wasn’t until Bautista crushed one such fastball well over the fence in left in the fourth inning that the Jays broke Ventura’s spell. Ventura, who was briefly demoted to the minors when he struggled to a 4.73 ERA in the first half of the season, was making his eighth postseason appearance, becoming the fourth pitcher to reach that mark before his 25th birthday. \nThe poised gained through that experience showed in the fifth as the Royals held on to a 2-1 lead. After walking the first two batters in the fifth, Ventura kept them at first and second by getting two harmless flyouts, then a liner in which third baseman Moustakas made an excellent catch to deny Josh Donaldson. \nThe Royals turned to their bullpen when Ventura gave up a one-out double to Edwin Encarnacion in the sixth, with Escobar preserving the lead through the seventh. Madson, though, couldn’t hold it. \nGALLERY: BLUE JAYS, ROYALS CLASH IN THE ALCS Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
