Paul Zoeller/Staff × Brett Cameron spent just three games with the South Carolina Stingrays a year ago before getting called up to the American Hockey League. If Cameron continues to play like he did in the Stingrays’ season opener Saturday night, it won’t be long before the AHL comes calling again. Cameron scored two goals and goalie Mark Dekanich stopped 28 shots to lead the Stingrays past the Reading Royals, 2-1, before an opening-night crowd 4,739 at the North Charleston Coliseum. It was an emotional night and start to the season as survivors of the Mother Emanuel AME Church shooting dropped the ceremonial first puck and received a rousing ovation from the crowd. The Stingrays wore special “Charleston Strong” jerseys, which will be auctioned off through Nov. 10. Proceeds from the auction will go to the children of the victims. “It was a special night for the organization,” said Stingrays coach Spencer Carbery. “I’m glad we were able to do our part in helping the victims of that tragedy.” On the ice, the Stingrays turned in a solid performance despite having just four returning players from last year’s Kelly Cup finals team. “I thought there were a lot of positives,” Carbery said. “We were better than I thought we’d be structurally. We were sound defensively. We took really good angles and played pretty well inside our defensive zone.” When Cameron finished his senior season at the University of Alaska-Anchorage, he played in just three games with the Stingrays, scoring three goals and adding an assist. Adirondack called up Cameron to the AHL for five games, and as a result, he was not on the Stingrays’ playoff roster. “I would have loved to have been a part of that playoff run, but it was a great learning experience either way,” Cameron said. “I’m happy I’m back here now. It’s such an easy team to play for. The guys I’m playing with are great. This system fits my game perfectly. I’m big, I’ve got pretty good speed and I don’t mind going to the net.” Cameron is just picking up where he left off last season, Carbery said. “Brett is going to be a big part of this group,” Carbery said. “He’s a very versatile player. He’s big, he’s strong, he can get up and down his wing and he’s not afraid to go to those areas where you have to go to score. Brett’s going to get some attention from the next level. It’s only a matter of time.” Dekaninch was equally impressive, stopping all but one of the shots he faced. “Mark was in a zone tonight, really played well and made some big saves in the second period that kind of stuffed some momentum for them,” Carbery said. “He was on his game and that’s huge early in the season for him and for us to get off to a good start.” Cameron gave the Stingrays a 1-0 lead midway through the opening period when he redirected a shot from the blue line from defenseman Marcus Perrier.
