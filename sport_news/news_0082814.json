They think an 8-30 record is enough to warrant making a change, some as soon as Monday when the team returns from the Buffalo Bills game in London to start a bye week. \nIn the Jaguars locker room, Bradley’s players dismiss that idea as crazy, saying it’d only make things worse by changing course midway through a season in which a 1-5 team is only a few plays away from being 3-3 or 4-2. \nDefensive tackle Sen’Derrick Marks was incredulous about firing Bradley at midseason, saying: “Why? What [benefit] you going to get?” \n“Progress is based on wins in fans’ eyes,” added tailback Toby Gerhart. “I think it’s just a matter of time before we break through. From where this team was a couple years ago to now, we’re one possession away [in many games]. The next step is to learn how to win games at the end.” \nBut a large segment of fans — some who undoubtedly exited EverBank Field Sunday during the fourth quarter of a 31-20 loss to the Houston Texans — have Gus fatigue. They want to see evidence of a turnaround beyond a coach promising to learn from another defeat, and it’s a valid point. \nWhile the offense has improved (quarterback Blake Bortles’ 13-7 ratio of touchdowns to interceptions is respectable), there’s legitimate concern about Bradley’s game-management acumen and a defense that shows little sign of stopping anybody. \nPlayers fiercely loyal to Bradley think their coach can ride out this storm and rescue a boat now taking on a lot of water. That begs this question: What is a salvageable season? \nI’m not ready to call an audible from my two previous stances on Bradley. The first is that a 6-10 record should be the minimum standard for Khan to retain Bradley in 2016. Secondly, it’d be unfair to Bradley to dismiss him before this season expires because the extent of the Jaguars’ rebuilding situation given him was beyond the normal NFL fixer-upper. \nCould my stance change if this team regresses in the next month or a Joe Philbin-type mutiny infiltrates the locker room? Certainly, almost everyone’s job security in this league is a fluid situation. \nBut let’s be clear about one thing: Bradley is, and should be, feeling a lot of fan heat. As I wrote in the offseason, no NFL coach with his record (7-25) or worse after two years has ever made it to a fourth year and most don’t even get a third season. \nSo give Khan credit for sticking by his coach this long without micromanaging. He’s giving him a fair shot to rectify a messy situation. \nThe Jaguars would have to go 5-5 the rest of the season just to get to 6-10, which would double last year’s win total. That’s now a tough hurdle, considering the Jaguars’ suspect defense must still face six top-10 offenses. But that’s the predicament they deserve for giving away games, especially to Indianapolis and Tampa Bay. \nIf Bradley won’t get more involved with play-calling on defense — which is last in the NFL in third-down efficiency (50 percent), takeaways (3), and has one interception in 219 pass attempts — then he better get more creative in finding ways to keep opponents with so-so quarterbacks from carving his team up. \nEvery coaching era has an expiration date. Remember, Tom Coughlin, who took the Jaguars to two AFC title games, essentially got fired in 2002 because fans couldn’t stomach three consecutive losing seasons (none worse than 6-10). \nBradley says he’s too busy trying to ignite a turnaround to think about the fan discontent. \n“I always want to make sure that we play hard in front of our fans and we give them a good product,” said Bradley. “I didn’t recognize that they left [the Texans game early], but now I imagine there’s probably quite a few if you’re bringing it up to me, but our whole focus is this team. \n“What goes on in that locker room and how we handle it in the team meeting and how we talk, there’s not a lot of conversations about, ‘Here’s what they’re saying outside.’ We don’t talk like that. They will be happy if we get this right, so we put all of our attention into that.” \nBradley better get things right pretty quick. Shad Khan can only hold out so long on him finding a winning formula.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:44:37.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
