They knew that in order to produce more \"Mangum Magic,\" as Mangum's late-game heroics have been named this season, they needed to step up and be able to protect their wounded magician. \n\"We all looked at each other and said, 'he is not going to be able to scramble like he normally does,'\" offensive lineman Ryker Mathews said. \"We have to give him a perfect pocket, so he doesn't have to move around on that leg, and I think we did all right.\" \nThey didn't just do all right, they did an excellent job protecting the gimpy Mangum on a 10-play, 75-yard, game-winning touchdown drive. Mangum was not sacked on the drive and had enough time to complete three of his four attempts while drawing a key pass interference call on ECU's defense. \n\"You could definitely tell he was in a lot of pain, but he is a trooper. He came out for the team. It tells you a lot about his character and who he is as a player,\" Mathews said. \"He stood in front of the line and said 'let's go guys, let's do what we have to do,' and we told him that we had his back.\" \nThe offensive line also had Algernon's Browns back Saturday, paving the way to his 134 rushing yards and three touchdowns. He also caught a 22-yard touchdown from Mangum. Mathews said the offensive line was pleased with the breakout type of game that the gritty, hard-hitting Brown had.

Allred/Deseret News) \n\"It's awesome, especially a guy like Algie. He fights. He will do anything he can for that extra blade of grass,\" Mathews said. \"You come to the sidelines and he comes and gives us props. It helps us a lot getting a little gratitude from him. It makes us want to block harder for him. There are not a lot of people in college football that can do it like he does.\" \nA more balanced offense between the run and pass game is it what BYU has been trying to play like all season. Starting two weeks ago against UConn, BYU has recorded back-to-back games of 150 or more rush yards and 300 or more passing yards for the first time since 2013, and just the third time in Bronco Mendenhall era. When a Mendenhall coached team reaches this 150+ rushing and 300+ passing feat they are 18-2. \nEstablishing a strong run game to balance the attack and keep pressure off of Mangum is going to be one of the main focuses as BYU approaches the second half of the season, especially with Mangum nursing his hamstring. Mangum is probable for Friday's 6 p.m. home game with Cincinnati. \n\"We want to be effective all game running the ball. We want to take some pressure off of Tanner,\" Mathews said. \"We are striving to improve our run game and have successful run plays every time.\" \nA key is also the health of the offensive line. Last week, offensive lineman Ului Lapuaho went down with a leg injury and did not return to the game. He is probable this week. \n\"I think we are trying to get to the point to play the same five every down,\" Mathews said. \"If our tempo is faster then we might rotate a little more. It is tough for 300-pound dudes to go that fast sometimes.\" \nA balanced attack might turn into an air frenzy this weekend as the Cincinnati Bearcats post one of the top passing threats in the nation. Cincinnati ranks fifth nationally in total offense at 587.2 yard per game and fifth in passing offense at 385.8 yards per game compared with BYU's total offense 408.2 (63rd) and total passing of 282.2 (27th). The Cougars will need to find a way to slow the Bearcats down while still putting up a lot of points. \n\"They are very skilled….very explosive. I would compare them to the Memphis team we played last bowl game,\" Mendenhall said. \"It will be a great college football game and a really good test.\" \nListen to audio from Monday's postpractice media availability from Mendenhall, Mathews and Travis Tuiloma in the \"Cougar Cuts\" section below.
