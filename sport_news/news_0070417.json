Shabel Stadium. \nWith the loss, Good Hope dropped to 2-4 (1-3 Class 4A, Region 7), while Locust Fork improved to 3-3 (2-2) on the season. \nCoach Alan Scott didn’t take too long to diagnose what exactly went wrong for his team following the tilt. \n“We didn’t play well tonight, and they played excellent,” he lamented. “Give them credit, though. They came out and hit us in the mouth from the word, ‘Go.’ I’ve just got to do a better job of getting our guys ready.” \nThe Hornets found the end zone on their opening possession on a fine 31-yard scamper by quarterback Chase Rice. \nThey padded the cushion to 19-0 by halftime on a 37-yard scoring toss from Michael Reid to Dylan Hurst and a 5-yard jaunt by Chase Biles in a dominant second quarter that saw the visitors outgain the home team on the stat sheet 148-23 in total yardage. \nMeanwhile, the Raiders had the ball inside Locust Fork territory on four separate occasions in the first half — only to come away with nothing to show for it. \nGood Hope trailed 25-0 early in the fourth quarter before cashing in a nice drive with a 12-yard touchdown run by senior Jonathan Burnette. \nAlthough Locust Fork scored only four plays later, Scott’s squad came right back with a sublime 42-yard aerial strike from Riley Eisner to Matt Cofer — followed by a 2-point conversion rumble by Lee Whisenant — which cut the deficit to just two scores with more than 4 minutes left. \nUnfortunately, Locust Fork recovered the ensuing onside kick and was able to milk the clock dry with a few first downs for the victory. \n“Coming out of halftime, we wanted to dig in and get what we could,” Scott said. “We just couldn’t get anything going until late, but our guys played hard until the end. I appreciated that effort.” \nEisner finished 6 of 12 through the air for 90 yards and a touchdown. The junior also hauled in an interception on defense. \nMatthew Dixon, Whisenant and Burnette combined for 82 rushing yards on 19 carries, Matt Hancock tossed in three receptions for 30 yards and Dakota Burney had his nose in several tackles defensively. \nRice ended his game with 150 total yards and two scores, while Biles and sophomore tailback Drew Rogers combined for most of the ground damage for the Hornets. \nThey’ll host DAR next week in what could prove to be a pivotal tilt with postseason implications. \nFor Good Hope, the chance for a playoff bid is still on the table. \nIt’ll just have to traverse an extremely difficult three-bout stretch that includes 4A No. 6 Priceville, DAR and North Jackson. \nThink Scott and his kids are done fighting? \nNot a chance. \n“Absolutely not,” he said. “We’re going to try to win every game that we play.” \n% Jake Winfrey can be reached at 256-734-2131, ext. 136 or at jwinfrey@cullmantimes.com.​  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:37:19.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
