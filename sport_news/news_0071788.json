As Edelman crossed the goal line, Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson and safety Mike Adams sandwiched the Patriots slot receiver, whose 12-yard catch tied the game at 7-7.\nI don't think it's supposed to bend that way, Julian. pic.twitter.com/HeW4XSuYgO\n— Toucher and Rich (@Toucherandrich) October 19, 2015 After Edelman’s touchdown, the Colts had a 3-and-out. Edelman returned the ensuing punt and caught a pass on the Patriots’ first play of the following drive.\nBased on a tweet from a Patriots beat reporter, Edelman’s finger injury may have occurred previously.\nEdelman's finger has been kinda funky for a long time. Not an injury from tonight. https://t.co/6EB1Yq4e7h\n— Jeff Howe (@jeffphowe) October 19, 2015 Or maybe he made it worse?
