They challenged us to a basketball shootout while wearing instruments. We had to shoot wearing a 40-pound sousaphone, a marching snare, a 16-inch bass drum and a 20-inch base drum. \nWearing a cumbersome instrument made it tough, but watch the challenge and see who made sweet music in this challenge. \nIf you have a challenge for me, email me at ibeatpete@kcbd.com \nCopyright 2015 KCBD .
