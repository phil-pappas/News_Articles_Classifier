What's important to me right now is getting my body fit and ready for my forties so next time I do play on tour I will be 40.\" STORY: Golf's former world number one, Tiger Woods, was in Mexico on Tuesday (October 20) to promote the sport and lead a clinic for golf enthusiasts in the capital, calling for the region's youth to get behind the sport. Woods is in the city to promote the America's Golf Cup to be held from which starts on October 22. In soccer-obsessed Latin America golf has traditionally taken a back step in popular sports. But in the last decade golf talent has emerged from the region. Argentina's Angel Cabrera won the U.S. Open in 2007 and the Masters two years later and Mexico's Lorena Ochoa, who retired in 2010, held the world number one position in women's golf for 157 weeks. Wood's called for more accessibility to golf in Mexico and across Latin America to inject some new blood into the sport. \"Well I think that it's obviously this country and many Latin American countries, football is the dominant sport and I think a lot of that is not only for tradition but accessibility. We need to make golf affordable and accessible and a lot of times it's not. Kids aren't being introduced into the game of golf at early ages as they are to football and any other sports and so consequently we don't have as many players coming out of these regions,\" he said. Thirty-nine-year-old Woods has won 14 majors but is currently inactive due to back surgery. But on the cusp of turning 40 Wood's outlined his priorities for a post-injury golfing comeback. \"Over 20 years I think I've compiled a pretty good record and my record's not done yet. What's important to me right now is getting my body fit and ready for my forties so next time I do play on tour I will be 40,\" he added. After the news conference Woods headed to Mexico City's iconic Chapultepec Park where he helped children with their golf swing. Woods, who holds the record of 683 weeks as number one in the world, hopes to return to competition at the beginning of 2016.
