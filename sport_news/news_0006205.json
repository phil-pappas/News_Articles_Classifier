The Billikens won their 10 titles during the ‘60s and ‘70s, but the Hoosiers had more success in recent years, having won their eighth title in 2012.\nThe Hoosiers and the Billikens have met 34 times during the programs’ histories. In those matchups, IU leads 21-9-4. IU defeated St. Louis, 3-1, when the teams met at Bill Armstrong Stadium last year.\nSophomore Grant Lillard played in the 2014-15 victory against the Billikens and said he anticipates an exciting match as the Hoosiers prepare to travel to Hermann Stadium.\n“We know there’s a lot of history that goes into this game,” Lillard said. “Last year was my first year (against them), and it was a competitive game the whole entire time. I’ve never been to St. Louis, but I’ve heard that they’ve a nice setup over there, so it’ll be exciting.”\nLillard also said that the team is feeling more confident as they head into this fixture on the backs of consecutive victories. A win would also mean the Hoosiers would have won three consecutive games for the first time in the regular season this year.\n“As you start winning games, (winning runs) is in the back of your mind a little bit,” Lillard said. “But we are just trying to take it game by game, half by half, and putting together a full 90 minutes and focusing on what’s at us right now.”\nFreshman defender Andrew Gutman, who scored his first goal for IU on Sunday, echoed the same thoughts and said right now the team is focused on putting in a good shift.\n“All I know is that we got to focus on us and get better everyday and hopefully get the win,” Gutman said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:10:52.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
