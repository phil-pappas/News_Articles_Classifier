Ritter had 12 kills to go with two aces, seven points and six blocks. Eliza Garlough had 12 digs and six points and Ashley McKee put up two kills with 42 assists. For Columbiana, Dee Dixon had four blocks, four kills and three digs, Rae Dixon had three digs and nine points, Brynn Pennell had 13 digs and 11 assists and Alexis Cross finished with 12 digs, three kills and two points. \nSouth Range next will face Liberty on Thursday at 7 p.m. \n“I think it was just about our side of the court just playing like my girls playing like they know how and our team stepping up and playing South Range volleyball,” Storm-Baker said. \nUnited-Ursuline \nThe Golden Eagles easily dispatched the Irish in three games (25-14, 25-7, 25-12). \n“You never want to underestimate anybody, but I didn’t think they had the experience to beat us,” United coach Don Conser said. \nUrsuline’s inability to consistently return serves led to the defeat, as evidenced by the Golden Eagles’ Logan Daggy racking up a team-high 14 service points. What few serves the Irish could return were often easy for the Golden Eagles to convert into scoring opportunities. \n“We would just serve to the spots that my Dad and my coach would tell us to go to and I just hit my spots overtime,” Daggy said. \nDaggy also added 11 assists and nine kills. Sophomore Camryn Jarrett had a Golden Eagle-high 10 kills, five service points and two assists. An open-enrollment student at United, the sophomore has been a revelation for the Golden Eagles since she’s been cleared to play in matches. Because of her open enrollment status, Jarrett was permitted to practice with the team, but could not participate in any games or scrimmages. \n“Once she sat out the first 11, we’ve only lost one since and that was to some team called South Range,” Conser said of Jarrett. “She makes a big difference.” \nUnited will return to Salem to face Waterloo, a team the Golden Eagles faced in the preseason, in the next round of district play Thursday at 5:30 p.m. \n“We were pretty relaxed out there because we knew this would be one of the easier games that we have, but we know it’s going to be harder from here on out, so we have to start working harder and harder if we want to get to where we want to be,” Daggy said.
