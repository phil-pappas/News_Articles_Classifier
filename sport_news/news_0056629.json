Farrell set to manage Red Sox in 2016 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Cleveland\nThe Boston Red Sox announced that manager John Farrell, who left the club in August after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, will be back next season. The 53-year-old Farrell recently completed his final course of chemotherapy treatments in Boston.\n\"It's the right thing to do from an organizational perspective,\" Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said. \"He's won before. He deserves it. We look forward to us bouncing back in 2016.\"\nIn addition to announcing Farrell's return, the Red Sox signed bench coach Torey Lovullo to a two-year contract extension. Lovullo filled in as Boston's interim manager after Farrell left on Aug. 14. Lovullo will return to being the club's bench coach.\nAlso, the Red Sox said hitting coach Chili Davis, pitching coach Carl Willis and third-base coach Brian Butterfield will be back in 2016. First-base Arnie Beyeler is not being retained.\nBoston went 78-84 and finished last in the AL East for the second straight year, concluding with a 3-1 loss to the Cleveland Indians on Sunday.\nThe Red Sox have posted consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1993-94.\nFarrell will have more tests in about three weeks, according to Dombrowski, who added he has been told Farrell's full recovery could take up to six months.\nThe club also gave Torey Lovullo, Boston's bench coach who served as interim manager while Farrell was out, a two-year contract extension through 2017. Lovullo waived his right to pursue managerial openings, and with him under contract, Boston has protection in case Farrell can't come back.\nLovullo is looking forward to working alongside Farrell again.\n\"It's great news,\" Lovullo said. \"We're excited because we're looking for his good health. That's the most important thing here. All along we were all assuming John was coming back. There was never any doubt in my mind or the rest of the coaching staff's mind. This is John's team. It's his job.\"\nFarrell was hired as Boston's manager in October 2012 and led the Red Sox to a World Series title in his first season. He signed a two-year contract extension in February through the 2017 season with club holding an option for 2018.\nLovullo said the opportunity to stay on Farrell's staff outweighed any personal ambitions.\n\"It was a difficult decision for me,\" said Lovullo, who guided the Red Sox to a 28-20 record \"It just felt right to be here. It just felt right to stay here. It just felt right to see this through. I have a love for the organization. I have a love for John. I have a love for the players.\"\nDavid Ortiz doubled home Boston's only run in the first inning. Sunday's loss ended a season in which he surpassed 500 career homers and finished with 108 RBIs.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739252/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739255/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739251/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739253/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739255/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739254/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739252/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739253/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739251/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739254/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:55:29.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
