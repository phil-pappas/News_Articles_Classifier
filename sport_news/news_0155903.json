Show Caption Previous Next \nFORT MYERS — This season’s Florida Gulf Coast University women’s basketball team will look a lot like the one that won an NCAA tournament game last season and was ranked No. 20 in the nation. \nThe Eagles took the court Monday for their first official preseason practice with 11 players back from last year’s team that went 31-3. But FGCU also has a handful of new additions the Eagles think can make them even better than last year, when it enjoyed the best season in its 13-year history. \n“We have big shoes to fill,” redshirt senior Kady Schrann said. “We need people to step up, especially the new people, to help us get back to the NCAA tournament.” \nFGCU returns four starters and 81.6 percent of its points scored last season. However, the Eagles will look to four eligible newcomers to push them over the top and into the Sweet 16, the team’s long-term goal. \nSchrann is eligible for the first time after transferring from Vanderbilt last season. Tayler Goodall is a redshirt freshman after sitting out last season on a deep team. Sierra Harley is able to play immediately following her transfer from junior college this summer. \nAnother new player, Sydnei McCaskill, will be eligible in January, when her NCAA-required one-year waiting period is over after transferring from Georgia this past January. \nSchrann and Goodall practiced with the team last season, but Monday was different. The 6 a.m. practice — and another at 4:30 p.m. — was the first time they were working toward a game they knew they could play in. The Eagles open the season Nov. 13 at North Carolina A&T. \n“I learned a lot last year,” Goodall said, “but it seems like it’s been forever since I played.” \nA 5-foot-9 guard, Goodall hasn’t played in a meaningful game since her senior year at Columbus (Ind.) North High School. She averaged 16.3 points as a senior (2013-14), hit 44 percent of her 3-pointers and made the Indiana All-Star team. \nSmesko said Goodall is one of the top shooters on the team, which routinely is among the nation’s leaders in 3-point shooting. Last season FGCU was third in Division 1 with 9.6 3s per game. \nFGCU lost Jenna Cobb and Anthi Chatzigiakoumi to graduation. Cobb started 33 games, led the team in minutes and was fourth in scoring (8.2). Chatzigiakoumi averaged 4.5 points in 11.4 minutes. The only other players the Eagles lost from last year are transfers Morgan Blumer and Randa Payne, who combined to score 29 points in 95 minutes. \nAll three eligible additions are expected to provide added punch to an FGCU offense that scored 71.9 points per game last season, ranked 39th out of 343 Division I teams. \nSchrann, a 5-9 guard, was selected to the Southeastern Conference’s All-Freshman team in 2012. She averaged 6.7 points that season, followed by 6.4 as a junior and 4.1 as a junior. Schrann managed those numbers, FGCU coach Karl Smesko said, even though she wasn’t asked to score at Vanderbilt. \n“(Schrann) is exceptionally talented,” Smesko said. “She should be somebody that plays and contributes a lot this year.” \nAfter suffering a foot injury late last season, Schrann had surgery over the summer. Though she said she’s 100 percent healthy, Schrann still has some lingering soreness in the foot. \nHarley was a proven scorer at her previous stops. The 5-8 sophomore guard was a JUCO All-American last season, averaging 15.5 points, 5.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists while leading Owen (Ohio) Community College to a 34-2 record. She also won two state championships in high school in Columbus, Ohio. \nSchrann and Goodall have the advantage of observing Smesko’s intricate, high-motion offense for a year already. Harley didn’t join the team until June and has some catching up to do. She’ll also have to adjust to taking a secondary role, at least until she gets the hang of things, after being an All-American last year. \n“(Harley) has a lot of talent,” Smesko said. “Now can she get the mindset of, ‘I’m going to make some mistakes. Can I learn from them and start making some corrections?’ A lot for her will be depended on how quickly she can start to practice the way we practice, and start to execute things the way we execute them.” Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group.
