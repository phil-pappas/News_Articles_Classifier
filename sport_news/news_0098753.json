Nine days since media from all over the world descended on this sleepy timber town, clamoring for interviews, invading church services and shoving microphones in people's faces. Nine days since their home took center stage in the divisive national debate over gun control.\nNine days since a gunman killed nine and wounded nine before taking his own life, and now the people of Roseburg are weary. Shock has given way to angst, despair and a longing for normalcy. No one knows when it will return.\n\"He Loved His Mom And His Brother A Ton.\" Larry McGraw, family friend of Quinn Glen Cooper, spoke outside before the start of Cooper's memorial. He talked lovingly of Cooper, and thanked community members, including Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin.\n\"We're tired of everybody preying on these families,\" James Hunter, 35, told a reporter outside the memorial service for Cooper. \"This is a strain on the whole community.\"\nIn some ways, there are hints of normalcy. Most of the national media have gone home. Hotels have vacancies again. Traffic is lighter.\nPresident Barack Obama came and went.\nStill, the pain lingers. Signs everywhere, from auto parts stores to fast food restaurants, remind people to keep praying.\nAfter all, the dead are not yet buried.\nIt's a slow, grinding ritual. Three memorial services for victims were held Saturday, and two more are scheduled Sunday. The last one is for Treven Anspach — who reportedly shielded a classmate from a hail of bullets — and it won't happen for another week.\nAt each service, cameras watch as mourners file in and out, their heads lowered. People lined up with signs to show support and keep journalists at bay.\nIt has not been easy. The atmosphere grew especially tense Saturday when rumors flew that Westboro Baptist Church planned to protest the memorial services. At least a dozen volunteers showed up to fly signs of support for victims' families, and the Patriot Guard Riders — a motorcycle group made up of mostly veterans — was represented at each service, standing dutifully on guard, American flags in hand.\nMany can't wait until the outsiders — the media — leave. \"The people of Roseburg, we're tired of it,\" said Kimberly Huse, who helped organize Saturday's demonstrations. \"Nobody wants to be interviewed.\"\n\"We're Gonna Miss Him Forever. He'll Live In Our Hearts Forever.\" Larry McGraw, family friend of Quinn Glen Cooper, spoke outside before the start of Cooper's memorial. McGraw was Cooper's weight trainer.\nEvery day, it seems, a few new details emerge about what happened that morning Classroom 15. For some, it doesn't even matter.\n\"I'll never know the whole story — I wasn't there,\" said Sarah Garcia, 26. \"I'm here to support the families and show them that I love them.\"\nClasses at Umpqua are scheduled resume Monday, marking the start of what's sure to be a long healing process.\n\"Everybody is still hurting,\" said Debbie Malone, 60. \"We want to get back to normal, whatever that is.\"\nShe paused.\n\"It will never be the same again.\"\n— Ian K.
