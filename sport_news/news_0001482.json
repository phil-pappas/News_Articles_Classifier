The bus ride home from Schenectady, N.Y., is long enough without having to stew about another lost opportunity. The Wildcats erased an early 1-0 deficit Saturday night, scoring five of the next six goals in a 5-2 win over No. 18 Union to salvage the season's first road trip. Both UMass and Union were undefeated going into the weekend. \"We didn't really talk much about (the UMass) game,\" said senior alternate captain Dan Correale. \"We just tried to move on. We knew we played well in that game, we just had a bad period. We wanted to focus on the positives. We scored six goals and we wanted to take that into the game against Union because we knew they had a good defense.\" Coming off a weekend in which it never played with the lead, UNH couldn't hold one Friday night. The Wildcats had to settle for a 6-6, overtime tie in their Hockey East opener after leading 6-2 early in the third period. \"It's hard to pinpoint one thing,\" Correale said. \"Things started going in the wrong direction, and no matter what we did we couldn't stop the bleeding. We weren't helping out our goaltender or our defense at all.\" The meltdown overshadowed Correale's first career hat trick. He had four goals in the two games, including a goal and two assists against Union as UNH rallied from deficits of 1-0 and 2-1. \"We've been playing from behind,\" Correale said. \"This weekend we played with the lead. It would be nice if we could find a medium and play with a lead and keep it.\" Linemates Tyler Kelleher and Andrew Poturalski also had big games Friday night. Kelleher had four assists and Poturalski added a goal and three assists. Correale, Kelleher and Poturalski combined for seven goals and 15 points in the two games over the weekend. Making his first start of the season against Union, sophomore goalie Adam Clark stopped 34 of 36 shots. \"It was a pretty good weekend as a whole,\" Correale said, \"except for one bad period against UMass. Union is a good team. It was a great win for us. We got a lot of confidence after that. \"Obviously is wasn't an ideal situation on Friday after we blew that lead,\" Correale added. \"The way we showed up the next night and how we played showed the character of our team.\" The Wildcats were coming off back-to-back, one-goal losses at home against St. Lawrence and Clarkson. They lost the first game in overtime and gave up the winning goal in the final minute of the second one. UNH (2-2-1 overall, 0-0-1 HE) plays at Merrimack next Saturday night for the third of six consecutive road games. The Wildcats snapped a three-game winless streak with the victory at Union in which five players scored goals. \"I think it's big after last weekend when we lost a couple of close games,\" Correale said. \"We felt like we should have won both. This should be a better week of practice morale-wise, and we hope to keep building off that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:36:18.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
