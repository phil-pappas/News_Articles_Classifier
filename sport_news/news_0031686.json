The linesman throws his flag only after Bielema stumbled but the video shows no contact between the two. Bielema's celebration has added to the controversy. \nTo date the original source of the video is unknown. \nCheck out photos from the game below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:43:46.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
