Despite losing to now seventh ranked LSU at home, the Orange gave the Tigers a run. Now after a week off, Syracuse is even healthier. \nThe Orange gets quarterback Eric Dungey and playmaker Erv Phillips back this week as it travels to Tampa to play USF. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nYou would think the combination of the great effort against a Top 10 team and the week off to heal would be something to build off of, but coach Scott Shafer takes an even simpler approach. \n\"I think the biggest thing for me is to try to continue where we left off with regards to focusing in on did we get better throughout the course of today? Then evaluate it and come back with a plan to get better the next day,\" said Shafer during his weekly press conference. \"Focus on the little things and try to stay true to our objectives to the season which are really to get better daily and just find daily improvements. I think it's that simplicity in the approach that helps us just focus on what will make us a better team.\" \nFrom the outside though, this looks like a really good opportunity for the Orange to get to 4-1 before the meat of conference play. \nSaturday's game at South Florida is at 3:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:06:37.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
