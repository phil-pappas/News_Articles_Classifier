She’s putting pressure on her own shoulders to show everyone that she can lead this team. But she’s an all-in kid who absolutely wears her heart on her sleeve. She plays with a lot of passion.\"\nThe go-ahead goal gave the Angels the confidence they needed. Junior goalie Kerry Sammon — athletic, smart and vocal in net — continued to shine on the county stage and finished with 11 saves. \nJunior sweeper Gabrielle Guillou, making her Angels debut after transferring from NV/Old Tappan, was a defensive force on the back line and showcased a booming leg on restarts.\nSenior Nicole Yi provided an insurance goal — assisted by Holly Slepian — after knocking home a loose ball in front of the net with 10:02 left.\nThough they were home and seeded higher than Glen Rock, it’s been the perennially strong Panthers featured in The Record Top 25 poll all season.\nHoly Angels has been on the outside looking in, but that could change.\n\"We needed a win like this,\" Delasandro said.\n\"We’re a team that’s never ranked. But we’re a strong group that keeps pushing forward. We were determined to prove that we were ready to take the next step.\"\nThe next step will be the most challenging. A date with top-seeded and undefeated Northern Highlands awaits in the round of 16.\nThe Angels know the odds are stacked against them, but they remain excited about the opportunity to measure themselves against the consensus top-ranked team in the nation.\n\"It will be fun because we’ve never played them in recent years,\" Delasandro said. \"Sometimes girls will go in with preconceived notions about what to expect. But you won’t ever know until you play them.\n\"If anything, we want to go out and prove how talented we are. If we walk away with a win, that’s amazing. But it’s more about going out there and seeing if we can hang. The girls have worked hard. We want to keep showing it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:44:00.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
