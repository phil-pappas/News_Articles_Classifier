He needs to try to really work on it, getting mentally stronger.” \nIf Kyrgios totals more than $US5000 in fines before February 24 he will have to serve the suspended ban he was slapped with in August for making a sexual comment about Stan Wawrinka’s girlfriend. \nBut the 20-year-old – who also received a code violation at last week’s Japan Open – was unperturbed about a potential ban, even with the Australian Open Grand Slam looming at the start of next season. \n“Not concerned at all. If it happens, it happens,” shrugged the world No.32, adding: “I probably shouldn’t have done it. But I didn’t think it was too bad. I don’t know, can’t really change it now.” \nWednesday’s flare-up was also not the first row between Kyrgios and umpire Mohamed Lahyani, after the Australian had to deny calling the official “dirty scum” during a match at this year’s Wimbledon. \nAustralian legend Laver and Kyrgios’s mother were in the Shanghai crowd on Wednesday when, at the end of the second set, Kyrgios smacked a loose ball with a huge backhand, forcing the line judge to take evasive action. \n“This for me is too dangerous, you hit it so hard,” Lahyani said, after issuing the code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct. \nKyrgios protested: “I didn’t even hit anyone but it’s unsportsmanlike? The ref wasn’t even close to it … well let’s just look at the tape because that’s just crap.” \nThe Australian repeatedly sparred with Lahyani and at one point shouted: “Water bro, water!” at a startled ball boy as Nishikori’s quietly impressive win was overshadowed by histrionics. \nKyrgios said afterwards: “I didn’t think I behaved bad at all out there today. I thought I was good mentally. I showed emotion, but at the same time I played great.” \nNishikori, who will play Kevin Anderson in the next round, said he did his best to ignore what was happening on the other side of the net. \n“I mean, I heard a little bit, arguing a little bit. But I tried to stay calm and concentrate on what I have to do,” the Japanese world No.6 said.
