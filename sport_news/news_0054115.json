Kansas City heading back to the World Series", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV/AP) - The Kansas City Royals are headed back to the World Series after a 4-3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays.\nIt was another tension, crazy game but the Royals won Game 6 of the ALCS. When they face the New York Mets on Opening Day in April, they will raise a second American League pennant in a row. The only question is whether it will also include a World Series banner after they beat the Mets.\nThe Royals open the World Series on Tuesday night at home against the New York Mets. A year ago, they lost in Game 7 to San Francisco largely due to an extraordinary performance by ace Madison Bumgarner. The Royals made clear coming up just short left a bitter taste in their mouths that only World Series Champagne will wash away.\n\"This year from the first day of spring training we expected to be here,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said.\nSome may question his bullpen decisions Friday night, but his faith in Alcides Escobar as leadoff hitter was rewarded. Escobar was named the series MVP.\nIt was a game of home runs, stellar defense and speedy base running. Ultimately, the Royals bullpen outperformed the Blue Jays bullpen with Kansas City closer Wade Davis getting the outs that Roberto Osuna couldn't.\nFor the second time this year and the fifth time since Oct. 1, 2014, the Royals locker room at Kauffman was drenched in Champagne and beer.\nThe Royals jumped out to an early lead. But in the eighth, Jose Bautista's second homer of the game, a two-run shot, lifted Toronto into a 3-3 tie.\nAfter a rain delay, the Royals took the lead for the last time.\nLorenzo Cain sprinted home from first base after Eric Hosmer ripped a single into right field. Davis weathered a 45-minute rain delay and a white-knuckle ninth.\nRather than hit the cutoff man, though, Bautista threw to second to keep Hosmer to a single. That gave the speedy Cain, running full speed the entire way and being waved home by third base coach Mike Jirschele, enough time to beat the relay throw from second base with a textbook slide that ignited a sellout crowd.\n\"I was hustling all the way,\" Cain said. \"I don't know what happened I just kept going.\"\nDavis retired Blue Jays star Josh Donaldson on a grounder with runners on second and third to end the game.\nThe Royals wasted no time taking the lead off David Price, the Blue Jays ace who has been so good during the regular season but remains winless in eight career postseason starts.\nZobrist pounced on the tall left-hander in the first inning, pulling a 1-1 pitch from his old Tampa Bay teammate down the left-field line. Zobrist's second homer of the series gave Kansas City the lead and sent a capacity crowd of 40,494 into a towel-waving frenzy.\nThey had hardly stopped by the time Moustakas came to bat in the second.\nAfter scrawling the initials of his late mother, Connie, into the dirt with the end of his bat, Moustakas sent a 1-2 pitch from Price screaming over the fence in right. The ball was caught by a fan, 19-year-old Caleb Humphreys, and the umpires briefly reviewed whether fan interference should be called on the play.\nThe review lasted 1 minute, 47 seconds, before crew chief John Hirschbeck announced that the replays were inconclusive. The home run stood and Kansas City had a 2-0 lead.\nRios added an RBI single in the seventh, but only after two marvelous plays by Toronto limited the damage. Revere made a leaping grab at the fence to rob Salvador Perez of a two-run shot to left, and second baseman Ryan Goins made a sliding grab to rob Alex Gordon of a single.\nThe defensive plays proved critical when Ryan Madson came on to pitch the eighth.\nMadson allowed a leadoff single to Revere, and then struck out Donaldson, before peering in at Bautista in the box. The home run hitter who irked Kansas City fans all series followed his solo shot in the first inning with a tying, two-run homer to left that silenced the crowd â€” other than the smattering of boos directed at Madson on the mound.\nThe home run squandered a strong start by Yordano Ventura, who allowed only Bautista's first homer of the series and three other harmless hits in 5 1-3 innings. But it didn't seem to dent the confidence of the Royals, who have grown accustomed to tense postseason games.\nThere's a reason they were defending American League champions, after all.\nIn the first inning, Ventura got through a lead off double. He gave up the home run in the fourth inning to Bautista but he continued to push through.\nVentura was pulled in the the top of the sixth after he gave up a double. Reliever Kelvin Herrera immediately came in throwing fire and got an immediate strikeout. He walked off the mound to roars with the man still standing on second.\nPrice was pulled in the seventh inning. Stellar defense by Toronto stopped some big hits, but Alex Rios got a single off reliever Aaron Sanchez. That single allowed Moustakas to score. Paulo Orlando then stepped in as a pinch runner for Rios.\nIn the eighth with the Royals up 3-1, Yost didn't bring in Davis to get the last six outs. Instead, he turned to Madson who got rocked in Game 4 of the ALDS. Madson gave up a single. A home run from Bautista tied the game 3-3.\nDavis who would admit after the game that he woke up sick and dizzy, got the last two outs of the top of the eighth. The game then went into a rain delay. The tarp was pulled off at 10:25 p.m.\nThe game resumed at 10:45 p.m.\nThe Blue Jays and Royals are two scrappy teams that have repeatedly fought off playoff elimination. The Blue Jays routed the Royals 7-1 in Game 5 to secure their trip south to Kansas City.\nToronto also rallied from a 2-0 deficit to beat Texas in the best-of-five AL Division Series and have won four straight this postseason while facing elimination. But the Royals are kings when it comes to staving off elimination in historic fashion (Here's looking at you Oakland and Houston).\nFor the Blue Jays, it was a frustrating ending to a late-season surge that ended their own postseason drought dating to 1993. They had rallied from a 2-0 series deficit against Texas in the divisional round, then staved off elimination against the Royals in Game 5 in Toronto.\nThey simply couldn't win their sixth straight elimination game.\nAnd the Royals are headed back to the World Series, hoping to raise the trophy they barely missed last year.\n\"The story just keeps better and better,\" Hosmer said. \"I can't waiting to be fighting on the big stage with these guys in a couple of days.\"\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) and Associated Press.
