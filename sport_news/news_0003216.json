But there also is another starting five that will go a long way toward determine a potential climb from lottery lament to playoff possibilities.\nTo that end, we offer five factors for a return to relevance.\n1. There's no easing into this. Win early . . . or perish.\nYes, it is a long season and, yes, this is a team that exited the preseason still in search of an identity. But the Heat's schedule is set up almost as an all-or-nothing test. It's practically all home games at the outset, and then almost nothing at AmericanAirlines Arena when the calendar turns to January and February.\nKick away a few of the opening games and the challenge grows exponentially more difficult.\nNot only are 14 of the first 19 games at home, but 11 of those 19 are against teams that were in the lottery last season. Included in that early stretch is a season-long seven-game homestand and then another four-game homestand.\nWinderman sums up Heat preseason, looks ahead Ira Winderman wraps up the Heat''s 4-4 preseason and sets the stage for Wednesday's season opener against the Hornets.\nIra Winderman wraps up the Heat''s 4-4 preseason and sets the stage for Wednesday's season opener against the Hornets.\nSee more videos The scheduling essentially affords the Heat the opportunity to hold mini-camps in the midst of the start of the season, stringing together several consecutive days of practice.\nThe payback, however, is harsh, with a run of 14 of 16 on the road starting on Jan. 8, a run that includes a brutal six-game western swing and then a five-game east swing against teams that all made the playoffs last season.\nThe mantra for the Heat in recent seasons has been about the \"process\" and of \"developing an identity\" as the season progresses. Such an approach with this schedule could prove fatal.\nA look at the Heat roster, with salary status and how each player might contribute this season.\n(Ira Winderman) The Heat have to start winning early and often. The November schedule is about creating a cushion for the blows that could follow.\n2. Preventative maintenance will be essential.\nThis is not last season's roster, when it eventually became Henry Walker, Michael Beasley or bust. There is enough quality, proven depth in place to allow the Heat to survive the occasional minor ailment.\nBut the quality of the depth is not enough to overcome an extended absence by any of the starters. In order for this to work, Hassan Whiteside, Chris Bosh, Luol Deng, Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic have to be working together extensively. There is no plug-and-play replacement for any of the starters.\nWhat that means is that Erik Spoelstra has to practice prudence when it comes to guiding his older roster through the season, but also, to paraphrase Pat Riley, remember that \"the main thing is the main thing.\" And the main thing for the Heat this season is the starting lineup.\n3. Whiteside, Whiteside, Whiteside.\nWas it fact or flash, what Whiteside offered over the second half of last season? Can it be replicated over the course of an entire season now that the double-teams, hard fouls and scouting reports are about to enter the equation?\nWhy does Whiteside's at-the-rim game matter so much? Because look at the rest of the power rotation, where Bosh is hoisting 3-pointers, Josh McRoberts is passing out of the high post, Amar'e Stoudemire is shooting baseline jumpers, Chris Andersen is saving his 37-year-old legs for the defensive end and Udonis Haslem's lift has almost been extinguished.\nNo single player impacts the Heat on both ends of the court as much as Whiteside. He has to pick up where he left off.\n4. Win the space race.\nNBA offense is predicated on spacing. While 3-point shooting is considered the simplest path to such spacing, there are other avenues.\nAnd those alternate avenues might be what the Heat, with their lack of 3-point threats, will have to traverse this season.\nIt could be early offense, players getting to scoring positions before the defense sets. It could be vertical spacing, the threat of alley-oop passes that keeps defenders deep in the paint. It could be rapid ball movement.\nBased on the lack of spacing during the preseason, it has to be something, perhaps even adding a 3-point threat or developing one beyond the current percentage.\n5. No agendas.\nWhiteside is playing for a career contract. Wade expects to cash in again before cashing out for his career. Deng, Andersen, Mario Chalmers, Haslem, Gerald Green, Stoudemire and Tyler Johnson all are in the final year of their contracts.\nAll need or want to get numbers. There won't be enough statistics to go around.\nSating individual needs or getting them in alignment with team goals will be among Spoelstra's greatest challenges with a roster loaded with independent contractors.\nwinderman@tribpub.com.
