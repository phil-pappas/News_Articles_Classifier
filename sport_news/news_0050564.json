As the Giants desperately tried to climb back into their game on Monday night, they tried everything they could think of doing to get their offense going. Everything, it seemed, but the obvious.\nBut it wasn't an accident that Odell Beckham, by far their best playmaker and most dangerous weapon, had only one ball thrown in his direction in the second half of the Giants' 27-7 loss in Philadelphia. It was, oddly, a conscious decision. The Eagles defense kept him double covered for most of the second half, and when that happens Eli Manning looks to throw to someone else.\nEven if that someone else is a gimpy Rueben Randle. Or Dwayne Harris. Or Myles White.\nIt doesn't seem like a smart idea to take the ball out of the hands of one of the NFL's best receivers. When a quarterback has a weapon that spectacular, shouldn't he occasionally try to throw to him, no matter what?\n\"I don't think that's a smart decision. So, no,\" Manning said. \"We've got other guys who have to win and just read the coverages and make good decisions and go where the defense is telling you to go with the ball.\"\nThat has been the Giants' stubborn philosophy for almost the entire Tom Coughlin and Manning Era. It's part of why they also seem to throw the ball in far too many short-yardage or late-game situations where the obvious call is to run. Manning's primary job is to survey the defense, find the weak spot and exploit it. And he is absolutely brilliant at finding a defense's holes.\nBut there is something to be said, too, for not allowing a defense to dictate what the Giants offense does. Of course they're going to do their best to take Beckham out of the game. Of course he's going to be the focus of their coverage.\nSo throw it to him anyway. Let him beat the defense. Maybe he'll make a catch in double-coverage. Maybe he'll draw a penalty. Maybe he'll find a way to get open no matter how many defensive backs are trying to surround him.\nIsn't that a better strategy than relying so heavily on the inconsistent Randle, or Harris or White? Isn't the Giants' offense much better, much more dangerous, much more explosive, when the ball is headed towards Beckham's hands?\nOf course it is. Or so you'd think.\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News When in doubt, the Giants need to throw the ball to Odell Beckham. \"If (Beckham) is getting doubled, we can't force the ball into double coverage,\" said offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo. \"We have to let everyone else make plays, and step up and take advantage of their opportunities.\"\n\"I don't think the theme of our offense is 'Hey, how many times can we get the ball to Odell?'\" Manning added. \"It's about finding completions and going where the defense is telling us, and moving the ball. If it's not there (with Beckham), or they're playing a different coverage, or stuff happens, I'm going through my progressions. And we've got a lot of guys who can make plays for us.\"\nThat, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. Randle (24 catches, 261 yards, two touchdowns) definitely has that ability, at times. Tight end Larry Donnell (24-183-2) has it to an extent, when he's holding on to the football. The jury, meanwhile, remains out on Harris (13-141-1), rookie Geremy Davis (2-21-0) or White (0-0-0).\nThe strategy would make much more sense if the Giants' second receiver was Victor Cruz, but he's still out with a calf injury and Manning has hinted he might not return until after the Giants' late-November bye. That means, for most of the season the Giants' options will be to throw to Beckham or take their chances elsewhere.\nClearly the defenses want the Giants to look elsewhere. That doesn't mean the Giants have to give in to their demands. And yet they have. All season, in fact. Manning has thrown to Beckham 60 times in six games, but just 19 times (31.7 percent) in the second half. It's why he has huge first-half numbers (27-361-2) and paltry second-half numbers (11-128-2).\nDefenses are winning the battle of the Beckham because the Giants are letting them win.\n\"We want to target Odell as much as possible,\" McAdoo said. \"He's a play maker, a heck of a player in this league. (But) we're not going to go in and say we want to target him a certain number of times each game. Although we definitely don't want him to disappear in the second half.\"\nThe fact that he has, McAdoo said, is not Beckham's fault or Manning's fault. He blamed \"a bunch of different things.\" But again, those things are only a factor if they let them be a factor. Sometimes it really is as simple as just throwing him the ball. It's not unreasonable for an offense to stare down a defense and say \"We know you know what's coming, and we're going to beat you anyway.\" By ignoring Beckham for long stretches, by not giving him a chance to win the really difficult battles, the Giants are doing exactly the opposite.\nThat trend has to stop, otherwise defenses will find ways to make Beckham irrelevant. And that would be terrible for the Giants, because given the state of their offense and their death of playmakers, Beckham - no matter how many defenders are around him - is clearly the best option they've got.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:09:52.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
