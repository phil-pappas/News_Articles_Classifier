The national junior hockey squad has certainly stepped up their games beyond their usual limit at the Sultan Johor Cup tournament which ended yesterday as they prepare for their real test – the 8th Men's Junior Asia Cup in Kuantan next month. \nThe under-21 squad, which was led by Najib Hassan for the first time at the tournament, managed to clinch third place, improving the last tournament ranking of fifth place, after defeating Argentina 3-2 in a heart-stopping game yesterday. \nMalaysian Hockey Confederation (MHC) technical director Terry Walsh said the team did an incredible job and being third in the tournament was a good outcome for the players. \n\"The quality of games has been very good. Although most of the teams will not be playing in Kuantan, it is good for the team to be able to play against good teams like Great Britain, Australia and Argentina,\" he told Bernama when met on the sidelines of the final day of the tournament. \nWalsh, who oversees the development of the junior and senior hockey teams, said it has been an effective tournament for the junior squad as they tested a lot of tactics and strategies, as well as learned from their competitors, especially as they prepare themselves for the 8th Men's Junior Asia Cup in Kuantan next month. \nThe competition, to be held from November 14 to 22 this year at the Wisma Belia Hockey Stadium, Kuantan, is a stepping stone for the juniors to qualify for the Junior Hockey World Cup which will be held in New Delhi, India next year. \n\"You would expect them to be sharper in Kuantan. In preparation for any tournament, you wouldn't know what the liabilities are going to be in penalty corners, but they had such good outcomes during this tournament. We have a reasonable chance to perform better in Kuantan,\" he said. \nDuring the tournament, the junior squad gave other teams a run for their money with three wins, two losses and one draw against other five teams – India, Great Britain, Argentina, Australia and Pakistan. \nThey translated most of their penalty corners during the game with Muhammad Shahril Saabah and Muhd Najmi Farizal Jazlan helming the important task, while goalkeeper Mohammad Ridzwan Azmi and the defenders led by Najib played an incredible job in keeping away opponents from the Malaysian goal. \nCoach A. Arulselvaraj said the team would be resting for a few days before heading to Kuantan on October 26 for intensive training and to familiarise themselves with their competition environment. \nIt is still unclear whether Sufi Ismat and Rafizul Ezry Mustafa, who were absent during the Sultan Johor Cup with hamstring injuries, will join the squad in Kuantan. \nApplauding the team's performance during the tournament, Arulselvaraj said the players managed to get their mindset right from the start by pushing themselves more than before. \n\"We have more tricks up the sleeve which we will be able to show in Kuantan. This tournament have been very valuable for us as we were able to analyse our opponent's strengths and weaknesses, especially India and Pakistan whom we will be meeting there,\" he said. \nMalaysia will be competing in Group A of the Men’s Junior Asia Cup, alongside India, Japan and China. – Bernama, October 19, 2015. \nShare with others", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:44:35.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
