He moved with his mother to Roseburg in 2013.\nIan Mercer said he knew little about his son's mental state leading up to the shooting, adding, \"Obviously someone who goes and kills nine people has to have had some kind of issue.\"\nMercer was incredulous that his son had been able to buy the six weapons he used in the shooting and eight others recovered from his residence.\n\"How is it so easy to get all these guns?\" Mercer said. \"I've never held a gun in my life. You have to ask the question, how did he compile such an arsenal?\"\nThe Oregon State Police had earlier released a statement the agency said was provided by a spokesman for Harper-Mercer's family: \"We are shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific events that unfolded on Thursday, October 1. Our thoughts, our hearts and our prayers go out to all of the families of those who died and were injured.\"\n-- Elliot Njus\nenjus@oregonian.com\n503-294-5034\n@ enjus", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/enjus"], "published": "2015-10-03T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:23:39.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
