Banks had 26 carries, 398 yards and six touchdowns as he helped The Colony come back from two early touchdown deficits and go on to win 63-43. He gave The Colony a lead it never relinquished with a 59-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, then followed that with a 67-yard touchdown run (on 3rd and 16) just before halftime, which pushed him over 300 yards in the half. Banks also had one reception for 27 yards.\nWho is he? A 6-1, 205-pound senior running back.\nThe stats: Banks has rushed 213 times this year for 1,610 yards and 23 touchdowns. He also leads the team in receiving yards with 7 receptions for 223 yards and two touchdowns.\nHe said it: \"I came in at halftime and my coach came up to me and was like, 'You know, you're on pace to break the record' (587 rushing yards). I was like, 'Really?' He was like, 'Yeah, you can break the record if you have the same half as you did in the first half.' I came out and I broke another run. I thought I was going to be able to break it. Then that's when they went on an eight-minute drive, and my coach was like, 'No, we're not going to try to do it.'\"\nCoach said it: \"His sophomore year he was more of a bang guy. Last year, same kind of deal ... In the offseason last year he gained the speed. Instead of him getting 40, 50 yards, when he gets open, he finishes runs, and that's been the biggest difference between this year and last year.\" -- Rudy Rangel\nDid you know? The win improved The Colony's District 9-5A record to 3-3. That puts them in fifth place and one win behind fourth-place Frisco Centennial (4-3) for the final district playoff spot. The two face each other in the last week of the regular season. ... Banks is a labeled as a three-star recruit in 247 Sports' composite rankings. He said Colorado State is his favorite school right now, but he's also talking to Texas A&M and hasn't decided where he wants to go yet.\nHonorable Mention\nLawson Ayo Sunnyvale Sr. WR 10 receptions, 189 yards, 3 TDs Roderick Brown Mesquite Sr. WR 5 receptions, 138 yards, 2 TDs Shane Buechele Arlington Lamar Sr. QB 11 for 18, 229 yards, 3 TDs, 15 carries, 134 yards, 2 TDs Reggie Chaney Frisco Liberty So.
