The items were sold for $5 a piece or less, some with the tags still on them, at a pre-race fitness expo Sunday. \nThe money goes to Goodwill programs that help people with disabilities, families with insecure housing, veterans, people returning to work, unemployed or underemployed youth and others. \n___ \nInformation from: The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:51:54.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
