(KTTC) - The Kenyon-Wanamingo volleyball team is turning heads one upset after another. There is an elevated level of spirit thanks to outside hitter Mara Quam. \n\"I think I build the energy a lot,\" Quam said. \"I'm like a little energy bug on our team.\" \nHer energy has helped the Knights climb the Class AA rankings to fifth place. In the past two weeks, Quam and her teammates have taken down formidable opponents like Hayfield, 9th ranked Kasson-Mantorville and even 2nd ranked Stewartville. \n\"We knew we wanted it so badly and last year we beat Stewartville and it was just so much fun and we knew we could do it,\" Quam said. \nThe junior led her team with 48 kills and 78 digs combined over those three games. She also leads the Knights with 304 kills and 55 aces on the season... \n\"Maura brings a lot of versatility to our team,\" head coach Jen Nerison said. \"She's comfortable attacking from the front row, she's comfortable attacking from the back row,. I think she's a really good role model to the rest of her teammates and to the young ones as well.\" \nFor Mara, volleyball is a family affair. Her mother played back in high school and oldest sister Siri is a senior setter for the Knights, something that both Quam girls enjoy. Usually. \n\"Well it helps most of the time,\" Mara joked. 'Sometimes there's tension between us but most of the time we work together really well.\" \n\"She works so hard at everything she does and she inspires me even,\" Siri Quam said. \"It's fun to play with her and I think anyone that plays with her thinks it's fun to play with her.\" \nWith their goals set on a trip to the state tournament, the road doesn't get any easier for Kenyon-Wanamingo and the Quam sisters. But with the confidence Mara has installed in her teammates, coach Nerison thinks that anything is possible. \n\"When it comes down to those points where we need to get a point to get back the momentum, they're going to turn a lot to Mara,\" Nerison said. \"I think they definitely look to her as a leader.\" Mobile Top Stories More>> Rochester City Council approves ordinance in wake of Chateau Circle disagreement The Chateau Circle project found itself back in the spotlight at Monday night's city council meeting.A public commenter said the developer removed trees at the site without permission as the council passed an ordinance to prevent future miscommunications.
