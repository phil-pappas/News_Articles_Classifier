Comment   Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 3:14 PM By Dave Roberts Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 3:14 PM ST. JAMES, Mo. It appears the St. James High School football squad will be without senior quarterback Brett Karnes the rest of the season due to a knee injury. So the offensive unit that the team sent out last week against Sullivan figures to be the same this week, as the Tigers host Four Rivers Conference foe Union in the St. James Homecoming Game Friday. Kickoff at the St. James High Multi-Turf Field is set for 7 p.m. It is thought that Karnes suffered an ACL tear in his knee during the Sept. 25 game at St. Clair. He was to see a specialist this week to confirm the extent of the injury. However, St. James head coach Greg Harlan said he definitely will not play this week. St. James enters its Homecoming festivities with a 2-5 overall record and a 1-3 league mark. The Union Wildcats have struggled to a 1-6 overall and 1-3 FRC mark so far. Last week the Tigers fell at Sullivan 21-7 while Union was beaten by Owensville 32-14. The usually potent Union spread offense has been somewhat tame this season, as the Wildcats are averaging just 16.0 points per game. And Union has had problems on defense, allowing an average of 34.1 points after seven games. “Union has had struggles all season,” Harlan said. “We’ve been on the road for three weeks and it’s a good chance to come back for homecoming. We have played well in front of our home crowd all year.” The Tigers will have to slow down the passing of senior quarterback Jerod Mattingly. Mattingly has hit on 91-of-114 passes for 1,089 yards, four interceptions and nine touchdowns. The Wildcats have a trio of receivers Mattingly likes to find. Senior wideout Ryan Schumaker has caught 26 passes for 444 yards and three touchdowns while junior wideout Deric Purnell has 28 receptions for 297 yards and three TDs and senior wideout Blake Pickard 20 catches for 205 yards and a TD. Union has rushed for just 255 yards this season, led by Mattingly with 98. Junior linebacker Drew Reed paces the Wildcat defense with 38 solo tackles and 31 assists while Schumaker, a defensive back, has 37 solo tackles and nine assists, sophomore linebacker Jacob Fleming 31 solos and 13 assists and senior linebacker Nick Kretzler 26 solos and 16 assists. “They run a similar offense to us,” Harlan said. “They have some athletes and throw the ball a lot. Most concerning to us is that we have struggled tackling in space. We’ve got to rely on getting 11 guys to the football to corral their speed. “The strength of their defense has been their coverage. Teams have had more success running on them. And Ryan (Harlan), Dawson (Lynch) and Gunnar (Seams) all have the capabilities of breaking big plays in the running game.” Page 2 of 2 - Last week Karnes’ replacement at QB, sophomore Ryan Harlan, hit on 18-of-30 passes for 235 yards and four interceptions while rushing for 70 yards on 20 carries. Harlan was the Tigers’ leading receiver before making the move to QB, having caught 35 passes for 440 yards and seven TDs. Harlan now has 145 rushing yards on 30 carries and has scored a total of 10 touchdowns to lead the squad. Lynch, a junior running back, has 400 rushing yards on 86 carries to pace STJ. Senior wideout Michael Phillips now has 20 catches for 413 yards and six touchdowns for the Tigers while senior wideout Tyler Glidden has 17 catches for 183 yards, senior tight end Thomas Casto 14 catches for 176 yards and three TDs and Lynch 26 catches for 342 yards and three TDs. “I felt pretty comfortable last week,” Greg Harlan said of his new-look offense. “Ryan has ran one quarter of jayvee quarterback all year for us. We have got to get him and the receivers on the same page, and after playing together last week I think they will be more comfortable.” Defensively for St. James senior linebacker Justin Taft has 33 solo tackles and 21 assists while junior defensive back Luke Bartle has 35 solos and 15 assists, junior end Trenton Ruddy 29 and 17, sophomore lineman Drake Ortiz 33 and 19, senior linebacker Gage Melton 35 and eight, senior defensive back Tyler Conway 30 and 13, defensive back Lynch 31 and seven and senior lineman Sam Williams 30 and nine.
