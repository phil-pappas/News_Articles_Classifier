Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:51 PM Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:51 PM TALLAHASSEE — If Dalvin Cook was feeling any ill effects from the hamstring pull he suffered in last week’s game against Wake Forest, you’d have a hard time convincing Miami of it after Saturday night. Considered questionable to play through much of the week, Cook delivered another monster performance with 269 total yards and three touchdowns to lift the Seminoles to a 29-24 victory. It was the sixth straight win over the Hurricanes for FSU (5-0, 3-0 in ACC play), and for the second straight year, it was a late touchdown run by Cook that proved the difference. Cook rushed for 222 yards and two touchdowns and added a 36-yard receiving touchdown, providing the knockout blow with a 23-yard touchdown run with 6:44 left to play. “He’s one of the best pure football players in college football,” FSU coach Jimbo Fisher said of his sophomore running back. “That guy’s different, man. He’s got something different about him. I’m glad he’s on my team.” Trailing for the first time in the fourth quarter this season after a 29-yard touchdown pass from Brad Kaaya to Stacy Coley made it 24-23 with 10:02 left, the Seminoles answered with perhaps their most impressive drive of the season. Starting from their own 14, the Seminoles marched 86 yards on eight plays, getting a pair of big third-down conversions by Everett Golson and two explosive runs by Cook. Facing a third-and-8 from the FSU 18-yard line, Golson stepped up into the pocket against pressure and drilled a bullet down the middle to Bobo Wilson for 20 yards to keep the drive going. After a 7-yard run by Golson converted a third-and-1 to the Miami 46, Cook hit a 23-yard run down the right sideline, and delivered another one on the ensuing play to put FSU back in the lead. The two-point conversion failed, leaving the door open for Miami down five with a chance to win it with a late touchdown. But the Hurricanes (3-2, 0-1) went three-and-out on their next series and turned it over on downs on their final possession, as Giorgio Newberry deflected a Kaaya pass on fourth-and-4 with 1:28 left. While the Seminoles continue to have the upper hand in the series, Fisher said Saturday’s game was about as good as it gets in what was once college football’s premier rivalry. “My hats off to Miami,” he said. “We knew they would come in and play well, knew they wouldn’t quit. We knew they would play hard. They coached one heck of a game and played one heck of a game. That’s what Miami-Florida State is supposed to be about. That’s what it’s always been and always should be. It’s a privilege to be a part of that rivalry.” Page 2 of 3 - FSU’s first two conference games were competitive with relatively narrow margins of victory of 14 and eight points, but Saturday was certainly the stiffest test the Seminoles have faced this season. Fisher said he couldn’t have been happier with how his young players stepped up to the challenge. “The thing I was most proud about was we didn’t worry about anything else except the next play,” he said. “That’s how we’ve got to play. We have to trust the process of how we do things. If the process is right, the outcome will become right. We’ve just got to worry about getting better ever week. We’ve got a bunch of babies out there, but they grew up tonight. I’m extremely proud of them.” Miami coach Al Golden said he was proud of the effort of his team on the road, but it’s a tough way to lose for a program in need of a big win. “I’m just really disappointed for our guys,” he said. “I thought they were resilient. I thought they believed. Despite going down early, they stayed together and we had opportunities to win. Give (FSU) credit. They ran the ball really well and their quarterback protected it.” Kaaya finished 29-of-49 for 405 yards and three touchdowns, while Golson was 25-of-33 for 291 yards and a touchdown. The Miami quarterback was working without the benefit of a running threat for most of the night, as the Hurricanes totaled just 20 yards on the ground for the game and top rusher Joseph Yearby finished with 33 yards on 15 carries. By contrast, the Seminoles had 248 yards rushing and outgained Miami 539-425 for the game. While Miami didn’t get in gear until the second half, the FSU offense was dominant from the outset, compiling 358 total yards in the first half while marching into the red zone on five of six series and not punting once. Cook scored on his first touch of the game, taking an option pitch from Golson and racing down the left sideline untouched for a 72-yard score. Cook struck again on FSU’s second series, finishing off a three-play, 75-yard drive by catching a short pass out to the flats to from Golson and beating the Miami defense to the corner and then cutting inside to cross the goal line for a 36-yard score to make it 14-3. The sophomore hit another big run early in the second quarter when he broke through the middle of the Miami defense and ripped off 35 yards, but he pulled up lame with what initially appeared to be a re-injury of the hamstring that took him out of last week’s game against WakeForest. Page 3 of 3 - But it turned out to be a cramp and Cook returned to the game two series later and rushed for 17 yards to spark another scoring drive for FSU, this one resulting in Roberto Aguayo’s second field goal of the half to make it 20-10 with 2:42 to halftime. Miami got on the board on its first possession of the game with a 30-yard field goal by Michael Badgley to cap off an 11-play, 62-yard drive, then found the end zone for the first time with a big pass play in the second quarter. With a first down at their own 42, the Hurricanes got a 58-yard touchdown connection from Kaaya to Rashawn Scott when the latter grabbed a back shoulder throw against Jalen Ramsey and reached the end zone after FSU safety Lamarcus Brutus overran the play. The score cut FSU’s lead to 17-10 with 11 minutes to half. The Seminoles had a chance to tack on another score in the final seconds of the second quarter, but Aguayo’s 49-yard field goal attempt bounced off the right upright and was no good. Miami cut deeper into the lead with 17-play, 80-yard drive on its first series of the second half, with Kaaya completing 7-of-11 for 74 yards on the drive, including a 1-yard touchdown to Yearby on third-and-goal to make it 20-17. A 25-yard field goal by Aguayo put FSU up 23-17 with 11:58 left in the fourth. But Miami drove right back down on the ensuing series with Kaaya hitting passes of 23 and 20 yards to Herb Waters and David Njoku before throwing a deep fade route to Coley, who made a spectacular leaping grab for the touchdown. Coley caught seven passes for 139 yards and a touchdown, while Scott had six grabs for 108 yards and a score. Kermit Whitfield led FSU with nine catches for 95 yards. FSU will play host to Louisville next week, while Miami (3-2, 0-1) hosts Virginia Tech.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:07:25.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
