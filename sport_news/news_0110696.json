The Pats showed they had no hard feelings after the Colts' complaints to the league prompted the long, tedious Deflategate investigation, the NFL's suspension of Tom Brady and the overturning of that suspension in federal court. They showed that by treating the Colts just like every other opponent they have faced this season - handing them defeat. After New England's 34-27 victory, the team sits comfortably at 5-0. The Colts, now 3-3 on the season, actually led 21-20 at halftime. After that, though, the Patriots scored two touchdowns and held their opponents to a late fourth-quarter touchdown - and for good measure, linebacker Jamie Collins leaped over everybody to block the extra point. Brady was characteristically effective, going 23-37, throwing for 312 yards and three touchdown passes. He did throw his first interception of the season - a pick-six to safety Mike Adams - but it came on a pass wide receiver Julian Edelman bobbled. Edelman was otherwise solid, making six catches for 50 yards and a touchdown of his own. Brady hit Rob Gronkowski and running back LeGarrette Blount for touchdown passes, as well, but it was Danny Amendola who came alive for 105 yards, making seven catches on nine targets. Blount ran for a touchdown, too, and for 93 yards. Defensively, Chandler Jones was impressive with three sacks on Andrew Luck, who matched Brady's 312 yards and three touchdowns. He went 30-50 on the night. The Pats will look to stay undefeated next week against the New York Jets.
