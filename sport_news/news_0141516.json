Hinch, ignoring the live TV cameras in the middle of the clubhouse, giving a brief, profanity-laden celebratory speech, as his players sprayed him in the face with beer and champagne. \nThere is Astros outfielder Colby Rasmus, running around the clubhouse shirtless and feeling too exhilarated to even feel the ice-cold beverages being dumped over his head. \nThere is Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow, walking around in a swim suit and flip-flops as if he's going to the beach, and not to the postseason, admiring it all in the back of the room with team president Reid Ryan. \nThe Astros, who have made their clubhouse celebrations legendary after regular-season victories, saved their best for Sunday, winning an American League wild card berth - even after losing, 5-3, to the Arizona Diamondbacks - and advancing to the postseason for the first time in 10 years. \nThey will be the Cinderella story of the postseason, facing the longest odds, beginning with a winner-take-all game Tuesday night against the powerful New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. \nYet, instead of showing any fear, any disappointment that their loss prevented them from hosting the wild-card game, they actually are savoring the idea they're taking their act to New York. \nThis is where legends are made, and judging by the bravado displayed in the Astros' clubhouse, the Yankees should be the ones afraid. \nThe Houston Astros are going to the playoffs for the first time in a decade despite ending the regular season with a 5-3 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday. (Photo: Darin Wallentine) \nJust listen. \n\"Nobody else outside this clubhouse thought we had a chance,'' Hinch yelled to his team in the middle of the clubhouse. \"You can say a lot of things about this team, right? \n\"Well, the one thing they'll say forever, is that we're a (expletive) playoff team. \n\"It's going to take a few more wins, and we're going to have to earn them, but I'll bet on this team. \n\"I love you (expletives).'' \nHinch is immediately doused by his players, the music is cranked back on, and the party continues. \nThey don't plan on stopping anytime soon. \nThe Astros, with kids barely out of high school, let alone old enough to drink, are convinced they'll beat the Yankees in that wild-card game.
