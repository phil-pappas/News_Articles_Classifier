The field goal went wide right, and Tennesse's field goal troubles in Bryant-Denny stadium continued. \nAlabama capitalized on the turnover of downs as O.J Howard caught a few passes and Derrick Henry did the rest, taking it in from 20 yards for the touchdown to put Alabama up 7-0. \nTennessee answered the Tide, marching down the field and scoring on a 10-play, 75-yard drive in 4:14. The drive was capped off on a Josh Dobbs pass to Josh Smith. \nPlay was quiet until halfway through the second quarter. The Tide were inside the Tennessee 40 and driving, until Jake Coker was picked off by Brian Randolph. The Tide's drive ended abruptly, but Tennessee couldn't capitalize. \nPlay was stagnant until the end of the first half, when Tennessee had an opportunity for a deep field goal. The Volunteers missed their second of the game and it was a 7-7 game at the half. \nAlabama drove down the field on their opening possession of the second half, but couldn't punch it in at the one-yard-line. They settled for the field goal to make it 10-7. \nAlabama would add another field goal, but late in the game Tennessee took a 14-13 lead on a Jalen Hurd 12-yard rushing touchdown. \nAlabama had just a little over five minutes to answer the call, and they answered. Coker drove the Crimson Tide down the field, and Henry cleaned it up with a 14-yard run to give Alabama a 19-14 after the two-point conversion was no good. \nTennessee tried to retake the lead, but Ryan Anderson was able to strip-sack Tennessee quarterback Joshua Dobbs and Alabama jumped on the ball to seal the win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:53:08.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
