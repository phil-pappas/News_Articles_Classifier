Instead, the coach will outlast his ageless star.\nIt’s still way too far off to consider this possibility, but perhaps the 2020 Olympics will represent Popovich’s last hurrah. Either way, the next four years have legacy-cinching potential for Popovich, whose brief tenure as a USAB assistant coach produced only a bronze medal at the 2004 Greece Olympics. Gold medals at the 2019 FIBA World Cup and the 2020 Olympics would therefore represent the first such victories of his career. \n“When I was in my early 20s, we all had a dream to make an Olympic team, and that never leaves you,” Popovich continued. “You grew up and watch the Olympic Games on TV and you always want to be a part of something like that. And I’m no different from anybody else.” \n<p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> \n4. Who’s next? \nIt might be mildly surprising that Popovich is willing to undertake such a long-term commitment this late into his coaching career, but it would be a true shock if he stayed on past 2020. So, one box of speculation closes and the next one opens. Who will be in line to coach USAB after Popovich and will USAB look to find a coach who can preside for an extended period of time a la Krzyzewski? \nSome names to consider for way down the line include: Rivers (54), Stevens (39), Steve Kerr (50), and Erik Spoelstra (44). Needless to say, USAB’s coaching depth chart might be as formidable as its player roster. \n• MORE NBA: Southwest preview: Spurs, Rockets in most talented division \n5. Roster impact? \nOne major question to ask with Krzyewzki officially leaving after 2016: Will James, Anthony, Paul and others follow him into the sunset? James will be 35 by the time the 2020 Olympics rolls around, and he still hasn’t officially committed to play in Rio. Will Popovich try to lean on their mutual respect and pitch James on a honeymoon Olympics in Tokyo? That’s a question to watch moving forward. \nIf there’s a big winner in this announcement, though, it would seem to be Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard , who may be squeezed off the 2016 Rio team given the number of spots that will likely be reserved for returning USAB members. Leonard hasn’t yet played for USAB, but his positional versatility and defensive talent make him an exceptional candidate for USAB. He will be 29 during the 2019 FIBA World Cup, making him a possible centerpiece of that roster. Popovich’s hire should help Leonard’s standing in both 2019 and 2020. Who knows? Maybe Popovich can put in a good word to Krzyzewski next summer too.
