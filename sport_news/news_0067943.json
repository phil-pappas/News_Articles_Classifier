The Public School League says Cass has been declared the winner. \nBoth teams will finish the season with 8-1 overall records, 7-1 in league play. Cass lost to King 31-28 in week 5. \nThe forfeit stems from King's 20-2 semifinal win Oct. 16 against Cody (2-6) in which players from both teams fought after the game. \nCody's coaches have been suspended. The team also has been suspended for the rest of the season. \nCentral and Northwestern still will play in the league's Division 2 championship Friday at Ford Field. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:10:25.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
