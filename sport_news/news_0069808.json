(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) Comments \nUSC has fired head football coach Steve Sarkisian, the school announced Monday. \nSarkisian was forced to take a leave of absence Sunday, after he reportedly showed up for practice \"in no condition to coach.\" Numerous reports surfaced in the last 24 hours detailing Sarkisian's alleged history of alcohol abuse, both at USC and in his previous coaching stop at Washington. \nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton has been installed as interim coach. The Trojans (3-2) are at Notre Dame on Saturday. \nSarkisian also made headlines in August, when he was drunk and shouted obscenities at a USC booster function. He said at the time he did not believe he was an alcoholic and would seek treatment through the athletic department. \nTrojans athletic director Pat Haden released the following statement Monday: \n\"After careful consideration of what is in the best interest of the university and our student-athletes, I have made the decision to terminate Steve Sarkisian, effective immediately. \"I want to thank Clay Helton for stepping into the interim head coach role, and I want to add how proud I am of our coaching staff and players and the way they are responding to this difficult situation. \"Through all of this we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well being.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:21:50.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
