But Darling is still under contract with SNY, and nothing has changed that would pave the way for him to leave the booth he shares with Gary Cohen and Keith Hernandez.\nNESN’s booth is currently in flux with popular play-by-play Don Orsillo being forced out and replaced by Dave O’Brien , who The Boston Globe reported is “known to like [Darling] a lot.” Jerry Remy is the Red Sox’s analyst, but his role for next season is murky.\n“It’s 100 percent not true – it ain’t happening, that’s what I’ve been told,” Remy told The Boston Herald when asked about Darling on Wednesday.\nDarling’s broadcasting career has flourished since he joined SNY in 2006. He also has roles with MLB Network and TBS. He signed a multi-year extension with SNY following the 2013 season.\nDarling, who was part of the Mets team that rallied to beat the Red Sox in the memorable ’86 Series, spent much of his childhood in Massachusetts.\n  boston red sox ,  new york mets ,  sny", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:26:06.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
