Like any living creature who ages, Zorro no longer has the robust, perfect body of a dog who is in the prime of his life. Zorro is estimated to be nine years of age - a senior dog who may not be as spry as he once was, but he is still alive and deserving of love and kindness and the opportunity to live out the rest of his life.\nZorro's family surrendered him to the San Bernardino City Animal Control in California on October 5 - the person who gave Zorro up indicated that he likes to play with other dogs, \"like a pup.\" The following information has been written about Zorro's physical condition:\n\"He is approx 9 years old. Has cauliflower ears and hematoma on both ears, as well as growth on stomach. He is being treated with several medications. Since he was surrendered, he is not on stray hold and should be considered urgent. Not rescue only, but rescue might be his best bet.\"\nPlease help Zorro find a person who will be committed to him for what remains of his life - someone who would never consider leaving him behind. Adoption information for Zorro - Petharbor link here. Adoption inquiries should be made to the San Bernardino City Animal Control at (909) 384-1304; please ask for information about animal ID number A487212.
