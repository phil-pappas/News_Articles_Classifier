Keith Groller Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Why does coach Joe Henrich feel his team doesn't get enough credit? \nThe rare 11 a.m. start didn't throw the Bethlehem Catholic football team off schedule on Saturday. \nThe Golden Hawks proved to be effective early risers as they jumped on some Pocono Mountain East mistakes and rolled to a 46-0 Eastern Pennsylvania Conference North Division victory at Bethlehem Area School District Stadium. \nBecahi coasted to its sixth win and will travel to Stroudsburg Friday night for a battle of 6-1 teams that will likely decide the EPC North championship. \nQuarterback Julian Spigner completed 13 of 17 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown. The senior also ran for an 11-yard score on the final play of the first half. \n\"We were a little tired playing so early in the day, but we came out and took care of business,\" Spigner, a 6-foot-3, 190-pound Division I recruit, said. \"It was like we were playing a middle school game all over again. Some of us were used to it. But I'd rather play at night.\" \nPHOTO GALLERY: Pocono Mountain East plays Bethlehem Catholic (CHRIS KNIGHT / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL ) \nBecahi scored touchdowns on its first four possessions with the second score being set up by a bad snap over the head of Pocono Mountain East punter Colin Dross. Becahi took over at the Cardinals 6 and scored on the next play on an Antwon Keenan run. \nKeenan only had nine carries, but made the most of them with 109 yards and four TDs. He now has 23 TDs this season and over 900 yards on the ground on just 83 carries. \nDamian Diaz caught the TD pass from Spigner and Randy Terry III also got into the end zone as Becahi went over 40 points for the fifth time in its six-game winning streak.

(CHRIS KNIGHT / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) \n\"We're definitely excited to take the next step and take on the next challenge,\" Spigner said of the upcoming game at Stroudsburg. \"We want to show everybody that we can play with the big dogs.\" \nIn its only major test of the season so far, the Labor Day weekend opener against rival Liberty, the Golden Hawks came up short in a 39-34 final. \n\"That game shook us straight,\" Spigner said. \"We were a little too confident, a little too arrogant. Now we're more level-headed and more prepared to face a good team.\" \nSince losing to the Hurricanes, Becahi has outscored its six opponents 276-40. However, those six teams are a combined 12-30. \n\"Our guys have been chomping at the bit for a big game because nobody gives us any credit,\" Becahi coach Joe Henrich said. \"They look at our schedule and say 'you're not playing this team' and 'you're not playing that team,' and so we'll see. This is the week it's on the table. We're playing for a division championship. This is exactly what you want in the game of football.\" \nBecahi is not only 6-1 overall, 6-0 in the EPC North, but also No. 2 in the new District 11 3A power rankings. The Golden Hawks have won the last two 3A crowns. \nAfter Stroudsburg, Becahi faces Allen and closes out the regular season against Central Catholic in a game that figures to have district ramifications. \nHenrich said a quality team adapts to any kind of situation and felt his team wasn't bothered by the early start time that was caused by the addition of District 11 soccer tournament games to the busy BASD Stadium schedule. \n\"We've got to be able to play anywhere, at any time, and against anybody,\" Henrich said. \"You have to develop that mentality in your kids. You can't allow them to become creatures of habit. When you get to the playoffs, you never know when you're going to be playing â€¦ Friday or Saturday, day or night. You have to be ready to roll with it.\" \nPocono East coach Mike Culkin said the early start was not good for his kids, many of whom had to get up in the wee hours of the morning just to get to the Swiftwater campus for the ride down to Bethlehem. \nHowever, Culkin wasn't going to use that as an excuse for his 2-5 team. \n\"Becahi's very good, but we made too many mistakes,\" he said. \"You can't start the game snapping the ball over the punter's head and giving them the ball at the 6. We made too mental errors and against a team like that, you can't give them anything. They're a good team with athletes. But in my opinion, we gave them way too much and the score shouldn't have been what it was.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:13:44.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
