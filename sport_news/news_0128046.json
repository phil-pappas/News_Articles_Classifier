But the changes underway in metro Denver appear to be going beyond the normal seasonal changing of colors.\n\"Sellers are starting to chase the market down,\" said Anthony Rael, chairman of the market trends committee with the Denver Metro Association of Realtors.\nIn September, 4,960 homes and condos sold across 11 counties â€” 8 percent fewer than in August., the DMAR market trends report shows.\nThe median price of a single-family home sold stood at $340,000, down 1.65 percent from August's median sold price and off the June peak of $360,500, according to the report.\nThe median price of a condo sold was $211,000 in September, down from June's peak price of $216,000 and off 1.86 percent from August's median.\nRael said he is noticing more homes in the $500,000 and $600,000 range coming down substantially from the original list price after spending weeks on the market. Of two dozen listings in that price range he recently reviewed for a client, about 20 had dropped their prices.\nLower-priced homes are still moving quickly, but not at the frenzied pace seen from February to June, when multiple bids with waived contingencies above list price were common.\nA larger inventory of homes for sale, price drops and lower mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve didn't tighten last month are all working in favor of buyers, Rael said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:05:16.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
