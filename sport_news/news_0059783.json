Leonard Fournette, he’s not, but the 5-9, 190-pound Lamar junior is nearing the 1,000-yard season mark with 833 in five games. \nHe leads the FCS with 166.7 yards rushing per game. \n“Gosh, he is fun to watch run the football,” Northwestern State coach Jay Thomas said, “until he’s running against you. What a great player. Love the way he gets yards after contact, and he doesn’t turn the ball over. They put him running the wildcat last week and he looks like he’s been doing it since junior high.” \nIt seems a daunting task to defend Harrington and what Thomas calls “a big, very talented offensive line,” especially considering run defense has been the Achilles’ heel for the Demons. NSU was gashed for 438 yards on the ground in the season and conference opener by Southeastern Louisiana, and while the damage has been contained to some degree in the last two games against Southland foes Central Arkansas and Incarnate Word (who combined to average 244 yards rushing), the Demons are aiming for more significant improvement. \n“We haven’t defended the run well yet, although I think we’re getting better. No doubt this is a big challenge for us,” said Thomas. “We came in with nine new faces on defense, and at times we’ve been able to defend the run game, but we haven’t been consistent. I think our guys have learned a lot in the school of hard knocks, and I’m anxious to see how we carry that over to Saturday night.” \nThe Demons have shown resiliency in the face of their frustrating 0-5 start. \n“Our guys are in a good frame of mind. We had spirited practices last week, and coming out of the open weekend, had a great workout Sunday night. I think our guys are rejuvenated,” said Thomas. “We have a lot of youth on the team and they’ve bought into the process. Even though we’ve had some hard times, they’ve all hung in there. Our seniors have done a good job of holding things together and I’m really hoping that the effort and passion these young men bring every day will get rewarded.” \nNSU carried the lead into the fourth quarter at UIW two weeks ago, so being tantalizingly close to victory is a motivating factor, he said. \n“Our guys need to come in and compete for four quarters. That’s something we haven’t done well yet. Hopefully this open date helps us clean up our mistakes and we can make this a four-quarter battle,” said Thomas. “It’s an opportunity to play at home, play our homecoming game in Turpin Stadium, and have the great support from our students and fans and be inspired by that.” \nThe Demons and Cardinals (3-2 overall, 2-1 in the Southland) didn’t play last season. NSU has taken the first three meetings (2011-13) in the series since Lamar resumed football last decade. \n“It’s very impressive to see the progress they’ve made since we lined up against them last time,” said Thomas. “They were playing a lot of younger guys and now their experience is one of the things they have going for them.” 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/sports/2015/10/14/nsu-faces-challenge-stopping-lamars-harrington/73912922/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:05:56.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
