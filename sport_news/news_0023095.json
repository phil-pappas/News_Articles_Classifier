In the second, we were able to give the offense more reps and it was hard to get any rhythm. \n“Scoring on the opening drive in the second half really set the tone for us, and I was glad we were able to come out with the victory. We lead the Valley in defense so I knew we were going to come to play, but they drove the ball on us, though, and they did a tremendous job tonight.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:59:04.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
