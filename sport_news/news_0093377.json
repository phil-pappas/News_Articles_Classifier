Edwin Encarnacion had walked with the bases loaded against Edinson Volquez, who seemed flustered by close calls against the Royals. \nEstrada faced the minimum 20 batters before Lorenzo Cain walked with two outs in the sixth. Closer Roberto Osuna was perfect in the ninth. \nToronto forced the series back to Kansas City, where Yordano Ventura will start for the defending AL champions on Friday against David Price. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:19:46.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
