It was just the latest in a long line of moves for the 25-year-old defensive lineman. “I got a little of a past, right?” the personable Hicks said Monday after participating in his first practice with the Patriots. “I’ve been around. … It was a process, but I’m happy with where I’m at now.” Hicks was acquired from the Saints, who drafted him in the third round in 2012, in exchange for tight end Michael Hoomanawanui on Wednesday. The Patriots officially announced the deal the next day. Hicks’ football journey also includes stops at Sacramento Community College in his California hometown, LSU -- which he attended, but didn’t play football at after being ruled ineligible due to recruiting violations -- and the University of Regina (Go you Rams!) in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It was his love of the game that motivated him during a four-year trek on a meandering and uncommon path to the NFL. “I wanted to be as big as a player as I could be,” Hicks said. “I just stayed humble and focused on that.” Hicks is plenty big, checking in at 6-foot-5 and 324 pounds. He also brings a wealth of experience to a unit that was already one of the deepest in the league with veterans Chandler Jones, Rob Ninkovich, Sealver Siliga, Alan Branch and Jabaal Sheard; sophomore Dominique Easley and rookie first-round pick Malcom Brown. Where Hicks fits in remains to be seen. “Well, we’ll see how it goes with him here,” coach Bill Belichick said Sunday. “He played some different spots at New Orleans, from anywhere from the center out to the five-technique. So, we’ll see how that goes here. “But, [he’s a] big guy, physical player. We got a good look at him down there [during joint practices with the Saints in August] and thought that he did some good things. So, we’ll just put him into it here and see how it goes.” Hoomanawanui was inactive for the Patriots’ final game before their bye week after falling behind Rob Gronkowski, Scott Chandler and Michael Williams on the depth chart. The Saints were in need of a tight end and in return were willing to part with a player who had taken on a secondary role this season after being a starter the past three years. Page 2 of 2 - “For me, it’s really all about moving forward and getting into my new team and focusing on what I have to do here,” Hicks said when asked about his situation with the Saints. “It’s always a positive when a team welcomes you into their building with open arms,” he later added. “I definitely take it as a positive and I look forward to my time here.” Hicks appeared in 14 games as a rookie and then started 31 of 34 games over the last two-plus seasons before being dealt to the Patriots. He had 56 tackles and 4.5 sacks in his second season and 41 tackles and two sacks last season for the defense-deficient Saints. Hicks, who is in the fourth and final year of his rookie deal, has two tackles and no sacks this season. He wasn’t making any predictions about returning to his disruptive ways, which surely sat well with his new boss. The goal for now is to become acclimated as quickly as possible with the Patriots’ hybrid, game-plan defense. “I definitely want to be as physical as I have in the past, but I just look forward to playing in this new scheme,” Hicks said. “I don’t have a hold on it yet, but I look forward to what I’ll learn as the year goes on. “I can’t say it’s much of a challenge, but it’s a process,” he went on to explain. “You can’t take everything in in one day, and I look forward to how we get me involved.” By RICH GARVEN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:03:31.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
