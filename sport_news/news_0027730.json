Michigan linebacker Desmond Morgan came lunging in at Cook as he slid to the ground, and Bolden — who was engaged with Michigan State lineman Jack Conklin — came down on top of Cook.\nThe play was reviewed, and Bolden was ejected.\nNo. 12 Michigan played the first half without linebacker James Ross, who was ejected last weekend against Northwestern.\nThe seventh-ranked Spartans scored two plays after Bolden's ejection, the first points allowed by Michigan since Sept. 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:55:43.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
