Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr gives instructions to his payers against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first quarter of Game 6 of the NBA Finals at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday, June 16, 2015. (Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) (RAY CHAVEZ) \n\"And because I'm still having symptoms, it makes it difficult for me to be on the floor. And so the prospects are good. I'm going to heal. The doctor says everybody's body is different. It's a matter of your body sort of recalibrating. And unfortunately, it's not like a sprained ankle, one to two weeks. There's no telling. It's a little bit open-ended, but everybody's very confident everything will be fine.\" \nKerr said surgery to repair a ruptured disk in July led to an accidental nick of the dura, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It took about a month to learn why he was experiencing symptoms -- headaches being the main one. After the second surgery, he lasted two days of training camp before deciding to go on a leave.

He has attended some practices for part of the time, completely missed others and reviewed game tape of the Warriors' preseason action. He said he was perhaps \"over-reading\" on his health situation. \n\"It's no fun,\" Kerr said. \"I want to be here. This is my dream job. These are my guys coming off a title, the season starts in two weeks, it's unbelievably frustrating. I want to be here, but I also know I've got to be careful. But when I'm at home, I'm bored. So, it's tricky.\" \nKerr said he has not questioned his long-term future as a coach going through the grind of an NBA schedule. \n\"I'm 50 years old,\" he said. \"I'm in good shape. I'm in good overall health. This is a unique circumstance, and once it's resolved, I'll be fine.\" \nKerr said he wanted to be upfront with fans and media members about his condition after declining an interview request Friday while attending the Cal volleyball match. \n\"I'm not going to put a timetable on when I'm going to come back,\" Kerr said. \"I have to get my health right before I can coach the team, before I can bring the energy that's necessary to coach the team. \n\"When you are forced to be away, it hurts.\" \nWarriors first-round draft pick Kevon Looney is no longer on crutches after undergoing right hip surgery in August, but he is unsure when he'll resume basketball activities after it was announced he would miss at least four to six months. \nLoony is scheduled for a follow-up visit to his surgeon this week and in the meantime has been watching practices, doing rehab work and shooting without jumping. \n\"The process is slow, but it's going good,\" Loony said. \nLoony said he was also going through a diet regimen similar to what Draymond Green is doing. \n\"I guess what he does is no carbs, no sugar,\" Loony said. \"I don't know the specifics. He tells me what not to eat, so I'm not eating it.\" \nLoony was also among the players who met with President Barack Obama at an event in San Francisco on Saturday, joining Green, Stephen Curry, Harrison Barnes, Jason Thompson, Chris Babb and Ian Clark.
