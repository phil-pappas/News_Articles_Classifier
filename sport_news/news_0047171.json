It's the motive behind those hits that makes the hip-hop pioneers special; their sexually charged songs served a greater purpose than mere shock value. Through their music, the Queens, N.Y., duo changed how women were presented in hip hop.\nUntil Salt-N-Pepa came around, a woman's place in rap culture was solely as a video vixen, there to be objectified and lusted after by the star of the moment. By stepping into the spotlight and claiming their sexuality as their own, Salt-N-Pepa created their own legacy.\n\"It's hard for me to wrap my brain around that, being called an icon,\" says Salt, otherwise known as 49-year-old Cheryl James. \"There's Cheryl the mom, the friend, the life coach... and then there's Salt, the superstar who puts on her weave and her bling-bling and gets up there and does her thing. I'm separate from that person, so it's humbling for Cheryl for sure. I haven't integrated yet, Cheryl and Salt; I'm still trying.\n\"Pepa is Pepa, all day, every day, onstage, off-stage, there's no Sandra and Pepa. Pepa is Pepa,\" James says with a laugh.\nJames and Sandra Denton, 50, formed Salt-N-Pepa in 1985 (adding DJ Spinderella, a.k.a. Deirdra Roper, in 1986), and were one of the first all-female hip-hop groups to make it in the music business.\n\"I was in college; I didn't know what I was going to do with my life,\" James recalls. \"I was really depressed. I had no direction, I had no plan, I had, in my mind, no talent or skills or passion for anything. So I was in that 'Where do I go from here?' place, and really worried, as are a lot of college students are going in and coming out of college.\n\"But when we started this and I got on the mike, I was like, 'This is it. There's no plan B, there's nothing else that I want to do. This is a do-or-die situation.'\n\"I also knew somewhere in my gut that this was gonna be big; it was just inner knowing. And that was the driving force behind my persistence and my hunger to make Salt-N-Pepa happen.\"\nTheir first album, Hot, Cool & Vicious, was released in 1986 and contained the song Push It as a B-side. The remix of Push It became one of the group's most successful recordings.\nAfter releasing five albums, collecting five Grammy Awards and touring non-stop, the pace and pressure began to take its toll on the group. In 2002, James decided she wanted a life away from the music business and the trio disbanded.\nSalt-N-Pepa reunited in 2007 and, after a couple of bouts with reality TV, went back on the road in 2011. They've been touring and doing spot shows and appearances ever since, and James says this time, things feel a lot different than they used to.\n\"We've gone through a lot as a group -- we've gone through a lot in our relationships, a lot of breakups and divorce -- and I think at this particular time in our lives, we've finally come to a place when we've decided to choose us first and to really be in pursuit of joy,\" she says. \"We laugh a lot and have a lot of fun, and we don't take things as seriously as we used to.\"\nJames and Denton have had a rocky relationship, but James says the two are in a good place now.\n\"It's a long-lasting friendship... Pep and I were best friends when we started, so we know each other on that level,\" James says. \"Men come and go, people come and go, but this is like a marriage, so you have to grow in a close relationship with someone that you cannot escape from.\n\"We have to be together -- we created this legacy and people love us and they want us and it's a blessing to be able to still do it -- so it forces her and I to grow as human beings, to learn how to communicate, to learn how to give and take, to learn how to stand in one another's shoes and compromise when compromises need to be made. This is the one relationship in my life that I feel has stretched me the most.\"\nJames laughs when asked if she thought she'd still be performing nearly 30 years after the group started out.\n\"Definitely didn't think I'd still be onstage by now. I used to say that to Pep... 'I don't want to be in my 40s onstage, shaking my thing,' \" James chuckles. \"Pep's always been like 'I'll be like Tina Turner -- I'll go till 70.' But you never know. Life is funny. You can make plans, but then life just takes its own course sometimes and you just go with the flow and I'm really having a good time.\n\"We're very humble, so we don't take for granted that after 30 years we can still put a show up and sell it out in a day... that's just a blessing, an unexpected blessing to us.\"\nerin.lebar@freepress.mb.ca Twitter: @NireRabel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:09:55.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
