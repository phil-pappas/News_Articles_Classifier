Unlike much of his career in Boston, he was not out on the floor to begin the game. Throughout the first quarter against Olimpia Milano, the fourth-year forward heard another name called and watched another big body pass him on the way to the scorer’s table. Finally, a little less than two minutes into the second quarter, Sullinger got the call as the fifth big man in the Celtics rotation. He responded with 14 points, on 7-of-10 shooting, with four rebounds in a little more than 15 minutes on the night. What could have been a confidence breaker, he says, was anything but as he attempted to show he deserves time in a crowded frontcourt rotation that includes starters David Lee and Tyler Zeller, and reserves Amir Johnson and Kelly Olynyk. “I just think, overall, it helps our basketball team when you’ve got competition like that,” said Sullinger, who then scored seven points with six rebounds in 11 minutes off the bench Thursday against Real Madrid in Spain. “All five guys have been starters in this league — from me, to D-Lee, to Tyler, to Kelly, to Amir. “That’s a big challenge to tell somebody who is so used to starting that ‘Hey, you’re coming off the bench,’ or ‘Hey, you’re not playing tonight.’” If it’s in the best interest of the team, at the same time, we’ve got to accept that. If you’re the guy on the bench, or if you’re the guy who is starting, you’ve got to play that role.” While being the fifth man in that pecking order might be a recipe for a lot of nights where you don’t necessarily need to shower before changing out of the uniform and heading home, Sullinger has seen enough life under third-year coach Brad Stevens to know better on this team. Stevens routinely went 11 or 12 players deep into his rotation even into the playoffs last season, and indications are that will not change with even more worthy candidates for playing time at the far reaches of the bench this season. “A reporter asked me after the second game, ‘What is the strength of this Celtics team this year?’” Celtics newcomer David Lee said following Sunday’s shooting session in Waltham. “I kind of had to think about it for a minute. But the answer is: ‘Depth.’” Page 2 of 2 - “We’re, legit, two — sometimes three — deep at every position. If we can use that to our advantage by everybody playing at a feverish pace, and challenging one another, and when you’re ready to slow down a little bit put your hand up and the next guy comes and continues where you left off, that can be an advantage against other teams that aren’t going to play as many guys.” Stevens said on Sunday he already has a general idea of which players he likes out on the court with whom. But one thing he’s made clear early on is that he wants those combinations pushing each other at all times, not conserving energy. “I just have to be in unbelievable shape,” Lee said. “Talking to the guys in that first unit, if we can all be in tip-top shape, and can play at a certain pace for eight or nine minutes, that stuff is very tough to guard.” Amir Johnson, who returned to practice on Sunday after missing the final game in Europe with a virus that swept through the squad, said he saw some of the same things in his 16 minutes on the floor against Olimpia Milano and while watching against Real Madrid. “We always move the ball,” he said. “We don’t want 40 dribbles from the guard coming down. We want either a swing pass or a drive. The coaches are constantly teaching us going through the offense to move the ball. Once the ball moves side to side, it makes it an easier shot for us.” Sullinger said he understands those shots will go to different guys each night, but points — as well as playing time — will be there if everyone remains committed to the program and prepared to answer the call when it comes. “I am not here to make it a rivalry between me, Amir, Tyler, Kelly, Jonas (Jerebko) or D-Lee. My biggest thing is I just want us to win. If that means me cutting back my minutes … (winning) is the ultimate goal. “You never know what is going to happen. You’ve got to stay ready.” By Scott Souza More Content Now The Bulletin By Scott Souza More Content Now Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 9:03 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:22:00.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
