Sophomore backup quarterback Joel Lanning threw one pass Saturday against TCU and it went for a 74-yard touchdown to Allen Lazard. By LUKE MEREDITH AP Sports Writer \nAMES (AP) — Iowa State is keeping Sam Richardson at quarterback — and the Cyclones plan to give backup Joel Lanning more snaps moving forward, too. \nCoach Paul Rhoads said Monday that Lanning, a redshirt sophomore, will play a bigger role starting with Saturday’s game at No. 2 Baylor (6-0, 3-0 Big 12). \nLanning threw just one pass in last week’s loss against No. 4 TCU and it went for a 74-yard touchdown. But Richardson’s experience is a big reason why Rhoads and offensive coordinator Mark Mangino are sticking with the senior. \nRichardson has thrown just one touchdown pass over the past two games, which Iowa State (2-4, 1-2) lost by an average of nearly 30 points. \n“He’s a fifth-year player that thoroughly understands our offense, and that thorough understanding is a big part of it,” Rhoads said. “If you don’t have that mental piece in place as strong as it needs to be, it can be catastrophic.” \nRichardson’s overall numbers — more than 1,400 yards on 62.3 percent passing through six games — look decent on paper. But the Cyclones are not winning many games. \nWith Richardson behind center against No. 12 Iowa last month, the Cyclones failed to score in the second half and Richardson’s late interception closed the door on a comeback. Richardson’s best game came against winless Kansas, and his eight touchdown passes are the fewest among Big 12 quarterbacks with at least 150 attempts. \nRhoads defended Richardson again Monday, stating Iowa State’s tough schedule as part of the reason Richardson’s numbers have been lagging. \n“Three teams (we’ve played) are undefeated. The other team’s only losses are to the No. 2- and No. 3-ranked teams in the country. You have a different schedule, and we’re 4-2 or 5-1, and Sam is playing at the same level, people aren’t asking that question,” Rhoads said. \nLanning’s big arm, quick feet and flashes of brilliance in limited duty have made him a popular figure among Cyclones fans. Lanning grew up in nearby Ankeny, just 20 minutes from Jack Trice Stadium. He turned down an offer from Nebraska — a school that has historically snatched up just about every recruit Iowa State also wanted — after being named the Class 4A Player of the Year as a senior. \nLanning never threw a pass during his first two years on campus. But the coaching staff raved about Lanning’s improvement during the offseason, even devising a package for Lanning simply so they could get him on the field. \nRhoads is a big supporter of Lanning, too. But he’s not ready to make Lanning the starter just yet. \n“Joel is as competitive as heck. There are some things he does really well. There are some things that he’s still learning,” Rhoads said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:10:29.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
