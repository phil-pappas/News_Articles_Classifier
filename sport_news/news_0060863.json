(AP) - A probable cause hearing has been postponed in the case of a former school employee and football coach charged with sexually assaulting a student and making child pornography.\nThirty-year-old Donald Levesque of Concord previously worked as an assistant at Shaker Road School and as a coach with the Concord Capitals football program. He is accused of assaulting a 13-year-old student and was supposed to face a hearing Friday, but The Concord Monitor reports ( http://bit.ly/1OpwgGn ) both are now scheduled for Oct. 22.\nAuthorities say the incidents occurred in 2013 and 2014 off school grounds. Levesque is charged with felonious sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child and manufacturing child sexual abuse images. He's being held on $60,000 bail.\nOfficials say Levesque hasn't been at the school since early 2014.\n=\nThis story has been corrected to show that Levesque worked as an assistant, not a teacher, at Shaker Road School.\nInformation from: Concord Monitor, http://www.cmonitor.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1OpwgGn"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:55:41.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
