Keep Ticker running of final score during Sunday and Monday games. Maybe include some updates of injuries on noted players from around the League Insider like Schefter could be used here. 46 man roster 2 Cut Down Days during Pre-Season, First one after the 3rd game, the second one after the Final Pre-Season Game. 10 man Practice Squad (rules on adding a player from your PS & another teams. Being Notified that a player is being targeted by another team and given option to sign on to 53 or let the other team sign the player.) Note: Players on a team PS should have increase knowledge of the teams playbook from a player on the street, this will allow the player a better chance of stepping in and contributing. Realistic Injuries (Wear & Tear Injury System) & having to list players as Out, Doubtful, Questionable, Probable Injuries Must carryover into the following Season. Medical/Trainers keep updated on Players Off-Season Surgeries and Rehab. (A player who tears an ACL during final games off the Season, is still rehabbing that injury during the off-season, during Pre-Season & might miss the start of the new season.) More wide range of injuries and nagging injuries. Pulls, strains, tears, sprains (like the high ankle sprain, which can keep a player out for weeks and affect that player all year) Lisfranc injury Important! Injuries during practice. (allow this to be turned off/on, as some don't want this, but adds realism) The P.U.P List. The ability to place players on the pup list, giving them another 6 weeks during the season to get back their playing health. If it's determined they can play after 6 weeks, a 2 week roster exemption is given. If it's determined that the player is not healthy yet, then he can be placed on Season ending I.R. Full Coaching Staff w/ability to re-sign/fire & block an Assistant Full Scouting Staff (4-5 scouts) that cover the Nation. Each Scout is different & have their strengths and weaknesses. The info they provide is the info your Draft board is based upon. You have the ability to hire and fire Scouts after the Draft. Presentation: Keep improving Presentation and Commentary that carryover from Season to Season. Recognition of Super Bowl winning team from the previous season is a start Pre-Season, Reg. Season, Playoffs, Super Bowl need ALL New Audio Individual Team Records (Season, Post-Season, Career) Each Teams Championship Banners in Stadium. New ones won during Franchise Mode are put up in Stadium. Hall Of Fame All New Draft Presentation. Biggest Event in the Off-Season. It's about time the Draft becomes a priority. Injuries discussed during Pre-Game, Halftime, Post Game. A BIG part of the game. Off-Season Weekly updates/recap show OR Just noted Breaking News. Situational Subs without having to reset them during the game or prior to playing the game. (PS2 version had this...) Remove Dynamic Drive Goals in Franchise Mode (OR allow DDG to be turned on/off) - Football is a team sport, never have I seen a Offensive drive built around getting a specific player personal stat goals. Customization is key, Give us the whole NFL experience & who ever doesn't like it allow them to turn some off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:57:39.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
