John Marks jmarks@fortmilltimes.com i Order Reprint of this Story \nBrian Liu picked up a trumpet because he thought it would be easiest. There’s nothing easy about what he’s done with it since. \nLiu, a senior at Nation Ford High School, was named Thursday as the school’s latest U.S. Army All-American Marching Band member. Liu is the 10th member from Nation Ford in the program’s history. Only 125 members make the band each year. \n“I’m really excited about what’s to come,” Liu said. “I’ve heard about this great opportunity from previous alumni that have really enjoyed the opportunity.” \nThe band gets a week of practice together ahead of its Jan. 9 performance in San Antonio, Texas during halftime of the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. Liu said meeting and working with those musicians will be his highlight. \n“Working with the best of the best students around the country,” he said. \nMartin Dickey, band director at Nation Ford, began working with the All-American Band back when he still taught at Fort Mill High School. Several times, including Thursday, he’s been invited to participate with the band. Dickey said the All-American event is more than just another feather in the cap of selected students. \n“They are the largest employer of musicians worldwide,” Dickey said of the Army. “It’s a great opportunity.” \nHaving spent time on staff with the band and even evaluating auditions, Dickey knows how to guide students looking to participate. Still, few make it. Applications include three introduction and performance videos. Students who make the band, Dickey said, earn it. \n“It’s an incredible experience,” Dickey said. “He’ll have a lot of fun.” \nLiu hopes the trip and performance will lead to bigger moments in music. A far cry from his earliest days, when he picked the trumpet simply because he thought he could learn in easiest. \n“I hope this experience will expand my horizons as a musician,” Liu said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:30:12.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
