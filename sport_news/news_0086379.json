But inside the Chiefs Chapel tent, it is a much different scene. It is a place where fans can come and worship before every noon home game.\n\"We're just trying to match the enthusiasm by having a church service here at Arrowhead,\" said Marcellus Casey, director of Kansas City’s Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\nTwo years ago, Kansas City’s FCA partnered with the Chiefs to offer the non-denominational service. It gives die-hard fans the chance to attend the game, without having to missing their Sunday devotional.\n\"A lot of times, you'll see or someone will say, 'Hey I was here last year for one or two,' and thanks for putting these on,\" chapel volunteer Jeremy McTaggert said.\nChiefs chaplain Phillip Kelley leads the services which include plenty of music and a guest speaker. Inside the chapel, the rivalries are put aside, even if it’s just for 45 minutes.\n\"Everybody’s welcome,\" McTaggert said.\nAnd Sunday, Steelers fans are invited too. All services begin at 9:30 a.m. and last until about 10:15 a.m. - just enough time to grill some burgers and brats before kickoff.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
