Yakupov finished with a career high 19 assists and 33 points last year, primarily playing as a second or third-line player. The injury could also mean a bigger role for Leon Draisaitl at the beginning of the year.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://oilers.nhl.com/club/blogpost.htm?id=41585"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:03:23.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
