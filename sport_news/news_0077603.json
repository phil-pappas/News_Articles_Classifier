Live Stream \nWith the MLB postseason moving to national broadcasts, it's easier to get ahead of an online broadcast. Even the official MLB option is more reasonable. \nMLB.tv Postseason Package - A package from the league that lets you catch postseason games streaming on your computer and other devices. May not include all ALCS/NLCS games. \nFox Sports Go (or Fox Sports Go mobile app ) - Fox carries a pretty good streaming service for national games -- free for cable subscribers. \n--- \nThe Astros head into Thursday's game just a couple night's removed from the Wild Card Game win over the New York Yankees. Houston advanced to the next round after a dominant pitching performance over their wild card foe. However, they had to send ace Dallas Keuchel to the mound in the process. \nThe Rangers, meanwhile, will be fresh heading into the series against an Astros team that just came off an emotional win -- all of which is coming on the road. \nThe Astros will send Collin McHugh to the mound to open the series in Kansas City. The Royals will counter with 24-year-old Yordano Ventura, who takes the nod over Johnny Cueto, who has under-performed since he was acquired from the Cincinnati Reds at the trade deadline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:09:52.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
