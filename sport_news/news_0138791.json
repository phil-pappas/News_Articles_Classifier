The latest from SportsLine Pete's Best Bets: Five home teams to back A detective from the LAPD's West Valley Division told USA Today that four armed suspects broke in to Jackson's home sometime early Wednesday morning. There were five people in Jackson's house at the time of the robbery and one of them was injured while trying to fend off the robbers.\nAccording to TMZ.com , the injured inhabitant of the house was pistol-whipped by one of the intruders. \nJackson has yet to comment on the incident, but Redskins coach Jay Gruden did mention it on Friday. \n\"He'll get to the bottom of it, as will the police, and we'll go from there,\" Gruden said.\nJackson, who hasn't played since Week 1 due to a hamstring injury, was in Virginia at the time of Wednesday's incident. \nThe robbery at Jackson's LA home marks the second time in 20 months that one of his residences has been robbed . Back in January 2014, several thieves made off with over $250,000 in cash after robbing a home in Philadelphia that belonged to Jackson. An LA house belonging to DeSean Jackson was robbed this week.
