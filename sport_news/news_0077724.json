Having said this, my time for 100m in Berlin was the worst in my career. I didn’t get my act together. I am sure that everything will be different in Doha,” he said. “I prepare for competitions on my own, without a psychologist,” explained Shvetcov. “I think that the most important thing is not to be afraid or intimidated by your competitors.”\nThe reigning world 100m, 200m and 400m T36 champion aims to defend all three of his 2013 titles in Doha and maintain his winning ways at major competitions, having clinched a hat trick of individual gold medals at both the London 2012 Paralympic Games and then at the IPC Athletics European Championships in Swansea, Great Britain last year.\nShvetcov took gold in the 100m, 400m and 800m T36 in London but now with his focus firmly on the sprints and a training block with the Russian national team in Sochi under his belt, the world number one believes he is best placed to reign supreme yet again.\n “After London we decided to change the training course. Instead of training for all events, we are narrowing it down to shorter distances, including my favorite one, 400m. I like this event the best because this is where your speed endurance is the most important,” he added.\nOf course speed endurance should come naturally to the Mordovia-born athlete, who began his sporting career on the football pitch.\nThe multiple world record holder still does not miss a chance to watch a football match on television and is a loyal fan of the Saint Petersburg-based Zenit team.\nBut any plans to follow his team’s exploits on his laptop whilst he is in Doha will still not detract from the matter in hand.\nGreat Britain’s Paul Blake will take on Shvetcov over 400m, having finished second behind the Russian over one lap in Lyon, France, two years ago and again in Wales at the 2014 European Championships.\nThe Briton is quick to admit that beating the Russian will be a challenge – but it is a challenge he has been preparing hard for.\n“It obviously spurs him on to see me there as well,” said Blake.\n“He is a really tough competitor and I’m still striving to beat him, but he is a phenomenal athlete. It is good to see that we have built up a rivalry over the years.\n“He’ll be training just as hard as I am. It is what motivates me to work hard every day – I want to win the gold.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:14:13.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
