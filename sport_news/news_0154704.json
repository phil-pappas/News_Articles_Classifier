They get to play the Nationals and get introduced at Citi Field as National League East champions for the first time. \nBut there's more to it than that. The Mets actually have a few things they need to be assured of this weekend as they try to recover from a sweep at the hands of the Phillies. \nWith that, here are six reasons why this series still has important for the Mets. Some are more important than others, but they all matter. RELATED: Is 42-year-old Mets pitcher Bartolo Colon going to play a 19th season? \n1. Stay healthy. This is the most important thing. The Mets need to leave this weekend healthy and upright. That's been an issue lately (See: Yoenis Cespedes, Steven Matz, Juan Uribe , Wilmer Flores). They'll see how those guys come through into next weekend and hope they don't have to add anyone else to the list. \n2. Get home-field. It's not critical but it would be a marginal advantage. Sure, the Mets are 48-30 at Citi Field and 41-40 away from it, but the playoffs are just a crap shoot. It probably doesn't matter to Clayton Kershaw where he pitches. \n3. Make sure the pitching is OK. Noah Syndergaard, Matt Harvey and Jacob deGrom are scheduled to pitch this weekend — in that order. If they look as good as they did last weekend against the Reds, the Mets should be just fine heading into the postseason. \n4. See if Steven Matz can pitch in the playoffs. He was scratched from his start this week because of a bad back . The Mets hope they can pitch him at some point this weekend, likely for a starter's load of innings in relief. If he can come through it healthy and in form, he's still the likely pick to pitch Game 4 in the NLDS. \n5. Put the stake in the Nationals. Washington has tormented and battered the Mets enough over the previous few years where it's OK to take some joy in ending a bitterly disappointing season with another blow. \n6. Stay healthy. This bears repeating. See above. \nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @Mike_Vorkunov .
