Michael Goulding / The Orange County Register via AP By Bruce Feldman Oct 23, 2015 at 4:18a ET PASADENA, Calif. 0Shares \nThe matchup between arguably the two most gifted quarterback prospects in college football turned into a rout Thursday night. Host UCLA whipped No. 20 Cal, 40-24 in a game that didn’t feel that close as true freshman QB Josh Rosen set a school-record with 34 completions while throwing for 399 yards and three TDs for the Bruins. His counterpart, Cal junior Jared Goff , went 32 of 53 for 295 yards and also threw three TDs. Neither QB was picked off, but one of the big differences was Rosen was sacked just once. Goff was taken down five times. \n“We got pressure on Rosen, but we didn’t do a good job of keeping him hemmed in,” Cal coach Sonny Dykes said. “Things we haven’t done all year, we did tonight.” \nRosen evaded rushers with his deft footwork ( which we profiled in this feature on FS1 ) and made some eye-popping touch throws, torching the Bears D, which came into the game No. 1 in the nation in turnovers gained. Before the third quarter was done, Rosen had gone 33 of 46 for 391 yards and three TDs. true \nUCLA defensive coordinator Tom Bradley also credited Rosen's back-up, Jerry Neuheisel , for helping focus his teammates' pass rush in the days getting ready for Goff. The Bruins relied on lots of four-man pressure and a variety of line stunts. “You have to be so disciplined in your pass rush,” Bradley said, in reference to Goff’s ability to move around the pocket. “Thanks to Jerry we got better this week.” \nHead coach Jim Mora praised his 18-year-old quarterback and said Rosen is a lot like Goff. “He’s very mature,” Mora said. “He has tremendous poise. He prepares well and he’s smart. He trusts the guys around him. He trusts his receivers. And, like all great performers, they are able to let go of what just happened and move on to the next event. Josh has been able to do that now for seven games, in spring ball and in our summer camp. He’s a rare kid, just like Goff. They’re both very good quarterbacks.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:21:58.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
