Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 10:07 pm Talladega County Central in must-win mode By LAVONTE YOUNG, Home sports editor Annistonstar.com To say each game is a must-win for Talladega County Central is an understatement. The Fighting Tigers have two region high school football games remaining, and they need to win both to secure a playoff berth. The first of those tests arrives on Friday as head coach Chris Mahand’s team plays host to Appalachian at 7 at Alumni Stadium in Howell’s Cove. “Each game is critical. We only have two region games remaining,” Mahand said. “It is pretty much about the playoff race and getting into the playoff now. “You will be blessed to go to the playoffs at any seed, but if you can help it, you definitely don’t want to be the fourth seed and face the No. 1 seed in the region that you are facing. Getting into the playoffs is great, but we are trying to battle for our seeding now.” For the second year in a row, TC Central has started the second half of the season on a roll. The Fighting Tigers are on a two-game winning streak that includes a 32-14 victory over Spring Garden and a 30-14 victory over Ragland last week. “The guys are starting to pull it together, and they are finally executing the game plan that the coaches put in,” Mahand said. “We have always had the talent, we knew that, the kids knew that and the community knew that.” Mahand said he has had several players step up the last couple of weeks. He said he will need those players to continue their strong play if TCC is going to finish the season strong. “Offensively, the last two games, Kylen Cross has stepped up,” the coach said. “He has over 600 yards and five touchdowns in the last two games. He has also had over 20 tackles in the last two games. “Jamari Evans, offensively and defensively, has stepped up also. “We are going to lean on those two guys for the rest of the season because they have upped their play. It has been waited on and needed -- they have finally stepped up for me.” The Eagles (1-5, 0-4) are coming off a 37-13 loss to Winterboro last week. Even though Appalachian has struggled, Mahand expect the Eagles to come in ready to play. “Their coach definitely coaches to win,” Mahand said. “He is not coming here thinking that they are going to lose – they think they are going to come here to win. We have to continue to play good football if we expect to have a good game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:17:35.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
