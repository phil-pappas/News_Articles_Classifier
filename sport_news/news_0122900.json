Just a lot of big punches as he dominated his middleweight title fight with Canadian David Lemieux.\nGolovkin battered Lemieux around the ring Saturday night on the big stage at Madison Square Garden, landing punch after punch before the referee mercifully stepped in and stopped the fight in the eighth round. He remained unbeaten in 34 fights, and stopped his opponent for the 21st straight time.\n\nGennady Golovkin, left, hits David Lemieux in the eighth round of a world middleweight title fight at Madison Square Garden in New York on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015.

(AP Photo/Rich Schultz) \nFighting before a sold-out crowd of 20,548 cheering his every move, Golovkin was methodical as he knocked down Lemieux in the fourth round, bloodied his nose and dominated almost every second of the way.\nLemieux, from Montreal, was on the ropes taking punch after punch when Steve Willis finally stepped in at 1:32 of the eighth round to call an end to the fight.\nIt was a coming out party of sorts for Golovkin, who was headling his first pay-per-view fight, and he was at his best as he wore down Lemieux with his relentless punching.\n\"I told you this was a very important fight,\" Golovkin said. \"I give my fans and friends a big show. Thank you my fans. Thank you my people.\"\nWith the crowd chanting \"Triple G! Triple G!\" Golovkin showed why he is the most feared man in the heavyweight division with yet another impressive win against an opponent who was supposed to be his best yet.\nLemieux brought a 160 pound title of his own into the ring, but was no match for Golovkin, the former amateur star from Kazakhstan who now lives in Los Angeles. Lemieux fought gamely, but his punches were mostly wild and he was forced to take punishment in return.\n\"I'll keep my mouth shut tonight,\" said Lemieux, whose face was marked and red. \"But I'll see him in the future.\"\nWith Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump watching from ringside, Golovkin took control of the fight early, with his precise punches finding the mark with regularity. Lemieux seemed tentative, though by the third round he was throwing wild right hands that Golovkin had little trouble avoiding.\nGolovkin (34-0, 31 knockouts) hurt Lemieux with a left hook to the head in the fourth round, then unleashed a series of head shots that backed the Canadian against the ropes. From then it was just a matter of time as Golovkin hunted down Lemieux (34-3), eager to knock him out just like he had his 20 previous opponents.\nThe win put Golovkin in line for a possible megafight next spring against the winner of the Nov. 21 fight between Canelo Alvarez and Miguel Cotto.\n\"He'll be at the fight and he'll be looking to fight the winner,\" promoter Tom Loeffler said. \"Whoever wins that fight will clearly be at the top of the sport as Gennady is himself.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:13:31.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
