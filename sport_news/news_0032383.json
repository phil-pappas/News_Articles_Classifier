But on eight of those totes, the conference’s leading rusher advanced at least nine yards past the line of scrimmage. That one fact alone seemed to capsulize the kind of night it was for the struggling Blue Devils. Vargas ended the evening with 201 yards rushing and tallied touchdown runs of 22, 58, 1 and 44 yards in the Riverhawks’ 36-13 victory. Chiawana improved to 3-2 in the MCC and 4-3 overall. Wa-Hi, which has lost three straight games and four of its last five, is 1-4 and 2-5. Wa-Hi moved the ball from its 31-yard line to the Chiawana 43 on the game’s initial possession. But the march ended on a fumble that the Riverhawks recovered at their 48. Chiawana capitalized on the bobble. Vargas ended a 52-yard, six-play drive with his first score of the game at the 7:30 mark of the opening quarter. The first of four accurate PAT kicks from Matt Winn made it 7-0. The Blue Devils negotiated from their 16 to the Riverhawks’ 32 on their next series, but would relinquish the ball on downs. Chiawana suffered lost fumbles on its second and third possessions. The latter snafu occurred on a first-and-goal play at the Wa-Hi 1. The Riverhawks made amends with 20 points in the second quarter. Vargas’ second and third touchdowns sandwiched around a 35-yard scoring pass from quarterback Troy Simpkins to wide receiver Roman Ruiz. Bryant Romero broke through to block Winn’s third extra-point attempt of the quarter to provide the lone black spot on the Riverhawks’ point spree. Chiawana led 27-0 at halftime. “It was a tough second quarter. I’m not going to lie,” Wa-Hi coach Eric Hisaw said. “The first quarter was not great, but competitive. Then the floodgates opened.” The Riverhawks’ defense registered a safety with 11:17 left in the third quarter and Vargas rumbled for his league-leading 15th touchdown at the 10:57 mark to bring the one-sided score to 36-0. Wa-Hi’s first touchdown was realized with 5:45 remaining in the third. Quarterback Mitch Lesmeister connected with running back Noah Porter for a six-point toss of 15 yards to end an 11-play drive that chewed up 82 yards and five minutes off the clock. “It was a real neat deal for our kids,” Hisaw said. The Blue Devils’ running game, held in check for much of the game, enjoyed a spotlight moment when Sam Hoe busted loose for an 80-yard touchdown with 2:55 to go in the fourth quarter. “That was a total team play,” Hisaw said. “Sam hit the hole at a million miles per hour. “We decided to be more courageous in the second half,” Hisaw said. “It was not a screamfest at halftime. I told the kids, ‘If you’re not going to be physical, you’re going to stand next to me.’ I was proud of how the kids responded — at the skilled positions and in the box. We need to play that way from the first snap.” Wa-Hi hosts Hanford for its final regular-season home game Friday night at Borleske Stadium. “We need to play our best game of the year next week,” Hisaw said. “We owe it to our seniors.” Chiawana 36, Wa-Hi 13 Wa-Hi 0 0 7 6 — 13 Chiawana 7 20 9 0 — 36 Chia — Vargas 22 run (Winn kick).
