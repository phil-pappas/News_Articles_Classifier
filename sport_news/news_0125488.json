Heyward's father, Craig, spent a decade as a running back in the NFL and went by the nickname \"Ironhead\" for his physical style of play. \nPassaic's Craig Heyward died in 2006 following a lengthy battle with cancer. He was 39. \nHeyward tweeted: \"Got fined for honoring my Dad who bravely fought cancer on my eye black. #NeverGiveUp #CancerSucks\" \nAs for practice, QB Ben Roethlisberger was a limited participant for the first time since spraining his left MCL on Sept. 27 vs. the Rams. \nTRACKING EX-GIANTS: Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said the MRI on DE Justin Tuck's injured shoulder is \"not good,\" but declined to reveal further details or discuss whether the former Giants lineman would be put on the IR list. \nTuck has one sack and seven tackles through five games. \nMeanwhile, the Colts re-signed former Giants RB Ahmad Bradshaw, who spent the past two seasons with the team but finished both years on injured reserve. \nPASSING THE TEST? Jaguars QB Blake Bortles fully participated in practice, getting all the starter snaps three days after spraining his throwing shoulder. Bortles said he felt considerably better than he did Monday and gave no reason to keep him on the sideline. … Browns QB Luke McCown, who sprained his left ankle while leading the game-winning drive in overtime to beat the Ravens last week, said he intends to be on the field Sunday vs. the Broncos. He was able to practice Wednesday. \nIN AND OUT: The Falcons said WR Julio Jones (hamstring) was limited at practice and is listed as probable vs. the Saints on Thursday night. … Patriots LT Nate Solder was placed on the IR list, three days after he left the game against the Cowboys with an arm injury. \nAUTOPSY RESULT: Former NFL lineman Adrian Robinson Jr., who killed himself, had a brain disease that has been linked to repeated blows to the head, researchers confirmed. He was 25.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:52:05.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
