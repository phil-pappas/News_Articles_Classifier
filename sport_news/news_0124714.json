A Bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu passed the order on a petition by the Jammu and Kashmir government. The state government had come to the SC following two conflicting orders passed by the HC -- one for enforcement of the ban and another on a plea for lifting the ban. The SC kept the HC order for enforcement of the ban in abeyance for two months. The HC’s Bench at Jammu had asked the state police chief on September 8 to ensure that there was no sale of beef anywhere in the state. It was hearing a writ petition by Parimoksh Seth, pleading for the enforcement of the ban provided under the Ranbir Penal Code (RPC). A week later, a Bench at Srinagar issued notice to the government on September 16 on a plea by another writ petitioner SM Iqbal Qadri for quashing the RPC provision that prohibits slaughter and sale of bovine animals. The HC also clarified that the state government or the Assembly was free to scrap the provision, irrespective of the pending case. In its petition, the state government pleaded with the SC to ensure that there was “uniformity and consistency in judicial pronouncements,” leaving no scope for any confusion and threat to communal harmony, amity and peace in the state. This was necessary to prevent alienation of the people of the state from the national mainstream, it said. Qadri had pleaded that the ban on slaughter of bovine animals “constitutes an unreasonable infringement on his fundamental rights” and as such should be declared as ultra-vires. The state government apprehended that there was a possibility of the two Benches of the HC delivering “mutually contradictory” judgments posing a threat to the prevailing peace in the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:28:05.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
