Madali lang kaming magkaintindihan,” said Arcilla, an eight-time champion in the local PCA tournament.\n“This week, we made sure lang na hindi kami magla-lapse. Basta laro-laro lang. Siguro nagulat lang yung kalaban kasi mabilis kami pareho, especially sa returns,” added Alcantara, 23, who won the Australian Open junior doubles title in 2009.\nAlcantara and Arcilla never dropped a set all throughout the tournament, beating Filipino Jeson Patrombon and Taiwanese Yu Cheng-Yu, 6-2, 6-2; local netters PJ Tierro and Elbert Anasta, 6-4, 6-2; and Japanese pair Soichiro Moritani and Masato Shiga, 6-1, 6-3, in the 16-pair field.\nMeantime, third seed Kento Takeuchi of Japan avenged his Finals loss last week to compatriot Makoto Ochi with a 2-6, 6-0, 6-1 victory yesterday to barge into the final.\nTakeuchi’s win helped him arrange a championship duel against top seed Enrique Lopez-Perez of Spain, who bested No. Arata Onozawa of Japan, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:02:16.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
