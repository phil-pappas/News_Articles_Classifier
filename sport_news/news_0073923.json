We hope for a dry race, but the wind is always strong, so in good conditions this is one of the best tracks of the season but with bad weather it’s very difficult.” \nWith reigning world champion Marc Marquez a long way adrift in third place, the battle for this year’s title is down to the two Yamaha teammates, who have shared a tense rivalry at times. \nLorenzo’s championship aspirations suffered a blow in last week’s Japanese MotoGP when he gave up a big lead in wet conditions to finish third behind winner Dani Pedrosa and Rossi. \nThe Spaniard took the chequered flag at the 2013 Australian MotoGP and knows he must replicate that feat this weekend as the championship race enters its closing stages. \n“A lot has happened this year but now it comes to the final races and we must win if we want to recover those points,” Lorenzo said. \n“I want to have the chance to be world champion – this is the goal that we have – but we aren’t very focused just on the result. We are focused to keep working in the same way that we have been. If we can do that we’re going to be fast and consistent.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:22:26.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
