Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, copyright 2015 A little rain and cloudy skies couldn’t put a damper on a milestone celebration Thursday at Yosemite National Park. \nHundreds gathered outside of the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center to commemorate the 125th anniversary since Congress passed legislation adding Yosemite to the national park system on Oct. 1, 1890. \nAmong the many in attendance was Tuolumne County District 4 Supervisor John Gray, whose family has deep roots in the park. \n“I’ve got a picture in a book that has my grandfather, John Rufus Gray, on Sentinel Bridge at the same time Teddy Roosevelt made his visit (in 1903),” he said. “There’s a long connection with my family.” \nThere’s also a long connection between the park and Tuolumne County in general. \nAlthough officially the third national park to be established by Congress — behind Yellowstone on March 1, 1872 and Sequoia on Sept. 25, 1890 — the protection of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias through President Abraham Lincoln’s signing of the Yosemite Grant Act on June 30, 1864, is considered by many to be what laid the foundation for the national park system as we know it today. \nTuolumne County, established in 1850, was experiencing a mass exodus following a brief boom period during the Gold Rush. Tourism emerged as a major industry for the area following the signing of the Yosemite Grant and, later, the designation as a national park. \nGray’s family purchased a Chinese Camp-area livery stable in 1864 where they rented horses and wagons to people going to see the newly established preserve. His grandfather also served as a guide in the park. \nSince that time, tourism is credited with helping to sustain the economy of the Highway 120 corridor. It’s also the county’s No. 1 industry. \n“If it hadn’t been designated a park, we wouldn’t have the tourism that we have in Tuolumne County or the 120 corridor especially,” Gray said. \nAn average of nearly 4 million people visit the park on an annual basis. According to the National Park Service, visitor spending in gateway communities within 60 miles of the park generated $535 million in 2014. \nOne sign of the ways that the area continues to benefit is the development of the Rush Creek Lodge off Highway 120, a sister property to the Evergreen Lodge outside of Groveland. \nScheduled to open in spring 2016, the 143-room lodge will provide about 100 jobs. Evergreen Lodge assistant general manager Nick Simon said the plan is to hire mostly local people. \nPark tourists have also helped sustain long-running businesses in the corridor following the decline of mining and logging. The Iron Door Saloon in Groveland established in 1852 — the longest continuously operating bar in the state — receives about 75 percent of its yearly revenue mostly from Yosemite visitors between Memorial Day and Labor Day, according to current owners Chris and Corinna Loh. \n“We wouldn’t be able to survive without the tourism and the park,” said Chris Loh. “Realistically, it’s our bread and butter.” Loh said it’s also fun to meet the people from all over the world who come into the bar and restaurant during the tourism season. \nRichard and Elsa Lau, of Hong Kong, attended Thursday’s event in Yosemite Valley after arriving at the park Wednesday. The couple said they had traveled around California in the past but never made it to Yosemite, though they always wanted to visit. \nThe idea of protecting special places like Yosemite is one that should be embraced around the world, Richard Lau said.“Whether you’re American, British, Chinese, Japanese … We should all be doing this,” he said. \nA 2009 documentary by filmmaker Ken Burns hailed the U.S. national park system as “America’s best idea.” It now consists of 59 national parks that generates nearly $30 billion annually. \nThe event also focused on educating youth about the significance of national parks and preserving public lands. \nBill Harrer, of Rocklin, has been staying in the park for the past week with three generations of his family, including his wife, children and grandchildren. He said the event made him think about protecting public lands for the enjoyment of future generations. \n“This park is iconic,” he said. “To celebrate the anniversary and what we’ve been doing to save it for our kids and grandkids is very important.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:22:32.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
