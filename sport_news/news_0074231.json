It’s a little bit of an eye-opener from a soccer standpoint on just how good they were, but it was a great experience.” \nThe LHS midfielder was born in Kansas City, Missouri, but moved to the CNMI’s capital city of Saipan at the age of 5. Jewell resided in Saipan for nine years until moving to Lawrence just before his freshman year at LHS. With the Northern Mariana Islands being a United States territory, Jewell needed only to live there for two years before being eligible to play for the CNMI national team. \n“When I lived over there, they were the guys I played club with,” Jewell said of his CNMI teammates. “I’ve tried to stay in touch. A lot of them go to college in the States to play soccer.” \nThe odds were stacked against Jewell and the CNMI national team entering pool play qualifiers, as the majority of the players on the opposing teams were professionals. \n“These are guys where that’s what they do,” LHS coach Mike Murphy said of the competition Jewell faced. “They play soccer pretty much all the time, so he said that was pretty fun to be able to go against them. I’m sure that that’s an experience he’ll treasure for the rest of his life.” \nThe CNMI national team was outscored 38-0 in the span of four games against Chinese Taipei, Singapore, Thailand and Group H winner South Korea. Jewell said that the type of play in the tournament contrasted quite a bit compared to what he has seen in four years at LHS. \n“It’s completely different. Here, it’s more of an emphasis on the physical side, maybe strength and speed,” Jewell said. “Over there, it’s a lot more technical. Players may not be as big, but their skill set is just amazing.” \nWhile Jewell was overseas, Murphy said the midfielder’s presence was missed in the Lawrence High lineup. Murphy had to make adjustments with moving a couple of players into different positions while Jewell was out, but was glad his player got a chance to return to his old home. \n“The (assistant) coaches and I were actually talking about it before the game (Oct. 13 vs. Leavenworth). Do you think he appreciates that opportunity now as much as he will when he’s older?” Murphy said. “I think he does. I think he gets how cool that was.” \nJewell was inserted into the starting lineup on Lawrence High’s Senior Night against Leavenworth. The Lions suffered a 3-2 loss, but it did not take away from being able to take the field with his fellow seniors in Jewell’s final regular-season game at LHS. \nThe Lions (3-10-1) will wrap up the regular season with away games at 7:30 tonight against Shawnee Mission North and 6:15 p.m. Thursday at Shawnee Heights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:45:54.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
