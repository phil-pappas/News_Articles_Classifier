But Saenz didn’t mind — far from it. \nHe has a passion for film, and the festival is a way to bring quality independent short and feature length pieces to the Tri-Cities. \n“To see these films, you would normally have to go to Seattle, Spokane or Portland,” said Saenz, executive director. “I think this will be a breakout year for the festival.” \nIt runsOct. 16-18 in Richland, with a wide variety of offerings —from the documentary America’s Blues to Star Trek fan films, science fiction, animation and horror. \n240 Films in the festival \n72 Hours in one of the challenges \nFilmmakers Wade Chitwood, Scott Nakada, Kelly Wayne Hughes and Jeff Beauvoir are among those scheduled to participate in panels, along with writer William Nolan, who penned works including Logan’s Run . \nOne local filmmaker, Lisa Pixler, has a horror short in the festival. It’s called Saved! and it’s set to screen at 6 p.m. Oct. 17 at the Uptown Theatre. \nThe festival was formed when the Columbia Basin Video Festival and the RadCon Fan Film Festival joined forces a few years back. \nSaenz said it offers more interaction than the traditional movie-going experience. \n“We can all go to the movies, watch TV. But it’s a one-way experience — it’s coming to you,” he said. “When you come to this, you can meet artists, talk to the artists. That’s why I like film festivals a lot —you’ve got a little more involvement.” \nCost is $5 a day. Tickets are available at the door. \nThe festival also includes the 72 Hour Film Challenge, in which participants have a weekend to write, shoot and edit a piece. It’s going on now. \nFilms also are being shown at Whitman College in Walla Walla on Oct. 10 as part of the festival. \nFor the full schedule, go to www.trifi.org . \nSara Schilling: 509-582-1529; sschilling@tricityherald.com ; Twitter: @SaraTCHerald \nIF YOU GO \nWhat: Tri-Cities International Film Festival \nWhen: Oct. 16-18 \nWhere: Various spots in Richland \nCost: $5 a day, with tickets at the door", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:58:12.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
