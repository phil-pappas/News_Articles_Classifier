(AP) - A 97-year-old military veteran from western New York has received the French Legion of Honor for his service during World War II.\nA ceremony to honor Don Levine of Brighton was held Tuesday at Brighton Town Hall outside Rochester.\nAwarded by the president of France, the Legion of Honor is given to French and non-French citizens in recognition of service to France. Levine is being honored for helping to liberate the country from Nazi occupation.\nThe Air Force veteran flew 35 missions as a gunner and bombardier on B-24 Liberators during the war and was part of the Normandy, Battle of the Bulge, and Rhineland campaigns.\nThis story has been corrected to show that the veteran received the honor Tuesday instead of Wednesday, and that veteran was a gunner and bombardier instead of a pilot.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:39:32.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
