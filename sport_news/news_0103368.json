Davis said the defense can't just rush three players and use one player as a spy because then there's not enough of a pass rush. The blitzes are designed to keep Newton in the pocket, but they know he has the ability to escape. At that point, a spy is important. \n\"I'm going to be ready. He's a good runner,\" Barwin said. \"He's big. . . . He looks really good running the ball, so it's going to be a challenge.\" \nPanthers coach Ron Rivera, a former Eagles assistant, called Barwin \"a big roadblock\" who is a playmaker. He also lauded his quarterback, who is an early MVP candidate after helping the Panthers to a 5-0 start and leading them on a winning touchdown drive against Seattle on Sunday. \nNewton is the first mobile quarterback the Eagles will face this year. Last season, the Eagles played five of the top seven quarterbacks in rushing yards, including the top three. Barwin kept notes on each assignment, and he held onto them for reference. \n\"I need to go back and remember what I learned in that month last year,\" Barwin said. \"I kind of got better at it as we went on, so I need to pick up where we left off.\" \nEven though the Eagles have not played against a mobile quarterback, they practiced all summer against Tim Tebow. And considering the style of offense that Chip Kelly runs, the defense is familiar with the concept of a mobile quarterback. \n\"We haven't had it in six weeks [since Tebow's release], so we have to dust those conversations off and focus on it,\" Davis said. \nNewton is different than most quarterbacks because of his size. Linebacker Brandon Graham said arm tackles or sweeps at Newton's ankles don't always work. And Newton can shake off a defender, too. The Eagles are using third-string quarterback Thad Lewis as Newton on the scout team, but Lewis is 6-2 and 219 pounds. He doesn't fully simulate what Newton can do. \nThe Eagles' defense can be confident after back-to-back impressive performances against accomplished quarterbacks. They allowed only three touchdowns in two games against Drew Brees and Eli Manning. Newton is a different type of quarterback, though. He has a big arm and can beat teams through the air, but he holds the ball for the sixth-longest time among NFL starting quarterbacks, according to Pro Football Focus. So he's in the pocket longer, making him susceptible to sacks and a threat to run. He has been sacked only 10 times in five games this year. \nThe Eagles responded with a nine-sack performance last season. Newton is healthier and the Panthers are hotter, but the Eagles still have Barwin - a rare linebacker with the size to shadow Newton. \n\"It's just a guy with a ball and I'm trying to tackle him and I'm trying to stay in front of him,\" Barwin said. \"I'm going to try to tackle the arm that's holding the football and then get his body after that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:21:31.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
