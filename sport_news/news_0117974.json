The way you do that is when you're not playing, you make sure you know. \n\"If I found out (a player taking draws) is 1-of-5 or 1-of-6 right after we give up a faceoff goal at the end, then I'm not that smart. I just try and get the information the best I can, as quick as I can. \n\"I expect the goalie who is not playing to have the stats ready. Lots of times, the (stats crew) doing it in NHL rinks are fans of the home team. \n\"So I like to know what really happened, not what's on the sheet.\" \nDRAWN-OUT AFFAIR \nSpeaking of faceoffs -- the Leafs are among the NHL's most proficient -- they are just part of the structure the Leafs are trying to improve upon, particularly on offence. \nToronto has 13 goals in six games to date, but six of those came in one game. \n\"The heavier we get (on the puck), the more offence we get,\" Babcock said. \n\"These (Leafs he inherited) are used to playing a rush game. one and done. To me, that's not happening. You're in a fantasy world unless you're playing heavy in the offensive zone, catch (the other team) from behind and go again. \n\"We have some work to do, but we're talking about it and showing it. Over time, we hope it will be a habit.\" \nSEEING RED IN MONTREAL \nBabcock sounded just as sentimental about going back to Montreal as his earlier return to Detroit. \nHe attended university at McGill, graduating in 1986 with a bachelor's degree in physical education, and also did some post-graduate work in sports psychology. \nA defenceman and team captain with the Redmen, he had 107 points in 146 games (and 301 penalty minutes), making him the second-highest scoring defenceman in school history. \nHe was a two-time all-star and MVP. \n\"It's always fun going to Montreal,\" Babcock said Friday afternoon. \n\"I love going to the city myself, it's spectacular, so are their fans and their uniforms. They care about hockey there, no different than in Toronto.\" \nLOOSE LEAFS \nNewcomer forward Byron Froese is from Winkler, Man. Other National Hockey Leaguers to come from there include Eric Fehr , Justin Falk and Dustin Penner ... Froese mentioned the mirroring of systems with the Marlies and Leafs allowed him to step right in comfortably for his first practice of Friday ... The Marlies began three road games in three nights on Friday in Rochester, then on to Binghamton and Lehigh Valley ... Free agent forward Devin Setoguchi has two goals in two games for HC Davos in the Swiss League since getting cut by the Leafs at camp.
