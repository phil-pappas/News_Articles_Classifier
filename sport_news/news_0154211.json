It lasts only until the person is back in town on his next assignment. Despite a striking similarity in how these resolutions end, there’s a notable difference, too. Generally, the new year’s resolutions don’t last long because people aren’t determined enough; the failure to keep the Dhauladhar out of the cricket copy has more to do with its majestic presence rather than the imagination of the writer. It’s just impossible not to take note of the impressive and unique background while watching cricket being played in the mountain’s lap. So, having invoked the mighty mountain, let’s get back to the cricket. Despite this being one of the most idyllic settings for cricket in the world, there seems something amiss this time around. No, there’s nothing wrong with the mountains or this place; it’s just that the cricket bandwagon seems to have rolled into the town a little earlier than expected. When India and South Africa decided to have a 72-day-long series comprising four Tests, five ODIs and three T20Is, one thought the teams would be here at the fag end of the tour, not at the start to kick off the tour with a T20I match. Why?\nBecause generally the tour starts like this: Tests, ODIs and then a few T20Is. A long tour beginning with the T20Is, followed by the ODIs and then the Tests, considered the showpiece event of the tour, is almost unheard of. So, the BCCI and Cricket South Africa have broken a convention of sorts by reversing the order in which the three formats have generally been played so far. The impact of the decision goes well beyond mere sentimental reasons, something the Test aficionados are often accused of. In a tour as long as this, injuries, fatigue and loss of form are common occurrences. Thus, by the time the Test series starts a month later, after the T20Is and the ODIs are done with, there’s a fair chance that someone would be injured, someone else would be feeling totally jaded by then. Wouldn’t the Test series lose much of its sheen if, say, Virat Kohli or AB de Villiers have to miss it owing to a hamstring injury sustained during a T20I match or an ODI? Yes, they are professionals, and they need to give their best under all circumstances. However, at the same time, they are human, too, and they can get tired or injured. Or, is the move to have the T20Is at the start and the Tests at the end a sign of the changing times in which the shorter format attracts more eyeballs on the TV and ensures more footfalls in the stadium? It’s tough to say what the administrators have in mind but, thankfully, players seem to respect the longest format more than anything else, at least for now. “It’s a long tour, and there’s definitely a risk of someone getting injured, fatigue setting in, and someone losing form... especially with the Tests slotted at the end,” said Faf du Plessis, South Africa’s T20I skipper. “That is going to be a real challenge for all the guys who are going to be here the whole time. We take real pride in our Test cricket. We are the world No. 1, so our performances will always demand high standards.” Coming from a T20I skipper, the statement is quite significant and assuring. Despite sounding a little wary about Tests coming up so late in the contest, the South Africans are happy to kick off the tour at Dharamsala, the venue with arguably the liveliest wicket in the country. “It’s a lot different from the conditions in Delhi, where we played our practice match. It’s a nice place to start our campaign,” said du Plessis. For the cricket fans, the next 72 days, starting tomorrow, will offer a grand feast. It would have been better if the dessert had been served after the main course, not ahead of it. But then, times are changing; maybe our taste and habits are too. 0 number of T20Is played by South Africa in India 2 number of T20Is India have played in the last 12 months. Both against Zimbabwe where they won a game and lost the other 252 Runs in four matches make Faf du Plessis the leading scorer in T20Is this year", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:16:32.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
