Previously, anyone who received a OnePlus 2 invite to buy or to pass on was supposed to use it within 24 hours.\nOnePlus 2 is still the most sought after smartphone and it has the best specs to price ratio. Owning OnePlus One was not easy and the situation has not changed much with OnePlus 2. OnePlus said it will tweak its invites system in order to put more OnePlus 2 handsets in the hands of consumers.\nIn a big push to that notion, OnePlus has extended the invite expiration period to 3 days. OnePlus posted on Facebook, “You now have 3 days instead of 24 hours to claim your ‪#‎OnePlus2‬ invite. Thanks for your feedback, we’ll keep improving!”\nWatch video review of OnePlus 2\nWith OnePlus seeings its own share of competition from the likes of Motorola and Meizu, it’s arguable that OnePlus did amend its invite systems to keep more users interested in its device.\nFor record, OnePlus 2 is the second smartphone from Chinese tech startup OnePlus. The OnePlus 2 features a 5.5-inch full HD display and is powered by a Snapdragon 810 SOC. The handset comes with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. OnePlus 2 also retains that signature Sandstone back.\nOn the camera front, the OnePlus 2 gets a 13MP primary shooter and a 5MP secondary camera. The smartphone runs Android 5.1 Lollipop with Oxygen UI on top.\n 25, 2015 10:31 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/pP0iLhK7VLo"], "published": "2015-10-25T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:08:45.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
