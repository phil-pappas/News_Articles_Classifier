Neither will be the case as the Mountain Hawks head to Lewisburg where they were routed 48-10 two years ago. \n\"Our schedule has been challenging and we've said this before, the Ivies have some advantages now,\" Coen said of the losses to Princeton and Yale. \"I think our league will catch up to them once everybody gets their scholarships working the way Fordham's have. \n\"But for us right now, everybody's got to get better. In our sport, it's not just one guy who has to get better, everybody's got to get better. This is the ultimate team game.\" \nThe problems were team-wide against Yale. \nSome key numbers: \n•Yale outgained Lehigh 529-317, including 278-87 on the ground. \n•Yale had the ball for 32:32, Lehigh for 27:28. \n•Yale averaged five more yards per punt and 118 yards on five total punt and kick returns compared to Lehigh's 60 on the same number of returns. \n•Yale had nearly perfect offensive balance with 278 yards on the ground and 251 in the air, while Lehigh had 72.5 percent of its yards come through the passing game. \nLehigh did win the turnover battle, but not much else. \nYale surprised Coen with how well it ran the ball. \n\"That's a conversation we'll have to have to try and figure things out in that respect,\" Coen said. \"Yale hadn't really shown a tremendous ability to run the ball, at least not as efficiently as they did today. They dominated the line of scrimmage and the young man [sophomore Deshawn Salter with 233 yards rushing on 29 carries] did a great job for them.\" \nThe Mountain Hawks did get three turnovers against Yale, and that doesn't include the interception on the two-point try that Pierce Ripanti returned for a pair of Lehigh points. \nYet, Lehigh is still giving up 475.2 yards per game, which is just four-tenths of a yard less than last year's team surrendered. \n\"We did get a couple of turnovers, but we could have done a lot better,\" senior linebacker and Central Catholic graduate Noah Robb said Saturday. \"We were really focused on stopping their passing game this week and they came out and ran the ball down our throats. They came out and hit a lot of cutback gaps and we just really weren't ready for it in the beginning. \n\"I thought we did a better job of tackling this week than in previous weeks, but there's still a lot of room to improve.\" \nAnd that goes for the offense as well. \nIf you take out three touchdowns in the second half against Penn, Lehigh's offense has just two second-half TDs all season as the Mountain Hawks are plagued by inconsistency on that side of the ball as well. \nToo much of the offense seems to center on quarterback Nick Shafnisky, who not only has passed the ball 185 times, but has run it 86 times, almost as many attempts as the team's top two running backs — Dom Bragalone and Micco Brisker — combined (96). \nThe good news is that the most meaningful games of the season are ahead. \n\"We're excited to play Bucknell and put these last couple of games behind us,\" Robb said. \n\"I can't wait to start Patriot League play and get the ball rolling',\" Shafnisky said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:59:47.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
