I was able to enjoy the match.\" \nIn the last eight, Nadal will play French Open champion Stan Wawrinka, who needed nearly three hours to defeat Marin Cilic 7-5 6-7 (7/9) 6-4. \nDjokovic registered the 70th win of his exceptional season in customary dominant fashion, easing past Feliciano Lopez 6-2 6-3. \nHis quarter-final opponent will be Australian Bernard Tomic, who did not walk off the court until after midnight following an impressive 6-3 6-7 (1/7) 6-4 victory over Richard Gasquet. \nThird seed Andy Murray was another player to come through a tough three-setter, the two-time grand slam champion edging a high-quality encounter against John Isner 6-7 (4/7) 6-4 6-4. \nMurray next meets fifth seed Tomas Berdych, a 6-3 6-3 winner over Gilles Simon, while Kevin Anderson will play Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. \nAnderson, the newest member of the world's top 10, upset Kei Nishikori in two tie-breaks, with Tsonga ending the run of Roger Federer's conqueror Albert Ramos-Vinolas - although not without a fight. \nRamos-Vinolas won the opening set but Frenchman Tsonga hit back to triumph 6-7 (5/7) 7-5 6-4.
