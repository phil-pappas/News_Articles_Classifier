We look forward to a competitive game and a great environment at our stadium.\" \nThe Huskies are going the longest distance ever for the program (2,000 miles) to play a regular-season game — at 10:15 p.m. no less in a shortened week of practice. Neither the environment nor atmosphere got to them in playing in front of a large crowd (70,079) at Missouri in Week 3. The Huskies lost 9-6 but very well could have won. So stage fright and crowd noise at LaVell Edwards, which seats 63,470), should not be an issue. \nBYU, which lost dual-threat quarterback Taysom Hill for the season in the opener, may not yet be what it has been offensively with Mangum running the show, but it is pretty good. The issue for the Cougars, even beyond Hill, has been health. Their leading running back, Adam Hine, is listed as doubtful with an ankle injury, but the team is high on freshman Francis Bernard (four carries, 30 yards). \nBYU likes to establish physicality in the run game to set up the passing game. UConn is 73rd against the run at 170 yards allowed per game, but the Huskies just played Navy, third in the country in rushing. Navy rang up 343 on UConn in a 28-18 win at Rentschler Field last week. \n\"To me, it's another team that I've had the opportunity to be around for a long time,\" Diaco said. \"You can recall footage from Rich Rodriguez. This offense is a Rich Rod trait. Running the ball is a necessary component, and running the ball with authority. It's spread, but it's not a pass-spread offense, it's a run-spread offense. I'm not in their staff room, and I don't know exactly what they are talking about right now, but I'd be shocked if it wasn't, `Hey, we have to get back to who we are.\" \nThe UConn defense has a chance to get back to where it was before playing against Navy's triple option. The BYU offense is closer to a traditional style of football. \nAnae said it's time for BYU to be resilient and bounce back after the two losses. The same can be said for UConn. \nThe Huskies' response comes Friday night. \n\"To fly out west and play BYU, a team that beat [us badly] a year ago, it's an exciting challenge and an exciting opportunity,\" Diaco said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:52:55.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
