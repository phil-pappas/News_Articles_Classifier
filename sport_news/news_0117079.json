Kyle Bailey fired a 42. \n“One of the biggest things going for us was that we could get outstanding scores from anybody,” Sposato added. \nBryce Johnson and Andrew Christensen carded 41s for Penn Yan (6-6, 6-5). \nWayne 239, Midlakes incomplete \nPal-Mac 250, Midlakes incomplete \nHOPEWELL — John Sweeney shot a 4-over 40 for Wayne (9-4, 7-4) at Clifton Springs Country Club. \nNick Smith chalked up a 42 for Midlakes (1-10).
