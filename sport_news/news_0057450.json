(WKRC) -- A furious comeback bid brought the No. 14/15 Miami hockey team to within a goal midway through the third period, but No. 17 St. Lawrence withstood the third period barrage to top the RedHawks 5-3 on Saturday night. \nThe setback snaps Miami's (3-2-1) four-game unbeaten streak and its three-game winning streak as it settles for the weekend split. \nLike in the opener, Saturday night's game displayed a frantic pace from the opening draw with both teams trading rushes in the early going. The Saints (4-2) got the first break of the night when Jacob Pritchard fired a shot from the half wall that was going well wide, but hit a RedHawk skate and redirected into the back of the net just 6:21 in, breaking Ryan McKay's shutout streak at 99:27. It also marked the first time Miami did not score the first goal in a game this season. \nSt. Lawrence outshot Miami by an 11-6 margin in the opening 20 minutes of play and each side had a power play, but the penalty killers shined on both sides to fend off the man advantages. The RedHawks' best scoring opportunity came around midway through the opening stanza when a centering pass set up Kevin Morris from in close, but Kyle Hayton kept it in front of him and the Saints skated to the dressing room with a 1-0 lead at intermission. \nThe RedHawks' forecheck hemmed the Saints in their defensive zone for a few minutes early in the period and one particular shift saw solid looks from Zach LaValle in close, Louie Belpedio from the point and Kevin Morris from the high slot, all of which were either stopped by Hayton or sent wide of the cage. SLU countered by getting sustained possession in MU's end and eventually forced the Red and White into using their timeout midway through the frame after an icing infraction. \nThat timeout seemed to calm things down for Miami as it responded with some improved play and eventually a tying goal at the 10:24 mark. Jack Roslovic's shot from the half wall was blocked by a SLU defender and went right into the middle for an on-rushing Chris Joyaux. The senior blue liner wired a slapshot past Hayton for his second goal of the year to even the score at 1-1. Anthony Louis also drew an assist on the goal. \nJoyaux's goal energized the `Hawks over the next few shifts and eventually drew a Saints' penalty with 6:49 left in the middle frame. Miami fired four quality shots Hayton's way, with a Kuraly blast from above the right circle getting shrugged off, a wrister from the slot by Roslovic being deflected away by a glove and a one-timer by Morris being steered aside in a 30-second span. \nShortly after the power play expired, the Saints scored twice 28 seconds apart as Sean McGovern wristed a shot through a defenseman in transition and Mike Marnell followed by backhanding a shot off the post and in on the ensuing shift to open up a 3-1 lead after two periods. \nSt. Lawrence added to its lead at the 5:03 mark as Tommy Thompson cashed in a rebound to make it 4-1. With things looking bleak, a power play injected some new life into the RedHawks midway through the final regulation frame. Matthew Caito struck on the power play when his sharp angle shot redirected in off Hayton's pad from a sharp angle with Morris and Belpedio picking up assists on that play. Belpedio drew another assist 48 seconds later when he got the puck to Alex Gacek, who drove down the slot and buried a shot to cut the gap to 4-3 with 9:23 to go. \nMiami continued putting pressure on the St. Lawrence net, firing 16 of its 32 shots in the final 20 minutes of play. The RedHawks pulled McKay for an extra attacker with 1:11 left and had an offensive zone faceoff to work with. The Saints stymied that rally when Mike Marnell broke up a possession at the blue line and fired the puck into the empty net with 33 seconds remaining to seal away the win. \nA 16-7 third period shot advantage gave Miami a 32-31 edge for the game. The Red and White also converted 1-of-4 power plays while killing off both Saints' man advantages. McKay picked up his first loss of the year after making 26 saves while Hayton stopped 29 of 32 shots. \nThe RedHawks begin National Collegiate Hockey Conference play at St. Cloud State next weekend. The series starts on Friday night at 8:37 p.m. \nImage and information provided by Miami University Athletics Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:28:31.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
