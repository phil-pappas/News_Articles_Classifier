Some people don’t,” Carney told the Nine Network. \n“I want it to be cleaned up because I think one day the club might think back to what’s happened to me and it might help another player.” \nCarney resumed his playing career in France with Super League club Catalans and last month signed a three-year contract extension. \nHowever he did not rule out a return to Australia, saying he still got goosebumps watching the game. \nCarney has a lengthy rap sheet, having previously been sacked by Canberra and Sydney Roosters for alcohol-related issues. \nHe was axed by the Raiders in 2008 after being accused of urinating on a patron in a nightclub while he was let go by the Roosters for breaching an alcohol ban in 2011, the year after guiding them to the premiership and winning the Dally M. \nWhile he has a chequered past, his lawyer Julieanne Levick said Cronulla had not followed due process by allowing him a hearing. \n“If they had acted reasonably in the first instance we wouldn’t be here now,” she said. \n“It would’ve been settled.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:04:49.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
