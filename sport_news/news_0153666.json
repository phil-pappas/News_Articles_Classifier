But over the last few days the Sandwich Blue Knights have certainly put themselves in the driver’s seat as the halfway mark nears. Sarah Condon scored both goals and the Blue Knights held off a late surge by defending-ACL champion Dennis-Yarmouth to prevail 2-1 on Tuesday afternoon at Karen Olander Field Hockey Field. Sandwich (7-1-1 overall) took over sole possession of first place in the ACL at 3-0. The Blue Knights blanked perennial ACL-contender Falmouth 1-0 on Sunday and are now the lone undefeated team in the league. Sandwich avenged both a loss to the Dolphins (4-3, 2-1 ACL) in the regular season finale a year ago, as well as a 1-0 Dolphins victory in the 2014 Division 2 South Sectional semifinals in South Yarmouth. Condon scored the lone goal of the opening half, and then tallied again just five minutes into the second to give the Blue Knights a 2-0 lead. The goals were her ninth and 10th on the season but much of the credit goes to Samantha Souke, whose crossing pass found Conlon at the left side of the net on both occasions. “We work on that play in practice and it’s effective, especially against a tough team,” said Condon, one of just five seniors on the relatively young Sandwich squad. “We worked hard in practice and came in determined and wanting to win.” Junior forwards Zoe Clarkin and Souke were instrumental in creating opportunities throughout the first half and much of the second, helping the Blue Knights maintain an advantage in field possession for much of the contest. “Everyone has a role and if everyone does their job, good things happen,” said Sandwich coach Kelsy Beaton. “Sami creates a lot for us and she’s not selfish, which is the most beautiful thing. These were two big wins in a row and well-earned.” Champions don’t go down easily and such was the case on Tuesday. Summer Walsh scored from Taylor Conley with just over 10 minutes remaining to pull D-Y within a goal and another six corners from the Dolphins threatened to even the match. But senior goalie Anna Hurley turned away several shots, twice coming nearly halfway out to the circle to cut down the angle and preserve the Sandwich victory. “I never come out that high,” said Hurley, who came into the contest with five straight shutouts. “I told my sweeper (Anne Davis) that I’m coming out and she had the post.” The win was extra sweet for Blue Knights defensive-midfielder Carly Whittle, who celebrated her 18th birthday with an outstanding effort, clearing the last two balls out of the circle. “When it’s that close and you are tired, the only thing you are thinking about is to get that ball out,” said Whittle after the game while enjoying some of her birthday dessert. “I wanted to win today, one cause it’s my birthday and two because it’s been a long time since we’ve beaten D-Y.” Conley and Walsh were effective in creating several of the Dolphins scoring chances down the stretch, while Anna McGaffigan had a solid effort in the midfield. “You can’t play half-asleep for 45 minutes and then decide to get back in the game and expect to win,” said D-Y coach Mary O’Connor. “We needed to come out much faster and be on the attack earlier.” By Paul Godfrey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:25:38.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
