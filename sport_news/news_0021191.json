Granted, it is only the preseason, but Anthony’s surgically repaired knee has not been an issue and his game appears to be in midseason form. Anthony has made 18 of 25 shots and has scored a combined 38 points in wins over Brazilian club Bauru and the Washington Wizards.\n“It’s nice to just get back out there, man,” Anthony said late Friday, after the win over Washington. “The most important thing is being healthy. When you’re healthy, everything kind of falls into place mentally. There’s a lot of clarity for me at this moment where I can just play ball and not worry about no tick tack injury or having surgery or things like that. I can just help my team.”\nAnthony was limited to 40 games last season before being shut down following the All-Star Game in February. The forward’s absence left Fisher without a proven scorer as the Knicks finished with a franchise-worst 17-65 record. Although team president Phil Jackson upgraded the roster over the summer, he failed to add another All-Star caliber player.\nSolid role players will help but the only thing that stands between the Knicks competing for a postseason berth and losing 50-plus games is having Anthony back to being a top 15 player and available for at least 70 games.\nFisher understands as much as anyone the importance of having a healthy All-Star. With the Lakers, Fisher won championships as a supporting player to Shaquille O’Neal and\nKobe Bryant. As a rookie head coach, Fisher struggled with Anthony in the lineup. Without Anthony, Fisher and the Knicks were a lost cause.\nOn Friday, Anthony came out in support of Fisher, who has been embroiled in controversy for leaving on a cross-country flight after the fifth day of practice and getting into a physical altercation in Los Angeles with Memphis Grizzlies forward Matt Barnes. Fisher is reportedly dating Barnes’ estranged wife, Gloria Govan, who once starred in the reality TV show “Basketball Wives.”\nFisher told the Knicks he needed to return home to see his children, yet on Saturday he ended up at the home that Barnes owns. Fisher then missed Monday’s practice for what the Knicks originally said was a “personal issue.” Fisher, though, explained that equipment problems with a private jet were the cause of his absence.\nFisher has had his judgment come into question for leaving the team just five days into training camp and then missing a practice. An active player would likely have been fined or suspended for a similar offense.\nThe Knicks have not taken disciplinary action, while Fisher disputed the notion that he is not fully committed to the job. Of course, it is uncommon for a coach in any professional sport to leave the team five days into training camp and miss a practice. That Fisher ended up getting into a fight with an active player’s wife made it look even worse.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nJackson has yet to publicly address the issue. According to a source, Knicks players learned of the fight long before Fisher spoke with them as a group prior to the preseason opener. In fact, several players were aware of what happened to Fisher before Jackson was debriefed.\nAmong NBA players, coaches and executives, the Fisher-Barnes altercation has become the talk of the league. And while Madison Square Garden officials have gone to great lengths to quash the story, they also fear that more sordid details could emerge. And having been well versed in crisis management over the years, the Garden is also aware that a quick start to the regular season would help change the narrative.\n“Whatever he’s dealing with, he’s going through, he’s going on his own time,” Anthony said. “He comes in here and it’s Derek Fisher. He comes in here, he’s kind of upbeat. He’s not letting that come into our locker room. When you have that mentality as a leader then it trickles down to everybody.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:58:34.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
