Poster boy of cue sports in India, Pankaj Advani proved his mettle yet again after winning his 14th world title in Adelaide on Sunday, defeating Singapore's Peter Gilchrist. Post the win, the world champ got vocal on sports, spirituality, style, shaadi and more...\nYou won your 14th world title on the day Lord Ganpati was leaving for his divine abode. Do you think it is a gift from the Lord?\nMy big wins usually happen on auspicious days. I won my first world title in 2003 on Diwali. Few years ago, I won this same world billiards title on my mom's birthday. Eid, Independence Day, even Children's Day have marked some of my most memorable golds.\nAre you a spiritual person or do you carry a lucky charm along like so many other international athletes?\nI am spiritual (not religious) in my faith and believe in a superior force. I used to be superstitious but then realised that I was placing my faith in things that really had little or no relevance to my performance. I've started to believe more in my own ability and of course something far greater out there that is looking after us.\nYou have won so many titles across the globe. But closer home do you think your sport has got its real due?\nMy sport hasn't got its due yet. Maybe I am too optimistic for my own good, but I do believe that everyone will get their due sooner or later. My only hope is that all sports in India are treated equally, and there is no discrimination between Olympic and non-Olympic sports. All the players work as hard and face the toughest competition and conditions across the world in each sport. Let's be fair to all! Let the reward be for consistency and performance, not for the type of sport you play.\nIt is said that your sports psychologist brother Shree motivated you the night before the big game where you annihilated your opponent...\nYes and it helped. Shree is already working with so many athletes who are gearing up for many international events. His track record shows how critical mind coaching is for excellence on the big stage of sport across numerous disciplines. I strongly urge all Indian athletes and parents to get started on this crucial aspect of sports development as early as possible. Sport psychology will be the game-changer.\nYou missed out on the Ganpati fervour at home but now that you are back, is the foodie in you looking forward to any particular kind of comfort food during Navratri and Diwali?\nI really am looking forward to eating home food after all the outside grub I have been made to have due to extensive travel over the last couple of months.\nYou are known to be a stylishly dressed player. Which Indian player (male and female) has that inimitable glamorous dressing sense according to you.\nI find our tennis stars Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi to have a stylish dressing sense.\nSania, you and Abhinav Bindra brought laurels to country back-to-back on Saturday and Sunday. Did you guys wish one another on social networking sites?\nMy access to social media during tournaments is almost non-existent. It's a deliberate choice in order to stay focussed. But I am excited about how awesome last weekend turned out to be for Indian sports. Congrats Sania and Abhinav!\nGrapevine says your family is looking for a pretty Sindhi bride for you. What about all those heartbroken girls out there? Any words of solace for them?\nMy family is very broadminded, so Sindhi is not a criterion. I want a like-minded woman of substance and that is what is important to my family too. But I am actually not aware about them actively looking for a match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:07:58.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
