(Photo: Duane Rankin/Advertiser) Duane Rankin , Montgomery Advertiser 2:47 p.m. CDT October 5, 2015 \nTUSCALOOSA -- Ready. Aim. Fire. \nNick Saban took a shot at those in the media who \"buried\" Alabama after the Ole Miss loss two weeks ago. \n\"IF IT WAS UP TO YOU, WE'RE SIX FOOT UNDER ALREADY,\" Saban ranted with hand gestures during today's press conference. \"WE'RE DEAD AND BURIED AND GONE! GONE!\" Alabama coach Nick Saban takes issue with media for its criticism of the Crimson Tide. Duane Rankin/Montgomery Advertiser \nWhen Alabama lost, 43-37, to the Rebels at home to suffer its first loss in September since Saban's first year in 2007, it was considered by some a major crack in the Crimson Tide's aura and mystique. Alabama had a players' only meeting the following week and stressed not listening to anyone outside of team. \nThe Crimson Tide bounced back from the Ole Miss loss to shut out Louisiana Monroe, 34-0, and blast Georgia, 38-10, in Athens. Now back in the AP Top 10, the No. 8-ranked Crimson Tide (5-1, 1-1 SEC) are back in the national championship conversation, but Saban want to let the media know how he felt about what was said about his team just two weeks earlier. \n\"I said before I believe in our team,\" Saban said. \"I do believe in our team and we're going to work hard to make our team better and I hope our players respond the right way and it's not going to be for you.\" \nSaban ended his comments with a joke that the media laughing. \n\"If that was the case, we'd have to get some respirators or something down there to put life back in people,\" Saban added. \nThree things you have to understand about Saban. One, he's very prideful. Two, he has no issues going after the media. Three, Saban takes advantage of any chance he gets to make a point to his team through the media. \nAt the same time, not every media representative wrote off Alabama after Ole Miss loss. You hear what you want to hear and teams are often motivated more by criticism than praise \nSo I didn't think the reporter deserved that type of reaction, but when you understand Saban's ways, it wasn't a surprise. \nIt's all good.
