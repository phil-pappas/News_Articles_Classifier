His ability to beat one-on-one coverage and alter routes to help out Towles has been huge part of the offense’s success this year. After hearing what Will Muschamp said to Johnson after the game on Thursday, we know that Kentucky got a special player in Johnson. As a true sophomore, I am excited to have this guy around for a couple more yeas. \nIt’s time for Matt Elam to shine \nElam is a name we have not heard much this season, but that is about to change. With the season ending injury to Melvin Lewis, Elam is going to have to step up in his place. Melvin Lewis has been great this season and it’s a huge loss to the defense, but the coaches have full trust in Elam. “Matt will be ready. I though he did some good things. This a great opportunity for him and he needs to step up and play,” Stoops said. \nStoops believes this game will be the biggest challenge of the season \nKentucky’s trip to Starkville might be the hardest challenge for the Cats this season. Out of Mississippi State’s 22 starters, 21 of them are juniors and seniors. This is one of the most experienced teams in all of college football and will be a true test for a young Kentucky team. Saturday’s game will tell us a lot about this Kentucky team and the rest of the season. \nDak Prescott has not thrown an interception this season \nKentucky’s secondary has to be ready to come out and play on Saturday. Prescott is one of the most talented quarterbacks in the SEC with his dual threat ability to make plays. The secondary has to be able to make plays and compete with Mississippi State’s talented wide receivers. Contesting passes and putting pressure on Prescott will be crucial for Kentucky’s defense. \nThe full return of the Mac \nAustin MacGinnis is set to do the kick-offs against Mississippi State. After handling only field goals against Auburn, MacGinnis will return to his role of doing kick-offs. Jordan Jones, who has been sidelined with an ankle injury, should practice this week and play on Saturday. \nArticle written by Kindsey Bernhard If your dreams don't scare you, they're not big enough. @kbernhardKSR 9 responses to “Five Takeaways from Mark Stoops’ Monday Press Conference” Dong Wong October 19, 2015 at 1:55   \nOnly game don’t worry too much Stoop Ha!  04 pm | Permalink \n2-4….. tippytoe  00   \nI agree Juice is special, but why doesn’t Towles throw to him more? Especially on the money downs. The rest of the receivers are not reliable. T White  08   \nWhile we could very well be 6-0, we should be happy with 4-2. In years past, we are most likely sitting at 1-5. The biggest difference with the rest of the season is the fact there isn’t a game left on the schedule that we can’t win. Pleased with the process. Keep throwing to Juice. jcatron  11 pm | Permalink \n+1 theWilkman  57 pm | Permalink \nTake is a step further, we could also be 0-6. 4-2 is a great place to be at this point in the season. Fans disappointed with 4-2 need to check their expectations. Those same fans would have been stoked if you told them that would be our record this summer. Troll  38   \nMiss St. is #2 of the 4 game losing streak. Things are getting better but a long way away at the same time. Captain Obvious  39 pm | Permalink \nNo shit, Sherlock. Did you expect the SEC title this year? BAdams October 19, 2015 at 3:00 pm | Permalink \nAfter having 2 win seasons not long ago, I’ll take a 6-6 record with a bowl game. But something you guys have to remember, our guys are young and they are only going to continue to learn from game film. We already pulled out some victories we normally would have not gotten.
