He said he’ll be back next year.\n“The Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta is a world-famous show,” he said. “I see all my friends, gas balloon pilots and other pilots. Albuquerque, I believe, is the capital of balloonists.”\nAna Padilla, holding 4-month-old Gemma, admires the hot-air balloons with her sister Gloria Padilla, second from left, and Rudy Lucero, third from left, during the mass ascension Saturday at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.

Everyone but him was making their first balloon ride. A crowd surrounding the balloon cheered as it took off.\nMelody Wells is the Oct. 10 winner of the Albuquerque Journal Kim Jew Portrait Art Balloon Fiesta Photo Contest for her image titled “Not Your Balloonist’s Champagne Bubble.”\nBradley, a longtime balloon pilot with a record-breaking résumé, said that, even after taking part in 34 Fiestas, he is still in awe of the mass ascension.\n“When you see 600 balloons flying at the same time,” Bradley said, “it really does never get old.”\nIt was a great day for a flight and Balloon Fiesta Park was packed with people who saw the favorite balloons – including those shaped like bees, penguins, a pig, a cow, Darth Vader and Yoda – take off. It was the eighth straight day the balloons were able to take to the air.\nTiukhtyaev was just a passenger on the flights he took at the Fiesta this year, something unusual for him.\n“It’s interesting to be a passenger,” Tiukhtyaev said. “Because, if I’m not a pilot, I have more time to speak about (the flight) and to see.”\nWith untied shoes, the Mister Bup balloon launches Saturday morning from Balloon Fiesta Park.
