It has inspired countless articles and books. It has become an integral part of the lives of thousands of families around the globe.\nAnd now? Bankrupt. Straddled with debt. Fighting with unions.\nHow did it happen? How did General Motors go from a company that embodied American success to one of the largest corporate failures in American history? The Daily News talked to automotive experts to find out. Here's what they said:\nLess-than-stellar product\nGeneral Motors has produced some stellar cars. The Corvette , Pontiac GTO , Camaro and Trans Am, to name a few.\nBut it has also manufactured some less-than-stellar automobiles. Quite a few of them actually. Remember the Chevy Vega ? The Citation? The Chevette? Should I go on?\n“Many cars had a design and interiors that were not stellar and performance that wasn’t the best,” said Dave Thomas , Senior Editor of Cars.com.\nThomas added that in recent years, GM has stepped it up in terms of the quality of their product. But it may have been too little too late.\n“You remember the bad car your brother or dad had,” Thomas added.\nHe could be onto something: General Motors’ marketshare fell from more than 50 percent in 1962 to about 23 percent in 2007.\nStaggering legacy costs\nGeneral Motors is straddled with the ‘legacy costs’ of providing healthcare and pensions to a host of retired workers, which cost GM millions of dollars every single year.\n“When GM agreed to them, the company was lauded as an example of good corporate governance. Now, everyone says, ‘How did they agree to this?’ Back then, it was considered enlightened. But now, it’s a different story,” said Jeremy Anwyl , CEO of Edmunds.com.\nThese legacy costs shake out to be about $2,000 per car, David Cole , Chairman of the Center for Automotive Research , said. And that $2,000 has to be passed along to the consumer if GM wants to turn a significant profit.\nAn “elite group of accountant princes”\nGeneral Motors managers became very numbers obsessed and bottom-line driven - to the detriment of innovation, creativity and ultimately the product itself.\nThomas called the GM management of a few years back a “bunch of bean counters.”\nA piece in The Examiner dubbed it “a culture born of an elite clique of accountant princes developed a stranglehold on the corporation.”\nThis ‘elite group of accountant princes’ apparently liked the status quo - a lot. In John Delorean� ��s 1973 book about GM (he worked at the automaker), he chronicles how his attempts to create better-quality GM cars were hindered by management’s focus on the bottom line and preoccupation with not changing GM’s management system.\n“They didn’t want to hear much of anything negative,” Thomas said, referring to GM management of a few years back.\nThe bean-counting, keep-the-status-quo system came back to hurt GM in the end. As The Examiner put it:\n“This approach can only work for a limited amount of time, for it contains the seeds of its own destruction.”\nThomas agrees, saying that the auto industry is very product-driven. While GM was obsessing over the bottom-line, it missed the boat on creating automobiles that more people would buy - and love.\nFuel economy standards\nFederal fuel economy standards, especially the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations, played a role in GM’s demise. In 1975, Congress passed the Energy Policy Conservation Act, which established fuel efficiency standards for cars, setting standards for the average fuel economy of an automaker's entire fleet of cars.\nGM made money on its larger - and less fuel efficient - cars and trucks. But with the new fuel efficiency standards, GM had to make a certain number of fuel-efficient cars in order to balance out the larger, less-fuel-efficient ones. So GM cranked out these smaller cars at a loss so that they could continue to produce the larger more profitable ones.\n“GM had no incentive to invest in smaller cars because they lost money on them anyway,” Anwyl said.\nYou can see the impact that CAFE has on GM from these 2007 comments by GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz in response to proposed CAFE changes:\n“The minute we have confirmation of the 35-mpg rule, that is the point where we go through all of our forward product plans and probably introduce, frankly, massive restructuring of the product plan.”\nAnd so GM was slow to develop fuel-efficient vehicles. When consumers began demanding such vehicles and stopped wanting larger cars like SUVs so much, GM was in a bit of a bind.\nEconomic downturn\nAnd of course, the massive recession just helped put the nail in the coffin for GM.\nAll of the above problems were already affecting GM, and then the economy slowed and General Motors got hit - hard.\nAnd what was once a 'Great American Company' is now a bankrupt ghost of its former self.\nRelated Gallery: View Gallery Related News Bondholders rebel, now GM bankruptcy seems inevitable Bondholders agree to deal but GM bankruptcy still pretty certain", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:31:28.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
