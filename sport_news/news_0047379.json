We needed that first one,” PM West head coach Jim McCarroll said. The Panthers had fantastic performances from several underclassmen. Chris Monaco hauled in a 51-yard reception on a double pass play to put West up early. Monaco led the team with nine catches for 136 yards and two touchdowns, as well as three carries for 22 yards and a rushing touchdown. Greg Bensley also showed some diversity, adding three catches for 61 yards and a touchdown and a 29-yard rush for another touchdown. Quarterback Dylan Della Valle went 17-for-25 for 188 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. Matt Mussenden fueled the running game for West with 20 carries for 54 yards and a touchdown. “These young guys are huge for us,\" McCarroll said. \"Chris (Monaco) is showing us how diverse he is, Bensley and Della Valle both came up big tonight. Matt (Mussenden) may not have had a big night, but he is a major part of our offense.\" The Panther defense came up big all night as well. Josh and Jarrett Padmore both gave Allen quarterback Jovontia James-Wright trouble from the secondary. Jarrett broke up several passes, and Josh added an interception, as well as combining with Jon Giuffrida for a safety. Bensley, Monaco, and senior Brandon Swingle kept the intensity levels high, making it very difficult for the Canaries to move the ball. At the end of the night, the Panthers forced four turnovers, collected three sacks, stopped Allen’s offense three times on fourth down, and collected a safety. West will look to carry this momentum into Friday’s homecoming matchup against East Stroudsburg South. - Ryan Laroco ES South EAST STROUDSBURG – For a player who has only had one catch in the last two weeks, East Stroudsburg South junior receiver Dakota Kross enjoyed his best game of the season. The 5-foot-10, 165-pounder caught five passes for 71 yards in Friday night’s 50-20 loss to Pleasant Valley. Kross had four catches in Week 2 against Pocono Mountain East, but on Friday night, Kross was the Cavs’ best receiving option. Changa Hodge had a strong performance as well – the senior wideout caught three passes and two went for touchdowns – but Kross did the job equally well. Kross caught passes of 33 and 26 yards and put a shining light on what was a less-than-perfect night for Eastburg South (1-5). Credit Cirillo as well as the junior had a huge game, passing for 257 yards and running for another 118. At 6-4, 215 pounds, Cirillo has blossomed into one of the area’s top quarterbacks. - Mike Kuhns Pleasant Valley EAST STROUDSBURG – What doesn’t Mike Mitchell do? The junior returns kicks, catches passes and makes plays at corner as well. At 170 pounds, it’s Mitchell’s speed that catches opponents off guard. Pleasant Valley (3-3) loves to get Mitchell the ball anyway it can. The Bears will line him up in the slot and give him the ball in a speed sweep, they’ll run screens to him or they’ll watch him run on a fly pattern and let quarterback Mikey Brown throw it as far as he can. On the last play of the first quarter in Friday’s 50-20 victory over East Stroudsburg South, the Cavs got a taste of Mitchell’s speed on a sweep. Mitchell took the ball in motion, darted around left end and sprinted 59 yards for a touchdown. Between Mitchell, Danny Hunter, Austyn Borre (129 yards rushing, 2 TDs) or Trent Thomas (85 yards rushing, TD), the Bears have some super offensive threats. - Mike Kuhns Stroudsburg SWIFTWATER – Jake Jakobsen and Jamaal Brome are probably the most lethal one-two punch in the EPC North. The Mounties’ (5-1) quarterback and running back duo proved why again on Friday in their 42-7 win over Pocono Mountain East, combining for 335 total yards. Jakobsen, who entered play with sore ribs, avoided big hits from the Cardinals and managed to throw for 177 yards and two touchdowns on Friday, getting solid protection from his offensive line despite being sacked three times. Brome used his patience to follow his blocks before breaking out his speed and strength to bust through tackles and find the end zone like he’s done for most of 2015. Marcello Riccardi has been Jakobsen’s favorite receiver this year. The senior wide receiver caught five passes for 108 yards and a touchdown on Friday, and even decided to show off his hands on the defensive side of the ball. He intercepted Pocono East quarterback Jacob Keane’s pass and returned it for 57 yards for another touchdown in the second quarter. Stroudsburg is known for its talent, and with a roster like this, it’s no wonder the Mounties have only lost once. - Zach Sturniolo PM East SWIFTWATER – Matt Fisher’s talent was on display in Friday’s 42-7 loss Friday night. The Cardinals’ (2-4) junior running back picked up 79 yards on 16 carries against the Mounties, bringing his total rushing yards to 491 yards this season. While Friday’s 79 yards might not be the same as his 252 yards and four touchdowns from a week ago at Allen, Fisher still showed he has plenty of potential to pick up big yardage. He rushed for 23 and 18 yards respectfully on back-to-back plays, using patience of his own to find the right blocks. Against a team like Stroudsburg, it was tough to find much more room to run. The Cardinals face another difficult team next, visiting Bethlehem Catholic next Saturday at 1:30 p.m. - Zach Sturniolo ES North East Stroudsburg North (2-4) played a brilliant first half in their 28-6 home loss to Bethlehem Catholic Friday night. The Timberwolves played ball-control offense and kept the high-powered Golden Hawks offense on the sideline. The defense stopped Bethlehem Catholic on downs on its opening drive. ES North's Willie Seabrooks picked off Julian Spigner on the Golden Hawks' second drive and it led to a textbook drive by North. The drive covered 37 yards on 13 plays - nine rushes by Joey Brown and four by Thomas Melchiorre. North converted three fourth downs on the drive as well. Brown capped off the drive with a 2 yard touchdown run. The Timberwolves trailed 7-6 at halftime, but were out scored 21-0 in the third quarter. Joseph Smith's 35-yard interception return touchdown put the game away late for Bethlehem Catholic. Despite losing their last two games, North has a favorable schedule down the stretch to make a run at a district playoff berth. - Matt Nyman PM West 41, Allen 12 Allen 0 6 0 6 12 PMW 6 6 8 21 41 First Quarter PMW - Chris Monaco 51 pass from Anthony Armstrong 8:55 (Matt Azzarelli kick no good) Second Quarter PMW - Monaco 19 run 11:18 (2 pt. no good) A - Muaz Chaudhry 85 run 2:12 (2 pt. no good) Third Quarter PMW - Greg Bensley 47 pass from Dylan Della Valle 10:16 (2 pt. no good) PMW - Josh Padmore, Jon Giuffrida sack for safety 1:19 Fourth Quarter PMW - Monaco 29 pass from Della Valle 9:31 (Azzarelli kick good) PMW - Bensley 29 run 7:05 (Azzarelli kick good) PMW - Matt Mussenden 6 run 3:10 (Azzarelli kick good) A - Christopher Ledee 8 pass from Angel Gonzalez (2 pt. no good) Team Statistics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:22:06.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
