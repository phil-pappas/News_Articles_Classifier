He lost his opening encounter in Glasgow and fell in the quarterfinals in Incheon. Last month, he lost in the semifinals of the Asian Boxing Championship in Bangkok. \n\nOn Saturday, the Guwahati-lad overcame that tough phase to become only the third Indian to assure himself a World Championships medal. He beat local favourite Hakan Erseker 3-0 on points in Doha. Vijender Singh and Vikas Krishan won a bronze each in Milan (2009) and Baku (2011) World Championships, respectively. Earlier, two other Indians, Pu Zoramthanga and V Devarajan, had won a bronze medal each in the boxing World Cup. \n\nShiva, the lone Indian to make the semifinals, is just a win away from bagging an Olympic berth. \n\n\"It was a good fight. I am happy to have assured myself a medal but getting the Olympics quota is my priority. I would say the previous two bouts were tougher. Erseker was a local favourite and I wanted to hit him with clear punches. \n\n\"I didn't want to get entangled into too much of holding and time wasting. Given the kind of tactics he was using, he was lucky to not to get a warning,\" Shiva, who is currently world No. 7, told TOI on Saturday . \n\nSunday's semifinal against Uzbekistan's Murodjon Akhmadaliev will be a revenge bout for Shiva as he lost in the Asian Championship semifinal last month to the Uzbek boxer. \n\nMeanwhile, Vikas Krishan's (75kg) hopes of winning his second medal at the mega event were washed away with 0-3 loss to Egypt's Hosam Abdin. \n\nSpeaking about his ward's performance, chief coach GS Sandhu said, \"We had high expectations from Vikas. He played well in the first two rounds but the decision didn't favour him. And pressure mounted in the third round,\" he said. \n\n\"But Shiva totally dominated his match with aggression. He used a combination of right straight and occasional upper cuts and played beautifully,\" he added. \n\nIn the Baku World Championship, four Indians including Vikas Krishan (69 kg), Jai Bhagwan (60 kg), Manoj Kumar (64 kg) and Devendro Singh (49kg) had booked their berths for the 2012 London Games. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:25:10.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
