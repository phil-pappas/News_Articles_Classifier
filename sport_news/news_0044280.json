There are seven seniors on our team who have been together for seven years and this year is what makes it all count.\" \nHouliston, who was selected Northern Kentucky Coaches Association Division II honorable mention all-star last season, underwent surgery for a torn labrum in her hip a few weeks after that initial visit, and after extensive therapy was able to return in time for the start of the regular season, which has two weeks left until postseason play begins. \nMcClung says he understands how important it is for high school athletes to be able to return as quickly as possible, because there are no redshirt years and playing at that age can mean so much. \n\"There's just such a limited amount of time for them to compete and they have put so much into it in both time and effort,\" said McClung, who said he had Tommy John surgery and two arthroscopic knee surgeries from injuries playing football and wrestling while in military school. \"It's not only an athletic endeavor for them, but it's also a huge social structure and outlet for them, as well. My job when they have an injury is get them in the day of or the next day, get them diagnosed, worked up and back on the road to recovery. This such a huge ordeal. It affects the whole family. It's such a difficult time for these kids.\" \nHouliston said her hip began hurting when she was in the eighth grade and the pain got progressively worse as she played not only in high school, but also for a competitive club team. It finally got to the point, she said, where it hurt to even sit down, but she was determined to finish her junior season before getting it looked at. \nAccording to McClung, it can often be difficult to diagnose the severity of a hip injury and that rehabbing it is often the first attempt at fixing it. \n\"Hip pathology can be elusive,\" he said. \"Many times injuries like this can go undetected. We were able to diagnose her right off the bat with a labral tear.\" \nHouliston couldn't put any weight on the hip for the first six weeks after the surgery and attended Highlands' state championship football game in December in Bowling Green with the aid of crutches. Even using crutches was an initial ordeal for her. \n\"The first day I was using them, I slipped on a wet floor and fell on my hip,\" she said. \"It freaked me out, but I got back up and realized I was going to be okay.\" \nThree months after the surgery she was able to use just one crutch and put a little more weight on the hip and finally got to begin rehabbing it in April. \nThe surgery and rehab prevented her from playing club volleyball. \n\"That was hard, because I hate missing games, but I knew I had to do everything in rehab to play this season,\" she said. \nAll the hard work in rehab paid off when she returned by the time the season started in early August. Returning for her senior season meant even more, because she doesn't plan to play in college. \n\"It means everything to make it back for this one last year,\" she said. \"I look back and there were a lot of times during rehab where I thought, 'I can't do this anymore.' Wanting to play one more year was the thing that motivated me.\" \nSeeing athletes like Houliston return is what motivates McClung as well. \n\"It's the whole reason I entered the career I'm in,\" he said. \"That's what makes it all worth it - to get them back to a competitive level and playing the sport they love. For me, it means everything.\" \nPhoto provided by Beacon Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
