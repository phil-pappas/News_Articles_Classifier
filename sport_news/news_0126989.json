Newark also greatly enhanced its chances of qualifying for the DIAA Division I state tournament. The Yellowjackets haven’t reached the postseason since 2007. \n“Second half, we made some adjustments and the guys responded,” Newark coach Diego Ruiz said. “They knew how big it was. They knew we haven’t been in this situation in eight years.” \nThe Cougars appeared ready to continue their mastery of the Yellowjackets when Edgar Rossier-Estrada scored off an assist by Edgardo Gutierrez for a 1-0 lead in the 23rd minute. \n“The first half, I thought we came out very flat-footed,” Ruiz said. “We had a week off, but hats off to Delcastle. I thought they were the better team in the first half.” \nNewark started to control possession in the second half, and it paid off in the 69th minute when a shot eluded Cougars goalkeeper Andres Trujillo-Cruz. As he scrambled to get back in position, the Yellowjackets’ Miguel Reyes slipped a pass to Maddyan Ata and the freshman drove it home to tie the game. \nIt stayed that way into the first overtime, when Trujillo-Cruz sprinted 20 yards out of his goal to snuff a breakaway before Newark’s Gimel Djan could fire. Then the Cougars generated an opportunity, only to see Rossier-Estrada shoot high from 25 yards out. \nDelcastle was pressing the attack six minutes into the second OT when Newark center back Daniel Addison broke up the play to set up a counter. The ball scooted ahead to Brandon Pellegrini, who had clear sailing with half a field to go. \nThe senior tried to steer around Trujillo-Cruz, but the Delcastle keeper forced him wide. Pellegrini chipped the ball into the middle from a sharp angle, and a Cougars defender got a foot on it in front of the goal. But Guzman was sprinting full speed, and he pounded it home to set off a wild celebration. \n“I was trying to go around him and score, but I went a little bit too far,” Pellegrini said. “So then I decided to pass the ball in the middle to my teammate Diego, and he scored a great goal.” \nThe Yellowjackets still have four games remaining, including a big one against third-ranked Charter of Wilmington in the regular-season finale on Nov. 5. But this was the one Newark needed most to boost its playoff chances. \n“It’s amazing to win a game like this and see that all the hard work you’ve put in, the two months of preseason and all the games coming up to this finally paid off,” Pellegrini said. \nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com .
