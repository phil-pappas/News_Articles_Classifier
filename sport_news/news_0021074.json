Last among the Chase drivers and a whopping 32 points behind bubble man Keselowski, the Joe Gibbs Racing driver at the very least needs to knock a significance chunk off his deficit to have any chance of advancing -- assuming he doesn't win at Talladega next weekend. \nLong known as a driver who doesn't get easily rattled, Kenseth -- at least outwardly -- is projecting a calmness despite facing the very real possibility of elimination next weekend. \nA winner of a series-high five races in 2015, the veteran driver seems to find comfort in knowing that the bad luck he faced at Charlotte could find someone else at Kansas, Talladega or both. And that, at least in theory, would give the 2003 Sprint Cup champion a better chance of advancing. \n\"If it happened to us in one race; it can happen to anybody in this race or the next race,\" said Kenseth, who rolls off 11th on Sunday. \"I really haven't thought about it a lot. I got through last weekend and went through and worked on closing Charlotte down on Monday and kind of went through all our notes on what went wrong and what went right, what we did good and what we need to do better. Just all the normal stuff.\" \nBusch, meanwhile, is only 10 points off the bubble spot -- a much better position to be in than that of Earnhardt and Kenseth. However, unlike Kenseth and Earnhardt, who traditionally run well at Kansas, the 1.5-mile track has been downright unkind to Busch -- at least on the Sprint Cup side. \nAside from having nary a win at Kansas, the Joe Gibbs Racing driver has finished in the top five here just once in 15 starts. Though the record is dismal, Busch gleans some hope from winning Saturday's XFINITY Series race here and the fact that the last time he drove a Sprint Cup car at Kansas -- one year ago -- he finished a career-best third. \n\"To win here in the XFINITY Series, it does bode your confidence a little bit, it gives you a little bit of good feeling for going into tomorrow's race,\" Busch, who starts third on Sunday, said after Saturday's XFINITY win. \"Our Cup car was really not very good all day today and we kind of struggled with it and we've got our work cut out for us tomorrow, but I'm sure the things I talked with Adam (Stevens, Cup crew chief) after practice and stuff, hopefully he can fix those things. If he fixes my problems, then I think we'll have a decent day.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:07:15.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
