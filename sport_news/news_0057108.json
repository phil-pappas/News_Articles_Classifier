Calgary Flames forward Sam Bennett reported to rookie camp with 12 NHL games under his belt and he says he wants to be a full-time player in 2015-16. First Bennett will face his buddy Connor McDavid in a rookie tournament.

Evgeny Kuznetsov chipped in with three assists. The Capitals were playing their first road game of the year. Their three-game trek through Western Canada continues Thursday in Vancouver. \nSean Monahan and Mark Giordano scored for Calgary (1-5-0), which has opened with four straight losses on home ice for the first time in franchise history. \nTwo points through six games also equals the club’s worst overall start. In 1997-98, Calgary began the season 0-4-2. \nAhead by one, the Caps extended their cushion to 4-1 halfway through the second on goals 41 seconds apart by Backstrom and Oshie. \nFirst, Justin Williams — with all five Flames skaters affixed on him behind the net — fed the puck to an uncovered Backstrom in the slot and he hammered a one-timer past Ramo. \nThen Oshie drove to the top of the crease, knocked Dougie Hamilton out of the way with a hit, and promptly converted Kuznetsov’s centring pass before Hamilton could recover. \nThat goal ended the night for Ramo, who exited with 14 saves on 18 shots. He was replaced by Jonas Hiller, who would finish the night having surrendered two goals against on 12 shots. \nThe Flames continue to look for answers in net. Ramo and Hiller have split the first six games so far and both have struggled. Calgary is carrying three goalies, with 24-year-old Joni Ortio also on the roster. \nBraden Holtby, in his fifth straight start, had 17 stops to get the victory for Washington. \nAfter Monahan put the Flames on the scoreboard nine minutes into the first period, Burakovky tied it thanks to a set-up from Kuznetsov, who stripped the puck from Dennis Wideman. \nNotes: Calgary C Joe Colborne (broken thumb) returned after missing the season’s first give games... Ortio has yet to even dress as the back-up.
