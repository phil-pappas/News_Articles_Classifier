The Giants averaged just 1.1 yard per play on their four possessions following those giveaways. Registered just one first down on those four possessions. The Eagles' 14 giveaways in the first six games are the second most in the league. Only 1-5 Detroit has more (18). But the defense has refused to allow opponents to take advantage of those gifts. They've given up just 21 points off those 14 giveaways. That's 1.5 points per turnover. Last year, the Eagles allowed 3.1 points per turnover. The year before, they gave up 2.7.\n70.1 That's Eli Manning's passer rating in his five starts against Bill Davis' defense. Manning came into the game as one of the league's hottest passers. Ten TDs, just two interceptions, only four sacks and a 100.2 passer rating. But the Eagles threw a few coverages at him that they hadn't shown before, forced him to hang on to the ball a little longer than he wanted and were in his face much of the night. He was sacked three times, hurried on numerous other occasions, threw two interceptions and ended up with a 62.3 passer rating. Manning and the Giants now have lost four of five to the Eagles since Chip Kelly replaced Andy Reid.\n4 The number of giveaways by the Eagles Monday, including three interceptions by Sam Bradford. It was only the second time in Bradford's career that he has thrown three picks in a game. The first time? His very first game as a rookie in 2010. Anyway, Monday was the 12th time the Chip Kelly-coached Eagles have had three or more giveaways in a game, and the eighth time in the last 19 games. Usually, teams that turn the ball over four times in a game are going to lose. The Eagles are 4-8 in those 12 games, including a 20-10 Week 2 loss to the Cowboys.\n48.5 More coverage VOTE: How many times will Eagles sack Newton? Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone! FORUMS: Will the Eagles make the playoffs? Latest NFL odds SHOP: Eagles Training Camp sportswear Is Sam Bradford a Super Bowl-caliber quarterback? Yes No View results Sam Bradford's third-down passer rating in the first six games. The Eagles converted a season-high 37.5 percent of their third-down opportunities (6-for-16) against the Giants, which is more a condemnation of how bad they've been on third down this season than a sign of a job-well-done. Bradford again was largely ineffective throwing the football on third down. He was 6-for-11 for just 46 yards and an interception. He threw for three first downs on third down, but two of them came in the final 18 minutes when the Eagles had a 17-point lead. He is 30th in the league in third-down passing. His 4.00 yards-per-attempt average on third down is the worst in the league. The only guy with a lower third-down completion percentage than Bradford (46.4) is Jacksonville's Blake Bortles (44.8). His coach probably is going to be getting fired at the end of the season.\n2 Two of the Eagles' three sacks of Eli Manning came on third down. That's one more third-down sack than they had in the first five games. Vinny Curry beat RG Geoff Schwartz and sacked Manning for a nine-yard loss on a third-and-7 play in the second quarter, forcing the Giants to punt. Then, early in the third quarter, with the Eagles up by just 10, Fletcher Cox continued his season-long domination of opposing offensive linemen, sacking Manning on a third-and-10 near midfield and forcing a fumble. Manning completed seven of 10 third-down passes, but for just 43 yards. He threw for just one first down on third down in the second half and that came with 5 1/2 minutes left in an already-lost game.", "external_links": ["http://polls.clickability.com/polls", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:14:43.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
