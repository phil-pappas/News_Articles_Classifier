Comment   Staff Reports Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 10:00 AM By Staff Reports Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 10:00 AM JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. An interim committee in the Missouri House will take a look at the progress made by the Missouri State High School Activities Association (MSHSAA) in implementing recommendations made by a separate interim committee in 2007. State Rep. Steve Cookson (R-Poplar Bluff) will serve as the chairman of the committee that was formed by House Speaker Todd Richardson. Cookson said the committee hopes to track and compare the progress of previously recommended MSHSAA reforms outlined in the report issued by the 2007 interim committee on MSHSAA reform. The current committee will focus on these key areas in its investigation: • MSHSAA’s financial audits of receipts and expenditures, • MSHSAA’s compliance with Sunshine Laws and transparency of activities, • MSHSAA’s fairness and consistency in its application of their constitution, bylaws, and board rules and regulations, • MSHSAA’s compliance and role in insuring student safety, and • Any other issues that may arise. “My hope is that representatives from MSHSAA will be fully compliant in answering our questions and providing the information we need to fully assess how effective they have been in implementing the suggested changes,” said Cookson. “As the organization that oversees all high school activities in the state, it is important to ensure MSHSAA is acting in a transparent and accountable way that protects the best interests of our young people.” MSHSAA is the governing body for high school activities throughout the state of Missouri. Approximately 580 high schools are members of MSHSAA. Other members of the interim committee include: Reps. Elijah Haahr - vice chair, Don Rone, Dan Shaul, Kirk Mathews, Bryan Spencer, Jay Barnes, Wanda Brown, Rebecca Roeber, Kurt Bahr, Andrew Koenig, Paul Fitzwater, Lyle Rowland, Pat Conway, Brandon Ellington, Ira Anders, Margo McNeil, Gina Mitten and Joe Runions. The committee will hold its first hearings at the Missouri Capitol inJefferson City Wednesday, Oct. 28, and Thursday, Oct. 29, at 9 a.m. each day in the House Hearing Room 3. Members of the public are invited to attend to offer their input and testimony.
