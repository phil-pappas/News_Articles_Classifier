Facing a soft Bears secondary, he’s the perfect bye week filler for Tom Brady.\nBills RB Karlos Williams vs. NYG — Shady McCoy will miss Sunday’s game against the Giants and Williams is the only back to score in every game this season.\nFalcons RB Devonta Freeman vs. Texans — With Coleman out, the healthy amount of carries should give the Atlanta back a good shot at the end zone.\nJaguars RB T.J. Yeldon at Colts — He’s looked great this season, just not on your fantasy roster. That trend should change against a bad Colts ‘D’ this weekend.\nBills TE Charles Clay vs. NYG — Perfect fill-in for Gronk; has reached paydirt last two games.\nPackers WR James Jones at 49ers — Devante Adams might not play and even if he does, Jones is the clear No.2 and main red zone target for Aaron Rodgers. Duds\n49ers RB Carlos Hyde vs. Packers — He’s fallen victim to his team having to chuck it after getting behind. Trend will continue against the Packers.\nBengals RB Jeremy Hill vs. Chiefs — He will shake out of this funk, but probably not this week.\nSeahawks RB Marshawn Lynch vs. Lions — He’s 50/50 to play this weekend and even if he does, he probably won’t be Beast-Mode. Grab Thomas Rawls.\nBills WR Sammy Watkins vs. NYG — Has been hit or miss this year and thanks to a calf injury, Rex Ryan ruled him out early.\nVikings QB Teddy Bridgewater at Broncos — Going up against the arguably the best defense in the NFL, he’s not the best bye week fill in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:23:16.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
