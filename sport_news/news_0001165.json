Photograph by: DARRYL DYCK , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nThere’s only so much you can do about Jay Beagle. But even beyond him, the Washington Capitals have a depot of firepower. They do not need help scoring. \nThe Vancouver Canucks gave them plenty of help anyway. \nWinger Radim Vrbata blemished his fine night by turning the puck over before the tying goal. Canuck defenceman Alex Edler was beaten by a deflected stretch pass on Alex Ovechkin’s winning goal — a partially whiffed shot on a 2-on-1 that arced over goalie Ryan Miller. \nThese were largely unforced errors Thursday that took the Canucks way beyond the margin of error between winning and losing in the National Hockey League. For the fourth time in four home games this season, the Canucks lost, beaten 3-2 by the potent Capitals after Vancouver took a 2-1 lead into the third period at Rogers Arena. \nIt was Washington’s first win here since Valentine’s Day in 2001 — 4½ years before Ovechkin came to the NHL from Russia and became the most dangerous goal-scorer of his generation. \nIt seems nearly that long since the Canucks, now 3-2-2 after a 3-0-1 start to the season, last won at home. \n“In this league, if you look at the stats being up after two periods, the great teams usually never lose those games,” Canuck captain Henrik Sedin said. “We have to look at this and get better. We have a team that can win these games, but it’s two or three mistakes and they cost us. Look at their lineup; they have three lines that are dangerous off the rush. We kept feeding them. If you give them enough, they’re going to score. Four minutes left, you can’t give them a 2-on-1. That’s costly.” \nFor a while it looked like Beagle, whose 23 goals over the previous five seasons is roughly equivalent to about three months of production for Ovechkin, might beat the Canucks. He beautifully set up Washington’s first goal and luckily scored the tying one at 5:42 of the third period. Instead, it was Ovechkin who won it with his fluttering one-timer from the slot after Dmitry Orlov’s stretch pass to Evgeny Kuznetsov marooned the Canucks’ Edler. \n“He rainbowed it and hit the bar on the way down, I think,” Canuck goalie Ryan Miller said. “He whiffed. He swung fully on it. We know it’s Ovechkin; we’re going to shade (toward him). The pass probably wasn’t in his wheelhouse, but with Ovechkin, he gets himself around on everything. He rainbowed it. I would have had to be standing to get it and that’s not realistic.” \nBut should the Canucks surrender a 2-on-1 with Ovechkin on the ice late in the third period of a tie game? \n“At that point in the third period — we’d played a hard game — maybe need a little bit better awareness,” Miller said. “A heads-up play by them.” \nEdler said of the stretch pass that allowed Kuznetsov to get behind him: “I think it hit something. I felt like I was in the passing lane. In the end, it was my guy who got the puck and I’ve got to make sure I’m on the right side of him. Ovechkin is a guy that whether he’s playing good or not throughout the game, when he gets the puck he’s dangerous wherever he is. It’s definitely something that shouldn’t happen. You can’t give him a 2-on-1 at the end of the game like that.” \nBeagle tied the game with a greasy deflection — or bounce — from John Carlson’s point shot after Vrbata, who had a goal and assist for the Canucks, inexplicably dropped a blind pass behind his net to Capital Marcus Johansson. \n“I thought somebody called a reverse,” Vrbata said. “I thought it was one of our D. I guess it was somebody from them and it just went from there. It’s too bad we couldn’t hold the lead. Tough, tough loss. It’s a fine line between winning and losing, and we’re learning the hard way so far, at home especially.” \nAfter Jason Chimera easily beat Matt Bartkowski’s check to convert Beagle’s goalmouth pass and make it 1-0 at 15:10 of the first period, Vrbata tied it at 4:14 of the second when he skated to the edge of the crease in time for Sedin’s centring pass to bounce in off him. Sedin put the Canucks ahead on a power play at 14:01, squeezing a sharp-angle shot past the left pad of Capitals goalie Braden Holtby. \nAt that point, Ovechkin was hardly in the game. \n“If he gets a clean swing on it, maybe he still scores anyway,” Miller said of the winner. “But it doesn’t feel good to have a guy misfire and it rainbows over your head.” \nSomewhere over the rainbow, skies aren’t blue. \nimacintyre@vancouversun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:28:14.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
