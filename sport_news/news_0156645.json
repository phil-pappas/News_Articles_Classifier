(AP) — Will Grier was sick all right. \nHe was downright nasty. \nGrier threw four touchdown passes to four receivers — all in the first half — and No. 23 Florida upset No. 5 Mississippi 38-10 on Saturday night to give coach Jim McElwain a signature win in his first season in Gainesville. \nGrier battled a stomach virus for two days before the game, feeling so ill that the Gators (5-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) thought there was a chance Treon Harris might get the nod. Grier started anyway and was sharper than ever. \nThe freshman completed 24 of 29 passes for 271 yards against the Rebels (4-1, 2-1). He was poised in the pocket, precise with every throw and even closer to perfect than he was down the stretch against Tennessee last week. College football's Week 5 winners and losers \nGrier's start was the difference in the latest victory. His four-touchdown first half gave him six TD passes in his last three quarters. \nWith All-American Robert Nkemdiche draped all over him, Grier found Demarcus Robinson on a 36-yard score in the first quarter. He hooked up with Jake McGee for a 2-yard score a few minutes later, five plays after Ole Miss running back Jaylen Walton fumbled. \nGrier added two more TD passes in the second quarter, beating a third-down blitz with a quick slant to Brandon Powell. Powell slipped a tackle and outran two defenders down the sideline for a 77-yarder. Grier added a 15-yarder to Antonio Callaway, the hero of last week's come-from-behind victory against the Volunteers, with 20 seconds remaining in the half. \nIn the span of two games and three quarters, Grier completed 28 of 37 passes for 370 yards and six touchdowns — and no turnovers. \nHe got plenty of help in both games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:27:37.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
