(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register) Buy Photo \n1. DOWLING CATHOLIC (8-0) \nLast week: 1 \nThe two-time defending champions are favorites in Class 4A yet again. Close calls in non-district play have been replaced by the dominant Dowling offense and athletic defense opponents have come to expect. They forced seven turnovers in Friday's win over Des Moines North and get to try and top it with Des Moines Lincoln (4-5) in the first round. \n2. CEDAR RAPIDS KENNEDY (9-0) \nLast week: 2 \nWaterloo West scored 13 points on Friday, becoming the first team since Week 2 to score double digits on Kennedy's defense. There was more than enough offensive support to cover up the mini-lapse, with 344 rushing yards and two passing scores from Nick Duehr. Last year's 3-8 finish feels like a long time ago. \n3. BETTENDORF (9-0) \nLast week: 3 \nThe Bulldogs are unbeaten and on the trail towards another UNI-Dome appearance. Scoring 60 points in Week 9 is an effective way to charge into the postseason, and six touchdowns came through the balanced run game. Dax Emerson had three scores on five carries against Davenport West, the kind of efficiency that can carry Bettendorf through a lopsided first-round game with Davenport North (1-8). \n4. CEDAR RAPIDS WASHINGTON (8-1) \nLast week: 4 \nThe 4A runner-up in 2014 has won seven straight games, the latest a complete 48-0 win over Burlington. Washington is getting hot at the right time too, returning quarterback T.J. Vogel from injury and still splitting carries successfully between Tavian Patrick and Johnny Dobbs. Cedar Falls (6-3) could provide a strong first-round challenge at Kingston Stadium. \n5. PELLA (9-0) \nLast week: 5 \nClass 3A's defending champions are crushing the competition and riding a 23-game winning streak into the playoffs. Pella outscored four opponents by 185 points in October, with a 50-pointer coming over Chariton on Friday. The run game and defense have too much firepower for most squads, and Fairfield (4-5) is next. \n6. WAUKEE (7-2) \nLast week: 6 \nWinners of six straight, the Warriors showed flashes of last season's high level in district play. A 40-16 win at Mason City clinched first place in a difficult race, but the three wins before it — Urbandale, Indianola and Fort Dodge — should be the best preparation for quick turnarounds in the playoffs. \n7. ANKENY (8-1) \nLast week: 8 \nThe only team to rise in this week's Super 10 ripped off a definitive and important win at Southeast Polk on Friday. Coach Rick Nelson's club won its seventh in a row by slowing down an offense that averaged 40-plus points for the last month, and earned first place against its old coach. \n8. WEST DELAWARE (9-0) \nLast week: 7 \nPick your poison when it comes to taking on the powerful Hawks. Both lines are sizable and strong, paving the way for Coy Roussell on offense and refusing to be broken on defense. Four different players rushed for touchdowns in Week 9 against Decorah, including Roussell, and Benton (5-4) has to decide the best way to slow them down in the first round. \n9. W.D.M. VALLEY (7-2) \nLast week: 9 \nIt's no fun playing Valley after it loses. After a Week 4 loss to Dowling, the Tigers put 62 points on Hoover to signal their intentions in district play. Following an upset loss to Ankeny Centennial in Week 8, coach Gary Swenson's squad beat Lincoln, 76-6. The only mistake may have been Cole Hahn's missed PAT; the junior finished an excellent 10-of-11. \n10. ALBIA (9-0) \nLast week: 10 \nThe top team in Class 2A has finished every game this season with a continuous clock. Iowa Falls-Alden (4-5) is the first-round foe to try and stop that run, but they'll soon see the fast and physical squad an entire district has been unable to sort out. Albia's Week 9 win was a 50-0 rout over Clarke, and the Demons should be playing at home for the foreseeable future. \nStarting in the 2015 season, The Register is ranking the best football teams in Iowa, regardless of class and school size.
