No need to look over your shoulder and all.\nEven young players realize how tough it is to play too much, though.\nLast season LSU got plenty of production from the quartet of guards, all four of whom came up big in different ways and at different times during a 22-11 season that ended with a first-round loss in the NCAA Tournament.\nAs the season wore on, though, and especially late in high-intensity close games -- a Tiger staple a year ago -- wear-and-tear started to surface.\nThe numbers explain why: Of a possible 51 games from January on, the three guards who wound up as the starting backcourt down the stretch played 30-plus minutes 44 times.\nThat was similar to the time that big men Jarell Martin and Jordan Mickey were logging as LSU basically played with six players most of the last third of the season. By the end of the season, four Tiger starters averaged 33.6 minutes a game.\nThings are different now.\nDepth at guard is a nice new element for LSU coach Johny Jones | Video The Tigers have six players in the backcourt, four who started several games each last season, vying for playing time\nMartin and Mickey left for the NBA Draft, but all four guards are back and the Tigers will integrate a talented four-man quartet that features two high-profile guards with versatility: Antonio Blakeney and Brandon Sampson .\nSo far the result in the first week of pre-season practice for the 2015-16 season has been a ratcheted-up level of competition among the six guards for minutes, mixed with a chance for the coaches and players to get familiar with different combinations.\n\"It's a lot different than last year,\" said senior Keith Hornsby , who produced 13.4 points a game and led the team with 72 3-pointers made and 39.3% marksmanship from outside the arc.\n\"It's up to the coaches to decide how to divide (playing time) up. On really good teams, you don't have five players playing 36 minutes a game -- you have a lot of depth and then you get to go out there and give it your all for as long as you can and then rest.\n\"Our energy and confidence has only increased because we have such high expectations. We know everybody around us is so excited about the season, so it's been really focused and we're really competing against each other.\"\nThat word -- competition -- is squarely at the heart of pre-season work because all six of the guards offer up the flexibility to give Johnny Jones and his staff some intriguing chess pieces to move around.\nLSU freshman Brandon Sampson (left) and sophomore Jalyn Patterson work on drills as 4th-year Tigers coach Johnny Jones looks on. LSUSports.net Tim Quarterman, Jalyn Patterson and Josh Gray can all operate as the lead guard. At 6-foot-6, Quarterman can also slide to a small forward spot, as can the 6-5 Sampson and 6-4 Blakeney.\nHornsby, Patterson, Sampson and Blakeney are all 3-point shooting threats and Quarterman can bury them when he is set up well. Patterson drained 44 treys as a freshman.\nWhen mixed with the way 6-foot-10 phenom Benny Simmons can play, there is a lot of validity to the growing notion that LSU will play up-tempo, positionless basketball pretty often this season.\nLSU freshman Antonio Blakeney could be a high-volume scorer for the Tigers this season. LSUSports.net There are certainly some areas where each of the six guards can get better, especially on defense.\n\"It's good having guys that are very capable ball-handlers, scorers and guys that are real threats out there on the floor and can play multiple positions,\" Jones said. \"That helps, especially with this team.\n\"It gives us a certain amount of depth. Sometimes you can have the bodies, but some guys have the limitations or are doing other things.\"\nDuring a 10-practice window before the Tigers went to Australia for a five-game exhibition tour, most of the focus was on getting players comfortable on the offensive of the floor.\nThat leaves plenty of room for growth on defense, which has been in the spotlight the first week of work. Quarterman and Patterson are LSU's best defenders in the backcourt, and Hornsby proved capable of holding his own.\n\"As a small guard, coaches always told me if I wanted to play, I had to play defense, so I took the attitude that when I stepped on the court, I had to be the kind of defender they wanted me to be,\" said Patterson, the smallest Tiger guard at 6-1.\nIt's that kind of motivation that is the thread connecting the Tiger guards so far.\nWhatever skill set each one brings is the first step.\nAdding on to become more a more viable option and give Jones and his coaches tougher decisions -- that's why things are so spirited.\nEarly-season practice is accelerated at LSU because of summer tour, Keith Hornsby says | Video The Tigers got 10 practice days before they left for a five-game exhibition tour\n\"You have to go out, stay focused, listen to the coaches and play hard,\" Quarterman said. He and Darcy Malone are the only Tigers who have been around and have played in an LSU uniform the last two years. There's a lot competing going right now. Nobody wants to be the man to have the dropoff or be left on the bench.\"\nGoing there for a breather, now that's OK once in a while.\n\"Having more depth like we do now, that's only going to make us a better team,\" Quarterman said. \"We know we have a chance to be special this season and having more guys who can step in there and play is a big reason why.\"\nNow at the right size, Elbert Robinson hopes to find the right place\nSimmons and LSU prominent in Athlon's pre-season magazine\n2014-15 statistics\n2015-16 schedule", "external_links": ["http://www.lsusports.net/SportSelect.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=5200&SPID=2166&SPSID=27828", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/227531779&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false", "http://www.lsusports.net/fls/5200/assets/docs/mb/15stats/teamcume.htm"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:40:16.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
