Yoenis Cespedes, their star slugger, left the game in the second inning with a sore left shoulder. The severity of the injury and how it occurred were not immediately clear, Manager Terry Collins said during an in-game interview on TBS.\nSpeculation swirled after the injury because Cespedes had been spotted playing golf at a Chicago-area course earlier in the day, according to a report from a local NBC affiliate.

And right now, on this stage, he’s starting to show it off.”\nCespedes will have five days off before the World Series begins on Tuesday.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/21METS2-hp/21METS2-hp-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/sports/BLOGMETSSTUDS/BLOGMETSSTUDS-thumbStandard-v2.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:59:11.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
