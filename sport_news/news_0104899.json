By Seattle Times staff The Seattle Times \nCarolina (4-0 and coming off a bye) is one of six remaining undefeated teams in the NFL but might be the least-feared of the bunch, having defeated opponents with a total record of 5-15. Still, the Panthers also have made the playoffs the past two seasons under coach Ron Rivera and feature maybe the best dual-threat quarterback east of Seattle in Cam Newton and a rugged defense that will be fortified by the return of middle linebacker Luke Kuechly, has missed the past three games because of a concussion. The Panthers lead the NFL in turnover margin at plus-8 and rank among the top half of the NFL in just about every significant defensive category, including fourth in points allowed at 17.8. They’ve also had one of the better rushing games in the NFL led by Newton and former University of Oregon and Timberline High School star Jonathan Stewart, ranking fourth in rushing at 132.3 per game.
