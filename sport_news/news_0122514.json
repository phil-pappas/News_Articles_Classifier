(Photo: Gary A. Vasquez, Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports) \nMickey Scodova's ears keep waiting for the phone call his broken heart knows isn't coming. \n\"He'd call me at 6 in the morning and say 'You've got to get moving!'\" the Mansfield gym owner and trainer said, describing Dean Chance's habit of calling him several times each day. \nOne of those calls came last week when Chance's car stopped running. When Scodova arrived to help the 1964 Cy Young Award winner, he noticed the car was crammed with groceries. Chance was assisting the family of a football player at Northwestern High School — his alma mater — who recently suffered a stroke after a violent collision on the field. \nThat's a side of Dean Chance you won't see on one of his baseball cards, a side Scodova saw often during their friendship of more than 20 years. Chance passed away Sunday morning at age 74, his body discovered in the farmhouse where he lived alone, not far from where he grew up just outside of Wooster. \n\"He did a lot for the (Wayne County) community that people didn't even know about,\" Scodova said. \"He always gave me good advice: Surround yourself with good people. You're only as good as your friends, so have good friends. He was a good friend.\" \nThere wasn't a presumptuous bone in Chance's body. Arguably the best schoolboy pitcher ever in Ohio, Chance pitched 11 years in the major leagues and probably would be in the Hall of Fame today had he received more hitting support from his teammates. As it was, he won 20 games twice, threw 33 shutouts, pitched a complete game no-hitter just 19 days after hurling a rain-shortened perfect game, sported a career ERA of 2.92 and in 1964 became the youngest Cy Young winner — emblematic of baseball's best pitcher — at age 23. \nBut Chance didn't flaunt his success. He had a trophy and memorabilia case in his home, but it was tucked away in his basement. His Cy Young Award hung crookedly on a single nail in his living room. He couldn't be bothered with straightening it or worrying about someone stealing it from his unlocked home in the country. \nHe had two recliners positioned next to phones in his living room. One day three years ago he said he had a treat for me. He told me to sit down and pick up the extension while he dialed a number from the other chair. \n\"Hey, Mamie,\" he said, giving me a wink. \" I want you to say hi to Jon Spencer.\" \nOn the other end was Fifties and Sixties platinum blonde pinup queen Mamie Van Doren, proud member of the \"Three Ms\" sorority with bombshells Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield. We talked for several minutes, mainly about her movies and, with Chance egging her on, her relationship with Joe Namath. (Don't ask.) \nAs the star pitcher with leading man looks, Chance hobnobbed with Hollywood celebrities like Ann-Margret, Angie Dickinson, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant, Dean Martin, Doris Day and Walt Disney during his stint with the Los Angeles Angels. In the hallway of his house were framed photos of Chance with A-listers and one where he and roommate Bo Belinsky flanked FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. \nChance would pal around with Mamie and Belinsky, her boyfriend. Belinsky threw a no-hitter, but couldn't keep pace with Chance on the mound any more than Chance could keep up with Belinsky's amorous adventures off the field. \nChance joked that he didn't room with Bo, he roomed with Bo's suitcase. \n\"Dean's an old farmer,\" Mamie said during our conversation. \"I came from the Midwest, so I grew up around guys like him. He was like an uncle, like a brother.\" \nShe was kidding. \n\"Truthfully, he was mischievous as hell,\" she said. \"You can't be a sweetie pie and throw those pitches he threw.\" \nHis fastball was scary good and Chance was scary, period, because he turned his back to hitters with a corkscrew delivery, making them more wary by confessing it didn't matter if he watched what he was doing because \"I don't see well out of my left eye anyhow.\" \nScodova knew better than anyone how to push Chance's buttons. \n\"I'd ask, 'What about Richie Allen?'\" Scodova said, referring to the former Phillies' slugger. \"Why did you throw that slow curveball to him? That ball is still in orbit.' He'd go crazy.\" \nOne time, Scodova attended a card show with Chance and close friend Denny McLain, the last pitcher to win 30 games in a season when he finished 31-6 for the 1968 Detroit Tigers. The girl at the door didn't recognize Chance so she charged him admission. \n\"We sat down and the girl comes over and apologizes for making Dean pay,\" Scodova said. \"McLain told her not to worry about it. 'I've won two Cy Youngs and he's only won one.' I about fell over.\" \nChance was inducted into the Angels' Hall of Fame on Aug. 22, but I sensed that nothing made him prouder than being elected into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame last year, maybe because it validated him as an all-around athlete. Some believe he was just as good in his other sport. \nHe led Northwestern to a state basketball title and a state baseball title. \n\"You could put a basketball in his hands and he'd be just as good (as in baseball),\" long-time friend Charlie Farrell told me a few years back. \"I remember the cops in the Canton Fieldhouse cheering for him, and they probably never heard of him until that night. It didn't matter where they threw the ball to Dean ... swish.\" \nAlthough he played for five teams in the majors, including the Indians, Chance never ventured far from his roots. He drove me around New Pittsburg, the hamlet where he lived, showing me the 300 acres he leased for farming, his 50 head of Angus and two houses he fixed up as rental properties. \nThat field trip was as far removed from LaLa Land as you can imagine. And yet Chance was a natural fit in both places, whether he was pitching for the Angels or pitching in for his hometown. \nThe Los Angeles Times story posted in the wake of his death mentioned how different Wooster-area groups vied to sponsor a testimonial dinner after he won the Cy Young. Chance said he would only go along with the plan if proceeds went to his alma mater. That's how Northwestern High School raised money to start its football program. \nThere are other stories like that about his benevolence, with Scodova around for most of them. They met through their passion for boxing. Scodova is a trainer/manager and Chance, who ran a boxing gym in Akron during his last couple of years in the majors, would go on to become the founder and president of the International Boxing Association. Scodova trained local IBA champion Marc Salser. \nChance, Belinsky and Van Doren attended boxing shows together at L.A.'s legendary Olympic Auditorium, which fed Chance's interest in the sport. He and Scodova traveled everywhere from Texas to New York, with Chance promoting shows and Scodova helping to fill the fight cards. \n\"Dean was loyal to people who were straight-shooters,\" Scodova said. \"You don't see that much anymore. If he said he'd get something done, he'd get it done. \n\"He had a helluva run.\" \njspencer@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:15:48.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
