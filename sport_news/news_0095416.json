For the second straight day, the Mets have pushed back the first-year pitcher, who is dealing with back stiffness.\nAdChoices The latest setback now leaves the lefty's status in limbo for the week and postseason. He'll undergo medical test before determining if he can make another appearance this season. While Matz originally was slotted into the playoff rotation plans as the fourth starter, Bartolo Colon could receive the starting spot instead.\nOn Tuesday, the 24-year-old southpaw woke up with back discomfort, and now the issue has seemingly turned from not serious to potentially problematic. Sporting a 2.27 ERA through six starts, the rookie would round out a loaded batch of young aces, but the team also must be cautious with such a promising pitcher.\nAs for Thursday, either Tim Stauffer or Sean Gilmartin is expected to make the start against the Philadelphia Phillies in Matz's place. It'd mark the season's first start for either left-handed reliever.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/4260/tim-stauffer", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/721/bartolo-colon", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/new-york-mets", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/philadelphia-phillies", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/107666/sean-gilmartin", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/244785/steven-matz", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:28:51.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
