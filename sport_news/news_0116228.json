Injuries have forced EJ Manuel back into the starting lineup for the Buffalo Bills , and he now gets a chance to start while Doug Marrone, the man that benched him a year ago, stands on the other sideline for the Jacksonville Jaguars. \nManuel, the Bills’ 2013 first-round pick, had a lot of time to sit and watch. He was passed over by three different quarterbacks, but he’s back in the lineup for a game that will be streamed internationally and played at Wembley Stadium in London. Despite all the eyes on the game, Marrone’s might mean a bit more. Manuel won’t be matched up against Marrone, who coaches offensive line for the Jaguars. But he will have a chance to where he’s come since his old head coach, who opted out of his contract with the Bills, wrote him off four games into the 2014 season. \nMaybe the storyline is overblown. Maybe it doesn’t mean much to Manuel. But if he’s able to put on a show, this wouldn’t be the worst week for him to do it. \nPhotos by The Associated Press 1. Can LeSean McCoy carry the offense? \nLeSean McCoy is the Buffalo Bills’ highest-paid offensive player, and Sunday would be the perfect time for him live up to the paycheck. The Bills will be down two offensive linemen, their starting quarterback and their top two receivers. McCoy is closer to 100 percent coming off the hamstring injury and should be able to handle close to a full workload. The Bills will certainly need him. 2. The right side of the offensive line \nThe Bills are going to be without starting right tackle Seantrel Henderson (concussion) and starting right guard John Miller, who had a death in the family. That leaves them with Cyrus Kouandjio (71) making his first career start at right tackle and Kraig Urbik filling in at right guard. That’s not the ideal offensive line combination for the Bills, but luckily they will be playing a Jacksonville defensive line that lacks playmakers on the edge. That matchup will be an interesting one to follow. 3. Bills defense vs. Blake Bortles \nThe Bills’ defense has come under heavy scrutiny after a tough loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. If ever there was a game for Rex Ryan’s defense to get back to its aggressive ways, this week could be it. Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles is prone to mistakes, so he could a quarterback Buffalo is able to take advantage of. The Jaguars’ offensive line hasn’t been great, so the Bills’ front four should be able to get back on track. 4. Bills wide receiver depth \nThe Bills’ passing game is going to be tested Sunday. Not only is Tyrod Taylor again out, but so too are Sammy Watkins and Percy Harvin. The Jaguars have been dreadful against the pass, but the Bills will be playing with Robert Woods, left, and Chris Hogan as their top two receivers in this game. That could force Manuel to involve tight ends Charles Clay and Chris Gragg in the passing game. This offense certainly won’t look like it did at the beginning of the season. 5. The atmosphere \nFor as underwhelming a matchup as this is on paper, let’s not forget the Bills are playing in London. Not every team gets this opportunity, and it should be a memorable one for the fans that make the trip. These games have attracted large crowds in the past, and the Bills will get a chance to showcase themselves on an international stage. That is both an exciting and terrifying thought depending on your level of optimism. ‹ ›", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:17:50.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
