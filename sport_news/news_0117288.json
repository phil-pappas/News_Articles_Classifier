There are four races left for me to get this championship tied up and as long as it's done by the time I cross the line in Abu Dhabi that's what really counts. \n\"I'm excited to get out there, give my best and if I can come away with a third Stetson hat that would be unbelievable.\" \nHamilton's record in the United States - and North America in general - certainly suggests the Briton will again be a difficult driver to beat. In four previous US GPs, one at Indianapolis in 2007 and the last three years at the Circuit of the Americas, Hamilton has won three times, while his CV also includes four victories in neighbouring Canada. \n[Austin] is definitely one of the highlights of the year for me,\" he added. \"I love the States and spend a lot of time over there, so it's a weekend I always look forward to.\" \nTeammate Nico Rosberg's aspirations of a first world championship, meanwhile, now almost certainly have to wait until at least 2016 after his retirement in Russia all but knocked him out of the title race. \nThe German, who trails Hamilton by 73 points with just 100 to play for, has nonetheless outqualifed the sister car in the last two races and hopes to end the season by adding to his tally of three 2015 race wins. \n\"With four races left and a big gap to Lewis, it's clear that the title is a long shot for me now. But it's not in me to give up or back down, so I'll be pushing flat out to the end and hopefully having some fun out there in the final few rounds this year,\" Rosberg said. \n\"I really want to enjoy the next races, as our Silver Arrow is such a great car and gives me the chance to end the year with a few more wins.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:12:58.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
