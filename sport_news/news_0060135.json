Because she only had three legs, Churchill said, there were worries about her ability to find food with the current food shortage.\nCPW officers tried to capture the bear and relocate it but were unsuccessful. Eventually, they decided to put her down.\n\"They were just really worried (capturing her) would be delaying the inevitable,\" Churchill said.\nGolden police posted photos of the bear on Facebook Wednesday afternoon. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office says it has been watching over her over the last few weeks to ensure her safety.\nThe sheriff's office said the bear had \"absolutely no problems getting around.\"\nAuthorities are not sure how the bear lost part of her right leg, which was missing below her knee.\nBear sightings and chases have been a daily ongoing saga as of late as the bruins try to survive a food shortage in the foothills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:47:38.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
