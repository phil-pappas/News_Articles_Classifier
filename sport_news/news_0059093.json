The defending mythical national champion Gaels were taking a break from the out-of-state portion of their schedule to face Shadow Ridge in the first game of Southwest League play. \nTwo years ago in a similar spot, Gorman trailed Legacy in the first half, and won by just 13 points. \nThey wouldn’t struggle tonight, using an interception return for a touchdown by Brendan Radley-Hiles to start the scoring in a 70-7 road victory. \n“You don’t want to get Buster Douglassed,” Gorman coach Kenny Sanchez said, referring to when huge underdog Douglas upset Mike Tyson. \nQuarterback Tate Martell connected with Tyjon Lindsey for a pair of touchdowns, and also scored a rushing touchdown. Dorian Thompson-Robinson had a scoring run of about 70 yards. \nRashad Gage and Jonathan Schumaker each also had touchdowns for Gorman, who improves to 6-0 overall.
