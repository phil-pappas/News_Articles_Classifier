Howard's statistics won't blow you away.\nHe has a modest 13 catches for 183 yards and no touchdowns through five games this season. In his last two games, he's had a combined two catches for eight yards.\nHoward's impact goes far beyond catches and statistics, though.\nIn fact, the non-receiving work has been his best this year for Alabama. It's a big reason he is the second-best tight end in the country, according to Pro Football Focus' grading system . He has a +9.1 run block grade that is exceptional for a tight end that isn't on the field solely to block. Pro Football Focus called him the best \"dual-threat tight end in the nation.\"\n\"He's a great run blocker, one of the two or three best run blockers in college,\" said Matt Miller, the lead NFL Draft writer for Bleacher Report.\nImproving his blocking was a point of emphasis throughout fall camp for Howard, and it was on full display against Georgia. The Alabama junior didn't record a single catch against the Bulldogs in a 38-10 win, but he did a nice job creating holes for Derrick Henry on the line. Alabama needed more of his blocking than receiving, and he got the job done. He could be expected to handle a similar role against Arkansas this week.\n\"We need our tight ends to be able to block,\" said Alabama head coach Nick Saban. \"I think, you know, people say we want to run the ball, we want to run the ball and we want to be a defensive team. Well, that's hard to do when you don't have a tight end that can block effectively. I think O.J. has improved in that area.\"\nDane Brugler, an NFL Draft analyst for CBSSports.com, said Howard isn't an overpowering blocker, but that he's gotten better in some areas. He believes the Alabama tight end has a chance to be a top 50 draft prospect this year.\n\"He has improvements with his footwork as a blocker, with his angles and you can tell he's been working on it,\" Brugler said.\nIn addition to improved blocking, the 6-foot-6, 242-pound tight end is five catches away from surpassing his career record (17) for receptions in a single season. His four-catch, 70-yard performance against Ole Miss is his best receiving game this season, though he also fared well in the passing game against Wisconsin and Middle Tennessee State. Offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin said before the season Howard could receive more targets this year with Amari Cooper now in the NFL .\nMiller thinks Howard needs to show \"more fire in his routes\" and become a crisper route-runner. But he knows that Howard will blow people away at the NFL Draft combine and said he projects as a second or third round pick if he declares at the end of the year. He also has him rated as the second-best tight end in college football.\n\"As someone who played at Alabama, is a good run blocker and a good athlete, that's pretty rare,\" Miller said. \"A lot of times these run blockers are awful receivers. So he has that dual-threat going for him that is pretty hard to find.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/top_ten_list/top-10-college-interior-defenders/", "https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/10/04/pffs-dream-team-best-players-at-every-position/"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:26:58.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
