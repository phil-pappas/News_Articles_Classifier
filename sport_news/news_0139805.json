However, by midmorning, there were no reports of major problems.\nA storm system near the coast this weekend will bring as much as an additional inch of rain to some areas, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe heaviest rain is expected Saturday, although forecasters said it shouldn’t be enough to flood any additional areas.\n“I didn’t want to hear the word rain. But we hope the quantities aren’t going to be great,” said Sel Hemingway, administrator for Georgetown County, where floodwaters from four rivers are converging on the coast.\nAfter the weekend, forecasters predict several more dry days.\nThere is still flooding in South Carolina. All that water from Columbia continues to move toward the sea, although authorities don’t expect the devastating damage that happened when up to 20 inches of rain fell over South Carolina’s capital over two days.\nGov. Nikki Haley continued to urge people in Georgetown County and other coastal areas to be vigilant as flood waters rise. No one has had to be evacuated yet, but the water was isolating some homes, and the governor warned emergency officials could start knocking on doors any time.\nBut the worst may be over even along the coast. The Waccamaw River has crested and the Black River is near crest, Hemingway said Friday afternoon. It will take days or maybe more than a week for the rivers to go below flood stage, but the water should start dropping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:07:52.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
