You practice like that. You prepare like that in the film room, walk-throughs and everything. We go, go, go, go, go, go, go all the time, and the way we communicate up front, going full bore all week and into games, that's only going to help us to be efficient and productive on Sundays.\"\nThe Giants chose to throw the ball down near the goal line late in their 24-10 victory over the Bills and Eli Manning ended up with his first interception of the season. The Giants led by 14 points with 3:51 left and were facing a third-and goal from the Buffalo 8. They could've settled for running the ball, wasting time off the clock and kicking a field goal for a 17-point advantage if unable to get a touchdown.\n\"With over four minutes left in the game, it was a lot of time left in the game,\" McAdoo said. \"And until you start milking the clock in four-minute mode, you want to stay aggressive, keep your foot on the gas, and go for the knockout shot there.\"\nIt's become obvious the Giants acknowledge they are lacking the one ingredient on defense that helps close out games: a pass rush, considering theirs remains under construction.\nSo they're adjusting, attempting to build enough confidence where Manning, Odell Beckham Jr. and Co. can consistently apply the knockout on offense, even when conventional wisdom dictates more conservative play.\n\"The game has probably changed a little bit. You like to put as many big guys on the field as you can at the end of the game and run the ball,\" McAdoo said. \"That's tougher to do now.\"\nSo is the process of trying to become a team that can close out games unconventionally.\nINJURY UPDATE: The Giants declared four players out of the game Sunday night because of injuries: defensive ends Robert Ayers (hamstring) and George Selvie (calf), linebacker Devon Kennard (hamstring) and wide receiver Victor Cruz (calf).\n\"[Kennard] has had a very good start to the season, so obviously we lose his energy, his enthusiasm, his love of the game, his physical play,\" Coughlin said. \"It's unfortunate that he's out this week, but hopefully he'll be back soon.\"\nThe 49ers declared TE Vernon Davis out for Sunday.\nBECKHAM FINED: Odell Beckham Jr. was fined $8,681 for throwing punches and striking Buffalo's Duke Williams in Sunday's win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:19:14.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
