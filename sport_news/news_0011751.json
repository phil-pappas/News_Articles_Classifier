PHOTO BY JONAMAR JACINTO/The Bulletin/ Tweet \nRipon High’s girls golf team is a step closer to capturing its first Valley Foothill League North title under eighth-year coach Eric Dambrosio after beating Escalon 154-160 in the regular-season finale Thursday at Jack Tone Golf Course. \nEscalon’s Madison Kindberg was low medalist Thursday with a 3-over 34. Alex Gonzalez led Ripon with a 36 and was followed by Claire Wever’s 37, Samantha Carl’s 40 and Breeana Huckell’s 41. \nThe Indians are 11-1 in league dual matches and further improved their chances by winning the mid-year tournament. Their only loss was to Bret Harte at Greenhorn Creek, and it came with via tiebreaker on the scorecard. \nThe VFL Championships is next Monday at Micke Grove Golf Links. They were runners-up in each of the last two seasons but were the surprise titlists in the 2013 Sac-Joaquin Section Division V Tournament. \nRipon is in the driver’s seat for one of the three divisional berths. The SJS Division V tourney just so happens to also take place at Micke Grove. \n“Overall I’m very happy with the girls,” Dambrosio said. “We shot 155 the last time we played (at Jack Tone), so we’re getting better and playing consistently. The hard work they’re putting into it is paying off.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:06:38.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
