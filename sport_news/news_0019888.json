Toronto catcher Russell Martin hit Texas batter Shin-Soo Choo with his seemingly simple return throw to the pitcher, which resulted in a go-ahead run for the Rangers after several conferences and an umpire's review. Toronto scored four runs in the bottom of the inning and went on to win 6-3.\nMLB said in a statement Thursday that \"the highly unfortunate reactions of a group of fans at Rogers Centre in Wednesday's game represented a major source of concern.\"\nToronto opens the AL Championship Series at Kansas City on Friday and hosts the Royals for Games 3-5 starting Monday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
