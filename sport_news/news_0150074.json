Gregori teaches the children how to raise livestock, grow vegetables, work as a community - and how to kill. With the birth of a new baby brother weighing on his mind, Alexander begins to question Gregoris overpowering influence on the children and their training to become assassins. Threatened by his increasing unwillingness to fall in line, Gregoris behavior turns erratic and adversarial toward the child he once considered a son. With the two set dangerously at odds and the communes way of life disintegrating, the residents fear a violent resolution is at hand in this Sundance award-winning thriller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T17:28:39.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
