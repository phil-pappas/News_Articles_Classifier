Taylor Sutryk scored twice and Tayah Jackson added a solo goal to help the No. 7 Knights advance to the quarterfinals Friday where they will face the winner of No. 2 Caledonia-Mumford and No. 15 Letchworth. “It was a great win for the girls,” Addison coach Kay Peters said. “I think our fitness helped us. Sometimes you have to wait until the second half to beat somebody.” The wait for the game’s first score was a short one as Jackson scored less than a minute into the second half. “She got loose,” Peters said. Avon, the No. 10 seed, answered midway through the second half when Mackenzie Culhane scored off a penalty kick. Sutryk scored the first of her two goals six minutes later to give Addison a 2-1 lead. Jackson recorded the assist. Sutryk’s next goal came with 11 minutes remaining off a Makenzie Wooldridge assist. “The girls have deceiving speed – they can shift gears at the right moment,” Peters said. “They pushed the ball down and we had a couple of nice give and gos – pass and shoot.” Addison outshot Avon 34-10, but Peters lauded her defense for its strong play. “Kierra DuVall led our defense, which was solid all day,” Peters said. “Avon was physical.” Meg Bulkley had eight saves for Addison, while Amy Fadille stopped 17 shots by the Knights. “They’re keeper was tall and good,” Peters said.
