There is no doubt about it, because you didn't have Warner, Hazlewood and Johnson (in the Bangladesh squad), so there's three players straight away you'd imagine would come back into the reckoning for the first Test,‚Äù Waugh said. \n\"And with different conditions, you're not going to have two spinners at the Gabba in the first Test. There's going to be some guys picked for that tour who are probably going to get shuffled back down the order a little bit, but you can't do anything about it. \n\"At least their names are there, they got picked for an Australian tour, they can take comfort from the fact they're definitely in the reckoning. But the reality is it will be a different 12 for the first Test in Brisbane to what would have been picked in Bangladesh,\" he added.
