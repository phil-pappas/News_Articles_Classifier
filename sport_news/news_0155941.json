The planet Annwn, inhabited by the Garm, is engaged in perpetual warfare among three tribes. One Columba fighter pilot, Khara (St-Pierre), embarks on a quest with an unlikely trio: Kumtak tribal elder Wydd (Henriksen), a sacred dog Gula, and one of the last remaining mystical Druids from a long forgotten time. A Briga soldier, Skellig (Durand), accompanies the small band after forging an uneasy truce with Khara. As they struggle across the land in the search for answers to their existence, they encounter raging storms, fierce giants, and mechanical mayhem. They survive these trials only to meet their most difficult challenge yet, a desperate battle against impossible odds for the truth they seek.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:37:05.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
