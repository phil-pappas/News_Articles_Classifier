Mandatory Credit: Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports\nThe winless Detroit Lions have struggled to find positive takeaways this season, but running back Theo Riddick has been a lone bright spot in an otherwise dull offense.\nRiddick has made the most of the 59 snaps he has received through three games, Kyle Meinke of MLive.com points out. He has accumulated 149 yards from scrimmage, while Ameer Abdullah has produced 154 total yards of offense on 89 snaps and Joique Bell has 63 yards on 61 snaps.\nRiddick is most valuable as a pass-catcher (15 receptions for 144 yards). Wide receiver Calvin Johnson (20) is the only player on the team with more receptions; Lance Dunbar, Dion Lewis and Mark Ingram are the only running backs in the NFL with more receiving yards, according to MLive.com.\nThe Lions are the worst team in the league when it comes to average rushing yards per game ( 45.0 ), and Riddick has done little to rectify that problem. He has taken just one handoff for five yards this season.", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/rushing/sort/rushingYardsPerGame", "http://msn.foxsports.com/", "http://www.mlive.com/lions/index.ssf/2015/10/lost_in_the_offensive_rubble_t.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+detroit-lions+%28Detroit+Lions+-+MLive.com%29"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:15:04.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
