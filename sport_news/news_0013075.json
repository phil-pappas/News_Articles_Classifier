Do the Broncos own the NFL's finest secondary?\nHarris rattles off the reasons Denver deserves strong consideration.\n\"What more do they want to see? We are No. 1 in passing yards, No. 1 in touchdowns allowed. They should get rid of all the names. The names shouldn't even matter now,\" Harris said Monday. \"It should be about how we are playing.\"\nFor the past two seasons, the Seattle Seahawks set the standard. The Legion of Boom shoved Seattle to its first Super Bowl crown and came within a Russell Wilson interception of back-to-back titles. The unit deserves respect. But are they still the best?\nWATCH: Denver Broncos Week 6 report by Troy E. Renck\nFive victories remain a small sample size, but no secondary boasts the Broncos' diary of destruction. The group — safeties T.J. Ward and Darian Stewart, corners Harris and Aqib Talib and reserves David Bruton and Bradley Roby — have made seven interceptions, seven tackles for losses and five forced fumbles.\nThe numbers portray a dangerous mix of speed, aggression and confidence.\n\"They are a group of ballhawks. All of them make plays and have their own little swag,\" said veteran defensive lineman Antonio Smith.\nAdvertisement \"They are by far the most animated group on the team.\"\nHarris brings consistency. He hasn't yielded a touchdown pass since Nov. 24, 2013, a streak spanning 28 games. Talib, who is nursing a sprained right ankle, provides energy. He features long arms, sticky fingers and a return man's moves in the open field. Ward drops the hammer, capable of lighting up a receiver or pulling down a quarterback on a perfectly timed blitz. Stewart provides a calm mind and previously missing muscle. He seeks contact in the open field.\nThe popular narrative last season revolved around whether the Broncos were tough enough after the Seahawks demolished them in the Super Bowl. The question produces crickets now, a new identity forged through a relentless pass rush and a battery of big tackles by the secondary.\nWATCH: Should Peyton Manning be replaced by Brock Osweiler as Denver's starter?\n\"It really started with DStew, adding him to the puzzle and seeing the physical mentality that he's bringing out there on the field,\" Harris said. \"If somebody is breaking through the hole, he's smacking them. Or T.J. is smacking them. We have been in games where (opponents' receivers) are like, 'I am down. I am down.' They are screaming it because they know that they are about to get hit.\"\nBroncos cornerback Chris Harris knocks the ball away from Oakland Raiders receiver Michael Crabtree on Sunday at O.co Coliseum. Harris later made a bigger play than that by returning an interception 74 yards for a touchdown. ( Joe Amon, The Denver Post ) Two things changed since last season: the free-agent signing of Stewart and the installation of the 3-4 set by defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. The scheme fits the secondary's athleticism and attitude, turning an acoustic vibe electric.\n\"I played with DBs in college who all made the NFL,\" Ward said. \"But I have never been on a secondary like this or on a defense like this. We go into the game believing the other team won't score.\"\nWhat separates this secondary is that, well, nothing separates them. They have become close, hanging out off the field, creating a bond that allows them to turn midweek practice film sessions into Sunday highlight reels. Harris, Talib, Ward, Stewart, Roby and Bruton all own plays that changed games or clinched victories.\nHow dominant has the group been? Minnesota's Mike Wallace is the only wide receiver to catch a touchdown pass against the Broncos.\n\"When we are in the meeting room, it' s not just the coaches talking and us listening,\" Bruton said. \"We are interacting, (Talib) is pointing out something to me or I will point out something to T.J. or Chris will point something out to Stew or Chris will say something to Roby. We police ourself, and that's been great. There's definitely a high level of accountability. The only thing missing is a Super Bowl ring. As long as we have the hunger, there's no limit to what we can do.\"\nTroy E.
