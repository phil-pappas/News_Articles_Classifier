The accused — Ramesh, Rajbir and Rajkumar —were booked for abetment of suicides. A special investigation team (SIT), headed by DSP Jaipal Singh, was constituted to probe the “suicides” of Badan Singh and his nephew Gurbachan Singh. Badan Singh allegedly committed suicide yesterday. His nephew Gurbachan was found hanging from a tree at Chainat village on October 8. Sources said Badan, the prime witness in Gurbachan’s death, committed suicide as he was allegedly being pressured by the accused. Badan left a suicide note stating he was being threatened by some persons for giving statements in Gurbachan’s death, they said. DC Chander Shekhar Khare said disciplinary action had been initiated against SHO Jagbir Singh and investigating officer Rajbir Singh for lapses in the investigation of Gurbachan’s death. Rajat Kalsan, a Dalit activist, said Fatehabad SP Kalia had assured them that she would also investigate the role of Hansi ASP Jashandeep Singh Randhawa in the case. Randhawa, the in charge of the Hansi police, has claimed the police did not take any action as forensic examinations and a post-mortem report confirmed that Gurbachan “committed suicide”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:06:49.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
