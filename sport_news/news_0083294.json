That position is currently held by Hayatou, president of Africa’s football confederation (CAF). \nSpanish Football Federation president Villar is positioned to take over from Platini as he is the European governing body’s highest-ranking vice-president. \nVillar has been widely reported to be facing a Fifa ethics investigation himself related to Spain’s joint bid with Portugal for the 2018 World Cup. Fifa’s ethics committee is not allowed to confirm or deny the existence of any investigations. \nIn 2011, Hayatou was reprimanded by the International Olympics Committee’s ethics commission after he confirmed to them that he was paid by Fifa’s former marketing agency International Sport and Leisure in 1995. \nThe IOC said such an action constituted a conflict of interest. Hayatou denied any personal gain or wrongdoing. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
