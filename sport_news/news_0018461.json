Michael P. Murphy, USN.\nMurphy, born in Smithtown and raised in Patchogue, died at age 29 in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005. The Navy SEAL team leader posthumously received the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions that helped lead to the rescue of fellow SEAL Marcus Luttrell. The incident was the subject of the 2013 film “Lone Survivor.”\nAdmission to the 5 p.m. game is free, with a $5 donation to the Lt. Michael P. Murphy Memorial Scholarship Fund suggested. The Long Island Gulls youth hockey team is a co-sponsor of the day-long program, which includes pregame addresses by Murphy’s parents and former Islander and Ranger Pat LaFontaine, and a “Murph” fitness challenge.\nMore information is available at the NY Bobcats/LI Gulls Military Appreciation Day page on Facebook.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under Hockey ,  lone survivor ,  navy seals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:13:17.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
