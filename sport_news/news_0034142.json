Dickey said. “Nineteen years of playing.” Here’s a look at five key moments from the Jays’ series-clinching victory:\nGoins’ run-saving snag\nThe homers will get the glory, but the Jays also won with their defence Wednesday. Russell Martin, who led all American League catchers by throwing out more than 44 per cent of baserunners this season, gunned down Elvis Andrus trying to steal third to end the second inning; Kevin Pillar stole a bloop hit from Josh Hamilton in the fourth, running forever and diving headlong to make the catch, leaving a literal skid mark in shallow left-centre; Josh Donaldson barehanded a Delino DeShields’ chopper in the seventh to keep the speedy Ranger off the bases. Perhaps most important of all was Ryan Goins, who helped Marcus Stroman get out of the sixth inning with a slick, sliding snag on Andrus’ would-be RBI grounder up the middle. That kept the Jays within one.\nEncarnacion’s parrot trot\nWith the Jays back in the dugout after Goins’ run-saving play, Edwin Encarnacion stepped to the plate with one out in the sixth and crushed Cole Hamels’ first pitch of the at-bat off the facing of the upper-deck to tie the game at two. The Rangers had tried to stay away from Encarnacion all series, intentionally walking him a Jays franchise-record three times over the last five games. When they pitched to him, he made them pay. The solo shot was tracked off the bat at 110 mph and travelled an estimated 436 feet — the fifth-longest homer in the post-season thus far. “I kind of had the feeling Eddie was about to erupt, too,” Gibbons said.\nControversial play\nWith the game tied at two and the Rangers’ Rougned Odor at third base, Jays’ catcher Russell Martin’s routine throw back to pitcher Aaron Sanchez ricocheted off of Shin-Soo Choo’s outstretched hand as he stood in the batter’s box. Odor ran home on the play, but as he did, home-plate umpire Dale Scott called time. Rangers’ manager Jeff Banister asked Scott to confer with the rest of the umpiring crew, after which time they decided to count the run. Frustrated fans started raining beer cans and other debris onto the field. MLB rules state that if a batter is hit by a throw back to the pitcher while standing in the batter’s box, and in the umpire’s judgment he did not intend to interfere, the ball is live. The Jays played the game under protest from that point. Scott admitted after the game he made a mistake by calling time.\nRangers fall apart\nFollowing the chaos and confusion of the top of the seventh inning, the Rangers returned to the field twitchy and tense. They made three straight errors to start the bottom of the seventh inning as the Jays loaded the bases against Hamels with none out. “They kicked the ball around and we took advantage of it,” Pillar said. Banister said his players were unable to “slow the heart rate down and make a baseball play.” Veteran shortstop Elvis Andrus was charged with two of the misplays. “The human part of me feels badly for Elvis,” Dickey said after the game. “It’s hard. But we’ll take it any way we can get it.”\nBautista’s blast\nPillar said it was the biggest home run hit in Toronto since Joe Carter’s World Series walk-off in 1993, and he’s right. Bautista’s game-winning, three-run bomb in the seventh inning — after everything that had happened leading up to it — was among the biggest hits in Blue Jays’ history. The brazen slugger’s subsequent bat flip was just as epic. The roiling tension that had built up in that riotous seventh inning combusted as the ball jumped off Bautista’s bat. It felt as if the roof would pop off the Rogers Centre. “That’s what big-time players do,” Pillar said. “This guy’s been part of this franchise for a long time. First post-season. For him to do that, under the circumstances, to put us up by three runs? That’s a home run we’ll be talking about for a long time.”\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays epic seventh inning: a batter-by-batter breakdown\nFans and Toronto Police celebrating the Blue Jays’ victory", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:57:29.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
