But who could have possibly predicted 41-year-old Ichiro Suzuki taking the mound for the Miami Marlins and blessing us with his never-before-seen pitching talents?\nAdChoices Well that’s exactly what happened on Sunday in the Marlins regular season finale against the Philadelphia Phillies. With both teams long eliminated from the postseason and nothing left to play for, Miami manager Dan Jennings decided to have some fun and hand the ball to his Japanese right fielder in the eighth inning.\nIt was the first time that the veteran had taken the mound in his 15-year MLB career, and he didn’t disappoint.\nICHRIO IS OUT THERE THROWING SLIDERS pic.twitter.com/CpZ0qO1Oiv\n— Joon Lee (@iamjoonlee) October 4, 2015\nHeck, he even flashed a filthy sweeping slider.\nIchiro will the nasty slider. #Marlins https://t.co/OdBcE0WUfV\n— Max Wildstein (@MaxWildstein) October 4, 2015\nThough Ichiro allowed two hits, including an RBI double, he retired three batters to work his way out of the eighth and even topped out at 87 mph.\nIchiro Suzuki's fastball peaked at 87 MPH Appears he threw a changeup & slider too. Career ERA: 9.00\n— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 4, 2015\nIchiro, who has expressed his interest in cameo pitching at the major league level before , finally got to see his MLB mound dreams come to fruition in Sunday’s finale. And not a bad effort at all, I must say.\nAnd hey, it looks like he’s already a better pitcher than Cam Bedrosian!\nH/T SB Nation\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/MaxWildstein/status/650801598063624193", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ichiro&#39;s", "https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/650785726968274944", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf77mr.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "https://t.co/OdBcE0WUfV", "http://larrybrownsports.com/baseball/ichiro-pitch-yankees-joe-girardi/230369", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/iamjoonlee/status/650784783543443457", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Marlins?src=hash", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jimmy", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf7ckJ.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf6zlF.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA2e9Q&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Miami", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://t.co/CpZ0qO1Oiv", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Highlights:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf7Y8y.img&quot;}}", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2015/10/4/9451107/ichiro-suzuki-marlins-pitching-im-crying"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:13:21.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
