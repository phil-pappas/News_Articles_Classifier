although the third-placed team with the best record will automatically qualify, the result of which will be known on Tuesday following the final fixtures. \nKostas Mitroglou and Panagiotis Kone struck in the last 11 minutes as the 2004 champions came from behind to win for the first time in their Group F qualifying campaign. \nPortugal concluded their qualifying campaign with a 2-1 win in Serbia, who finished the game with nine men as Aleksandar Kolarov and Nemanja Matic were shown red. \nWith their place in next summer's finals already assured, Portugal coach Fernando Santos allowed talisman Cristiano Ronaldo extra time off before returning to club side Real Madrid. \nRonaldo's former Manchester United team-mate Nani tapped in the rebound from a saved Danny shot to give the Group I winners a fifth-minute lead. \nZoran Tosic equalised an hour later but Serbia were not level for long as Joao Moutinho's delightful curling shot after 78 minutes restored Portugal's lead. \nSteven Fletcher scored his second Group D hat-trick against Gibraltar as Scotland concluded their failed campaign with an easy 6-0 win over the section minnows at the Estadio Algarve in Faro. \nGordon Strachan's makeshift side - seven changes from the one that started in the 2-2 draw against Poland on Thursday night which ended their hopes of reaching France next summer - took a two-goal lead into the interval after Chris Martin's first international goal was followed by a wonderful Shaun Maloney strike. \nFletcher, who scored three in the 6-1 win over Gibraltar at Hampden in March, scored twice in four minutes after the break and then grabbed another with a fine 85th-minute finish before Steven Naismith, on for Martin, made it 6-0 in added time.
