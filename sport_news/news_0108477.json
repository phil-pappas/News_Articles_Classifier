The board is set to approve five requests asking state agencies to adjust funding formulas based on attendance after the fire forced evacuations from campuses beginning Sept. 10. The 70,868-acre blaze ultimately closed schools in the district between six and eight days, depending on their proximity to the fire. The district receives money annually from the state based on the average daily attendance of students, or ADA. The missed days would result in a loss of money when the state calculates the figure at the end of the school year, said Superintendent Mark Campbell. “Our main issue is making sure we don’t lose money,” he said. The loss could be about $960,000, according to what Campbell estimates the district receives from the state — $40 per student per day for the roughly 3,000 students. The adjustment will “essentially take those days out of the equation,” said Campbell. In addition, the board will request separate adjustments be made for the after-school programs at Rail Road Flat, West Point, and Jenny Lind elementary schools. Program funds are also based on ADA numbers and come from state grant money administered through the Stanislaus County Office of Education. Preschool programs at San Andreas, Valley Springs, West Point and Jenny Lind, too, require requests from the district to adjust ADA levels and secure adequate funding from the California Department of Education’s Early Support Division. All of the money will come in at the start of the 2016-17 school year. The district has already asked the state for $30,954.35 that could have come from regular reimbursements for school lunches served during the closure. The state will reimburse schools for the number of hot lunches and breakfasts purchased or received through the free and reduced-cost lunch program. Should a school be rendered non-operational due to a natural disaster, the district can apply to get money for the lunches it would have provided with the Child Nutritional Fiscal Services Department of the California Department of Education. But the “disaster relief payments” are contingent on available funding in the State’s Reserve for Economic Uncertainties. When and if the district will receive the money is unknown, said Melanie Hernandez, office assistant for the district’s Food Services Department. Each request entails documentation to prove the cause of the closures. “Our technology and business departments had to come up with quite a bit of paper to engage in this process,” Campbell said. In the case of meal reimbursements, the district submitted calculations of meals expected to be served, record of Gov. Jerry Brown’s declaration of a State of Emergency in Calaveras and Amador counties, Cal Fire news releases about evacuations and road closures, and district communications about the disaster. Campbell takes the mound of paperwork in stride. “It adds an impact,” he said, and added “it’s another unintended consequence of the natural disaster.” Campbell said the district must go through the same process for snow days and power outages. The district should know in a month if the state accepts the requests, Campbell said. The board Tuesday must also approve the rescheduling of a Science Camp originally slated during the fire. Other business at the meeting will include information about the district’s recent grant application for $150,000 to replace school buses, part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Clean Diesel Rebate Program.
