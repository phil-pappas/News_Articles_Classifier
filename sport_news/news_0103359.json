USA Today Sports 3 hrs ago Cam Smith\nJavaris Steward is a 4* LB from Pomona HS, CA. He becomes #USC 4th commitment in the 2017 Class! @javaris_success pic.twitter.com/8zldBHiKhs\n— USC Trojans (@USCTrojansFO) October 20, 2015\nThe way we’re going, perhaps it should be no surprise that college football pledges are increasingly being measured by days, not months. Now one junior star is taking those matters even further, measuring his commitment in the hours of a single day … and not that many at that.\nAdChoices On Monday morning, junior linebacker Javaris Steward , who stars at Pomona Senior high, announced that he was committing to USC. The decision came just days after Steward took in USC’s loss to Notre Dame, so it made chronological sense. Of course, chronological sense doesn’t necessarily justify a four-year commitment, and Steward apparently had second thoughts when he took in the full circumstances surrounding USC right now. Like, say, how the Trojans are playing without a permanent head coach and a coaching staff in flux.\nWith those potential future changes in mind, Steward announced that he was no longer pledged to USC, meaning his commitment to the Trojans lasted fewer than 18 hours . Not 18 days, 18 hours.\nThe entire situation seems ripped from a headline in The Onion, except it’s true. Of course, as a member of the Class of 2017, Steward still has plenty of time to make a college decision and head to the school of his choice, even if that so happens to be USC. And it very well might. We just won’t know yet, even though it briefly looked like we would.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://247sports.com/Player/Javaris-Steward-77859", "https://twitter.com/javaris_success", "http://www.scout.com/college/football/recruiting/story/1601288-trojans-get-2017-linebacker", "https://t.co/8zldBHiKhs", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/USC?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/USCTrojansFO/status/656349671791554560", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:38:24.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
