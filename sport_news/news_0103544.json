They want to be the first squad in Region 8- to stop the Red Elephants’ spread attack and quarterback Messiah Dorsey. \nWatching the two region rivals arrive at those answers could prove thrilling indeed, as Gainesville plays host to Lanier at City Park in a match-up of the only two teams still undefeated in 8- play. ( NOTE : For a look at all area contests scheduled for Week 7, click here .) \n“It’s a playoff atmosphere, and it’s really a playoff game when you look at it. It’s supposed to be a great crowd, great weather. Hopefully we’ll do well and, hopefully things will be OK,” Red Elephants coach Bruce Miller said. \n“You talk about a Friday night at atmosphere at the type of place and the type of game you want to be in, that’s City Park, and we’re just lucky to be there,” Longhorns coach Korey Mobbs added. \nThere has been very little luck involved in how these two teams have reached this contest -- each dominating in different manners. Lanier has shut down every foe played this season, allowing just 6.6 points per game behind a defense that features Brown, who is ranked by a number of recruiting services as the top-rated player in the state. The senior rotates along every position of the defensive front and is disruptive at all of them, leading the team in tackles for loss (20), sacks (5), and quarterback hurries (14). He is also tied for third on the team with 43 tackles and has one interception and one fumble recovery to his name. \n“Derrick Brown is a very imposing figure to watch and tell your right tackle, who’s 6-2, 195 that he’s going to have to block Derrick Brown, whose 6-3 280,” Miller said. “But we’ll rise to the challenge.” \nThe Red Elephants also know they’ll have to be wary of more than just Brown, as Lanier defensive end Michael Allen also has 4 sacks, 7 QB hurries, 1 interception and 1 fumble recovery. Linebackers Tyler Taylor (team-high 55 tackles) and Juwuan James (51 tackles) are also active and have played key roles for a defense that has forced 13 turnovers, 9 interceptions. \nYet Gainesville’s defense hasn’t been too shabby either, allowing just 13.2 points per game -- 8 through four region wins -- while forcing 17 turnovers of their own, including 11 interceptions. \n“We’re playing great. We’re playing lights out each week; we’re getting better and better each week and progressing,” said defensive back Chris Lyles, who has five interceptions to his name. “Our defensive coordinator (Mike Newton) is coming up with great plays for us in the secondary to come at the offense and blitz more, so it’s helping a lot.” \nGainesville has shut out two of its last three opponents, allowing just six points over that span, while also forcing 10 turnovers. \nThe Red Elephants do face a key question, however, as starting defensive lineman Cole Handte -- who averages a team-high 7.3 tackles per game and, at 6-foot-3, 270 pounds, is the largest player at the point of attack for Gainesville -- will miss the contest through injury. A number of players will rotate in looking to fill the position for Gainesville. \nMobbs says he expects a battle, no matter who plays for the Red Elephants. \n“They’re still extremely talented at linebacker. Up front they’ve played really well. They’ve got some big guys, and I think their secondary is the best we’ve faced,” Mobbs said. “They’re opportunistic -- when the ball’s in the air they go get it, so it’s going to be a great challenge.” \nThe Longhorns also expect a challenge in slowing Gainesville’s spread attack and -- most pointedly -- dual-threat quarterback Messiah Dorsey, who is completing 64 percent of his passes for 155 yards per game (9 passing TDs, 3 interceptions) while also rushing for 60 yards per game (second on team). His 5 rushing scores also leads the team. \n“The first thing you notice when you flip on the film is the fact that they can go 80 or 90 in a heartbeat with many different guys. I think their quarterback brings a different element than what they had last year,” Mobbs said. “The Gonzalez kid was a really good quarterback for them, but when you look at Dorsey, he brings the run-pass option, so you have to account for him on every play.” \nGainesville’s defense, meanwhile, will look to account for the Longhorns’ rushing duo of Marcella and Marcko Baity. Marcella Baity leads Lanier with 382 yards rushing (4.72 yards per carry) and has 3 TDs, while Marcko Baity is just behind at 318 yards (5.3 per carry) and 5 TDs. The duo have helped Lanier overcome the loss of senior standout Ashton Barnes, out for the season with a knee injury. \n“On offense, there’s no mistake about it. We’re going to run the football and then take our chances in the passing game when we can, so you gotta set the tone on the offensive line, so I think that’ll be a key match-up,” Mobbs said. \nAnd while the Red Elephants may not have as many chances to add to their interception totals this weekend, Lyles feels he and his teammates will be ready -- especially after dropping a 26-23 nip-and-tuck battle to the Longhorns last season in a game that essentially decided the Region 8- crown. \n“We’ve been waiting for this game all year since last year, because it’s been on our shoulders, been on our chests,” Lyles said. “We went down with a field goal last season so this game means a lot.” \nIt’s a statement that could go for both squads, and with what’s on the line perhaps that’s even understating it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:04:40.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
