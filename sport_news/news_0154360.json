Real Salt Lake (11-13-8) is tied for eighth, six points back of the Timbers.\nJamison Olave was given a straight red card in the 52nd minute for taking down Lucas Melano in a goal-scoring position. Nick Rimando picked the wrong direction on Adi's penalty kick.\nAdi had a close-range shot saved in the 21st, and Rimando came out of his box to block Adi's fast-break attempt in the 44th.\nAdam Kwarasey preserved his MLS-leading 13th shutout with a reaction save of Javier Morales deflected shot in the 91st.\nPortland Timbers' Diego Valeri (8) takes a shot as Real Salt Lake's Aaron Maund (21) defends in the first half during an MLS soccer game Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2015, in Sandy, Utah.
