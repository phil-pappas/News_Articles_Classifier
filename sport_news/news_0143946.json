Perhaps not as many as most teams, but questions nonetheless. Who would replace starting cornerbacks Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner? Who would offset the departures of running backs Shane Vereen and Stevan Ridley? Would rookie long snapper Joe Cardona be able to make the transition from Navy to New England? As for the offensive line, with four returning starters the only uncertainty seemed to be who would take over at left guard for the retired Dan Connolly. Then center Bryan Stork was sidelined by injuries and right guard Ryan Wendell was grounded by illness. Three games into the season, the two have yet to play, leaving towering twin tackles Nate Solder and Sebastian Vollmer as the only familiar faces protecting Tom Brady. For No. 12, it was no problem. “You know, truthfully, I never worry about the offensive line much,” Brady said Wednesday. “We’ve just been so well-coached over the years.” And, indeed, the offense, which struggled mightily in the first month last season due to continuity, chemistry and communication concerns across the line, was practically unstoppable in September. The Patriots went undefeated and scored more points (119) in their first three games than any team in franchise history. That outsized productivity came with three rookie linemen playing significant roles on the interior. Center David Andrews, who went undrafted in May, is the only Patriot to play every snap this season while fourth-round draft choices Tre’ Jackson and Shaq Mason have combined for three starts while sharing time at the two guard spots with unheralded Josh Kline, who went undrafted in 2013. “I think those guys have done such a great job,” Brady said. “I don’t think I’ve ever put a lot of concern into whether those guys were capable of doing what they’re asked to do, and I think we’ve had a lot of confidence in the guys who have been in there this year.” Kline figured to make a strong bid for Connolly’s spot after appearing in 14 games last season, including starting in the AFC championship. He’s made three starts and played 84.8 percent of the offensive snaps, which is more than triple his workload from last season. Andrews has been the biggest, and most valuable, surprise. A three-year starter for SEC powerhouse Georgia, he stepped in at center for Stork and, after overcoming some early snapping issues in training camp, rather quickly developed a bond with Brady when it comes to such things as identifying the defense and picking up the snap count. Credit there goes to both parties. “I mean [David] and Tom, it’s like they’ve been together a long time,” offensive line coach Dave DeGuglielmo said. “They have an understanding of one another, they work well, and it’s a credit to David being very intelligent and Tom also understanding, ‘Hey, I’m bringing this guy along until we get back some of these other guys.’” Jackson, a unanimous All-America selection as a senior at Florida State, has started two games at right guard and played 48.4 percent of the snaps. Mason, who was drafted 10 picks after Jackson, has made one start at left guard and played 66.8 percent of the snaps, a total bolstered by his duties as a blocking fullback in short-yardage situations. Mason was a three-year starter at Georgia Tech, which employs a ground-based offense. That’s given him an edge over his fellow rookies when it comes to blocking for running backs Dion Lewis and LeGarrette Blount, who have combined to rush for five touchdowns. “I don’t think anybody is further ahead than Shaq is in the running game,” Belichick said. As for pass protection, that understandably remains a work in progress for a player who comes from a program that ran the ball 80 percent of the time last season. By contrast, the Patriots have passed about 65 percent of the time in their first three games. “He’s worked very hard on the techniques and he has a long way to go to get to the level we’re looking for, but it’s been an interesting transition,” DeGuglielmo said of Mason, who seems to have the most upside among the three rookie blockers. “He’s been frustrated at times, but I think he’s beginning to feel a little more comfortable in pass setting and working games and twists and understanding pressures.” The three rookies have been more sufficient than efficient thus far, which DeGuglielmo didn’t hesitate to point out. “There’s getting the job done and then there’s making it look pretty,” he said. “I think we’re more interested in getting the job done at this point. We’re going to work towards making it look right and everything being right.” As for the tackles, the Patriots have continued with a rotation that started last year with Marcus Cannon subbing in on the left side for Solder and on the right side for Vollmer. Solder has played 89.7 percent of the snaps, Vollmer 72.6 percent and Cannon 44.4 percent, as he’s also seen time at guard. Although it’s early in the season and the need to manage players for health reasons is minimal, that was a factor in the Patriots’ approach to enter Cannon into the equation last year. Then there’s the fact that the team believes the fifth-year pro deserves to play. “I think when you look at last year we were able to get a near-complete season out of Sebastian because we had three tackles rotating for quite a bit of the year,” DeGuglielmo said of the 31-year-old Vollmer, who missed 19 games from 2011 to ’13 due to injuries. “Marcus is a capable lineman and he needs an opportunity to go in there and work on his techniques against a live defense, not a show team. If you have three tackles, you play three tackles. If you have three guards, you play three guards. … That’s just part of, since I’ve been here, how it’s been done, so I don’t know any different.” By Rich Garven", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:49:51.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
