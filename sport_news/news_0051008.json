I feel like 27 points is maybe too much.\"\nAuburn (4-2, 1-2 SEC) ranks last in the SEC in total defense and is near the bottom in several other categories as it prepares to travel to Arkansas this week.\nThough Auburn never trailed Kentucky, the Wildcats were outgaining the Tigers most of Thursday night's game and finished with a 497-407 edge in total yards with 359 coming in the air.\n\"We didn't play too well the first three quarters,\" Garrett said. \"We just pretty much knew we had to seal the game and forget about what happened the first three quarters and just win the game. That's all that matters, winning on the road in the SEC game.\"\nAuburn had the game's lone takeaway, an interception in the end zone by Davis to preserve a 14-7 Tigers lead with 13:56 to go before halftime.\nAuburn CB Carlton Davis Auburn cornerback Carlton Davis discusses Thursday's 30-27 win at Kentucky. (James Crepea/jcrepea@al.com)\n\"I knew we needed a turnover,\" said Davis, who had his second interception in as many games. \"I didn't want them to tie the game up.\"\nKentucky converted 5 of 13 third downs, including 3 of 6 in the first half on passes on 20, 39 and 36 yards.\nLinebacker Tre' Williams said the big gains on third down were a source of frustration.\n\"They're trying to run the ball and you get big stops and then they end up getting that third down conversion, you're kind of like, 'Ah, again?' You have to play another three downs,\" Williams said. \"But it's still the game of football. They got recruited like we got recruited. They're still pretty good athletes but then again you have to execute better.\"\nAfter the latter two conversions, Auburn held Kentucky to a field goal thanks to a Rudy Ford sack on third-and-goal from the four-yard line.\n\"Very inconsistent,\" linebacker Cassanova McKinzy said. \"Very inconsistent but very tough and we're going to get better.\"\nThe inconsistency was why Auburn coach Gus Malzahn's decision to punt on fourth-and-one from the Auburn 47-yard line with 2:19 to go was such a confidence boost for a defense that had allowed 458 yards to that point.\n\"I want to get back on the field and try to redeem myself because we didn't play too good,\" Garrett said. \"I'm hoping the game can end in the defense hand and try to redeem (ourselves) and show why we came to Auburn to play football.\"\n Auburn LB Justin Garrett Justin Garrett discusses his sack that sealed Auburn's 30-/7 win at Kentucky.
