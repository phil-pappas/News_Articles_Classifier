In his first action since Week 2, Rapoza wanted to make a statement Friday night against Barnstable and so did the rest of his team with history on the line. As the first varsity football game played at Andrea McCoy field, the Whalers played with a purpose and it showed in their 41-20 victory over the visiting Red Raiders. “It was exciting for them,” said New Bedford head coach Mark DeBrito of the program’s first home game on turf. “I told them this is going in the record books and the way to go in the books is to do it with a ‘W.’ You don’t want to be the first team to play on the turf and lose. For them, they took it kind of personal.” Ryan Dauphnais ran for 191 yards and two touchdowns for Barnstable, but the Red Raiders dropped their fourth straight game. Before coming out for the pregame warmups, the Whalers (2-2) huddled on the north end zone, chanting “History! History! History!” “Coach said let’s make some history today and the whole time we were playing, that was in the back of our minds,” said Rapoza, who missed the last game after suffering a concussion early against Everett two weeks ago. “It felt amazing. Those two weeks, I was losing myself. I didn’t know what I was doing.” It didn’t take long for Rapoza to find himself again on the football field. On New Bedford’s first offensive play, he connected over the middle with Manny Onuoha Jr. on a 42-yard strike. Two plays later, senior Jordan Ross was celebrating his first touchdown of the season on an eight-yard run. Rapoza’s two-point conversion run put the Whalers on top 8-6 with 5:21 left in the first quarter. The Red Raiders answered with a punishing 12-play, 80-yard drive that ate nearly nine minutes off the clock and capped it off with Dauphnais’s five-yard touchdown run, the first of two scores by the senior running back. His game-high 191 yards came on 19 carries, but most came in the first half. “We knew he was going to be tough,” DeBrito said. “He did a good job with his reads and he had a burst. In the second half, we made some adjustments and went more man (coverage).” Dauphnais couldn’t be caught on Barnstable’s opening drive of the third quarter when he carried the ball three times for 58 yards, including a 37-yard touchdown scamper to put the Red Raiders ahead 20-14. But he was quiet the rest of the game as New Bedford’s defense focused on stopping him. “He’s been great for us all year, but teams eventually key on him and try to take him away,” said Barnstable head coach Chris Whidden. “We talk run game, run game, run game, but we’ve got to get better in the pass game.” Starting quarterback Keaton Bergal completed just two passes for negative 11 yards. Bergal did carry the ball 16 times for 69 yards and scored Barnstable’s first touchdown. “We’ve just got to become more multi-dimensional on offense,” Whidden said. “We’re too predictable. We can only do a couple of things well and once teams figure that out, we’re in trouble.” New Bedford kept Barnstable off the scoreboard for the final 20 minutes of the game and the offense picked apart the Red Raiders’ defense with Rapoza scoring back-to-back touchdowns, Jonathan Moraes finding the end zone and Ross getting another TD to cap the scoring. All six of New Bedford’s touchdowns came on the ground. “Those guys can do some pretty good things when they touch the ball,” DeBrito said. “Those guys running really broke the game open.” Moraes rushed for 170 yards on 11 carries while Rapoza carried the ball nine times for 70 yards and completed two-of-five passes for 47 yards. Whidden said the Red Raiders had a tough time against Rapoza in the option. “When he gets to the edge, he’s good with the football in his hands and he’s a dual threat,” he said. “Every team we play has great athletes carrying the football and New Bedford was no exception.” By Laurie Los", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:34:06.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
