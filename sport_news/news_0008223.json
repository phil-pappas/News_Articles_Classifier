Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth, United States.\nInternational captain Nick Price figured the Americans were \"going for the kill\" by sending out this tandem. The South Africans were up to the task. They traded birdies early, and Johnson gave the Americans their only lead with an 18-foot birdie putt on No. 7. The turning point was a 70-foot birdie putt by Oosthuizen across the green at No. 8. Grace followed with a 15-foot birdie on the ninth and a 20-foot birdie on the 10th for a 2-up lead. Oosthuizen's birdie on the 14th made it 3 up, and Grace hit a wedge out of the rough that rolled up to inches of the cup for a conceded birdie on the 15th.\nSang-moon Bae and Danny Lee, International, def. Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker, United States, 1 up.\nThe International team never led until the final hole, when Bae delivered what International captain Nick Price described as the \"highlight of the last two days for us.\" The Americans jumped out to a 2-up lead through three holes behind Fowler's 8-foot birdie and the International team unable to birdie the par-3 fifth. The Americans lost two holes around the turn and it was all square the rest of the way. Neither team could make a putt, and the Americans didn't make a birdie over the last 11 holes. On the 18th, Bae missed the green and chipped to 12 feet, and he poured in the birdie putt for the win.\nZach Johnson and Phil Mickelson, United States, halved with Adam Scott and Jason Day, International.\nThe scorecard shows a U.S. victory. Mickelson not knowing the rules led to a halve. The match was square through six holes when Mickelson decided to put a different golf ball in play to reach the green on the par-5 seventh. But there is a one-ball rule, and the penalty is a one-hole adjustment for the violation. The rules committee made a mistake by telling Mickelson he couldn't finish the hole, and Day won it with a birdie. The International side won the hole and received a one-hole adjustment, going from all square to 2 up. Mickelson battled back by making birdie on the 11th and holing a 142-yard bunker shot on No. 12. Day squared it with a birdie on the 15th. With Johnson in tight for a certain birdie on the 18th, Day made an 8-foot birdie putt for a half-point.\nJ.B. Holmes and Bubba Watson, United States, def. Marc Leishman and Steven Bowditch, International, 2 up.\nHolmes and Watson have yet to trail this week, although this match was a tight one. Two quick birdies gave them a 2-up lead through three holes, and Leishman and Bowditch answered with birdies to tie it. Holmes made a birdie on No. 12 for a lead the Americans never relinquished, but it still came down to the 18th and a chance for the International team to earn a half and made the overall score 5-all through two sessions. Bowditch drove into the water and Leishman found the rough and couldn't get home in two on the par 5. Holmes hit a sensational fairway bunker shot to 30 feet, and the Americans were conceded the eagle when Leishman had to settle for par.\nThongchai Jaidee and Charl Schwartzel, International, def. Bill Haas and Chris Kirk, United States, 2 and 1.\nThe International team didn't have to do much to take control as the Americans made nothing better than par for the opening 13 holes. By then, Schwartzel and Jaidee were 3 up and headed for another blue point on the board. Haas rolled in a birdie putt on the 16th hole to cut the deficit to 1 down with two holes remaining, but Schwartzel won the match with a birdie on the 17th. It was the first match for Schwartzel, who spent the early part of the week recovering from a virus.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
