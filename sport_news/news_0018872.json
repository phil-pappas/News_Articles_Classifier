The move, first reported by The New York Times , sparked a national backlash, of which Sanders was among the most vocal.\nSanders, who has campaigned on lowering prescription drug prices , and Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings sent a letter to Shkreli to investigate Turing and the price increase of Daraprim—to which Shkreli never responded, upsetting Sanders.\n“Mr. Shkreli is holding hostage the patients who rely on this lifesaving medication, as well as the hospitals that administer it, by charging unconscionable prices for a drug on which he has a monopoly — just because he can,” said Sanders and Cummings in a news release Oct. 12, via Business Insider .\nFor his part, Shkreli said he genuinely supports many of Sanders’ policies, but he said he wants to talk about the costs of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry Sanders often rails against .\n@SenSanders It's amazing to me that you, desiring to be the leader of our country, are so misinformed. Let's have a public debate on this.\n— Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) October 9, 2015 Shkreli has said he will lower the price of Daraprim, but has yet to do so and told Business Insider it won’t be anywhere near the “critical drug’s” original price.\nRead Stat’s full report here .", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34331761", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html?ref=topics", "http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/10/15/bernie-sanders-rejects-ceo-martin-shkreli-campaign-donation/FcSKxu1VIr7pubg9cI3CQN/story.html", "http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/sanders-cummings-letter-to-turing?inline=file", "https://twitter.com/MartinShkreli/status/654106492732342272", "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/252473-sanders-to-introduce-bill-targeting-high-drug-prices", "https://berniesanders.com/issues/fighting-to-lower-prescription-drug-prices/", "https://twitter.com/MartinShkreli/status/652620323737763840", "http://www.businessinsider.com/why-martin-shkreli-hiked-drug-price-2015-10", "http://www.businessinsider.com/martin-shkreli-never-responded-to-bernie-sanders-about-turing-2015-10", "https://twitter.com/SenSanders", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/10/15/bernie-sanders-rejects-ceo-martin-shkreli-campaign-donation/FcSKxu1VIr7pubg9cI3CQN/story.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:26:21.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
