(Barbara J. ... more Image 12 of 12 Warriors at top of NBA preseason power rankings 1 / 12 Back to Gallery Express-News staff writer Mike Monroe ranks the NBA ’s 30 teams to start the season:\n1. Warriors\nLast year: 67-15 (won NBA championship)\nStarters: Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson , Andrew Bogut , Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes .\nArrivals: Kevon Looney, Chris Babb , Jason Thompson .\nSkinny: After one of the best seasons in NBA history, the Warriors kept the core of their young lineup intact. Defending a title is difficult but they have the makings of a dynasty.\n2. Cavaliers\nLast year: 53-29 (lost in NBA Finals)\nStarters: Mo Williams, J.R. Smith, Timofey Mozgov, Kevin Love , LeBron James .\nArrivals: Richard Jefferson , Sasha Kaun , Austin Daye .\nSkinny: They will open season with Kyrie Irving on the injured list but Williams can keep it going for a month or two. They’re the best in the East and LeBron again is on a mission of redemption.\n3. L.A. Clippers\nLast year: 56-26 (Lost in West semifinals)\nStarters: Chris Paul , J.J. Reddick, DeAndre Jordan , Blake Griffin , Wesley Johnson .\nArrivals: Paul Pierce , Cole Aldrich , Chuck Hayes, Pablo Prigioni, Wesley Johnson, Josh Smith, Lance Stephenson.\nSkinny: Was their offseason as productive as the Spurs? Maybe so if Pierce has anything left and Smith and Stephenson can fit. Tons of pressure on Jordan after the big free agent recruiting fiasco.\n4. Rockets\nLast year: 56-26 (lost in West finals)\nStarters: Patrick Beverley , James Harden , Dwight Howard , Terrence Jones , Trevor Ariza .\nArrivals: Ty Lawson , Marcus Thornton, Sam Dekker , Montrel Harrell.\nSkinny: Harden is an MVP candidate and Howard one of top 3 big men in the league. Trading for Lawson was a great addition to a team that was already loaded.\n5. Spurs\nLast year: 55-27 (lost in West first round)\nStarters: Tony Parker , Danny Green , Tim Duncan , LaMarcus Aldridge, Kawhi Leonard.\nArrivals: LaMarcus Aldridge, David West , Ray McCallum, Boban Marjanovic , Jonathan Simmons .\nSkinny: Landing prized free agent Aldridge and getting valued big man West at a bargain price gave them the most impactful off-season in the league.\n6. Thunder\nLast year: 45-37\nStarters: Russell Westbrook , Andre Roberson , Steven Adams , Serge Ibaka, Kevin Durant .\nArrivals: Cameron Payne , Josh Huestis .\nSkinny: Donovan inherits one of league’s best rosters with Durant more motivated than ever after missing last season. Having Monty Williams to help him transition to NBA will be a big help.\n7. Grizzlies\nLast year: 55-27 (lost in West semifinals)\nStarters: Mike Conley , Courtney Lee, Marc Gasol , Zach Randolph , Jeff Green .\nArrivals: Matt Barnes, Brendan Wright , Jarell Martin , Andrew Harrison .\nSkinny: The grit and grind guys are back, a year older and still lacking the 3-point game that has transformed the NBA. That is, unless they expecting Barnes to be their deep threat.\n8. Heat\nLast year: 37-45\nStarters: Goran Dragic , Dwyane Wade , Hassan Whiteside , Chris Bosh , Luol Deng.\nArrivals: Amar’e Stoudemire, Gerald Green, Justise Winslow, Josh Richardson .\nSkinny: They have had more than a year to get over the loss of LeBron James and their injury-plagued season. More importantly, they have one of the league’s rising big men in Whiteside. A return to the playoffs is a given.\n9. Hawks\nLast year: 60-22 (lost in East finals)\nStarters: Jeff Teague , Kyle Korver , Al Horford , Paul Milsap , Thabo Sefolosha .\nArrivals: Tiago Splitter, Justin Holiday , Lamar Patterson , Walter Tavares , Tim Hardaway Jr.\nSkinny: Al Horford’s return from the injured list gives them one of the best big man duos in East.\n10. Bulls\nLast year: 50-32 (lost in East semifinals)\nStarters: Aaron Brooks , Jimmy Butler , Joakim Noah , Pau Gasol , Tony Snell.\nArrivals: Bobby Portis, Christiano Felicio .\nSkinny: Another preseason, another awful injury for Derrick Rose , a fractured orbital bone (left eye). They are still second-best in the Central.\n11. Raptors\nLast year: 49-33 (lost in East first round)\nStarters: Kyle Lowry , DeMar DeRozen, Jonas Valanciunas, Patrick Patterson , DeMarre Carroll .\nArrivals: Carroll, Cory Joseph , Luis Scola , Bismack Biyombo, Norman Powell , Delon Wright , Anthony Bennett .\nSkinny: Major roster upheaval after winning division title reflects pitiful playoff performance. They acquired some veteran help that will shore up a porous defense.\n12. Pelicans\nLast year: 45-37\nStarters: Jrue Holiday, Eric Gordon , Omer Asik , Anthony Davis , Dante Cunningham .\nArrivals: Kendrick Perkins , Chris Douglas-Roberts , Alonzo Gee.\nSkinny: Gentry was their biggest offseason acquisition and he has promised to bring the approach that led the Warriors to last season’s title.\n13. Bucks\nLast year: 41-41\nStarters: Brandon Knight , O.J. Mayo, Larry Sanders , Jabari Parker , Giannis Antentokuompo\nArrivals: Greg Monroe , Chris Copeland , Marcus Landry, Greivis Vasquez, Rashad Vaughn , Shawne Williams .\nSkinny: Only once had they made a bigger single-season jump in wins over last season’s 26-game increase and that was after drafting Lew Alcindor ( Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ). Adding Greg Monroe makes them better up front.\n14. Wizards\nLast year: 46-36 (lost in East semifinals)\nStarters: John Wall , Bradley Beal, Marcin Gortat, Nene, Otto Porter .\nArrivals: Gary Neal , Kelly Oubre , Jared Dudley , Alan Anderson .\nSkinny: They’ve got the most explosive back court in the East but the Wizards don’t get enough from their bigs and they lost Paul Pierce.\n15. Jazz\nLast year: 38-44\nStarters: Trey Burke, Alec Burks , Rudy Gobert , Gordon Hayward , Derrick Favors.\nArrivals: Trey Lyles, Raul Neto, Raul Neto, Tibor Pleiss , Jeff Withey .\nSkinny: Despite losing Dante Exum (torn left ACL) for the season, they are poised to contend for a playoff berth in the ultra-competitive West.\n16. Mavericks\nLast year: 50-32 (lost in West first round)\nStarters: Deron Williams, Devin Harris , Zaza Pachulia , Dirk Nowitzki , Chandler Parsons .\nArrivals: Williams, JaVale McGee, Samuel Dalembert , Jeremy Evans , Justin Anderson , John Jenkins .\nSkinny: Check out the list of players the Mavs lost and it’s clear they are truly starting over while trying to give Nowitzki a solid supporting cast.\n17. Knicks\nLast year: 17-65\nStarters: Jose Calderon , Arron Afflalo, Robin Lopez , Derrick Williams, Carmelo Anthony .\nArrivals: Afflalo, Lopez, Williams, Jerian Grant, Kristaps Porzingis, Kevin Seraphin , Sasha Vujecic, Kyle O’Quinn , Thanasis Antentokouonmpo.\nSkinny: Phil Jackson brought Fisher some help. They’ll make a big jump.\n18. Lakers\nLast year: 21-61\nStarters: D’Angelo Russell, Kobe Bryant , Roy Hibbert , Julius Randle , Nick Young.\nArrivals: Hibbert, Russell, Larry Nance Jr., Brandon Bass, Lou Williams, Michael Frazier , Metta World Peace, Robert Upshaw .\nSkinny: There is too much uncertainty to know what to think of this roster, starting with Bryant.\n19. Kings\nLast year: 29-53\nStarters: Rajon Rondo, Ben McLemore , Kosta Koufos, DeMarcus Cousins, Rudy Gay .\nArrivals: Koufos, Rondo, Quincy Acy , Marco Belinelli, Caron Butler , Seth Curry .\nSkinny: If the players will let Karl coach them, they should contend for the playoffs.\n20. Suns\nLast year: 39-43\nStarters: Brandon Knight, Eric Bledsoe , Tyson Chandler, P.J. Tucker, Markieff Morris .\nArrivals: Chandler, John Leuer, Ronnie Price , Mirza Teletovic, Sonny Weems.\nSkinny: They broke up the Morris twins and Markieff wants out. Not the sort of drama you want at the start of a season.\n21. Pacers\nLast year: 38-44\nStarters: George Hill , Monta Ellis, Ian Mahinmi, Paul George , C.J. Miles .\nArrivals: Ellis, Myles Turner, Jordan Hill, Glenn Robinson III, Toney Douglas , Chase Budinger.\nSkinny: They open the season committed to a small-ball attack that makes Paul George a power forward, a move he doesn’t like.\n22. Nets\nLast year: 38-44 (lost in East first round)\nStarters: Jarrett Jack, Bojan Bogdanovic , Brook Lopez, Joe Johnson , Thaddeus Young .\nArrivals: Chris McCullough , Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Andrea Bargnani , Wayne Ellington , Shane Larkin , Quincy Miller , Willie Reed, Thomas Robinson , Donald Sloan .\nSkinny: Remember when confirmed bachelor Mikhail Prokhorov guaranteed an NBA title within five years with a promise to marry if they didn’t produce one? He’s still single and this year’s Nets aren’t going to threaten Prokhorov’s playboy status.\n23. Hornets\nLast year: 33-49\nStarters: Kemba Walker , Nicolas Batum, Al Jefferson , Cody Zeller , Michael Kidd-Gilchrist .\nArrivals: Batum, Frank Kaminsky , Tyler Hansbrough, Jeremy Lin , Elliot Williams, Spencer Hawes , Jeremy Lamb..\nSkinny: The Lance Stephenson experiment produced that rotten egg smell and a setback for a team that seemed on the rise.\n24. Celtics\nLast year: 40-42\nStarters: Marcus Smart, Avery Bradley , Kelly Olynyk , David Lee , Jae Crowder .\nArrivals: Lee, Jonas Jerebko, Amir Johnson , Terry Rozier , RJ. Hunter.\nSkinny: Celtics faithful hope their surge late last season portends a playoff run. Skeptics see a lineup that is a season away, even in the East.\n25. Pistons\nLast year: 32-50\nStarters: Reggie Jackson , Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Andre Drummond , Ersan Ilyasova, Marcus Morris.\nArrivals: Ilyasova, Morris, Aron Baynes, Steve Blake, Reggie Bullock, Danny Granger, Stanley Johnson.\nSkinny: Drummond is a potential All-Star and Jackson finally has his own team to run. Figuring out how this mix of players will mesh is impossible.\n26. Nuggets\nLast year: 30-52\nStarters: Emmanuel Mudiay, Randy Foye, Jusuf Nurkic, Kenneth Faried, Wilson Chandler.\nArrivals: Mudiay, Nikola Radicevic, Nick Johnson , Kostas Papanikolaou.\nSkinny: By the end of last season the Nuggets were nearly as dysfunctional as the Kings. Appropriately they hired the coach the Kings had fired.\n27. Trail Blazers\nLast year: 51-31 (lost in West first round)\nStarters: Damian Lillard, Gerald Henderson , Meyers Leonard, Ed Davis, Al-Farouq Aminu.\nArrivals: Aminu, Davis, Henderson, Phil Pressey, Mike Miller, Mason Plumlee, Noah Vonleh, Daniel Diez, Maurice Harkless, Pat Connaughton,\nSkinny: The six departed players could form the core of a playoff contender and beat the top six Blazers seven times out of 10.\n28. Timberwolves\nLast year: 16-66\nStarters: Ricky Rubio, Zach Levine, Gorgui Dieng, Kevin Garnett, Andrew Wiggins.\nArrivals: Karl-Anthony Towns, Tyus Jones, Andre Miller, Tayshaun Prince, Damjan Rudez,\nSkinny: This could be the final season for Garnett. Wiggins is an All-Star-in-waiting.\n29. Magic\nLast year: 23-59\nStarters: Elfrid Payton, Victor Oladipo, Nikola Vucevic, Tobias Harris, Aaron Gordon.\nArrivals: Jason Smith , Greg Stiemsa, C.J. Watson, Melvin Ejim, Mario Hezonja, Shabazz Napier.\nSkinny: The good news is the continuity from last season. The bad news is that’s about all the Magic have going for them.\n30. 76ers\nLast year: 18-64\nStarters: Kendall Marshall , Nik Stauskas, Jahlil Okafor , Nerlens Noel, Robert Covington.\nArrivals: Okafor, Marshall, Stauskas, Carl Landry, Gerald Wallace, Pierre Jackson, Richaun Holmes, Scottie Wilbekin.\nSkinny: Can Okafor be the franchise changer neither Noel nor Embid nor Michael Carter-Williams were?\nmikemonroe@express-news.net", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843094/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843092/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843091/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843098/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843099/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843088/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843091/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843096/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://myaccount.expressnews.com/dssSubscribe.aspx?pid=495&z=00000", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843090/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843088/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813342/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843099/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843090/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843096/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843101/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813342/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843093/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843101/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843098/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843092/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843094/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843093/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:03:22.089+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
