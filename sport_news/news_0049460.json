Comment Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 12:01 AM GREEN In the heat of summer, when they were battling their way through conditioning drills in the hot sun, the Green boys soccer team flashed a hint of what was to come. Third-year head coach Jason Nelson saw it when he watched his players showing their competitive spirit in the most mundane of drills, trying to outrun and best one another in whatever task he put in front of them. “I would say, probably early in middle of July doing fitness training … just the competitive nature of the group,” Nelson said. “We had several guys not wanting to lose even a sprint or a timed mile. I knew we had talent, but this group absolutely has that competitive fire.” That spirit has flourished this season to the tune of a 13-0-1 start, a No. 5 ranking in the most recent state poll and first place in the Federal League standings. Nelson, who was a part of the 2002 team that reached sixth in the state – the previous highest ranking in program history – and the 2003 team that reached the regional finals, has seen the Bulldogs submit the best start in program history in their first season in the Federal League. With 13 wins, Green has surpassed the total that 2002 team posted, but Nelson insisted the Bulldogs are happy to abide by the clichés that cause sports fans and many athletes to roll their eyes. “We obviously talk about it, but sometimes talking about it isn’t enough … we’re all about one day, one game and one practice at a time. Sometimes kids scoff at that, but we welcome the process of the day by day,” Nelson said. It’s hard to argue with the results that clichéd approach has yielded. In addition to their unbeaten record, the Bulldogs lead the Federal League and are one win from clinching the league title in their first season as a member. According to Nelson, the team wasn’t worried about being able to compete in their new home league because they had played most of its teams in previous seasons. While their lofty ranking and perfect record might lead some to believe that the Bulldogs would revise their goals and start dreaming of state championships, that isn’t the case. Before the year, the Bulldogs established goals of winning a league championship and capturing a district title, both of which are well within reach. Although they have a healthy respect for reigning league champions Jackson, the Bulldogs were adamant that they wanted to make a statement that they would be a force in the Federal League and they have delivered on that goal. When their mounting win total finally earned them a spot in the Ohio State Soccer Coaches Association poll, it was an exciting moment. Page 2 of 2 - “On Monday when they saw it, they were extremely excited,” Nelson said. “They were very, very pumped and they knew we have achieved so much so far, but they’re also hungry for trophies and they took it in stride because they knew that the target on our backs just quadrupled in size.” Senior captains Zach Hillman and Isaac Schott have been the driving forces on the field for Green, both in terms of leadership and production. Hillman (18 goals, 9 assists) and Schott (7 goals, 6 assists) have shown the ability to both find the back of the net and create scoring chances for their teammates. They have great support from the back line of the defense, comprised of players such as Matthew Wilson and Damjan Djosanovic, with senior goalkeeper Christian Galayda behind them. Galayda is “a calming presence” at the back of the defense, according to Nelson. With four games remaining in the regular season, Green is looking to lock down a league crown while getting ready for the postseason, where an unbeaten record won’t guarantee them much beyond a first-round bye. They’ve already accomplished enough to rank among the best teams in program history. They don’t know what lies ahead, but the Bulldogs are OK with living out the cliches that have gotten them this far. Reach Andy at 330-580-8936 or andy.harris @thesuburbanite.com.
