That included those in sports who have been diagnosed with cancer, such as Indianapolis Colts coach Chuck Pagano and Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders. \nFarrell says he heard from former Red Sox manager Terry Francona every day since August. \nBut Farrell says the biggest surprise came from Yankees fans: “It certainly gives you a boost.” \n© Copyright 2015 Associated Press.
