When former Patriots and current Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis lines up across from him, he’ll be facing the best offense he has seen all year.\nAnd so the Jets-Patriots matchup will be a proving ground for both groups, because, frankly neither has been greatly tested by their opponents so far. The Patriots are scoring the league’s most points per game, and the Jets have allowed the fewest.\n Here are the keys to a Patriots victory over the Jets.\n1. Don’t throw at Darrelle Revis\nUnless it’s Rob Gronkowski.\nBecause of his size, Gronk is one of the only players in the league who may have an advantage against Revis. However, Revis likely won’t be tasked with covering Gronk—at least not on every play—and so Brady would be wise to throw away from the shutdown corner.\nFor whatever reason, quarterbacks haven’t gotten the memo about Revis this season. And he’s caught three interceptions.\nRedskins quarterback Kirk Cousins seemed to forget where Revis was on the field, and threw the ball to a receiver in the flat. Pick.\nColts quarterback Andrew Luck threw downfield to rookie Phillip Dorsett covered by Revis. Pick.\nDolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill targeted Revis in the redzone (WHY!?). Pick.\nRevis’s secondary is so good, Ryan Fitzpatrick has led three of the Jets’ five games in passing. Yes, the Ryan Fitzpatrick.\n2. Get LeGarrette Blount and Dion Lewis involved early and often\nThe Jets defense has allowed the fewest yards per game, second-fewest passing yards per game, and second-fewest rushing yards per game.\nThere isn’t one particular way to beat them.\nThe first place to start, however, is with the Patriots’ running backs. New England can start by getting Lewis in space as a receiving threat — there isn’t a linebacker on the Jets (and perhaps in the NFL) that can cover him. Then they can counter with Blount, whose quick feet and tree-trunk legs should challenge the tackling ability of the Jets’ elite group of linebackers.\n3. Figure out the left tackle situation\nAgainst the Colts, Marcus Cannon was in for a handful of snaps before leaving the game with an injury, at which point Sebastian Vollmer moved to left tackle and Cameron Fleming moved to right. It’s likely the Patriots will want to Cannon back at left tackle, if he’s healthy .\nBut there may not be a worse game for Cannon to get his sea legs at left tackle. The Jets’ defensive front is one of the best in the league. Defensive end Sheldon Richardson said the Jets are “ licking their chops. ”\nWith the way the Patriots offensive line has looked through five games, he’s got good reason to be excited.\n4. Pressure and contain Ryan Fitzpatrick\nChris Ivory has been the most important offensive player for the Jets, and the Patriots will struggle mightily to stop him.\nBut the Patriots have an easier target.\nFitzpatrick has thrown an interception in each of the Jets games this year. He follows the line of Jets quarterbacks where there’s little question as to whether he’ll turn the ball over. Instead, it’s a matter of when he’ll do it. To encourage Fitzpatrick to turn the ball over, Chandler Jones and Jamie Collins will need to get after Fitzpatrick, while containing him pocket to prevent him from scrambling. In the last two games, Fitzpatrick has rushed for 65 yards and a touchdown.\nThe more he’s throwing the ball, the better off the Patriots are.\n5. Get the ball in Gronk’s hands\nAnd good things happen.\nFor the first three games, Gronk caught four touchdowns and was averaging over 100 yards per game. In the last two games, he’s caught one touchdown and averaged 58.5 yards. He went the first half against the Colts without a catch.\nEven when Gronk isn’t racking up yards, he’s invaluable.\nWhen opponents dedicate quality and quantity personnel to covering Gronk, it’s easier for Brady to go elsewhere (to Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, or even Scott Chandler). But the Jets are deep enough in the secondary, and Brady may not have that luxury. They Patriots will need him to create separation and get yards after the catch.\nPlaying both sides: These guys have worn Patriots and Jets colors\nPrevious -- of -- Next Ty Law spent 10 seasons with New England after getting drafted in the first round of the 1995 draft and won three Super Bowls.
