After returning from banishment to Triple-A, Ozuna batted .278 with six home runs and 18 RBI in 44 games, a marked improvement from the .249, 4, 26 in his first 79. \nHe drove in the winning run in a Marlins’ comeback with a ninth-inning single in the final series at Philadelphia. He finished strong, batting .301 in September/October. \nJennings said Ozuna’s biggest improvement “has been shrinking the strike zone. He’s not chasing some of the pitches he did earlier in the year that got him in trouble. You’re starting to see that, especially in run-producing situations. \n“That’s where he needs to make his money and be clutch is those opportunities to drive runs in.” \nIt remains to be seen whether Ozuna will have a chance to do so in Miami. He turned down the chance to sign a long-term contract before this season, and is represented by hard-nosed agent Scott Boras. \nThe Marlins reportedly were open to trading Ozuna prior to the July 31 non-waiver deadline. He could be utilized in a deal for an established pitcher in the offseason. \nThe risk is in dealing a young player who may blossom into an All-Star at a time when his value is down. \n“The bat and the ability to hit has been a work in progress. Defensively, he came into [spring training] a little bit overweight. He dropped the weight and is showing the ability in center field that he’s always had,” Jennings said, adding that the Statcast assessment is not out of line with what Ozuna could become. \n“To be mentioned on that list with some of those guys is tremendous, and it shows the league recognizes his true ability.” \nCldavis@tribpub.com; CraigDavisRuns@Twitter.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:29:40.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
