The mayor's office had questioned the ordinance's legality, but declined to offer how it will move forward given the council's veto-proof majority vote.\n\"The mayor will consider his options,\" said Fischer spokeswoman Margaret Brosko.\nAt issue is the city's operation of Neighborhood Place --a more than two-decade partnership with the state, Jefferson County Public Schools and nonprofit groups-- which the mayor's office has said needs to be reevaluated.\nMetro Community Services Director Katina Whitlock told the council in September the city would postpone its plan to overhaul the eight sites, which included reducing the number of metro employees from eight to two as part of a larger realignment review.\nThe members who favored the proposal said it was important to send the mayor a strong message given how his office handled the changes, which did not include informing council members or Neighborhood Place partners.\n\"I think we really felt like we were duped,\" said Councilman Steve Magre, D-10th.\nSeveral Neighborhood Place supporters attended the council meeting and said the actions by Fischer's office underscored a lack of transparency and communication, especially in terms of social services to the poor.\n\"Twenty to three, that's pretty strong rejection,\" said Carolyn Franklin, who sits on one of the center's community councils. \"It shows it's a pretty big deal because because the way the director of community services handled this is baffling, insulting and absolutely appalling.\"\nFischer administration officials repeatedly said throughout the week the measure was an unnecessary step given their assurances that they would consult with the council before moving on any changes to the centers.\nNo timeline has been established on when the city will revamp its agreement on Neighborhood Place operations, and Whitlock said in an email to council members this month that a meeting with the other agencies this month was poorly attended.\nCouncilman David Yates, D-25th, said members ought to table the measure and meet with Fischer before passing a measure that will create a rift with the mayor.\n\"Let's start at saying we trust the administration,\" Yates said. \"I'm scared to say we can't.\"\nLater during the debate Yates said he was unaware of an email from Whitlock telling employees not to discuss the changes. He ultimately voted for the measure.\nCouncil Democrats Tom Owen, Brent Ackerson and Bill Hollander voted against the ordinance.\nReporter Phillip M.
