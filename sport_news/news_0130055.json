It’s the lifeblood of the sport, moving it forward and pushing new boundaries.\nGus Kenworthy has certainly done that on the slopes.\nOn Thursday, he did it again — and in a more meaningful way than adding another spin or rotation. Kenworthy became the first action sports athlete to openly come out as gay, first telling his story to ESPN The Magazine .\n“I feel just amazing to have it out there,” Kenworthy said in a phone interview. “It feels like a huge weight’s been taken off of my shoulders. I’ve been completely floored by the response that I’ve gotten, everyone’s been so supportive and so kind with what they’ve said.”\nAfter Kenworthy revealed the news, he was met with support. Tweets from Chloe Moretz, Miley Cyrus, Jason Collins and so many others poured in.\nIt extended to the action sports community, where athletes applauded Kenworthy’s decision.\nSage Kotsenburg, the snowboarding slopestyle Olympic champion in Sochi, tweeted, “Gus you are the man! So proud of you for this I know it couldn't have been easy but we're all supporting you #GoGus”\nUSA TODAY\nSochi pups are doing great as skier's season kicks off\n“This is huge and I’m so happy for Gus,” said Joss Christensen, the Olympic gold medalist who along with Kenworthy and Nick Goepper led the USA to a sweep in the event’s debut.\n“It’s almost kind of putting it in everybody else’s face and saying, ‘Hey, I don’t care what you think. This is me, and I love who I am.’”\nAction sports athletes are part of a culture that frequently uses gay and derogatory terms as a synonym for stupid or uncool. Michael Spencer, Kenworthy’s agent, doesn’t believe that’s out of maliciousness but acknowledges that hearing that has had an impact on Kenworthy.\nBut to Kenworthy, the goal is more than just changing the language that is used. It’s setting an example.\nThe media tour following his Olympic silver medal and the U.S. sweep was a turning point. For the first time, he was being asked about his private dating life, and he felt disingenuous by omitting the truth of who he is.\n“More so than that change or that shift, I guess the biggest thing that I wanted was to try to just show people that this is not something that should be hidden,” said Kenworthy, 24. “I had such a hard time as a kid and I think if there had been someone like me when I was a kid to look up to, someone who had come out in this sport, it would have saved me a lot of heartache and I would have come to terms at a much younger age.”\nGus you are the man! So proud of you for this I know it couldn't have been easy but we're all supporting you #GoGus https://t.co/jclEbTrhzX\n— sage kotsenburg (@sagekotsenburg) October 22, 2015 That’s exactly the type of example others noted. With his platform — an Olympic medalist whose stardom rose after he rescued a family of dogs from Sochi — he can reach so many more people, Spencer said.\nSaid freeskier Tom Wallisch, “I’m really happy mainly just for him but also the sport and our culture. It’s really hard in action sports. Your image is so linked to being crazy and cool and traveling the world hooking up with girls.\n“It’s really awesome to see him coming out like that and setting a good example. It’s really admirable.”\nBefore he medaled in slopestyle’s Olympic debut, Kenworthy had been the first to land a triple cork in a slopestyle run. Last season, Kenworthy put down a Grand Prix halfpipe run in Park City that was the first to include four double corks.\nAlthough he has not won an X Games medal, Kenworthy was the Association of Freeskiing Professionals’ top athlete for a fifth consecutive year. He is the only athlete who is consistently a threat in the sport’s three disciplines — halfpipe, slopestyle and big air.\nAs he told ESPN, it was when he was on top that he wanted to come out. And he hopes his journey will someday pave the way for athletes for whom their sexuality won’t be news.\nUSA TODAY\nMiley Cyrus shows some love for Olympic skier Gus Kenworthy\nSpencer said he’ll look forward to seeing how the action sports community responds, especially with Kenworthy as a threat in each of the X Games’ Freeskiing events. But he also expects to see a lighter Kenworthy, relieved of the stress of feeling like he had to keep who he is a secret.\n“I don’t want to say come out of his shell because he’s never been shy,” said Spencer. “He’s going to become even that much more engaging and charismatic because now he doesn’t have to worry about if he messes up and says something about a boyfriend.\n“Now I think you’re just gonna get the last 10 percent that everyone’s been missing knowing who the real Gus is.”\nThe concerns he voiced in the ESPN The Magazine story — namely the uncertainty of response he would get from sponsors and the freeskiing community — aren’t gone. The response was overwhelmingly positive initially, but Kenworthy points out that it had only been six hours since the article was published.\nCould he be the happier person, unburdened by worry about that reaction? He thinks so, and that’s a big step forward.\n“I don’t know exactly how everything will change, but I just know that I already feel a burden taken off of me and I’m just looking forward to the rest of my life,” Kenworthy said. “I’m ready to embrace who I am and be comfortable in my skin and see where it takes me.”\nI am gay. pic.twitter.com/086ayvChq2\n— Gus Kenworthy (@guskenworthy) October 22, 2015 170 CONNECT 65 TWEET LINKEDIN 55 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1RYGvSj", "external_links": ["https://t.co/jclEbTrhzX", "https://twitter.com/guskenworthy/status/657213362137272320", "http://usat.ly/1RYGvSj", "https://t.co/086ayvChq2", "https://twitter.com/sagekotsenburg/status/657225213193555968", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2d3f851771f01174caad4c98290ac00328eb4fe3/c=1182-0-5022-3840/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/11/24/635524410043327328-Gus-Mishka-Jake3-RobinDMacdonald.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2015/10/22/miley-cyrus-applauds-gus-kenworthy/74408532/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c1956c51aecb8fa6af1f0c367c812b8db4bf6d28/c=146-505-2029-2388/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811252350264912-GTY-493261568-76838308.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RYGvSj&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoGus?src=hash", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b590c73a380c9e9a0b407cafacedbe92323ef2c/c=125-0-2240-1590&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811101506487097-B02-PUPPIES-A-14-61936788.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811101506487097-B02-PUPPIES-A-14-61936788.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e355eea8ef62c48bada3b44bf7172a519a234f84/r=500x336/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811101506487097-B02-PUPPIES-A-14-61936788.JPG", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2014/11/24/sochi-pups-gus-kenworthy-humane-society/19481805/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RYGvSj&text=Olympic%20medalist%20Gus%20Kenworthy%20floored%20by%20response%20after%20coming%20out&via=enquirer"], "published": "2015-10-23T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:12:08.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
