We’ll turn up on Sunday, put some new tyres on, go and play again. \n“Everyone remembers Sunday, not Saturday.” \nWinterbottom’s nearest rivals made the most of his costly mistake. \nStablemate David Reynolds came home second behind Van Gisbergen while Bathurst champion Craig Lowndes wasn’t far behind in third. \nIt means Lowndes is now 306 points behind Winterbottom with Reynolds a further 24 points adrift. \n“I’m delighted it’s always a great feeling when you’re on the podium at a place like the Gold Coast,” Lowndes said. \n“To end up third is great for the championship.” \nLowndes’s teammate Jamie Whincup had an even worse day than Winterbottom, finishing 24th after co-driver Paul Dumbrell was involved in an early collision which left their Commodore damaged. \nThe Gold Coast 600 wraps up on Sunday with qualifying before another 300km race in the afternoon.
