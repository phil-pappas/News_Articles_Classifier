He tweeted on Friday questioning whether or not he could convince 200-plus politicians to write him in for the empty Speaker of the House seat.\nHe said the Constitution says he can try to make it happen.\nMaybe I'll run for Speaker of the House. Can I convince 200+ politicians to write me in? Constitution says I can try. If not me how about?\nâ€” Mark Cuban (@mcuban) October 9, 2015 While he was probably only joking about throwing himself deep into the political world, he did say that he gets asked about running for president every day. He said it was a fun idea and that if he ran as a Democrat, he could defeat Hillary Clinton. He also said if he ran as a Republican, he could crush Donald Trump. He added that rich people believe they know more than everybody else, which leads to a little more arrogance in general.\nFrom the Dallas Morning News :\nCuban gets asked all the time to run for President of the United States.\n\"I get asked every day,\" Cuban told CNBC.com recently. \"It's a fun idea to toss around. If I ran as a Dem, I know I could beat Hillary Clinton. And if it was me vs. Trump, I would crush him. No doubt about it.\"\nCuban was asked about Trump, especially his \"three-comma\" net worth (billionaire), which gives Trump a certain swagger.\n\"Rich people just have a little more arrogance to think we know more than everyone else,\" Cuban said.\nWe certainly know Cuban is opinionated about many things. If he ended up being President Cuban, it would be a lot easier for him to get the Mavericks invited to the White House than just waiting to win a championship like they accomplished during 2011. I don't think we'd have to see him sell the Mavs to do the job either.\nSenator Herb Kohl was in office from 1989 to 2013 and owned the Milwaukee Bucks from 1985 to 2014 when he sold the franchise for $550 million. That's not a bad return on investment considering he purchased them for $18 million in 1985. Maybe the Mavs being owned by the president could increase the value of that franchise even more? Mark Cuban running for president is an interesting idea.
