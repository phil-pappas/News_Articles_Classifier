The 34-year-old Frodeno completed the 2.4-mile ocean swim, 112-mile bike leg and marathon run in 8 hours, 14 minutes, 40 seconds. He was second after the swim and took the lead for good 95 miles into the bike leg.\nWith temperatures on the course in excess of 120 degrees, Frodeno finished the swim in 50:50, the bike ride in 4:27:28 and the run in 2:52:22.\n\"I had good run form, but it was brutal,\" Frodeno said. \"No shade at all. If you're going uphill, your heart rate goes up and it just doesn't come back down.\"\nFrodeno, who was third last year, also is the reigning Ironman 70.3 world champion and won the gold medal in th 2008 Beijing Olympics.\nGermany's Andreas Raelert was second, and American Timothy O'Donnell finished third.\n\"By far it's the best performance I've had here,\" O'Donnell said. \"Andy is a great competitor. He came up to me really close in the Energy Lab, but I was able to pull away. I soon paid for that effort.\"\nDaniela Ryf of Switzerland won the women's race for her first Ironman title.\nRyf was among the first women out of the water and finished in 8:57:57, more than 12 minutes ahead of second-place Rachel Joyce of Britain.\n\"I'm so happy. It was such a hard day. Everything went perfect. I had a bit of luck and last 2 k I had a flat tire and could only roll in,\" Ryf said. \"I could put it together in such an amazing atmosphere.\"\nLiz Blatchford of Australia was third in 9:14:52.\nEach year, more than 110,000 athletes vie for slots in the event. More than 2,300 triathletes started the race Saturday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:33:07.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
