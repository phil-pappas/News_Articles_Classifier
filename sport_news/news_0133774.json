Johnson had two touchdown catches to help the Indianapolis Colts beat the Texans, 27-20, Thursday night in Houston.\nJohnson, who spent his first 12 NFL seasons in Houston before he was released in March, pushed the lead to 27-17 with a 2-yard touchdown reception from Matt Hasselbeck in the fourth quarter. Johnson, 34, finished with six catches for 77 yards.\nHasselbeck, 40, was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck may not have been 100 percent either, after missing practice Tuesday with an illness.\nThe Colts (3-2) extended their AFC South winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games.\nBrian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Paterson's Mike Adams with less than two minutes left.\nTITANS' McCOURTY READY: Titans cornerback Jason McCourty finally is ready for his season debut Sunday, even though the veteran hasn't taken a hit harder than what teammates muster up in padded practices.\nMcCourty, a former Rutgers and St. Joseph Regional star, isn't saying if he's 100 percent following groin surgery Aug. 24. When asked about his health, McCourty has a short answer:\n\"I'll be out there. That's all that matters.\"\nThe Titans (1-2) can use the cornerback who has started 72 of the 90 games he's played over the past six seasons, including every game the past three years. McCourty has 11 career interceptions and has forced six fumbles. \nCUTLER ON THE MEND: Bears QB Jay Cutler said the strained hamstring that kept him out two weeks ago is improving even if it's not quite 100 percent heading into Sunday's game at Kansas City.\n\"I feel better, I do, still not exactly where I want to be,\" he said. \"But ... we have a lot of guys banged-up out here so just make do.\"\nThe Bears (1-3) have been racking up injuries at a rapid rate, particularly on offense.\nTop receiver Alshon Jeffery has been sidelined since the opener by a hamstring problem, and Eddie Royal has an ankle injury.\nCOWBOYS' LEE RETURNS: LB Sean Lee returned to the field for the first time since suffering a concussion in the first quarter of the Cowboys' overtime loss to New Orleans on Sunday.\nLee, who is going through the NFL's protocol for head injuries, was active in drills during the portion of the practice open to the media.\nThe linebacker appears to be on track to play Sunday against New England and line up alongside Rolando McClain, who returned this week to the active roster following a four-game drug suspension. Lee and McClain have never played a down together.\n\"Everything is optimistic,\" Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said before practice. \"He'll be limited, but we're optimistic with how he has responded to everything.\"\nNot seen participating in practice were receivers Dez Bryant (foot) and Brice Butler (hamstring), tight end James Hanna (ankle) and defensive end Randy Gregory (ankle).\nDOLPHINS FIRE AIDE: Dolphins defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle was fired by new interim coach Dan Campbell. Lou Anarumo was named his replacement.\nCoyle was widely criticized for the decline of the defense since he joined the Dolphins in 2012. Miami (1-3) ranks last in the NFL in rushing defense at 160.5 yards per game.\nINFANTE DIES AT 75: Former NFL coach Lindy Infante died Thursday, his wife said. He was 75.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:10.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
