It’s not easy. Add that to the fact that Brian White does such a remarkable job coaching that team. They rarely if ever make any mistakes.”\n In the latest computer ratings, Liberty is second in Division I, Region 1 and Davidson is third in Region 2. The Liberty offense, scoring 30.4 points per game, will try to dent a Davidson defense that has allowed just 28 points all season.\nBest of the rest Independence (6-1, 4-0) at Eastmoor Academy (4-3, 3-1) Independence’s path to its first City League title since 2003 is hardly easy. The 76ers must beat three one-loss South Division teams (Eastmoor Academy, 11-time defending champion Marion-Franklin and Walnut Ridge) in succession on the road. Eastmoor has won eight straight in the series.\nJohnstown (7-0) at Licking Valley (5-2), 7 p.m. Six of Johnstown’s wins have come over teams with winning records, but this might be its toughest challenge. Valley has won both meetings since the reformation of the Licking County League. The Panthers’ final three opponents are a combined 18-3.\nWesterville Central (7-0, 4-0) at Westerville South (3-4, 2-2) Central can’t afford to look ahead to its game next week against unbeaten Hilliard Darby. South is playing better of late, as evidenced by a 28-21 overtime loss to Darby last week.\nBexley (6-1, 3-0) at London (5-2, 1-2), 7 p.m. London’s Michael Johnson (2,162 yards, 22 touchdowns) is on pace to break 3,000 yards rushing, but he faces a Bexley defense allowing just 12 points per game and that has had three shutouts in a row.\nGrandview (6-1, 3-1) at Madison Plains (4-3, 1-2), 7 p.m. Ninth in its region, Madison Plains is trying for its first playoff appearance. A consolation prize would be its first winning season since 1991.\nHamilton Township (5-2, 3-1) at Bloom-Carroll (5-2, 3-1), 7 p.m. Both teams are in playoff position, waiting for Logan Elm to fall from its perch alone atop the Mid-State League Buckeye Division standings.\nHartley (4-3) at Watterson (4-3), 7 p.m. Despite dropping three of four, Hartley is still in good shape to make the playoffs thanks to an ambitious schedule. The Hawks’ OHSAA-sanctioned opponents are a combined 31-12. Ninth in its region, Watterson is more desperate.\nLogan (6-1) at DeSales (6-1), 7 p.m. DeSales’ defense is peaking, having allowed seven points in each of the past three games. This is an important game for Logan, which won’t gain many computer points in closing with two winless teams.\nWatkins Memorial (5-2, 1-1) at Granville (4-3, 0-1), 7 p.m. Both teams need to win if they hope to return to the playoffs. Granville has won the past two meetings.\nsblackledge@dispatch.com\n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:42:42.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
