Texas Tech needs a win to rise from the bottom of the Big 12 standings. A homecoming loss against Iowa State would destroy any momentum Texas Tech established in its three-game stretch of Arkansas, TCU and Baylor. The Red Raiders are 7-1 against the Cyclones at Jones AT&T Stadium and have not lost to Iowa State during head coach Kliff Kingsbury's tenure. Texas Tech needs three more wins to become bowl eligible and it must start with a victory against Iowa State on Saturday.\nWhen Iowa State has the ball\nKeep an eye on freshman Mike Warren. Warren started Iowa State's last two games at running back and rushed for more than 100 yards against both opponents , becoming the first Iowa State freshman to do so. Texas Tech struggles against the run; the Red Raiders are allowing opponents an average of 277 yards per game this season. Warren will have an impact on the pace of Iowa State's offense. If the freshman can move the chains on key third downs and keep Sam B. Richardson in a position to make quick reads, the Cyclones can change the tempo of this game with long, drawn-out possessions.\nDon't blink, you might miss Mike Warren turning the jets on for this 62-yard #Touchdown run. @CycloneFB up 24-0. http://t.co/eV5gG1Y28N\nâ” Big 12 Conference (@Big12Conference) October 3, 2015 When Texas Tech has the ball\nFollow the trenches. Kliff Kingsbury said sophomore right guard Justin Murphy will be out against Iowa State after suffering an injury in Texas Tech's 63-35 loss against then-No. 5 Baylor. Senior center and team co-captain Jared Kaster is not concerned about Murphy's injury affecting the cohesion of the offensive line. \"We're going to be prepared,\" Kaster said. \"If somebody goes down it's the next man up.\" Kingsbury identified Arlington-native Tony Morales, freshman Robert Castaneda and senior Emeka Okafor as the potential candidates to replace Murphy on Saturday, adding junior receiver Dylan Cantrell and Agyle graduate Ian Sadler will both be out of the lineup, as well. Senior DeAndre Washington has an opportunity to pass Baron Batch and move into eighth place among Texas Tech's all-time leading rushers with 68 yards. Winning the game is the top priority but Washington could be in for another career day provided the offensive line can win at the point of attack.\nPrediction\nTexas Tech must avoid dropping to 0-3 in Big 12 play at all costs. The Red Raiders take the field for homecoming on Saturday with an added sense of determination and desperation coming off back-to-back losses against AP Top-25 opponents, eager to prove they are not regressing back to last season's 4-8 team. Washington rushes for more than 100 yards but does not eclipse the 186 he rushed for last season against Iowa State while sophomore Patrick Mahomes continues working back to full strength. Texas Tech wins this game if the Red Raiders can control the line of scrimmage, avoid turning over the football (Tech had four last week against Baylor) and keep Mike Warren out of the endzone.\nScore: Texas Tech 38, Iowa State 23\nFollow Mike DuPont on Twitter at @MikeDuPont_\nMORE TEXAS TECH CONTENT:\nFive things fans need to know about Iowa State, including Dale Pierson's sack habit\nTexas Tech quotable: Defense remains in search of consistency, update on Mahomes' status\nTexas Tech picks up commitment from five-star Frisco OL Jack Anderson\nBest in Texas (10/5): Baylor, TCU in fight for top spot; Houston gains ground on Texas Tech\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/05/texas-tech-picks-commitment-five-star-frisco-ol-jack-anderson", "https://twitter.com/CycloneFB", "http://t.co/eV5gG1Y28N", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-105-baylor-tcu-fight-top-spot-houston-gains-ground-texas-tech", "https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Touchdown?src=hash", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/05/texas-tech-quotable-defense-remains-in-search-of-consistency-update-on-mahomes-status", "https://twitter.com/Big12Conference/status/650371211180937216", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/06/five-things-texas-tech-fans-need-know-iowa-state-including-dale-piersons-sack-habit"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:09:18.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
