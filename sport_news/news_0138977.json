He finished the season hitting .255 with four home runs and 32 RBIs with a .287 on-base percentage. Rios was injured on the team’s first road trip of the year when he suffered a broken bone in his hand after being hit by a pitch in Minnesota. The injury kept him out until late May. \nRios, who signed a one-year deal worth $11 million this past offseason, made a solid first impression with the club, hitting a home run on opening day and posting a .321 batting average with eight RBIs before the injury. \nBut when he returned, Rios struggled greatly, hitting .189 in June. He also lost playing time to 29-year old rookie Paulo Orlando. Rios, though, eventually bounced back and hit .297 in July, .264 in August and .288 in September. \nRios missed the first week with chickenpox, and the Royals also went into a swoon before bouncing back and finishing the year 95-67 and winning their first division title in 30 years and clinching home field throughout the playoffs. \n“Every team at some point is going to struggle with injuries, and you’re going to go through bad stretches and it’s just part of the game,” Rios said. “It’s how you bounce back, and I think we’ve always bounced back very well and that’s something that has given us character. Even when we faced those injuries, we’d find ways to win and it’s very satisfying to be able to contribute somehow to winning. \n“That’s your main goal when you start the season. You want to have a good season so you can help the team win games and achieve a common goal that is going to the playoffs. Even with the injuries we’ve had, we had some young players stepping in and filling the holes to replace the players that were hurt. And I think that we have a good bench.” \nOrlando figures to be part of that bench in the postseason. Orlando hit .249 with seven homers and 49 RBIs in 86 games. \n“I’m pretty excited for the playoffs,” Orlando said. “We were very fortunate to do a good job this year like they did last year. We started pretty good this season and just never stopped playing hard. We just tried to give 100 percent and that’s what we’ll do in the playoffs and that’s going to be neat to see.” \nWhen Rios signed with the club as a free agent, he believed the Royals had what it takes to make it back to the postseason. And early in spring training, he knew he was right. The Royals are the only AL team that is in the playoffs for the second year in a row. \n“When I was getting to know the team and getting to know everybody, I saw that this team had a winning culture,” Rios said. “When you have that, that’s a good sign that good things are going to happen. From the beginning of the season, we would always find ways to win, and we play with a lot of energy and those are always signs of success.” \nPEP RALLY TUESDAY — The Royals will be having a special “Take the Crown” pep rally at 12:15 p.m. Tuesday at Kaufman Stadium. The event is free and open to the public. Stadium gates open at 11:15 a.m. General manager Dayton Moore and manager Ned Yost will have a news conference beginning at 11:45 and it will be shown on CrownVision. The Royals will then hold batting practice from 1 to 2:15 p.m. \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:07:05.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
