Kyle KeenerLewis Cass junior Cail Brown, shown running earlier this season, finished 11th with a time of 16:45 Saturday at the Culver Academies Regional to advance to the New Prairie Semistate. Posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 12:36 am PREP ROUNDUP: Semistate bound From Staff Reports Pharos-Tribune \nSeveral area cross country runners have secured their spot at the New Prairie Semistate. \nThe boys teams from Winamac and Logansport placed fourth and fifth, respectively, Saturday at the Culver Academies Regional to advance. \nThe top five teams and top 10 individuals on non-advancing teams advanced to next Saturday’s New Prairie Semistate. \nA pair of freshmen led the Loganland contingent at the regional. \nCaston freshman Mitchell Rans led the area boys with a fourth-place finish in 16:15, and Lewis Cass freshman Miah Martin paced the area girls with a third-place finish in 19:31. \nRochester senior Wesley Meyer won the boys race in 16:00. He was followed by a pair of Warsaw runners ahead of Rans. \nWarsaw won the team title with 46 points, followed by semistate qualifiers Rochester (72), Culver Academies (90), Winamac (91) and Logansport (145). \nZen Zupin led the Warriors with a sixth-place finish in 16:25. He was followed by Kyle Collins (9th, 16:39), Braden Tankersley (24th, 17:31), Joe VonTobel (30th, 17:45), Michael Beckner (33rd, 17:51), Henry Antrim (67th, 18:57) and Dylan Perry (88th, 20:07). \nJacob Graf led the Berries with an eighth-place finish in 16:34. He was followed by Jacob Hoover (23rd, 17:31), Ryan Lythgoe (32nd, 17:47), Kenny Echols (54th, 18:38), Fabian Luna (57th, 18:41), Kyle Army (72nd, 19:05) and Trevor Benn (76th, 19:32). \nLogansport coach Chuck LaDow was happy to see his team advance to the semistate. \n“That was our goal from the beginning of the season,” he said. “Jake Graf was sick this week. I thought he would contend for the title but I was just happy he was able to run in the top 10. He really wasn’t feeling well and had a fever at Thursday’s practice. You can tell when kids aren’t feeling well. \n“Another faux pas was our No. 4 guy, Alan Jiminez, who has been consistently getting better, broke his toe on a cabinet at his house before the race. ... Our No. 8 guy, Kennedy Achey, was sick, so our No. 9 guy was our No. 7. All things considered, we ran very well, very hard.” \nThe Berries beat Kokomo by nine points to gain the final spot in the semistate. \nCass’ Cail Brown placed 11th in 16:45 to advance. Caston’s Jacob Maroney placed 34th in 17:55 to join Rans and grab the final individual semistate qualifying spot. \nPioneer placed eighth with 165 points. Jacob VanHorn led the Panthers with a 42nd-place finish in 18:14, followed by Matt Williams (43rd, 18:18), Owen Bice (47th, 18:23), Blake Montgomery (59th, 18:44), Caleb Phillips (68th, 18:58), Eli Roberts (81st, 19:44) and Jared Spencer (85th, 20:00). \nCaston’s Santiago Henderson placed 49th (18:26), and Cass’ Lucas Bowman placed 60th (18:48) and Hayden Vest placed 80th (19:41). \nWarsaw won the girls regional title with 25 points, followed by semistate qualifiers Manchester (92), Western (119), Northwestern (141) and Maconaquah (145). \nWarsaw sophomore Mia Beckham (18:53) and junior Anna Craig (19:17) placed 1-2 in front of Cass’ Martin. \nJoining Martin as semistate qualifiers from the Loganland area were Winamac’s Claire Collins (6th, 19:39), Logansport’s Isabelle Crain (8th, 20:00), Pioneer’s Madison Kiser (13th, 20:22) and Caston’s Adrianna Dague (15th, 20:33). \nCulver Academies’ Stephanie Ma grabbed the final individual spot in the semistate with a 23rd-place finish in 20:53. \nLogansport placed seventh as a team with 164 points. Crain was followed by Jen Kreighbaum (33rd, 21:25), Megan Benn (43rd, 21:37), Abbi Zartman (53rd, 22:04), Cassidy Kestle (64th, 22:25), Gracie Musselman (69th, 22:58) and Ashlyn Lythgoe (73rd, 23:16). \n“The girls are disappointed that they didn’t qualify as a team for the semistate because that was our goal going into the season, but we ran pretty well and just came up a bit short on finishing in the top five teams,” Logan coach Brian Morrill said. “Isabelle Crain ran better than we expected by placing eighth overall. It was her best time ever on the Culver course and she was 18 seconds faster than she was in last year’s regional. If she can run 18 seconds faster next week than she did a year ago at the semistate it should put her at the state meet this year. Nothing is guaranteed and each week you have to go out and get the job done, but Isabelle will give it her best effort. \n“Jen Kreighbaum and Megan Benn ran exceptionally well. Both of these girls are such hard workers. Jen improved her times by around a minute each race from a year ago and last year Megan was on our JV team and running in the 25s. She has been in the 21s several times this year and is our most improved runner. \n“We will lose Jen Kreighbaum, Ashlyn Lythgoe and Gracie Musselman to graduation and they have contributed a lot to our team over the past four years. They are model student-athletes and rank toward the top of their class academically. We will miss them next year.” \nWinamac placed ninth with 187 points. Claire Collins was followed by Jaydyn Scott (28th, 21:01), Lilly Linch (42nd, 21:34), Sara Bailey (72nd, 23:05), Emily Downing (87th, 25:44) and Hayden Warner (88th, 26:54). \nPioneer’s Kayla Hill placed 46th (21:40), Caston’s Evelynn Byrum placed 52nd (21:56), McKenzie Paschen was 59th (22:18) and Sidney Berry was 68th (22:56) and Cass’ Morgan Mundy was 70th (22:59) and Alexis Jackson was 77th (23:31). \nVolleyball \nCass County Tourney \nPioneer repeated as county champions by defeating Cass 25-17, 25-18 in the opening round and Logansport 23-25, 25-18, 15-10 in the championship round at Caston. \nPioneer coach Rod Nies said there is a lot of improvement to do before the IHSAA Tournament starts next week. \n\"We played pretty decent for the most of the match against Cass,\" Nies said. \"We wore them down on our serves and serve receptions. In the match against Logansport we came out flat. They played us tough. After losing the first set, we had to come back and win the second and third set.\" \nMikenna Landis led Pioneer with 48 assists, 22 digs, three kills and three blocks on the night.
