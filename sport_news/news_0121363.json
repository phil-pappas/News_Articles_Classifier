Every year is different,\" said Amy Prol, a member of all three title-winning teams.\n\"It was more fulfilling, the win this year,\" added Liz Byrne, also a part of the three titles.\nThe game was, as expected, a defensive struggle. There was little open space to be found, much less open shot attempts. Amanda Fortemps turned in a great effort at right midfield, as did Alison Duffy at left back for the Patriots. Allison Badami and Prol had major defensive impacts, including Prol’s key clearance moments before the goal.\nThe goal could not have been scripted better. Byrne, after being lauded all year for her efforts despite Amanda LaGuardia doing most of the Patriots’ scoring, scored the winner with 10 minutes remaining in regulation.\n\"It doesn’t really matter to me to show up in the box score,\" Byrne said, \"the fact that the team came together is more important.\"\n\"We’re not certainly going to give up now, we want to advance in the state tournament,\" Prol said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:33:42.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
