After two seasons in Oakland, Gordon jumped to the Steelers then Titans before landing with the Chiefs in March as an unrestricted free agent.\nIn 34 career games, he has recorded 14 yards on four receptions with one touchdown.\nIn addition to playing tight end, he has also played fullback and special teams, recording 18 career tackles.\nThe transaction comes less than a week after Henry, a waiver claim from Green Bay, was kept over veteran tight end/fullback James Casey when the Broncos had to clear a roster spot for defensive end Derek Wolfe. The move appeared to signal the Broncos' appreciation for Henry, a player they had hoped to sign as a college free agent following the 2015 draft.\nCoach Gary Kubiak has long been fond of versatile tight ends, but the Broncos' offensive struggles this season have extended to the group; Owen Daniels, a 10th-year veteran, is 12-of-26 on targets this season (he was 0-for-5 at Oakland) for 61 yards and two touchdowns.\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:18:46.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
