Claus, whose driver's license bears his legal name of Santa Claus, is the former president of the North Pole Chamber of Commerce.\nTwo seats on the City Council are up for election. No one filed for office, however, during the regular filing period.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Clause is the former president of the North Pole Chamber of Commerce, not the current president.\nCopyright The Associated Press\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://is.gd/xdaqmI)"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:11:17.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
