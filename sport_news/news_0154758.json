These treatments are designed to enhance the body’s natural ability to heal and can result in eliminating or delaying the need for surgery.\nRMI also offers combination therapy of surgery and adult stem cells from the patient’s own bone marrow. Studies have been shown that the use of stem cells in addition to surgery can both speed up and result in more complete healing.\nSpeakers include:\nNeil Riordan, PhD –“ Why Stem Cells Work: Clinical Trials for Spinal Cord Injury, Autism, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.”\nDr. Riordan is co-founder of the Riordan-McKenna Institute in Southlake, Texas. He is the also the founder of the Stem Cell Institute and Medistem Panama.\nWade McKenna, DO – “Potential of Stem Cells to Enhance Surgical and Non-Surgical Outcomes in Sports Injuries and Orthopedic Procedures.”\nDr. McKenna is co-founder of the Riordan-McKenna Institute. He is also the founder of McKenna Orthopedics in Decatur, Texas.\nRoger Nocera, MD – “Stem Cells: Cells That Heal Us From Cradle to Grave”\nDr. Nocera is the author of “Cells That Heal Us From Cradle To Grave: A Quantum Leap In Medical Science. He is founder and president of Amnion Cytokine Therapy and was formerly the chief medical officer of Medistem, Inc.\nOur speakers will be on hand afterwards for a meet and greet. Light snacks will be served.\nAdmission is free but space is limited and registration is required.\nSuccessfully-treated MS, autism and orthopedic patients will be on hand to share their experiences.\nFor venue information and to register and reserve your tickets today, please visit: https://rmiclinicdallas2015.eventbrite.com or call Dusty Taylor, Patient Events Coordinator at 1 (877) 899-7836.\nAbout Riordan-McKenna Institute (RMI)\nRMI specializes in non-surgical treatment of acute and chronic orthopedic conditions using *AlphaGEMS flowable amniotic tissue allograft and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) that is harvested using the BioMAC (Pat. Pend.) bone marrow aspiration cannula. Common conditions treated include meniscal tears, ACL injuries, rotator cuff injuries, runner’s knee, tennis elbow, and joint pain due to degenerative conditions like osteoarthritis. RMI also uses AlphaPATCH amniotic membranes as part of a complete wound care treatment regimen.\nRMI also augments orthopedic surgeries with BMAC and AlphaGEMS to promote better post-surgical outcomes.\nBMAC contains a patient’s own mesenchymal stem cells (MSC,) hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+), growth factors and other progenitor cells. AlphaGEMS is composed of collagens and other structural proteins, which provide a biologic matrix that supports angiogenesis, tissue growth and new collagen during tissue regeneration and repair.\n*Amniotic Therapies Inc. produces AlphaGEMS and AlphaPATCH products from donated amniotic tissue after normal healthy births.

In close collaboration with universities and physicians world-wide, our comprehensive stem cell treatment protocols employ well-targeted combinations of autologous bone marrow stem cells, autologous adipose stem cells, and donor human umbilical cord stem cells to treat: autism, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, and autoimmune diseases.\nIn partnership with Translational Biosciences, a subsidiary of Medistem Panama, SCI provides clinical services for ongoing clinical trials that are assessing safety and signs of efficacy for autism, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and spinal cord injury using allogeneic umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) and hU-MSC-derived mesenchymal trophic factors (MTF). In 2016, Translation Biosciences plans to expand its clinical trial portfolio to include heart disease and cerebral palsy.\nFor more information on stem cell therapy:\nStem Cell Institute Website: http://www.cellmedicine.com\nStem Cell Institute\nVia Israel & Calle 66\nPlaza Pacific Office #2A\nPanama City, Panama\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13009699.htm\nInformation contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.
