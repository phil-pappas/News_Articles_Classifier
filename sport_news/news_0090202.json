However with the temperatures topping the 85 degree mark with a 20 mph wind, VanderLinden said Stumph’s score was good considering the conditions. While finishing in a seven-way tie for 34th place with a 21-over par 93, Stumph will have some catching up to do on Day 2 while trailing the leader, India Gaume of Pembroke Hill, who shot an even par 72 on the first day. “The round took over six hours to play,” VanderLinden said. “McKenna was playing her best round of the year for the first 12 holes, but it is hard to maintain your concentration for that long and fatigue set in for her and the other golfers in her group. Of the 89 golfers competing, there are 40 scores of 93 or better. There are seven golfers with a score of 93. Hopefully, she will continue to play well and finish stronger on Wednesday.” In the team standings after Day 1, MICDS leads a field of eight other schools with a score of 338. Pembroke Hill is currently in second place with a score of 341, followed by Helias at 363, St. Dominic at 366, Smithville at 374, Richmond at 380, John Burroughs at 382, Logan-Rogersville at 389 and Brookfield at 425. As for the top 10 golfers, Gaume’s score of 72 leads the field by one stroke over Lyndsey Nicole Standage of Logan-Rogersville, who finished the first day with a 1-over par 73. Haleigh Berrey of Father Tolton currently stands in third place with a score of 76, followed by Olivia Sobaski of Sacred Heart in fourth place with a score of 77, Shannon Gould of MICDS and Olivia Laub of Barstow tied for fifth at 78, Allison Bray of Cape Girardeau Notre Dame in seventh place with a score of 79, Sarah Bell of Cape Girardeau Notre Dame in eighth place with a score of 80 and Samantha Cornelius of Penney, Shannon Fang of Pembroke Hill, Maggie Moore of Seneca, Lauren Plunkett of Helias and Abigail Grace Schroeder of MICDS tied for ninth with a score of 84. In Class 2 after Day 1 at Rivercut Golf Course in Springfield, Warrensburg leads in the team standings with a score of 331. Marquette is currently in second place with a score of 336, followed by St. Joseph’s Academy at 339, Notre Dame de Sion at 344, Rock Bridge at 348, Blue Springs at 361, Camdenton at 369 and Ft. Zumwalt South at 371. In individual scoring, Taylor BeDell of Warrensburg leads the field with a 1-under par 71. However only three strokes back with a score of 74 are Aristelle Kae Acuff of Kickapoo, Mckenna Rae Montgomery of Westminster Christian Academy and Rebecca Li-jia Su of Parkway West.
