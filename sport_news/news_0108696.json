(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) more > By FOSTER NIUMATA -   \nLONDON (AP) - New Zealand advanced its Rugby World Cup title defense to the final by overcoming archrival South Africa 20-18 in the wet at Twickenham on Saturday. \nThe hype around this first World Cup matchup in 12 years between the teams that have combined to win four titles was exceeded as they wrestled in an atmosphere thick with tension. \nDespite both teams enjoying advantages in key areas, they managed to cancel out each other’s edge. \nThe All Blacks enjoyed a majority of possession and territory, but the Springboks tackled to a standstill. \nThe All Blacks scored two tries, but their ill-discipline gave the Springboks six kicked penalties. \nThe All Blacks stole four lineouts, but the Springboks earned a scrum tighthead and vital scrum penalties. \nThe All Blacks had a man sin-binned and conceded three points. South Africa had a man sin-binned and conceded only three, too. \nIn the last minute, it was the All Blacks who put up a wall as the South Africans tried to run out of their 22 and still could find no way through, their hopes of a third cup triumph washed away with a last knock-on. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:46:26.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
