The 16th seed continued to make costly errors, including hitting a loose forehand long, and Djokovic earned another break and a 3-love lead. \nTrailing 5-1 in the opener, Tsonga showed some fight with a punishing forehand winner. But that only prolonged the inevitable, as the Serb took the next game at love, to win the first set 6-2. The second set was a far tighter affair with Tsonga limiting his errors and looking more confident from the baseline as he whipped a forehand cross court for a winner; he went 4-3 in front. \nBut in the ninth game, Djokovic found an opening, from the baseline the world number one unleashed a wicked forehand winner, getting him a vital break. Djokovic then served for the match, and clinched the game at love when the Frenchman's return went long. The Serb won 6-2, 6-4, securing his ninth title of the year. \nDjokovic then wrote a Chinese character meaning “happiness” on a camera. The title is his 25th Masters success in all, and he is now 10-0 in ATP World Tour Finals in China, with this his third Shanghai triumph.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:55:35.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
