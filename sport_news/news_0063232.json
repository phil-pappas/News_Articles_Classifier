It’s just those situations are just, you know -- It deflates you. It hurts our whole team.”\nAt South Carolina Kentucky quarterback Patrick Towles threw an interception on Kentucky’s third offensive play of the game, two plays after a drop by wide receiver Dorian Baker on a potential long gain. A week later against Florida Towles threw another interception on the offense’s opening drive – this time two plays after Baker dropped a possible touchdown pass in the end zone.\nThe Wildcats made it through the first drive against Missouri without any drops or turnovers, but against Eastern Kentucky the problem returned when Badet fumbled on a 9-yard gain while trying to stretch for a first down.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK backup receivers looking for more snaps\n“It’s not like the kid was trying to fumble,” Dawson said. “The kid was trying to get extra yards. He was playing hard. There’s times where the ball just gets hit perfectly and gets knocked out. Obviously we’re going to teach ball security and we do. We teach and preach and coach ball security. It sucks when it happens at that time.”\nBadet’s reception marked the third consecutive 9-yard gain for a Kentucky offense that appeared to find an early groove before the fumble. After that turnover much of the offensive success disappeared with the Wildcats punting on each of the next two offensive drives.\nAsked if he felt snake bit after the third opening-drive turnover in five games, Dawson said he didn’t think much of anything after the play.\n“I’m just like, ‘Well, that’s interesting,’“ Dawson said with a laugh.\nHe did admit the early mistake affected his play-calling on subsequent drives and could have contributed to Towles’ early struggles against EKU.\n“The first drive we’re being patient, we’re getting 10-yard chunks and we fumble, and the second drive I say, ‘All right we’re going to get big and be big boys out here.’“ Dawson said. “Then we get like a yard. So then I just start throwing it down the field. It probably has to do with my patience”\nEmail Jon Hale at jahale@courier-journal.com .
