Coweta"], "text": "Comments \nWith only four teams participating in the Region 3- double-elimination softball tournament this week, both top-seed East Coweta and No. 3-seed Newnan are guaranteed to be one on the 32 teams headed to the GHSA state tournament next week. \nHowever, when the three-day event begins Tuesday at East Coweta, there will still be plenty left to play for with teams not only vying for a region title, but home-field advantage in the postseason. \nNewnan (14-5, 5-2) enters the region tournament as the No. 3 seed and will take on No. 2 seed South Cobb (19-9, 5-2) starting at 4:30 Monday, while East Coweta (25-2, 7-0) plays No. 4 seed Westlake (13-3, 5-2) at 6:30. \nEast Coweta’s has rolled through the bulk of its schedule, and comes into the tournament ranked No. 1 in the country among fall prep programs by MaxPreps. \nThe Lady Indians lost early in the season to rival Northgate, and fell to West Laurens last month in tournament play to account for their only losses. \nEast Coweta has the makeup of a team that could make a deep postseason run. The Lady Indians have scored 10-runs or more in seven games this season. \nVeteran head coach Franklin DeLoach has also been able to use three pitchers for most of the season in senior right-hander Morgan Goree, lefty Rachel Vaughan and freshman star Kelley Lynch. \nTogether, the trio have combined for 15 shutouts. \nEast Coweta has also done an ample job replacing a strong senior class. \nTransfer Dani Morgan, who previously had verbally committed to Florida State, has stepped in and filled an opening at shortstop last held by LSU freshman Shemiah Sanchez. \nIn its regular-season meeting with Westlake, the Lady Indians defeated the Lady Lions 13-0 in a game called after four innings. \nNewnan comes into the tournament with revenge on its mind after finishing in a three-way tie for second place during the regular season. \nSouth Cobb, with help from a 10-2 victory over the Lady Cougars early in the 3- schedule, was able to secure the No. 2 seed in the tournament. \nThe Lady Cougars had only six hits in a regular-season meeting with South Cobb and made three errors. \nNewnan has relied on the arm of Addie Andrews, who has pitched all but two of the team’s 140 innings, while striking out 85, walking 25 posting a 2.58 ERA. \nOffensively, the Lady Cougars are led by senior Hannah Scarbrough, who has verbally committed to play at Georgia Southern. She comes into the tournament with a .482 average with 23 RBIs and four home runs. \nLeslie Davis leads Newnan with a .351 batting average along with five homers and 13 RBIs. Katelin Richardson has a team-high 15 RBIs with two homer, while Maysen Willard is batting .333. \nWednesday’s schedule begins with an elimination game at 4:30 to decide the No. 4 seed, followed by the winner’s bracket semifinals. \nThe final day opens with a third-place game at 4:30 p.m., with the winner advancing to the 6:30 p.m. finals. \nA third game, if necessary, will follow directly afterward.
