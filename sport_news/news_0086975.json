By Troy Hyde Newton Daily News \nDIKE — Collins-Maxwell/Baxter freshman Ian Thomson doesn’t feel any pressure following in the footsteps of his older brother Colin. \nAfter qualifying for the state cross country meet as a freshman Thursday, he probably feels even less pressure. \nColin Thomson ran in the state meet last year and is now running collegiately at Central College, but Ian Thomson is continuing the family tradition and even has the chance to one up his older brother with three years left to run on the state’s biggest stage. \nWith four ranked teams and two “teams to watch” in attendance, Ian Thomson expected things to be tough at Fox Ridge Golf Course. His expectation was correct, but the freshman still managed to sneak into the Class 2A state field with a 14th-place finish. \n“It feels amazing,” Thomson said. “This was a really tough field, and I wasn’t sure what to expect. State will be tougher. I will just try to do the best I can and finish as high as I can.” \nThomson crossed the line in a personal-best time of 17 minutes, 32 seconds and had room to spare, finishing four seconds in front of the 15th and final qualifier. \n“Ian ran a great race today,” CMB coach Jerry Meinerts said. “I’m so proud of his desire to just keep getting better. He keeps working all race long. He was about 20th after one mile and 17th after two miles. Then all the sudden he was in the top 15 and wasn’t letting anyone pass him there at the end.” \nCMB junior Heather Jessen also advanced to her first state meet with a 12th-place finish in the girls 5K race. Thomson’s twin sister, Brenna, came across in the most unenviable position when she hit the line in 16th. \nThe top three teams and the top 15 individuals advance to the Iowa High School State Cross Country Championships in Fort Dodge on Oct. 31. \nCMB’s girls squad came into the day ranked 12th. The Raiders were the third highest ranked squad in a field that included six ranked teams and a “team to watch.” \nThe Raiders top four runners finished in the top 24 positions, but the teams ahead of them had better runners in the final three spots. \nNo. 2 Osage won the meet easily with 32 points, while host and No. 9 Dike-New Hartford (95) and No. 13 Grundy Center/Gladbrook-Reinbeck (97) also earned state berths in the top three. Unranked South Hardin was fourth with 105 points, while CMB ended up fifth with 113. \n“It was really a bittersweet night for the girls,” Meinerts said. “On one hand, I am so excited for Heather to qualify individually. She has worked so hard to get to this point and to see all of her hard work pay off was a great accomplishment for her. \n“But on the other hand, we were disappointed to not make it as a team. There were so many evenly matched teams that we knew we had to run a perfect race, and it just wasn’t our night.” \nNo. 14 East Marshall (125) and No. 15 West Marshall (171) were sixth and seventh, respectively. \nJessen earned her first-ever state meet berth by completing her 5K in a personal-best 20:28, while freshman Brenna Thomson crossed in a personal-best 20:41, which was one second behind East Marshall’s Melinda Puumala for the final qualifying spot. \n“It feels pretty good because this is the first time I have ever made it to state in anything,” Jessen said. “We really wanted to go as a team. But we are fairly young so we can build on this experience and hopefully advance next year.” \nFreshman Shasta Moody was 22nd in a personal-best 21:02 and freshman Lauren Ratliff, who battled shin splints at the end of the year, was 24th in a personal-best 21:06. \nSenior Chasity Moody was the fifth and final counting place for the Raiders. She was 42nd in a personal-best 22:10. Juniors Anna Jones and Winter Brown also ran personal-best times, crossing in 55th and 56th, respectively. \n“The hard part about the whole race was that every one of our girls ran their best times of the season,” Meinerts said. \nOsage’s Megan Mooberry, who is ranked second in Class 2A, won the race in 18:50. Fourth-ranked Haley Fye of East Marshall was the runner-up in 19:06. \nOsage also grabbed third, seventh, eighth and 13th to win. Grundy Center/Gladbrook-Reinbeck’s top four runners were faster than Dike-New Hartford’s top four, but the Wolverines edged out the Spartans because its top two runners were fourth and fifth, respectively. \nThe Wolverines’ fifth runner was 31st, while the Spartans’ No. 5 runner was 32nd and South Hardin’s final counting runner was 34th. \nThe CMB boys finished ninth as a team with 233 points. No. 5 Clear Lake’s top five runners were in the first 18 positions and won the meet with 62 points. \nAplington-Parkersburg’s C.J. May, who is ranked No. 2, won the boys’ 5K race in 15:56 and helped the 10th-ranked Falcons to second with 79 points. East Marshall’s Nick Meling, who is ranked fifth, led the defending state champion Mustangs to the third state-qualifying spot. \nCMB sophomore Max Van Maanen was the Raiders’ second runner behind Ian Thomson. Van Maanen finished in 25th with a personal-best time of 18:07. Sophomore Carter Fricke was next in 37th in a personal-best 18:29. \nThe final two counting runners were freshman Josh Bruntz in 77th and sophomore Noah Rhoades in 80th, respectively. Freshman Eric Wagner (84th) and junior Brady Ross (95th) also ran for CMB. Rhoades and Wagner ran personal-best times. \n“Our boys ran great tonight,” Meinerts said. “We were shooting for eighth or better and came up just short of that goal. There was some great competition, and our boys brought their ‘A’ game and really competed with these rated teams.” \nBoth Raider teams competed in bright orange socks and bright orange head bands in honor of senior Stephanie Twohey, who lost a close family friend to Leukemia earlier in the week. \nThe Class 2A state meet takes place at Fort Dodge’s Lakeside Municipal Golf Course. Jessen and the 2A girls will run at 1 p.m., while Ian Thomson and the 2A boys begin their race at 1:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:27:46.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
