After an unlikely sequence that included a long touchdown off a trick play, a failed two-point conversion and a recovered onside kick, the Redskins were trailing the crown jewel of the Mother Lode League 28-27. Quarterback Dylan Byrd took the snap from the Calaveras 40-yard line, rolled to the left and threw it to wide receiver JJ Gonzalez, who was running a deep corner route. When it came down, it landed in the arms of a Wildcat defender. Devastation. “They covered it well. I was trying to force it, trying to make a play. They came out on top,” Byrd said of the interception that sealed the defeat. “It sucks, and anybody would tell you the same thing. It sucks, but you can’t change it now. I know it’s hard but you just have to move on and get ready for next week and the rest of the league.” In an up-and-down game that saw the Redskins lead 14-7 at halftime, lose the lead shortly after a failed fake punt attempt deep in their territory in the third quarter and have two opportunities to take the lead late, Calaveras ended up on the wrong end of the arrow. “It’s hard, but you know that your kids played their heart out for you,” said head coach Jason Weatherby. “That’s all you want, win, lose or draw, is for them to fight, and you want them to leave it all on the field. And they did.” Though the rivalry has been fairly one sided since its inception — with Sonora coming out victoriously five-of-six times since 2010 — the Redskins came into the game on Friday expecting to win. “It was an expectation. We don’t go into games expecting to lose,” Weatherby said. “The expectation is we’re going to win. We’re going to fight as hard as we can to win, do everything we can to win.” The Redskins emerged from the visitor’s locker room at Dunlavy Field as they always do — silently — although Friday was a little different. As they walked to the far goal post, they seemed decisive, confident and determined — like any great warrior prior to a fierce battle. “This has been a good week in practice. The kids were fired up, they listened, they were focused,” Weatherby said. “They played disciplined.” Tight end Shane Torre scored two touchdowns for the Redskins. “His game was huge. He played real well,” Weatherby said. Torre also recovered a fumble on defense as the Wildcats were going to score in the first half. “He got open and he actually made some catches in traffic. The guy was big,” Weatherby said. Next week, the Redskins will face Argonaut in San Andreas.
