The cracks have appeared already. \nThose with their fingers on the pulse at Anfield â€“- former defender Jamie Carragher among them -- have taken a swipe at FSG's running of the club in the wake of Rodgers' departure. \n\"They've made a lot of decisions since they've come that haven't worked,\" said Carragher, who highlighted the sackings of Damien Comolli and Kenny Dalglish, as well as the failings of the club's transfer committee. \n\"At this moment the owners' track record in making decisions for Liverpool Football Club over the last two or three years has not been good enough. It is miles off. \n\"What are these owners of the club going to do to get Liverpool back where they need to be?\" \nIt is hard to disagree with Carragher's assertion that the five-time European champions have become a club seemingly in a permanent state of transition during Rodgers' spell in charge. \nAnd whoever takes over will face many of the issues that so challenged Rodgers, particularly with regard to the nuances of Liverpool's recruitment department. \nAlthough he has been swimming against the tide, Rodgers can count himself unfortunate. \nAny manager would have found it difficult to replace talents of the calibre of Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling and Steven Gerrard, not least when transfer decisions were made by committee. \nManaging Liverpool, one of world football's most iconic clubs, can be seen as a dream job. \nBut marry the level of expectation and the weight of history with the modern constraints, and it can quickly seem something of a poisoned chalice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:21:22.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
