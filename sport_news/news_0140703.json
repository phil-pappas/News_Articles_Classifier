But to be able to go (68 yards) was a testament to the team. The kids just stepped up and it was fantastic.”\nOn the game-winning drive, which began with 2:08 remaining, the biggest play was a 28-yard first-down pass from Keough to junior Manning Sears (six catches, 137 yards, three TD), which brought Marblehead (4-1, 3-0) inside the 5-yard line.\n“That was a big play for us,” said Rudloff. “In the past when we get that close to the goal line, we don’t throw the ball, but with Garret, everything has changed because he can make the reads and we have receivers that can catch the ball.”\nThe visitors raced out to a first-quarter lead when Keough found Sears for a 9-yard TD to cap a six-play, 40-yard drive that started after Craig recovered a Beverly fumble. The Magicians made it 14-0 on their next possession when Keough again hit Sears, this time down the seam for a 45-yard score.\nBut Beverly (4-1, 2-1) answered on its opening drive of the second quarter, Kevin Morency hitting Matt Madden for a 5-yard score. Following an interception by Hugh Calice on Marblehead’s ensuing drive, Madden raced 35 yards up the middle to bring the Panthers even heading into the break.\nSam Abate (114 yards rushing) gave Beverly a 21-14 lead with a 50-yard TD run on the third play of the second half, but Keough found Sears for a 34-yard score later in the quarter. A failure on the kick set the stage for Marblehead’s late comeback.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:34:35.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
