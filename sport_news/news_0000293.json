This is totally arbitrary, and my numbers would be slightly different if I did this again in five minutes. It’s purely for fun, for discussion, for a time-waste. \nI’ve looked at the remaining schedules of the 12 unbeaten FBS college football teams and decided who has the best route to a perfect record at the end of their regular-seasons. I assigned what I felt was the likely winning percentage to each of the Dandy Dozen’s remaining games, multiplied them, and came up with what I call the HR (Hlog Rankings) Block. \nFour teams have just four games left instead of five, which obviously helps their chances. Ohio State and Michigan State are 8-0. LSU and Toledo are 7-0, but had their season-openers cancelled because of inclement weather. They would have won those games (at home against McNeese State and Stony Brook, respectively), anyway. \nThe following is the HR Block, with the percentage for victory I’ve assigned for each game. I’ll explain my numbers in some places, but not in most. Life is too short. \n1. Clemson .301 \nat N.C. State 72 percent \nFlorida State 75 \nat Syracuse 85 \nWake Forest 98 \nat South Carolina 67 … If Clemson is 11-0 going into this game, this should probably be more like 80 percent or more because South Carolina could be playing out the string by then. Maybe it is already. \n2. Ohio State .296 \nat Illinois 80 \nMichigan State 65 \nat Michigan 60 … This may be low. The Ohio State we saw Saturday night at Rutgers looked a lot like the wrecking machine of last January. \n3. Houston .239 \nVanderbilt 79 \nCincinnati 79 … There are some very competitive teams in the American Athletic Conference besides unbeatens Houston, Memphis and Temple, and Cincinnati is among them. \nMemphis 55", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:28:21.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
