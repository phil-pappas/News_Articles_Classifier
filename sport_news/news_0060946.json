Red Cross has announced they received more than $40,000 in donations for victims of the South Carolina flooding.\n\"LSU fans were enthusiastic about giving this weekend as they welcomed the Gamecocks to Baton Rouge,\" said Merri Alessi, executive director of the American Red Cross in the Louisiana Capital Area. \"Fans had their wallets open, checks written and stories to share.\"\nRed Cross volunteers were on hand at entrance gates to collect donations. Individuals made online contributions to the Red Cross as well.\n\"It was wonderful to experience the graciousness and support of our community for a disaster we’re all too familiar with,\" said Blanche Harvey, who is serving her 18 th year as a Red Cross volunteer. \"We give our time as volunteers, but we know that we can’t provide for the disaster services without donations.\"\nHarvey was among the 40-plus Red Cross volunteers, including LSU Army ROTC, supporting the fundraising effort at Tiger Stadium.\nRome Gautreau, a 7-year-old volunteer who collected donations alongside her parents and grandmother, whispered to her mother after another $100 bill was put in her can, \"We’re giving the people in South Carolina so much help.\"\nRed Cross volunteers, including 16 from Louisiana who deployed to the Carolinas, are supporting people affected by flooding – and your help is still needed. The Red Cross depends on the continued support of the public to help people affected by disasters big and small.\nPeople can help by donating to Red Cross Disaster Relief to support disasters big and small by visiting redcross.org , calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or texting the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation.
