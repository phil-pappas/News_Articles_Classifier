Not so when it comes to Boston College.\n“Our standards are always high. . . . So we had a team that finished second in the league and made the NCAA tournament — those are achievements, but our standards are that we want to win trophies,” said BC coach Jerry York, whose top-ranked Eagles open up tonight at Army.\n“When you wake up every day, that’s want you want to do. In some years you’re not going to be able to do that, but so be it. The next day you start all over again. But it’s non-negotiable as far as we’re concerned. We want to have the success that brings trophies.”\nGoals, of the red light variety, ultimately proved the Eagles undoing last season. BC scored 107 goals a year ago, down from the 164 it managed in 2013-14 when Hobey Baker Award winner Johnny Gaudreau was on the scene, and 157 in 2012-13 when it won its fifth national title.\nNine players, including two goaltenders and two early professional signings (defensemen Michael Matheson and Noah Hanafin), are gone from that club. But a potent freshmen class has caused a renewed bounce in York’s step.\n“The addition of nine freshmen to our roster, they’ve brought not only a lot of enthusiasm and newness, but also really good hockey skills to our program,” said York, who is 16 wins shy of 1,000 for his career. “That combination of veterans all coming back in much better shape and playing better hockey, and the influx of first-year players is key.”\nDespite losing two talented defensemen, York likes what he has back on the blue line.\n“I think our captain, Teddy Doherty, has had a remarkable summer, as far as getting in better shape physically and his leadership skills have been pretty impressive early. I think that junior class of defensemen with (Ian) McCoshen, (Steve) Santini and (Scott) Savage, are three reliable and veteran guys that have played close to 80 games at this level.”\nYork said junior goaltender Thatcher Demko has progressed well from labrum surgery on both his hips, and is healthy and ready to resume his duties.\nOn offense, York feels he has a nice mix of players, with juniors Adam Gilmour, Ryan Fitzgerald and Austin Cangelosi joining the likes of assistant captain Chris Calnan and two talented sophomores, Zach Sanford and Alex Tuch.\n“I think you need that balance between creative, game-breaking type forwards and the really strong, hard-nosed, win those one-on-one battles type of players,” said York.\nIt’ll be interesting to see who of the big freshmen class make a name for themselves early.\n“I like our group there. (Miles) Wood, (Jeremy) Bracco, Colin White, the next Brown here, Chris Brown. JD Dudek has had a good start. So, it will be interesting to see how they develop,” York said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:04:17.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
