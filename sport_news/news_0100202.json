GIRLS SOCCER: Oliver Ames takes down Canton Comment By Greg Dudek Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 10:48 pm Updated at 2:56 AM EASTON – What happened Tuesday could be the confidence boost that Oliver Ames High girls soccer head coach Britt Sellmayer was seeking. The Tigers faced off against Canton at Valentine P. Muscato Stadium in a battle of the top two teams in the Hockomock League Davenport Division, but it turned into a one-sided affair. The Tigers pounced on the Bulldogs from the get-go, notching a 5-0 win behind two goals from sophomore Jacqueline Mills to extend Oliver Ames’ unbeaten streak to 12 games. “We’re playing really well,” Sellmayer said. “We’re playing good soccer right now. We’re getting close to tournament and it’s working on consistency. For us, it’s confidence and composure. We’re a good team, but sometimes I don’t think we know we’re a good team.” Oliver Ames (12-1-2, 10-1-2 in the Hockomock) went to work early against Canton (9-4-1, 9-4-0), striking in the sixth minute. Junior Kiana Lozzi took a shot from about 20 yards out and placed it perfectly in the top right-hand corner to beat the keeper and stake the Tigers to a 1-0 lead. For most of the first half after Lozzi’s goal, the two teams went back and forth, unable to take control. But with less than two minutes left in the first frame, Mills capitalized off a Canton turnover deep in the Bulldogs’ zone and lofted a shot from the edge of the 18-yard box over the keeper’s head for a 2-0 advantage going into halftime. “It was a good start for us to get that goal early,” Sellmayer said. “Kiana volleyed that ball in and it was a pretty goal from about 18, 20 yards out. That goal late in the second half in the last two minutes by Jackie was huge. I told them when we talked at halftime, ‘We’re up 2-0 and we really haven’t played well.’” Again, both teams went a long stretch of play in the second half without finding the back of the net until the Tigers finally broke free to put the game away.

Oliver Ames scored three goals in the final 10:51 of regulation, starting when junior Lauren Wright put home a rebound off a shot from Mills to extend the lead to 3-0. “In the second half, I think once that third goal came in we felt comfortable and we just played well,” Sellmayer said. Just over three minutes later, Mills scored her second goal of the game, taking a pass from Lozzi and going free into the box before firing a shot low into the corner to go up 4-0. Oliver Ames capped the scoring in the 77th minute when senior Samantha Bamford dribbled through two defenders and dished off a pass to junior Victoria Wyman at the top of the box. Wyman’s shot went off the crossbar and into the back of the net. While the offensive outburst at the end was a nice exclamation point to the win, it wasn’t necessary with the Tigers’ defense shutting down the Bulldogs’ attack. Seniors Delaney Benton, Kasey Hayes and Erin Fitzgerald along with freshman Zoe Chazan held down the back line in front of the goalkeepers: sophomore Reagan Benton, who played the first half, and freshman Bethany Dunk, who closed things out. “Our back four has come together the last couple of games,” Sellmayer said. “A big part of only giving up five goals this year is we do have great keepers, but we have a solid defense in front of that to limit the chances.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:54:12.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
