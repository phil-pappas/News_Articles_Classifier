She has one more tournament scheduled next week in Tianjin, China, and could still qualify for the WTA Finals in Singapore, though her loss to Pavlyuchenkova dented her chances. \n\"There is nothing going to change if I go to Singapore or not. My career is going to be over anyway,\" she said. \"Of course, is going to be nice to go to Singapore. If I make it, it's OK. If I don't, I go on vacation.\" \nPennetta left the door open a crack ever so slightly for a possible return next year to play at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. \n\"At the moment I don't have any idea to change my mind,\" she said. \"I cannot tell you how I'm going to feel in February, January. If I feel want to play, if I want to play, I play. I don't have to keep just one decision because I said something.\" \nWimbledon finalist Garbine Muguruza of Spain clinched her spot at the WTA finals with a 1-6, 6-2, 6-1 win over Mirjana Lucic-Baroni. \nIn other men's matches, Fabio Fognini, Pennetta's fiance, rallied to beat seventh-seeded David Goffin of Belgium 6-2, 2-6, 6-2, and Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay edged Ivo Karlovic 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7). \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:03:25.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
