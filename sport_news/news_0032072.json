A transgender woman who committed suicide penned a moving final note urging readers to change the society that drove her to step into oncoming traffic last week.\nAshley Hallstrom detailed her struggle with depression in an Oct. 14 suicide note posted to Facebook . The 26-year-old Utah woman was hit and killed by a dump truck when she walked onto a highway later that day.\n“From a very young age I was told that people like me are freaks and abominations, that we are sick in the head and society hates us. This made me hate who I was,” she wrote. “Please share my final words. I believe my last words can help make the change that society needs to make so that one day there will be no others like me.”\nHallstrom wrote that while she was born male, she always knew she was female.\n“This caused me to become severely depressed from a very young age,” she wrote. “I tried so hard to be just like everyone else but this isn't something you can change.”\nShe said she came out as transgender when she was 20, started transitioning and was “genuinely happy.”\nStill, she struggled with mental illness, she said.\n“Despite this huge change in my life I never completely got over the depression being trans caused me,” she wrote. “Everywhere I'd turn I'd see the hated that society had for us. I had already been poisoned by a society that didn't understand us and, even worse, didn't want to even try.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/ashley.hallstrom.9/posts/922143587875778?pnref=story"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:15:38.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
