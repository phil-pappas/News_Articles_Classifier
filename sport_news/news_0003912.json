You lose two games and now you start asking what changes need to be made and what needs to be done.\" \nHopefully something can be done sooner than later as, at press time, the Mounties are 9-2-1 (8-1-1 SEC-American) and hold a three-point lead over the Ridgers with two league games remaining. MHS can lock up the division title by winning its remaining two league games against Nutley and Livingston. \nMontclair was also seeded No. 1 in the upcoming Essex County Tournament, and will open up play next weekend. \nAfter outscoring their opponents 31-5 through nine games, the last three have seen the Mounties allow seven while scoring only two. \nOver the past few games, it's almost as if an entirely different Montclair squad is out on the pitch. Give credit to Glen Ridge for playing well but Montclair was definitely not playing as well as everyone knows they can. While, outside of the Northern Highlands game, the defense is still doing a good job at shutting down their opponents, the offense needs to regain their footing if they want to end the season strong and have a chance at repeating as champions. \n\"Teams want to beat us,\" McOmish said. \"There's still a long season to go. Hopefully we can bring an attitude to the rest of out games.\" \nMuch like last time Montclair and Glen Ridge faced off, it was a war for the ball as neither team backed down. Montclair won their last meeting 2-0 and was hoping for the same result but Glen Ridge came out strong. The Ridgers knew exactly what they had to do, learning from their past mistakes, and limited open space and did a good job applying pressure to the Mountie forwards, forcing bad passes. \nOn one end, the Mounties succeeded at limiting Ridger ball movement down field while, on the other, the Ridgers and goalie Ryanne Ege forced long, simple shots and did a good job shutting down Montclair corner kicks. \nThe second half continued the trend set in the first with both sides still failing to break past the other. It wasn't until the 59th minute that the Ridgers got on the board but Jillian Jennings responded only a few minutes later thanks to a nice pass from fellow junior Erin Mieth. Jennings outran the Ridger defense and took advantage of an overly aggressive Ege by chipping the ball over her for the tying goal. The tone changed completely, however, when Tomison Kennedy found Lindsay Jaiyesimi with a well-placed through pass that allowed Jaiyesimi to find the back of the net in the 74th minute. \n\"They wanted it more than us,\" McOmish said. \"We're starting to figure out that we can't assume we're going to win. We need to come out and play. We didn't play well and we didn't match their energy.\" \nEmail: verhagen@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:57:11.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
