Additional professor Santosh Kumar said that while searching on the web no such example was found in history of medical science where kidney of such an old patient was not removed while removing the tumour. The PGI will send the case for consideration to officials of the Guiness Book of World Records, he said. Mohinder Pal, son of patient Uttamjit Kaur wrote a letter to the doctors at the PGI expressed his gratitude to them. Dr Santosh said that the patient from Himachal Pradesh was brought to the PGI three months ago with complaints of pain and blood in urine. The diagnostic tests confirmed that she was suffering from cancer of the kidney. The treatment is to remove the cancer either partially or completely depending upon the size. As one grows older, complexity increases. The ability of the person to tolerate that kind of a complex surgery also decreases and the chance of complications after the surgery goes up. In this case, the patient had problem in the knee joints and 20 per cent of her heart was not functioning, said the doctor. The family, however, had full faith in the expertise of the doctors as the younger son of the patient had already undergone one such successful surgery at the hospital. Mohinder Pal said the doctors explained them that during the surgery only the tumour-bearing kidney (partial nephrectomy) would be removed which was more difficult than removal of the whole kidney because partial nephrectomy resulted in more blood loss and was technically challenging. “I couldn’t express my feelings when I spoke to my mother nearly six hours after the surgery. Two days later, she was up and about walking and eating”, said Mohinder Pal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:33:05.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
