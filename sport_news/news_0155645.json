They have great players and one of the premier guys in the nation in Mecole Hardman. We’ve had a good week of practice, and I feel like we’re focused. But we’re going to have to have our best effort without a doubt.” \nThe third-ranked Dragons (5-0, 1-0 Region 8-AAA) and fourth-ranked Blue Devils (5-0. 1-0) expect a war when they face off in a battle of the only undefeated teams left in Region 8-AAA (though Oconee County is undefeated in league play). \n“We’re excited; our community’s excited, and we expect to see a big crowd in the Granite Bowl Friday night,” Fritts said. \nIt’s understandable with the quality on display from both sides. ( Click here for a look at all of Friday night's contests for area teams .) \nThe explosive Hardman is -- according to some recruiting services -- the No. 1 athlete in the state, and his play at quarterback is undoubtedly a difference-maker for the Blue Devils. \n“Mecole’s a tremendous player -- people ask if he’s the best I’ve ever coached; he may be the best I’ve ever seen,” said Fritts of the senior, who has rushed for 797 yards (8.1 yards per carry) and 13 touchdowns, as well as passed for 308 yards and three scores, along with four interceptions. \nAnd while Jefferson missed out on facing the signal caller last season -- Hardman was injured and did not play in a 52-6 Dragons win -- the visitors know they must not allow the senior to take over this year's contest. \n“You have to contain him the best you can. You’re not going to stop him. He’s going to get his, and you just have to limit the opportunity for explosive plays he has,” Hall said of Hardman. \nFritts spoke in similar terms of Jefferson running back Colby Wood. \nThe sophomore has made the most of running behind a veteran and talented offensive line but has an extra gear and field vision that has helped him to rush for 961 yards (192.2 yards per game) and 14 touchdowns.“ \n\"We’ve got to try to get the Wood kid hit before he gets started,” Fritts said. “You let a running back get into the second/third level, with his skill set, then you’re going to be in trouble.” \nGetting to Wood has proven a tall task indeed, as opponents struggle to cut a swathe through the Dragons’ men in the trenches. Similarly, the Dragons’ defensive line has also mauled opponents this season -- both units wearing down and/or overpowering foes as evidenced by the fact that Jefferson is allowing just 86 yards rushing per game while rushing for 258 itself. \nAnd while Elbert County has already battled one sizable offensive line in Stephens County (a 34-30 win against a team anchored by Georgia-bound lineman Ben Cleveland), Fritts says Jefferson’s front is the biggest test yet. \n“We’ve had such a difficult schedule. Everybody we play has at some point been in the top 10. But this one presents a whole new set of problems because they’re so good up front, both offensive line and defensive line,” Fritts said. “(Against Stephens County) we didn’t stop them very much; we just outscored them. And I don’t know if we can do that very much, as good as they (Jefferson) are defensively. They’re going to control the line of scrimmage, so we’ve got to be able to hang in there and take some shots.” \nJefferson certainly expects a few shots from the Blue Devils -- who are, despite Hardman’s eye-popping stats, far from a one-man show. \n“(Running back) Tra Barnett’s an exceptional football player. He was the MVP of the Hart County game,” Fritts said. “La’kel Hood, our B back is a guy that takes a lot of pressure off. And Mecole’s gotten to where he can throw the ball efficiently over the summer, and we’ve got some guys that can go get it -- Joseph Johnson, Montavious Tinch, Turner Banks... There’s a number of guys that can help him.” \nJefferson, meanwhile, is also looking out for more hands to help on offense. \n“We’re going to have to be more balanced than we have been in recent weeks and take some pressure off the line of scrimmage,” Hall said. “We’ve done a consistent job up front, but we have to take pressure off them with the passing game, play-action and so forth. They have been able to handle the load, but as we get into the region season and tougher games down the road we have to be more balanced, and the kids realize that.” \nJefferson quarterback Bryce Moore enters the contest with 460 yards passing and two touchdowns, compared with three interceptions. \n“We’re to a point where our skill guys have developed, and we can ask them to do more each game, and that’s been nice,” Hall said. “And it says a lot about the guys up front that allowed us to put the stress on them. And we have stressed those linemen and the backfield, and now those receivers and quarterback are coming along nicely.” \nPerhaps there’s no better way to see just how much they have developed than in a top five showdown in an atmosphere that will match what teams will likely see come postseason. \n“We’re expecting a playoff atmosphere,” Hall said. “It’s going to be an intense game; it’s going to be a hardfought ballgame, and the team that limits turnovers and explosive plays is going to come out on top.” \nAnd the program that does that on Friday might well be in prime position for the postseason because of it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:04:40.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
