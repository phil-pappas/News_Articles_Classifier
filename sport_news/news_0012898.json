In a battle of two teams tied for third place in league standings, the Thundering Herd came away the victor, improving to 12-3-3, 5-2-2 in Conference USA. Marshall’s 12 season wins and five C-USA wins tie program records. It was the Herd’s first win (1-2-0) against the Lady Toppers, as well as its first trip to Bowling Green. WKU fell to 8-5-4, 4-3-2. Both goals were scored in the final 10 minutes of play, within four minutes of each other. Freshman forward Ashley Seltzer (Knoxville, Tenn.) broke the ice in the 81st minute with her third goal of the season, unassisted, collecting a rebound off a shot by Mack Moore (West Chester, Pa.) and finishing from 10 yards away. Just three minutes and 18 seconds later, junior forward Sydney Arnold (Stafford, Va.) doubled the Herd’s lead with her team-leading seventh score of the year, assisted by Seltzer. Seltzer’s three points are her career high for a single match. Despite being out-shot, 15-10, the Marshall defense fended off the Lady Toppers’ attack for its eighth shutout of the season. It was the second consecutive clean match for the Herd, moving to 180 minutes without a goal allowed. Senior goalkeeper Lizzie Kish (Boyertown, Pa.) picked up her 20th career blank sheet, firming her grip on the program record. She made three saves in the victory. START ME UP Senior defender Jenna Dubs (Green Lane, Pa.) tied the all-time Marshall record of 76 consecutive starts, held by Sarah Vinson (2009-12). She has started every match of her career, totaling 7,128 minutes on the pitch. SOUNDS LIKE A BROKEN RECORD Senior midfielder Kelly Culicerto (Charlotte, N.C.) claimed her third school record with her 82nd shot of the season, topping the previous mark of 80 held by Amanda McMahon. Culicerto owns records in career shots (223) and game-winning goals (nine). LONG STORY SHORT Quotes by Coach Kevin Long: On the value of the win: “That was a big win for us. WKU played a style that challenged us. It was great to walk away with the win on the road against a good WKU team. This late in the season, every point matters; in the standings and where you’re seeded if you make it to the tournament. That was a valuable three points for us, and we’re thankful for them moving closer to the end of the regular season.” #BEHERD Stay up-to-date on all things Herd women’s soccer via social media: Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , YouTube and Snapchat (username: HerdZone).
