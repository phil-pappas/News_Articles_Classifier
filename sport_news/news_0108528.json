The Admirals are talented on both lines of scrimmage, but their knack for rushing the passer, particularly with ends Cole Strange and Ben Hoffman, will be the difference on Friday. The Rebels scrambled to add depth in their backfield after sophomore running back Devante Patrick tore the ACL in his right knee against Powell in Week 5 and still are looking for complementary big-play threats alongside wide receiver Jermaine “Boom” Buchannon. Farragut is averaging 38.3 points per game this season.\nPrepXtra Pick: Farragut 31, West 24\nGreenback (4-2, 2-0 Region 2-1A) at Coalfield (6-1, 2-1): Ninth-ranked Greenback has beaten No. 8 Coalfield in the past two regular seasons, only to fall to the Yellow Jackets in the playoffs. The Cherokees boast a pair of capable running backs in Kayne Roberts and Devin Devine, and quarterback Hunter Willis is a viable option in the passing game. Coalfield, which has surrendered more than 20 points twice this season, should match up well defensively. Jordan Ervin has led the Yellow Jackets to two wins after stepping in at quarterback for Parker McKinney (collarbone), but last week’s slow start played a role in a 21-16 loss to Harriman. Keep an eye on Greenback defensive lineman Josh Silvey, the reigning KIL Sophomore of the Year who transferred from Catholic during the offseason.\nPrepXtra Pick: Greenback 21, Coalfield 16\nBattle Ground Academy (5-1) at Webb (3-3), 7 p.m., 10News2: This is a rematch of last season’s Division II-A state championship game, which Webb won 38-21. Both teams are coming off tough losses. The Spartans’ run-game fizzled in a 20-14 loss to Donelson Christian Academy last week, and BGA was limited to a season-low seven points against Davidson Academy. Webb will have to fix inconsistencies in the ground game in a hurry to nix the impact of BGA quarterback Clay Beathard, the brother of Iowa starting QB C.J. Beathard.\nPrepXtra Pick: BGA 25, Webb 16\nHardin Valley (3-3, 1-2 Region 1-6A) at Jefferson County (3-3, 1-2): The tough losses have been aplenty for Hardin Valley in Region 1-6A this season. The Hawks suffered a gut-wrenching, two-point defeat to Dobyns-Bennett, and couldn’t muster enough red-zone offense to avoid a 20-7 loss to Science Hill. Still, HVA is in position to host a first-round playoff game if it can secure wins against Jefferson County, Bradley Central and William Blount during the next three weeks. The Hawks have relied on a steady running game, led by Issiah Aguero and Tim Frizzell, to complement one of the better defenses in the area. Jefferson County has the personnel to test the latter. Patriots quarterback Austin Jenkins accounted for five touchdowns last week against William Blount, throwing four TD passes.\nPrepXtra Pick: Hardin Valley 24, Jefferson County 14\nElizabethton over Claiborne\nGatlinburg-Pittman over Cosby\nSouth Greene over Cumberland Gap\nMorristown East over Daniel Boone\nNorthview Academy over Chuckey-Doak\nScience Hill over William Blount\nSevier County over David Crockett\nGrainger over Sullivan Central\nGreeneville over Sullivan South\nTennessee over Cocke County\nPigeon Forge over Unicoi County\nGrace Christian over Wartburg\nOneida over Jellico\nCentral over Halls\nLoudon over Howard Tech\nHarriman over Midway\nRockwood over Oliver Springs\nSeymour over Scott\nOakdale over Sunbright\nSweetwater over Tellico Plains\nUnion County over Austin-East\nBell County (Ky.) over Campbell County\nKingston over York Institute\nThe King’s Academy over Concord Christian\nBattle Ground Academy over Webb\nNick Carboni’s picks\nElizabethton over Claiborne\nGatlinburg-Pittman over Cosby\nSouth Greene over Cumberland Gap\nJefferson County over Hardin Valley\nMorristown East over Daniel Boone\nChuckey-Doak over Northview Academy\nScience Hill over William Blount\nSevier County over David Crockett\nGrainger over Sullivan Central\nGreeneville over Sullivan South\nTennessee over Cocke County\nPigeon Forge over Unicoi County\nGreenback over Coalfield\nGrace Christian over Wartburg\nOneida over Jellico\nCentral over Halls\nLoudon over Howard\nHarriman over Midway\nRockwood over Oliver Springs\nSeymour over Scott\nOakdale over Sunbright\nTellico Plains over Sweetwater\nAustin-East over Union County\nCampbell County over Bell County (Ky.)\nFarragut over West\nKingston over York Institute\nThe King’s Academy over Concord Christian\nWebb over BGA", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zsJHL-1cUT58.khz6AJLh3dmc&z=16"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:09:02.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
