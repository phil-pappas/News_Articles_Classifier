Related Links Roundup: Morris soccer reaches regional title game \nMorris’ first goal came 23 minutes into the game after a foul outside the goalie box. On a direct kick, Matt Samolis hit the top cross bar, and the ball bounced down into the net. The second goal came 10 minutes later from Conner Shaw, who dribbled through two defenders to shoot from 20 yards out. \nIn the second half, Streator scored with minutes remaining to make it 2-1 before tying the score at 2 with a goal at the 8:00 mark. \nHowever, two key Morris subs – Josh Lain and Alex Randall – changed the last 1:39, when Randall gave a perfect switch to Lain, who dribbled, cut back and put the ball in the back of the net. \nMorris now tries for its fifth straight regional championship at 3 p.m. Saturday against Geneseo, which defeated LaSalle-Peru, 6-0, in the other semifinal. \n“We did a really great job in the first half of dominating the possession game,” Morris coach David Valdivia said. “We won the balls in the air, as well as getting a lot of scoring opportunities and corner kicks. The second half was another story, as we played Streator’s game and lost momentum. \n“We had a tough season with injuries, to the point that Matt Borgstrom, our senior goalie, is playing center back and our sophomore keeper is playing. We had eight sophomores, one junior and two seniors start against Streator.” \nFOOTBALL \nSycamore sophomores 6, Morris 0: Morris (4-4) had two defensive stops inside the 10-yard line on Oct. 16. Kam Dransfeldt had a fumble recovery on the 2-yard line, while Blake Breyman came up with an interception for the Redskins, who finish their season Friday night at LaSalle-Peru. \nGIRLS SWIMMING \nIMSA 151, Morris 64: Morris was led by Jen Ashley, who took second place in the 200-meter individual medley (2:37.16) and third in the 100 butterfly (1:11.32). Morris got a second-place finish from Meghan Carr in diving (154.65) and from Reilly Chytracek in the 500 freestyle (6:17.91). \nVOLLEYBALL \nGardner-South Wilmington 25-25, Illinois Lutheran 16-15: The Panthers (16-5, 8-3) got six kills from Marlana Ferrari in the River Valley Conference win, while Lexi Robison added four kills and two blocks.
