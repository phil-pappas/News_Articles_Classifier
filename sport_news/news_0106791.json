Bryant totaled 87 yards its first two possessions and led 7-0 early, but Greenwood played fast in an effort to wear down the Hornets. In the second and third quarter, Bryant totaled less than 100 yards. Bryant still likely gets a first-round bye and likely plays host in the second round of the playoffs to the loser of Week 10’s Bentonville at Fayetteville matchup. Van Buren has lost its past three games by a total of 10 points, including the past two weeks by a total of three points. The Pointers lost last Friday in overtime at Russellville 32-21. The Pointers tied the game in the fourth quarter on Jordan Barlow’s 81-yard pass to Zach Wornkey. \nConway at LITTLE ROCK CATHOLIC (3): Conway has dropped back-to-back games to Class 6A schools, trailing 28-10 at halftime last Friday in Alma. Alma turnovers and Marquise Pleasant’s 100-yard kick return spurred a second-half rally. The return of standout senior QB Andre Sale has helped Catholic win over Class 6A schools the past two Fridays. \n7A WEST \nSPRINGDALE HAR-BER (7) at Fort Smith Southside: After back-to-back emotional wins over Bentonville and Fayetteville, Har-Ber must regain focus quickly. Har-Ber QB Fuller Chandler’s short pass to Trey Smith with six seconds left beat Fayetteville 47-43 last Friday, but Wildcat workhorse Luke Hannon was the MVP with five TDs and 318 yards rushing. Southside two-time all-conference safety Jace McCrea (6-2, 185; 4.5 speed) leads an improving Rebel defense. The Rebels shut out Rogers Heritage 20-0 last week. \nBENTONVILLE (9) at Rogers High: Rogers led at Fort Smith Northside 9-6 late in the first half last Friday but gave up 24 unanswered points. Bentonville has ripped Rogers in the old “Battle of Highway 71” the past five years by a average score of 46-4. \nFORT SMITH NORTHSIDE (4) at Springdale High: Springdale scared defending state champion Bentonville last Friday. The Red Dogs had a TD pass called back by holding, and Bentonville scored a late TD to win 28-3 win. Springdale senior QB Jack Lindsey passed eight times to Kyler Williams for 111 yards in the first half. Northside’s defense shut out Rogers in the second half, and Grizzly QB Max Frazier ran for two TDs and passed for another for a 30-9 homecoming victory. The winner of Week 10’s Northside vs. Southside rivalry likely earns a No. 4 playoff seed and home game in the first round. \nRogers Heritage at FAYETTEVILLE (50): Fayetteville rebounds from last week’s last-second loss at Har-Ber to score Coach Daryl Patton’s 111th win at the school. Heritage ranks at or near the bottom in most 7A-West statistical categories. \nClass 6A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:16:17.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
