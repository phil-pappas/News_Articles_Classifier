Alonso confirms he’ll stay at McLaren \nFernando Alonso has made light of his frustrations with the struggling McLaren Honda team and confirmed he plans to stay with the team next year and through 2017. \nHe said on Thursday that his widely broadcast radio messages, in which he criticised the performance of his car’s Honda engine during the Japanese Grand Prix, were insignificant and had not upset Honda. \nAfter two weeks of intense speculation about his future, the two-time world champion Spaniard said his plans were clear and he was not thinking of retiring before the end of his contract which runs until 2017. \nAsked if he would still be racing for McLaren next year, he said: “Yes, of course … and 2017, yes.” \nTeam-mate Briton Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, has agreed to stay with the team next year. \nAlonso said also that his radio comments in Japan had not caused any problems within the team. \nIn that race, he said the performance of his Honda engine was “embarrassing” and he also compared it to the units used by cars racing in junior category GP2. \nHe explained that his comments came from pure frustration in the heat of the race. \n“Obviously we have been all season very positive about the team and the car,” he said. \n“We face some difficult times, some tough times as a team, and what you talk on the radio should remain private because you are talking to the team. \n“When you are in a car, and in a race, and you try to give it all and you are fighting lap after lap and you keep losing positions easily on the straight, even before the braking-point, you get some frustration out there on the radio.” Stay up to date with the latest sports news Follow our social accounts to get exclusive content and all the latest sporting news!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:19:28.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
