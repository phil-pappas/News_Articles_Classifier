Fast improving Grandmaster Vidit Santosh Gujrathi stole the honours of the opening day of the three-day event after coming out with an inspired performance including a victory over second seed Alexander Grischuk of Russia. Apart from Grischuk, Gujrathi also accounted for higher rated Grandmasters like Gadir Guseinov of Azerbaijan and Andrei Volokitin of Ukraine besides getting two hard-fought draws against Russian Ian Nepomniachtchi and Hungarian Peter Leko. He ended the day in tied second spot with four points from five games played thus far. For Anand, the day started with a victory over Russian Grandmaster Kateryna Lagno and Alexander Onischuk of the United States. â€” PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:12:42.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
