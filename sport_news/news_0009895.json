Ask the experts! \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. — Ezekiel Elliott went over 1,000 yards rushing for the second straight season on Saturday night, the Ohio State junior flipping a slow start with a 55-yard touchdown that capped a big game in a 49-7 win over Rutgers.\nAlong the way, Elliott extended his streak of 100-yard rushing games to 13 straight, best in the Football Bowl Subdivision, as he finished with 142 yards and two touchdowns.\nNeeding just 12 yards to top 1,000, he was limited to 15 in the first half.\n“I’m not going to lie, I really was worried,” Elliott said of the possibility of being held short of 100. “The way they play their defensive front it makes it really hard to get our double-team (blocks). Going into the second half, we made an adjustment, we decided to run a lot more power, a lot more gap scheme. It made it easier for us to get to those double teams.”\nElliott left the game after his 55-yard TD run that went up the middle and gave the Buckeyes a 49-0 with 13:42 to play. The slow start was due to Rutgers stuffing the line of scrimmage, daring quarterback J.T. Barrett and the Buckeyes to throw, coach Urban Meyer said.\nElliott gave Meyer his third straight season with a running back topping 1,000 yards, something that had eluded Meyer in his first 11 years as a coach at four schools before Carlos Hyde started the streak at Ohio State in 2013.\nElliott turned in the second-best rushing season at Ohio State last year when a 696 postseason yards in a three-game run to the national championship pushed him to 1,878. Only Eddie George’s 1,927 yards in his 1995 Heisman Trophy season was better.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nGoing into the game, Elliott had 988 yards through the first seven outings. He was fourth in the nation in average yards at 141.1, behind LSU’s Leonard Fournette (200.3), Florida State’s Dalvin Cook (159.2) and Oregon’s Royce Freeman (142.4).\nRutgers receiver in, then out Rutgers was banged up after its comeback win at Indiana last week, the most worrisome being the status of receiver Leonte Carroo, who came into the game leading the team in catches (21) and yards (472) and first in the Big Ten with nine touchdown receptions.\nCarroo was listed as questionable all week because of an ankle injury, but he seemed to be moving freely during pregame warmups.\nHe caught an 18-yard pass on Rutgers’ second play from scrimmage and finished the first half with three catches for 55 yards.\nBut he did not return for the second half. When asked, coach Kyle Flood only said that Carroo was physically unable to continue.\nMissed opportunity Flood promised that his team would “get back to work” after a performance that clearly left him disappointed.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards \n“We didn’t perform very well as a program tonight, and that begins with me,” Flood said. “We’ve got to turn the page. We’ve got another game coming in less than seven days. We’ve got to learn from this, see what applies next week and then put our eyes forward.”\nFlood was unhappy that Rutgers converted only 1 of 8 third-down opportunities in the first half, saying, “We couldn’t keep drives going.”\nHe also rued that the Scarlet Knights’ promising first possession ended with a missed 29-yard field-goal attempt by Kyle Federico but disagreed that the missed kick took the air out of his team’s sails.\nAlmost a shutout The Buckeyes came within a few seconds of tossing a shutout defensively. It would have been their second the season.\n“It’s upsetting, because the ones were in there playing pretty good … it’s always upsetting giving up points, and you could feel the defense was a little upset,” defensive end Joey Bosa said. “But overall, we played a really good game I thought.”\nPenalty-free zone Ohio State entered the game averaging 66.7 yards on penalties, having committed 51 in its first seven games, many of them costly.\nAgainst Rutgers, they did not commit any penalties.\n“That might be the most impressive thing (in the victory),” Meyer said. “That’s how locked in they were. That’s a lot of discipline — to have zero penalties on the road.”\nNo Gibson Ohio State freshman receiver Torrance Gibson was not among the 70 players on the travel roster for the Rutgers game. The converted quarterback, who was a coveted recruit, did not dress for last week’s home game against Penn State.\nMeyer indicated that academics were part of the reason Gibson wasn’t permitted to suit up last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:17:58.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
