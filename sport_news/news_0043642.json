The result of Sundays four-hour race will decide the winners of the 2015 LM P2 championship and three Nissan-powered teams are in with a shot at the title. JOTA Sport lead the way but Greaves Motorsport are just one-point behind and Thiriet by TDS Racing currently sit third with a 10-point deficit to the top of the table. These three Nissan-powered teams have won every race between them this year so Estoril is going to be a close fight to the finish. The line-up in the #38 Gibson-Nissan of JOTA Sport features Nissan LM P1 racer, Harry Tincknell who is ready to fight hard for the title that eluded the Le Mans-winning team last year. \"We head to Estoril leading the championship and of course the aim is still to be leading it when the chequered flag drops!\" said Tincknell. \"Its been a great season for JOTA Sport, weve been on the podium in every race weve contested so far this season and as a team weve grown even stronger than last year. We only have a slender lead however, so our focus has to be the same, to go out and win the race. If we do that, then the championship is in our own hands. Estoril is a track that should really suit the Gibson chassis and the Nissan NISMO engine has been the class of the LMP2 field all season.\" The LM P2 title may still be up for grabs but the 2015 European Le Mans Series LM P3 title was decided last time out at Paul Ricard in France. Nissans Sir Chris Hoy and his Ginetta team-mate Charlie Robertson took the crown with their third victory of the season. The Scottish duo arent going to Estoril for a relaxed Sunday drive though, they are racing to win. \"It was a great feeling to win the LM P3 title at Paul Ricard,\" said Hoy. \"The season so far in the Ginetta-Nissan has helped me to take another step along my road to Le Mans. There is no championship at stake this weekend but we always compete to win. Every lap is experience that will stand me in good stead for my debut at Le Mans next year.\" An LM P3 victory has eluded 2014 Nissan GT Academy winner Gaetan Paletou this season. The Frenchman took a podium finish at Silverstone and at the Red Bull Ring but he wants to win. A technical issue took him out of the lead at Paul Ricard so he is fully focused on making it to the top step of the podium on Sunday in the #2 Ginetta-Nissan. The 4 Hours of Estoril gets underway this Sunday at 13:00 local time. Qualifying takes place on Sunday morning at 09:30 following Saturdays two free practice sessions.
