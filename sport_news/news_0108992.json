How that happened, considering how long each were in the same conference and good, is one of the game’s great mysteries. \nSo, we take one we can get. \nWhat we got Saturday, was both fun and ultimately frustrating. \nArmed with Radim Vrbata on their line, the Sedins were heat-seeking missiles, crawling and poking in and around the Detroit crease like ants building a sand mountain there. \nIf they had any luck at all and, to be honest, better wrist shots, they would have had 12 goals. \nThey had none. The same number of wins at Rogers Arena the Canucks have this season in five games. \nIf this was a few years ago, the Sedins probably would have had three goals, and the Canucks would have had a win. \nInstead, the Sedins couldn’t offensively help a team that desperately needed goals and a win, and Vancouver flat out blew another one. \nThe Canucks don’t defend well. It’s a pattern which has stretched out for most of the month. \nPart of it is because they have two lines you really can’t count on. \nMore so than with any Canucks team in recent memory, no lead is safe. It’s why the Sedins needed to connect on one of those spectacular chances. \nWith the Sedins unable to score in regulation, Vancouver built a 2-0 lead on the backs of its second power-play unit. \nBut that lead was obliterated in a three-minute stretch early in the third period. \nIt meant overtime, and wouldn’t you know, Daniel Sedin, who had a wonderful but snake-bitten game, took a tripping penalty. \nThe Canucks survived that. They didn’t not survive the overtime, losing 3-2. \nWHAT THIS MEANS \nThe Canucks so-called youth movement is having some growing pains. \nAfter benching three young players Thursday, head coach Willie Desjardins met with his group of rookies. \nAfter, they were all back in the lineup Saturday. The results were mixed. Jared McCann played pretty great for two periods. Meanwhile, Jake Virtanen and Sven Baertschi barely played. \nNeither Virtanen nor Baertschi got to two minutes of ice time in the second period with the Canucks up by two goals. \nThis wasn’t a team trying to hold on late to a third-period lead. It certainly raises some questions about how the Canucks plan to develop these guys. \nIf Baertschi and Virtanen aren’t going to play in a 2-0 game, it’s fair to wonder how long they can last with the big club. \nThis week, Desjardins warned that if they want to stay in the lineup and get regular shifts, they better not be making passive, defensive mistakes. \nBut Saturday, two of them didn’t get to make any mistakes at all. \nMcCann, however, had his best game a Canuck. He was fast, smart and elusive, at one point carving his way through four Red Wings to create a scoring chance. \nWHAT WE LEARNED \nChris Tanev is different. \nMaybe it’s the skating. Maybe it’s the shot. Maybe it’s the way he’s attacking in the offensive zone. Tanev, always an elite defender, looks like he has taken a step offensively. \nYes, Tanev scored. If this were 1978, the initial reaction would be to stop the presses. \nBut even after his goal he looked dangerous. He nearly picked a corner in the the third, launching a really good wrist shot of Petr Mrazek’s goalie mask. \nTanev has put in time improving his skating, getting stronger and trying to add to his offensive game. That last part shouldn’t be hard, because up to now there hasn’t been one. \nIN A WORD \nCONCERNED: That’s how Wings centre Luke Glendening looked in the first period with Jake Virtanen thundering after him on the forecheck. Glendening didn’t lift the puck up and handed it to Virtanen to avoid a hit. It just looked that way. \nBACKSWING: As in there was none when Jared McCann unleashed a shot from 37 feet out in the second period. It didn’t beat the Wings goalie, but it was a laser, a pea, and endlessly impressive. The kid can shoot. \nSHOWDOWN: With the Wings down 2-0 and on the power play, Henrik Zetterberg had the puck all alone to Ryan Miller’s right. He felt like they stared each other down for 10 minutes before Miller made a big save. \nADVANCED STATS \n+13: This was Dan Hamhuis’s five-on-five shot attempt differential. He was on the ice for 19 shot attempts for and just six against. It was the best on the team and Hamhuis’s best game of the season. He was paired for only the second time with Yannick Weber. \n8: This is how many high-quality “danger” scoring chances the Canucks had in regulation. The Detroit Red Wings had just one. The danger chances are shots which are taken in front and to the side of the goalie, within a few feet of the crease. \n18:58: This has been the per-game average ice time for Canucks defenceman Ben Hutton. Among NHL rookies, he has been leading all blueliners and is second only to centre Jack Eichel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:23:25.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
