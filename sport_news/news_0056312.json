Brian Elliott finished with 23 saves. \n\"I thought where we turned the game around a little bit was in the the second half of the second period,\" Blues coach Ken Hitchcock said. \"We started to really check and create turnovers and really got after them a little bit and started to put a bunch of shots up. ... That kind of turned the momentum for us a little bit.\" Edmonton Oilers' Taylor Hall, left, reaches for the puck as St. Louis Blues goalie Brian Elliott defends during the second period of an NHL hockey game Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, in St. Louis.

He had two shots on goal, and struggled on face-offs — winning only three of 13. \n\"I did some good stuff, did some bad stuff,\" McDavid said.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) \nOilers coach Todd McLellan described McDavid's debut as \"fine.\" \n\"At times I thought he was very dangerous and at other times I didn't think that line had a lot going,\" McLellan said. \"So it's a matter of timing and chemistry and trying to find the right combinations for him and his linemates.\" \nFabbri, a 19-year-old forward and the Blues' first-round pick in 2014, was one of three rookies in the St. Louis lineup — joining defensemen Colton Parayko and Joel Edmundson. Fabbri became the youngest player in franchise history to score a goal in his debut, according to information provided by the Blues from the Elias Sports Bureau.

He lost a face-off but when Blues defenseman Alex Pietrangelo tried to clear the puck it bounced off Alexander Steen and past Brian Elliott. Nugent-Hopkins was credited with the unassisted power-play goal with 2:38 remaining in the period.

This one decided to go five-hole.\" \nTarasenko tied it a 9:10 of the second after getting loose on a breakaway with a stretch pass from Pietrangelo and beating Talbot through his legs. \n\"I didn't need to look. I knew it was going in,\" Pietrangelo said. \"He's going to score those. Makes it look awfully easy, that's for sure.\" Edmonton Oilers' Nail Yakupov (10), of Russia, shoots as St. Louis Blues' Paul Stastny, left, defends during the first period of an NHL hockey game Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, in St. Louis. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) \nTarasenko, who signed an eight-year, $60 million extension in the offseason, was the last Blues player to score in his debut. He scored twice against Detroit on Jan. 19, 2013. \nNOTES: Anton Slepyshev also made his NHL debut for the Oilers. ... St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina dropped the ceremonial first puck. ... The attendance was announced as standing room-only 19,327. . The Blues improved to 51-11 in games, both regular season and postseason, in which Tarasenko scores a goal.
