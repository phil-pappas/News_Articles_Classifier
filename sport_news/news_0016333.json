New Orleans was going to ease the pressure on quarterback Drew Brees to make all the plays to win all the games by giving him a running game he could lean on.\nBut three games into the season, the Saints have no giddy-up. New Orleans is win-less and run-less. But if ever that ground game is going to show up for the Saints, it will be this weekend against the Cowboys, who were shredded for 141 yards and three touchdowns last weekend by a backup running back in a home loss to the Atlanta Falcons.\nSaints coach and former Cowboys assistant Sean Payton watched from afar a year ago as the Cowboys turned to DeMarco Murray and once again became an NFC power, winning the East with a 12-4 record. The Cowboys reduced Tony Romo's workload by 100 passes from 2013 and increased Murray's workload by 175 handoffs in 2014.\nSo Payton began his own offensive overhaul by trading away his top two receivers, tight end Jimmy Graham to Seattle and wide receiver Kenny Stills to Miami. They caught 148 of Brees' passes for 1,820 yards and 13 touchdowns last season in the NFL's top-ranked offense.\nThe Saints received Pro Bowl center Max Unger from the Seahawks in the Graham deal to beef up the blocking front. New Orleans further bulked up by using the 13th overall pick of the 2015 draft on Stanford's All-America offensive tackle Andrus Peat. Like the 2014 Cowboys, the Saints were making a sizable investment in their offensive line.\nNew Orleans re-signed leading rusher Mark Ingram to a four-year, $16 million deal to provide muscle to the inside running game. The Saints also signed C.J. Spiller away from the Buffalo Bills in free agency to a four-year, $18 million contract to provide a speed element to the ground game.\nThe plan was to run the ball in 2015 -- and the Saints are. They rank seventh in the NFL in rushing attempts this season with 90. But there has been little return on that investment thus far. New Orleans ranks only 26th in yardage with an average of only 76 per game. That's forced the Saints to fall back on their passing ways without the desired results.\nBrees threw 48 passes in a season-opening loss to Arizona, then threw 38 more the second weekend in a home loss to Tampa Bay. He was sacked four times by the Buccaneers and suffered a bruised shoulder that knocked him out of last weekend's game against Carolina. Luke McCown stepped in and threw 38 times in that 27-22 loss to the Panthers. When the football is in the air, the Saints miss Graham and Stills.\nWhen the focus has been on the ground, the Saints have struggled. They gained only 54 yards on 20 carries against Arizona, 104 yards on 27 carries against Tampa Bay and 70 yards on 24 carries against Carolina. That certainly isn't what Payton envisioned from his new-look offense.\nBrees remains a longshot to play against the Cowboys. But after watching the tape of Devonta Freeman gash the Cowboys for runs of 17, 16, 16 and 10 yards in his 30-carry performance last weekend, the Saints might be wise to recommit to the running game on Sunday night.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges.\nMore Cowboys coverage Reviewing Weeden\nNate Newton: Cowboys have got to let Brandon Weeden be a 'starting quarterback'\nCompared to Romo, Weeden falls well short of starting QB on deep throws\nUpon further review: Brad Sham joins crew to discuss Weeden/Cassel, what happened to Dallas' D and look ahead to the Saints\nSabin: Results show Cowboys coach Jason Garrett's stance on having veteran backup QB is flawed\nCURIOUS GEORGE: Should Cowboys change QBs?
