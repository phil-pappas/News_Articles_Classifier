In English, it simply asks audiences to turn off their phones.\nIn Asia, mobile messenger apps are so popular that they not only have taken over phone calls and text messages but are also widely used for other daily tasks such as taxi hailing and sending money. Many Korean smartphone users belong to multiple chat groups in Kakao Talk and are constantly exchanging messages with colleagues, friends and families.\nThe 10-day film festival runs until Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:34:14.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
