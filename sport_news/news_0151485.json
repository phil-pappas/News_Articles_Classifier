And the top-15 contest will be televised by ABC in front of a sold-out Clemson Memorial Stadium. \nBut none of that is likely to shake the focus of Clemson sophomore quarterback Deshaun Watson Deshaun Watson #4 6-2, 207Gainesville, GA View Full Profile . With everything that is going on surrounding the game, Watson has remained his usual calm self. \n“Just prepare the same and have fun with the preparation and the process,” Watson said of his focus. “Not many people get to experience what we’re going to experience this week. Just have fun and do what we love to do and perform. I have to be level-headed and make sure everyone is being calm and not getting too excited, and if adversity comes around, not get too far down on themselves. \n“I just try to get everyone pumped up but at the same time, stay on the same level so we can focus and perform to our best.” \nWatson likes the way he has performed so far this season. \nHe played one half each against Wofford and Appalachian State and then led the Tigers to a win at Louisville in just his second career road start (the other came last year at Georgia Tech in a game in which he got hurt). \nWatson has completed 58-of-78 passes for 641 yards. He has thrown seven touchdowns and three interceptions (more than the two he threw as a freshman). \n“I’ve played pretty good, especially with the meetings I have had with (quarterbacks coach Brandon) Streeter and (head coach Dabo) Swinney,” Watson said. “They think I have been playing lights out. The first two games I only played a half, and the first road test at Louisville, I thought I played pretty good. That was my best grade so far, even between the first two games, it was like a 96 or 98 percentage. I think I’ve been playing pretty good and just getting better so far.” \nWatson had two of his interceptions in the game against Louisville, one on a throw to tight end Jordan Leggett Jordan Leggett", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:20:08.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
