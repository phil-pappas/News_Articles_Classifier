(Photo: File photo) \nAfter a one-week break, it's back to recognizing the Big Ten West as the source of most Midwestern happiness these days. Also, the home of our new cellar dweller. \n(Weekly disclaimer: This is not a power ranking. This is how the Big Ten teams and their fans are feeling at the moment). \n1. Iowa: How good are things in Iowa City? The Hawkeyes didn't score in the second half Saturday but still emerged from fullback heaven – Iowa vs. Wisconsin – as the favorite to win the Big Ten West. Well, unless Northwestern is the favorite. The Wildcats do host the Hawkeyes next week. But the Wildcats also travel to Ann Arbor this week and still have a trip to Wisconsin ahead. Kirk Ferentz has a great chance to get to Indy and he has his first win over Wisconsin since 2009 (the last time he had a special team). And he didn't need any C.J. Beathard magic this time to make it happen. Now Beathard needs to rediscover his touch, and it should help to get away from a really good Wisconsin defense. \n2. Northwestern: Finally, Chicago belongs to the 'Cats. The White Sox fans, anyway. The bandwagon jumpers are feverishly trying to figure out if it's \"ARE-ietta\" or \"AIR-ietta.\" Northwestern just thumped Minnesota in a contender/pretender revelation, a shutout to set up Saturday's game of the week at Michigan. True, Cubs-Cardinals Game 2 starts at 5:37 p.m. on that day. But these baseball playoff games don't really get interesting until the fourth quarter anyway – right, Fake Cubs Fans? \n3. Michigan: The khaki kingdom is in order, the U-M defense playing out of its mind. True, the offense took longer than an offense should against Maryland's defense to get going, and the loss of Mario Ojemudia to a season-ending injury is significant. But things still look promising overall. And more and more national writers are starting to talk about U-M as a contender in the East, a team that might just beat both Michigan State and Ohio State. There's no unwinnable hypothetical argument for a Michigan fan right now. \n4. Illinois: Few teams ever receive gifts like the one Nebraska presented to the Fighting Illini in on Saturday in Champaign, Ill. So you forget the two missed field goals, the 50% Nebraska crowd and the fact that the rest of the schedule is brutal. You enjoy the win and try to find two more on the schedule (at Penn State? At Purdue?) \n5. Indiana: \"There are no moral victories in this locker room!\" There's something no one has ever said in an Indiana football locker room. You're darn right Saturday's 34-27 home loss to Ohio State was a moral victory! Possibly top-10 all-time. \n6. Ohio State: Things still aren't exactly rolling for the Buckeyes. But the voters have given up on caring whether Ohio State actually looks like a No. 1 team. And Bret, have you seen the schedule from here? That game at Indiana is truly the toughest Big Ten test for Ohio State until MSU visits. It's one long \"Hang on Sloopy\" rendition for the next six weeks (by the way, nice win at Tennessee, Bret). \n7. Michigan State: Old fans are mad at young fans. Young fans are mad at meteorologists. Meteorologists are mad at sportswriters for pointing out how poorly they did their job Saturday. The Spartans are mad at sportswriters for asking them why everything stinks when everything is, in fact, lovely. And the fans are mad at the Spartans for not beating everyone 50-0, thus making it impossible for the fans to win their hypothetical arguments with Michigan fans. \n8. Purdue: If only Purdue could play Michigan State every week, it would dominate rival Indiana in terms of moral victories. \n9. Penn State: If you watched James Franklin's mini-meltdown after Saturday's sluggish 20-14 win over Army, and you watched the original \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" from 1983 starring Chevy Chase, you may have had a flashback. Is it just me (probably), or when Franklin responded to a question about barely beating Army, did you think of Clark W. Griswold in the car after dropping off Aunt Edna's corpse? \nFranklin : \"I'm gonna come in here every single week and be positive! Even if it kills you guys and you want me to be negative. I love our players, I love our school, love our colors, love Penn State, love Happy Valley, love the community….\" \nGriswold : \"This is no longer a vacation. It's a quest. It's a quest for fun. I'm gonna have fun, and you're gonna have fun. We're gonna have so much (expletive) fun, we'll need plastic surgery to remove our (expletive) smiles!\" \nThe question, then, is who plays Cousin Eddie? I don't have an immediate answer for that and I've already used up my weekly Bret Bielema joke. \n10. Rutgers : You know, things are better than horrifyingly, disgustingly, unfathomably grim at Rutgers these days. The suspended coach has lifted the suspension of the star player (the coach is only suspended for games, smark aleck), whose charges were dropped. This place is an upset of Michigan State away from somewhat depressed and slightly nauseous but able to get out of bed in the morning again. \n11. Wisconsin : Everyone seems to forget that Wisconsin has been a consistent winner for more than 20 years now, with plenty of championships and Rose Bowls to show for it. So when the Big Ten West slips from the Badgers' grasp after one week … well, maybe Bo Ryan won't retire after all. \n12. Minnesota : Jerry Kill has done so much to change the story in Minneapolis, but it has changed on him quickly this season. He has a quarterback controversy and the Big Ten's least-productive rushing offense on his hands, too much for a strong defense to overcome. Gophers of 2015, meet the Spartans of 2012. \n13. Maryland : At this rate, the Terps may win the unofficial championship for largest disparity between quality of men's basketball team and football team. Even Duke and Kentucky and North Carolina can play a little football these days. Oh wait, Kansas. \n14. Nebraska : I can't blame Mike Riley for letting everyone know that Tommy Armstrong Jr. was not supposed to actually throw the ball on the bootleg at Illinois on third-and-7 with the seconds winding down and Illinois out of timeouts. Both of them have handled it well this week and accepted blame. But the question won't go away: Why in the world was that play called in the first place? Call anything else! Armstrong simply reacted with a defender right in his face, as many players would. You kneel there and punt, and the best-case scenario for Illinois is a Hail Mary. And the odds of a completion for a touchdown on a Hail Mary are so low that … yeah, that kind of year in Lincoln.
