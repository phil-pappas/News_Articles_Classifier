After scoring only one goal as a rookie, Kaspick has three this season. \nThe word \"confidence\" comes up a lot when Tanner Kaspick talks about his play so far this Western Hockey League season. \nThe 17-year-old Brandon Wheat Kings forward, who is coming off a gold medal with Canada’s under-18 team at the prestigious Ivan Hlinka Memorial Cup this summer, has three goals in seven games this WHL season. \nAs a rookie last season, Kaspick had one goal and 17 assists in 53 regular-season games. \nHe also scored the overtime winner in Game 4 of the playoffs against the Regina Pats last April, a five-game series in which he notched all three of his post-season points. \n\"Coming into this year I really expected an expanded role for myself and I knew that I would have to play a more confident game to be able to do that,\" Kaspick said. \"That’s been one of my main focuses, just trying to stay confident. It’s a mental game as much as anything. I worked on that a lot this summer as well and I think it’s been helping me out a lot this year.\" \nThe six-foot-one, 202-pound Brandonite scored twice against the Kootenay Ice in his team’s 13-1 victory on Friday and added another goal on Saturday in the Wheat Kings’ 4-3 shootout loss to the Edmonton Oil Kings. \nHe said he thought he was playing well prior to scoring. \n\"No matter what you have to bring your ‘A’ game and do whatever it takes help the team win,\" Kaspick said. \"That’s what I was trying to do when I wasn’t scoring. I knew if I kept shooting and kept working hard that I’d get rewarded and fortunately I did.\" \nIn his second season in the league, Kaspick has also taken on a role helping to kill penalties, a nod to the young player’s work ethic. \n\"The penalty kill is helping our team and it’s something that I take a lot of pride in,\" Kaspick said. \"Whenever I get my name called I see it as an opportunity for myself to prove that I can be one of the main guys in that role. I’ve got a lot of work to do in that area but I just want to continue working.\" \nHe’s accustomed to additional responsibility. \nAs a 16-year-old, Kaspick was named captain of Team White, one of Canada’s three entries at the 2014 World Under-17 Hockey Challenge. The other two team captains were his Wheat Kings teammates Nolan Patrick and Kale Clague. \nIn NHL Central Scouting’s preliminary report released last month, Kaspick was identified as a player to watch. He earned a ‘C’ rating, which suggests he could be a fourth- to sixth-round NHL entry draft selection. \nWhile Kaspick said he was proud of the honour, he recognizes that he will be scouted on what’s to come this season. \nHe said the experience with Team Canada should help him this winter. He had a goal and an assist in the final as Canada beat Sweden 7-3 in Breclav, Czech Republic to win the title. \n\"Fortunately, getting to go the U18 and representing Canada, first of all was an unbelievable experience life-wise, but for the hockey it kind of prepared me for camp and allowed me to come with an upper hand,\" Kaspick said. \"I was already confident playing in big games so that was an advantage.\" \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:39:53.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
