During their first dispute, the Gators redshirt freshman allegedly held a gun to her head. Around five hours later, they were arguing once again. This time, though, Porter allegedly fired the handgun in her direction. The bullet went through a wall she was leaning against and he left the residence shortly thereafter.\n[via Black Sports Online ]", "external_links": ["http://blacksportsonline.com/home/2015/10/florida-deiondre-porter-shot-at-pregnant-gf-thought-she-cheated-with-teammate/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:24:19.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
