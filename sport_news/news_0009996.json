SAP Extreme Sailing Team is second with 56 points, while Red Bull Sailing Team is third with 54 points.. \nMcMillan learned his trade in the Olympic Tornado class, with two appearances for Team GB at the Games in 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing, and went on to build his reputation with success in the stadium racing format of the ESS. \nAfter the Beijing Olympics, McMillan rejoined the circuit, racing for various teams before joining Oman Sail mid-season in 2011. \nMcMillan is excited about the new challenge. “I’m just looking forward to the next two years, that’s all I’m focused on right now,” he said. \n“I’m fully pumped up for this (America’s Cup) and I want to give it everything I can to make a difference. I want to push Ben as hard as I can, give the best possible input and feedback to the team. I’ve known Ben for a long time and having seen his success, I want to be a part of it over the next two years, helping bring the Cup home.” \nMcMillan’s dominance in the ESS makes him the perfect sparring partner for Ainslie. \nSpeaking to the media, Jono Macbeth, BAR's team manager, said, “Leigh’s ability to win consistently in multihulls made him the obvious choice to join the team.” Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:06:29.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
