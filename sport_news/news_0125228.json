San Diego dropped to 2-3. Vick, having an awful game until the fourth quarter, kept the drive alive with a 24-yard scramble up the middle and then a 16-yard pass to Heath Miller to the 1-yard line one play before Bell’s big run. An unnecessary roughness call against San Diego’s Jahleel Addae moved the ball a half yard closer to the end zone. Bell ran 21 times for 111 yards.\nSan Diego rookie Josh Lambo kicked a go-ahead, 54-yard field goal with 2: 56 left.\nVick, making his second straight start in place of injured Ben Roethlisberger, couldn’t get much going until he and Markus Wheaton hooked up on a 72-yard touchdown on a stop-and-go route to tie the game at 17 with 7:42 left.\nAntonio Gates returned from a four-game PED suspension and caught a 12-yard scoring pass from Philip Rivers in the first quarter and then had an 11-yard grab with 8:02 left to give the Chargers a 17-10 lead. Gates has 101 career TDs, joining Tony Gonzalez (111) as the only tight ends to reach that milestone. It was the 72nd and 73rd scoring connection between Rivers and Gates, the most between a QB and tight end in NFL history.\nSan Diego Chargers defensive end Ricardo Mathews sacks Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mike Vick.

Mike Nugent tied it with a 31-yard field goal on the final play of regulation.\nNugent was good again from 42 yards with 3:36 left in overtime, the ball deflecting off the left upright before going through.

When wide receiver Ryan Grant slipped on a pass route, Alford caught Cousins’ pass and was left with open field down the Falcons’ sideline for the touchdown.\nDevonta Freeman’s apparent 13-yard TD catch in the final minute of regulation was ruled incomplete on a review. Freeman scored on 6-yard run two plays later to give Atlanta a 19-16 lead. Dustin Hopkins’ 52-yard field goal on the final play of regulation forced overtime.\nThe Falcons (5-0) overcame two interceptions and a lost fumble by Matt Ryan. Freeman had 27 carries for 153 yards and the touchdown.

McCown then used more than seven minutes to move the Browns 51 yards before Coons kicked his fourth field goal with 6:43 left in OT.\nMcCown completed 36 of 51 passes with two touchdowns in becoming the first quarterback in Browns history with three straight 300-yard games.

But Denver’s defense made sure it didn’t matter, getting a third defensive touchdown of 2015.\nDerek Carr threw for 249 yards and one touchdown for the Raiders (2-3), but was done in by the interception midway through the fourth quarter with Oakland in position for a possible go-ahead field goal.\nThe Raiders added a late 50-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski following a 48-yard pass interference penalty on Bradley Roby, but Denver recovered the onside kick.\nManning finished 22 for 35 for 266 yards, was sacked twice and had two interceptions. Denver ran for only 43 yards.\nThis was Denver’s second-lowest scoring regular season with Manning as quarterback, ahead of only a seven-point effort last year against St. Louis.\nThe Broncos have now won eight straight in this series but the Raiders had plenty of chances in this one. Janikowski missed a pair of field goals before Carr’s late gaffe ended Oakland’s hopes.\nNEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS 30 — DALLAS COWBOYS 6\nTom Brady threw for two touchdowns, with a 1-yard plunge for another score, as the Patriots pulled away from a powerless Dallas offense missing Tony Romo and Dez Bryant.\nBrady guided two long touchdown drives in the second half after getting sacked five times before halftime, including once each by Greg Hardy and Rolando McClain in their returns from four-game suspensions.\nThe 38-year-old Brady joined Peyton Manning and Fran Tarkenton as the only NFL quarterbacks to get off to 4-0 starts at least four times. The Super Bowl champions won their seventh straight game, including the playoffs last season.\nThe Cowboys (2-3) lost their third straight without Romo and his top receiver, and backup Brandon Weeden lost his 11th in a row as a starter.\nQuarterback Tom Brady #12 of the New England Patriots is congratulated by Tony Romo #9 of the Dallas Cowboys after the Patriots defeated the Cowboys 30-6.

Foles threw a career-worst four interceptions, two in the fourth quarter inside the Packers 10.\nRookie cornerback Quinten Rollins returned an interception 45 yards for a touchdown for a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, and picked off another pass at the 7 with 23 seconds left.\nBuffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor carries for a touchdown in the second half.

Taylor caught a 4-yard pass from Hogan to set up that TD.\nStephon Gilmore intercepted Marcus Mariota’s pass with 1:32 left to seal the win.\nThe Titans (1-3) blew a second straight double-digit lead at home.\nARIZONA CARDINALS 42 — DETROIT LIONS 17\nCarson Palmer threw for three touchdowns, while Matthew Stafford was benched after throwing a third interception.\nThe Cardinals (4-1) have a two-game lead in the NFC West. The Lions (0-5) have the dubious distinction of being the NFL’s only winless team and are off to their worst start since becoming the league’s only 0-16 team in 2008.\nPalmer was poised and efficient, completing 11 of 14 passes for 161 yards, with a 14-yard pass to Darren Fells, an 18-yard connection to John Brown, and a 2-yard strike to Larry Fitzgerald for scores.\nStafford simply struggled, getting picked off on passes well short of receivers and missing at least one wide-open option. He was replaced in the third quarter by Dan Orlovsky.

The preliminary diagnosis was a torn ACL and Charles will have an MRI exam Monday.\nThe Bears quickly seized the momentum.\nAfter Robbie Gould’s second field goal got them going, Cutler led an 88-yard drive that he capped with a 22-yard strike to Marquess Wilson with 3:05 left. The 2-point conversion came up short, but the Bears defense responded by forcing a quick three-and-out.\nWith help from a pass interference call on Chiefs rookie Marcus Peters, the Bears quickly moved downfield. That’s when Cutler took a snap from the shotgun, dropped the ball, picked it up and spotted Forte running past safety Husain Abdullah in the end zone for the go-ahead score.\nThe Chiefs (1-4) tried a 66-yard field goal that came up short as time expired.\nJay Cutler #6 of the Chicago Bears throws a pass at Arrowhead Stadium during the game against the Kansas City Chiefs.

They snapped a three-game losing streak at home that dated to last season.\nDrew Brees had three turnovers leading to 17 points for Philadelphia, and the Saints fell to 1-4 a week after an overtime win against Dallas.\nBradford and the rest of the offense struggled through the first quarter of the season. It looked like more of the same after he threw two INTs in the end zone, but he bounced back from the rough start. Philadelphia rushed for 186 yards.\nTAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS 38 — JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS 31\nDoug Martin ran for 123 yards and scored three touchdowns, helping Jameis Winston rebound from his worst pro performance.\nThe Bucs (2-3) snapped an 11-game home losing streak that dated to December 2013, the same month the Jaguars (1-4) began an equally agonizing road skid that now stands at 12.\nWinston threw for 209 yards and one touchdown without an interception, redeeming himself after turning the ball over five times in a 14-point loss to Carolina last week.\nBlake Bortles passed for 303 yards and four TDs, but also threw an interception that set up a Bucs touchdown.

Johnson finished with six catches for 77 yards.\nThe Colts extended their AFC South division winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games.\nThe 40-year-old Hasselbeck was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury.\nHasselbeck’s performance was even more impressive given the fact that he was battling a bacterial infection that hospitalized him this week. He started feeling ill just before halftime Sunday in a victory over Jacksonville and didn’t start feeling better until Thursday night.\n“You get over the age of 30, they kind of count you out,” Johnson said. “But we proved to people that we could still play.”\nJohnson entered the game without a catch in the last two games after having just one such game in his entire career in Houston.\nHouston quarterback Ryan Mallett was replaced by Brian Hoyer after going down hard from an illegal hit midway through the second quarter.\nHoyer finished with 312 yards passing with two touchdowns and an interception.
