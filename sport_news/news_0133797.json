Comment   By OJC staff Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 8:00 AM By OJC staff Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 8:00 AM Otero Junior College is the first two-year institution in Colorado to announce the addition of a wrestling program. It is expected that the program will bring an additional 30-50 students to the campus each year. OJC’s athletics director Gary Addington is excited about what this will mean for southeast Colorado. “This is going to be good for the Arkansas Valley with its strong wrestling tradition that spans all the way to the Kansas border,” Addington said. “Members of the community are extremely supportive of the plan.” At this time, there are few wrestling programs in the state, and they are all at four-year institutions. “OJC having a program gives opportunities to kids who may not see them otherwise,” Addington explained. “A two-year institution opens doors to everybody. These wrestlers will have the opportunity to complete a two-year degree, but also have an increased opportunity to move on to both wrestle and study at a four-year school.” There will be 20 letters of intent available. OJC has multiple other forms of need-based financial assistance and academic scholarships available to all students. The next step will involve a large scale search for a coach who will fit with OJC Athletics’ philosophy: combining hard work, persistence and dedication with the ultimate goal of success in the classroom and in athletic pursuits. The goal is to have a coach in place by January 2016 to begin recruiting for the team. In addition, OJC will be building another unit in the Conley Complex to house the additional students. The team will initially wrestle open tournaments in Kansas and Wyoming as well as dual meets with teams in the region. There are a few other junior/community colleges looking to add programs in the next few years, both in Colorado and in neighboring states.
