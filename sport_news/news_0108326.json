I'm very excited about the opportunity to continue my career in Major League Baseball and there couldn't be a better landing spot than San Diego.”\nCounting tonight's game, Orsillo still has five games remaining on his NESN contract. On Sunday, in his last game at Fenway after 15 years, he was the subject of a prolonged ovation from fans after the Red Sox played a between-innings tribute to him.\n“Last Sunday at Fenway Park will stay with me forever as will the 15 years that I spent in Boston,\" said Orsillo. \"I will never forget the fans and the way that they treated me and said good-bye to me.”\nThe Red Sox and NESN underestimated the backlash of fans -- some 62,000 signatures were collected on an online petition -- from removing Orsillo from telecasts. Orsillo, who took the news hard, appreciated the support.\n“All the support – I've heard it all, I've read them and I'm completely humbled by their feelings for me,” said Orsillo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:03:02.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
