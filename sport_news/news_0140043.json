So they set out to determine whether poor performance on a smell-based test indicated an animal’s lifespan.\n“Older animals that were more successful in finding the odor lived about 16 percent longer than animals that were less good at moving toward the smell,” the researchers said.\nMany questions remain about what changes as animals age,” said Sarah Leinwand, a graduate student and the author of the paper. “We want to keep looking at what is changing to cause some animals to have better functioning nervous systems and to live longer.\"\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
