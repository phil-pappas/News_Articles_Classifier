They are some of the world’s most fascinating discoveries, which help tell the story of human evolution. Now treasures ranging from the remains of Cro-Magnon man to the celebrated 23,000-year-old Venus of Lespugue – as well as René Descartes’s skull – are once again to go on show with the rebirth of one of the world’s greatest museums of prehistory.\nMore than a decade ago Paris’s Musée de l’Homme was facing extinction. Former president Jacques Chirac had purloined half of its collection for his grand legacy project, the Quai Branly museum of arts and civilisations , leaving the mankind museum without a raison d’être .\nAlthough it still had its unique collection hidden away in an ageing building whose 1930s parquet floor creaked and cracked, visitors dwindled and the future looked bleak. So the museum did what it knew best … it evolved.\nThis week President François Hollande will unveil the new museum after a six-year closure and a €92m facelift.\n“Humans evolve. So has their museum … What does it mean to be human? Where do we come from? Where are we heading?” the museum asks, before setting out to provide some scientific answers to the first two questions, and a little random guesswork to the last.\nIt is five days before the president is due and Professor Evelyne Heyer, a specialist in genetic anthropology and a member of the museum’s scientific committee, is walking through a building site. The wooden floors have gone, replaced with ground-to-ceiling white and silver staircases. The displays are still mostly empty, apart from a few animal brains and skulls. The mummies and mammoth depiction are still in their wooden packing cases.\nThe museum’s original purpose was to amass in one place objects that defined mankind and showed its evolution, its similarity and its variety as well as cultural objects that illustrated this history. Quai Branly took the ethnological exhibits, but Heyer insists that there is now no overlap or conflict of interests between the two museums. “Their approach is purely artistic; ours is scientific,” she says in a tone that suggests the conversation might be closed.\nI’m an eternal optimist, but not many people were optimistic about our future 10 years ago\nProfessor Evelyne Heyer\nMusée de l’Homme staff were left traumatised by the controversial decision to move 300,000 exhibits to Quai Branly on the president’s orders. Heyer admits there followed a few years’ uncertainty over “whether the museum would even continue to exist”.\n“It was a shock … we’d lost half our collection and nobody knew what would happen. I’m an eternal optimist, but not many people were optimistic about our future 10 years ago,” Heyer said. “Instead, we used the opportunity to reflect on what we could become, and we came up with the idea of concentrating on the evolution of man. Now, the museum is simply superb.”\nOne of the museum’s more spectacular exhibits features 80 busts, real-life models of humans from around the globe, and an interactive display presenting 30 of the world’s 7,000 languages.\nAnother section reminds visitors that the members of the species Homo sapiens , wherever they exist, have 99.9% the same DNA. Physical differences can be largely explained by genetics, physiological adaptations to the environment, accidental factors and lifestyle.\n“We have, as a species, very little genetic difference between us, but we are all so very different. This uniqueness and diversity is very important,” Heyer said. “I hope that people will be enthralled and learn something. After all, our main goal as a scientific institution is to instruct.”\nBruno David, president of the National Museum of Natural History, of which the museum of mankind is a part, reminds visitors that natural sciences face issues that cannot be tackled without “massive input from the human sciences”.\n“The reopening of the Musée de l’Homme, just days before the 2015 Paris climate conference where world decision-makers will discuss the future of the planet, will be an opportunity … to restate the museum’s vocation as a guarantor of respect for and upholding of the diversity and universality of humanity and our environment,” he wrote.\nOn the way out, Heyer points to a display in the “future” section that features some Hollywood superheroes. “For the future … all we know is that mankind will evolve,” she said. “We just don’t know in what sense or direction.”", "external_links": ["http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/", "http://www.museedelhomme.fr/"], "published": "2015-10-10T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:00:50.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
