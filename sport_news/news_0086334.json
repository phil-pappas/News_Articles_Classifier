They won’t always be the top-4 in CPP value, but, promise to provide value at their relative cost. By default, our cost/point calculations are developed using Draft Kings ‘ pricing strategy, but, you can toggle between DK and Fanduel using the overall table below the picks. Week 7 DFS Plays: Quarterback \nRyan Fitzpatrick – Draft Kings Salary: $5,200 – My Rank: QB11 – Salary Rank: QB17 – Cost/Point: $289 The thinking mans QB, Ryan Fitzpatrick could have a solid day against New England (Photo: Elsa/Getty Images North America). \nThe Patriots-Jets rivalry might be as intriguing this year as it was during the early Rex Ryan days, with Darrelle Revis back in New York and with the Jets playing playoff caliber football through six weeks. Part of that success can be attributed to a well-managed offense led by Ryan Fitzpatrick . No doubt, the Jets will look to Chris Ivory to carry them early but with New England expected to put up some points, even against the Jets’ strong defense, they’ll have to turn to Fitzpatrick and co. in the second half. That’s when Fitz can take advantage of a defense that has allowed the 6th most FPPG to QBs this season, including multiple touchdowns in three of their five games. Fitz has accomplished the same in four of his five outings, and should be able to use the size of Brandon Marshall to take advantage of New England’s smaller secondary. Week 7 DFS Plays: Running Back \nTodd Gurley – Draft Kings Salary: $5,000 – My Rank: RB4 – Salary Rank: RB14 – Cost/Point: $280 \nGurley hasn’t yet found the endzone, and, his price hasn’t gone through the roof as a result. Expect both facts to change this week. Expect that to change against a Browns defense that has allowed a league high 147.8 yards per game on the ground to opposing defenses. As a central feature of the team’s game plan, look for Gurley to get plenty of opportunity in a game that should be evenly matched. \nMatt Jones – Draft Kings Salary: $3,200 – My Rank: RB26- Salary Rank: RB53 – Cost/Point: $315 \nWith Chris Thompson unlikely to go, Jones has a chance to return to relevance this week for Washington. He’s evidently back to full health and while Alfred Morris will net some early down carries, they’ll be calling Jones’ numbers on passing downs and that’s where your DFS bread is buttered. Thompson caught six or more passes in three of his last four games. Count on Jones to post similar numbers, and for him to get some opportunities in the red zone. \nDarren McFadden – Draft Kings Salary: $3,100 – My Rank: RB29- Salary Rank: RB54 – Cost/Point: $294 \nDMC is another back who should add significant value in the passing game. He’ll face a Giants team that has allowed 40 receptions to RBs so far this season (the 5th highest total in the league), and will do so coming off a nine reception, ten target game in his first week since taking the passing down role after Lance Dunbar ‘s injury. In full point formats like Draft Kings, McFadden’s floor is in the seven to eight point range this week, and he’ll cost just above the minimum. Week 7 DFS Plays: Wide Receiver \nDorial Green-Beckham – Draft Kings Salary: $3,200 – My Rank: WR38 – Salary Rank: WR60- Cost/Point: $304 \nFrom floor backs, we arrive at upside receivers. DGB finally got in the mix for Tennessee last week and delivered a solid three reception, 57 yard performance on six targets – all season highs. This week, with Harry Douglas out of the lineup he could set new personal bests against Atlanta. With the Falcons expected to get back on track and easily dispense of the Titans and QB Zach Mettenberger this week, DGB could see a lot of work in the second half with the team in catch up mode and taking shots. Count on a reasonable floor for this price point, and the opportunity to make some noise. \nRiley Cooper – Draft Kings Salary: $3,000 – My Rank: WR47 – Salary Rank: WR72 – Cost/Point: $334 \nIt’s easy to like Cooper because he managed to find the endzone last week, but, I’m chasing numbers larger than his one TD. Numbers like 13 targets over the last two weeks (the second most on the team) and an aDot of 18.8. If he can keep up his 6.5 target average in this game, that aDot number represents a big opportunity to make plays. He’s becoming Sam Bradford ‘s go to target with the deep ball, for better or worse, and could benefit from extra attention paid to Jordan Matthews this week, as I noted for FantasyPros . Week 7 DFS Plays: Tight End \nLadarius Green – Draft Kings Salary: $2,900 – My Rank: TE15 – Salary Rank: TE21 – Cost/Point: $361 \nIf Antonio Gates plays, I’m less excited about Green but there is still opportunity here. Gates played on 75% of the snaps last week, up considerably from his season-opening 57.3 the week prior, and I’d expect that number to look more like Week 5 than Week 6 given the injury he’s dealing with. Meanwhile, Green has been targeted nine times in the two games since Gates returned – hardly overwhelming numbers, but, certainly palatable. Should Gates miss the game, the upside is even greater. In any event, San Diego’s two TEs will face a Raiders defense that has given up six TDs to the position and has seen Tight Ends targeted 11 times in the red zone through five games. At $2,900 on Draft Kings, he’s a complete bargain who should be good for four to five catches at a minimum with the opportunity to find the end zone. Week 7 DFS Plays: Defense \nPittsburgh Steelers – Draft Kings Salary: $2,600 – My Rank: DST4 – Salary Rank: DST19 – Cost/Point: $294 \nThe Steelers have won two of three games without Ben Roethlisberger while getting poor QB play from Michael Vick . They’ve managed to do so because they’re holding opponents off the score board – 23 points in OT to Baltimore, 20 points to San Diego and a mere 13 to one of the highest scoring offenses in the league last week in Arizona. They’ll play a Chiefs team without its best weapon on offense, and with a QB who has been sacked 24 times this season (the third highest in the league). At $2,600 they’re a bargain.
