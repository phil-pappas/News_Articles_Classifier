The only drawback is that the Warriors’ one loss was to Lexington during the recent Bishop England Invitational. That could be bad news for first-year Wando coach Eric Praedel’s team. The Warriors likely will face Lexington again in the Class AAAA state playoffs in a few weeks. Wando dealt a previously unbeaten Lexington team a 5-1 setback in the 2014 Lower State final. Lexington is unbeaten again after knocking off both Wando and four-time defending Class AA state champion Bishop England in the Bishop England tournament. Wando gained a measure of revenge with a win over defending Class AAAA state champion Dutch Fork in the BE event. The Warriors’ 4-3 loss to Lexington was somewhat surprising because Wando has practically the entire team back from last year. Bishop England (11-3) already has wrapped up its region, and is looking toward the state playoffs where the Bishops appear to be headed for another Lower State championship showdown with Waccamaw. This time, Bishop England will have to travel to Waccamaw if the two teams meet in the state playoffs. Coach Kristin Fleming Arnold’s BE team’s other two losses came at the hands of Wando. The Bishops did come up with a big win, other than the Ashley Hall one, in their tournament by upending Dutch Fork. Ashley Hall top pick Ashley Hall has taken firm control of SCISA Class AAA Region III, holding a 26-0 individual match edge over the region’s other two teams — Porter-Gaud and Pinewood Prep. In her 30th year as Ashley Hall’s coach, Mary Gastley and her team are solid favorites to appear in the state championship match one week from next Saturday. Hammond, with talented No. 1 Brittany Desmond, looks like the team to beat outside of Ashley Hall. The Panthers (12-4) lost to tournament host Bishop England, but used the tournament to reverse an earlier loss to SCHSL Class AAA power Myrtle Beach. Another of the Panthers’ losses was to SCISA Class AA/former Class AAA power Hilton Head Prep. After suffering a 5-4 loss to Porter-Gaud in last year’s state final, the Panthers are still led by freshman Michaela Cuoco, with added firepower from newcomer freshman Rebecca Spratt. “Getting a player of Rebecca’s caliber has helped the lineup (at No. 2). It gives us more depth down the line,” Gastley said. Rogers in Europe Shelby Rogers is in Europe, ready to celebrate her 23rd birthday on Tuesday. Actually, she is playing a little tennis, too. The Charleston touring pro is in Linz, Austria, this weekend attempting to qualify for the $225,000 WTA Tour tournament that starts there on Monday. Now ranked No. 151 in the world after making the final of a $50,000 event in Las Vegas last weekend, Rogers also plans to play another $225,000 event the following week in Luxembourg. Local resident Jessica Pegula (No. 160) was a quarterfinalist in the current $50,000 ITF event in Kirkland, Wash. Samantha Crawford (No. 182) lost in the second round in singles, but was a semifinalist in doubles. Local notes Legend Oaks’ seventh annual “Gives Back Charity Weekends,” which included tennis, golf and a silent auction dinner, raised $32,516 to support Meals on Wheels of Summerville and One80 Place. Brenda Carter helped the U.S. women’s 65-plus team capture the Kitty Godfree Cup recently in Umag, Croatia, in the International Tennis Federation world team championships. Diane Barker and Matt Hane won their 11th national mother/son championship recently at the Country Club of Louisiana in Baton Rouge where Matt is the head tennis pro. City of Charleston tennis pro Davy Hairston and longtime local tennis coach/pro Billy Silcox have scheduled a “discussion and tennis social” for 2 p.m. on Oct. 25 at the College of Charleston tennis complex at Patriots Point to discuss plans to bring back the “City Tennis Championships in 2016.” Reach James Beck at jamesbecktennis@gmail.com.
