Coach Jim Caldwell declined to provide details on Wilson's concussion other than to say the Lions are following the league's rules related to the injury.\n\"I don't particularly discuss when and all of those kinds of things, but I can tell you that we follow the protocol and he's on the return-to-play protocol. And I'm done talking about it,\" Caldwell said Thursday.\nDETROIT NEWS\nLombardi jumps to the booth, Lions offense picks up\nCaldwell typically declines to share injury information, but concussions are often handled differently than others. The NFL now has multiple independent doctors at each game to ensure players do not re-enter a game with a brain injury, and the players have to be cleared medically before returning.\nIn Week 7 last year, LaAdrian Waddle suffered a concussion late in the fourth quarter of the win over the Saints on an extra point. Then, Waddle returned for the kneeldown at the end of the game.\nCaldwell declined to say whether or not Wilson went through any concussion protocol during the game. On the first defensive drive in overtime, Wilson's helmet came off, but it's unclear if that's when he suffered the injury. He returned for the final defensive drive of overtime.\n\"I'm going to move on,\" he said.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:17:53.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
