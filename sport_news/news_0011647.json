Newton, the Carolina Panthers' field general, is certainly playing at a high level, which is one of the reasons why the Panthers (5-0) are undefeated. The Philadelphia Eagles (3-3) are coming off a big Monday night win over the New York Giants and will face the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C., on Sunday night (8:30 p.m. NBC-TV). The Eagles have the task of trying to contain Newton. The 6-foot-5, 245-pounder has the ability to throw the ball down the field for big plays. He can also use his speed and get out in the open field in running for huge chunks of yardage. So far this season, Newton has thrown for 1,078 yards with eight touchdowns and four interceptions. He has 50 carries for 225 yards. A week ago, he tossed a crucial 26-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen to help Carolina nip the Seattle Seahawks. Eagles defensive coordinator Bill Davis has watched Newton develop over the years. Although the Eagles defense has played well this year, Davis knows the importance of keeping Newton from utilizing his multitalented skills. \"You know, Cam is really -- it does jump out at you, the progression he has made over his career, and this year he's really running the offense at a high rate right now,\" Davis said. \"You're going to get your runs from him, which is unique to the NFL. You're going to get about eight to 10 runs from him that you have to prepare for. \"But probably more impressively is how he has kind of settled into the passing game. He's not making mistakes. He's taking what you give him and he's moving the ball a little bit. He did a great job on the last drive at Seattle,\" Davis added. Last year, the Eagles crushed the Panthers, 45-21, at Lincoln Financial Field. In that contest, the defense sacked Newton nine times. The Eagles could use a strong pass rush from defensive linemen Fletcher Cox and Bennie Logan as well as linebackers Brandon Graham and Connor Barwin. Eagles head coach Chip Kelly believes Newton is not the same player as last year. Kelly is concerned about Newton as well as Carolina's overall running game. \"The challenge is they are going to try to pound you,\" Kelly said. \"They have got a back in Jonathan [Stewart] who is a big, physical downhill running back. And then you have a quarterback and it's different than other zone-read-type teams you face where it's a quick, agile quarterback that's going to break outside -- in Cam who can pound you, too, because he's -- unlike many quarterbacks -- got to be the biggest quarterback in the league from that standpoint in terms of rushing -- him [Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben] Roethlisberger. But [the Steelers] don't run Ben, [the Panthers] run Cam. \"So I think they are just going to try to wear you down and pound you a little bit. I think their offensive line is built that way. Their running game is built that way,\" the Eagles head coach added. \"So it's, can we stand in there and go to toe-to-toe with them? [That] is going to be the challenge for us.\" By Donald Hunt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:41:43.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
