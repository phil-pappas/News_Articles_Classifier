Morse led 1-0 at halftime. \nAlexis Mazurek tied the game for Oceanside off a penalty corner with 6:44 left in regulation, while Michaela Wright scored the game-winner with 42 seconds remaining, off assists by Clara Feltus and Makayla VanBlarcom. \nKatie More scored in the first half for Morse. \nOceanside held a 19-3 edge in shots and a 12-1 edge in penalty corners. \nLauren Hoppe made two saves in the cage for Oceanside, while Madeline Baker made 16 saves in goal for Morse. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Oceanside (3-6-1, 16.8112 points) is 10th, while Foxcroft Academy of Dover-Foxcroft (10-0, 68.2143 points) is first in the 14-team region. The top 10 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nLeavitt 1, Camden Hills 0 \nAt Turner Sept. 29, the Hornets stung the Windjammers, prevailing by one goal. The game was called with 18:17 left in the second half due to rain. Games are 30-minute halves. \n\"It sprinkled on and off during the first half,” said Camden Hills coach Lindsey Clement. “Soon after the second half started, it began to pour and the refs stopped the game. We waited about 15 minutes to see if the weather was going to let up, but it didn't. Thankfully the refs gave us another opportunity to start playing again, but by that time the field had standing water on it. Visibility was poor, and the ball would stop dead in the puddles so they called it early.” \nAllie Belaine scored the lone goal for Leavitt with seven minutes left in the first half. \nCamden Hills held a 5-3 lead in shots and a 6-2 edge in penalty corners. Jenna Stearns played in the cage for the Windjammers. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Camden Hills (6-3, 22.9592 points) is eighth, while Foxcroft Academy of Dover-Foxcroft (10-0, 68.2143 points) is first in the 14-team region.
