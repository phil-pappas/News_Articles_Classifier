The other player released by the Celtics was guard Corey Walden, who was not considered a threat to make the team to start the season. \nJones , who was initially selected with pick 28 in the 2012 NBA Draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder, was acquired by Boston this off season , with the thought that he could compete for a spot on the team’s roster as a swing man. \nJones never really got going this preseason, and as a result lost out on snagging one of the final roster spots available. Barring any last second swaps the C’s are set with a full roster, that mirrors the prediction from earlier this week .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:06:12.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
