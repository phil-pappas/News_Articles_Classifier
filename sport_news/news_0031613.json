While tennis icon Butch Buchholz states, \"Freshest face in tennis - the game really needs this guy.\" Bottom line is, he does it all, and very well.Player, coach (to all ages and abilities), entertainer, emcee, musician, motivator, author, parent ... he's been a voice of reason that rings loud and clear for the game of tennis and more and he's taken time to give us a personal interview you should enjoy reading. 1. Can you give the readers a little background on how you became involved in the game of tennis and why you have made it your line of work in life? The Alex Olmedo Circle Story: When I was about 10, my Dad, who was a VP at then Western Airlines, came home from work and said, \"OK, guys, go take a shower and change clothes - we're going to see a pro tennis tournament at the LA Tennis Club. Our company is a sponsor and we got free tickets and we're going.\"\"No way,\" my brother, Carl, and I chimed in.My Dad, a product of the Depression (as he often says) replied, \"Yes, we are. These tickets are free. And we're gonna use 'em. Now shower and change! Fast!\" Off we went that night to see the Adler Sox Pro Championships at the Club that was located in North Hollywood and seated about 2,500 and I think the total purse was similarly, $2,500, and had the likes of Rod Laver and Roy Emerson and Ken Rosewall. We got to our box seats in the front row right as the players were warming up and there was this good looking Inca God named Alex Olmedo. Tall, tanned, athletic with a beautiful white sweater with purple trim. Thwock!! He cracked a beautiful forehand volley at the net right near my face. It was incredible. And I've been on a tennis court most every day since I saw him hit that volley. And you talk about a poetic circle, listen to the rest of the story.Two years ago Mike 'n Bob and I were doing an exo and clinic at the picturesque Wailea Tennis Club on Maui. When we finished the clinic for a couple hundred of the local juniors, I said, \"Who's the Mom of this cute and hustling little guy right here?\" A beautiful young lady came down from the stands and said, \"I am and my name is Amy. And thanks for the clinic. My little son here was inspired to play tennis by your two boys - Mike 'n' Bob. By the way, his grandfather was a great player too.\" Yes, the little guy's grandfather was Alex Olmedo, the Hall of Famer from Peru who won Wimbledon and the Australian Open in 1959. He also led the U.S. to the Davis Cup Championship and won the NCAA singles and doubles for USC. He had inspired me to play and now my twin sons had inspired his grandson. The point here is that attending one motivational tennis event can change your life and, at the very least, it can get you fired up to play the great game of tennis - and if you already play, it will get you pumped to go after it more and play even better! 2. Your wife also has a very solid tennis background, how involved is she with the game of tennis today? She still coaches the brothers whenever they are in town or when she is out on the tour. She still gives advice to parents and coaches from time to time and she also helped me write the book. She was No. 1 in the U.S. in the 16s and No. 2 in the 18s and made it to No. 11 in the U.S. Women Pros. Won the Swedish Open back in the day and if memory serves she made the Wimbledon Semis in Mixed and the Quarters of the Doubles. She coached the brothers each and every day when they were juniors. Great lady. Great coach. She is a reluctant speaker from time to time, but she always does a super job. She loves riding her beautiful Arabian horse, Elan, in the Malibu Mountains most every day. 3. Your boys Mike and Bob have accomplished everything and then some in the world of tennis. What role have you played in their adult lives to help them along? Kathy and I both still coach them but we don't ride the rails like we used to all through the juniors and at Stanford and their first few years on the tour. We are in touch with them most every day still by phone or email or text. I am with them at most U.S. tournaments, because I emcee and do clinics. We also play lots of music together when their Bryan Bros. Band performs at tournaments and charity events.The tennis lifestyle has its ups and downs. The highs are super exhilarating and the lows are as low as Death Valley. It is filled with thrills, chills and adventure as my pal and tennis icon, Billie Jean King would say. Our nuclear family has always been very, very close and supportive and we have always had a good sense of humor and we have tried to take it all with a grain of salt. And we have done our very best to leave the tennis campsite cleaner than we found it - and I hope we have succeeded in that quest. 4. I know you can't speak for Mike and Bob, but how much longer do you see them playing on the tour? They are 37 now and have been out on the tour since they were 20 years old - 17 years. They turned pro after their sophomore year at Stanford having won the NCAA Team Championships two years in a row and their second year, Bob won the NCAA Singles and together they won the NCAA Doubles. Sometimes in the press they have said they would hang it up after the Rio Olympics in the summer of 2016. Sometimes they have said they will play for another five years. They have been number one for most of the past 12 years ... 10 times No. 1 and twice No. 2. They have reached ever single goal they have ever set since they were little guys - and they have blown the doubles record book to smithereens. Bob has two children now - Micaela, 3 ½, and Bobby Jr., 1 ½, and he and Michelle are expecting their third child in a few weeks. I think the kids and being home more will drive them off the tour long before the other players do. It is tough to quit when you are No. 1 and very, very few athletes in any sport through the years have done that. I suspect they do not know when they will actually hang it up. Could be a year - could be five years or sometime in between. And what will happen with the game of doubles when they are no longer spearheading that avenue? No singles player and no doubles team is bigger than the game. There are always new stars coming down the road in tennis and in all pro sports. 5. Not so many years ago the powers of tournament directors were talking about ending doubles at many events. Since the changes made at that time (no ad scoring - third set tie-break) - has doubles made enough of a comeback or would you say the crowds are still not where they should and need to be? The crowds for the Bros. are overwhelming everywhere they play. Try and get a seat to watch them play at Indian Wells or the U.S. Open or Atlanta or Miami or anywhere in the world. They just did three days of Exos in Atlanta, Midland and Camarillo and all of those were sold out as well. We had a blast traveling around with big John Isner and Sam Querrey and their Bryan Bros. Band to all of those events. 6. What suggestions do you have to help the men's and women's game of doubles? Simple, just get it on TV more. Everywhere I go, the No. 1 question I get asked is Why don't they show more doubles on TV? Go to any park or club or school at 10 on Saturday morning and what do you see? Yeah, lots of doubles being played. Fans want to watch the best doubles players and teams in the world. The Tennis Channel is trying to do just that and if you get DirecTV, they show five or six courts at each Grand Slam and it is easy to tune in to the doubles. Secondly, we need more doubles at junior tournaments.If we had more doubles programming, promotion, and coaching we could greatly increase the number of kids playing tennis. Doubles gives our sport more width and breadth. Doubles is fun for juniors and it really rounds out skills and teaches additional life lessons - and some youngsters just love the \"team thing.\" Plus, it gives them a second chance if they lose their singles match at a tournament. And don't forget mixed doubles - boys and girls truly love that and there are also great life lessons inherent in mixed. 7. You have been a one-man-show in emceeing many professional/charities events each year, and also in promotion of the \"Brothers\" on a large scale. Would you consider doing the public relations for both the professional men's and women's game of doubles if asked? I am trying to cut back on my schedule, not increase it. I am already doing 180 a year out on the road and am really, really trying to cut back to 120 days a year. When you get out on the road it is tough to get off ... I would love to do PR for doubles for men and women in my next life. I would also like to be a college coach in my next life. And a rock 'n' roll star. And a landscape architect. I love planting trees and am proud to say I have planted hundreds in my life. 8. You are a musician and enjoy what that has to offer. Do you ever wonder where you'd be today if you'd taken that passion and run with it as much as you have the tennis ... and tell us what the music means to you. I truly love music as much as I love tennis. Same for Mike 'n' Bob. I have been in bands my whole life and still have one. I have been in church groups, school choirs, school bands, surf bands, folk groups, and rock 'n' roll bands. I still have my Wayne Bryan Band and the Bros. have their Bryan Bros. Band and we often play in each other's. If I ever get a few weeks off I love to go into my music studio and record all day and night and into the wee wee hours. I play piano, guitar, bass, drums, accordion and trumpet - and I sing. 9. Family - the books you've written and your way of life show the dedication of hard work, rules and love and laughter make life so much better. What is your life philosophy in that regard and how did you reach those thoughts? Yes. There it is. Love. Laughter. Fun. Enthusiasm. I have been a student of teaching, mentoring, leadership, parenting, and coaching my whole life. I have studied history. I am a lawyer as well and know my way around the law. I have studied music. Landscaping. My book - \"Raising Your Child to be a Champion, in Athletics, Arts and Academics\" - has it all there. No ego here, but every parent should read it and fast. You can get it in the Book Section of Tennis Warehouse. 10. Is Davis Cup doing as well today as you think it should be? I really like Davis Cup. I have had tears flowing at many times during the Bros. career - when they won the National 18s Doubles at KZoo, when they were first year players as 17 year olds; when they won the U.S. Open Jr. Doubles; each time they won the NCAA team championship at Stanford; when they won the NCAA doubles; when they won their first doubles match on the ATP Tour; when they won their first tournament on the tour; when they won their first Grand Slam; when they won No. 100 at the U.S. Open last year; and when they broke the Woodies record with No. 62 at LA. But I have never, ever had tears flowing longer than I did win they clinched the Davis Cup for the USA in early December of 2007 with their teammates Andy and James looking on and 12,000 people going nuts in the indoor arena in Portland and with all American tennis fans looking on over TV. I like Davis Cup as it is. Could there be tweaks? Sure, but I basically like it as is. 11. Have you ever been to Prescott? Have been to Tucson many, many times and same with Phoenix and Surprise and I have been through Prescott, but not sure I have spent any time there. Mike and Bob and so many of the juniors from our club loved playing the Fiesta and Copper Bowls there through the years. And they also played the pro tournament at the Fairmont Princess Resort as well as U of A and ASU their two years at Stanford. 12. And what would it take to get you to come by on a visit? Easy. Donate $10,000 to the Bryan Brothers Foundation. Or pay me $7,500 for a weekend or $5,000 for a day. Cover my flight and hotel. And/or bring my Wayne Bryan Band in for $7,500 for one night. Four flights and four hotel rooms. Chris Howard is a local USPTA tennis professional with over 40 years in the racquet and fitness industry.
