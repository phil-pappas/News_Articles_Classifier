And with one more win, they'll have a chance to show off their power in a return trip to the World Series.\nZobrist hit a two-run homer on knuckleballer R.A. Dickey 's fourth pitch of the game, Alex Rios connected an inning later and the Royals romped past the Toronto Blue Jays 14-2 Tuesday for a 3-1 lead in the American League Championship Series.\nLorenzo Cain scored on a passed ball and Mike Moustakas had a sacrifice fly in an LCS-record four-run top of the first.\n\"We're a good offensive team,\" Eric Hosmer said. \"Our park, our style of play is a little different. We like to use our legs and be athletic, but when we come to some of these parks where the fences aren't as deep we've got some guys that can put the ball in the seats.\"\nMore Information \nALCS \nAll games televised by FS1\nKansas City 3, Toronto 1 \nGame 1: Kansas City, 5-0\nGame 2: Kansas City, 6-3\nGame 3: Toronto, 11-8\nGame 4: Kansas City, 14-2\nWednesday: Kansas City (Volquez 13-9) at Toronto (Estrada 13-8), 4:07 p.m.\nx-Friday: at Kansas City, 8:07 p.m.\nx-Saturday: at Kansas City, 8:07 p.m.\n\nAlcides Escobar had four RBIs and Cain three as the Royals bounced back from an 11-8 loss Monday. Kansas City led 5-2 in the seventh before breaking away.\nBlue Jays infielder Cliff Pennington relieved in the ninth inning, becoming the first primarily position player to pitch in the postseason, STATS said. Greeted by cheers, he allowed two hits and got one out.\nKansas City can win the pennant Wednesday, when Edinson Volquez starts against Toronto's Marco Estrada in a Game 1 rematch.\n\"It's a do-or-die game for us,\" Toronto manager John Gibbons said. \"But they do it all year. I think these guys will let this one go and they'll show up to play tomorrow. ... I know these guys will be ready.\"\nAfter flashing power to build a 5-0 lead on the long ball, the Royals returned to their pesky ways late in the game against the Blue Jays' struggling bullpen. They scored nine runs with three more sacrifice flies, a barrage of slashing hits and heads-up baserunning.\n\"We were really focused on being productive collectively,\" Rios said. \"And I guess we're doing a pretty good job of doing that.\"\nBlue Jays fans had seen enough after Cain's two-run single in the eighth, turning their ever-optimistic cheers to jeers when Mark Lowe replaced Ryan Tepera.\nThe 36-year-old Chris Young bested Dickey, 40, in a matchup of veteran starters â€” only the pairing of the Yankees ' Randy Johnson (43) and Detroit's Kenny Rogers (41) in the 2006 ALDS tops the duo for combined age.\nBut like his counterpart's effort in Game 4 of the ALDS against Texas, the 6-foot-10 Young was lifted one out shy of qualifying for a win when Ned Yost went to his bullpen with a runner on first with two outs in the fifth. Yost wasn't willing to take any chances against Josh Donaldson , who earlier hit an RBI double.\nDickey never had a chance to get that first playoff victory in a 13-year big-league career.\n\"We feel good. We like the way we're playing right now,\" Yost said. \"Our offense has been really, really good.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:24:45.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
