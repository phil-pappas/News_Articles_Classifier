It’s a place — 120 yards long by 53.33 yards wide — where life is seemingly put on hold. \nFor 60 minutes, nothing else matters — not family, not friends, not race, not upbringing. Athleticism aside, everyone is equal. \nBut for reasons that Martez Carter can’t explain, his world is different. He sees how he’s escaped a deep, dark world filled with trials and tribulations. \nBefore each game, Carter, a local product from Richwood High School, puts on his Grambling State University garb, usually black and gold emblazoned with a “G,” and takes the field to play the game he loves and appreciates more than ever at this point in his young, yet budding, career. \nThen he closes his eyes and visualizes everything like a painting he spent years constructing. \n“I can’t make the people see but if I close my eyes or if I stare off into the sky, I actually visualize the performance on one side and where I came from on the other side,” Carter said. “I can actually see where I am today and where I come from. \n“It’s all there for the taking. I don’t ever want to go back. I don’t mind talking about it, but I never want to go back. All I want to do is go up from here.” \nThe going back part is a long novel for Carter, one that entails a rough upbringing and a scattered family life that left him homeless at times. He’s dealt with family tragedy and even found himself behind bars, yet lives to tell a story of hope. \nThe current picture depicts a success story many can relate to. Carter, a virtual unknown in 2014, has become an overnight sensation during his sophomore year, establishing himself as one of the top FCS playmakers in the country. \n“His story is a story of a lot of kids, not just in our area but across the country,” said Eric Davis, who is an assistant principle at Richwood. “This is a story they need to hear. They need to hear about the kid who overcomes all the obstacles, the kid that people probably felt he wouldn’t do anything. This is the success story we’re talking about.” Mr. Excitement RB/KR has 8 touchdowns in 2015 \nTo understand the full personality of Martez Carter, all it takes watching him take a few snaps on the football field. He plays how he acts off the field — confident, charismatic, flashy yet humble, and most of all, dynamic. \n“That’s what he calls himself, Mr. Excitement,” Grambling quarterback Johnathan Williams said laughing. “Anytime he touches the ball it can go for distance. He’s definitely living up to it.” \nThe name didn’t actually come from Carter. In 2014, Carter, an unknown even to the most well connected Grambling supporters, earned the reputation as the Tigers’ best kickoff returner. \nThe shifty 5-foot-8 Carter racked up 770 yards for a 24.1 average as a freshman in 2014. His big impact play came against Alabama A&M when he returned a kick 92 yards for a touchdown to spark a 38-28 win. \n“Every time I touched the ball last year everybody in the stands was on their feet and they were trying to see what play I’d make,” Carter recalled. \nDuring a radio interview, Carter was referred to as “exciting” and “explosive,” which later led to Mr. Excitement. \nIt stuck. Grambling running back Martez Carter is known as Mr. Excitement on campus. He explains how he earned that nickname. \nA year later and Carter is holding true to his nickname. In Grambling’s first home game against Bethune-Cookman, Carter ripped off a 39-yard touchdown run, and sure enough, the public address announcer belted out “Mr. Excitement!” as the crowd went wild. \n“Once I get the ball, it’s like I just turn into a different person,” said Carter, who is coming off a 123-yard rushing performance. “I’m a different person, a different type of athlete and I just feel like I have to score.” \nThis year, Carter, who opened the year as the No. 2 running back, leads Grambling in rushing with 476 yards on just 61 carries for a whopping 7.8 yards per rush to go along with seven catches for 90 yards. In total, he has eight scores — four rushing, two receiving and two kickoff returns. He leads Grambling with 185.2 all-purpose yards per game and is second in the country in that category. \n“He’ll do some things from time to time, and I’m like ‘What are you doing?’ And then he’ll end up in the end zone,” Grambling coach Broderick Fobbs said. A tough upbringing Fending for himself from an early age \nDiscussing Carter in the present tense is usually all laughs and smiles. That quickly changes when learning where he came from. \n“I have yet to see one to excel the way he did given the circumstances he was in,” Davis said. “At any time he could have went the other way.” \nIt takes just a few moments when talking to Carter to understand he’s proud of his family’s namesake. In his eyes, the Carter family is known in Monroe and he’ll do anything in his power to keep it alive. \nEven if it means looking out for his best interest, something he’s had to do most of his life. \nCarter, 21, the son of Tina and Mike, is one of four brothers ranging from ages 25 to 9. \nIt was hardly a typical household, though. \nMonroe native Martez Carter struggled to see the field in 2014 but has quickly emerged as one of the Tigers' best offensive weapons.

She had four boys to feed. It was me and my older brother and he wasn’t the best role model in the world. He was in trouble a lot.” \nCarter’s brother has been in and out of prison along with his father, who has spent most of Carter’s life behind bars. Carter said his father is currently in a halfway house and “should be out in 2017.” \nThe two visit on occasion and talk on the phone, especially after games — his father keeps up with the press clippings and listens to every game on the radio. \n“That’s who I kind of play for today. I play for my family to be positive impacts on my life,” Carter said. “I don’t want to be ‘free my brother, free my father’ I want it to be ‘for my father and for my brother.’ \n“I’m not disappointed in him at all. I’m actually happy to have my dad in my life. It’s a wonderful feeling.” \nThe truth is Carter has had a void there most of his life. Now, Fobbs is the latest influence in his life. \n“My coach always became my father,” Carter said. Facing the real world at 14 Carter explains his 'rugged' life in Monroe \nSeven years ago, Carter had no one in his life, at least not a traditional place to call home. \nSince Carter’s mom was so busy, he had free reign to do whatever he pleased. \nCurfew wasn’t an issue, which led Carter to get into things “I wasn’t supposed to be doing. “He was homeless and we didn’t know he was homeless He had done that for months and we had never knew because he never led on what was really going on with him. That’s the type of kid we’re talking about. He was going to do whatever he needed to do even if he had to do it by himself.” Eric Davis, Richwood assistant principal \n“It was rugged,” he admitted. “Whatever I wanted to do, I did even if it was right or wrong. \n“When she was at home, it was all respect. When she wasn’t, I was just a kid no mother expects her child to be. That’s just what it was. I had one side for my mom and one side for the streets.” \nAt 14, things turned sour over clothes, of all things. Growing up without much at his disposal, Carter said he had a few shirts and a few pairs of pants he wore to junior high. \n“My mama figured if I had enough for a week then I could mix them up. She didn’t really feel like it was a big deal,” Carter recalled. “It got to a point where (students at school) would just make fun of me.” \nAn argument ensued and Carter moved out. Just like that, he was on his own. He moved down the street to a friend’s house who he now refers to as his godbrother. \nGrambling's Martez Carter (4) has eight touchdowns in the first four games for the Tigers, including four Saturday against Prairie View A&M. (Photo: Kelley L Cox, Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports) \nHe never went back, although Carter has since mended the relationship. \n“I love my mama. She’s always going to be my mama no matter how bad we fall off,” he said. “If my mama needs me I’m going to be there for her.” \nTo this day, Carter goes back to his godbrother’s house when he’s in Monroe but he’s still drifted at times. Just last year, he spent several nights at Fobbs’ house after his uncle was murdered. \nRegardless of the situation, Carter rarely let anyone in on his private life. Davis, who first met Carter at Richwood, wasn’t even initially aware of his plight. \n“He was homeless and we didn’t know he was homeless,” Davis said. “He had done that for months and we had never knew because he never led on what was really going on with him. That’s the type of kid we’re talking about. He was going to do whatever he needed to do even if he had to do it by himself.” That low on the totem pole From Atlanta to Texas to Grambling \nExcluding his upbringing, the fact that Carter is playing football at Grambling is just short of remarkable. \nFootball was always on the radar for Carter, it was just his grades didn’t always agree with him. \nAt Richwood, Carter played quarterback for the football team and guard for the basketball team. Carter even wowed observers in basketball, as Fobbs notes how he once saw a video of Carter doing a 360-dunk. \nThe highlight of his prep career came in 2012 when the Rams won the Class 3A state championship at Louisiana Tech. \n“He was an instant game changer on campus, during game he was an instant leader,” Davis said. “He was one people rallied behind and they all followed him. Whatever he did he went all in. He was their hero.” \nAgain, the high quickly turned to a low when Carter was academically ineligible for his senior season. He ended up moving to Georgia to attend the Atlanta Sports Academy, the same school that housed Deion Sanders Jr., but Carter’s stay lasted just a few weeks. \nGrambling football coach Broderick Fobbs, left, poses for a photo with running back Martez Carter, right. (Photo: SEAN ISABELLA/The News-Star) \nSeemingly in a bind, Davis and other Richwood administrators helped Carter re-enroll in school at Richwood. He went on to graduate in 2013, but poor grades led him in the direction of basketball, not football. \nCarter enrolled at Wiley College, an NAIA school in Texas, to play basketball before he literally walked into a golden opportunity at Grambling. \nFobbs and Davis, who are good friends, were at a Richwood basketball game that winter shortly after Fobbs was hired as Grambling’s new football coach. \nFobbs, who grew up in Monroe and went to Carroll High School, knew of Carter and asked Davis what he was up to. \n“He said he’s at Wiley playing basketball. When that came out of his mouth he was walking down the steps,” Fobbs recalled. \nA conversation ensued and Fobbs offered Carter a walk-on spot contingent on him improving his grades. \nThat summer, Carter got his GPA up enough to get into Grambling where he earned a camp invite as a walk-on defensive back. \n“He was that low on the totem poll,” Fobbs said. 'It's not a place I want to be' Carter discusses how a run-in with the law changed his outlook on life \nFootball almost never happened for Carter. \nDuring his junior year of high school, Carter was on his way to a track meet when he got arrested from an outstanding warrant he received for a gang related fight. \nCarter, who doubled as Richwood’s quarterback, ended up missing a football game because of the incident. \nThat’s when the light bulb went off. \n“It’s not a place I want to be. I don’t want nobody telling me to get up, go inside, lay down and eat. I like being free and doing good,” Carter said sternly, his voice sounding serious as ever. “I can’t do that behind no jail bars. Nobody is going to respect me when I go to jail.” Grambling coach Broderick Fobbs gives some perspective on why RB Martez Carter has exploded on to the scene in 2015. \nBetween football and basketball, the outgoing Carter spent most of his junior year in the spotlight. He learned how quickly things can change. \nWhile in jail, Carter called several people to pick him up. One by one, they said no. His coaches ended up coming to the rescue. \n“I was just talking to (people) yesterday and you said you were proud of me. Now I made a minor mistake and people will literally throw you away if you’re behind bars,” Carter said. “There’s nothing good that can come from that.” \nCarter was exposed to a gritty lifestyle early in his life. Between his brother, father and his cousin, Ladon Carter, who had a few hiccups along the way to being one of the top basketball players from Richwood, Carter should have known better. But think of it as trial by fire. He needed to experience it first-hand to truly wrap his mind around it. \n“I think he realized after all the success he had, you’re still responsible for everything you do,” Davis said. “Just the idea that everything could be taken away by a selfish decision was enough for him to wake up and say I can’t behave and act like this if I want to be someone and if I want to do something.” Scout team unknown to game changer 'I never expected these things out of myself' \nCarter’s rise to stardom at Grambling was hardly glamorous. \nHe served as a kickoff returner on the scout team until he gave the coaching staff a reason to get him on the field. \n“We kicked it off to him and he ran it back. We were fussing at the kickoff team. We kicked it to him again and he ran it back again,” Fobbs said smiling. “I’m fussing and then after two or three times I realized maybe it’s not them but maybe it’s him. \n“He kept pushing at me, nudging at me to play some offense. I never would let him play.” “Once I get the ball, it’s like I just turn into a different person. I’m a different person, a different type of athlete and I just feel like I have to score.” Martez Carter, Grambling RB \nCarter ended up returning 32 kicks in 2014 but notched just three offensive touches all while practicing as a defensive back. \nThen came spring practice last March. \nTo the surprise of Carter, he found a white offensive jersey in his locker. A closer look at the depth chart revealed he had moved to running back. \nEverything since then has been unexpected, including a four-touchdown effort in September against Prairie View A&M to earn both LSWA and FCS STATS Special Teams Player of the Week. \n“He’s a dynamic football player. He doesn’t always do things right but sometimes you have to live with a couple of the mistakes because he’s just learning how to play the position now,” said Fobbs, whose father, Lee, is a former Richwood assistant and now coaches the running backs at Grambling. \nAmazingly, he’s all done it on just 85 touches, meaning Carter averages 13 yards every time he has the ball in his hand and he’s averaging a touchdown every 10 touches. GSU's Carter earns 2 Player of the Week honors \n“I thought I’d be the kind of guy that would be a game changer. I didn’t think it would be this much of an impact,” Carter admitted. “I just knew I could help us here and there out of some tough situations. Last year, I kind of returned some kicks that got us out of some slumps. I didn’t think it would be as big as it is.” \nThe notion that Carter is actually in school is even more shocking to him. \nIn fact, Fobbs is more impressed with how Carter has bumped his GPA from a 2.1 to close to a 2.5 since he stepped foot on campus. \n“Honestly, I never expected to come to college. I never expected these things out of myself,” Carter said. “Seeing other people’s success, I wanted that so I had to change myself after high school being out in the real world in Atlanta. I had to want something better for myself. Coach Fobbs gave me that opportunity.” The red wagon Turning the most negative things into positives \nA lack of expectation comes from Carter’s humble beginnings. \nCarter’s grandmother was one of his bigger influences growing up. She had 11 children, so there were as many as 20 grandchildren running around her house in Monroe at any given time. \nOne day, Carter, who was 8 at the time, got hit by a car while chasing a ball in front of his grandmother’s house. The woman, who Carter estimates was going 20 or 30 miles an hour, struck Carter and dragged him under the car. \nCarter pointed to a large scar on his right lower leg, noting how his shin shifted and had to be put in place with his tibia and fibula broken. \nHe later had surgery, but there was one problem. \n“We couldn’t go to rehab. I couldn’t afford a wheelchair,” he said. “I couldn’t sit in a wheel chair because I had a body cast up to my chest.” \nSo what was the next best option? A red wagon. \nGrambling running back Martez Carter played basketball and football for Richwood. (Photo: MARGARET CROFT/THE NEWS-STAR, MARGARET CROFT/THE NEWS-STAR) \nWhenever Carter needed to get around, he’d jump in his red wagon. Sometimes, he’d flip the handle back and pretend he was driving a racecar. \n“I would get to control it and we was off to the races,” Carter joked. \n“I just take the most negative things and turn it into a positive because that’s the type of kid I was. I had an upbeat personality.” \nCarter would end up making a full recovery. Then more adversity came. \nAs if his family situation wasn’t murky enough, he lost the glue of the Carter family in 2009 when his grandmother passed away. \n“It took my family apart. We kind of lost who we were as Carter’s. We kind of just were cut off from society,” Carter said. “My mama wasn’t talking to anybody in the family and it was hard. That’s when I was just on the uprising of my career and I lost all support from my family.” \nWhether it was dunks on the court or touchdowns on the field, Carter never had the best cheer section. That always seemed odd to Davis, but he never heard Carter complain. \n“He didn’t always have the best things. He didn’t always have super parental support,” Davis said. “He never led on to those things. He was a private person when it came to that. He overachieved.” 'I fell in love with them' Tattoos symbolize Carter's life in pictures and words \nMost of the public knows Carter in a Grambling uniform. The person behind the gear is a better indication of how he carries himself. \nCarter has enough ink on his body to start his own tattoo shop, more than 100 tattoos actually, according to his rough estimate. \nFirst, he points to initials that spell out his siblings. He even has a spot for his God brother “because he means just as much to me as anybody else do.” \nThen there’s ink on his left shoulder of Richwood’s state championship season from 2012 and one that reads “Carter Est. 1993” across his stomach. \n“I took off with them,” he said. “I fell in love with them.” \nThere’s two that stand out, though. \nHis first few tattoos came when he was 15 via a pair of four-letter words on either hand. On the right, Tina is spelled out. On his left hand, a spot for Mike is there for him to view daily. \nCollectively, they serve as a reminder of his past and where he’s at today. It paints another picture just like the one he vividly can see in the sky during games. \nMartez Carter estimates that he has more than 100 tattoos on his body, several of which carry special meaning. (Photo: SEAN ISABELLA/The News-Star) \n“I take the pats on the back and the congratulations and all that,” Carter said of his newfound success. “I take that and I don’t run with it but I use it. I like to be acknowledged. I’m handling it really well.” \nCarter will turn 22 soon, but he’s still “young” from a football perspective. \nAnd that’s the scary part, especially for opposing coaches who have yet to figure out how to stop Carter. \n“He’s still learning the game of football. He’s more receptive this year than he was last year,” Grambling wide receivers coach Mickey Joseph said. “Last year, he wanted to play on straight athletic ability. This year, he’s being more of a football player. He’s getting there. He’s special.” \nSpecial is a word used often when describing Carter, and not just for his athletic ability. There’s just something about him that makes people root for him. \nThe touchdowns will continue to come as will the notoriety. Carter won’t change, though, and he certainly won’t dismiss his past. \nHe’s accepted it. He’s embraced it. \n“I’m proud of myself from where I came from. The old me wouldn’t be here doing this interview,” Carter said. “I would be out there doing something I had no business doing. Every day I wake up I really thank God for opening my eyes.” Share This Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:34:44.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
