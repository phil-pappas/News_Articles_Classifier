They have remained friends ever since, but neither was willing to provide any good stories about the other when asked. \nThey did discuss each other's strengths as a coach. \n\"He does a great job of pressuring the football, whether it's the running game or the pass game,\" said Lewis. \"“He’s sharp as hell. In Baltimore, we were never short of ideas. He really did a good job.\" \nRyan said he admired the way Lewis allowed the position coaches under him to consistently share ideas about how to stop opponents. \n\"No matter how different your style might have been to his every coach under him felt you were a major contributor,\" said Ryan. \"I think that's a great thing. That's what I've always tried to do since my time with Marvin. He knew he had some talented guys with him (on the coaching staff) and the great thing with Marvin, he'd say, 'What do you think about this?,' and you'd throw it out there and you never felt bad. If it got shot down it go shot down. Whether it got shot down or not you felt great about it, because Marvin would listen to things. I was blessed and very fortunate to be under him for those three years I was with him. Marvin had a big influence on me. Marvin is a great football coach, he's an intense football coach and passionate and do your job - alignment, assignment and technique. I took away all those things from him. He is such a great person and a caring person. That's what I know most about Marvin.\" \nWhile there were no juicy stories told about the other, both did quip about Ryan's penchant for always finding his golf ball no matter how wayward it may go during a round. \n\"Back in the day we were both horrible, but we were a tough team to beat, because we had a tendency to find my ball about 300 yards away from the tee box,\" said Ryan. \"I would crush it, unfortunately I never know where it was going, but I would definitely find my golf ball.\" \nSaid Lewis: \"When we got to coach together, you enjoy each and every day, and since then our friendship has gotten closer. We handle some situations a little differently. Unfortunately, sometimes people take what he says the wrong way. He’s a good person and a fun person. He’s so genuine, which is cool. We just had a lot of fun. I enjoy seeing him when we get together.\" \nRYAN SAYS GREEN BEST IN AFC: Ryan said he believes Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green is the best in the AFC at his position. \n\"He's big, he's physical, he's fast,\" said Ryan. \"He can catch any route. He'll go over the middle. He'll go deep. You know he's going deep and he still catches it. A lot of people roll their coverage to him and it doesn't matter they stlll throw it to him. Obviously he's a rare talent. I remember when he was a rookie and the first time playing him in the preseason, I'm like, 'Ah let's just go ahead and D him up (man-to-man). Whoops, not so fast. He's been at the highest level for a long, long time.\" \nIn that game Ryan referenced on Aug. 21, 2011, Green only had one reception for eight yards. \nRYAN WON'T FORGET 2013 GAME AGAINST BENGALS: Ryan remembered very well about the last time he coached a team that faced the Bengals, which came when his New York Jets visited Cincinnati on Oct. 27, 2013 in week eight of the season and lost 49-9. \n\"I got my ass kicked,\" said Ryan. \"It was ugly and it got ugly in a hurry. I mentioned it to my team (Wednesday) that it was an ass whipping, and if you're not on top of your game this team can embarrass you.\" \nThe Bengals led 28-6 at halftime behind four first-half touchdown passes by Andy Dalton, three that went to Marvin Jones, then got two interception returns for touchdowns in the second half, one by Chris Crocker and the other by Adam Jones. Dalton threw his fifth TD pass of the game in the second half, also to Jones. The four touchdown receptions by Jones is a single-game franchise record, while Dalton's five TD passes is tied for the second most in a game in franchise history. \nRYAN LOVES CINCINNATI NATIVE: When Ryan became the Bills head coach this season he had an idea that linebacker Preston Brown was a good player, but he has a whole new level of appreciation for the Northwest High School graduate since watching him up close. \n\"He's outstanding,\" said Ryan. \"He's not just a good player, he has a chance to be an outstanding middle linebacker in this league. His dad (Mike) was a (high school) coach and it shows. He's a smart player and he's physical and he's done a really nice job here.\" \nBrown, who was taken in the third round of the 2014 NFL Draft out of Louisville, played a lot at outside linebacker last season on the tight end side of the field and a little at middle linebacker before moving to the middle full time this season. \nHe ranks 10th in the NFL this season in tackles (41), is fifth among linebackers in passes defended (three), has two interceptions (one he returned for a touchdown), one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. \nLast season, he ranked second among all rookies in tackles with 108. \nPhoto: AP Photo Gary Weipert \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
