Over the years, I have followed Tom’s leadership as both councilman and mayor. His concern and work to manage our growth has been and is his biggest priority. With Tom on the council and as our mayor, Sammamish continues to be a safe, desirable, family-oriented community. \nTom is a true environmentalist. He was among the first this year to be endorsed by Washington Conservation Voters — not the first time he has been endorsed by that organization. His leadership on the tree-retention policy and his goal of “no net loss of trees” is coupled with his goal of increasing our tree canopy with our new urban forestry initiative is exactly what we need. And Tom was a leader in the effort to protect our sensitive wetlands and open space over the past four years. \nTom’s work with Issaquah leadership on the Klahanie annexation made it possible for Sammamish to improve our southern commutes. A rebuilt Issaquah-Fall City Road will help commutes on the other southern commuter routes. Now Tom is eager to work with King County, Redmond and the department of transportation to improve Sahalee Way and commutes all the way to SR 520. \nI know that Tom is very proud that one of his particular goals, the building of a new community and aquatic center, is actually happening during his time as mayor. \nI am struck by Tom’s genuineness, resourcefulness and respect for people, especially when their opinions might differ from his own. His ability to work across city boundaries is well-known. This all speaks to his grounded sense of self and his wide understanding of the issues that impact our community. \nTom Vance has served the city of Sammamish well over the past four years. \nI cannot imagine any other outcome than Tom remaining a reassuring and reliable presence in the Sammamish City Council. \nMichele Bartel \nSammamish \n\nWritten by Contributed · Filed Under Letters to the Editor \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:11:51.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
