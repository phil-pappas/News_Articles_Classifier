But others, like pensioner Goran, said the protest was \"not about NATO or Russia, but about poor life.\"\n\"Milo Djukanovic has robbed us, there are no jobs, he destroyed this country,\" Goran told AFP.\nNebojsa Medojevic of the Democratic Front, the main opposition bloc, said that \"Montenegro has been destroyed by corruption, crime and the dictatorship of one person\".\nSeveral hundred anti-riot officers were around the parliament in downtown Podgorica.\nA week ago police used tear gas to disperse several hundred opposition activists trying to protest outside parliament despite a protest ban. And on Sunday, protesters hurled stones and used pepper spray against police, who retaliated with tear gas.\nDjukanovic, 53, won re-election as premier in 2012, marking the third time he has held the post since Montenegro gained independence from neighbouring Serbia in 2006.\nHe has been at the centre of power since 1990, and was president of Montenegro between 1998 and 2002.\nThe next parliamentary polls in the country -- which has a population of around 630,000 -- are due early next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:32:26.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
