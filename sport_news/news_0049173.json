The value of the shares given to the electricity sector workers won't be calculated until the IPO proceeds.\nThe prospectus states Hydro One, which owns and operates 29,000 kilometres of high-voltage transmission lines and is a local electricity distributor for about 1.2 million customers, has $23 billion in assets and revenues over $6 billion in 2014.\nRelated Stories Ont. municipalities line up to oppose Hydro One sale Hydro One takes step toward sale by filing paperwork for initial public offering", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:55:01.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
