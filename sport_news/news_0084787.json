Hosley already has given the Giants some solid performances.\nWhen Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie suffered a concussion Week 2 against the Falcons, Hosley entered the game and finished with eight tackles.\nThen he started the following week against the Redskins and registered a tackle in the Giants’ 32-21 win.\n\"It’s something to build off of,\" Hosley said. \"I think my play was good. It’s time to be great now.\"\nStill, losing Amukamara hurts a defense that’s allowing an average of 304 passing yards per game. The 2011 first-round pick has 32 tackles (26 solo) and an interception.\nAmukamara suffered the injury in the third quarter while making a tackle, and he said it especially bothered him when he ran. But when trainers told him the tendon was still attached to the bone, he felt confident reentering the game.\n\"We were pressing a lot that game, so since I was able to still press, I felt like I could still go out there and still got the job done,\" Amukamara said.\nBut the 26-year-old said he isn’t too concerned that this will turn into a larger issue.\n\"I can still do stuff with it so that gives me encouragement,\" Amukamara said. \"When it starts to get to the second and third week, and if I’m still at this stage, then I’ll probably start panicking a little bit.\"\nAmukamara’s injury comes at a bad time since he heads into free agency after the season, though he said that isn’t something he’s worrying about right now.\nYet he still couldn’t shake the frustration of suffering another injury.\nHe missed eight games last year because of a torn biceps, and has only played one full season in his five-year career.\n\"I try different things,\" Amukamara said. \"I tried switching my eating habits, my workout habits. So I’m still just going to continue to just try to figure it out.\"\nThe Giants are going into their Monday night game in Philadelphia somewhat thin at cornerback.\nAside from Hosley and Rodgers-Cromartie, the only other cornerbacks on the roster are Trumaine McBride and Trevin Wade.\nMcBride has been bothered by a groin injury, and was a limited participant in Thursday’s practice.\nThe Giants did sign Brandon McGee to their practice squad Thursday, potentially giving them another option.\nAmukamara’s injury is one of many the Giants are dealing with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:03.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
