He'll take aim at Alabama's defense this weekend at College Station's Kyle Field. Joseph Goodman | jgoodman@al.com \nLeading off Thursday morning's AL.com All-Access live chat with some doubts about Alabama ... \nTwo games this weekend should give us a clearer picture of just how the SEC might impact the national race. \nGo ahead and put one-loss Alabama on upset alert before its away game even begins against Texas A&M. Another slow start for Lane Kiffin and his offense could doom Alabama on the road. Alabama is 2-0 in College Station, Texas, but if the Crimson Tide falls behind early, a second half rally in Kyle Field might be too much to ask of quarterback Jake Coker. \nAlabama linebacker Reggie Ragland is developing into one of the best players in college football, and he'll be a key asset against Texas A&M's misdirection. The Aggies, which had a bye week to prepare for Alabama, haven't turned the ball over since the third week of the season. Quarterback Kyle Allen has already thrown for 13 touchdowns this season, but it's his mobility that could be the difference in an evenly matched game. \nFeeling as confident about Alabama's chances against Texas A&M as me? \nThe other important SEC match-up holds more national appeal, and just in time for Leonard Fournette's biggest game, the editors at Sports Illustrated decided to give the LSU running back the first cover of his career. \nNothing has been able to stop Fournette, though, so an SI cover jinx might pass over Baton Rouge, La., this weekend. \nThe key question, obviously, is whether or not the Gators' rushing defense, which is allowing just 3.05 yards per carry (and 99.60 yards per game), can limit Fournette and force quarterback Brandon Harris into some difficult situations. \nFournette is getting all the headlines, but it's Harris who has always been the difference between LSU being a national contender, and just another team featuring a very special player. \nJOE VS THE PRO \nSomething unprecedented is happening with Joe vs. the Pro, the weekly picks feature that puts me, an average Joe, up against a professional handicapper and numbers man. For the first time in the six-year history of the experiment, I'm actually winning. \nShockingly, I went 8-0 straight up last week and, more importantly, 6-2 against the spread. Picking winners straight up is fun, but that's not the real game here. It's all about the spread. For the season, I'm 24-16 straight up and a stunning 25-13-2 against the spread. \nHistorically, the Pro, Lee Sterling of ParamountSports.com , is the unquestioned king of the picks. This week he'll be looking to get back in the race, and end Joe's time in the sun. The Pro went 7-1 straight up last week, and 4-4 against the spread. For the season, the Pro is 23-17 straight up and 15-23-2 against the spread. Onto the picks! \nAuburn at Kentucky, Auburn by 2.5 \nJoe: Auburn fans are dreading this game, but I don't think the Tigers are ready to fold tent on this season just yet. Auburn 27, Kentucky 24 \nPro: Cats QB Patrick Towles much better than anything the Tigers roll out at QB. Kentucky also takes care of the ball, which is important with middle-of-the-road teams looking for one break to win what should be a close game. Kentucky 30, Auburn 24 \nLouisiana Tech at Mississippi State, Mississippi State by 13.5 \nJoe: La. Tech quarterback Jeff Driskel won't be intimidated by Hail State. He has the talent to keep it close if he can limit his interceptions. Mississippi State 42, Louisiana Tech 35 \nPro: The Bulldogs are looking for that signature win after falling in three overtimes to Kansas State. Rejuvenated QB Jeff Driskel and RB Kenneth Dixon are a nice one-two punch that may not go away. Mississippi State 35, Louisiana Tech 28 \nAlabama at Texas A&M, Alabama by 4 \nJoe: Big plays and turnovers bailed out Alabama in the second half against Arkansas. Kyle Field won't be so kind. Texas A&M 33, Alabama 28 \nPro: The way to beat Bama was drawn up by Ole Miss QB Chad Kelly a couple of weeks ago. Aggie QB Kyle Allen has the makeup and weapons around him to be that guy also. Texas A&M 31, Alabama 30 \nFlorida at LSU, LSU by 9.5 \nJoe: Gators rushing defense keeps it close despite a new starting quarterback. LSU 25, Florida 20 \nPro: Tough spot here for Gators as they travel for a second week in a row. Tigers have been home three of the last four weeks. If Gators fall behind, I doubt QB Treon Harris is the guy that can rally the troops. LSU 28, Florida 13 \nMissouri at Georgia, Georgia by 16 \nJoe: Missouri's defense isn't far behind the Gators' fearsome unit. Tigers' offense on the road inspires no confidence, though. Georgia 28, Missouri 15 \nPro: The Tiger 'D' hasn't allowed more than 120 rushing yards in any game this season, and that's the only way the Bulldogs like to roll. This line is way off. Georgia 24, Missouri 17 \nMichigan State at Michigan, Michigan by 8.5 \nJoe: Easy to see why this line is so big. No one can score on the Wolverines. Another eye-opening blowout! Michigan 42, Michigan State 20 \nPro: Except for the opening game against Utah, the Wolverines have caught every opponent at the right time. This is a rivalry game, and if the talent is about the same it usually comes down to the wire. Michigan 27, Michigan State 23 \nVanderbilt at South Carolina, South Carolina by 2.5 \nJoe: Spurrier gave up on his team, but at least he did it on Vanderbilt week. South Carolina 28, Vanderbilt 25 \nPro: The best unit on both teams is the Vanderbilt defense. They have held every opponent to their season low in points and total yards. They won't have trouble with the Gamecocks who lack a decent QB. Vanderbilt 23, South Carolina 17 \nOle Miss at Memphis, Ole Miss by 10.5 \nJoe: Memphis is well-coached and leads the American Athletic Conference in scoring with an average of 47.8 points per game. Calling for the upset in this rivalry game. Memphis 38, Ole Miss 35 \nPro: Tigers' offense drops 40 to 55 points on non-power five conference teams with regularity. They face an angry Ole Miss team that is itching to impress voters with blowout wins to get back into the National Championship hunt. Mississippi 45, Memphis 24 \nAs a reminder, AL.com All-Access promotes the expression of creative thought in the comments section, and head carni Joseph Goodman withholds the right to condemn anyone for taking things too seriously. Joe runs the All-Access live chat every Thursday, and he's around throughout the day beginning at 10 a.m CT. (But mostly from just 10 to 11 a.m.) Ask him a question and he might answer if he can keep up with the comments (he's kinda slow).
