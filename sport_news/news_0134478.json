Two decisions have cost us a game in which we were totally dominant, looked a very good side, frustrated the crowd - it was a perfect performance in the first half.\" \nNewcastle went into first-half stoppage time having bossed the game, but crucially without having made it tell, and they were stung in devastating style twice within seconds. \nMidfielder Georginio Wijnaldum was left appealing in vain for a penalty after Lee Cattermole appeared to handle the ball inside the box and then haul him to the ground with referee Madley unmoved. \nHowever, he had no hesitation in pointing to the spot at the other end seconds later after Coloccini leaned rather too heavily on Steven Fletcher as he tried to shepherd the ball back to goalkeeper Rob Elliot, rubbing salt into the wound by also producing a red card. \nMcClaren said: \"It's simple: he is wrong in my opinion. Referees are part and parcel of the game and you control your performance - you can't control the opponent or the referee and they can affect the result. And they have done today - not so much the opponent, but definitely the referee. \n\"I have seen lots of challenges like that in the game, in every game and, outside the box, they are never given. It's a double whammy - a penalty and 10 men. It made it very difficult. \n\"We need an experienced referee for this and I think in both instances, he was a little too quick to make a decision.\" \nAdam Johnson dispatched the penalty with the minimum of fuss to set up a second half in which Billy Jones and Fletcher added two more to wrap up the win. \nAllardyce became the fourth straight Sunderland boss after Paolo di Canio, Gus Poyet and Dick Advocaat to bounce back from defeat in his first game in charge by beating Newcastle in his second, and he could hardly have been more delighted. \nThe 61-year-old said: \"We have taken full advantage of a piece of good fortune. I did think it was a foul, personally. \n\"I have had a look at it and I think if he hadn't have made contact with him, Steven Fletcher would have scored on his left foot, on his better side. \n\"It's a bit harsh, sending him off, though, but that's the rule, sadly, and we have taken full advantage of that today. \n\"We got a harsh decision last week against us; we've got one that perhaps has gone for us this time. But the big thing is that we have taken advantage of it. \n\"When the Sunderland fans wake up tomorrow, they won't be worried about that, will they? Because we have won and we have kept the record going. \n\"Six wins on the trot, the fourth manager to be in charge of the club on his second game and beat our local rivals - I find that a bizarre statistic, but it's very nice to have kept it going.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:25:10.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
