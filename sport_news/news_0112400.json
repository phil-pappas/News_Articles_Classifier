Trying to sweep, the \nEngland skipper only found air as he lunged forward and Zulfiqar's ball struck his pad low. \nPakistan called for a review but Hawk-Eye indicated the ball would have missed leg-stump. \nZulfiqar was again cursing his luck when Cook, on 149, skied a sweep to Fawad Alam at backward square, but the stooping substitute fielder fumbled the catch. \nThe sweltering heat led Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq to rotate his attack. Six bowlers were used in the morning session alone, although Zulfiqar (36 overs) carried the main burden as sole frontline spinner following Yasir Shah's late injury. \nZulfiqar's figures were 0-67 from 38 overs, Misbah seemingly content to slow England's scoring. No wickets have fallen to spinners this test. \nBell registered his 46th test half-century by dispatching Rahat Ali's short delivery for four, a rare moment of swagger from a veteran who has endured a difficult 2015. \nHis innings ended with a shanked drive into Mohammad Hafeez's grateful hands at backward point, while Mark Wood (4) lasted only seven balls before playing on. \nThe three-match series heads to Dubai next for the second test from Oct. 22 with Sharjah hosting the third contest from Nov. 1. \n(Editing by Peter Rutherford/John O'Brien/Martyn Herman) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
