He says the money was unpaid additional salary from his job as Blatter's adviser between 1998 and 2002. \nThe FA says it received \"more information\" on the case from Platini's lawyer at Thursday's UEFA meeting. \nAs a result, the FA board decided Friday that \"it must suspend its support\" of Platini's candidacy.
