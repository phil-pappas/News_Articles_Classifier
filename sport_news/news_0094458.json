His Test CV includes only three matches, all on foreign soil.\nMaxwell sometimes feels he’s fighting a battle about how he’s perceived by coaches and selectors at Cricket Australia and by the media and general public.\n“If you look at some of the innings I’ve played in the one-day format where I’ve got us out of a hole or batted well in the middle order and got us deep into the game, that has held me in better stead for my Test stuff,” Maxwell told the Herald Sun on Monday.\nMaxwell points to his 85 in a one-dayer against England last month, after coming in at 3-30, as an example his ability to shift gears.\n“They have seen the technique side. It can survive at the top level,” Maxwell said.\n“When the top order gets skittled and I’m there to pick up the pieces with George Bailey, it was a bit more calm aggression than what they’ve seen when I’ve batted at the back end.\n“That perception, sure, I’ve had to deal with that for the whole way through.\n“If the situation called for me going berserk from ball one I did it, sometimes to the detriment of my own perception.\n“I’ve always tried to do what was right for the team. Unfortunately now I’ve got to fight back from that and change the way I’m perceived in the media and by the coaches as well.”\nThe spin-bowling allrounder was picked in Australia’s 15-man squad for this month’s tour of Bangladesh which was postponed last week for security reasons.\nThe Matador Cup one-day tournament in Sydney now presents itself as another device to help catapult the audacious hitter back into the baggy green.\n“Hopefully my performances in this Matador Cup can help show them that I’m ready to make that step up to play Tests in our home summer against New Zealand and West Indies,” said Maxwell, 26.\n“It would be nice to play a few Tests at home and really show them what I’m made of.”\nMaxwell’s last Test was in Abu Dhabi against Pakistan in 2014. His first-innings knock of 37 off 28 balls at No.4 ended with a charge down the wicket and the loss of his off stump.\nPromoted to No.3 and told to be aggressive, he was out LBW for four. But he’s determined to push on with his aggressive strokeplay.\n“When people talk about the reverse sweep in Test-match cricket, I’ve seen players play it repeatedly,” Maxwell said.\n“Unfortunately if I miss it I get nailed. That seems to be the way it goes.”\nMaxwell cracked 98 off 63 balls in a warm-up game on Sunday.\n“I’m hitting the ball beautifully,” he said.\nGLENN MAXWELL’S TEST RECORD\nMATCHES: 3\nRUNS: 80 at 13.33\nWICKETS: 7 at 38.71\n Maxwell ready to express Test credentials", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/cricket/glenn-maxwell-keen-to-push-his-test-credentials/story-fni2usfi-1227558110354"], "published": "2015-10-06T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:09.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
