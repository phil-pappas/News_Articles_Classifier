This is very nice, I am very happy for this but I want also for another generation that can ride to be here.\n\"I was motivated from the problem in Europe. I told Kate my girlfriend if I win the rainbow jersey I want to tell this so people are thinking about the future and that we have to change something.\"\nOne man alone may not be able to change the world but Sagan proved one man going alone can win a world championship after he had boldly embarked on a solo attack with three kilometres remaining in the 261km marathon.\nTiming his move to perfection, the Slovakian had just enough left in his tank to fend off a hard-charging peloton and claim a three-second victory over Australian Michael Matthews.\n\"From the last climb, it was still a long way until the finish,\" said Sagan. \"The climb was very hard, the climb was very short but the last 800 metres was very tough.\n\"If you go alone from that moment until the finish, it was far away and when you see the group behind you know everybody will go full gas to hunt you.\n\"But I said I have to go because if I go back and wait for the sprint, I can do second, third, four, fifth but when I decided to go alone it was the best moment.\"\nOne of most popular and charismatic riders in the peloton, Sagan's skills and personality are both diverse and complete.\nTAILOR-MADE COURSE\nA rider with decent sprinting qualities added to a capacity to master short and brutal ascents, the Richmond course with its sharp punchy climbs, including two up cobblestones, was tailor made for him.\nSagan also possesses a playful and engaging personality but he has demonstrated that he cares much more than simply getting to the top of podium.\nHis results, however, have not always matched his winning personality.\nSagan has managed eight top-10s in the Monument Classics, but had never won despite being the pre-race favourite several times.\nHe has won four successive Tour de France green jerseys and as many stage wins, yet this year he finished second on five occasions.\nWhile the Slovakian showed his serious side on Sunday, he was not going to let the biggest win of his career go by without a proper party.\n\"I live for the moment,\" declared Sagan when asked about his next goal. \"I have no time for this.\n\"I don't want to think about next year. I want to go out from this here and celebrate.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-28T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:30:39.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
