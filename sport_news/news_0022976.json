His final scoring strike, with 21 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, should have been enough to seal the win. But the defense couldn't hold the three-point edge and the game went into overtime. \nStafford also showed some surprising mobility, chipping in a pair of first-down runs. He gets knocked for a terrible interception on a ill-advised flip to running back Theo Riddick that the Bears converted into seven points, as well as a bad intentional grounding in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter that could have been far more costly. \nRUNNING BACKS: B+ Ameer Abdullah had a strong rushing performance in the first half, gaining 47 yards on 11 carries. He went to the bench after a third-quarter fumble, which he recovered, but suffered a stinger on the play. \nTheo Riddick added 28 yards on the ground and 50 as a receiver out of the backfield. His 34-yard catch and run sparked Detroit's go-ahead drive late in the fourth quarter. \nUndrafted rookie Zach Zenner had a strong start, but was knocked from the game early with a chest injury. \nWIDE RECEIVERS: A- Calvin Johnson finally unleashed his Megatron persona, catching six passes for 166 yards. He hauled in a 57-yard bomb to set up the game-winning field goal. \nGolden Tate chipped in six grabs for 40 yards and a touchdown, and nearly had a second. But the 22-yard would-be score was wiped out by a pass interference call against Johnson. \nThe real surprise was the contributions of Lance Moore, who had more than 100 yards receiving for the first time since 2012. He had three explosive plays in the game, including a 20-yard touchdown in the first quarter. \nTIGHT ENDS: B+ Tim Wright was the only tight end active for the Lions and he showed well, catching three passes for 17 yards and a touchdown. He also threw a key block on the Lions' successful punt fake in the fourth quarter. \nOFFENSIVE LINE: B Stafford faced some pressure at times, but often had a clean pocket and plenty of time to take downfield shots. The ability to utilize more of the vertical elements of the passing game can partially be attributed to the team's success running the football. Detroit's backs averaged a more-efficient-than-usual 3.6 yards per attempt. \nDEFENSIVE LINE: C+ The Lions did an effective job limiting Chicago running back Matt Forte, holding one of the NFL's most productive weapons to just 69 yards on 24 carries. \nOn the pass rush, Detroit did a decent job moving Jay Cutler off his spot. But the Lions didn't finish plays often enough, allowing the quarterback to stay upright and deliver some devastating downfield blows. \nDespite a favorable matchup, defensive tackle Ezekiel Ansah was held without a tackle. \nLINEBACKERS: B+ Josh Bynes continues to do a stellar job filling in for DeAndre Levy. The weakside backer recorded 11 stops, including a pair for a loss, and had a key pass breakup in the end zone. His only knock was a holding call, also in the end zone, that extended a Bears drive that ended in a touchdown. \nTahir Whitehead also had a key pass breakup in the end zone, which helped limit Chicago to a field goal. Stephen Tulloch, who has been up and down this season, was all over the field and came up with 13 total tackles. \nDEFENSIVE BACKS: D Simply put, the group gave up too many big plays, allowing Cutler to complete 26 of his 41 throws for 353 yards. The Chicago quarterback had completions of 30, 45 and 46 yards. \nBut the worst part of the group's performance was allowing the Bears to drive 69 yards on three plays with 21 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Josh Wilson got beat twice by Alshon Jeffery, then Darius Slay got flagged for pass interference on the series, setting up Robbie Gould with a chip shot to send the contest into overtime. \nSPECIAL TEAMS: D+ It's tough to be so hard on special teams when kicker Matt Prater made all three field goals, Sam Martin was brilliant punting the ball and Isa Abdul-Quddus perfectly executing a crucial fake punt in the fourth quarter. \nBut it's impossible to look past the two turnovers on punts, one a muff by TJ Jones and another when gunner Corey Fuller kicked the loose ball with his foot. Chicago converted those mistakes into 10 points. \nCOACHING: B The Lions offensive game plan was sharp and people are going to ask how much it had to do with coordinator Joe Lombardi's move from the sidelines up to the box. The attack was balanced and aggressive, taking advantage of all the team's weapons. \nThe defensive game plan was less sound. The Bears were able to pick apart Detroit's secondary on both short pick plays and deep shots when the coverage broke down on broken plays. \nJim Caldwell's decision to kick a field goal when down seven points and under three minutes remaining was questionable, but proved to be the right call when the defense forced a quick three-and-out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:12:24.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
