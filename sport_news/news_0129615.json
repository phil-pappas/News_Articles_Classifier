The right-hander's strikeouts tied the franchise playoff record set by Tom Seaver in Game 1 of the 1973 NL Championship Series.\nKershaw (0-1) endured his fifth straight postseason loss after giving up the seventh playoff homer of his career. Last season's NL MVP and Cy Young Award winner allowed three runs and four hits in 6 2-3 innings, struck out 11 and walked four.\nRuns will likely again be at a premium when the Dodgers try to even the series Saturday night in Game 2. They start major league ERA leader Zack Greinke against Noah Syndergaard.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
