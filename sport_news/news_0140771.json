Austin to a 1-1 tie Friday night at the Bill Stephens Complex. \nThe Ladyjacks (5-6-2, 4-0-2) scored early in the second half but the Bears (6-7-1, 3-2-1) evened it in the 88th minute when Stacia Carroll launched the ball from midfield and SFA keeper Lillie Ehlert misplayed it and it bounced over her head into the goal. \n“It’s interesting, because both goals tonight were not really great plays,” said Central Arkansas head coach Jeremy Bishop. “As good as the match tonight was, they weren’t necessarily very good soccer plays. But Stacia does a good job of putting the ball into dangerous positons on her crosses, and on a night like tonight, when the ball is skipping a bit, you get lucky” In net for the Bears, Anna Hughes made a career-high 13 saves.
