With less than one minute remaining in regulation, Florida Tech rallied for two goals, the final coming with three seconds on the clock, to complete a hectic comeback and tie Florida Southern 2-2 in double overtime. \n“Give the boys credit for their committed effort,” said head coach Robin Chan. “They stayed together until the very end. There’s still plenty of areas to improve upon, but we can take a lot of positives from tonight.” \nThe Panthers appeared headed for their fifth loss in six games, but as the fans headed toward the exits they were quickly forced back into their seats when Nicolas Dreyer lofted a pass into the box that was then headed by Stian Tsesmetsis into the back of the net, cutting the deficit to 2-1. Florida Tech raced the ball back to midfield and soon found itself threatening again, only this time it was Trey Collins finding Adin Kavara for his sixth goal of the season, sending the crowd into an uproar.

The spirit and committed energy there was good, we just have to continue to bring that sort of energy for 90 minutes.” \nThe Panthers continued to be on the attack in the early moments of the first overtime period. \nLeading the charge, Collins beat a Moccasin defender and fired a low shot from the edge of the 18-yard box. The ball was saved, but skated away from Florida Southern goalkeeper Cole Clingerman and into the lap of Kavara. From there the junior drilled the rebound into the dead center of the net for what looked to be the game-winner, only to have it wiped off the board on an offside call by the linesman. \nFor the fourth consecutive match, Florida Tech shrugged off a slow start to dominate play in the second half. The Panthers outshot Florida Southern 15-3 following halftime after losing the battle 7-4 in the opening 45 minutes. \n“Florida Southern has had some big wins and came in with a lot of momentum,” Chan added. “We obviously dug ourselves a big hole in the first half, but we kept playing, which is important.” \nFIT will look to carry its late-game momentum over to Wednesday in a rare non-conference matchup with Eckerd. Kickoff at Rick Stottler Field is slated for 7 p.m. The Panthers and Tritons played to a 1-1 draw in their first meeting this season on Sept. 19.
