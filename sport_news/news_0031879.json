Cozens on October 23,   \nAfter winning three grueling matches the previous two days, Anya Ivenitsky had little left in the tank in Thursday’s Section 1 girls tennis singles championship match. \nSo while John Jay senior’s loss in straight sets to Sydney Kaplan of Suffern was disappointing, it was understandable. \nKaplan played a near flawless match to win the section title, 6-2, 6-0, at Harrison High School. The first set was tied 2-2 after four games, and then Kaplan swept the final 10 games. \nIvenitsky, the first John Jay girls tennis player to ever reach the section finals, had won all three of her previous matches in the tourney in three sets, including a two-and-a-half hour match the day before against Courtney Ollis of Suffern in the semifinals. She had played 84 games, including a 12-point tiebreaker, in two days. \n“I’ve never played that much. I was pretty tired. It’s been a long week,” she said after Thursday’s loss. “It was a tough match. She didn’t make any errors. She played a really good match. I just didn’t have enough energy.” \n“Obviously you want to come out and play your best tennis and unfortunately she wasn’t able to do that today,” said John Jay Coach Mike Racanelli. “I wasn’t sure how her legs were going to feel coming into it. She kind of let me know towards the end, ‘I just don’t have the energy’. That’s not to take anything away from Sydney Kaplan, because she played a great match and she didn’t miss too many balls, and unfortunately today we couldn’t keep up with that.” \nThursday’s loss hardly diminished Ivenitsky’s accomplishment this week. She won a tough first-round match against Ashley Granieri of Scarsdale, 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, that Racanelli called a “heavyweight match” on Tuesday, and later that day rallied from a set down to beat the number-two seed, Maya Tezuka of Keio Academy, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2. \nIn the semifinals, she suffered a tough 7-6 loss in the first set, with Ollis taking the tiebreaker 7-5, but came back to win the second and third sets by scores of 6-3, 6-3. \nThat win not only put her in the finals, but earned her a spot in the state tournament. \n“That was my goal, to make it this far, to states. So I’m just really content,” Ivenitsky said. “The last two days, my last three matches, I think I played the most intense I’ve ever played.” \nAsked how it felt to be the first John Jay girls player to reach the section finals, she replied, “Amazing. It’s really, really cool.” \n“I saw Anya play some of the best tennis I’ve seen her play,” Racanelli said of the section tournament. \nIvenitsky and Racanelli both expect to see her bounce back for the state tournament, which will be held Oct. 31-Nov. 2 at Tri-City Fitness in Latham. She will be only the second John Jay singles player to compete at states, and the first since CeCe Crystal in 2006. \n“It’s always tough to lose, but in this case we live to play another day. We’ve got more work ahead of us and more great things to come. So we’ll see if we can dial up the magic a few more times,” Racanelli said. “There’s no doubt about the courage and character of Anya Ivenitsky. She’s a great competitor on the court, and she’s an awesome person off the court.” \n“I’m just looking to play my best, and to train for the next week,” Ivenitsky said of the state tourney. “But get some rest, too.” Anya Ivenitsky returns a shot during the Section 1 singles championship match on Thursday in Harrison. — J.B.
