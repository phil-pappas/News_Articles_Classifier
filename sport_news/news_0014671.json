They are always going to be a strong outfit going into this tournament,” Louw said. \n“For us it is not really a concern in the sense that to be the best you have to beat the best, and we take it week by week and focus on the team that we have to face in the week. \n“That happens to be the All Blacks now in the semi-final. Our focus will be on them. \n“Our paths have crossed a lot in the past and it is always a big game, a bit of a derby really. We will plan accordingly in our preparation and work hard this week.” \nSouth Africa were considered a national disgrace after Japan beat them 34-32 in their opening game. But the Springboks’ confidence has gained in strength with every game since. \nLouw however said he was surprised at how easily France were beaten. \n“France are a very good outfit and when they do play well, when they do click they can beat any team on the day. \n“I didn’t manage to catch the full game so I didn’t see which areas they were weak in, but I thought they would put up a stronger fight against the All Blacks.” \nReflecting on the win against Wales, Louw said the small margins made a difference in the match, which the Boks snatched with a Fourie du Preez try five minutes before the end. \n“We always knew it would be a tough challenge going up against Wales, they are not a bad team at all.
