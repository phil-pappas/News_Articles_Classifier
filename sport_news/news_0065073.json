The inspectors will now depose in the court against their then immediate supervisor as Meena was heading the EOW when he was arrested. The CBI today filed a 2,000-page chargesheet in the CBI court against DSP Meena (on deputation from Delhi), SI Surinder Kumar and two other persons — Sanjay Dahuja, owner of Berkeley Automobiles, and Aman Grover, owner of KLG Hotel — all of whom were arrested in August this year in a Rs 40 lakh corruption case. Inspector Charanjeet Singh and Inspector Jaswinder Singh of the UT police, who were then posted with the EOW, have been made key prosecution witnesses as per the CBI chargesheet. The chargesheet has been filed under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act against all four accused. Inspectors Charanjeet Singh and Jaswinder Singh were involved in conducting raids at various places when the case against CBI complainant Guneet Kaur’s parents was being investigated by the EOW. Both have stated to the CBI that the raids were being conducted at the behest of DSP Meena. The CBI has attached written transcripts of recorded conversations between Aman Grover and complainant Guneet Kaur in which the former is making a direct reference that the bribe amount is meant to be given to DSP Meena. Transcripts of a conversation between accused Sanjay Dahuja and DSP Meena, their meeting at a Sector 26 restaurant corroborated by CCTV footage, all pointing to the Rs 40 lakh deal between them, form part of the chargesheet. The CBI has also attached a cheque for Rs 30 lakh that was paid to accused Aman Grover by the complainant as a bribe. According to the chargesheet, a complaint was received by the CBI from Guneet Kaur alleging that Deepa Duggal had got an FIR registered with the EOW on December 12, 2014, against her (Guneet’s) parents Gurkirpal Singh Chawla and Jagjit Kaur Chawla, and her brother Hamrit Singh Chawla. Aman Grover is the son-in-law of Deepa Duggal and Sanjay Dahuja is his friend. The CBI said Aman Grover contacted Guneet Kaur and informed her that Sanjay Dahuja was in contact with DSP (EOW) Ram Chander Meena and SI Surinder Kumar. Aman Grover further informed that DSP Meena and SI Surinder demanded a bribe of Rs 70 lakh through Sanjay Dahuja for not arresting her parents and brother and to reach a compromise in the case. The CBI stated that Rs 40 lakh was to be paid to the police officials and Rs 30 lakh to Aman Grover to get the matter settled. The CBI laid a trap and recovered Rs 40 lakh and a post-dated cheque for Rs 30 lakh from Aman Grover. The remaining accused were then arrested. After the four were arrested, the CBI had grilled two inspectors — Charanjeet Singh and Jaswinder Singh — then posted with the EOW – to throw more light on the case. Both these inspectors have now been made prosecution witnesses.
