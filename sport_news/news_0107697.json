At 5-6, 175 pounds with average speed, Lynch is a thinking man's linebacker. “Richard's not the biggest or the fastest, but he covers for it by being smart and knowing where he's supposed to be,” Bastrop linebackers coach Earl “Skip” Thaxton said. “He plays bigger than his size. If he was any bigger, he would be hard to deal with.” As a second-year starter, Lynch has a firm grasp of the Rams' defensive scheme. “He knows the defense better this year, and he's playing with a lot more confidence,” Thaxton said. Thaxton and Lynch have been together since their days at Morehouse Junior High. “We came over to Bastrop High the same year,” Thaxton said. “I've been coaching him for five years now.” Thaxton says the soft-spoken Lynch has been a pleasure to coach. “Richard's a good kid,” Thaxton said. “He plays real hard. He's real coachable. When you ask him to do something, he's going to do it to the best of his ability. He doesn't have an attitude. If you tell him something, it's always, 'Yes, sir.'” Bastrop continues District 2-4A play Friday night in Winnsboro vs. Franklin Parish. FIRST QUARTER BDE: When did you start playing football? Richard Lynch: I played flag, then I played Pee Wee for the Falcons and coach (Quickman) Trotter. BDE: What memory stands out from your first season? Lynch: Going against Orion (Murphy) head-to-head in practice, trying to see who was stronger. BDE: What are your favorite and least favorite aspects of football? Lynch: My favorite part is winning and making big hits. My least favorite part is being injured. SECOND QUARTER BDE: How important was it to bounce back with a strong showing against Tioga after the Neville game? Lynch: It was very important because it helped get the bad taste out of our mouths and gave us motivation to keep going. BDE: How is the linebacker corps shaping up? Lynch: It's coming along pretty good. We've had our ups and downs, but I feel like we're stronger this year. BDE: What is the biggest improvement you have made since last year? Lynch: My confidence. I'm not scared to make a play because I'm more confident on the field. Page 2 of 2 - BDE: Which teammate has been the most pleasant surprise this season? Lynch: Travez (Moore). I feel like he's grown up over the past year. He's making more plays and maturing. THIRD QUARTER BDE: What challenges does Franklin Parish's offense present for the Rams' defense? Lynch: They have a big offensive line. Franklin Parish always seems to play their best game against us. We beat them last year, then they turned around and beat us in the playoffs. They always want to beat Bastrop. It's a game they really look forward to. BDE: What is the hardest you have ever been hit? Lynch: We were playing Shiloh in Week 2, and I got cracked by a lineman. I had to sit out a whole week. BDE: What is the hardest hit you have ever delivered? Lynch: Last year when we were playing Clarksdale, Mississippi, I hit their running back. I filled the hole, and POW! I remember coach Bradshaw telling me it was a good hit. FOURTH QUARTER BDE: If you could go back and change one thing over the past four years, what would you do differently? Lynch: I would have lifted weights more and trained my body harder, so I could be a better athlete now. BDE: What are you going to miss the most about playing high school football? Lynch: I'm going to miss the competition and the challenges, and being with all my brothers on the field. BDE: What are your future plans? Lynch: I plan on going into the Air Force and eventually becoming a physical therapist. BDE: Why the Air Force? Lynch: I feel like it's the best branch of the military for me to be a part of. I can take classes for college credit while I'm in the Air Force. After four years, I plan to go to college at Louisiana Tech.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:49:47.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
