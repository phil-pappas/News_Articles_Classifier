LOS ANGELES – Daniel Murphy unleashed a powerful swing that sent a pitch into the right field seats, and the crowd of 54,602 at Dodger Stadium went silent.\nThe second baseman had just given the Mets the lead in the sixth inning of Game 5 of the NLDS, besting Zack Greinke for the third time in this elimination game.\nThree innings later, the crowd was hushed again, this time as Jeurys Familia recorded the final out by striking out Howie Kendrick. Familia jumped up and down repeatedly before being mobbed by his teammates to celebrate the win.\nThe Mets will play for the chance to go the World Series.\nThey rallied to defeat the Dodgers, 3-2, on Thursday night, and claimed this best-of-five series.\nMurphy had an all-time performance with a 3-for-4 night that included two RBI and two runs scored, and Jacob deGrom (2-0) outdueled one of the Dodgers’ aces for the second time in this series while gutting through six innings.\nThe Mets will host the Cubs in Game 1 of the NLCS on Saturday night at Citi Field. It will be their first appearance in the NLCS since 2006.\n“It’s an unbelievable feeling to have these guys play the way they did,” Mets manager Terry Collins said. “When you go in a five-game series and got [Clayton] Kershaw and Greinke four times, and you win, you’d better be proud of yourself.\n“Because that’s a tremendous accomplishment to pull that off.”\nIn what could have been his final game as a Met because he’s a pending free agent, Murphy, produced an all-time performance that will be remembered in Mets lore.\nHis RBI double produced the game’s first run in the first inning, and then made a heady play in the fourth that was reminiscent of one by the Yankees’ Johnny Damon in the 2009 World Series.\nAfter singling to start the inning, Murphy advanced to second when Lucas Duda walked with one out. As Murphy ran to second, he recognized that no Dodger was covering third base due to the shift on Duda, and sprinted to the bag and reached safely.\nHe scored on Travis d’Arnaud’s sacrifice fly to even the game at 2.\n“When he’s on the bases, he’s always trying to take an extra base, sometimes not the best times,” Collins said. “But tonight was the best time.”\nMurphy, who also homered twice in this series off Kershaw, then gave the Mets a 3-2 lead when he hit a 3-2 pitch into the seats in the right field corner.\nMurphy hit .333 in the NLDS with three homers and five RBI, and in the emotional clubhouse after the game was doused in beer by Yoenis Cespedes.\nFans chanted “re-sign” Murphy after the game while players were on the field.\n“A level of surprise and euphoria. It was awesome,” Murphy said of his homer. “I think for the entire ballclub this is unbelievable.”\nWith his team’s season on the line, deGrom turned in perhaps the gutsiest effort of his career. The Dodgers had multiple opportunities to blow open Thursday’s game, yet deGrom never yielded and held them 2-for-13 with runners in scoring position.\nCollins said there were three instances where he considered pulling deGrom early in the game, but deGrom never surrendered the bone-crushing hit.\nDeGrom allowed four straight one-out singles to put the Mets in a 2-1 hole in the first, but then retired the Dodgers in each of their next 11 at-bats with a runner in scoring position. In a key moment in the third with runners on the corners and one out, deGrom induced an inning-ending double-play grounder from Enrique Hernandez.\nHe allowed those two runs on six hits, before entrusting the final nine outs to Noah Syndergaard and Familia, who recorded a career-high two-inning save.\n“This moment is unbelievable,” deGrom said. “I knew it was going to be a close game, and I give us a chance to win. The guys came through and did a great job.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:35:00.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
