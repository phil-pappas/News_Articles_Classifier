For on Friday and Saturday nights, MacArthur Fellow, Columbia University professor and longtime AACM member George Lewis will present the world premiere of \"Afterword, An Opera.\"\nYes, as the title suggests, Lewis has penned an opera inspired by his landmark, 2008 book, \"A Power Stronger Than Itself: The AACM and American Experimental Music\" (University of Chicago Press). The volume documents the prehistory, emergence and blossoming of the AACM in copious detail, making it essential reading for anyone who wants to learn how a group of South Side freethinkers revivified the art and infrastructure of jazz half a century ago.\nFor all the virtues of this tome, however, it does not instantly cry out for operatic treatment. Or at least it poses a formidable hurdle for anyone attempting such a thing.\n\"How do you get an academic book — how do you stuff that into a libretto?\" asks composer Lewis, who has been wrestling with that question for some time.\nNot that Lewis saw visions of operatic glory when he completed a book he had spent more than a decade writing.\nBut while Lewis served as a resident scholar at the University of Chicago's Franke Institute for the Humanities in 2010, he says, institute director James Chandler \"made an offhand remark that the book on the AACM would be a wonderful source for a theater piece.\nLaurence Hobgood offers electrifying sneak peek at bold new music Howard Reich Pianist Laurence Hobgood will be making a significant statement in 2016.\nThat's when his newest recording, \"Honor Thy Fathers,\" will be released, but Chicago listeners who crowded the Green Mill Jazz Club on Friday night heard a sneak preview of the music (and snapped up advance copies that Hobgood...\nPianist Laurence Hobgood will be making a significant statement in 2016.\nThat's when his newest recording, \"Honor Thy Fathers,\" will be released, but Chicago listeners who crowded the Green Mill Jazz Club on Friday night heard a sneak preview of the music (and snapped up advance copies that Hobgood...\n(Howard Reich) \"And I thought: What?\"\nIndeed, at first glance the notion might seem preposterous, considering the rigorous nature of Lewis' musical analysis and the intricacies of his arguments. Thoughts of Verdi and Puccini do not immediately come to mind while one studies Lewis' book.\nBut look more closely at it, and you indeed see no shortage of drama, as well as passages of inspiring dialogue. Both the AACM and jazz itself, after all, have deep roots in American slavery and African antiquity, themes that resonate in literature, cinema and, of course, music.\nThe organization, moreover, emerged amid stress and conflict, elements essential to any opera worthy of the name.\n\"The first-generation AACM founders were all children of the first wave of migrants to venture north,\" Lewis writes in the book.\n\"All of these people that we are talking about came from very, very struggling environments,\" AACM veteran Joseph Jarman adds in the volume. \"Every one of them started out at the bottom — maybe not the flat bottom, but pretty close.\"\nPainting jazz: Chicago artist sketches the scene Howard Reich Perhaps you've seen him at the Green Mill or Constellation, seated close to the action, focusing intently on the musicians, glancing down at his sketchpad then looking back up at the stage.\nHis arm moves constantly, reaching for certain colors, applying them to paper, creating forms and shapes...\nPerhaps you've seen him at the Green Mill or Constellation, seated close to the action, focusing intently on the musicians, glancing down at his sketchpad then looking back up at the stage.\nHis arm moves constantly, reaching for certain colors, applying them to paper, creating forms and shapes...\n(Howard Reich) As the 1950s gave way to the '60s, the musicians saw the Chicago jazz scene drying up and taking their livelihoods with it. Youth-oriented rock 'n' roll, changing population patterns and other galvanic social factors were driving jazz from the clubs, the radio and public consciousness, leaving the city's jazz artists with dramatically diminished opportunities.\n\"You see, we were musicians who had come up under Bird and Dizzy and all of these guys, and then we looked up one day, and all that was snatched away,\" AACM co-founder Phil Cohran says in the book. \"There was a general feeling that we had been robbed of our culture. So we stopped and we started talking about how tough times are. … We wanted to do something about it.\"\nThe opera touches upon this sweeping history, following the book \"in some sense,\" says Lewis.\n\"The first act talks about the Great Migration\" of African-Americans to Chicago. \"Then it goes on to these young migrants — the parents, really, of the musicians — coming to Chicago and finding that ... it wasn't the paradise they'd been hoping for.\"\nA subsequent scene evokes the first meeting of the AACM, says Lewis, \"where there's a lot of contention about originality and creativity. … The organization lasts about a year, and they start arguing about the same issues. It goes through all of those things. It takes us to Paris — you can see what happens there.\"\nObviously, Lewis did not lack for source material, turning to his own interviews, as well as audio recordings of early AACM meetings made by co-founder Muhal Richard Abrams, to generate dialogue and discern themes.\nThe protagonists are \"young, African-American experimental musicians (concerned with) issues of representation, race, culture, self-expression, using music as a kind of critical tool,\" says Lewis. \"They're confronting power, authority. They're thinking about identity and culture, all the stuff that was going on at this time, which is being confronted with the music.\n\"So that's what the opera tries to do, is to look at those struggles.\"\nLewis' opus has had two incarnations to date, each inspiring his re-evaluation of the work. After a concert version in Brooklyn in May, Lewis decided that the piece \"was just too fast — things (were) happening too quickly. So I started rewriting all the scenes.\" Following a staged version in the Czech Republic in August, he wrote still more, meaning this weekend's premiere of the piece will be what he calls \"the entire thing … certainly the longest piece of music I've ever written.\"\nHe has gathered quite a cast, including members of both the International Contemporary Ensemble and the AACM, and featuring such admired figures as Douglas Ewart, Ann Ward, Coco Elysses and Khari B.\nAnd though Lewis doesn't write scores that include improvisation anymore, he says, he realizes that \"this is Chicago, and this is the AACM.\" Thus \"Afterword,\" directed by Sean Griffin in collaboration with Catherine Sullivan, is providing \"spaces in which (improvisers) dialogue with the composed music.\"\nWhere will Lewis, who's also a dynamic trombonist, be as all of this unfolds?\n\"I sit in the audience, which I love doing,\" he says, with a laugh.\nLike the rest of us, he'll be waiting to see how it all comes together.\n\"Afterword, An Opera\" plays at 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday at the Museum of Contemporary Art, 220 E. Chicago Ave.; $30. \"Afterword, the conversation,\" featuring George Lewis, Sean Griffin, Jacqueline Stewart and James Chandler, will start at 2 p.m. Saturday at the MCA; free, but reservations required. 312-397-4010 or www.mcachicago.org .\nhreich@tribpub.com\nTwitter @howardreich\n\"Portraits in Jazz\": Howard Reich's e-book collects his exclusive interviews with Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald and others, plus past masters such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday.
