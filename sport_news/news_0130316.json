But at the same time, they've lit a fire under the neighbor's feet and they're taking a stand. But one local builder hopes to snuff out everyone's concerns. \nOn any given day, you will find some Avera employees smoking in front of this unoccupied house that's owned by Avera on the corner of 20th Street and 7th Avenue. \nCigarette butts litter the sidewalks. \nBoyer lives right next door and is fed up with the smokers and the mess they leave behind. \n\"I've had confrontations with them. I've come out and taken pictures of them; told them I'd take them across the street if they couldn't move down,\" Boyer said. \nBoyer has even posted a no smoking sign in her front lawn, which she says they've taken down. \n\"I just stick it back in the ground and just smile at them and tell them, 'Have a wonderful day,'\" Boyer said. \nGary Carter lives down the street a few houses away and says he sees the smokers constantly. \n\"If it was my house I'd chase them off because I don't like cigarette butts,\" Carter said. \nThis ongoing problem may have a simmering solution. \nBuilder John Koch has offered Avera a couple of options for the house. \n\"One option would be Avera sells me the house and then my crews come in and restore that home and we'll create a nice rental property here,\" Koch said. \nThe other option Koch offered is to hire him to remodel it for Avera and they can rent it out or auction it off. \n\"I'd like to see it stay. Structurally, I think the house is in good shape; it's a beautiful home,\" Koch said. \nBut according to neighbors, the cigarette butts discarded on the sidewalks in this neighborhood aren't so beautiful. \n\"This is a neighborhood; we all live here and sleep here. Avera has two places right up the street on their property that they can make a smoking place for their people that makes Avera not the good neighbor,\" Boyer said. \nAvera issued this statement to KELOLAND News: \"The property at S. 7th Ave. and 20th St. has been owned by Avera for many years and uninhabited for the past seven. The structure itself is not habitable without major renovation. While Avera is open to selling the house structure, we want to make sure that we have appropriate information for any potential buyer about the structure. We are conducting an inspection and expect that information to be available to us in the next month. This property is part of our Avera McKennan Hospital and University Health Center campus sitting adjacent to our Emergency Department. Avera will maintain ownership of the land. While we have no definite future plans for the lot, we can say that we will not allow smoking on this property. Avera went smoke-free more than 10 years ago. We do know we want to improve the aesthetics of the property, and we look forward to working with the community.\" Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
