CLIFTON — The referee’s call was made and Meaghan Mancini had no doubt who was taking the ensuing penalty kick with the game on the line.\n“I wanted it to myself,” the fearless Clifton sophomore said with a smile in a cold and steady rain Thursday night, just moments after being taken down in the box late in double overtime.\n“I wanted to put it in and end this game.”\nTied at 1 against rival Wayne Hills with 1:40 left before the game ended in a tie, Mancini, with no hesitation, unleashed the game-winning penalty kick in the Mustangs’ thrilling 2-1 victory at Clifton Stadium.\nShe wasn’t nervous. She knew where she planned to shoot it. And she delivered with the kind of poise often reserved for upperclassmen.\n“At this point, we try to let the girls figure it out themselves as to who takes the penalty kicks,” Mustangs coach Konrad Kruczek said. “This way I’m not putting any pressure on anyone.\n“We’ve been very pleased with Meaghan. Being only a sophomore, she already has that confidence to score goals, which is a very positive thing to see.”\nMancini’s goal, her team-best 10th, ignited a wild celebration in front of the net after Clifton improved to 9-0.\nThe Mustangs earned some measure of revenge after falling to the Patriots (6-1) in the past two Passaic County finals, including 1-0 in double overtime in last year’s championship game.\nMancini earned a shot at the game-winner after chasing down a loose 50-50 ball in the box.\nA collision with Wayne Hills’ fast approaching goalie resulted in a call that Patriots coach Gregg Rehberger expressed his displeasure with.\nMancini, a fast and physical threat any time the ball is at her feet, said it was the first penalty kick she has taken since drilling one with her club team three months ago. And that includes practices.\nThe win serves as a confidence booster for the Mustangs heading into the county tournament, where they could see Wayne Hills — recently awarded the No. 1 seed — again.\n“Honestly, losing last year’s county final to them was very sad,” said Mancini, a starter on that squad.\n“It was pretty devastating. So coming from that, to this, it feels great. But we still are focused on winning the county. That’s our goal.\n“We just have to play like we did today. We have to play our hearts out.”\nClifton, which received strong defensive performances from Sharon Garcia, Rachel Ramayoni, Chelsea Robinson and Catherine Jordan, jumped ahead quickly when Brittany Morales sent home a loose ball in the box in the third minute.\nWayne Hills, which controlled play for much of the second half, scored the equalizer with 13:40 left in regulation when Meghan Griffin deposited a close-range rebound off a shot on goal taken by Madison Carlo.\n“This is a very big win for us, especially after losing to Wayne Hills in double overtime last year and giving up a goal late in that game,” Kruczek said.\n“This was a little revenge for all the Clifton girls. They wanted to win. They really wanted to win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:57:29.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
