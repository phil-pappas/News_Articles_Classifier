The Cowboys enter the showdown with the Longhorns undefeated. Texas looks to rebound from a tough 45-44 loss to California and end Oklahoma State's winning streak Saturday.\nHere are five things Texas fans should know about Oklahoma State:\n1. Rudolph's efficiency\nSophomore quarterback Mason Rudolph enters Saturday's game as the No. 12 most efficient quarterback in the nation. He's completed 62-of-90 passes thrown in three games. He's also amassed 947 passing yards which has him tied for No. 10 in the country. Rudolph has thrown five touchdowns to one interception in 2015.\nThe Longhorns' defense has struggled this season. Texas has given up 271.1 passing yards per game. Rudolph brings a tough challenge for a reeling defense.\n2. Rugged defense\nOklahoma State brings a tough defense to Austin. Although they've played a relatively easy schedule with games against Central Michigan, Central Arkansas and UTSA, the Cowboys' defense is ranked No. 26 in total defense. Oklahoma State has held its opponents to 187.7 passing yards and 115.3 rushing yards per game.\nTexas' offense exploded for 650 yards and 44 points against California but the Cowboys' defense could stymie an emerging Longhorn offense.\n3. Sterns, Ogbah lead Cowboy defense\nJunior safety Jordan Sterns and redshirt junior defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah lead the Oklahoma State defense.\nSterns leads the team and the Big 12 in tackles with 28 total tackles. The Cibolo native has recorded one forced fumble, one pass break up and one tackle for loss.\nOgbah is a projected top 10 NFL draft pick in 2016 . He has 13 total tackles, six quarterback hurries, 4.5 tackles for loss and 3.5 sacks.\nHe's an All-American candidate who has received double teams because of his ability to find the ball.\n4. Rudolph's favorite target David Glidden\nRedshirt senior David Glidden has become Rudolph's favorite target. The Rudolph to Glidden connection has been used 12 times this season. Glidden has 283 receiving yards on 12 receptions.\nHe's scored three times this year. His best game this year came against Central Arkansas where he caught four passes for 165 yards and two touchdowns. Glidden has three touchdowns on the season.\nLook for Rudolph to find his receiver against the Longhorns on Saturday.\n5. Cowboys on three-game winning streak in Austin\nOklahoma State has won three straight games against the Longhorns at Darrell K Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium. The Cowboys beat Texas in 2013, 38-13, with the help two interceptions by cornerback Justin Gilbert and a career-rushing game from quarterback Clint Chelf.\nThe Cowboys won in 2011, 38-26, and 33-16 in 2010. The win in 2011 made Oklahoma State the first team to defeat Texas in Austin two years in a row since 1911.\nThe Cowboys will look to make it four-straight wins over Texas in Austin.\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-09-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:25:01.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
