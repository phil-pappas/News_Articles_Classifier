(Postmedia Network file photo) Report an error \nAn Ontario college has suspended its men’s and women’s varsity rugby programs after alleged violations of the school’s code of expectations. \nHumber College says an internal investigation is underway into alleged misconduct, and players and coaches were told of the suspension on Friday afternoon. \nThe school’s code of expectations includes guidance on dress codes, hazing, alcohol and drug use, among other areas. \nHumber wouldn’t provide details of the alleged misconduct, only saying that it was not in keeping with its institutional values related to athletics and student life. \nHumber says all its varsity team players are told that “conduct detrimental to the team is not permitted and that any team not following the rules may be suspended.” \nIt says the teams are suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. \n“This was not an easy decision to come by,” said director of communications Andrew Leopold. “We take matters of our athletics, of our students, we take all this very seriously.” \nLeopold noted that the investigation was looking at the actions of both the men’s and women’s teams. \nHe added that the college would try to be as “efficient and effective” as possible in conducting its investigation. \nThe school also says it has informed the Ontario College Athletics Association and representatives from the other teams in their division of the suspension. \nHumber has campuses in Toronto and Orangeville, Ont.
