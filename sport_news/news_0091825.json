Here are some highlights:\nYou were also involved in something that went viral , you're in the bullpen, and somebody drops a towel down and you us e it...\nHolland: I'm going to go ahead and stop you right there because that's where everybody thinks that's how it went down...When I'm in the bullpen as a reliever, I have a different routine than I do as a starter because I have to find a way to get myself ready quick.\nSo once it's about the 3rd inning, I start doing some drills to get myself ready to go. I was throwing this weighted ball up against the wall, and this guy - any fan, when we're away, is always going to be talking smack, no matter what, that's just how it is - this guy continued to hound me, hound me, hound me, and I always interact with the fans. I didn't \"feed\" him. I'm just talking back, \"Yeah, I know. I do suck. Thanks man, I appreciate your support.\" Whatever. And the guy just kept going, then as I'm throwing, this towel comes flying down and...I forget what he said, but it's obviously not appropriate to say here. So I was like, \"Yeah, you want this towel back?\" And he said yeah, and I said, \"Well, here's what I think of your towel.\" And then I wipe my butt.\nNow - would I do it again? Yeah, I will because if you're going to interrupt me while I'm working, then that's disrespecting me so I'm going to disrespect you back. That's just the way I feel. I don't go to your work and interrupt you while you're answering phones or typing up papers. I'm never going to do that, so why would you do that to me? It's cool if you want to chirp at me, and do all that stuff, that's fine. But when you throw something at me, that's obviously too much. So I went back and wiped my butt with a towel, and congratulations Derek, you went viral for wiping your own butt.\nDid you get any commentary from your team or your teammates?\nHolland: They weren't surprised because it was me. Guys laughed. It's just one of those things. Once they know you're being disrespected - it would be like having Elvis [Andrus] in the on deck circle and they threw stuff at him - do you really think he's going to tolerate that?
