The rest of the field had at least 1 ½ seconds to make up in the second run. \n\"I can't really explain it. I asked twice if my time was really correct,\" said Brignone, who finished her run in sunny conditions on the Rettenbach glacier in 1 minute, 10.11 seconds. \nBrignone has finished seven times on a podium but is yet to win a GS. \nThe Italian also led here four years ago but skied out early in her second run as Lindsey Vonn took the win. The American skipped Saturday's race after having only just recovered from an ankle injury and chose to train super-G instead. \n\"I don't want to think about what happened back then,\" Brignone said about the 2011 race. \"I just want to make sure I ski well.\" \nBrignone drew praise from her rivals for her outstanding run. \n\"She hasn't surprised me,\" said Austria's Eva-Maria Brem, who came 2.30 off the lead in ninth. \"I said earlier this week that a win for her has long become due.\" \nShiffrin said: \"She's really powerful and deserves to be nine-tenths ahead.\" \nThe American won the race here last season for her sole victory in the GS so far. She shared the win with overall champion Anna Fenninger of Austria, who has been ruled out for the season after knee surgery. \n\"I felt like I actually had a good run. I was attacking and I made a few mistakes,\" Shiffrin said. \"It's really hard snow, like icy and a little bit grippy when you ski it. I felt like you can push out the snow and it totally came back. With each turn I got more confidence.\" \nSwitzerland's Lara Gut finished 1.51 behind in third, while another pre-race favorite, 2010 Olympic GS champion Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany, trailed Brignone by 2.96 in 12th. \nTime differences were so big that skiers with a 4.30-second deficit still qualified for the second run. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:48:30.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
