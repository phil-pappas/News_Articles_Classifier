Williams added a second score on Jasper's next possession, extending the Bulldogs' lead to 14-0. \nHolmes took over from there, finishing with a career-high 236 rushing yards and scoring the Bulldogs' final three touchdowns to secure the victory. \n\"(Decorian) ran well (Friday),\" Bulldogs' coach Darrell Barbay said. \"He got those dirty yards for us and really played well.\" \nTURNING POINT \nAfter the Battlin' Bears trimmed the lead to 21-7 with 5:28 left in the third quarter, the Bulldogs responded on the next drive and put the game out of reach. Holmes ran for 39 yards on the drive, capped off by a 25-yard touchdown run to push the lead back to three scores. \n\"We knew all along if we got stops we'd do well,\" Holmes said. \"We got stops and after that drives were a lot easier.\" \nMOST-SPECTACULAR PLAY \nHolmes finished off Jasper's scoring with a nine-yard touchdown run with 9:42 remaining, but it was Holmes' run on the play before the touchdown that impressed. Holmes took a handoff and ran left, but was bottled up, so he reversed field and sprinted down the right sideline, moving within the 10-yard line before eventually being caught by an LC-M defender. Holmes' cutback caught LC-M by surprise, so much so that a pair of Battlin' Bears defenders were blindsided by Bulldogs' blockers down the field. \n\"It was a slippery field,\" Holmes said. \"So once I saw some space to the right, I cut back. I was just surprised I got caught.\" \nBY THE NUMBERS \nSamuel King led LC-M with 149 rushing yards and a touchdown, but the Bulldogs' run defense was stout. Minus King's 65-yard third quarter run, the Battlin' Bears averaged 4.7 yards per rush. \nHE SAID IT \n\"We've got a chance (to win district),\" Barbay said. \"We have to play like we did (Friday) over the final two games if we're going to do it.\" \nRECORDS \nJasper 5-3, 4-0. LC-M 3-6, 2-3. \nNEXT UP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:19:46.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
