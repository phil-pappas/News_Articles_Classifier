But Aretha Franklin has way more soul than the Dawgs I've watched the past couple of weeks and is (fortunately) still alive, so I whole-heartedly apologize for this parody. Not enough to not post it, but I figured I'd at least make the gesture. So with apologies to Aretha Franklin: \nOriginal Version:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:43:22.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
