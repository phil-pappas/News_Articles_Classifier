So Mayor James, game on . . . go Jays.”\nRecreating Blue Jays slugger Jose Bautista’s memorable bat toss from Wednesday night’s game against the Texas Rangers, Tory then hurled a white baseball bat into the Nathan Phillips Square’s reflecting pool.\nJames issued the friendly challenge to Tory Thursday.\n“Congratulations on making it this far Mayor Tory and the Toronto Blue Jays, but we have a wager for you,” he said.\n“We are going to not lose, so I’m really more interested in what you’re going to do for us. I will warn you in advance, we have our own maple syrup, so something else maybe.”\nOn offer to Tory and Toronto for a win: a selection of ribs and sauces from three local restaurants.\nGame 1 of the ALCS gets underway at Ewing M.
