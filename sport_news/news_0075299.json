It was one of two defensive scores for the Branch, which also forced a safety in the second quarter to help give the Falcons a 16-7 lead at the interval. \nCortez Davis then caught a 60-yard touchdown pass from Kory Graham before running in a touchdown to help Flowery Branch to a 28-14 early in the fourth quarter. \nClarke Central's Jaqua Daniels broke loose for 144 yards rushing and two touchdowns, but the Falcons minimized the damage, holding the remainder of the Gladiators squad to negative yards rushing. \nTrey Wilcoxson rushed for 96 yards to pace Flowery Branch, while Davis caught five passes for 79 yards. \nFlowery Branch will look to make it two in a row next week when it plays host to Apalachee.
