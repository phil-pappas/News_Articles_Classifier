By denying it on sworn witness statements and oath Mr Cairns was committing perjury.\" \nCairns, 45, from Auckland, is charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice, while Fitch-Holland, from Burton Road, Manchester, is accused of perverting the course of justice. They both deny the charges. Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:55:00.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
