Tyler Dahlgren \nSenior Jordan Brown nearly came down with this interception on Benson's final drive. Tyler Dahlgren \nJunior Dylan Rahlfs, starting at quarterback for the first time this season, scored two touchdowns and led the team to a 21-20 win over Benson. \nAfter all they'd been through this fall, the Blair football team needed something to feel good about on a crisp Friday night. \nWhen junior linebacker Jarrett Branz darted through a hole in the Benson offensive line and dropped quarterback Sherman Smith Jr. on fourth down with just over a minute left in the game, the Blair sideline erupted. \nBlair 21 Benson 20. \nSenior Zane Boswell, lost for the season in last Friday's loss to Skutt, cheered for his fellow backers from a wheelchair on the track. \nJunior quarterback/safety Ethan Cox, out since the third quarter of the season opener against Elkhorn and sporting a walking boot, enthusiastically greeted the secondary as they came off the field. Most of them were second-teamers at the start of the season. Not anymore. \nSenior nose guard Jordan Groves, out with a torn labrum, encouraged the defensive line every time they trotted off the field. \nJunior tight end/defensive end Mills returned to action but the Bears were without starting safety/wide receiver Alex Wing, who is out with a knee injury. \nThe Bears, led by junior running back-turned-quarterback Dylan Rahlfs, took a 14-0 lead into halftime and jumped ahead 21-6 in the third quarter before the Bunnies mounted a late rally. \nIt was a powerful running game that helped the Bears gain some early distance. On their first drive, after junior Devon Wormuth recovered a Bunny fumble, Rahlfs carried for 11, 11 and 12 yards. Sophomore Dalton Lewis, starting his first game at running back, capped the drive with a tough four-yard touchdown, bullying his way through Bunnies before reaching the ball across the goal line. \nThe Bears tried to surprise the Bunnies with an onside kick, and nearly recovered the ball before it went out of bounds. Benson went three and out and Blair took over at their own 12-yard-line. \nWhat ensued was a long, time-consuming drive comprised of powerful runs from Rahlfs and Lewis. With 10 minutes to play in the second quarter, after the Bears had marched 84 yards down to the Benson three yard-line, Rahlfs snuck in around the right tackle for a touchdown. Peleska's kick was good, and Blair led 14-0. \nBlair senior Zach Dahlgren, thanks to a big block from Macek, nearly housed a Benson punt minutes later, weaving through Bunnies before being taken down at the two yard-line. But there was laundry on the field (a block in the back), and the Bears stalled on their next three possessions as the half came to an end. \n“In the first half we played much better than we did in the second half,” head coach Bryan Soukup said. “We did some good things offensively and the defense was playing great football. We came out and had a great first play in the third quarter but fumbled and we never really got the momentum back.” \nBlair caught a case of the fumbles in the third quarter, as Dahlgren and Rahlfs each gave one away. With 6:17 left in the third quarter, Benson scored from nine yards out on a quick seam rout, converting a turnover into six points. The extra point was no good, and Blair's lead had been cut to 14-6. \nRahlfs would add a touchdown with about a minute to go in the third quarter, scoring from a yard out after a screen pass to Dalton Lewis on a fourth and three put the Bears inside the Benson five. \nBenson took to the air in the fourth quarter, scoring two touchdowns and converting a two point conversion. Trailing 21-20, the Bunnies tried for two again, but the play was sniffed out by a gang of Bears in the backfield. \nBenson took over with just over two minutes to go at their own 18, but sacks from Billy Miller and Branz and two incompletions sealed the win for the Bears. \n“Our defense played well and did enough to get the stops when we needed them,” Soukup said. “We had a lot of kids step up tonight and play pretty well.” \nAt this point of the season, with district play looming next week, any win is a good win for a team's psyche and confidence. \n“We just needed to find a way to get a win tonight,” Soukup said. “We told the kids all week that it was going to be a battle. We fought hard and our kids found a way to win.” \nThe Bears will host Schuyler next Friday before traveling to Blair the following week. \n“It (the win) gives us a little bit of confidence and a boost going into district play starting next week,” Soukup said. “Hopefully we can put it together against Schuyler and we'll see what happens from there.” \nBlair 21 Benson 20 \nBenson (1-5) 0 0 6 14 20 \nBlair (2-4) 7 7 7 0 21 \n*Stats were not immediately available after the game but will be uploaded as soon as possible. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:32:06.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
