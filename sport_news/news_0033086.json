With the Oct. 31 deadline approaching, the Boston Celtics center has been badgered about the issue since the summer. \n\"Same place as last time we talked,\" he replied, suggesting nothing is imminent. \"Nothing really has changed.\" \nAccording to the Boston Herald's Steve Bulpett, \"It's looking like things will remain that way.\" Bulpett reported Friday that the Celtics will only agree to contract extensions with Zeller and/or Jared Sullinger if a \"very favorable\" deal for the team can be reached. \nThat might have been Boston's objective from the start. Team president of basketball operations Danny Ainge has been very obvious about his desire to maintain cap flexibility after this season. \nWithout extensions, both players would become restricted free agents next summer with cap holds of $6.5 million for Zeller and $5.7 million for Sullinger. This past offseason, the Celtics maximized their cap space by keeping Jae Crowder's low cap hold on the books even after they had agreed to keep him on a five-year, $35-million deal. That way, they were able to make other moves before finalizing the forward's contract. \nPerry Jones is also eligible for an extension but appears to be fighting for a roster spot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:59:41.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
