It bears no connection to events and characters in real life.\nFailing to find a single celebrity in current season of Bigg Boss, an enraged viewer today sued makers of the show for cheating its loyal audience by stuffing nobodies in the show.\n\"I have no idea who they are,\" he said pointing to the contestants, \"Nobody told me that makers were picking random people this year; otherwise I would have stationed myself outside Viacom office in order to get noticed.\"\n\"Frankly none of them carry credentials of a celeb. Worse, almost none of them are known to me or anyone in my family or friend circle. And mind you, all of us are voracious film and TV buffs,\" he told our reporter from outside Bombay High Court.\n\"I mean sometimes I feel as if Arvind Kejriwal is directing Bigg Boss this time, hence so many aam aadmis in the show,\" he further added, \"You won't believe, I have more followers than most of them on Twitter.\"\nREAD: TV Series Review: Reporters\nWhen our reporter asked him if he had erred by not considering actress Rimi Sen as celebrity, he shot back, \"You call her celebrity? At best she is Yami Gautam of the era gone by. If you call her celeb, then Rahul Roy is a Hollywood superstar.\"\nOur reporter then spoke to a source from Colors channel, who under conditions of anonymity disclosed, \"You know how every year we have to quadruple Salman's fees in order to convince him to stay. Now it has reached a point where we are virtually left with no more money to pay real celebs, hence the pathetic quality of contestants.\"\nMeanwhile another viewer, who could only identify Aman Verma on the show (courtesy: sting operation on him), has decided to sue makers for having not a single controversial or sensational personality on the show.\n\"What the hell is this? If I wanted to see such positivity on TV, I would have watched shows on Aastha Channel instead,\" he argued.\nDISCLAIMER: This post is a work of fiction intended to bring a smile to your face.
