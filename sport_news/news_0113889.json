Gossar took the lead on Lap 26 when Poore got trapped behind a slower car entering Turn 3. \nPoore returned to the lead following a restart on Lap 37 with an outside pass of Gossar. \nThe 2015 Street Stock champion at Anderson Speedway was never able to shake a determined Gossar, who was lurking only a few car-lengths back of the leader. \nJeremy Threet finished third, the last car on the lead lap. Johnny Magee came home fourth followed by Brian McKinney. \n“Travis Burge worked on this car all week,” Poore said in the AutoFarm McCrocklin Ford winner’s circle. “It only got finished on Thursday night. I knew Trent (Gossar) was fast. I know he’s a clean driver so I knew it would be a good race.” \nA strong run by Jeff Swinford came to an end on Lap 61 when it appeared he lost an engine in Turn 2 while running fourth. The incident collected the fifth-place car of Larry Southerland. \nSwinford started 16th in the field and worked his way up, cracking the top five on Lap 40. \nMarcum Welding Pro Compact champion Matt Tharp made it two feature wins in the last three races. \nTharp worked his way up through the field and was running second on Lap 8 when he spun entering Turn 2. \nBut that didn’t prevent him from the victory. \nOn the restart, Nick Warner took the point from early race leader Gossar, but Gossar returned to the lead a lap later with an inside move on the back straight. \nTharp used the same move to slip around Warner, and on Lap 16 he got inside of Gossar coming off the second corner and drove away to a comfortable win. \nWarner finished second with Kyle Allmond nipping Gossar at the finish line for third. \n“I could get used to this,” Tharp said in his return to the AutoFarm McCrocklin Ford winner’s circle. “During the season we were point racing, now we’re going for the wins.” \nFollow Ken de la Bastide on Twitter @KendelaBastide, or call 640-4863. \n​Follow Ken de la Bastide on Twitter @KendelaBastide, or call 640-4863.
