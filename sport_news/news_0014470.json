Brian Westbrook's punt return in 2003 not only snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, it also saved a season that had begun with three losses in the first five games. Seven years later, the Eagles scored 28 fourth-quarter points in East Rutherford, N.J., with the game ending on a scintillating 65-yard punt return by DeSean Jackson. \nIn between those two miracles, Donovan McNabb dialed up a playoff victory at the Meadowlands in a year when the Giants looked like the best team in the NFL. \nThe five games mentioned above might rank among the top 20 wins in franchise history. \nOddly, however, the Giants are also the cruelest rival of any professional Philadelphia sports team, especially in this century. Despite all those dramatic victories over their closest NFC neighbor, it is the Giants that have had far more happy endings, including four Super Bowl titles. \nEven though the Eagles won that 1960 championship to delay the start of Vince Lombardi's Green Bay dynasty and even though the Giants lost two NFL title games in 1958 and 1959 and three more from 1961-63, they are more remembered in that era for being part of the league's so-called greatest game ever against the Baltimore Colts. \nFar more difficult to digest for Eagles fans is what happened in later years. Dick Vermeil will always be remembered for leading the Eagles to their first Super Bowl, and the Eagles won his first 11 games against the Giants with him as coach. He lost his last three, however before citing \"burnout\" as his reason for resigning after the 1982 season. The Giants hired Bill Parcells before the 1983 season, which officially turned the balance of power in New York's favor. \nWhen blustery Buddy Ryan arrived in 1986, he got the Eagles back to the point where they could beat the Giants. In fact, he went 5-5 in the five years he coached against Parcells, including five wins in their final six games. The cruel part was that Parcells and the Giants won two Super Bowls. Ryan and the Eagles, as we all know, never won a playoff game. \nThe new century started with the Giants winning three times, including a playoff game, on their way to a Super Bowl loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Far more painful for the Eagles is what has happened after that. From 2001 through 2012, Andy Reid's Eagles went 16-9 against the Giants, won six NFC East titles and made eight playoff appearances. They've also won another NFC East title under Chip Kelly. \nBut you know the sad Philadelphia story. The Giants, despite winning three fewer division titles and making three fewer playoff appearances, have added two more Super Bowl titles with two underwhelming teams. You could say their titles were flukes, but these things are not graded for season-long aesthetic value. \nGiants coach Tom Coughlin, with two Super Bowl titles, has a chance of one day being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Reid, despite a 13-8 record against Coughlin, including a couple of playoff victories, does not. \nThe crux of this rivalry is that the Eagles, for a long, long time, have not only been as good as the Giants, they have been better. Since 1960, the year of the franchise's last NFL title, the Eagles are 60-51-1 against Big Blue with a lopsided advantage in dramatic victories. But the Giants' four Super Bowl wins just makes the rivalry so, so unkind for the Eagles and their fans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:28:59.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
