Matic lost an easy pass when he came on, on Saturday, and the first reaction he had was to show a disappointment,\" Mourinho told reporters ahead of the Champions League clash with Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday.\n\"When you are full of confidence you don't show disappointment. You make a mistake, you know that you're not going to make another mistake after. So (stay) calm, let's go step by step.\n\"When you are a little bit fragile, simple. Make it simple. Think quick, make the right decision. Take the ball out of the pressure zone. Don't be worried about making a beautiful pass.\n\"Make just sure that you don't lose the ball, because if you lose the ball, you lose confidence. So, you know, step by step, step by step,\" the former Real Madrid manager added.\nMourinho was coy when asked about Chelsea's chances of picking up a trophy this season.\n\"We can win all four, we can lose all four. I think it is (possible), but I think it's also possible to lose all four. We are in October. Everything is open. We can win all four, we can lose all four,\" the 52-year-old Portuguese said.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:11:26.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
