He's capable of bowling 15-20 overs to make the captain's job easier. We will miss his experience,\" skipper Tiwary said.\nAt the same time, Bengal would look forward to the return of promising opener Abhimanyu Easwaran as he along with Naved, fresh from his 95 in Bengaluru, would look to give the team a solid foundation.\n\"Abhimanyu is technically very sound and we saw how impressive he was last season. He lends solidity atop the order,\" Tiwary said.\nBengal have drafted in left-arm spinner Pradipta Pramanik and it remains to be seen whether he would be handed debut to bowl alongside Prgyan Ojha and offie Aamir Gani.\nThe former India spinner was innocuous against Karnataka and returned with one wicket from his 41 overs, but skipper Tiwary backed the Hyderabadi recruit.\n\"We know he's a match winner and is capable of running through a line-up. It's just a matter of one or two good spells... He's working very hard at the moment.\"\nMeanwhile, there's some rain forecast over the next few days and the Eden groundsmen, who're without regular curator Probir Mukherjee, are set for a big test.\nMukherjee has stopped coming after the India-South Africa T20I was called off without a ball being bowled because of wet outfield and the pitch for the match is being prepared by his assistant Shankarshan Pal.
