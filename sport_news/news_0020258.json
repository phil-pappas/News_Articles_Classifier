Running back Isaiah Crowell lost two yards on a run to the right.\nOn second down, quarterback Josh McCown looked to his right for wide receiver Travis Benjamin, but Denver cornerback Aqib Talib jumped the route and sprinted 63 yards to the end zone with the Broncos' eighth interception of the season.\nThe Browns cut their 10-0 halftime deficit to a field goal with a touchdown on their first possession of the third quarter when McCown threw a 12-yard fade to tight end Gary Barnidge in the back right corner of the end zone.\nTwice in the third quarter after cutting the lead to 10-7 the Browns got the ball back with good field position but each time the Broncos refused to yield. One Cleveland possession beginning at the Browns 35 ended in a three-and-out and one that started at the Browns 48 ended with a strip sack by Broncos linebacker Shaq Barrett. Barrett recovered the fumble to set up a 25-yard field goal by McManus.\nMcManus kicked his third field goal of the game for a 16-7 lead and then the Browns cut it to 16-14 on a 14-yard touchdown pass to Barnidge with 9:20 left.\n(Editing by Steve Keating.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:00:12.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
