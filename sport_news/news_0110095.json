Ryan Goins also connected and had a two-run single, one game after his misplayed pop fly set off Kansas City's winning rally Sunday. Veteran knuckleballer R.A. Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series Tuesday afternoon. He faces Kansas City's 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young in Game 4. After the resilient Royals rallied for four runs in the ninth, Roberto Osuna closed it out. In the first ALCS game in Toronto since 1993, Tulowitzki connected for a three-run shot off Johnny Cueto, and Donaldson hit a two-run drive off Kris Medlen as the Blue Jays hit their first home runs of the series. Cueto failed to retire a batter in the third inning, allowing eight runs and six hits in the worst postseason start of his career.
