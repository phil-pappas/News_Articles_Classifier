A September dive in left field upset his right shoulder and eventually ended his season with a handful of games remaining.\n\"Everybody plays through nicks and injuries,\" Brantley said. \"I'll never make an excuse or use that to lean on anything. ... I'll always push to play.\"\nBrantley still played in 137 games this season, and he posted numbers awfully similar to the ones that earned him a third-place finish in the balloting for the 2014 American League Most Valuable Player award.\n2014: 156 games, .327/.385/.506 slash line, 20 home runs, 97 RBIs, 45 doubles, 23 stolen bases\n2015: 137 games, .310/.379/.480 slash line, 15 home runs, 84, RBIs, 45 doubles, 15 stolen bases\nThis year, he said, he also found his voice in the clubhouse.\nWhen the Indians dealt away Brandon Moss, David Murphy, Nick Swisher and Michael Bourn in late July and early August, manager Terry Francona and general manager Chris Antonetti met with the club's new de facto leaders: Brantley, Jason Kipnis and Corey Kluber. The team's core was now in charge of aiding a new wave of young players.\nFor the first time in his career, Brantley had this extra responsibility.\n\"He's always been a really good player, a really good teammate and [was] probably trying to figure out where he falls as far as the leadership goes,\" Francona said. \"Because he's so respectful that he's probably thinking, 'I'm not that guy yet. I shouldn't be that guy.' But as he's looking around and we're encouraging him, I think he did understand that, 'It's OK for me to do that.' I think he grew into that this year by his own admission. He did a good job.\"\nThat was a challenge for a guy who hasn't always been vocal in the dugout.\n\"I'm pretty quiet,\" Brantley said. \"They make fun of me because I don't smile too much in the dugout. I'm really focused. When I'm in the field, I try to zone in and try to get to a bit of a different mindset. Sometimes I need to talk a little more to make sure I'm helping out my teammates, if I see something, a pitcher or a situation that's coming up, just to make sure that we're all on the same page.\n\"I have a voice. I have an obligation to make sure that we're going out there ready to go and we're prepared as a team.\"\nLast week, Brantley pulled aside Francisco Lindor after the rookie shortstop failed to advance on a poor throw at Target Field. Francona took notice and later praised the 28-year-old left fielder for taking initiative with his inexperienced teammate.\n\"I just want to be the best teammate I can to everybody,\" Brantley said. \"Any questions they have, or [if] I have to pick up a teammate, whatever I have to do at that time, that's what I'm there for. I think that's what leadership and a leader does for the team.\"\nBrantley will man that role while serving as an observer for the final weekend of the season. He doesn't anticipate needing to undergo surgery for his shoulder. He received a cortisone shot earlier in the week and has a two-week rehab plan written down. The Indians will build him back up to full strength to ensure that he can begin his offseason at full strength and arrive in Goodyear in February without any maladies.\n\"I played through a couple things [this year], but at the same time, you have to block that out mentally,\" Brantley said. \"You have to stay mentally tough and just keep grinding away. You have to be out there with your team as much as possible. That's the most important thing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:20:42.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
