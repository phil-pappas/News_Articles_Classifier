After all, a 300-pound defensive tackle about to lunge at you begs for attention.\nBut as a senior, Aiono often finds his eyes drifting.\n\"Sometimes I don't even look D-line,\" he said. \"The secondary tells the whole story.\"\nSafeties tell where the blitz is coming from. If Aiono can't glean anything from the safeties, then his eyes move up: What are the linebackers doing? Are they tilting? Are they covering for blitzers? The defensive line is last in the progression, and by that time, Aiono usually knows what is about to happen.\n  \"It's like reading a book,\" he said. \"That's why I love center, because it made me see football from a whole different perspective.\"\nUtah's offense is far from perfect, but it has done a few things very well: Giving creases for Devontae Booker and keeping Travis Wilson and Kendal Thompson clean in the pocket. The Utes have the No. 24 rushing offense nationally (216.2 ypg) and are No. 4 in fewest sacks allowed with only two thus far.\nThe difference is perspective â€” specifically the perspective that comes from having the same offensive line coach and the same offense as last season. This fall is the first time these offensive linemen have been allowed to build off the offensive terminology and scheme they already know.\nIt's made a world of difference: Instead of figuring out who to block, they're fine-tuning how they block.\n\"I remember this time last year, we're barely getting in the groove of the offense we learned in spring,\" Aiono said. \"But this time, we come in, we knew the plays already. We're just thinking about playing ball.\"\nA lot of that confidence comes from Aiono, who teammates say is tireless in the film room. He doesn't dedicate a specific number of hours per se, just until \"I feel comfortable.\" He reviews full games, then specific plays that Utah might run, how teams react, what personnel they'll use, and on and on.\nA center's most important job is picking up blitzes. His instructions radiate to the guards, then the tackles. Travis Wilson has the power to trump Aiono in Utah's offense, and he sometimes has to great success. But most of the time, the offense is relying on Aiono's eyes.\n\"Anytime we have a protection, we're trying to do the best we can to put our offensive linemen on their most dangerous blitz threats,\" offensive co-coordinator and line coach Jim Harding said. \"He spends a lot of time on his own and takes pride in making sure we slide the right way. And because of that, he's put us in a lot of good positions so far this year.\"\nOne of Utah's surprising early struggles this year was in the run game: After the Utes mauled through several defenses last year with Devontae Booker, Michigan kicked off the season bottling them up for only 127 yards on the ground.\nThat's improved week-by-week, to the Utes rolling up 265 yards last week against Cal. It helps to have a Heisman dark horse in Booker.\n\"You know, Book is Book,\" J.J. Dielman said. \"He's gonna run hard, he's run over people, run through people, jump over people. And if we open the holes for him, he's gonna get every yard that there is to get.\"\nBooker also gets credit in the passing game, where he's improved as a blocker. Said Harding: \"He isn't a guy who takes that lightly.\"\nAgainst Arizona State this week, Utah may face its toughest challenge yet. Dielman estimates the Sun Devils blitz 70 percent of the time. Their pressure shook Wilson in 2014 when he managed only 57 passing yards and was sacked three times.\n\"It's extremely frustrating because I've watched that game more than once,\" Dielman said. \"That's not the offense we are, and that's not the offense we certainly are this season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:13:10.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
