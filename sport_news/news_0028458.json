That's right, No. 7, directly ahead of Alabama, Michigan State, Florida and Notre Dame.\nWhile the official ranking turned out to be a mite lower — No. 18 — how wondrous and surreal is that? In the words of Justin Timberlake, speaking for Memphians everywhere at the Memphis Music Hall of Fame event Saturday night: \"We got a damn team.\"\nMemphis got a team ranked in the Top 25 for just the third time. Memphis got a team ranked higher than No. 25 in the AP Poll for the first time. Memphis got a team that could very well wind up in a New Year's bowl game.\nSo let me take this opportunity to urge all of you who follow this football program to bask in the moment like you have never basked before. That's right, bask. Fans of other schools do it all the time. The dictionary definition: \"to revel in and make the most of something.\" Synonyms: \"delight in, luxuriate in, wallow in, take pleasure in, rejoice in, glory in, indulge oneself in.\"\nYou should definitely do all of those things, too.\nYou should delight in the memories of that spectacular 37-24 win over Ole Miss on Saturday at the Liberty Bowl.\nYou should luxuriate in the sight of the old stadium, filled to the very top, almost exclusively with people who have suffered along with you over the years.\nYou should wallow in all the national attention the team is getting.\nYou should take pleasure in the Bleacher Report story that proclaims Memphis \"College Football's New Darling.\"\nYou should rejoice in the part of that story that says \"Memphis and coach Justin Fuente are 6-0 and represent a story that anyone with a heart can get behind.\"\nYou should glory in the piece over at SI.com that says that \"Memphis has become a dark-horse playoff threat.\"\nYou should indulge yourself in all of it, the moment, the memories, the attention, and the dreams of what could happen next.\nAnd yes, I absolutely understand it could all end Friday night when Memphis plays Tulsa. I am keenly aware of the history of this program after big wins. After beating Tennessee in 1996, Memphis lost the next game to East Carolina. After beating Southern California in 1991, Memphis was shut out in the next game by Ole Miss. After beating Florida in 1988, Memphis lost the next two, to Tennessee and Southern Miss. I know all that. I also appreciate that Tulsa is a tricky matchup for Memphis, because it averages 40 passes a game.\nSo, by all means, Fuente should take all necessary measures to forbid his team from joining in the community celebration. That can wait until the end of the year. But for the rest of you?\nThis is the very best part of being a sports fan. This is a team on its way up. This is triumph before it is expected and/or taken for granted. This is how Ole Miss fans felt just a year ago, after beating Alabama at home.\nFeelings this good are fleeting, almost by definition. You can't be college football's new darling more than once. With success come heightened expectations and other perils. Ask Ole Miss fans how quickly it can turn.\nBut don't let any of that get in the way of your current happiness. And don't let your friends try to depress you by saying that Justin Fuente might leave.\nOf course he might leave. Does anyone consider that a news flash? He was considered one of the bright young coaches in the country well before the win over Ole Miss.\nBut what part of that should diminish the sight of hundreds of Memphians spilling onto the football field, to celebrate with their team? What part of that can ruin what could be the most perfect Memphis football moment that has ever been?\nIt was at that Memphis Music Hall of Fame ceremony. Timberlake explained that he had watched the game on TV. And then he led the crowd, the whole crowd, in a rousing rendition of the Memphis fight song. I know more than one Memphis fan who watched it — or sang along — in tears.\nSo, no, all may not remain this perfectly wonderful forever. What part of life ever does? The key is basking in the good stuff when you find yourself in the midst of it.
