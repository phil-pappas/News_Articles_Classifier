According to Vic Carucci of the Buffalo News , Harvin is considering retirement because of his injured hip. Shortly after that report became public, Adam Schefter of ESPN reported that Harvin is not considering retiring and is just frustrated with the injury, as well as a knee injury.\nAt his Thursday news conference from the Bills' temporary facility in England, Ryan said he has \"no idea\" where Harvin is at the moment. All he would say is that Harvin won't play against the Jaguars on Sunday.\n\"I'm not going to say anymore on him than yesterday because I don't know where he is right now,\" Ryan said.\nHarvin has been dealing with the hip injury off and on since training camp and missed the Bills' Week 6 game because of it. The Bills are also without wide receiver Sammy Watkins, who injured his ankle against the Bengals in Week 6.\nHarvin has a three-year contract, the second two years of which is voidable. The Bills are paying him $6 million for 2015, and he has caught 19 passes for 219 yards and a touchdown in five games.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/viccarucci/status/657174662598774784", "https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/657179009747283968"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:42:29.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
