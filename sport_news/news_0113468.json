West title, with Adrian Beltre's three-run double backing Derek Holland in a 5-3 victory over the Los Angeles Angels. The Rangers, in the playoffs for the first time since 2012 after a 95-loss season, are a win or a Houston loss away from their first division title since winning two straight and going to the World Series in 2010-11. The Angels still have a shot at the second wild card. Los Angeles is a game behind the Astros and tied with Minnesota. \nThe New York Yankees clinched a wild-card berth, ending a two-year absence from the postseason by beating the Boston Red Sox 4-1 for the franchise's 10,000th regular-season win. Carlos Beltran homered along with rookies Greg Bird and Rob Refsnyder. CC Sabathia won for the second time since the All-Star break. Twins 4, Indians 2: Pinch-runner Eduardo Nunez scored from third base on a wild pitch and Torii Hunter hit a sacrifice fly in the ninth inning to help Minnesota pull within one game of idle Houston for the second A.L. wild-card berth. Advertisement Cubs 5, Reds 3: Austin Jackson hit a three-run homer, Anthony Rizzo added an RBI double and Chicago kept alive its slim hopes for home-field advantage in the wild-card game. Pittsburgh leads the Cubs by two games. Cincinnati has lost 12 straight overall, matching the 1993 team for the franchise's longest losing streak in 70 years. Joey Votto's seventh-inning RBI single extended to 47 his streak of consecutive games in which he has reached base at least once, the longest since Kevin Millar's 52-game stretch in 2007. Phillies 3, Mets 0: Jerad Eickhoff struck out 10 in seven dominant innings, Darin Ruf hit a two-run homer and Philadelphia completed a three-game sweep. New York is tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for home-field advantage in the division series and holds the tiebreaker. -- ASSOCIATED PRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:46:50.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
