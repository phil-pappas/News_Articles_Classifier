That year, the Royals won a seven-game ALCS, taking the finale at the old Exhibition Stadium. Much has been made of the 2015 Blue Jays ending the longest playoff drought in pro sports (22 years). But just last year, the Royals held that same distinction before snapping a 29-year non-playoff skid. They fell one victory short of winning the World Series. The Royals have hometown advantage (four home games to the Blue Jays’ three) after finishing two wins ahead of Toronto in the regular season. Toronto had the edge in the final week, but slipped after clinching the AL East, while the Royals won their final five games. The Royals are known for their team speed. Lorenzo Cain and Jarrod Dyson both finished in the top 15 in the majors in stolen bases, and the Royals are equally dangerous on defence because of their fleet feet. The Royals and Blue Jays both acquired a big-name starting pitcher at the deadline — and both Toronto’s David Price and Kansas City’s Johnny Cueto are pending free agents. Cueto was mostly disappointing for the Royals during the regular season, but was excellent in a Game 5 playoff win over the Houston Astros. Price, conversely, was outstanding in the regular season, but hasn’t been nearly as sharp in the playoffs. The teams played a nasty game on Aug. 2 at the Rogers Centre. A near brawl erupted after Jays reliever Aaron Sanchez was ejected for hitting Royals shortstop Alcides Escobar on the leg with a pitch. Earlier, Royals starter Edinson Volquez hit Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson with a pitch, leading to warnings to both benches. Afterward, Volquez called Donaldson “a little baby.” Donaldson has a very good shot to be named American League MVP in his first season in Toronto. He was acquired in an off-season deal with Oakland as Toronto sent Canadian third baseman Brett Lawrie and three prospects to the A’s. Oakland was one of the worst teams in baseball this year. Toronto was not. Game 5 hero Jose Bautista came to the Jays in what was thought to be a minor deal in 2008, with Toronto sending a player to be named later to the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Jays were Bautista’s fifth big-league organization and he did little of note during his first four years in MLB, 2004-2007. Since 2010, however, he’s been an all-star every year. The Blue Jays were a pedestrian 50-50 this year before making a blockbuster deal for Colorado Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki in mid-July. While Tulowitzki has been inconsistent offensively and was injured in September, his defence provided a steadying influence as Toronto roared to the finish, coming in at 93-69. The trade for Tulowitzki just before the deadline also led to several other big moves, including the Price deal. While Jays GM Alex Anthopoulos received well-deserved praise for his trade deadline moves, the three pitchers who combined for the Game 5 win are all young players developed in the Jays system — Marcus Stroman, Aaron Sanchez and Roberto Osuna, the youngest player in the majors at age 20. Blue Jays fans will be very familiar with Royals starting right fielder Alex Rios. The Jays made him their first-round pick in 1999 and he played from 2004-09 in Toronto. Cheapest ticket for a pair of seats for Game 1 in Kansas City as of Thursday afternoon was US$134.99 each on StubHub. For the first home game in Toronto (Game 3), it was US$170. Kansas City’s Kauffman Stadium does not have a roof like Rogers Centre, but the weather looks good the next two days. Friday’s high is 17C with no rain in the forecast, while Saturday’s high is 15C with only a 20% chance of rain. Game 1 Blue Jays starter Marco Estrada gave up the most home runs in the National League last year — 29 as a Milwaukee Brewer. This year has been a totally different story. He was 13-8 with a 3.13 ERA in the regular season and picked up the Jays’ first playoff win with a strong performance in Game 3 vs. Texas. The Royals swing away. They recorded the fewest walks and fewest strikeouts in the American League this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:07:09.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
