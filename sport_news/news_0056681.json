(AP) — Ezekiel Elliott did everything he could to keep Ohio State's winning streak going. It still took a final goal-line stand for the top-ranked Buckeyes to hold off Indiana.And now, Ohio State's grip on the No. 1 ranking could be slipping after its 34-27 victory over the Hoosiers on Saturday.Elliott had an electrifying second half with touchdown runs of 55, 65 and 75 yards and finished with a career-best 274 yards to help the Buckeyes narrowly win their 18th in a row — the longest active streak in the FBS.Nothing came easy for Ohio State (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten). Especially at the end, when Buckeyes cornerback Eli Apple batted away a desperation pass in the back of the end zone as time expired.From the start, the game was full of surprises. Indiana (4-1, 0-1) gambled twice on fourth down in the first half — including a fake punt from its 16 that failed. Ohio State fumbled four times and wound up with three turnovers and eight major penalties.The teams combined for four scoring runs — three from Elliott — that went for more than 50 yards during a 13-minute stretch in the second half.The Buckeyes also extended their Big Ten regular-season record streak to 25 in a row — and could tie Oklahoma for the most weeks ranked No. 1 (101), if they can hold onto it.Cardale Jones finished 18 of 27 with 245 yard with one TD and one interception.NO. 25 FLORIDA 38, NO. 3 MISSISSIPPI 10GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Will Grier threw four touchdown passes to four receivers — all in the first half — and Florida upset Mississippi to give coach Jim McElwain a signature win in his first season in Gainesville.The redshirt freshman battled a stomach virus for two days before the game — feeling so ill that the Gators (5-0, 3-0) thought there was a chance Treon Harris might get the nod — but Grier started anyway and was sharper than ever.Grier was sick all right.He was downright nasty against the Rebels (4-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference).He completed 24 of 29 passes for 271 yards. He was poised in the pocket, precise with every throw and even closer to perfect than he was down the stretch against Tennessee last week.McElwain, meanwhile, became the first Florida coach since Steve Spurrier in 1990 to open his first season 5-0.NO. 12 CLEMSON 24, NO. 6 NOTRE DAME 22CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — Deshaun Watson threw two touchdowns pass and ran for a score, and Clemson stopped DeShone Kizer on a tying 2-point conversion to help the Tigers hold off Notre Dame.Tigers linebacker B.J. Goodson had an interception and a fumble recovery to halt two fourth-quarter drives by the Fighting Irish (4-1). But the biggest stop was by defensive tackle Carlos Watkins, who brought down Kizer short of the goal line with 7 seconds left.Kizer rallied Notre Dame from 21-3 down in the second half with two touchdown passes, the last a 1-yard toss to Torii Hunter Jr.Clemson secured Notre Dame's onside kick and closed out the victory, moving to 4-0 for fourth time in five years.NO. 13 ALABAMA 38, NO. 8 GEORGIA 10ATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Jake Coker ran the offense to perfection, the defense turned in a dominating performance, and No. 13 Alabama even got a touchdown from its special teams in a rout of Georgia that re-established the Crimson Tide as a force in the national race.Coming of a home loss to Mississippi two weeks ago, Alabama (4-1, 1-1 Southeastern) jumped ahead 24-3 at halftime and iced the victory on Georgia's first offensive play of the second half. Eddie Jackson intercepted Brice Ramsey's pass and returned it 50 yards for a touchdown.Coker, with an assist from Lane Kiffin's play-calling, completed 11 of 16 for 190 yards, passed for one touchdown, and ran for another. Derrick Henry rushed for 148 yards and scored on a 30-yard run that put Alabama ahead to stay midway through the second quarter.Georgia (4-1, 2-1) yanked starting quarterback Greyson Lambert late in the first half, but it didn't matter. He even went back in after Ramsey threw his second interception.ARIZONA STATE 38, NO. 7 UCLA 23PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Mike Bercovici passed for 273 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score, and Arizona State got its season back on track with a victory over UCLA.Tim White and D.J. Foster caught scoring passes for the Sun Devils (3-2, 1-1 Pac-12), who responded to their dire situation after two September losses with a solid effort in their second straight win at the Rose Bowl. Arizona State built a 29-10 lead heading into the fourth quarter and then hung on.Thomas Duarte caught his second touchdown pass from Josh Rosen with 9:19 to play, trimming the Sun Devils' lead to 29-23. But after UCLA (4-1, 1-1) got stranded inside its 1 by Matt Haack's punt, the Bruins snapped the ball out of their own end zone with 4:16 left for their second safety of the night.Kalen Ballage wrapped it up with a 23-yard TD run with 45 seconds to play, covering most of that distance with UCLA defenders hanging on him.Arizona State's defense rebounded splendidly after giving up 42 points in a home loss to Southern California last week.NO. 2 MICHIGAN STATE 24, PURDUE 21EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — LJ Scott ran for 146 yards and two touchdowns, and Michigan State held on through a lackluster second half.The Spartans (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) led 21-0 at halftime, but Purdue had the ball near midfield with a chance to tie or take the lead before David Blough threw incomplete on fourth down with about a minute to play in the game. The Boilermakers (1-4, 0-1) turned the ball over three times in the first half.Michigan State's Connor Cook went 13 of 19 for 139 yards and a touchdown, and became the school's career leader with his 28th victory as the starting quarterback. Kirk Cousins won 27 games.Cook improved to 28-3 as the starter.NO. 4 TCU 50, TEXAS 7FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Trevone Boykin threw five touchdown passes, including four to freshman KaVontae Turpin, and TCU rode a 30-point first quarter to a second straight rout of Texas.Josh Doctson broke the TCU record for receiving TDs with a pair of scores and the Horned Frogs (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) won their 13th straight game, second nationally to Ohio State's 18-game run.The Longhorns (1-4, 0-2), plagued by special teams mistakes for the third straight game, scored a late touchdown to avoid matching the second-worst shutout loss in school history — 50-0 to Oklahoma 107 years ago. They are off to their worst start since going 1-9 in 1956.TCU beat Texas in consecutive years for the first time since 1958-59, outscoring the Longhorns 98-17.Boykin threw for 332 yards without playing in the fourth quarter, and his 74 career TD passes are three more than Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton had from 2007-10.NO. 5 BAYLOR 63, TEXAS TECH 35ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Seth Russell passed for 286 yards and four touchdowns and ran for two more scores, Shock Linwood ran for a career-high 221 yards and two touchdowns and Baylor began its pursuit of a third consecutive Big 12 championship with a victory over Texas Tech.Baylor (4-0, 1-0) entered with the FBS' top offense in scoring (64.0 points per game), total offense (767.0 yards per game) and rushing yards (379.7 per game). The Bears gained 680 yards, 368 rushing.Corey Coleman caught touchdown passes of 24, 16 and 16 yards.Russell was 15 for 23 with one interception.The Red Raiders (3-2, 0-2) dropped their second straight game after sweeping their nonconference opponents. They lost 55-52 to No. 4 TCU last week.NO. 9 LSU 44, EASTERN MICHIGAN 22BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Leonard Fournette highlighted his third straight 200-yard game with a 75-yard touchdown run, and LSU beat Eastern Michigan.Fournette had 233 yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries to remain among the top contenders for the Heisman Trophy. He also became the first player in the history of the Southeastern Conference to rush for 200-plus yards in three straight games.But some might have expected even more from the 6-foot-1, 230-pound sophomore against the Eagles (1-4), who came in allowing a nation's-worst 373.2 yards rushing per game.The Eagles stacked their defense to stop the run, but the Tigers (4-0) struggled to cash in through the air. LSU quarterback Brandon Harris was 4 of 15 for 80 yards with one interception.NO. 11 FLORIDA STATE 24, WAKE FOREST 16WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — Dalvin Cook had a 94-yard touchdown run before leaving with a left leg injury, and Florida State held on to beat Wake Forest.Johnathan Vickers added a 9-yard touchdown run and Everett Golson was 20 of 31 for 202 yards with a 5-yard scoring pass to Kermit Whitfield.Roberto Aguayo added a 25-yard field goal for the Seminoles (4-0, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference).Freshman Kendall Hinton was 27 of 42 for 215 yards against the nation's No. 4 pass defense with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Cam Serigne.Mike Weaver kicked three field goals for the Demon Deacons (2-3, 0-2), including a 29-yarder with 3:34 left that pulled them within eight.Wake Forest got the ball back with 1:42 left and reached the Florida State 20 before Hinton overthrew Serigne in the end zone and a diving Tyler Hunter intercepted it with 21 seconds left.NO. 14 TEXAS A&M 30, NO. 21 MISSISSIPPI STATE 17COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) — Kyle Allen threw for 322 yards and two touchdowns to help Texas A&M remain undefeated with a victory over Mississippi State.The Aggies (5-0, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) led by 14 at halftime.
