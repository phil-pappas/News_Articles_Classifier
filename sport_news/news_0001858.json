Hisashi Iwakuma will start Friday, Roenis Elias on Saturday and Vidal Nuno will pitch the season finale Sunday. \nMcClendon said he would have changed his thinking if the Mariners were facing a team that was in a playoff chase or Hernandez had a chance for a career-best 20th victory. Hernandez missed out on win No. 19 last Saturday against the Los Angeles Angels. \nHernandez will finish the season with an 18-9 record and 3.53 ERA. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:14:27.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
