Fajardo was undrafted but spent training camp with the Oakland Raiders. He was a training camp cut and has had tryouts with the Jaguars and the Giants in recent weeks before signing with the CFL team. \nFajardo started for four seasons at Nevada and led the Wolf Pack to three bowl games. He became the second player in NCAA history to throw for at least 9,000 yards and rush for at least 3,000 yards in a career. The other was his predecessor, Colin Kaepernick. \nToronto is 9-5 this season and their quarterback is Trevor Harris, who has completed 72.1 percent of his passes for 3,782 yards, 31 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. Toronto has four games remaining in the regular season.
