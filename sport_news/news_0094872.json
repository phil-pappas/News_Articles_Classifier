What, do you want him to run out of bounds?” \nThat was Alabama coach Nick Saban’s response when asked what he’s thinking when Crimson Tide quarterback Jake Coker is scrambling around and lowering his shoulder into defenders. \nIn the fourth quarter of Alabama’s 41-23 win at Texas A&M on Saturday, Coker took off on a scramble. But toward the end of the play, Coker dropped his throwing shoulder into the chest of Texas A&M defensive back Nick Harvey, knocking him back before falling out of bounds. \n“At that time there was really nowhere else to go,” Coker said. “I saw him, and I had no other thought than to go forward.” \nThe result of the play was a 16-yard gain. Saban was impressed with Coker’s toughness on the run. While he wishes Coker wouldn’t take so many hits, Saban said he does like to see the opposing team’s reaction to Coker making plays with his feet. Coker has two rushing touchdowns on the season. \n“I kind of like it when he runs over them,” Saban said. “It’s the personality of the player. Jake’s a tough, competitive guy. He’s a big, physical guy. He’s getting better and better every week. I don’t want to take his aggressiveness away because we’re fearful something bad is going to happen. I just don't coach that way.” \nAt 6-foot-5, 232 pounds, Coker runs like he is trapped in a pinball machine as defenders routinely bounce off of him. \nCoker’s scrambling has earned him several nicknames including “Baby Roethlisberger” after Pittsburgh Steelers’ quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Coker said all of the nicknames are “getting out of hand.” \nLike Roethlisberger, Coker has proved to be a tough guy to bring down on the field. \nHe moves in the pocket well to avoid sacks, and hasn’t been hesitant to take off to pick up yardage. Coker said he tried to slide once against Georgia, but remembers it being a “disaster of a slide attempt.” \nThe toughness Coker has showed is just one of many ways he’s been able to win over the team since completely taking over the starting job. Tide linebacker Reggie Ragland said the team loves it when Coker takes off running. \n“Any time he does that, that gets guys on the team hyped up,” Ragland said. “We’re backed up third-and-10 and he gets the first down, the guys on the sideline see that and get hyped up more and more. The guys in the locker room love it.” \n(8) ALABAMA VS.
