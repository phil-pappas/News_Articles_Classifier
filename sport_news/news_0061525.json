They clinched a post-season berth last week, but defensive end Ricky Foley said hardly anybody noticed.\nAll people want to talk about is the embarrassing turnout of 3,401 fans announced at Tim Hortons Field last week.\n“Does anybody get that?” Foley said, crediting general manager Jim Barker and head coach Scott Milanovich for their sound personnel decisions and delicate managerial style in avoiding disaster.\n“We’ve had 14 new starters this season and we’ve played four games in 17 days. This could have been a terrible year.”\nFoley admitted “I was mad” about the relocated games, four in all so far. The latest is Friday when the Argos return to Hamilton in a big-stakes “home” clash with the Montreal Alouettes.\nFoley has learned to accept these difficult times.\n“They can come here (Downsview Park) if they want,” the Toronto native said defiantly.\nFoley can remember some small crowds at York University, where he could often hear his parents yelling from the stands.\nMilanovich was asked when he’s played before a smaller crowd. He thought back to his days in midget ball in Butler, Pa. Even in high school, he saw crowds of 7,000.\nWith little fan support, the Argos (9-6) will have to manufacture their own intensity against the Alouettes (5-10), who are playing for their playoff lives.\nToronto will have receiver Kevin Elliott back after he missed the last game to attend the funeral of his grandmother.\nSeveral Argos are making their debut.\nAmerican Jake Rogers, who will be the ninth kicker the team has employed this season, will handle the punting.\nThe offensive line will have two new faces in Fouimalo Fonoti at right guard and Rishaw Johnson at right tackle. They replace Greg Van Roten and Chris Van Zeyl.\nVan Roten came up limping this week after an on-field fight with defensive lineman Euclid Cummings at practice. An angry Milanovich gave the team a dressing down later at mid-field.\nDespite this incident, Milanovich said there is a good feeling in the dressing room and players have each other’s backs.\nMilanovich also came to the defence of quarterback Trevor Harris, the first-year starter who threw three interceptions last week.\n“A week ago, we were all talking about him being the leading candidate for the MOP (most outstanding player in the league), and now everyone wants him replaced,” the coach said.\nMilanovich was reacting to suggestions that, with a playoff position clinched, the Argos should give Ricky Ray some live action. But Milanovich has told Harris that he has faith in him.\nRay turned 36 on Thursday and players gathered around to sing him “Happy Birthday” on the field.\nRay’s days in Toronto may be nearing an end. Both Harris and Ray are free agents after the season, and it’s clearly looking like Ray will be gone, perhaps to a team with real QB needs like Montreal.\n-\nTrevor Harris, while leading the league with 32 passing touchdowns, also leads the CFL with 17 interceptions. He has thrown an interception in eight straight games. Here’s a look at what happened on the next drive after the interception in his last four games (10 picks):\nOct. 17 vs. Calgary Stampeders.\nFirst quarter: 48-yard return, Calgary gets TD on next play\nThird quarter: 10-yard return, Calgary gets field goal on next series\nFourth quarter: No return. Calgary concedes safety on next series\n-\nOct. 12 in Montreal\nSecond quarter : 21-yard return, Montreal gets field goal on next series\n-\nOct. 6 in Ottawa\nFirst quarter: No return, Ottawa gets field goal on next series.\nFirst quarter: 23-yard return, Ottawa gets field goal on next series\n-\nSept. 26 in Ottawa\nFirst quarter: 40-yard return for a TD\nThird quarter: 6-yard return, Ottawa gets field goal on next series\n-\nSept. 11 vs. Hamilton\nFirst quarter: 15-yard return, Hamilton scores TD on next play\nFourth quarter: No return. Hamilton doesn’t score on next series\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:23:20.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
