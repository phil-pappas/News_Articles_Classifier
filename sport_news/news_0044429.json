(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) \nKris Humphries sat in front of his locker at Verizon Center Tuesday night with bags of ice wrapping both of his legs minutes after he debuted in his new role with the Washington Wizards. \nHumphries had just performed in a regulation basketball game like he never had before. He spent nearly 20 minutes on the floor lurking at the three-point line on the offensive end, not hesitating to shoot from there. It was a shockingly strange experience for a 6-foot-9 bruiser who has spent essentially all of his basketball career patrolling inside the arc. \n“After three minutes, I was like, ‘I don’t know,’ ” the 11-year NBA veteran joked with a teammate. \nThe doubt didn’t stem from his altered offensive identity, that from rebounding specialist to stretch-four. He is comfortable shooting threes. The apprehension was induced by the non-stop sprinting packaged with the role in the Wizards’ new offense. Not only did Humphries have to dash to his spot in the four-out, one-in system, he also was responsible for crashing the glass at both ends as the power forward. The relentless running was tiring. \n“I got to be in better shape, to take what I showed I do last year and then add the three-ball to it,” said Humphries, who started Tuesday. “You’re further out, so as far as offensive rebounding, that’s a run in and a run out. And then you’re running back and then you got to set your feet and have your breath together and shoot it. It’s different. I’m still getting used to it.” \nHumphries went 2 for 26 from three-point range over his first 11 NBA seasons but is ready to assume the three-point shooting burden. He began focusing on improving his three-point accuracy at the end of last season, when he found himself out of the rotation following a groin injury, at the behest of the Wizards’ player development staff. Over the summer he then made a commitment to shoot every morning and every night Monday through Friday while also maintaining his usual offseason training regimen of pilates, weightlifting and conditioning. \n“I haven’t really worked on shooting threes, like really worked on it, ever,” Humphries, 30, said. “Other than maybe college and stuff but that’s a close three. Now I’ve got to adapt to what we’re trying to do and get in better shape.” \nThe work was evident Tuesday. After missing his first two three-pointers, he converted his next two to finish 2 for 4 and later added an effective drive to the basket from the three-point line that concluded with a dish to Marcin Gortat at the basket. \n“He scared the [expletive] out of me in the first half,” Coach Randy Wittman joked after the game. “No, I thought he did fine. It’s different. He’s never played that way before. I thought he did fine. Again, he got tired. And it’s not the take the ball out, walk it down, get yourself on the block, which is different for him.” \nFor Humphries, figuring out where to position himself and when to cut to the basket for passes are also hurdles. The chief hurdle will be conditioning. He emphasized he is not out of shape by his usual standards, but his usual standards no longer apply. It will take time and a few more grueling practices. \n“I expect myself to get better. It’ll be easier the better shape I get in,” Humphries said. “It’s one thing to shoot the shot, but it’s another thing to run, run, run, and then shoot it.” Jorge Castillo writes about the Washington Wizards. sports Success!
