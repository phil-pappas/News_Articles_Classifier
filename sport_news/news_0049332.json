Just like our marathon on Friday, we've got an all-day affair beginning shortly after lunch time in the Eastern time zone and before lunch by the time we get out West. Ready? If not, get ready ASAP. It's coming.\nLet's give this thing a quick once-over with items of note in chronological order.\nALDS Royals - Astros , Game 4. 1:07 p.m. ET. Fox Sports One \nAstros lead 2-1 \nPitching matchup: Yordano Ventura (13-8, 4.08) vs. Lance McCullers (6-7, 3.22) \n\nDue to a rain delay, Ventura only worked two innings in Game 1 and that enables him to come back on short rest without the Royals giving it a second thought. The Astros touched him up for three runs in those two innings, though, so it's not exactly like the Royals can feel as confident as the Astros probably did with Dallas Keuchel in Game 3.\n\nYordano Ventura comes back on short rest in Game 4. (USATSI) \n\nMcCullers getting the ball here is fun, too, since he's a rookie and obviously has never made a postseason start. He saw the Royals once this season, a start in Minute Maid Park where he allowed only one run on four hits in seven innings.\nThe significant storyline here is that last year the Royals never faced elimination until Game 6 of the World Series. Now they need to win two straight to avoid the early exit after winning 95 regular-season games.\nALDS Blue Jays - Rangers , Game 4. 4:07 p.m. ET. Fox Sports One \nRangers lead 2-1 \nPitching matchup: R.A. Dickey (11-11, 3.91) vs. Derek Holland (4-3, 4.91)\nThe Blue Jays' backs remain against the wall, as they look to win a second straight road game in order to get this thing back to Toronto for a winner-take-all Game 5. Though there was some discussion about David Price possibly coming back on short rest, the Jays appear set to run with Dickey, though surely his leash will be short.\nOn the bright side for Jays fans, Dickey has fared well for most of the past several weeks. During September, he was 2-1 with a 2.43 ERA. He allowed two or fewer runs in five of his six starts.\nHolland had a 7.62 ERA in his last five starts, but he's capable of going out and dominating on any given day. He has eight career shutouts in 138 regular season starts. He's shown he can put his team on his back in the postseason, too, as he worked 8 1/3 scoreless innings in Game 4 of the 2011 World Series to help those Rangers even things up at 2-2 against St. Louis.\nNLDS Cardinals - Cubs , Game 3. 6:07 p.m. ET. TBS \nSeries tied, 1-1 \nPitching matchup: Michael Wacha (17-7, 3.38) vs. Jake Arrieta (22-6, 1.77)\n\nJake Arrieta takes the hill for the Cubs in Game 3. (USATSI) \n\nThe Cubs are here thanks in part to Arrieta's sheer dominance all season, including the Wild Card. We can't expect him to be this close to perfect every time out, so the Cardinals will be counting on this being the time he falters, much like they were with Clayton Kershaw last season. In four regular-season starts against St. Louis, Arrieta was 2-1 with a 2.42 ERA, though none of those starts came in the second half.\nThe Cardinals counter with Wacha, who had a very good season but a terrible September (7.88 ERA in five starts). In four starts against the Cubs, he was 1-2 with a 6.86 ERA.\nThe Cubs need Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo to get going, as neither has a hit this postseason. Bryant hit .311/.408/.629 with 21 homers in Wrigley Field this season, so it might be as simple as returning home.\nNLDS Dodgers - Mets , Game 3. 8:07 p.m. ET. TBS \nSeries tied, 1-1 \nPitching matchup: Brett Anderson (10-9, 3.69) vs. Matt Harvey (13-8, 2.71)\nAll the talk leading up to the game will revolve around Chase Utley taking out Ruben Tejada at second base in Game 2. There will be much discussion on whether or not the Mets will retaliate by throwing at Utley or someone else ( Adrian Gonzalez ? He's the Dodgers' best hitter), but the hunch is they won't do anything. \nWe also have Harvey, of course, who made headlines with the whole innings limit discussion and then by missing a mandatory workout last week. It's his first career postseason start. When he's on, he's as good as anyone. He's only made three starts since Sept. 8, but has posted a 1.02 ERA in those games. with 24 strikeouts in 17 2/3 innings. If he's not efficient with his pitches, the bullpen will get in a lot of work. Overall, he was much better at home (8-3, 2.23 ERA) than on the road (5-5, 3.42).\nAs for Anderson, his only previous postseason start resulted in a win after six scoreless innings back in 2012 against Detroit. Last time he took the ball this season, he had a very good outing against San Francisco, but in his previous two outings he was shelled.\nAnderson has never started a game in Citi Field. He was, however, much better on the road (7-4, 3.07) than at home (3-5, 4.29) this season.\nTopics: Adrian Gonzalez , Anthony Rizzo , Brett Anderson , Chase Utley , Dallas Keuchel , David Price , Derek Holland , Jake Arrieta , Kris Bryant , Lance McCullers , Matt Harvey , Michael Wacha , R.A.
