Given the teams’ past – and at this point there is no need to rehash the circumstances surrounding that NFL soap opera we’ve come to know as Deflategate – does Sunday night’s game take on added meaning? Nope. It’s just another game. If you heard it once in the Patriots’ locker room at Gillette Stadium on Wednesday, you could have heard it 53 times, once from each of the 53 players on the team’s active roster. (Insert script here:) “We’re just focused on the Colts,” running back LeGarrette Blount said. “We’re not worried about anything that happened in the offseason. We’re just focused on trying to watch the Colts and seeing what we can do to beat them.” “I’m always pretty motivated regardless of the opponent, regardless of the team or the week, whether that’s a preseason game or whether that’s a regular-season game,” quarterback Tom Brady, the central figure in the Deflategate investigation, answered when asked if he might have some added incentive this weekend. “They’re all important because there’s so few of those you get an opportunity in your life, so I don’t take them for granted.” You didn’t expect the Patriots to go all “Buffalo Bills” on the Colts this week, did you? As you’ll no doubt recall, in the days leading up to last month’s game with their AFC East rivals, the Bills had one player brazenly say “don’t nobody like the Patriots” (defensive tackle Marcell Dareus) and another (safety Aaron Williams) explain that his disdain was based on “the way they carry themselves on the field and stuff.” The Bills’ candor may have been commendable, but their performance, eh, not so much. Talking a far better game than they played, the Bills fell 24 points behind the Patriots at home and lost, 40-32. You’ll see a Vince Lombardi Trophy in a trophy case at Ralph Wilson Stadium before you read or hear an incendiary quote coming out of Gillette. As you may have noticed over the past decade and a half under Bill Belichick, the Patriots have built a culture that is more about game-day highlights than weekday sound bites. And so the mantra heard around the locker room in Foxboro on Wednesday was every bit as predictable as the head coach making the 2015 Colts sound like thoroughbreds. Page 2 of 2 - That would be a 2015 Colts team that is above .500 (3-2) only because it plays in the land of the AFC South (geography obviously isn’t a strong point of the NFL) and has the luxury of taking advantage of facing weaklings such as Tennessee, Jacksonville and Houston in succession. Parody or parity, what’s the difference? Just ask the coach. “(They’re) good,” Belichick said of the Colts. “Obviously, they’ve won the last three games, two without (starting quarterback Andrew) Luck. Good run defense. Good specialists. Explosive offense. So we’ve got a lot to get ready for.” Hey, we’ll play along. Sunday night’s game, which was circled on the calendar of every red-blooded New England football fan as far back as April when the NFL’s schedule was released, carries no added meaning to the guys who suit up in Foxboro. “The way we work around here, no,” place-kicker Stephen Gostkowski answered when asked if players had metaphorically circled this one on their calendars. “It’s a game. We’re going to try to win it just like we tried to win last game.” So there you have it. The Patriots view Sunday night’s matchup with the Colts as just another game.
