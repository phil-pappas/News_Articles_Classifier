He did not play against Philadelphia on Sunday, and it appears he could be out again when the Jets travel to London to play AFC East rival Miami on Sunday. \nCornerback Darrelle Revis and running back Chris Ivory were limited Wednesday. Revis has a hamstring issue, but said he should be fine. Ivory is dealing with a strained quadriceps that kept him out against the Eagles although he was active. \nRight guard Willie Colon (sprained MCL) and wide receiver Chris Owusu (knee) are already out, and tight end Jeff Cumberland (concussion) and linebacker Trevor Reilly (finger infection) are unlikely to play. \nCoach Todd Bowles said the early decision on Cumberland, who was hurt against the Eagles, was based on the fact the Jets are leaving Thursday night for a long flight to London so it wouldn't make sense to have him travel while recovering from the concussion. \nThat leaves Kellen Davis as the team's only healthy tight end, although wide receiver Quincy Enunwa is also playing a tight end-like role in coordinator Chan Gailey's offense. Bowles said the Jets could look to sign another tight end or promote Wes Saxton from the practice squad. \nSafety Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee) and cornerback Darrin Walls (hamstring) also didn't practice. Cornerback Antonio Cromartie (hip) and linebacker Quinton Coples (sprained elbow) were limited. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:13:38.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
