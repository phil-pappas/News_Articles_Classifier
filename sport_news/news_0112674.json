But all 18 players on an Australian rules football team have to be able to punt on the run, from a variety of angles and distances.\n“All growing up I was kicking the ball in the park,” said Tom Hackett, a native of Australia. “If you can’t kick, you’re not going to make it very far.”\nHackett, like many of his young countrymen, had the dream of being an Australian rules football player. But “I didn’t grow as much as I would have liked – I’m 5-11 3/4 – and the drinking age was 18 in Australia. That might not have helped me lose weight and run fast,” he said with a laugh. So Aussie rules, which requires almost continuous running for four 20-minute quarters, was out.\nBut Hackett could still punt.\nSo he turned to American football. He joined Prokick, an academy in Melbourne that seeks to turn Australians into American football punters . Now a 23-year-old senior at Utah, Hackett won last year’s Ray Guy Award as college’s punter of the year.\nHe is part of a growing number of college players who got their start in Aussie rules before becoming punters in the United States.\nMichigan’s Blake O’Neill, an Australian punter, got unwanted attention last week when he muffed a snap leading to a last-second loss to Michigan State. (He blamed the error in part on his instincts from Australian rules: “I tried to sort of kick it over my head, and that didn’t work out,” he said this week .) But in the same game, O’Neill boomed an 80-yard punt that landed inside the 1-yard line.\nNick Porebski started playing Australian rules football at 9 in Melbourne, but was set back by injuries and spent six months learning American punting at Prokick as a 20-year-old. Now, at 23, he is the starter at Oregon State. Just a few years ago, “trying to pull the jersey over the pads was difficult,” he said.\nOther starting N.C.A.A. punters with Aussie rules backgrounds include Cameron Johnston of No. 1 Ohio State, Jamie Keehn of Louisiana State and Michael Dickson of Texas, who also had an unwelcome moment in the spotlight this season when he bobbled a late snap leading to a loss to Oklahoma State last month.\nBut there has been more success than failure among the Aussie rules graduates in recent years. The year before Hackett won the Ray Guy Award, it was won by another Aussie, Tom Hornsey of Memphis.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Michigan State 27, Michigan 23: Botched Punt in Final Seconds Leaves Wolverines Stunned OCT. 17, 2015 On College Football: That Ending Aside, Michigan Has Reason to Take Heart OCT. 17, 2015 In the pros, the Steelers’ Aussie, Jordan Berry, has the season’s longest punt, at 79 yards, while the Giants’ Brad Wing is in the top 10 in punting yards. They are following in the footsteps of the N.F.L. punters Darren Bennett, who paved the way for his countrymen by playing from 1994 to 2005 for the Chargers and the Vikings, Mat McBriar, Ben Graham and Sav Rocca.\nPhoto Nick Porebski, who started playing Australian rules football at 9 in Melbourne, spent six months learning American punting at Prokick. Credit Scott Barbour/Getty Images American football is growing in popularity in Australia, both because of the increasing number of Aussie punters playing in the United States and the arrival in the N.F.L. of Jarryd Hayne, a 49ers running back with a rugby league background. “It’s really taking off,” Porebski said.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story But the country’s most popular league sport is Aussie ules, whose 30,000-plus average attendance rivals the world’s biggest soccer leagues.\nIt is a free-flowing, physical game in which players try to move the ball down a field significantly larger than a football gridiron. The ball can be advanced by running with an occasional dribble, passing with an open-hand tap or, most importantly, punting it. Goals can be scored only by the foot.\nPhoto Nick Porebski, right, is now the starter at Oregon State. Just a few years ago, he said, “trying to pull the jersey over the pads was difficult.\" Credit Don Ryan/Associated Press For Hackett, the hardest transition to the American game was hitting the big punt that he describes as “the traditional American spiral-torpedo thing.” Aussie rules players tend to kick their ball, which is 30 percent bigger in circumference than an American football, end over end.\n“The rest is Australian Rules Football 101,” he said.\nAnother adjustment was the equipment. Aussie rules players wear shorts, sleeveless T-shirts and not much else. In American football, even the punter’s limited padding is a sharp contrast. A helmet “is still a little uncomfortable to this day,” Hackett said. Porebski said he was concerned that the facemask on his American football helmet could affect his peripheral vision.\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nPorebski also said he found that punting off just two steps in American football was tricky to learn. “In Aussie rules, you’re always kicking on the run,” he said. Aussie rules players also kick across their bodies rather than straight ahead, because they can be tackled from any direction.\nHackett and Porebski say Australian punters have a signature style that make them easy for a connoisseur to spot.\n“The way we roll out and the way we drop the ball,” Porebski said. With an American, “it doesn’t look as natural.”\nIt all starts in the parks in Melbourne, where natural punters are born.", "external_links": ["http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bfbbd39dd74f42dc9676f2228b1f0b85/australian-academy-prepares-punters-us-college-football", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/13934944/blake-oneill-michigan-wolverines-cites-instincts-aussie-rules-football", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/sports/22AUSSIEweb2/22AUSSIEweb2-blog427.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/sports/22AUSSIEweb3/22AUSSIEweb3-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/sports/18TRACYweb1/18TRACYweb1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/sports/22AUSSIEweb3/22AUSSIEweb3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/sports/18MICHIGAN/18MICHIGAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/sports/22AUSSIEweb2/22AUSSIEweb2-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:12:04.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
