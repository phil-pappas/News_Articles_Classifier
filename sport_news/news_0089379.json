(AP Photo/Clint Hughes) Sponsored Links The Associated Press NYON, Switzerland â€” \nUEFA has opened a disciplinary case against Manchester City for fans booing the Champions League anthem. \nThe governing announced the charge Thursday for the \"disruption of competition anthems\" a day after City's game against Sevilla. \nThe case will be heard by UEFA's disciplinary body on Nov. 19. \nCity's ownership and fans are aggrieved with UEFA over past sanctions for breaching Financial Fair Play rules. \nThe anthem jeering also comes at a time when UEFA's standing has been battered by allegations of wrongdoing involving senior officials. \nMichel Platini can't carry out his presidential role after being provisionally suspended by FIFA, pending the outcome of a full investigation into a payment. Senior vice president Angel Maria Villar is also waiting to discover if he'll be found guilty of obstructing an investigation.
