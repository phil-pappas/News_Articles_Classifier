Our offensive line and him were huge tonight.\"\nAverett, who entered the game with 172 yards, broke a 58-yard run after Rymer's interception. He scored on a pair of 6-yard runs in the first half, and added scores of 3- and 2- yards in the third quarter.\nBYU-bound Skyler Southam kicked a 53-yard field goal for Wasatch (5-2, 2-1) in the third quarter and Davis scored on a 5-yard scramble in the fourth quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:55:58.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
