According to cornerback Byron Maxwell, he will be in the lineup against the future Hall of Fame quarterback. \n\"I feel good,\" Maxwell said following Thursday's practice at the NovaCare Complex. \"I'll be out there.\" \nMaxwell departed Sunday's loss to the Washington Redskins at FedEx Field on the first series of the game with a quad contusion and did not return. \nEAGLES VS. SAINTS: Darren Sproles opens up about facing former team for first time \nSurprisingly, opposing quarterbacks have targeted Maxwell. In the three games that he did play this season, Maxwell has surrendered 21 catches for 135 yards and two touchdowns. Albeit Maxwell took his lumps in the season opener against Julio Jones, which has not helped his early season statistics. \nThe Eagles signed Maxwell to a $63 million free agent contract this spring, but the secondary did not appear to play any better or worse without the former Seattle Seahawk in the lineup Sunday afternoon. \nEagles head coach Chip Kelly called Drew Brees 'one of the all-time greats to ever play this game' on Thursday and having Maxwell in the lineup certainly can only help a defense that allowed Kirk Cousins to orchestrate a 90-yard game-winning touchdown drive in Week 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:08:57.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
