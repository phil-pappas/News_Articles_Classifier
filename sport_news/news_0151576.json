CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIn the sea of red jerseys, there were a few spots of bright blue on Wednesday night. Those were the few Montreal supporters at Red Bull Arena, some wearing the team's shirt and others in Chelsea FC from England -- the former home of Impact striker Didier Drogba. \nBut not all the blue No. 11 shirts bore Drogba's name. Some read \"Duka,\" for Montville-raised midfielder Dilly Duka, who had the number until Drogba arrived in late July. \nAnd not all those in Duka shirts were his family. His mother, Figirette Duka, had welcomed her son back home to Montville last night after a team dinner. But he didn't stay long, after a morning practice and afternoon flight. \nThe Impact were scheduled for an early trip back north after a disappointing 2-1 loss to Red Bull New York. \nJake Weis, an 8-year-old midfielder from Wyckoff, said, \"I like him, and I don't really like the Red Bulls.\" Weis plays for the Wyckoff Torpedoes, which are coached by Argjent Duka, Dilly's older brother. \n\"He's a really good player. He's got skills. ... It's fun, because you can see him play and you know him. It's cool.\" \nDuka started on the left wing for Montreal, tucked behind Drogba. Connor Lade of Morristown was the Red Bulls defender on the left, so they didn't cross paths often. \nLade did have the first shot of the game less than two minutes in. But neither figured into any of the goals. \nMontreal went down a man in the 15th minute after Ambroise Oyongo's intentional handball to try to stop a goal. Sascha Kljestan, a Seton Hall alumnus, converted a penalty kick -- though his second PK attempt, less than 20 minutes later, was saved by Impact goalkeeper Evan Bush. \n\"It's always a grind to make the MLS playoffs. You have to have a good year, a full year from start to finish.\" Duka said. \"It was just an off day for us. It's like the perfect storm, right? A penalty kick and a man down in the first 16 minutes of the game.\" \nLloyd Sam gave the Red Bulls a 2-0 lead on a long chip in the 39th minute. Drogba converted a penalty kick of his own in the 68th minute. \n\"I saw a lot of effort,\" said striker Valon Camaj, who invited Duka to attend a Montville High School practice. \"He could be a key player, linking up with Didier (Drogba). He's definitely had a big impact on the team. I hope he stays for a while.\" \nThe Red Bulls took one step closer to the Supporters' Shield on Wednesday night, while the Impact are clinging to the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. \n\"We're excited to see him,\" Figirette Duka said. \"It's exciting all the time. Every time he plays, it's like the first.\" Jane Havsy Multimedia Sports Journalist: A New York City native and Daily Record sports reporter since 2000, Jane is particularly interested in Olympic sports and the interaction of sports with science and technology.<br /><br />Contact Jane by phone at 973-428-6682, or via e-mail: jhavsy@gannettnj.com<br /><br /> MORE FROM GameOn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:32:24.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
