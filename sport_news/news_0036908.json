Cue Cubs fans’ horror. \n“Now, it looks like the days of the curse are behind my Cubs,” Colbert said. “Sure, technically they need to win 11 more games … but I think I can safely say, without any fear of jinxing it, they’re going all the way.” \nThe ever-superstitious Chicago fans have lived in a perennial fear of such brash statements for decades -- but especially since a fan by the name of Steve Bartman famously interfered with a foul ball, plaguing his Cubbies to another dozen years of playoff distress. \nPoor Chicago fans -- they've waited 107 years and counting. Let's hope for their sake that they win another Fall Classic before the Times Square New Year's Eve ball drops in 2122.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:10:41.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
