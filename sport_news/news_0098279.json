He is listed as having bail denied by King County, which in this case likely means he has not yet seen a judge at a bail hearing.\nAccording to The Seattle Times, Coleman was driving a Dodge pickup when his vehicle struck a Honda Civic around 6 p.m. Wednesday. After the crash, Coleman walked away from the scene before being arrested.\nBellevue police tweeted out a photo of the crash on Wednesday.\nSE 36th St Blocked for a heavy rescue in the 13600 block @BvueFD @BvueTrans @kcmetrobus pic.twitter.com/O85LTWh1FN \nâ€” Bellevue, WA Police (@BvuePD) October 15, 2015 One patient was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure after the incident, according to the Bellevue Fire Department.\nColeman's agent Mark Bloom issued the following statement to KOMO News:\nOn the evening of October 15, 2015, Seattle Seahawk Fullback Derrick Coleman, Jr. was involved in a two-car collision soon after leaving a team meeting. While the facts of the case are still being determined, it seems Derrick may have fallen asleep while driving home from a Seahawks' facility.\nThe health and well-being of all involved is our primary concern, and we are thankful to report that both parties are expected to make a full recovery. We will continue to work closely with the local officials while a full investigation is being conducted.\nBellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett will address Coleman's arrest at a 2 p.m. news conference.\nColeman signed with the Minnesota Vikings after going undrafted out of UCLA in 2012. After being released by Minnesota, Coleman joined the Seahawks in December of that year.\nHe developed into a special teams stalwart early in his Seahawks tenure before taking over the team's starting fullback role from Michael Robinson in 2014.\nColeman appeared in just five games in that season, landing on season-ending injured reserve after breaking a bone in his foot during pregame warmups in Seattle's Week 7 matchup with the St. Louis Rams.\nThe 6-foot, 233-pounder has played in all five of the Seahawks' games in 2015, with one carry and one reception on the season. For his career, Coleman has two touchdowns on three rushing attempts and 11 receptions.\nColeman gained notoriety as the first legally deaf player to play on offense in the NFL, serving as an inspirational figure in the deaf community. In June, he released a book, \"No Excuses: Growing Up Deaf and Achieving My Super Bowl Dreams,\" which detailed his rise to the NFL.\nKIRO/7 captured raw footage of the aftermath of the crash.\nVideo: Raw KIRO view: Scene of Bellevue crash", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:29:49.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
