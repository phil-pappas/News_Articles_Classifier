The two sides agreed to a new five-year deal keeping the 24-year-old power forward in Cleveland through the 2020 season. \nThompson took his first gamble before the start of the 2014-15 season, bypassing a reported four-year contract extension worth around $52 million. \nSome scoffed at the decision. After all, in his first three NBA seasons, the 2011 fourth-overall pick had shown little offensive development and didn't look to be anything more than a role player. He hardly had the resume that warranted a hefty contract. \nBut Thompson had a breakout campaign this past year, emerging as one of the best offensive rebounders in the NBA and finishing fifth in the Sixth Man of the Year voting. A picture of health, Thompson didn't miss a game for the third straight season and became a reliable defender, especially in pick-and-roll situations thanks to his quickness and athleticism. More importantly, Thompson showed his value to the organization and to LeBron James, who often spoke about Thompson's importance during the year. James even went as far to say Thompson should be a Cavalier for life. \nMany of Thompson's best moments came during the playoffs when Kevin Love was lost for the season with a dislocated shoulder and Thompson's role increased. He averaged 9.6 points and 10.8 rebounds in the postseason. \nNo matter how anyone feels about the new contract worth a reported $82 million, and his deal led to mixed opinions, these performances show Thompson's value. They all helped him earn his new contract, one that makes him the sixth-highest paid power forward in the NBA. \nOct. 31, 2014 – Chicago Bulls \nStats: 36 minutes, 16 points, 7-of-13 field goals, 2-of-2 free throws, 13 rebounds, two assists, two blocks \nSummary: This game was circled as soon as the schedule was released. In Chicago. Against the Bulls, a team expected to be one of the biggest obstacles along Cleveland's lengthy journey to the top of the Eastern Conference. It was Thompson, who helped the Cavs rebound from an opening night loss against the New York Knicks. \nHis first of 14 double doubles on the season, Thompson scored 16 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, including 12 on the offensive side. \nFive of Thompson's offensive boards came in the overtime period, showing that he would likely be part of Cleveland's closing lineup. Thompson's work on the glass led to the Cavs having a 10-rebound edge. \nPrized off-season acquisition Pau Gasol was expected to be the Bulls' difference maker, another piece in the frontcourt, giving Chicago a strength advantage inside. But as much as Gasol tried to fight with Thompson and keep him off the boards, he couldn't. Joakim Noah also tried and failed. Even Taj Gibson was no match. \nThompson's relentless effort sent an early-season message to one of the Cavs' biggest adversaries. \nNov. 29, 2014 – Indiana Pacers \nStats: 39 minutes, 13 points, 4-of-8 field goals, 5-of-10 free throws, 11 rebounds, one assist, one block \nSummary: Thompson, an undersized power forward, got the start at center for the Cavs against the tough, rugged and defensive-minded Pacers. \nThe Eastern Conference bully was without Roy Hibbert, but David West and Ian Mahinmi were in the lineup hoping to exploit Thompson's lack of size. \nThe Pacers, like the Bulls, were expected to have the advantage inside against the more finesse and hyped Cavs, but Thompson held his ground. \nHis stat line showed another double double. But it was another stat, plus minus, that summed up his night. Thompson finished +25, better than both LeBron James and Love. \nDec. 5, 2015 – Toronto Raptors \nStats: 33 minutes, 21 points, 8-of-13 field goals, 5-of-8 free throws, 14 rebounds, two assists \nSummary: Anytime Canadian-born Thompson goes to Toronto it's a memorable game, at least for him. \nAgainst another likely playoff team, Thompson delivered his biggest night offensively, showing growth on that end of the floor. He had 21 points, the fifth highest of his career, on 8-of-13 shooting. That kind of game showed the hard work and extra practice sessions on the offensive end of the floor were starting to pay dividends. \nDec. 30, 2015 – Atlanta Hawks \nStats: 42 minutes, 18 points, 9-of-12 field goals, 0-of-5 free throws, 13 rebounds \nSummary: One week earlier, the Cavs lost Anderson Varejao for the season. His hustle and and non-stop effort had been absent as the team was searching for answers inside. At first, Blatt tried a small-ball lineup. It wasn't very successful. So he moved Thompson back into the starting lineup. \nIt started coming together against the Hawks, a team that had gotten off to a surprising start, soaring to the top of the East. \nIn a losing effort, in the midst of a tough stretch for the Cavs, Thompson matched up well against Atlanta's frontcourt All-Stars, Paul Millsap and Al Horford. \nThompson played a season-high in minutes before fouling out late. He also provided an offensive boost, one of three players in double figures on a night when James was resting. \nJan. 16, 2015 – Los Angeles Clippers \nStats: 40 minutes, 24 points, 10-of-12 field goals, 4-of-4 free throws, 12 rebounds, two blocks, \nSummary: Timofey Mozgov had arrived one week earlier in a trade with Denver. The big Russian looked poised to move Thompson back to the bench. But Kevin Love's back injury against the Lakers on the first of a back-to-back opened the door for Thompson to get a spot start. He capitalized. \nAgainst DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin, Thompson scored a season-high 24 points, including an important basket late in the fourth quarter. \nWith less than one minute left, it was a four-point game. Blatt called timeout to set up a play and used James to send in the inbounds pass. \nBlatt and James knew the defense would key on Kyrie Irving so he was used as the decoy. Griffin hesitated and left Thompson open cutting to the basket. James rifled the pass to Thompson, who made the layup and the subsequent free throw, giving the Cavs a seven-point lead. \nIt was only a January game in L.A., but it was one of the most important wins of the season. With drama surrounding the team and rumors swirling about Blatt's coaching future, Thompson's basket put the exclamation point on back-to-back wins for the first time since before Christmas. It allowed the Cavs to finish the season-altering west coast road trip on a positive note. That's where the second half surge began. \nMarch 1, 2015 – Houston Rockets \nStats: 37 minutes, 14 points, 5-of-9 field goals, 4-of-4 free throws, 19 rebounds, one assist, one block, two steals \nSummary: Thompson struggled in the month of February. Coming off the bench, he had seen his minutes, points and rebounds decrease. It looked like his role was slowly diminishing as well. \nMarch was an opportunity to get things going in the other direction. And he got off to a great start. \nOn the road against Houston, one of the best teams in the Western Conference, Thompson showed persistent effort on the boards, grabbing 11 of his game-high 19 on the offensive end. His 11 were three more than Houston had as a team that day. Even in a losing effort, Thompson showed his worth as one of Cleveland's most important second unit players. Cleveland Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson (13) matched up well against Chicago's Pau Gasol (16) in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Nam Y. Huh, Associated Press \nMay 6, 2015 – Chicago Bulls – Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals \nStats: 35 minutes, five points, 2-of-5 field goals, 1-of-2 free throws, 12 rebounds, one assist \nSummary: The Cavs were still reeling after hearing the news about Love's season-ending shoulder injury. They had just lost the first game of the Eastern Conference semis at home in a game where Thompson made little impact. \nThe Bulls ran pick-and-pop plays throughout Game 1, as Gasol poured in 21 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. Thompson, meanwhile, came off the bench, scoring just four points and grabbing eight rebounds in 37 minutes. \nBut following the Game 1 loss, Blatt made a permanent starting lineup change, going back to Thompson. \nHis box score wasn't all that impressive but the lineup change, with Thompson starting, helped the Cavs pick up their first win of the series. \nThe Cavs won the rebounding advantage, and Thompson helped limit Gasol, holding him to 11 points and four rebounds. It was their first win of the series. \nMay 24, 2015 – Atlanta Hawks – Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals \nStats: 43 minutes, 10 points, 5-of-7 field goals, 0-of-3 free throws, seven rebounds, two assists, two blocks \nSummary: Thompson had spent the first two games of the Eastern Conference Finals silencing the crowd inside Philips Arena and frustrating the Hawks with his timely offensive rebounds. He pounded Atlanta's bigs on the glass and made Millsap look pedestrian. \nWith each rebound, he fueled the shorthanded Cavs and shattered Atlanta's confidence. The Hawks tried two guys. Sometimes they tried three. They tried face-guarding him. Nothing worked. \nThat continued into Game 3. Thompson finished the night with seven rebounds, his lowest of the series, but as he had done throughout his breakout season, Thompson grabbed the one that mattered most. \nDown by two points with under a minute left, Jeff Teague had hit a cold-blooded three-pointer one possession earlier. \nThe Cavs, with the sellout crowd behind them, needed an answer. \nBypassing a timeout, the ball was in James' hands. Eyeing the defense, James attacked, put up a tough shot and missed. With an Atlanta rebound, the Cavs could've been staring at another playoff home loss and the series extending beyond four games. Thompson didn't let it happen. Thompson grabbed the offensive rebound, tossed it out to an exhausted James, and the four-time MVP hit the go-ahead triple. \nThe win got the Cavs one win from a trip to the NBA Finals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:04:40.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
