The Georgia trip was unsuccessful in terms of preseason records, but the Silver and Black was able to squeeze in bonding time. As well as having a brush with Hollywood, they caught up with former teammate, Tiago Splitter, for a pregame meal before facing off on the court.\nAnd they said the Spurs were boring.\nThey will take on the Detroit Pistons on Sunday for their first home game, at the renovated AT&T Center's grand opening.\nmmendoza@mysa.com\nTwitter: @MaddySkye", "external_links":
