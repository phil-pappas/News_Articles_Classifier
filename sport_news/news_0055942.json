Jackson on crash course ... Bowe can’t catch on ... A fine mess for Vernon By Bill Lankhof , Toronto Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 06:15 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 06:31 PM EDT Head Coach Rex Ryan of the Buffalo Bills walks the sideline during the second half of a game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Ralph Wilson Stadium on October 18, 2015 in Orchard Park, New York. Brett Carlsen/Getty Images/AFP Article \nRex Ryan has been doing a little soul searching, not to mention reading a few of the headlines criticizing his play-calling. \nHe admits the critics might have a point. \nLinemen Mario Williams, Jerry Hughes and Marcell Dareus each suggested Ryan hasn’t allowed the NFL’s highest-paid defensive line off its leash often enough. \nWednesday, Ryan agreed that perhaps he has been too passive with his high-octane defence, which has just nine sacks in six games. \n“I would say that I probably agree with them,” Ryan said. “When you look at it, should we rush more this past week in particular? That’s probably true. I’m not perfect as a playcaller and all that. But I try to do the best.” \nInstead of blitzing and attempting to pass rush, Ryan has dropped players - particularly Williams - into coverage. It didn’t work against Andy Dalton last week, and it has left pass rushers used to pinning their ears back and busting straight ahead, frustrated. “We haven’t had the results that we’ve wanted,” Ryan admitted. “There’s no question about that.” \nEven Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly told Yahoo Sports this week he didn’t understand why Ryan was dropping Williams into coverage so often. \n“I don’t necessarily disagree with Marcell and Mario’s views,” Ryan admitted, which suggests he could be letting the dogs loose this weekend in London against the Jaguars. \nMeanwhile, he remains optimistic of a happy solution. “We don’t have to lead the league in sacks. We just want to win. If we end up doing that,” Ryan said, “we’ll all be happy at the end of the day.” \nIf the Bills can return from London with more than selfies at the gates of Buckingham Palace and a souvenir spoon of London Bridge - say a W in the standings - it would be a good step in that direction. \nA RIDDLE, TIMES TWO \nTwo of the NFL’s marquee quarterbacks are being looked at with jaundiced eyes. \nNot so long ago, to suggest Colin Kaepernick or Peyton Manning deserved to be benched would’ve been laughable. \nBut six weeks into the season, few would argue that both need to step up. Manning gets a bye week to figure out why opposing secondaries are some of his favourite targets. With 10 interceptions, and ranked 45th among NFL quarterbacks in passer rating, he’ll need every second to prepare for the undefeated Packers, Nov. 1. \n“(Manning) knows we have to get rid of these turnovers,” coach Gary Kubiak said. “He knows that. I think he’s trying to do too much at times, but he’s also doing everything for us at times to help us win football games. We got a find a medium there.” \nManning hasn’t been this ineffective since his rookie year, when 26 touchdowns and 28 interceptions resulted in a passer rating of 71.2. With a 6-0 record, there’s no way Denver benches a league icon. But with a passer rating that leaves him trailing the likes of Kirk Cousins and Sam Bradford, there’s also little to suggest that, unless he finds his Inner Manning, the Broncos will go anywhere come playoff time. \nFor Kaepernick the criticism has calmed after two decent performances but Thursday he gets a critical test against a desperate Seahawks team. \nIt should be a fair barometer to tell how far Kaepernick will take the 49ers. Seattle has given him trouble in the past - just one win in six starts with three TD passes and nine interceptions. \n“There are holes in every defence. Opportunities against every defence,” Kaepernick told reporters. “We have to be able to find those and exploit those. They’re a good defence. I’m not going to take credit away from what they’ve been able to do. I do have to go out and perform better.” \nSORRY WON’T CUT IT \nDolphins defensive end Olivier Vernon said he was sorry. \nThat might’ve been good enough for Marcus Mariota. But not for the NFL. \nOn a play that Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt observed was “bulls— football”, Vernon was flagged for hitting Mariota in the knee. Mariota said that Vernon later apologized. \nWednesday Vernon said he’d been fined anyway and that he plans to appeal, telling the Miami Herald: “Nobody tries to play the game to hurt somebody. That’s definitely not my game.” \nNobody? Hmmm! Guess Ndamukong Suh really is having an off year. \nRICE ‘N’ DICE? \nTMZ suggested when he demolished a stop sign Tuesday, crashing his Corvette, that Seattle running back Fred Jackson was racing Marshawn Lynch. \nNot so, says head coach Pete Carroll. “Fred lost control of his car, had an accident, and he was ticketed for that,” Carroll said, noting no other players were involved. \nPolice agreed there was no evidence of speeding, and that Jackson was fined for “inattention”. \nTMZ, of course, specializes in tales of running backs punching out the lights of anything in their path. Film at 11? \nDITCHING DWAYNE \nThe Browns are paying Dwayne Bowe $9 million. Nobody knows why. \nThe former Chiefs star has been a healthy scratch in four of six games with Travis Benjamin, Brian Hartline, Andrew Hawkins and Taylor Gabriel at receiver. \nIt looks like that won’t change soon with coach Mike Pettine saying: “The top 4 guys (at wide receiver) are entrenched.” \nQUICK HITS \nWith Prince Amukamara out with a pectoral injury, the Giants signed cornerback Leon McFadden off the Cards practice roster ... Cameron Wake is AFC defensive player of the week, recording four sacks and two forced fumbles. Chiefs’ Jeremy Maclin, Alex Smith’s favorite target with 39 catches, is out with a concussion ... Dez Bryant worked on the sideline during practice shedding doubt on owner Jerry Jones’ observation Bryant would play this weekend ... Ravens tight end Dennis Pitta, who many feared wouldn’t play again after fracturing his hip for the second time, returned to practice Wednesday. “He’s going to see how he feels out here,” coach John Harbaugh said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:43:49.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
