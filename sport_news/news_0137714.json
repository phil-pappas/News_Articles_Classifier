Despite the mess on the tracks, no one was killed.\nLoaded with 98 passengers and four crew, Amtrak's Vermonter train made an unscheduled stop Monday, derailing in Northfield.\nThe crash sent seven people to the hospital, one by helicopter.\n\"My heart goes out to the passengers and the crew who went through this traumatic experience, and we're very lucky there was no loss of life,\" said Gov. Peter Shumlin, at an afternoon news conference at Norwich University.\nInvestigators say the train smashed into six pieces of ledge which fell onto the tracks sometime after a freight train traveled the same stretch late Sunday night. The engine and a passenger car landed in a creek bed, three more cars stayed upright after leaving the tracks.\nThe train, known as the Vermonter, travels at nearly 60 miles per hour through the area typically; it's unclear if the engineer hit the brakes before the hitting the fallen ledge around 10:30 a.m. \"Next thing we knew, we kind of swerved to the left, and then swerved to the right and we were all going, 'uh oh,'\" said Rita Kimble, a passenger from California.\nThe remote location forced responders to pull out the injured on ATV. Staff at Northfield Country Club provided direction. \"We just put them all on golf-carts and led them up to the tracks to the opening for the best place to get in\" said the club's Ryan McDonald.\nThe club also served as a landing pad for a medical airlift. Those who could walk away from the wreckage, took busses to a temporary shelter at Norwich University before finishing their trip on charter busses.\nThe Governor says the accident should not dissuade the public from getting on a train once the line re-opens. \"When we have a transportation crash we don't say let's stop driving cars, we say how do we make them safer,\" he said.\nAnd the Governor says that's just what Vermont will do after the Vermonter's unprecedented crash.\nRepairs on the line could take days, so Amtrak is modifying its Vermonter route. Train service will run from Springfield Massachusetts to Washington DC -- and back -- with alternate transportation provided to and from Vermont.\nThe derailment led Public Safety officials to activate the State Emergency Operations Center in Waterbury to coordinate the response. That Included the state Hazmat team which responded to a diesel spill in the brook called Bull Run. State and local search and rescue teams swept the train to make sure all passengers were accounted for. Homeland Security was also called to assist in the investigation and response, and State Police handled traffic control in the area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:49:54.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
