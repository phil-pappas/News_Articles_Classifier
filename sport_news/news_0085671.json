Because, when presented to horse-racing society at Keeneland’s 2013 September yearling sale, she was like the prom queen candidate who doesn’t get a single vote.\nAs breeders Carolyn and Fletcher Gray recall, not one prospective buyer nodded, raised a finger, scratched an ear or any of the other subtle signs of someone bidding. As it was, the Grays’ reserve — or minimum sales price — was only $30,000. So they paid the sales commission on that price and raced the chestnut filly themselves.\n“Nobody else wanted her,” Fletcher Gray said Sunday at Keeneland after I’m A Chatterbox worked a half-mile under jockey Florent Geroux in 47 1/5 seconds, fastest of the morning. “How we make our living is selling. But we know more about them than anybody else, and we don’t bring stuff over here to sell that we’re not willing to race.”\n“Her dam is the same way: she’s narrow and tall,” Carolyn Gray said. “As you can see by Chatterbox now, she’s very athletic and lithe. She’s not a big, strong colt-type filly. So we weren’t terribly surprised because everybody likes big stout horses at the sale.”\nIf I’m A Chatterbox knows she was dissed, she’s channeling it into proving people wrong and working hard to be crowned 3-year-old filly champ. The gangly one-time wallflower clearly filled out in the right places.\n“She’s got the prom dress on now,” Carolyn said with a laugh.\nThe wonderfully versatile I’m A Chatterbox officially has won five of her 10 starts, with a pair of seconds and thirds, running out $1.3 million. With Larry Jones assuming her training this year, she became a Grade I winner by dominating Parx Racing’s Cotillion for 3-year-old fillies in her last start, Sept. 19. Now it’s on to the $2 million Breeders’ Cup Distaff at Keeneland, the track where I’m A Chatterbox won her debut a year ago.\nTrainer Larry Jones led the 3-year-old filly I'm A Chatterbox and jockey Florent Geroux into Keeneland's paddock before her workout Sunday morning.

Naw, she ran beautifully that day. We’re always proud of her.”\nI’m A Chatterbox subsequently was second to Embellish the Lace in Saratoga’s Alabama before easily handling that rival in the Cotillion. Knocking out a Grade I with I’m A Chatterbox was huge for the Grays.\n“I think it was a difference of $160,000 between first and second” in the CCA Oaks, Jones said. “That’s a big lick. But that’s nothing compared to what they would lose if she doesn’t ever win a Grade I and get to keep it. Because they own the mare, they own her, have so many siblings. That runs into millions fast. At least they get to keep it now. So now it only cost them $160,000.”\nThe Grays have seven broodmares on their farm near Springfield in southwest Missouri, sending them to Kentucky to foal and then bringing moms and kids home. I’m A Chatterbox has to be one of the most accomplished horses raised in Missouri since 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood, the only Derby winner actually born in the Show Me State.\nFor I’m A Chatterbox, it should be the Show Them State.\nHad the Grays gotten their $30,000 reserve, that really only reflects what they had invested in her with the stud fee, raising the horse and sales prep. They didn’t imagine I’m A Chatterbox as a home-run horse. Maybe a bunter — just get on base.\n“We’ll just take it a single at a time,” Fletcher Gray said.\nAnd single is usually what the Grays have in their racing stable.\nThey sell almost all their babies, and usually only have one horse racing at a time. “But that’s gotten out of hand,” Fletcher Gray said.\nIndeed, their racing stable has ballooned to four: I’m A Chatterbox and three 2-year-olds. Jones, who has trained two other stakes-winning horses that the Grays couldn’t sell, is looking forward to it.\n“They do such a fantastic job,” Jones said.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9cfb571a4fb10f5fd5ebff692b4dd7f0e1c82d40/c=75-0-2325-3000&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/11/Louisville/Louisville/635801740762390460-I-m-a-chatterbox-paddock-head-on.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c8d0da1902572f66ef9a261b438c490f3cbd7735/r=320x400/local/-/media/2015/10/11/Louisville/Louisville/635801740762390460-I-m-a-chatterbox-paddock-head-on.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/11/Louisville/Louisville/635801740762390460-I-m-a-chatterbox-paddock-head-on.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:06:01.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
