He had surgery Sept. 2. \nAnother key pass-catcher, Atlanta receiver Julio Jones, is active against the Washington Redskins after being listed as questionable with hamstring and toe injuries. \nOffensive tackle Jake Long, who signed on Sept. 15, is active for the first time for the Falcons. \nAs expected, the Seattle Seahawks, who play at Cincinnati, are without Marshawn Lynch for the second game in a row with an injured hamstring, while the Buffalo Bills won’t have receiver Sammy Watkins, or running backs LeSean McCoy and Karlos Williams, all because of injuries. \nThe Titans chose to keep right guard Chance Warmack out a second straight game, giving him an extra week to heal a sprained MCL in his right knee. \nBryan Bulaga is back for the Packers at right tackle after missing the past three games with a left knee injury. It’s a boost for a Green Bay offensive line that must contend with the active defensive front of the St. Louis Rams. \n___ \nWASHINGTON at ATLANTA \nRedskins: QB Robert Griffin III, WR DeSean Jackson, CB DeAngelo Hall, CB Chris Culliver, DE Frank Kearse, OG Arie Kouandjio, TE Jordan Reed. \nFalcons: LB Justin Durant, WR Justin Hardy, S Charles Godfrey, CB Dez Southward, C Gino Gradkowski, T Bryce Harris, DE Malliciah Goodman. \n___ \nST.
