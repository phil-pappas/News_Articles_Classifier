(AP) - Paxton Lynch threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns as Memphis stunned No. 13 Mississippi 37-24 on Saturday. \nMemphis (6-0) has won 13 straight games dating back to last season, which is the third longest streak in the nation. It was the first win for the Tigers over a ranked opponent since 1996. \nOle Miss (5-2) jumped out to a 14-0 lead less than six minutes into the game - partly thanks to a 68-yard touchdown pass by receiver Laquon Treadwell on a trick play - but Memphis responded with 31 unanswered points to take a 31-14 lead early in the third quarter. \nLynch was superb, completing 39 of 53 passes. Anthony Miller caught 10 passes for 132 yards and a touchdown.
