Teammate Jordan Evans recovered the loose ball and returned it for a touchdown.\n\"That guy, he makes so many plays,\" said OU senior defensive end Charles Tapper of Striker. \"It's exciting to watch him do these things. Like when he got that strip sack, it was, like, textbook. I said 'bro, that was a textbook play. You couldn't have done that any more perfect.'\"\nBut there is no manual or how-to to being Striker, the senior outside linebacker from Seffner, Fla. As he enters his final OU-Texas rivalry game Saturday at the Cotton Bowl, he's made his mark by being passionately, imperfectly impactful on the program and university.\nStriker's teammates describe him as an infusion of energy, and the vocal pulse of the program, even when the topics have been hard and the words raw.\n\"Everybody should have an opinion, regardless of who you are and what you do,\" Striker said this week. \"In some ways, you've got to know not everybody is going to agree with you. You're going to get people that love you for it, people that hate you for it. You've got to stand for what you believe in at the end of the day.\"\nStriker led the OU players' response last March after video emerged of the school's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter engaging in a racist chant.\nHis initial Snapchat rant, filled with expletives, went viral. But Striker later continued an open dialogue about racism on campus and remains involved in outreach.\nAt the time, he reached out to The Oklahoman in an effort to expand on his feelings.\n\"I hate to be defined as a football player,\" he told the newspaper. \"We have to take a stand. Our voices have to be heard.\"\nStriker declined to discuss this week the feelings of last spring, because he said he felt he and the university have moved forward in positive ways. The fraternity was quickly shut down.\nStriker said he hopes that other athletes will feel comfortable speaking out in the future.\n\"That's just him,\" said Tapper, Striker's roommate, noting that the outgoing linebacker is friends with everybody. \"He reacts. He doesn't react in a physical manner, but he speaks his mind. If something's happening bad to anybody, he's going to speak up for them.\"\nOn the field, Striker's intensity is felt by opposing offenses.\nAgainst West Virginia, Striker (6-0, 222) tied career highs with 12 tackles and three tackles for loss (including two sacks) while also forcing the fourth-quarter fumble.\nStriker is already OU's all-time career leader in sacks among linebackers with 18.\n\"Just out there having fun,\" Striker said. \"You want to produce like that every game.\"\nThe up-and-down OU defense, which allowed 603 yards to Tulsa but limited West Virginia to 369, revolves around Striker.\n\"Eric Striker is the biggest ball of energy I've very met in my life,\" said cornerback Jordan Thomas. \"He has this whole lingo where he doesn't get tired and I'm like, 'Yeah, Eric, you're full of it.' But I have yet to see this guy quit on anything. His energy and excitement and fire jumpstart the entire defense.\"\nStriker's enthusiasm continued into the postgame on-field celebration after OU's double-overtime win at Tennessee earlier this season, with Striker reportedly engaging Volunteers fans with inappropriate language. Striker later issued an apology.\nBefore the game he'd wondered to the reporters regarding the SEC, \"I don't know why people blow gas up their [expletive] all time.\"\nInclude the Red River Showdown among Striker's passions. He called it \"a beautiful game.\" Leave it up to him to try to put the rivalry into words, with his biggest statement planned for Saturday's game.\n\"The atmosphere is just the best,\" he said. \"You look forward to it. You wish it could last forever, but it only comes around once a year. I'm going to miss it, man, nothing like it.\n\"Hopefully I can hold that gold hat at the end, and say I was 3-1 [against Texas].\nMore Oklahoma content\nÂ\nOklahoma Sooners\nCoach:Â Bob Stoops, 17th season with Oklahoma (10-6 against Texas)\n2015 Record:Â 4-0, 1-0 in Big 12\nLast:Â Defeated West Virginia, 44-24, on Oct. 3\nOklahoma prediction: Sooners' defense extends Texas Longhorns' season-long free fall\nHairopoulos: How Austin native Mayfield ended up a Sooners QB and darkhorse Heisman candidate\nFive things Sooners fans need to know about the Longhorns, including Sterling Shepard's career against UT\nStoops: 'Just beat Texas' not enough to make Sooners' season anymore\nSooners only have to look at 2013 to know what a struggling Texas team is capable of\nBig plays made difference for Sooners in 2014\nCarlton: Streaking Sooners look to add to Texas' historically bad start to season\nStoops wants Oklahoma to cut down on penalties\nOklahoma quotable: Bob Stoops says Sooners are 'aware' of Jerrod Heard's talent; on monitoring players' social media\nOklahoma quotable: Bob Stoops on Sooners creating turnovers, facing Longhorns\nHairopoulos: Oklahoma running back adjusting to life behind new offensive line\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/06/sooners-look-2013-know-struggling-texas-team-capable", "https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/06/big-plays-made-difference-sooners-2014", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/05/oklahoma-quotable-bob-stoops-says-sooners-aware-jerrod-heards-talent-monitoring-players-social-media", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/05/stoops-wants-oklahoma-cut-penalties", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/oklahoma-prediction-sooners-defense-extends-texas-longhorns-season-long-free-fall", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/carlton-streaking-sooners-look-add-texas-historically-bad-start-season", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/06/five-things-sooners-fans-need-know-longhorns-including-sterling-shepards-career-ut", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/oklahoma-quotable-bob-stoops-sooners-creating-turnovers-facing-texas-longhorns-next-week", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/07/hairopoulos-oklahoma-running-back-adjusting-life-behind-new-offensive-line", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/06/stoops-just-beat-texas-enough-make-sooners-season-anymore", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/06/hairopoulos-austin-native-mayfield-ended-sooners-qb-darkhorse-heisman-candidate"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:13:40.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
