Tuskegee coach Willie Slater said the Maroon Tigers (3-2, 0-1) always give one of their strongest efforts of the season in this contest. \nBut Slater said that is nothing unusual for the Golden Tigers, who have won at least a share of the SIAC 29 times in program history, including last season. \n\"We know every time we play we are going to get the other team's best,\" Slater said. \"I wouldn't have it any other way. If you can win the conference with everyone putting the target on your back, then you know you deserve to win it. That is our goal every year.\" \nTuskegee apparently wears that target outside the SIAC as well. Non-conference opponent UNC Pembroke handed the Golden Tigers their first loss of the season last week, 29-17, ending Tuskegee's best start in seven years. \nMorehouse's two losses this season have been in triple overtime to Arkansas Pine-Bluff, and by a field goal to Miles. \nThe Maroon Tigers have allowed an average of only 15 points per game in regulation (they gave up 22 in overtime). They are second in the conference in total defense, allowing an average of 253.2 yards per game. \nTuskegee counters with an offense that is averaging 327 yards, the second best in the league. Before being held to 17 points by Pembroke on a rain-soaked field, the Golden Tigers had averaged more than 30 points per game. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:44:08.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
