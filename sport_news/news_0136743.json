Gray . That failure allowed him to sexually assault her in 2013, she alleges.\nDaniel G. Gray Oregon Department of Corrections Gray, 50, was convicted last year of breaking into the woman's dwelling in an Albany mobile home complex and attacking her. He is serving a six-year term in the Oregon State Penitentiary.\nThe lawsuit recounts a series of disturbing events that the woman recalls from the weeks before her attack. The Oregonian/OregonLive is not naming her because she is the victim of sexual assault.\nA U.S. Postal Inspection Service spokesman in Seattle did not return a call and an email seeking comment.\nOn June 22, 2013, the woman's husband died and she stayed with her family for a few weeks to grieve, returning to her home on July 14.\n\"She checked her mail and saw a note indicating that the post office had attempted a registered delivery of her husband's ashes from the crematorium,\" the lawsuit says. \"The next day, Gray, in uniform and acting in his role as a mail carrier, asked plaintiff if she had received the note.\"\nThe woman told Gray what the package contained.\n\"Over the following several weeks, Gray was unusually friendly toward (the woman). Though the mailboxes for the mobile home park were all located in one central location, Gray went out of his way to come to plaintiff's door to ask how she was doing after losing her husband,\" according to the lawsuit.\nThe woman found his behavior odd; the letter carrier had never been friendly before, she says in the suit.\nOn Aug. 20, he knocked on her door and she asked if he had a package for her. He said yes and suddenly pushed into her home.\n\"Once through the doorway, he grabbed her and wrapped his arms around her, trying to kiss her and bite her neck,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"He also forcibly grabbed her buttocks. (She) was shocked and terrified.\"\n\"What are you doing?\" she exclaimed. \"I'm a 75-year-old woman!\"\nShe resisted Gray and pushed him toward the door, shoving him outside, according to the lawsuit. She locked the door and called police.\nThat night, Gray was arrested on suspicion of sexual abuse and burglary. But the next morning, the woman learned he had been released on bail. Panic-stricken, she told a detective she was fleeing to stay with friends and family out of state, the lawsuit says.\nBetween 2002 and 2012, several women on Gray's route complained to his supervisors that he had pursued them for dates, made sexually suggestive comments and tried to kiss one of them against her will, according to the suit.\nOne woman who worked in a store on Gray's route complained that he constantly stopped in to see her and sent her unwanted texts while he was on the job. \"Many of these texts were of a sexual nature,\" the lawsuit claims, \"and included pictures of Gray in the nude with an erection.\"\n-- Bryan Denson\nbdenson@oregonian.com\n503-294-7614; @Bryan_Denson", "external_links": ["http://democratherald.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/jury-finds-mailman-guilty-of-groping-burglary/article_e7cf077a-ee98-11e3-ab19-001a4bcf887a.html", "http://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/groping-incident-brings-former-mailman-six-years-in-prison/article_53f04604-01b2-11e4-aace-0019bb2963f4.html", "https://twitter.com/Bryan_Denson", "https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/"], "published": "2015-10-06T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:16:55.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
