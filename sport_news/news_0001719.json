He only really had a small stress crack in it. \n\"To have a guy who probably was the player of the Super Rugby season gives us genuine pace and ability to beat people. It's exciting to have someone like that in your group. \n\"To have him out on the track after the disappointment of thinking we weren't going to be able to select him, to get a second chance is wonderful. \n\"He has worked extremely hard, as have the medical staff with him, to get him to where we have. We are extremely confident he is ready to play.\" \nThe Millennium Stadium meeting with Georgia should see New Zealand tighten their grip on Pool C. \n\"Georgia aren't a team who we know a lot about,\" Hansen added. \"It's hard to get footage from afar, but we have enough of it. \n\"They are big, physical, strong men, and they will try to play a game to dominate the set-piece and slow it down a bit.\" \nNew Zealand team (versus Georgia): B Smith; W Naholo, C Smith, S B Williams, J Savea; D Carter, A Smith; W Crockett, D Coles, C Faumuina, B Retallick, S Whitelock, J Kaino, R McCaw (capt), K Read. \nReplacements: K Mealamu, T Woodcock, O Franks, V Vito, S Cane, T Kerr-Barlow, TJ Perenara, M Fekitoa.
