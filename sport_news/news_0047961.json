Anderson tells The Hattiesburg American ( http://hatne.ws/1R5TPmJ ) that's exciting, because nobody on the team has played on the home field. They've had to play on any available diamond. \nSmokie Harrington Park was heavily damaged by the February 2013 tornado. The restored stadium will reopen in February. \nIt's among several public high school athletic facilities nearing completion in the Pine Belt. A girls' volleyball facility and the Purvis Field House also are almost done. \nThe baseball stadium's black and cream brick wall, built in the 1940s, is considered a historical artifact. Building and grounds director Willie Burton says that meant all the plans needed approval from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. \nInformation from: The Hattiesburg American, http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:12:45.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
