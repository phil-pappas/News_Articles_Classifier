Brandan Gump rushed it in from the 9-yard line to give the Pintos an 8-0 lead. \nLater in the first quarter on the California’s next possession, quarterback Jacob Wolken found Josh Woodruff down the right sideline for the 71-yard touchdown reception and the 14-0 lead. \nWolken used his feet on the Pintos’ next drive, rushing for a gain of 14 yards on a second-and-10 play deep in Warsaw’s territory, then he scored from 24 yards out to extend the lead to 22-0. Wolken broke a would-be tackle at the 10-yard line as he rushed the ball up the middle. \nGump scored his second touchdown of the game late in the first half, rushing around the right side for the 6-yard score. That pushed the lead to 29-0 at the half. \nThat drive started after Gump recovered a fumble on defense near midfield. \nOn its first drive of the second half, California added to the lead with another touchdown. Wolken connected with Landon Mouse for a 15-yard gain on fourth down, then four plays later, Mouse caught a 36-yard pass from Wolken for the Pintos’ fifth and final touchdown of game. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:15:54.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
