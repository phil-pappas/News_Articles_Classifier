(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) \nWASHINGTON — Rose-colored glasses are hard to have with the burgundy and gold. It seems for almost a generation now the Redskins disappoint more than they please. Related Stories NFL Week 6 Recap Sports Maybe my perspective is from low expectations. Two and four is nothing to shout about, but in a cluttered NFC East this season is not over for the Redskins.\nIt is often said there is a fine line between winning and losing, but in football it is just about the line — the line of scrimmage. For all the fancy passing schemes, football games are still won in the trenches and that’s where the Redskins have slipped. \nOver the last two weeks, in losses to the Falcons and Jets, the Redskins have failed to establish the run and failed to stop the run. The Redskins have only collected 85 yards on the ground in the last two games, while giving up 397 yards. In the first four games of the season, the Redskins only allowed opponents 312 yards rushing. \nThis Redskins team can compete, but can it adjust. At halftime Sunday the Redskins had a 13-10 lead, but then the Jets rattled off 24 unanswered points. In third quarters this season the Redskins have been outscored 46-3. Yes, I think it is time to change the halftime routine. \nChange the halftime routine, yes, but not the quarterback. Without question with eight interceptions in six games Kirk Cousins has to be better. Still, he needs more time to truly show what he can do. It just means Redskins’ fans will have to be patient. \nAt least it is something to which the burgundy and gold faithful has become accustomed. \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP.
