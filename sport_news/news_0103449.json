You can't photograph a dream, or a memory, or the qualities that make those things so real to the self and so invisible to others: fantasy, fear, fondness, incompleteness, arousal, mystery.\nWords inevitably fall short. There's nothing more boring than when someone starts to tell you about the dream they had last night.\nYou need art, with its million shades of blue and gray and red, to convey the imprecision of recollection, its endless layers of surface and mingling of lines and materials to fix, as best you can, the movable contours between reality and illusion.\nAshley Eliza Willams' oil painting \"Reverberation\" can be seen at Goodwin Fine Art. ( Image provided by Goodwin Fine Art ) Both Ashley Eliza Williams and Amber Cobb employ art's exclusive narrative powers in the objects they make. They tell stories without language, though in great detail, allowing tales to unfold with all the possible facts clear and any ambiguities fully respected.\nCobb, currently showing at Gildar Gallery , starts close to home, morphing familiar domestic items, such as blankets and bedroom furniture, into enigmas, often by pouring a liquid silicone — the same stuff used to cast prosthetic limbs, such as hands and feet — over them and allowing it to dry.\nThese most intimate things, the ones that touch our skin and rub against our naked bodies every day, actually become one with this artificial skin, connecting us deeply to the material world we live in. The objects themselves aren't the stories we remember, but they are the set pieces, and Cobb places them in a state that is somewhere inside of us and somewhere out, at once real and unfathomable, like memory itself.\nThis practice can get quite uncomfortable. The blankets she freezes in \"Pale Days\" and \"Afterword\" turn from soft and cozy to hard and untouchable. These are the witnesses to our lives— our sweaty nightmares and steamy sex scenes — and there they are hanging on the wall for everyone to see. Innocence disappears along with privacy. Personal impressions are fleshed out, as literally as possible, and exposed.\nThe show's most ambitious piece, \"A Few Steps Back,\" has as its base material a six-drawer dresser of the kind found in a little girl's bedroom. On top sit toys a girl might favor — horses, kittens and lambs.\nIt, too, oozes in Cobb's plastic pour, contorting from adorable to barely appropriate for display. Who are we to consider this object from a child's bedroom, in public.\nAmber Cobb starts with familiar objects, such as bath mats, and covers them in silicone. This work, \"Bob,\" is on display at Gildar Gallery. ( Image provided by Gildar Gallery ) But it is part of memory, and this is what Cobb is exploring, giving up, if you will. It has seen a lot, everything, whatever, and it testifies, fallibly though, the best it can. The object belongs in a museum.\nConversely, Williams starts in the opposite direction, outdoors. Her oil paintings are landscapes at their core — mountains, plains, skies. They are a familiar starting point in Colorado where people connect so easily to the surrounding scenery and artists of all stripes are compelled to render it on a canvas.\nBut Williams, showing now at Goodwin Fine Art , stops short of giving us anything fully recognizable like a postcard. Her brush strokes can be precise, but also freewheeling. There's a blurring of lines and an ambiguity of forms that keeps her scenes from being so representational.\nNo longer anchored in the real world, they feel more like vague memories from some wilderness journey or a night of stargazing, or scenes pulled from the imagination.\nThat allows Williams to take them anywhere — and she does. Natural occurrences, including clouds or dust storms, become both stunning and threatening in paintings such as \"Phosphenes.\" Otherwordly beings appear in \"Unwitnessed Event,\" and they don't look friendly.\nWilliams plays with surfaces, too. Raindrops or watermarks appear on the top layer of paintings, including the skyscape \"Reverberation.\" They become indiscernible from the dots of stars in the background, melding fact into fiction, the present tense of a downpour into the timelessness of the Milky Way.\nThere's a thin line, or no line, between what's tangible and what never happened or couldn't. As with Cobb's objects, you don't always know what William's paintings are saying.\nBut that's because so much of it is unsayable, impossible to document or prove through the usual methods of evidence gathering, photographs or human testimony.\nThese are stories that exist in the mind. And they can only be told through art.\nRay Mark Rinaldi: 303-954-1540, rrinaldi@denverpost.com or @rayrinaldi\nPHENOMENA\nGoodwin Fine Art presents recent paintings by Ashley Eliza Williams.
