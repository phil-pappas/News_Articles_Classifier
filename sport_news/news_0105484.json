Kee, 57, who has been city manager since September 2010, will officially retire Nov. 1. But the new contract will allow him to continue as manager another six months, through April 29. The six-month contract, which Kee proposed, saves the city nearly $2,000 per month in contributions to his PERS retirement account. Kee also will help the city recruit his replacement. Councilor Richard Langrell was not in favor of the new terms. “Normally, the interim city manager’s contracts are just until we find a new city manager,” Langrell said. “Would you have a problem changing this so it’s just until we find a replacement...and that replacement is ready?” Kee said he believes the recruitment process will take six months and that the contract he put forward is the only contract he is proposing. Langrell asked why Kee didn’t just retire in six months. Kee said he proposed the temporary contract because it saves the city money in PERS contributions. “What I was hoping and one thing the Council might consider is there would be a substantial savings by me retiring (Nov. 1),” Kee said. “The Council could choose to use that money for the search of a new city manager.” Langrell said “So, basically, the whole reason then...for retiring now and then being hired on a contract for another six months is so that you can put in for your retirement six months early?” Kee said it really doesn’t have anything to do with his retirement and that the Council would see no difference except that they wouldn’t be paying into his PERS. “What I do with my retirement isn’t really isn’t at issue for the Council, what’s in front of the Council is whether they want to have a six-month contract with Mike Kee and not pay in to the PERS system, or do something different,” Kee said. Langrell asked Kee whether, by retiring Nov. 1, he would collect his retirement and a salary from the city for six months. Oregon law does allow certain public employees to earn a salary from a public agency, and collect a PERS check, for a limited period. Kee said he was not asking the council to approve of his retirement. He was asking if they want to hire him for another six months.
