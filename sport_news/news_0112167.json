Only the names change. \nSeager will be around a long time. If he's lucky, he'll get 17 seasons in the big leagues, find his way to a World Series ring and a standing ovation on his way out the door. Howie Kendrick might have whistled the last pitch of Hudson's career into center field for a single, but that did not dampen the applause as he doffed his cap to a standing ovation in the third inning of the Giants' 3-2 loss to the Dodgers at AT&T Park.

The Giants lined up on the field near the dugout and formed a hug line for Hudson, whose bald head glistened in the sunshine. He retires with 222 victories, the most among active pitchers. \nBy the time the book closed on his career, Hudson allowed three runs in 2﻿1/3 innings. He entered with a 3.49 ERA. Thursday's events didn't change it. \nRyan Vogelsong, who most certainly is not retiring, displayed crisp stuff in what might have been his final appearance as a Giant. An impending free agent who could find his way back as a long reliever next season, Vogelsong allowed just one hit in four innings, struck out six and did not walk a batter.

They will fete Hudson at 12:45 p.m. on Saturday; they will send off Affeldt at 11:30 a.m. Sunday. \nMadison Bumgarner will not start Sunday's season finale, Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. Bumgarner went 18-9 with a 2.93 ERA in 32 starts while pitching 218﻿1/3 innings — one more inning than his previous regular-season career high last year. Of course, Bumgarner threw 270 innings between the regular season and postseason last year. \n\"He's good with it,\" Bochy said. \"He's done enough.\" \nYusmeiro Petit could start in Bumgarner's place unless he's needed earlier, Bochy said. \nBochy followed a heartfelt tribute to Affeldt by saying, \"I'm certainly going to miss those beautiful scuds he threw.\" The manager also asked media members for a synopsis of Affeldt's farewell news conference. \"I didn't get a chance to listen. Did he talk about his hitting?\" For more on the Giants, see the Giants Extra blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/Giants .
