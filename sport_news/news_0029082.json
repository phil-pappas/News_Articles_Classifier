They fled through fields and forests before finding sanctuary, first in a monastery and later in Namh Khan camp for displaced people in neighbouring Shan state. The camp provides a temporary home for some of the thousands of people displaced by conflict in this part of Myanmar.\nPhotograph: Chris Terry/WFP 2014\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Myanmar Everyone is in good health, but Oo Eain says that food is the family’s main priority. ‘So long as we have rice, we can manage,’ she says. ‘When we have rice in our house, we housewives don’t worry. We can think of the curries and other foods later. Rice is the most important thing.’ When asked what the family meal means to her, Oo Eain said: ‘It’s like a village meeting for our community. In our family, meal time is the only time of day when we’re all together.’ Today’s main meal is fried potatoes with garlic and tomato, spiced water spinach, chickpea soup and some rice.\nPhotograph: Chris Terry/WFP 2014\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Jordan When shrapnel hit Abu Sayid’s home in Daraa two years ago, the father of four knew he had to make the tough decision to get his family out of Syria. ‘We left with nothing but the clothes on our back, with just one aim – getting to safety,’ Abu Sayid explains. Arriving in Zaatari, they were struck by the harsh reality of living in a tent in a large swathe of arid land – a far cry from the home they had in Daraa.’ Today, life has improved for Abu Sayid as the camp has developed into a city-like site with its own markets and small businesses.\nPhotograph: Chris Terry/WFP 2014\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Jordan Huddled on the floor, Syrian refugee Abu Sayid reminisces about the journey from his hometown of Daraa to Jordan’s Zaatari camp while helping his wife prepare staple Syrian dishes – kubbeh and shishbarak dumplings. The first consists of bulgur wheat balls stuffed with mincemeat and onions, and the other is a thin dough with mincemeat filling cooked in a yoghurt stew. For refugees like Abu Sayid and his family cooking is not only a means of survival, it helps them remember life back home.\nPhotograph: Chris Terry/WFP 2014\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Chad Three years ago, Achta lived with her husband and their nine children in the small rural village of Dadabaye, in northern Chad. Before drought came to the region, Achta’s husband was a successful farmer. ‘It killed all our animals and everyone in the village started to leave,’ she says. After a long journey, the family found refuge in Arada, a small town in the east of the country. ‘But, unfortunately, poverty followed us there,’ Achta says. To help his family survive, Achta’s husband decided to go to Libya to find work. ‘It’s one and a half years ago. I have not heard from him since.’\nPhotograph: Chris Terry/WFP 2014\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Chad Achta prepares Ech bbe mula kawal , a traditional Chadian dish consisting of couscous and sorghum flour, served with gumbo sauce. ‘We always have a meal as a family.

What do meals mean for this family? ‘In Colombia, we say: Los tres golpes (the three blows): breakfast, lunch, and dinner – which no one forgets. The most sacred hour is mealtime. Even if we are seated on the floor, at seven at night we are together, united here, eating what I cooked that day. First, we always say a prayer to God to thank him for our food. We also give thanks for the fact that we are all still together, including my eldest son.’\nPhotograph: Chris Terry/WFP 2014\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Ecuador Lucilla prepares lunch with half a chicken, two tomatoes, two red onions, yuca, potatoes, and a little bit of colour with some achiote powder from their native Colombia.

I also don’t need to borrow money from friends or take out a loan. I grow millet and some vegetables for sale at the market. I cultivate my own land that I inherited from my father,’ Daouda says proudly. When asked what the family meal means to them, he replies: ‘Being able to provide a family meal makes me happy and proud.
