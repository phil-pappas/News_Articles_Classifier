This win sets up a match up with the Prescott Badgers next week in Prescott for the right to Section VIII, and it seems as though the Marauders are clicking on all cylinders heading into next Friday. Coming into Friday night, the Marauders had won five in a row since losing to Peoria, they also pitched two shutouts the past two games. Friday night almost made three, but with 30-seconds left in the fourth quarter Flagstaff quarterback Christian Singleton found C.J. Tompkins for a 9-yard pass touchdown that got the Eagles on the board. Other than that touchdown it was all Mingus, all night, as they were able to put up 41-points on an Eagles team that had defeated Prescott 36-6 last Friday night. After taking last week off with a back injury, Jordan Upham returned Friday night, and was the first Marauder to put points up on the board. Upham scampered into the end zone from 3-yards out. Upham did it all Friday night. On seven carries he racked up 38 yards and got into the end zone the twice on the ground. Upham also caught a 40-yard pass from Trey Meyer for a receiving touchdown. After Upham's first touchdown of the night, it was Alec Phyfer who found the end zone next. Running his way in from five-yards out. After a successful two-point conversion the Marauders were up 14-0 with eight minutes to go in the second quarter. The Marauders were quiet the rest of the quarter until Meyer found Upham on their 40-yard pitch and catch to put up seven more points on the scoreboard. The Marauders went into the half up 21-0, and they came out just as strong in the second half. At the 7:50 mark in the third quarter Upham found the end zone again, his third of the game. This time he maneuvered his way in from seven yards out to put the Marauders up 28-0. Mingus was kept out of the end zone the rest of the third quarter. Two minutes into the fourth the Marauders struck again, this time it was senior Pete Kelly. Kelly, who finished with 30 yards on five carries, broke off an 18-yard touchdown run, his second of the season. Anthony Accurso finished off the scoring for the Marauders six minutes later. The senior tail back cracked off a 15-yard touchdown run, his eighth of the season. Accurso was one of eight Marauders to run the ball Friday night, finishing with six carries for 32 yards. Junior Juan Ruiz led the Marauders in carries with 11 as the Marauders racked up 370 yards on the ground. Senior Tristan Clark led the way with 88 yards on 8 carries, and Trey Meyer finished with 68. Cole Phelps also contributed with four carries for Mingus. The Marauders were just as devastating on defense, as both Kelly brothers, Tyler and Pete, got to the Flagstaff quarterback once a piece. Pete brought down the quarterback for an 8-yard loss, his 8.5 sack on the season. He also was able to cause a fumble on a blocked punt for Mingus. Tyler got to the quarterback for a 10-yard loss. With 10.5 sacks on the season, the younger Kelly brother has the 10th most sacks in Division III heading into the final week of regular season play. Junior Alejandro Stabreff also picked off a pass for the stifling Marauders defense which was his first of the year. Next week the Marauders head into Prescott to take on the Badgers. Friday night the Badgers took down two-time section champion Bradshaw Mountain 30-13. The two teams will battle for the Division III Section VIII championship and a playoff bid as the season comes to a close. In the most recent AIA standings the Marauders currently sit at #12 while the Badgers sit at #26 but are more than likely going to move up after a convincing win over the Bears of Bradshaw Mountain. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. on Friday in Prescott. -- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee and Instagram @VerdeValleyNews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:51:30.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
