Friday night, the Dutchmen battled through a series of miscues as the growth and maturation process over the past month since a lopsided loss to Saratoga showed through as Guilderland clinched its first home playoff berth since 2007.\nJunior quarterback George Marinopoulos tossed two touchdown passes in the first half and the Dutchmen survived three bad punt snaps to produce a 21-9 Class AA Empire Division victory against Shenendehowa. The win secured the division's No. 2 playoff seed.\n\"We made some mistakes with the punting game, things we will have to get figured out for next week,\" Guilderland coach Dan Penna said. \"The little things are going to mean more now.\"\nGuilderland (6-1 overall, 4-1 Empire Division) fell apart in Week 3 when Saratoga scored the final 40 points in a 40-7 triumph. Penna said the team practiced poorly that week and it carried over into the loss to the Blue Streaks. Friday, Guilderland made some glaring mistakes, except this time they fought through to produce several huge plays and the season's biggest win.\nIn 2014, the Dutchmen missed the playoffs and finished 2-7 overall. Next week, Guilderland will play host to No. 3 Liberty Division seed Columbia (4-3, 3-2) in the Class AA quarterfinals.\n\"This is my senior year. I want to go out with a bang,\" Guilderland defensive tackle Marquis Chisom said. \"I am very proud. I've been on this team since I was a sophomore. The last time we beat Shen, it was here (in 2013).\"\n\"I think we're capable of going all the way,\" Guilderland fullback/linebacker Patrick Ghyll said.\nGuilderland led 14-0 at halftime, but the advantage easily could have been much more. The teams combined for five first-half turnovers, including two by the Dutchmen. Shenendehowa (3-4, 3-2) was backed up deep in its own territory for the majority of the opening 24 minutes â€” with half of the eight offensive series starting for the Plainsmen between their 12 and 17-yard lines.\n\"I think we played really good defense. We made some mistakes on offense, but we shut them down,\" Ghyll said.\nShenendehowa fumbled away the ball twice, with Cameron Long and Ghyll making the recoveries, and junior quarterback Mike Spulnick (8-for-23 for 45 yards) also had a pass intercepted by Guilderland linebacker Tyler Hess late in the second half.\nMarinopoulos, who opened the scoring with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Spiro Sokaris in the first quarter, connected with Ghyll on a swing pass for a five-yard touchdown with 26 seconds left in the second quarter.\nWhen the Dutchmen lost to Saratoga, the mistakes started, didn't stop and no one really stepped forward to make a big play. This time, Guilderland answered back after their special teams unit suffered through a rough second half.\n\"We had to bring each other back up and keep focused,\" Ghyll said.\nThe Dutchmen drove down the field on their first possession of the third quarter and Long capped the series with a 24-yard touchdown run untouched up the middle. Jake Wheeler's third extra-point boot made it 21-0.\nShenendehowa's defense stiffened from that point on and forced Guilderland to punt. Three straight attempts, however, never materialized. The first snap bounced back to Wheeler, who put his knee on the ground when fielding the ball on the 16. Three plays later, Shenendehowa's Nick Cosgrove scored on an 11-yard run as the Plainsmen shaved their deficit to 21-7.\nAnother bad snap to Wheeler on the next series provided Shen with the ball deep in Guilderland territory. Ghyll prevented another short-field scoring drive when he intercepted a fourth-down pass in the end zone.\nThe Dutchmen later had another series stall out quickly. Again, the Dutchmen lined up to punt. Wheeler watched the ball sail well over his head and into the end zone. The senior proceeded to kick the ball out of bounds for a Shenendehowa safety.\nShenendehowa never generated a sustained drive as Guilderland's defense, led by Ghyll (three solo stops, five assisted tackles, one interception, one sack and a fumble recovery), Chisom and Hess limited the Plainsmen to 203 yards of offense. Shenendehowa, which will play next week at La Salle, converted just one of 12 third-down opportunities and went 0-for-4 on fourth down.\n\"We grinded hard all week and stayed on each other's backs. I think that helped us succeed on defense,\" Chisom said. \"They had some runs up the middle, but we ... made some big plays.\"\njallen@timesunion.com â€¢ 518-454-5062 â€¢ @TUSidelines", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805471/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/57/8805348/7/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805458/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805460/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805464/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/57/8805348/7/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805471/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805471/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805469/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805462/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805455/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/57/8805348/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805462/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805464/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805467/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805469/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805456/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805460/7/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805469/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805455/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805462/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805456/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805460/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805467/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805458/7/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805455/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805467/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805458/7/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805464/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/61/8805456/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:23:58.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
