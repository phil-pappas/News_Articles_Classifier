A full schedule, but that's what she signed up for. \nAnd it's not just in athletics. In her senior year Sarah is taking five college level courses and she has a 3.7 GPA. \n\"She's always on the court and yet always has her academics at the top level,\" said Harpursville volleyball head coach Tim Strantz. \nBack to those athletics though. That whole playing three sports things has its benefits. \n\"She's got the ability to jump really high, she's got a rocket for an arm,\" said Strantz. \"I mean, she's just an amazing all around athlete.\" \n\"My Mom, I think she really wanted to make sure that I found something that I was good at and she always made sure I had lots to do when I was little,\" said Miller. \"I played civic softball, civic basketball and I went to volleyball tournaments when I was little. I guess she wanted me to pick one, but I stuck with all three and I loved all of them.\" \nVolleyball was her best sport. She holds the school record for kills with over 700 during her career, and it's no surprise she's a team captain. \n\"She is able to kind of run the offense and the defense,\" said Strantz of Miller. \"She can pick out on the other side of the court their weaknesses, their strengths. She can exploit them and use them to our advantage. She tells the other girls on the team what she notices.\" \n\"If you watch me you're always seeing me talking to my teammates and telling them what they could be doing and just trying to pick them up,\" said Sarah. \n\"Her behavior on and off the court is so tremendous that the other girls really look up to her skills and stuff,\" said Strantz. \"I think they really try to follow that example.\" \nWe don't have it in a dictionary or anything, but if we did, what her coach just said would be our definition of an Academic All-Star. That's exactly what Sarah Miller is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:31:48.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
