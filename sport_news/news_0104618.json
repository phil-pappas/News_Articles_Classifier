Many coaches encourage their quarterbacks to seek additional work with private gurus. Most view it as an opportunity for an eager player to improve, but not every coach feels that way.\nThe lone holdout in the SEC is Auburn's Gus Malzahn, who faces a quarterback quandary halfway through his third season leading the Tigers.\nWhy doesn't Malzahn let his quarterbacks work with a private coach?\n\"Well, it's been that way for a long time,\" Malzahn said. \"We just really want our guys within our system. You get a lot of different ideas from outsiders that don't fit within your system and sometimes it can be confusing.\"\nMalzahn developed his Hurry-Up, No-Huddle system during his high school coaching days Shiloh (Arkansas) Christian in the late 1990s. The terminology is different from typical offenses in college and the NFL, but the verbiage elsewhere is beginning to be simplified.\nHow different is Auburn's system?\nFormer Auburn quarterback Cam Newton was challenged -- and befuddled -- when asked to verbalize a complex play call during an interview with ESPN analyst Jon Gruden, a former quarterback guru in the NFL, in the spring of 2011.\n\"Our method is simplistic equals fast,\" Newton told Gruden. \"It's so simple as far as you look to the sideline and you see 36 on the board, and that's a play. And we're off.\"\nNewton was later selected first overall in the NFL Draft despite the perceived weakness handling NFL verbiage.\nThe central argument between Auburn and private quarterback coaches is simple: the gurus believe they're improving mechanics; Auburn does its own thing with mechanics inside its own system. Again, Malzahn doesn't want to confuse his quarterbacks. Most private coaches, however, don't muddy the process or require quarterbacks to learn new systems or play calls.\nAuburn quarterback Sean White worked several years with Ken Mastrole, a former University of Maryland quarterback, but was ordered by Malzahn to cease workouts with the private quarterbacks coach in 2014.\n\"Growing up, (Mastrole) helped me with my mechanics and everything and a lot of the mental part of the game,\" said White,a redshirt freshman. \"He's prepared me for college football. Now that I'm here, coach Malzhan does a great job preparing me.\"\nWhite supplanted Jeremy Johnson as Auburn's starter in Week 4, but Malzahn has not yet committed to White as a full-time starter as the Tigers eye a trip to Kentucky on Thursday. Mastrole maintains a friendship with White's family, but the training days are over.\n\"I kinda respect that in some terms of a program because this quarterback business has evolved so much,\" Mastrole said. \"Honestly, there are a lot of guys out there doing more harm than good. In terms of training, I think it's 'What's the purpose? What are you trying to accomplish?' Anybody can do these hokey-pokey cone drills and spike stuff.\"\nThe concerns many coaches have at the quarterback position relate directly to time. There's only so many hours in the week and during the offseason the NCAA allows coaches to work with a player to repair mistakes and fundamentals. It's why many coaches encourage their players to seek guidance from private coaches such as George Whitfield, who many have labeled the \"quarterback whisperer.\" Now an ESPN analyst, Whitfield has trained the likes of Heisman Trophy winners Jameis Winston and Johnny Manziel, and finalist Andrew Luck.\n\"I'm speaking generically: why would you not want players to get reps?\" Whitfield said. \"Imagine a baseball team where you're only going to take batting practice when the team practices and that's it. ... What if you're weak on inside pitches but you can only swing a bat when your coaches are there? That's what we're talking about here. Progress is predicated on reps.\"\nWhitfield's thoughts were echoed by every SEC head coach polled by AL.com. Mississippi State's Dan Mullen is the only coach to nearly echo Malzahn's thoughts on private quarterback coaches. Mullen coached Heisman winner Tim Tebow at Florida and is in his fourth year coaching Dak Prescott, who may go down as the best quarterback in Mississippi State history.\n\"I haven't really had many of my guys do it,\" Mullen said. \"I think I'm a pretty good quarterback coach. I know Brian Johnson is an excellent quarterback coach. I think our guys feel they get really good coaching while they're here and we develop quarterbacks as good as anybody in America.\"\nSeveral SEC coaches said outside training improved their quarterbacks. Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze pointed to Bo Wallace and Ryan Buchanan's strides as examples. Mark Stoops believes Patrick Towles has improved thanks to private coaching.\n\"For the most part, I've seen guys improve doing this,\" Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \"We've never had an issue with any conflict of a guy coming back and saying, 'Well, my coach told me to do this and you're telling me to do that.' We've never seen or had that. It hasn't been an issue for us.\"\nTennessee quarterback Joshua Dobbs worked with a personal coach in the summer, but coach Butch Jones admitted there are some concerns. \"Sometimes when you go to an outside trainer, with them not understanding the offense and what you're trying to accomplish, sometimes you have to do some work when (the quarterback) returns,\" Jones said.\nMalzahn's most successful quarterbacks either transferred from a junior college or spent two years or less in the Hurry-Up, No-Huddle system.\nNo college quarterback has spent more time in Malzahn's system than Johnson, who entered his third season as a preseason second team All-SEC selection and a Heisman candidate. He was benched after throwing six interceptions -- then tied for most in the FBS -- in the first three games.\nWhite took over in Week 4 and has thrown for 296 yards on 26 of 38 passing, but has yet to score a touchdown. The redshirt freshman still talks to Mastrole, but X's and O's are no longer the topic of conversation.\n\"You want guys doing the exact things that you do in your offense fundamentally,\" Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee said. \"There's a lot of different ways to do things -- a lot of different, good ways to do things -- but you want them to do it your way, within your system. You don't want a lot of clutter. You want one voice. It's nothing negative toward someone else.\"\nMastrole said he understands, \"appreciates and respects\" the decision, but added Auburn coaches know he maintains a relationship with White.\nWhite is not the only quarterback to seek outside guidance without Malzahn's permission.\nFormer Auburn quarterback Nick Marshall contemplated a training stint with Whitfield following the Tigers' trip to the BCS National Championship in January 2014, but Malzahn quickly stepped in and ended those discussions .\nMarshall's stats (2,532 yards, 20 touchdowns, seven interceptions on 60.8 percent passing) improved slightly in 2014, but his rushing totals (798 yards) dropped 25.3 percent. He threw for an Auburn record 456 yards in a 55-44 loss to Alabama in the Iron Bowl, but failed to reach offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee's season-long goal of completing 65 percent of his passes. Marshall moved to cornerback for the Senior Bowl in January and was signed as a defensive back by the Jacksonville Jaguars as an undrafted free agent.\nMalzahn shows no signs of joining his SEC brethren by loosening his restrictions, though he previously allowed defensive linemen to seek training in the offseason with Chuck Smith, a private coach in Atlanta.\nAuburn quarterbacks Sean White (left), Nick Marshall and Jeremy Johnson (right) are shown at Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn, Ala, Saturday, Sept. 6, 2014. (Mark Almond/malmond@al.com) The quarterback position is more nuanced and important, however, and it's why quarterback camps have become big business in recent years. No other skill position player touches the ball more often than the quarterback. If good enough, the face of the program can mask weaknesses elsewhere on the roster with strong performances. It's why several of Auburn's SEC rivals encourage their players to seek private coaches when the NCAA limits their practice time.\n\"To me it's the sign of a guy wanting to get better and a guy wanting to improve some phase of his game,\" Georgia coach Mark Richt said. \"The sharper a guy is fundamentally, the better he'll react when the heat is on. We've never had a problem with that.\"\nSimulating game-day situations is key for private coaches selling their product. After all, it's hard to simulate a game without, well, a game.\nWhitfield uses brooms and other instruments to disrupt passing lanes in training sessions. He also places quarterbacks in the ocean to work on three- and five-step drops. The unorthodox approach is his way of harassing players without risking injury, and it has proven successful.\nIt's quite different at practices on campuses across the country, Whitfield said. Coaches spend most of their time installing the game plan and working their quarterbacks in \"serene\" environments. The focus is on perfecting plays and not stressing their quarterbacks. It leaves little time for development.\n\"Your quarterback will spend more time with your strength and conditioning staff than he will with your quarterback coach,\" Whitfield said. \"I get it. When you say the quarterback at University X will only work with University X coaches, it's a sign for support of your staff. You're making a declaration and you're sending a signal to your kids. We recruited you, we brought you in, we have the best in mind for you, we want the best for you. All those things are true, but all those things are limited.\"\nWho throws it best?
