ROCKFORD — It was an offer she could refuse. Auburn senior Emma Lai had a chance to play doubles with Meghan Mediratta, the 2013 sectional singles champ. That guaranteed her a much better chance to win, but Lai said no. Repeatedly. \"Meghan wants to go far, but I mainly do tennis as recreation,\" Lai said. \"I want to have as much fun as possible. In singles, even though I wouldn't get far, I'd get to play these amazing players that I would never dream of beating.\" She'd enjoy that, even if she lost. And she'd still do fine at singles. Last year, both advanced to state in singles, with Mediratta taking third in sectionals as a junior and Lai fourth as a sophomore, losing 6-4, 6-1 to Mediratta. But at doubles, they would clearly be better, as they proved last week by winning the NIC-10 title. Lai and Mediratta are now favored Friday and Saturday at the Harlem Sectional. \"I had never played doubles before, so I had a lot of apprehension about trying something new,\" said Lai, who took several months to convince. Mediratta talked to Lai about it most of last season, then again over the winter, and into this summer when they would play. \"She had her mind set on singles,\" Mediratta said. \"I had to give her a good list of why we should play doubles together to convince her.\" \"Some kids,\" Auburn coach Tracy Palmer said, \"really get it in their minds that they want to play singles. They don't want to be responsible for making a mistake with their teammate. They don't want that burden. When it's singles, it's all about you. There is no one else to blame.\" \"That was definitely part of it,\" Lai agreed. \"I don't trust myself.\" Especially at the net, a place she rarely ventured to in singles. \"My net game was very weak to begin with,\" she said. \"I wasn't confident in my reflexes.\" But that's Mediratta's favorite part of tennis. \"I like being at the net a lot,\" she said. \"I like that quick pace.\" Lai and Mediratta lost twice during conference play, once when Boylan's two-time NIC-10 singles champ Ana Hatfield moved to doubles in their dual meet and a three-set loss to Guilford's Carly Kasicki and Kristin Weyburg, who went 9-0 during NIC-10 regular season play. But Lai and Mediratta also won all three of the weekend tournaments they entered. They are now 4-for-4 after beating Kasicki and Weyburg 6-4, 6-0 for the NIC-10 title at No. 1 doubles. Palmer thinks his reluctant star pairing is hitting their stride at the perfect time. \"When players switch to doubles, they have to change their game a lot,\" Palmer said. \"They have to work on angles and volleys.\" Page 2 of 2 - Lai has made that change. \"I am really liking doubles now,\" Lai said.
