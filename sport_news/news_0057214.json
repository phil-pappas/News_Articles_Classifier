And I say good for you, Cam. Good for you for honoring your late father who was a great player in the NFL,\" Fox Sports' Mike Pereira said . \nA source told NBC Sports the league won't increase the fines past that $11,000 mark and the NFL won't stop Heyward from taking the field. \nHowever, the fines will continue if Heyward keeps defying the league's uniform policy. \nThe NFL has come under fire these past few weeks for its strict enforcement of uniform rules. \nLast week, Heyward's teammate, running back DeAngelo Williams, was told by the league he couldn't wear pink accessories throughout the season to honor his late mother.

Outside of that, though, the league doesn't budge. \nHeyward told ESPN he isn't trying be difficult, but wants to keep wearing the personalized eye black. He's currently appealing the NFL's first fine. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:32:23.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
