Yankees secure place in playoffs 1 / 2 Back to Gallery New York\nCC Sabathia stood near his locker in the back of the oval Yankees clubhouse while excited teammates celebrated New York's return to the postseason.\n\"It feels like an eternity,\" the big left-hander said, not trying to hide his relief.\nWith some help from the one of the old guard, the next generation of Yankees will have a chance to make their mark in the playoffs.\nEnding a rare two-year absence from the postseason, New York clinched a wild-card berth with three games to spare by beating the Boston Red Sox 4-1 Thursday night for the franchise's 10,000th regular-season win.\nPutting behind the venerated teams of Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera , New York (87-72) opens its 52nd postseason with a winner-take-all game on Tuesday. The Yankees most likely will face Houston or the Los Angeles Angels.\n\"We'll never forget what Derek did for this organization,\" manager Joe Girardi said, \"but you have to move on. Yogi retired. Mickey Mantle retired and Joe D retired â€” all these guys, they were great players, but the Yankees continued to win.\"\nMasahiro Tanaka is lined up to pitch the wild-card game, with the winner advancing to a Division Series against East champion Toronto or Central winner Kansas City.\nCarlos Beltran homered along with rookies Greg Bird and Rob Refsnyder. Sabathia (6-10) allowed one run in five innings to win for the second time since the All-Star break.\nNew York had failed to reach the playoffs in consecutive years for the first time since its 1982-93 drought, just before a run that included five World Series titles and seven AL pennants from 1996-2009.\nIn their latest postseason, in 2012, the Yanks were swept by Detroit in the ALCS. Among the players on that team, only Alex Rodriguez , Brett Gardner , Mark Teixeira and Sabathia remain, and Teixeira will miss this postseason due to a broken leg.\nNow Beltran, Jacoby Ellsbury , Chase Headley , Brian McCann and Didi Gregorius support a creaky starting rotation, a strong back end of the bullpen and sputtering middle relievers. The 40-year-old Rodriguez hit 33 home runs after serving a drug suspension last season.\n\"It's kind of fitting that the 10,000th win clinches a postseason berth,\" Gardner said.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/31/8726106/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/31/8726106/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/31/8726107/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/31/8726107/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:48:20.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
