Cozens on October 9,   \nThe Harvey School girls varsity volleyball ended a nine-year winless streak against The Masters School of New York by defeating the Lady Panthers, 3-2, on Thursday on their home court in Dobbs Ferry. Setter Tess Knorr was instrumental to the Harvey vollyeball team’s win on Thursday over The Masters School. \nAfter one of the hardest-fought matches of the year, the Cavs came away with the victory, battling back from a 2-1 deficit and taking the match with two consecutive wins. \nMasters opened the match with a 25-22 victory in a nail-biter. Harvey then fought back to tie the match with a 25-22 victory in the second set. After Masters won the second set convincingly, 25-17, Harvey fought back to take sets four and five with scores of 25-14 and 15-8. \nHarvey setter Tessa Knorr ran a ‘5-1’ offense for her first time for the entire match. Sasha Fox and Sara Steinberg handled the middle hitting and blocking while Kat Panginis, Rebecca Teuter, Jordan Carnan–Raimey, Kylene Groff and Safia Gecaj took care of the outside hitting and blocking. Claudia Smith and Danni Qu anchored the defense. \n“We had a great serving match, with exceptional serving from Sasha, Sara and Tessa,” said Coach Dave Ketner. “The match was a true team victory, with every girl on the team doing her job extremely well.” \nHarvey’s next match is next Wednesday on the road against Wooster.
