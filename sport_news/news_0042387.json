With their eighth consecutive win, thanks to a 7-2 trouncing of Buffalo Sabres Friday, Montreal became just the sixth team in NHL history to start the season 8-0-0. They're also inching ever closer to the all-time NHL record for most consecutive wins to start a season.\nSince we brought up the Stanley Cup, perhaps at the risk of raining on Montreal's parade, it bears mentioning that none of the other five teams to start the year 8-0-0 went on to win the title. On the other hand, the last time the Habs won eight consecutive games in regulation at any point in a season was Oct. 24-Nov. 11, 1992 (via @PR_NHL ). They ended that season hoisting the Stanley Cup for the 24th time. They're still looking for No. 25.\nTake nothing away from this start for the Habs, though. They absolutely belong in the Stanley Cup contender conversation as they've been outstanding to start. Their goal differential remains sparkling at plus-21, they're getting contributions from throughout the lineup and they even won both games Carey Price didn't start, including Friday night's contest. This team has not looked anything like last year's club that needed Price to do it all for them.\nHere's three things to know about the Habs' big win as they march toward NHL history.\n1. Montreal is two wins away from making NHL history \nYou have to figure that Montreal is going to lose eventually, right? If the Habs keep playing like this, maybe not. They've already made history within their own organization, now owning the longest winning streak to start a season in franchise history.\nTheir win Friday night also put them in elite company as one of only two NHL teams to have won their first eight games within regulation. The 1975-76 Buffalo Sabres club was the only other of the six teams that started 8-0-0 to win all eight within the allotted 60 minutes.\nHowever, to set the NHL's all-time record, the Canadiens will have to win two to tie and three to break the league's record for best start to a season.\nThe 1993-94 Toronto Maple Leafs and 2006-07 Buffalo Sabres each won 10 consecutive games to start their seasons. So that's the benchmark the 2015-16 Canadiens will have to match or surpass to have this remembered as the greatest start in the history of the game. Their next two contests are against the Maple Leafs at home and the Vancouver Canucks on the road. A potential record-breaking game would come against the Edmonton Oilers on the road.\nWhen you look at the parity in the league today and the fact that teams so often are still getting their legs under them to start the season, there is nothing about this Canadiens' start that isn't special.\n2. Andrei Markov went off for a career night \nAndrei Markov is 36 years old and has been a Montreal Canadien for his entire career. However, he's never had a night as good as the one he did Friday against the Sabres. Markov set a career high with five points in the game including one goal and four assists.\nHis goal came on an absolute rocket following a crafty faceoff win from Tomas Plekanec in which he used his skate to kick the puck back to Markov.\n\nComing into Friday night's contest, Markov already had four points, all assists. Now he leads all NHL defensemen with nine points.\nWith P.K. Subban on the roster, it's easy to forget about how impactful Markov is for this team. He had 50 points last season for crying out loud. He's well on his way to another massive point total this year.\nBy the way, Markov's fourth point of the night gave him 500 in his career. He is only the third Habs defenseman in franchise history to collect 500-plus points with the club, joining Larry Robinson and Guy Lapointe ( via @PR_NHL ). Pretty remarkable.\n3. Markov was one of six Habs to post multi-point nights \nThe Habs took complete advantage of the Sabres Friday night and had their way with goaltender Chad Johnson . Six of the Habs ended the night with multiple points. Markov led the way with five, but both Brendan Gallagher and Dale Weise had two goals. Both Tomas Plekanec and P.K. Subban had three assists apiece and Max Pacioretty added a goal and an assist.\nAnother statline of note, backup goalie Mike Condon made 34 saves on 36 shots. Poor Chad Johnson at the other end of the ice stopped 19 of 26 shots, finishing the night with a save percentage of .731. Montreal was just too good. Montreal earned their eighth straight win Friday in Buffalo. (USATSI) Topics: Andrei Markov , Brendan Gallagher , Carey Price , Chad Johnson , Dale Weise , Max Pacioretty , Mike Condon , P.K.
