While all previous cork editions have been designed more for wear off the court, the latest appears to be game ready.\nHaving a sneaker made from cork material doesn't seem like it would be very durable for playing in, so this version limits the cork usage to the tongue and heel. This design detail is combined with a grey and wine colorway, and wine label-inspired branding on the insole. This could represent the next phase in the cork series by taking inspiration from an entire wine bottle.\nNo release details are available yet.\nvia sample_gang", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/sample_gang/"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:24:26.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
