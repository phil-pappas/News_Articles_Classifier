Ask the experts! \nJames Franklin, Penn State head coach \nOn the game \n“We had some real opportunities early in the game. The touchdown called back by penalty was significant, especially at that point. Our defense was playing well and our offense was moving the ball, but we went able to capitalize.”\nOn poor field position \n“That was significant. Their punter was able to be aggressive and get the ball off, sky the punt and pin us deep numerous times.”\nlong.”\n \nTroy Reeder, senior linebacker \nOn Ohio State \n“Give a lot of credit to them, they have a lot of weapons on offense. They’re good team and they were well prepared, but we felt like we were well prepared too. We’re going to learn from this and move on.”\nOn tackling issues \n“With their skill, they took advantage of missed tackles. It wasn’t particular poor today, but they have weapons that, if you don’t get them down, will make you pay.”\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \n \nGarrett Sickels, Penn State defensive end \nOn Ohio State’s playmakers\n“I just think they have some awesome playmakers, some really good skill positions. It really comes back to us; we weren’t really focused. We just need to settle on our roles.”\nOn J.T. Barrett coming in\n“I would say things are more active when he comes in. We just have to settle down more and play our responsibilities better but they’re definitely more dynamic with him in there.”\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \n \nBrendan Mahon, Penn State offensive guard \nOn Saquon Barkley and Akeel Lynch \n“We have some of the best backs in the country. Their work ethic definitely shows throughout the week. A guy like Saquon can bust a big run and Akeel adds a little variety in the backfield.”\nOn being close at half \n“We went in the locker room and kind of regrouped. We wanted to come out firing in the second half and we did that, but the score at the end of the night kind of told it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:35:58.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
