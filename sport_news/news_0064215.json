Some (of our) players land today at 2pm so we have to check their fitness to see if there are no bad surprises,\" said Wenger. \n\"I cannot do a lot about it (Sanchez playing twice for Chile). \n\"He came off as you have seen against Manchester United with a hip problem, a problem with the rotator muscle and he wanted to go. \n\"He played in the last two games and we have to see how he comes back, but it is always a tricky situation. Chile are trying to qualify for the World Cup and he is an important player for them, but they will use him if they can. \n\"Alexis is a guy that always wants to play so I knew that was always going to be a tricky situation.\" \nWenger added: \"Let's see what happens and how he comes back. We have to see if we have to protect him in our next game or not.\" \nArsenal could be boosted by the return of centre-back Laurent Koscielny, who has been out since the end of September with a hamstring injury. \nMidfielders Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini are also in contention for Saturday's late kick-off at Watford. \nEngland duo Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck, meanwhile, continue their rehabilitation following leg and knee surgery respectively. \nWenger said: \"They are progressing well. Jack Wilshere is still one month away at least and Danny Welbeck at the earliest will be back (at the) beginning of January.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:07:39.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
