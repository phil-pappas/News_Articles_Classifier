A dominant pitcher in the regular season, he fell to a 0-7 record in playoff starts. \nRoyals closer Wade survived a shaky ninth inning in which he gave up a leadoff single and then a walk. He struck out Ben Revere and Josh Donaldson before Jose Bautista then flied out to right to give Davis his third postseason save and the Royals another postseason comeback win. \nThe reigning AL champs have won nine straight ALCS games dating to their memorable seven-game series against Toronto in 1985 — the year they won their only World Series. The record is 10 straight wins set by Baltimore in the 1970s and '80s. \nNow, the Blue Jays head home for Game 3 on Monday in dire trouble. All but three of the previous 25 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven era have won the series — though Toronto did rally from the same hole to beat the Rangers in five games in the divisional round. \nFor most of the game, it appeared the Blue Jays would tie the series. \nRyan Goins drove in a run off Kansas City starter Yordano Ventura in the third, snapping an 18-inning scoreless streak by Royals pitchers, and Edwin Encarnacion and Troy Tulowitzki had RBIs in the sixth. \nThe way Price was carving up the lineup, a 3-0 lead looked to be enough. \nHe threw first-pitch strikes to 12 of 14 batters at one point, and struck out the side in the sixth inning, giving no indication he was about to implode. \nThe Royals' rally began after a costly defensive lapse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:40:38.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
