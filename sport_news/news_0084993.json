What's even better is that the Bruins, and Krejci, expect even more. Krejci takes 4-5-9 totals into Wednesday night's game against the visiting Flyers, with five of those points scored during power plays. His four even-strength points (2 goals, 2 assists) aren't bad, but Krejci's new wingers haven't fared as well, especially recently. Neither David Pastrnak (1-2-3) nor Matt Beleskey (1-1-2) has scored in the past three games, and both are minus-3 for the season. \"They can definitely be better. They know that,\" said coach Claude Julien, quickly adding, \"this is not necessarily a negative critique … I think there's a little bit of everything on that line that, if it improves, will become a much bigger threat than it is right now.\" Julien and Krejci both think the line needs more time to mesh. Beleskey is a first-year Bruin who spent six years with the Ducks, while Pastrnak, only 19, is in just his second pro season. The latter led the Bruins last season with 26 second-half points (10 goals, 16 assists), but with Krejci battling injuries, the two rarely played together. \"There's one guy [Beleskey] who's kind of getting used to playing with [Krejci],\" Julien said. \"And as good a skater as [Pastrnak] is and all that stuff, he still … gets pushed off the puck, struggles in the battles sometimes. Once he gets a little bit better at protecting the puck, I think that'll help, also.\" Krejci, himself adjusting to the trade of long-time linemate Milan Lucic, thinks his new line will come around. \"Obviously, there's some stuff we've got to work on, and we've been trying,\" he said. \"I like it, but we know we can be a little better. \"The puck's not going in the net for us as a unit, but we're getting some good looks. We have to keep doing that … [Pastrnak and Beleskey] are really good players. It's just a matter of time before we'll find the right chemistry, and we'll start putting the puck in the net.\" AROUND THE BOARDS: Defenseman Joe Morrow is eligible to come off the injured reserve list, but that seems unlikely before Wednesday's game. Morrow, who came down with the flu after playing last Monday against the Lightning, was too sick to go on last week's trip to Colorado and Arizona, and couldn't practice until Tuesday. Morrow lost 10 pounds while he was sick. \"That's a lot of weight for a player,\" Julien said. \"He's got to find his strength, and after not skating for a week, he's got to get himself back into shape. Page 2 of 2 - We're going to allow him to work through that. You can't rush a guy back too quickly who's been sick to that extent.\" By MIKE LOFTUS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:05:17.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
