That was the third time in seven games UW (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten Conference) failed to rush for 100 yards.\n\"The frustrating thing is that they brought some stuff that maybe we weren't prepared for, loading the box up,\" said Voltz, who appears on track to return to the starting lineup this week at Illinois. \"And we just didn't make the right adjustments during the game to fit the plays up right...we were on the wrong guys, had the wrong targets.\"\nWith Voltz out for the first time all season, offensive coordinator Joe Rudolph moved redshirt freshman Michael Deiter to center from left guard. Redshirt freshman Micah Kapoi filled in for Deiter, and redshirt junior Walker Williams made his third start of the season at right guard. Redshirt freshman Beau Benzschawel got his second start at right tackle but did not perform as well as he did in his debut at Nebraska.\n\"It was a good learning experience for the young guys,\" Voltz said, \"for Michael playing center and seeing a defensive front you don't prepare for.\"\nPurdue generally played eight defenders near the line of scrimmage and three defensive linemen recorded at least one tackle for loss. End Evan Panfil led the way with three tackles for loss, five total tackles and a forced fumble.\n\"I thought there were some things early we did really well,\" Rudolph said, referring to the Badgers' 10-play, 81-yard touchdown drive to open the game. \"And I thought there were some adjustments we struggled with. I think that comes from a lot of things — new guys around you, communication —guys seeing everything.\"\nThe play of the line was not solely responsible for the lackluster running game against Purdue.\nUW's tight ends and wide receivers need to block more effectively. Running backs Dare Ogunbowale, who rushed 18 times for 56 yards against Purdue, and freshman Alec Ingold (9-19) missed holes against the Boilermakers.\n\"We've got to make sure we read our keys,\" Ogunbowale said, \"make sure we're looking at the right places pre-snap and trust that the hole is going to be there and keep pressing the hole.\n\"We got to make sure we keep working to correct that and make sure we try to minimize those errors.\"\nIllinois (4-2, 1-1) enters the weekend eighth in the Big Ten against the run, allowing an average of 151.3 yards per game.\nIf Voltz returns to the starting lineup, Deiter can move back to guard, which is his stronger position. If tailback Corey Clement (sports hernia) can return for the first time since the opener against Alabama, the running game should receive a boost.\n\"After each game watching the film can be frustrating,\" Voltz said. \"You leave certain plays out there. You're one block away from hitting a big run, one cut away from hitting a touchdown. That is frustrating.\n\"It is hard to put a full game together where everybody is on the same page, but that is what you strive for and that is what we're trying to do each week. Once we can put that together on a consistent basis I think we'll be hard to stop.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/336100021/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-23T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:58:18.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
