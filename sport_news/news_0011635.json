PETERSON AP Sports Writer   3:32   3:32   \nPeople: \nColorado (732) \n\nCORVALLIS, Oregon — Oregon State coach Gary Andersen hopes someday the Beavers can put this loss to Colorado in perspective. \n\"It's going to be a lot of fun, but right now it's not tough. It is what it is,\" Andersen said. \"But we'll remember these days, and we'll look back one day when we're winning games and taking care of business and say, 'Remember when?'\" \nSefo Liufau threw for 140 yards and a touchdown, and ran for another score, and Colorado snapped a 14-game losing streak in the Pac-12 with a 17-13 victory over Oregon State on Saturday night. \nColorado's last league win was on Nov. 16, 2013, when the Buffaloes beat Cal 41-24 in Boulder. The victory over the Beavers also snapped a 13-game losing streak on the road against conference foes, with the last coming on Sept. 22, 2012, at Washington State, 35-34. \nColorado (4-4, 1-3) had lost three straight, including last weekend's 38-31 loss to Arizona. \nRyan Nall ran for 122 yards and a touchdown for the Beavers (2-5, 0-4) who are the last team in the Pac-12 without a conference win. Oregon State has lost four straight. \nThe Beavers were expected to struggle this season as Andersen installs his new system. Oregon State was picked in the league's preseason media poll to finish last in the Pac-12 North, while Colorado was picked to finish at the bottom of the South. \nThe Beavers shook things up a bit, starting redshirt freshman Nick Mitchell at quarterback, handing off to usual starter Seth Collins on the team's first offensive play. Collins re-took the reins on the next play, but the two rotated throughout the game. \nMitchell was the Beavers' third-string quarterback, behind Collins and Marcus McMaryion, at the start of the season. But he has impressed the coaches in practice and this week he moved up the depth chart. \nOn the Beavers' opening drive, true freshman Collins also completed an 11-yard pass to Mitchell before Nall's 1-yard scoring run put Oregon State up 7-3. \nAndersen was emphatic that there is no quarterback controversy. The Beavers will play both young quarterbacks going forward. \nRedshirt freshman Nall a bright spot for the Beavers with his career-high yards rushing. \n\"I felt I did what I could out there,\" Nall said. \"Obviously it wasn't a perfect game.\" \nIt was especially tough injury-wise. \nBeavers starting cornerback Treston Decoud was injured when he was inadvertently hit by a teammate early in the second quarter and had to be taken from the field by ambulance. He was taken to a local hospital and Oregon State reported he was moving his extremities. \nHe returned to the team's locker room following the game, Andersen said. \nIn the second half, Oregon State was hurt again with the loss of starting left tackle Sean Harlow, who was carted off the field with an apparent injury to his right lower leg. \nReceiver Nelson Spruce pulled down a 15-yard scoring pass from Liufau to give the Buffaloes a 10-7 lead before Oregon State's Garrett Owens kicked a 42-yard field goal to tie it at 10. \nBoth teams missed field goals in the third quarter, and Liufau's 4-yard scoring run gave the Buffaloes the lead with 12:31 left in the game. The Beavers narrowed it with Garrett's 34-yard field goal, but couldn't get closer. \nMitchell completed 9 of 24 passes for 122 yards for the Beavers, while Collins was 4 of 7 for 77 yards, and ran for 50 more yards. \nMitchell was intercepted to end Oregon State's final drive of the game. \n\"There at the end of the game, I've got to make those throws to help our team out,\" he said. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:44:23.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
