I saw him ripping his tie off and throwing it on the floor in anger. \n\"He takes it all very personally and has an air of arrogance. He's not one for inviting you into his office for a drink after the game. \n\"The more I wound him up, the more I liked it. He tried to influence refs through the media and create a perception that we were bullies committing all the fouls, while his team just wanted to play. \n\"It seemed he wanted a rule where they should be allowed to do what they wanted with the ball, without us being allowed to tackle them. \n\"It was a skill finding their weaknesses and how to exploit them. But when we succeeded the press were usually on about Arsenal having an off-day and the ref being soft.\" \nAllardyce also takes a dig at Rafa Benitez, formerly of Liverpool and now at Real Madrid, saying the Spaniard deserves no credit for winning the Champions League with the Merseyside club in 2005. \n\"Of course he (Benitez) can say he won the Champions League with Liverpool, which is something I never did. But it was nowt to do with him. \n\"Steven Gerrard took that final by the scruff of the neck and dragged Liverpool back from 3-0 down against AC Milan to eventually win on penalties,\" Allardyce said. \n\"I don't blame Benitez for claiming credit -- but as managers we know the truth. \n\"It's like when you make a substitution in desperation and it comes off. You get all the credit for your tactical brilliance when it's often just luck.\" \n(Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty ) \nOur top photos from the past 24 hours.
