The first 19 came with the Blackhawks the previous two seasons.\n\"It’s a funny thing,\" Raanta said. \"I remember the last couple of years in Chicago, we were always great playing the home games. I don’t know if I feel any different but, of course, the stats are there. I don’t want to talk too much about it and jinx it.\"\nRaanta also became just the second Finnish goalie to play for the Rangers after Jussi Markkanen in 2003-04.\nAccording to plan \nCoach Alain Vigneault said he did not consider inserting Henrik Lundqvist to try and stem a three-game losing streak.\n\"It’s been good for me to see a lot of action early on,\" said Lundqvist, the Rangers’ best player with a 3-2-1 record and 2.16 GAA. \"I wanted to get into a nice flow and I appreciate that. At the same time, Antti needs to play. We need to get two guys going.\"\nBriefs \nLeft wing Viktor Stalberg notched his first goal as a Ranger to make it 4-0 at 16:44 of the third period. … The game marked the first time in team history the Rangers had Swedes (Stalberg, Jesper Fast, Oscar Lindberg), a Finnish player and a Norwegian (Mats Zuccarello) in their lineup. … Forwards Emerson Etem and Tanner Glass and defenseman Dylan McIlrath remained the healthy scratches.\n— Andrew Gross", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:46:48.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
