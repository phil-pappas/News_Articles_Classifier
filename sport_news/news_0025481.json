The Cardinals had just manhandled one of their two city rivals, Nashua High School North, in a key Division I West Conference game, by a whopping 40 points. But after hearing the words of their embattled coach, Jeff Moore, they all moved into a tight circle and didn't shout \"Cardinals!\" or \"Team!\" or one of those typical mottos. \"Coach Moore!\" they bellowed before heading to the locker room to change and leave. So there you go, a football team came together and fully supported its head coach, who was the center of a regional storm last week. For the last 20 years, Moore had worked as a Lowell (Mass.) police officer - mainly in 1-9 a.m. overnight shift. Just over a week ago, a citizen spotted him asleep with a pillow in his cruiser and popped a cell phone photo that was sent out to the media. A week later Moore resigned. Now, the burning question is, should his other employers, Bishop Guertin, demand he do the same? The answer here is no. Many will say yes, he should go. Many will say he should stay. According to Guertin officials, he will stay as their football coach, both now and in the future. Good. \"At this point, all I want is to talk about football,\" Moore said on Friday night. \"I'm glad they did, but I just want to talk about football.\" Some feel Moore set a bad example for his players, and they're right. But should he lose one job for a sin committed at the other? No. He broke the rules, but he didn't break any laws or what you might consider strict moral codes. Yet certainly there are higher standards for both of his jobs. Guertin officials felt Moore owned up to his mistake. They felt he handled things in the proper way, and that undoubtedly earned him some points. They like Moore. They hired him because they feel he's a good coach, not because he was a cop. They feel he can restore the program's numbers, which had severely dwindled since the Tony Johnson days. Johnson, the longtime coach who was forced to give up his sideline duties to focus solely on his duties as athletic director five years ago - thanks to, sources then maintained, a parental complaint - probably wishes he received the same support. Also, BG has been down this law enforcement road before, with different circumstances and results. Two decades ago, very popular Cardinals head boys basketball coach Dan Roche, a New Hampshire state trooper, lost his trooper job stemming from a couple of incidents on a bus trip to a Patriots game. Roche appealed (his lawyer at the time was current Nashua mayoral candidate James Donchess), and all the facts/documents were made public. BG officials felt the public revelations put coach and school in a bad light and Roche lost that job too. It was a tough call, but yours truly had wished BG had stood by its coach back then. Twenty years later, Guertin officials obviously had to decide the public gravity of Moore's issue. They came to the conclusion it did not hinder his ability to coach. The debate is interesting. Say Moore was a computer programmer and was found asleep at his desk and terminated. Would he be in danger of losing his BG coaching job? Of course not. The difference some may point to is that Moore was entrusted with public safety, a job in the public limelight, etc. Media reports say Moore has done this before, when he coached at Dracut, Mass., but privately BG officials will tell you they dispute some of that history. You'd have to wonder, if he had been found doing this in the past, why didn't the Lowell PD simply change his shift? But that's their issue. But the bottom line is, while not setting a good example for his players at first, Moore saved his coaching job by doing it later. He apparently came clean at BG, admitting his mistake. Remember, he broke a rule at one job, not the other. Were the BG players afraid their coach would be history? \"A little bit. We didn't know all the details for awhile,\" BG running back Jackson Housman said. \"We were kind of confused about what was going on. I don't think we were worried, but we were definitely feeling for him.\" Obviously, Moore will be on a short leash. But the other night, BG principal Jason Strniste and athletic director Pete Paladino didn't just tout policy, etc., as an excuse to keep their coach. They basically said they love the job Moore, whose up-tempo Cardinals are 5-2 atop the West Conference, is doing. \"It was tough. We had his back, though,\" Housman said. \"It was tough for him, but we came out and played for him.\" \"Yeah they did, they played hard for us,\" Moore said. It was obviously a tough week for the players. \"Yes,\" Moore said. \"For all of us. They got my back. We got their back. They got my back. So it's cool.\" It's cool that this time Bishop Guertin did the right thing. Tom King can be reached at 594-6468, tking@nashuatelegraph.com or @Telegraph_TomK.
