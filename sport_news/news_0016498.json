Norwich Free Academy informed him on Thursday that it, too, was going to stay with the Eastern Connecticut Conference in football in 2016. That followed on the heels of East Lyme, Fitch, Ledyard and New London all telling the ECC that they planned to stay with the league on Wednesday. “This was not a shot in the dark,” Carbone said. “We’ve been talking for a long time, there were a couple of good proposals, but you can’t blame anybody. There were allegiances and different perspectives, and in the end, maybe we didn’t ask ourselves if this worked for everybody.” Carbone added that had all five schools been on the same page last week, it would have been a done deal last Friday. Many of the SCC athletic directors didn’t feel that all five ECC schools were committed to the arrangement. NFA athletic director Eric Swallow said part of the problem was that the SCC favored a three-division, eight-team alignment. The five ECC schools favored the four-division, six-team approach. “There was some angst among the ECC (members) and all of them bowed out,” Swallow said. “We decided we didn’t want to make the jump and it probably would be best to be a little more patient.” The biggest problem for NFA, according to Swallow, was the potential loss of regional games. Had the Wildcats made the jump by themselves — something Carbone had indicated the SCC was amenable to because it would bring the conference to 20 schools — NFA would have received a nine-game schedule from the SCC. That would mean NFA could still play New London on Thanksgiving Day, but could not play East Lyme, Fitch and Ledyard on a regular basis. Carbone said, had NFA inquired, it was possible that the SCC may have reduced that to an eight-game league schedule. “We’re still loyal to the ECC. We didn’t want to end long-standing relationships,” Swallow said. It doesn’t mean the difficulties within the ECC are over. The league, according to a press release issued by chairman and Stonington athletic director Bryan Morrone, will be split into three divisions in 2016. East Lyme, Fitch, Ledyard, NFA and New London will occupy Division I. Division II will consist of Bacon Academy, Montville, Stonington and Waterford. Division III will have Griswold, Killingly, Plainfield and Windham. The league is only guaranteeing the Large Division six games because teams from Division III will not be scheduled to play teams from Division I. Division II teams will have eight or nine league-scheduled games and Division III teams will have six or seven. Page 2 of 2 - That breakdown is unlikely to change since it was approved by the league’s principals. However, it does not mean Division III teams can’t, on their own volition, schedule Division I teams. “I’m an optimist. I don’t think (the SCC-ECC merger) is dead. It’s a good thing to have these discussions,” Carbone said. “I like these guys. I thought it would work because we had the same beliefs: competitive games, a full schedule. It may pop up again in the future.” Carbone said he will continue to pursue it because his league needs an even number of teams. Right now, it stands at 19 and, like the ECC, there are competitive balance issues. The only way to solve that, Carbone believes, is to put together something that has been discussed in theory, but not put to the test — a district model approach. That’s where leagues become a thing of the past and the state is broken down into different, like-sized school divisions. Massachusetts and Rhode Island already follow that philosophy and Carbone said it only makes sense to do so here. “Ultimately, programs are judged by what they do at the state level,” Carbone said. “Leagues like the (Central Connecticut Conference, Naugatuck Valley and South West Conference) have to look beyond their boundaries. There are no such things as leagues anymore. That’s why they have increased the number of teams in the state playoffs. We haven’t discussed balanced schedules. Everybody tells us that we play a meat grinder of a schedule (in the SCC). Our teams play each other out of the playoffs. We have to talk about what is good for the sport.” By Marc Allard The Bulletin The Bulletin By Marc Allard The Bulletin Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 8:27 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:54:47.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
