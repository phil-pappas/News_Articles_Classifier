Comment Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 6:33 PM Seven points for the Patriots and the Colts. Here are seven things to keep in mind when the 4-0 Patriots play the 3-2 Indianapolis Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium on Sunday night: Deflate hate – Countless NFL teams dislike each other. Make no mistake about it: With these two teams the level of dislike has been passed and reached the point of unequivocal hatred. The Colts view the Patriots as cheaters who schemed to put underinflated footballs in play in last season’s AFC Championship Game. The Patriots, on the other hand, believe the Colts are whiners who can’t beat them and that the charges filed against them in the wake of Deflategate are nothing but hot air. Hoosier daddies – For all the talk that this is a heated rivalry, is it? By definition, heated rivalries have to be competitive and, fact is, this one hasn’t been for years. The Patriots have clearly had the upper hand on the Colts, winning the past six times they’ve met, the most recent being their 45-7 romp in that 2014 AFC Championship Game at Gillette Stadium nine months ago tomorrow. Since his arrival as the top pick in the 2012 draft, Andrew Luck (officially listed as questionable for the game with a right shoulder injury, but expectations are that he’ll play) has quarterbacked Colts teams that have lost by 35, 21, 22 and 38 points to the Patriots. Luck’s passing percentage in those four games is 50.3, his passer rating isn’t much better (58.7) and his interceptions outnumber his touchdown passes, 10-6. In contrast to that, Tom Brady has posted a passer rating of 95.2 or better in six of his last eight games against the Colts. The Indianapolis .500 – For all the preseason talk that this would be the year they would step up to the next level and represent the AFC in the Super Bowl, the Colts haven’t exactly come charging out of the gate. The Colts have followed two consecutive double-digit losses to start the season with three wins by a combined 12 points within the NFL’s jayvee division (the AFC South), but with a losson Sunday night they’ll be mired at .500 six games into their regular season. Not exactly the pedigree of a Super Bowl contender. Luck’s fourth season in the league has been a microcosm of the Colts’– his interceptions outnumber his TD passes, 7-5, and his passer rating was at 65.1 before he sat out the past two games with the shoulder injury and watched 40-year-old Matt Hasselbeck lead the Colts to victories over Jacksonville and Houston. Page 2 of 2 - What’s my line? – With left tackle Nate Solder’s placement on the injured reserve list (with a torn right biceps) on Wednesday, the Patriots’ offensive line has taken a blindside hit. The team could simply insert Marcus Cannon at left tackle, as it did when Solder was injured in the first half of its 30-6 win at Dallas last Sunday, or it could flip right tackle Sebastian Vollmer over to the left side and plug Cannon in at Vollmer’s customary spot. The team also has an injury issue on the defensive side of the ball with cornerback Tarell Brown (foot) ruled out. Getting carried away – The Patriots have run up some gaudy numbers (130 carries for 675 yards and 13 touchdowns) on the ground the past three times these teams have met. LeGarrette Blount (24 carries for 166 yards and a franchise-record four rushing touchdowns in the Patriots’ 43-22 divisional playoff win in January of 2014), the since-departed Jonas Gray (37-201-4 in the teams’ regular-season game last November) and Blount again (30-148-3 in last season’s AFC title game) have alternated the bulk of the workloads over that time. The Colts’ rush defense has been run of the mill this year, 19th in the league, allowing 112.0 yards per game. What’s the rush? – If the Colts couldn’t generate much of a pass rush against Houston’s dreadful duo – Ryan Mallett and Brian Hoyer – there’s no reason to think they’ll do it against a quarterback like Brady, who actually understands what he’s looking at in a defense, makes the proper decisions and gets the ball out quickly. The Colts had just one sack (for no yards) in their most recent outing, their 27-20 win over the Texans in a game Mallett and Hoyer combined to complete 31 passes in 41 attempts for 362 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions (by safety Mike Adams). The Colts have registered just six sacks this season against opponents who’ve thrown the ball 188 times against them, compiling a collective passer rating of 98.8 in the process. Turnover time – Turnovers have been a tale of two teams. At minus-7 (five takeaways, 12 giveaways), the Colts rank 31st in the league (only the Texans, at minus-8, are worse). At plus-5, (seven takeaways, two giveaways), the Patriots are tied for fifth. Glen Farley may be reached at gfarley@enterprisenews.com.
