You wouldn’t have expected anything less. Not in this game against the Indianapolis Colts. This was the matchup many Patriots fans had been waiting so long for. The game when the Patriots were supposed to exact revenge for an offseason full of Deflategate controversy. Early on, the Colts played as if they were the ones who had been offended. But as has happened in the previous four matchups between these teams, the second half was a whole other ball game. And as has happened through four games this season, Brady took his performance to another level. Brady’s tour of retribution continued Sunday night. In front a fan base that ridiculed him and purchased deflated football hats outside the stadium, Brady continued to take out his frustration on opposing secondaries and led the Patriots to a 34-27 win over the Colts. Brady finished 23-of-37 passing for 312 yards and three touchdowns. Through five games, he has the second-most passing yards and passing touchdowns in his career. “He did great,” said Rob Gronkowski. “A lot of physical toughness, a lot of mental toughness. We just went out as a team and performed very well.” In the two teams’ previous four meetings, the Patriots vigorously beat the Colts, Indianapolis leading for a total time of only 8:26 in those contests. Another theme was the way the Patriots stepped on the gas pedal in the final two quarters, outscoring the Colts by a total of 113-27 in the second half of those four games. The Colts did all they could on Sunday to stanch the bleeding. There were five lead changes in the first half as Indianapolis scored an early touchdown and traded punches with the Patriots through halftime. But once again, the second half was a different story. Indianapolis opened the game with a 13-play, 89-yard drive, which ended in a 5-yard touchdown pass from Andrew Luck to Donte Moncrief. Brady and the Patriots offense responded quickly. The group traveled 80 yards in 4:26 to tie the game, 7-7, on a Julian Edelman 12-yard touchdown. The Patriots defense settled down the next time on the field, holding the Colts to a three-and-out. The Patriots responded by taking a 10-7 lead thanks to a 40-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski early in the second quarter. The Colts defense then made a big play. Edelman bobbled a Brady pass and safety Mike Adams intercepted it, returning the ball 14 yards for a touchdown, to give Indianapolis a 14-10 lead. It was Brady’s first interception of the season. “I let TB down,” said Edelman, who appeared to have dislocated a finger on his right hand earlier in the game. “That interception should be on me.” Page 2 of 3 - Colts coach Chuck Pagano then ordered a surprise onside kick on the ensuing kickoff. Although Moncrief eventually emerged from the pile with the ball, the officials first ruled that the Patriots had recovered, and did not find enough visual evidence to overturn the call on replay. The Pats retook the lead thanks to LeGarrette Blount’s 38-yard touchdown run. The Patriots’ 17-14 lead didn’t last long. Luck answered right away, orchestrating a 12-play, 80-yard touchdown drive on the next series, hitting T.Y. Hilton for a 3-yard touchdown with 2:38 left in the first half. It looked like the Patriots would go into halftime with a lead, but Scott Chandler’s touchdown was called back when the tight end was flagged for offensive pass interference. The Patriots settled for a 35-yard Gostkowski field goal and the Colts went into halftime with a 21-20 lead. Indianapolis’ lead wouldn’t last much longer. The Patriots opened the second half with a quick 80-yard touchdown drive as Brady hit Rob Gronkowski for a 25-yard touchdown to take a 27-21 lead. Then, later in the third, the Colts ran the strangest fake punt play imaginable. Their entire team was lined up on the right side of the field with safety Colt Anderson lined up under wide receiver Griff Whalen, who was in the center spot. Whalen snapped to Anderson, who was swarmed by Brandon Bolden. The formation was illegal, but coach Bill Belichick declined the penalty and the Patriots took over 35 yards away from the end zone late in the third quarter. “We didn’t know how we wanted to handle it, but at the end we just figured, ‘Hey, if they have one guy to snap the ball and there are three of us over it and we just tackle him before he throws it, then you can’t really get a play off,’” said Logan Ryan, who was on the field for the play. “We just went for it and we were able to make a play.” “The whole idea there was on fourth-and-3 or less, shift our alignment to where you either catch them misaligned, they try to sub some people in, catch them with 12 men on the field and if you get a certain look, you can make a play,” Pagano said. “Alignment-wise we weren’t lined up correctly, and then a communication problem on the snap. I take responsibility for that.” The boned-headed play resulted in another Patriots touchdown, this time from Brady to Blount at 12:56 to give the Pats held a 34-21 lead. After the play, chants of “Brady! Brady! Brady!” briefly filled the stadium, before the boos began to rain in.
