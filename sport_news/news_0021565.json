Now 4-4, on a four-game losing streak, IU has time to figure out just how it has squandered a 4-0 start, a 25-point lead and a chance to take the lead against two top-10 programs in the fourth quarter.\nIU needs to visualize whatever steps it will take to get over the hump, because with Iowa (7-0, 3-0) and Michigan (5-2, 2-1) ahead, that barrier isn’t going to get any smaller.\nThere was one more missed opportunity Saturday that was out of IU’s control.\nAfter Michigan State scored its first touchdown, a deluge opened up on the IU offense. Sudfeld said it was unlike any weather he’s played in before, comparable to taking a shower in football pads.\n“It was like trying to catch a bar of soap,” he said.\nRight now, IU is in the midst of a deluge. Opportunity is that bar of soap.\nAnd somehow, the Hoosiers need to find a way to take hold.\nvziege@indiana.edu", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:10:13.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
