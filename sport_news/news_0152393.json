Optimism for UAlbany men's basketball as practice begins 1 / 6 Back to Gallery \nAlbany \nOf course, there should be optimism at SEFCU Arena on Thursday, the day the UAlbany men's basketball team begins practice. \nThe Danes are the three-time defending America East Tournament champions, and they have three straight trips to the NCAA Tournament to prove it. \nThere is no doubt in coach Will Brown 's mind that the Danes can make another deep run through the America East. \n\"Can we win the regular season? Absolutely,\" Brown said. \"We will have as good an opportunity as any team in the league to win the conference tournament.\" \nIt's October, and just about every coach in the country is saying the same thing. Brown isn't boasting; he's being honest. UAlbany, which has been very good the past three years, should be good again. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information. \nThe Danes return most of the heart of last year's team that went 24-9 overall and ripped through the America East season, going 15-1. When Brown greets the Danes at SEFCU at 3 p.m. Thursday, he'll see familiar faces like fifth-year senior guard Peter Hooley (13.7 points per game and the two-time defending America East Conference Tournament MVP) as well as seniors Evan Singletary (13.0 ppg) and Ray Sanders (9.7 ppg, 4.6 rebounds per game). \nThose three will give the Danes the best perimeter game in the league. What the Danes have to work on is the inside game. \nSeven players are gone from last year's team, and the biggest loss is easily that of the graduated 6-foot-5 Sam Rowley, who left as the program's Division I all-time leader in rebounds (756); he also scored 1,194 career points. As good as the returning players are — and as good as Brown thinks newcomers like freshman guard Joe Cremo (6-4, 190-pounds) from Scotia and junior college transfers Chas Brown (6-8, 220-pounds) and Travis Charles (6-6, 235 pounds) can be — Brown can't stress enough how much the Danes are going to miss Rowley's crafty inside presence. \n\"When people like to tell me how good we are going to be or they like to tell me we are going to win four (championships) in a row, I chuckle inside,\" Brown said. \"People have no idea how big a loss Sam is. We ran everything through him.\" \nBrown can't expect to have a Rowley lurking somewhere in his 14-man roster. But he thinks he has the answer to replacing Rowley. It might just take three or four players to do it. \nThe inside holders include 6-11, 280-pound junior Richard Peters ; 6-8, 230-pound junior Mike Rowley (Sam's brother) and 6-7, 240-pound sophomore Greig Stire of CBA, who has added 15 pounds for his second season. \nBrown is confident the trio will defend and rebound. What they have to do is score. Last year, they combined to average 8.1 points per game. But, with Sam Rowley around, they didn't have to put the ball in the basket. \nThis winter, someone will. \n\"All three of them are better,\" Brown said, \"but it has to show in production.\" \nBrown has had success with junior-college transfers in the past — Singletary and Sanders came from that route last year — and he is hoping he has more luck this year. From what he has seen in offseason workouts, Charles can \"really score\" and Brown is the best athlete on the roster, the coach says. \n\"A lot of people, including the head coach, will question this team,\" Brown says. \"They should expect the challenge, embrace it and meet it head on. Practice will really show me a lot.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:57:58.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
