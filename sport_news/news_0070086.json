The organization has been delivering Bags of Hope to let women know that they have support and cheerleaders behind them.\n“The organization does most of its work through education and raising awareness throughout the state,” said GOCA Executive Director Doug Barron. “Bags of Hope is our way to reach out to the women and families to help them get through a difficult time.”\nVolunteers got together on Sept. 26 to pack Bags of Hope for patients across Georgia. This particular packing day brought together ovarian cancer survivors who packed 100 bags for new patients.\nGeorgia Ovarian Cancer Alliance Executive Director Doug Barron and volunteer Donna Grossman proudly showcase the Bags of Hope that will be distributed to newly diagnosed cancer patients throughout Georgia.

Not only do the bags provide practical assistance while undergoing treatment, but they let patients know they are not alone on their journey.\n“It was a great way to give back to new patients and spread some hope as these women and their families go through a tough time,” said Kimberly Emory, who was diagnosed in 2006.\nThe community can give back by volunteering with Bags of Hope and sponsor a packing event. Since its founding, GOCA has distributed over 1,800 bags around Georgia.\nEducation and awareness about ovarian cancer is integral to survivorship because there is no test to detect the cancer. One in 55 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. However if caught in its earliest stages, the five-year survival rate is over 90 percent.\nGOCA offers various programs such as Survivors Teaching Students – Saving Women’s Lives and GOCA’s Awareness.Knowledge.Action campaign which spreads awareness and education throughout the community.\n“The more people can be aware of ovarian cancer and its symptoms, the more lives we can save,” said Barron.\nIn other news: the Greater Atlanta Credit Union Chapter held its 12th Bowl-a-Thon fundraiser for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals on Aug. 29 at Bowlmor Atlanta. The event raised $54,000 to support the Family Support Services Department at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.\nWho’s doing good?Each Tuesday, we write about charity events such as fun-runs, volunteer projects and other community gatherings that benefit a good cause.
