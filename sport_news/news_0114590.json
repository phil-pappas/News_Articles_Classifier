(AP) - A Louisiana-based dredging company has been charged in the boating death of Biloxi businessman.\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office filed the charge Friday against C.F. Bean LLC, of Belle Chasse.\nThe Sun Herald reports ( http://bit.ly/1PCkjxN ) Bean faces a charge of misconduct or neglect of ship officers resulting in the Sept. 16, 2012 death of Mark Barhanovich.\nBarhanovich, 54, died after an accident near the eastern tip of Deer Island. His 23-foot fishing vessel struck an object that caused the outboard motor to break free from the stern. Previous reports show the motor flipped into the boat and its propeller struck him in the back.\nThe Mississippi State Port Authority had awarded Bean a contract for dredging operations in the area but, according to the charging document, Bean failed to properly mark and light a floating dredge pipeline running 3,800 feet from the east end of Deer Island to a dredge barge named Bean 20.\nThe company is accused of \"negligence, neglect, violation of law and inattention to duties\" resulting in Barhanovich's death.\nAccording to the bill of information, federal law required the company to put lights and shapes on its barge as a warning to boaters.\nThe accident occurred about 6:20 a.m. No details have been released on weather conditions.\nThe pipeline stretched between Deer Island and the barge in a popular path for recreational boaters from Biloxi's Back Bay and the Ocean Springs Harbor.\nInformation from: The Sun Herald, http://www.sunherald.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
