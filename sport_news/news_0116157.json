The College GameDay set will be at Independence Mall. \nThe news came as a blow for WSU fans hoping College GameDay would visit the campus for the first time in the show's history. \nSince 2003, The Ol' Crimson Booster Club has waved a WSU flag at 171 College GameDay shows, with the notion the crew would eventual visit the Palouse. \nESPN delayed the announcement a day to get the necessary permits to set at Independence Mall, according to philly.com . After the news broke, College GameDay senior coordinating producer Lee Fitting tweeted that it was the \"toughest College Gameday call during his tenure.\" \n\"Looking forward to (Temple football) this (weekend),\" he added. \"(WSU), we'll get there one day, I promise.\" \nRegardless, the Cougars' matchup with the Cardinal is the biggest since coach Mike Leach took over after the 2011 season. At 5-2 (3-1 Pac-12), a WSU win would give the Cougars the tiebreaker over Stanford (6-1, 5-0 Pac-12) in the Pac-12 North. \nKickoff is set 7:30 p.m. Pacific Time. It will be aired on ESPN. \nLuke Falk earns another award \nWSU quarterback Luke Falk on Monday was named Pac-12 offensive player of the week after going 47-for-62 for 514 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions in the Cougars' 45-42 road win over Arizona. \nIt marks the second time this season Falk has earned the award. \nIn 2015, Falk, a third-year sophomore, has thrown for 2,885 yards, 26 touchdowns and four interceptions. \nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle sports news .
