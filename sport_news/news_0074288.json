(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Gene J. Puskar / AP) Maryland will face another standout defensive lineman in Penn State's Carl Nassib. \nThe Maryland offensive line worked all offseason for this stretch of Big Ten Conference games. \nThey worked to bulk up to be able to contend with some of the nation's top defensive linemen, such as Ohio State's Joey Bosa and Adolphus Washington, and Michigan's Chris Wormley and Willie Henry, like they did earlier this month. \nAnd now, for their latest test in the trenches, the Terps will face the nation's leader in sacks, tackles for loss and forced fumbles — Penn State defensive end Carl Nassib, who anchors a Nittany Lions defense that ranks 16th nationally in total defense. \n\"We love it,\" right guard Andrew Zeller said. \"We embrace the challenge, especially as an offensive line. Getting the opportunity to go against the bigger defensive linemen, we love it. We love going out and being able to compete with them.\" \nNassib, a former walk-on, has 11 1/2 sacks, 15 1/2 tackles for loss and five forced fumbles in a season in which he's been a force. The Nittany Lions have started the same front four in their first seven games this season — Nassib and Garrett Sickels at the ends, Anthony Zettel and Austin Johnson in the interior — and they've caused problems for opposing defenses, especially with Nassib's nose for the football.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:06:44.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
