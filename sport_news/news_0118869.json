(Photo: AP) Galle : West Indies were struggling to avoid an innings defeat on Friday as they ended day three of the first Test against Sri Lanka on 67-2 in their second innings, still needing another 166 to force their hosts to bat again.\nForced to follow on after making 251 the first time round, West Indies face a mammoth task to save the match at the Galle International Stadium with two days still left to play.\nAfter taking six for 68 in the West Indies' first innings, veteran spinner Rangana Herath then claimed the wicket of opener Kraigg Brathwaite, who fell for 34 as play drew to a close, for the second time in the match.\nBraithwaite's was the second wicket to fall in the tourists' second innings, following the dismissal of Shai Hope.\nThe 21-year-old Hope made only six before he became the debutant Milinda Siriwardana's first victim in Test cricket, dragging the ball onto his stumps as he tried a back-foot pull.\nDarren Bravo was unbeaten on 20 at stumps, batting alongside the nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo who has made six.\nSri Lanka earlier compiled a formidable first innings total of 484, thanks mainly to big centuries from Dinesh Chandimal (151) and Dimuth Karunaratne (186).\nBravo and Jerome Taylor were the only batsman to offer significant resistance in the West Indies' first innings.\nBravo batted confidently to make the highest score of 50 and was dismissed to a sharp catch by Chandimal off Herath just before lunch.\n Cricket Sri Lanka vs West Indies Kraigg Brathwaite Rangana Herath Dinesh Chandimal Also Read Former Aussie quick Merv Hughes supports bouncers Steve Smith loses no.1 test ranking Former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu ‘is making steady recovery’ Watch: Why Rubel Hossain sledged Virat Kohli?", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Kraigg.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Kraigg.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151016/sports-cricket/article/sri-lanka’s-ball-galle-wi-struggle-avoid-innings-defeat", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:33:22.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
