After the game they only accumulated three wins and 33 points. With only two games to play and they were 17 points away from safety, their fate was sealed. \nWhile TPLBC go down, there are now at least five clubs engaged in the relegation dogfight. Positioned at fifth, Hong Kong Football Club has 60 points but played at least one match more than the rest. Bottom of the queue is the Police team who only has 49 points but has two games in hand. \nAfter dispatching Taipo, KCC moved up to second with just five points less than the leader and defending champion Kowloon Bowling Green Club. Craigengower Cricket Club is in third place with eight points less but has a game in hand. \nIn addition to the regular fixture against Tuen Mun Sports Association this Saturday, KBGC will visit CCC this Sunday to play a match postponed from October 3. This match is considered a champion-decider as the results will have a direct impact on the championship. \nIn Division 2, Hong Kong Cricket Club is leading the table by nine points and is looking set to return to the top flight after an absence of almost 20 years. They are closely chased by Indian Recreation Club, Hong Kong Football Club, Hong Kong Youth Team and City Lawn Bowls Club. \nWomen In the women’s section, Hong Kong Football Club A team will need to wait until this week to confirm their ninth successive title as they were defeated 6-2 by third-placed Seabird Sports Club last weekend. \nAlthough HKFC’s leading edge was cut to two points, they still have a game in hand. Should all the results this weekend go their way, they will be celebrating at Saturday evening. \nIn the bottom half, the relegation fight is now between United Service Recreation Club, Kowloon Cricket Club and Craigengower Cricket Club, who are only separated by five points. \nClaudius Lam is an officer of the Hong Kong Lawn Bowls Association", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:18:23.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
