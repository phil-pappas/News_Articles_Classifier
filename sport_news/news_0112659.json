He helped turn a losing team into a winner, ran and passed for more than 8,000 yards and set a few records along the way. But mostly what he’ll be remembered for are injuries and what might have been.\nChuckie Keeton had a star-crossed career.\nOh, wait, did you think we were talking about Taysom Hill? Everyone is eulogizing Hill’s career. There’s not nearly as much talk about Keeton, who was actually a better quarterback than his more acclaimed instate rival and had an equally ill-fated career that was punctuated by frequent starts and stops.\nThe collegiate careers of Hill and Keeton are remarkably similar. Both became starters as freshmen. Both managed to stay on the field for an entire season only once — both during their sophomore seasons. Both played only six games in 2014 and 2015 combined, although Keeton could possibly return in a few weeks to try again if his balky knee recovers sufficiently. Remarkably, they missed all or part of seven seasons combined.\nHill suffered season-ending injuries in 2012 (knee), 2014 (ankle) and 2015 (foot), missing 25 games (projecting through the end of the current season). Keeton suffered season-ending injuries in 2011 (neck), 2013 (knee), 2014 (knee) and possibly 2015 (knee), although after being injured in the third game it was announced that he could return to the field in 4-6 weeks. He has missed 23 games and counting.\nBoth are athletic quarterbacks, with Hill the better runner and Keeton the better passer. Playing for a bigger, more established football school, Hill has received more hype, some of it frankly overblown when you take an objective look at his body of work, while Keeton tends to get less credit than he earned.\nHill is undoubtedly an athletic specimen, a combination of speed and size that would seem ideal for an NFL safety, if he could stay healthy. But when it comes to his legacy as a quarterback, any evaluation of his performance is limited. Most of his playing time — 19 games, in fact — occurred when he was a freshman and sophomore and still a raw, developing talent. By the end of the season, he will have played in less than half of BYU ’s games (25 of 52).\nHill’s career pass efficiency rating is a mere 123.9. But he played in only 25 games, you say. PE ratings are like batting averages — the more games you play, the more difficult it is to maintain a high rating, and still Hill’s rating is low. Lower than the PE ratings for Max Hall (150.1), John Beck (141.3), Brandon Doman (152.0), Kevin Feterik (138.9), Steve Sarkisian (161.9), John Walsh (147.6), Ty Detmer (162.7), Sean Covey (130.1), Steve Lindsley (129.8), Robbie Bosco (149.4), Steve Young (149.9), Jim McMahon (156.9), Gifford Nielsen (145.2) and Gary Sheide (138.8). Unlike Hill, those quarterbacks had the advantage of playing extensively as experienced, seasoned players — as juniors and seniors.\nIf you don’t understand the PE rating — which is understandable given its complexity — then here are the key numbers: Yards per pass attempt and touchdown passes to interceptions. Hill threw 31 touchdown passes and 20 interceptions and averaged only 6.8 yards per attempt.\nAs a passer, Hill, who had a 15-6 won-loss record as a starter, was still a work in progress. In his one full season of play he had a rating of 118.2.\nAs a runner, Hill had few peers. He is a faster version of Tim Tebow and it’s easy to imagine him as a running back. He averaged 5.6 yards per carry and totaled 2,212 yards and 24 touchdowns, an average of one touchdown every 16 carries — and all of these numbers include sacks and runs that began as pass plays. He collected 6,818 yards in total offense or 272 yards per game.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team100.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:53:53.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
