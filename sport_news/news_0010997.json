Consider how depleted Illinois is at the skill positions right now, and yet how close they came to beating an undefeated Iowa Squad: With 2 of their top 3 WR's and RB's out, Illinois beat Nebraska and hung with (22) Iowa on the road. (Dudek/Hardee/Brown/Ferguson out) \n— Illini Update (@IlliniUpdate) October 10, 2015 \nAt the bye week, Illini football is not 4-2, and that means they just need to go 2-4 down the stretch to go bowling again (no six win Big Ten team will ever be home for the holidays in this new era of bowl expansion, don’t be shocked if a five win team somehow goes as well). \nLikely wins: @Purdue Nov 7 \nLikely losses: Ohio St. Nov 14, @Penn St Oct. 31 \nCould go either way: Wisconsin October 24th, @ Minnesota Nov 21st, Northwestern @ Solider Field Nov 28th \nMy weekly Northwestern and Illini football segment on KOZN Omaha 1620 The Zone: \nYou should probably hear Ron Johnson’s segment talking smack about the state of Nebraska too. That’s what led to joke in the intro: \nSo which bowl is Illinois headed to? It’s still mid October but here’s what they’re saying. \nPalm, CBS : Quick Lane, Detroit, December 28th vs Pittsburgh \nBleacher Report: Armed Forces, Ft. Worth, December 29th vs UL-Lafayette \nSB Nation: Poinsettia, San Diego, December 28th vs Boston College \nMcMurphy, ESPN: Pinstripe, New York, December 26th vs Pittsburgh \nSchlabach, ESPN: Quick Lane, vs N.C. State \nOn a side note, let’s hope Bill Cubit never calls another play in which WR Geronimo Allison throws a pass. When I saw that, my thought was…. \nWe’ll be updating this every week, possibly adding more projections as they come in. So watch this space Illini football fans. \nIf you have bowl projection, and it’s not listed here, email and/or Tweet it to me @paulmbanks and thesportsbank DOT net AT gmail DOT com. \n  \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:19:43.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
