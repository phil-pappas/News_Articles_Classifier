Shows that Palmer is making good throws. Palmer makes the machine work. John Brown is good, don't get me wrong, but QB's make receivers in this league. It's no different than anyone Peyton Manning has thrown to, including Demerius Thomas, he wasn't even on the radar as a great receiver until Peyton started chucking it to him. TY Hilton wasn't on the radar either. Same with Reggie Wayne and Marvin Harrison. Talent, yes, HOF #'s before Manning, no. Palmer is playing at an exceptional level. His arm strength and decision-making seem the same to me, but he's excelled in his lower body. His footwork in the pocket is outstanding. I'd say it's better than he's ever played, regarding his feet, hips and body positioning. It's not just about moving up in the pocket, he's reforming the pocket by stepping side-wise and up and putting himself in position to make good throws. This is the best I've ever seen him play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:03:09.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
