They sort of liked that,” Ducat said. “They took the idea to heart.” \nAnd to the field. \nThe Ships have put up 37 and 35 points the past two games — after scoring just 38 through the first four contests — which is the fourth highest total among the league’s teams over that span. \n“Now we are putting up points just as well as anybody in the conference,” Ducat said. “We didn’t have a defensive identity and we didn’t really have an offensive identity. We were just stuck not knowing who we were.” \nDucat said the transformation to productive offense wasn’t that big of a change.

Joe Sienkiewicz / Gannett Wisconsin Media \nThe Ships started using more people on offense, went back to more roll-out pass plays instead of straight drop backs and got improved play on the offensive line. \n“(The line) is executing better at the end of the play. At the beginning of the season, they were getting to where they needed to be but then not executing,” Ducat said. “They have been giving Trevor (Feest) a good amount of time to throw the ball.” \nFeest has also been more productive over the past two weeks. \nThe senior quarterback has gone 27-of-52 for 382 yards without an interception the past two weeks and has played a role in nine of the team’s 10 touchdowns in that span — he has ran for four scores and thrown for five more. David LaTour has been Feest’s top receiver with 12 catches for 151 yards, while Logan Michalek has seven receptions for 125 yards. \n“He’s been very smart with the ball,” Feest said. Passing the ball, he’s been real sharp, and the other thing is that we are catching the ball. Early on, we were having six or seven drops per game.” \nAlthough productive on offense, the Ships weren’t able to produce a win in either of the last two weeks. They fell to Green Bay Southwest 62-37 and then lost a heart-breaker to Green Bay Notre Dame 36-35 last week. \nDucat is hoping that resurgence results in a victory. But not just any win. \n“We want to beat a team with a winning record,” Ducat said. “All of the teams we beat last year had losing records and we don’t want to continue to be a team that only beats teams (with losing records). We want to prove what kind of a team we have.” \nSkid ends here \nTwo area teams are assured of seeing losing streaks come to an end this week, while two others will see their slides continue. \nRoncalli and Two Rivers had each lost the last two contests — both losing to Eastern Wisconsin Conference co-leaders Sheboygan Falls and Kiel — and will matchup on Friday at Ron Rubick Field. \nTwo Rivers quarterback Dawson Kiphart has continued to be solid despite the past two losses, going 28-for-62 for 427 yards and four touchdowns. He did throw three interceptions in the loss to Kiel. \nRoncalli will counter with its talented backfield of running backs — Zach Jac quart, Cory Bahrs and Ryan Rank — who were limited to just 85 yards against Sheboygan Falls, but helped the team put up 207 yards on the ground against Sheboygan Falls. \nEither Reedsville or Mishicot will also see their losing streaks end as both teams enter the game winless on the season. \nThe Indians won last years’ meeting 21-20, while the Panthers collected the win when the two teams played in Reedsville in 2013. \nThree of Mishicot’s losses have been by seven points or less, including the last two weeks when they fell to St. Mary Catholic (14-8) and Howards Grove (15-12). \nThe Panthers scored 14 points in a 19-14 loss to Manitowoc Lutheran in the opener, but have since scored just 32 points in the last five games and were shut out twice. \nFive of a Kind \nIt’s one thing to make the WIAA playoffs on a consistent basis, but it’s another to post wins and advance. As we approach the postseason, I thought I would take a look at which of the area teams have played the most WIAA playoff games. Here they are in order: \n•1. Manitowoc Lincoln (37 games, 23 playoff appearances): The three straight state titles from 1984-86 help the Ships’ total, but Lincoln had 10 straight trips where it lost its playoff opener. \n•2. Valders (21 games, 12 playoff appearances): The Vikings have played more than one playoff game in half of their 12 postseason appearances. \n•3. Two Rivers (18 games, 12 playoff appearances): Like the Ships, the Raiders three straight titles in the 1980s boost their total slightly, but Two Rivers has played more than one postseason game just once since 1982. \n•4. Roncalli (15 games, 7 playoff appearances): The Jets are the only area team averaging more than two playoff games per appearance. \n•5. Manitowoc Lutheran (12 games, 8 playoff appearances): Four times the Lancers have advanced to Level 2, but have yet to crack the Level 3 playoff game plateau. \nTop 5 \nEach week I will rank what I feel are the top 5 teams in the area. These rankings are not based on head-to-head competition (No. 1 team would beat No. 2 team), rather it will be gauging how they would stack up against teams in their own division. With that said, here are the Week 7 rankings. \n•1. Kiel (6-0): Another big win last week for the Raiders, but they can’t afford a letdown in either of the next two weeks looking ahead to regular-season finale against Sheboygan Falls. \n•2. Roncalli (3-3): The Jets can solidify their playoff position with a win this week over Two Rivers. \n•3. Two Rivers (2-4): It’s hard to imagine playing every game on the road. The Raiders get points just for that. \n•4. Manitowoc Lincoln (1-5): The offense is definitely improved and the Ships came within a two-point conversion of beating Notre Dame last week. \n•5. Valders (3-3): Playoff hopes took a hit last week in the loss to New Holstein. \nSteve Clark: sclark@gannett.com or follow on Twitter at @skcreno27 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://htrne.ws/1FJDZ0H TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:07:05.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
