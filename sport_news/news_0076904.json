(PRWEB) October 20, 2015\nAre you ready for some football? With another season of America’s favorite sport well underway, fans are switching things up, ditching the typical parking lot tailgate and opting to host “homegating” events in their own backyards.\nAccording to the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association (HPBA), football games are the most popular tailgating events among grill owners.* But as the “homegating” trend continues to rise, more and more grill owners are taking a time-out from the typical tailgate scene and setting up the ultimate football headquarters right in their backyard, bringing the game-day atmosphere to the comfort of their own home.\n“The homegating trend gives football fans the best of both worlds. Fans can fire up their grill and cheer on their favorite team without even having to leave their home,” said Jack Goldman, President and CEO, HPBA. “Homegating also opens up endless options for grill owners as they’re no longer confined to stadium or venue tailgating restrictions and they don’t have to choose which grilling accessories to bring along and which to leave at home.”\nThe industry association is helping consumers get their game plan together with these tips for a winning homegating event:\n1. Draft a strong safety: You can’t win without a solid defense. Tackle common grilling errors and avoid a homegating penalty by brushing up on your barbecuing safety tips in your pre-game warmup.\n2. Equipment check: Don’t drop the ball on making sure your equipment is working properly before the party kicks off. Fuel up with charcoal, wood chips or a propane tank and brushing up on the safety guidelines for your grill.\n3. Pre-game prep: Prep and marinate meat before the crowd arrives. Mix dips, cut up fruit and chop veggies so everything is grill-ready for game time.\n4. Go the extra yard: Score big by offering to bring an extra grill to the party. There are plenty of easy portable options like a tailgate grill that attaches to your vehicle, a portable grill with a push-button ignitor, or a small smoker. You can even make pizzas on-the-go with an oven tailgater.\n5. Be a team player: Smoked or grilled meat may be the MVP at your homegate party, but to really win big, grill up sides, desserts or veggie kabobs using a grill stone to keep sauces and marinades from slipping through the grates, or use a pizza oven to whip up a few pies for an appetizer that everyone will love.\n6. Rally the team: Before the pros kick-off, rally your teammates for some backyard competition. Toss around a football or play a game of Cornhole – just make sure all activates take place a safe distance away from the grilling area.\n7. Complete the two-point conversion: Score the extra point for your party with the ultimate homegating patio accessories. Fire up the patio heater to keep your guests around post-game, or huddle around a fire pit to celebrate a big win with a cold beverage from your bar caddy.\n8. Trade in your quarterback: Just as every team relies on its quarterback, every homegate needs a solid grill. Consider upgrading to a new model or adding a new flame to the team with a smoker or charcoal grill.\nScore a touchdown during your homegating party with these fan favorite recipes from HPBA’s playbook.\nPlank-Grilled Potato Skins\nSource: Napoleon Grills\nServes 12-36\nPrep time: 1 hour 30 minutes\nGrill time: 20 minutes\nIngredients:\n 1 -2 cedar planks, soaked overnight 6 baking potatoes 1/4 cup olive oil 1/4 cup rib rub 1 cup barbecue sauce 8 slices bacon, diced, fried crisp and wrapped in paper towel 1/2 cup shredded old orange cheddar cheese 3-4 green onions, chopped\nDirections:\nBoil or bake potatoes until tender.
