Either that or find the game tapes and burn them in the Honda Center parking lot.\nThe excitement of his first start with the Ducks evaporated in a matter of minutes. Less than thirteen. The Coyotes torched the goaltender for three first-period goals, with exciting youngsters Anthony Duclair and Max Domi doing the honors.\nIt wasn’t supposed to go like this.\nHours before, Khudobin was eager to get his career going with his new team and was carrying into his first game some strong work during his three preseason looks. The numbers backed it up – a 2-0 record in two starts, 0.86 goals-against average and .970 save percentage.\n“Camp was good,” Khudobin said. “But it’s always camp. You’re preparing for the camp, first of all. You’re getting ready for the season and stuff like that. I just tried to show what I could do. It worked, and I think everybody was happy with it. Now it’s the real deal.”\nIt was all too real Wednesday, with his night done after eight shots. Duclair scored twice, while Domi used some impressive speed to create his teammate’s second goal and then score his own less than three minutes later.\nKhudobin is essentially taking the spot of John Gibson, whom the Ducks sent to their American Hockey League team in San Diego so he could play regularly since Frederik Andersen is currently entrenched as the Ducks’ No. 1 goalie.\nKhudobin, 29, was acquired from Carolina in June for defenseman James Wisniewski with the belief that he would be a viable option if Andersen was injured and the Ducks had to bring up Gibson. Khudobin’s first start for his fourth NHL team was only three games into the season.\n“I wasn’t surprised,” Khudobin said. “I (was) wondering when it was going to be. It just happened. Coach talked to me and I’m really happy about it.”\nThe move was supposed to help the Ducks avoid a situation like last season when they resorted to signing Ilya Bryzgalov in a failed experiment. Coach Bruce Boudreau decided to turn to the newcomer after Andersen opened with strong starts against San Jose and Vancouver.\n“We planned out the first three games,” Boudreau said. “Freddie deserved the first game and he deserved the home opener. … I talked to them before game one and let them know what was going on.\n“It’s Anton’s turn and he played great in preseason. Was the best goalie we had in preseason. So now we’re giving him the opportunity early because of how good he played in the preseason. If he hadn’t played well, we’d probably be going with Freddie.”\nThe way Wednesday went, it could be Andersen for the next while. The Ducks finish the homestand with games against Colorado and Minnesota before heading on the road for five games against the Central Division, including one against Stanley Cup champion Chicago.\nSTONER SCRATCHED\nDefenseman Clayton Stoner was scratched with what the Ducks called a lower-body injury. Stoner missed 10 games last season with injuries and was a healthy scratch in three others.\nIt gave Boudreau an opportunity to have Josh Manson make his season debut. Manson, who played in 28 games with the Ducks last season, earned a roster spot out of training camp with a strong performance in the preseason.\nThe Ducks signed Manson to a two-year, $1.65million extension in July, a one-way NHL deal that begins next summer.\nICE CHIPS\nDefenseman Kevin Bieksa appeared in his 600th NHL game. It is his third with the Ducks after spending his entire career with Vancouver. … Coyotes captain Shane Doan is three games away from appearing in 1,400, which would make him the 34th player in NHL history to do so.\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com\nRelated: Ducks-Coyotes box score", "external_links": ["http://sports.ocregister.com/nhl/boxscore.asp?gamecode=2015101425&home=25&vis=24"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:26:51.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
