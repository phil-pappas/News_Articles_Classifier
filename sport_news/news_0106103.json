I thought he did a really nice job for us today.\" \nAsked if the kickoff return gave the Eagles a jolt, Huff said: \"I felt like it gave the whole team a jolt. I really wanted to return it for a touchdown . . . It gave us a boost that we needed. I'm trying to do that every week, if the kicker's giving me a chance to bring the ball out.\" \nHuff, known as much for miscues as big plays during his rookie season, decided to punctuate his first career touchdown from scrimmage by crossing the goal line in a somersault. \n\"I haven't flipped since high school. I just thought it would be a grand opportunity to do so, with me so open,\" Huff said. \n\"(Tight end Zach) Ertz had a high angle route. I was coming across as a drag. I saw a hole and I just shot up in it, hoping Bradford was able to feed me, and he did . . . Ertz threw a couple blocks downfield.\" \nHuff got a slow start with a shoulder separation, lost a fumble his rookie year, and also basically handed an interception to a defender, causing him to lament last November that \"everything I've done has been going bad.\" \n\"Last year the game was a little bit fast for me, but this year, I know what to expect,\" Huff said yesterday. \"I know what the defense is trying to do, and I'm very aware of my surroundings and how to protect the ball.\" Birdseed \nFletcher Cox is the first Eagles player with three sacks and two forced fumbles since sacks became an official stat, in 1982 . . . Rookie inside linebacker Jordan Hicks has now recovered three fumbles, in successive weeks . . . outside linebacker Bryan Braman's sack was the first of his career . . . The 34 first downs were the most the Eagles have compiled under Chip Kelly . . . Donnie Jones punted only once, for 50 yards, 49 net . . . Right guard Matt Tobin said he practiced at left tackle Tuesday and Wednesday, then got one day in Thursday at guard with the group that started and finished the game, when left tackle Jason Peters (quad) was able to practice . . . That unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the Eagles' bench following a Drew Brees fumble was called on Kelly, he acknowledged. What did he do? \"Something you're not allowed to do, because you get a penalty for (it),\" Kelly said. \nOn Twitter: @LesBowen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:39:07.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
