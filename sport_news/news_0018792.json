They’ve got our team out of trouble in an almost dead-end situation in this campaign,” said Slutsky. \nZlatan Ibrahimovic put Sweden ahead in Solna with his 59th international goal and eighth in eight qualifiers before Erkan Zengin doubled their lead shortly after the interval. \nBut Erik Hamren’s team must come through a two-legged play-off next month if they are to qualify for a fifth successive European Championship finals. \nElsewhere in Group G, Marko Arnautovic scored once and Marc Janko netted a brace as group winners Austria signed off with a 3-0 defeat of Liechtenstein in Vienna. \nMeanwhile, Slovakia won through to a European Championship finals as an independent nation for the first time thanks to a 4-2 win in Luxembourg that guaranteed them second place in Group C behind reigning champions Spain. \nSlovakia came into the final round of qualifiers level on points with Ukraine, but knew a win at the Stade Josy Barthel would be enough, and they were quickly 3-0 up thanks to goals by Marek Hamsik, Adam Nemec and Robert Mak. \nMario Mutsch pulled one back just after the hour and then Lars Gerson netted a penalty for the hosts, but Napoli star Hamsik made sure of the win in stoppage time. \nIn any event, Slovakia would have qualified even in defeat as Ukraine lost 1-0 at to Spain in Kiev. \nAt the venue where they beat Italy in the Euro 2012 final, it was an unfamiliar-looking Spain side that won thanks to a debut goal by Villarreal full-back Mario Gaspar midway through the first half. \nCesc Fabregas captained the side as he won his 100th cap but, with his Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho watching from the stand, his evening was marred when his penalty was saved by Andriy Pyatov in the 25th minute. \nSpain had already won the group, while the defeat for Ukraine means they go into this weekend’s draw for the play-offs. \nAs a result, Hungary are poised to qualify as the best third-placed team, barring an unlikely sequence of results in Group A on Tuesday. \nEngland had already qualified from Group E but they made it a perfect 10 wins from 10 to end their campaign as Roy Hodgson’s team eased to a 3-0 victory over Lithuania in Vilnius. \nRoss Barkley’s deflected shot put England ahead before Lithuania goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis unluckily deflected Harry Kane’s shot into his own net for the second and Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain struck after the interval. \n“This is an achievement. I am very proud of the players’ performances,” Hodgson said. \n“The quality of play was good and 10 wins out of 10 is very satisfying. We’ve got to take a lot of pride in that,” added Hodgson, whose Lithuanian counterpart Igoris Pankratjevas announced his resignation post-game. \nAlready-qualified Switzerland won 1-0 in Estonia thanks to Ragnar Klavan’s injury-time own goal, while Slovenia confirmed third place and a play-off berth by winning 2-0 in San Marino with Bostjan Cesar and Nejc Pecnik on target. share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:27:20.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
