The product line will include duffel bags, document cases, iPad/iPhone sleeves, wallets and more.\nMinneapolis, MN (PRWEB) October 13, 2015\nWilliam Rogue & Co, an established outdoor retailer focusing on products Made in America, has teamed up with Marked Leather to develop a branded line of leather and canvas goods. The product line will include duffel bags, hunting accessories, iPad/iPhone sleeves, wallets and more.\nWilliam Rogue & Co was started in Minneapolis by Jeff Tietz, whose intent is to sell only products Made in America. Products that tell a story. Products that stand the test of time. “We are advocates for ‘less is more,’ buying fewer items but of higher quality, taking the time to learn about the product and the brand. Because when you do this, chances are you’re going to have these items for a really long time,” explains Tietz.\nWilliam Rogue is partnering with Scott Loeser of Marked Leather to help build this line of branded adventure gear. “We are thrilled to partner with Marked Leather,” said Tietz. “It’s great to be able to work with another local Minneapolis business to expand our offering and develop our branded line of outdoor adventure products.”\nThis fall, William Rogue and Marked Leather will unveil their line at popup shows local to the Minneapolis area. Products will also be available for purchase online at http://www.williamrogueandco.com prior to the holiday season.\nCurrently, Marked Leather produces its own unique line of bags and accessories from scratched, branded and scuffed pieces of leather.
