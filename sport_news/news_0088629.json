David Watford's string of consecutive games with a touchdown pass extended once more, as he completed 17 of his 30 passes for 206 yards – throwing completions to six different receivers. He also ran seven times for 22 yards. \nRashawn Proctor racked up a team-high 87 receiving yards on three catches – including an 80-yard touchdown. Twarn Mixson had a team-high six catches for 53 yards. Christopher Dukes ran 12 times for 78 yards, averaging 6.5 yards per carry. Jason George led the Pirates on defense with eight tackles, and Miles Grooms disrupted the backfield to the tune of two sacks and three quarterback hurries. Chaka Diarrassouba had an interception, while the Pirates forced three lost fumbles. \nIn addition to four turnovers, Morgan State (3-3, 3-1 MEAC) had just 276 yards on total offense. After a missed field goal from the Bears, the Pirates struck first with 4:06 left in the first quarter, when Watford hit Proctor from 80 yards to put Hampton up 7-0. Morgan State had driven into the red zone on the ensuing possession, only to have Moses Killon fumble the ball. Darius Banks recovered the fumble and ran it back 83 yards to put the Pirates up 14-0 with 12:34 left in the first half. Diarrassouba intercepted Skillon on the Bears' next possession, before Watford threw an interception of his own on the ensuing play. That gave the Bears their first scoring drive of the afternoon, when Chris Moller kicked a 49-yard field goal to cut the lead to 14-3. \nAdam Brown kicked a field goal of his own, a 33-yard boot, as the clock expired to give the Pirates a 17-3 halftime lead. Morgan State's only touchdown of the game came with 4:57 left in the third quarter, when Andrew King returned a punt 66 yards to cut the Pirates' lead to 17-10. But the Pirates put the game out of reach in the fourth quarter, thanks to a 16-play, 70-yard drive that took 8:26 off the clock. The drive ended with Brown's second field goal of the contest, a 31-yard boot that put Hampton up 20-10. Morgan State then went 47 yards in 10 plays before Moller missed a 42-yard field goal that would've made it a one-score game. Hampton took over with 1:35 left and ran out the clock for its second straight win.  //on.wvec.com/1ROV36W TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:00:54.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
