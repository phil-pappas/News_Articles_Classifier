(Photo: PTI/ File) Almere (The Netherlands): Indian shuttler Ajay Jayaram notched up a superb straight-game win over Estonia's Raul Must in the finals to defend his men's singles title at the Dutch Open Grand Prix here on Sunday.\nJust three weeks after reaching his maiden Super Series final at Korea Open, Jayaram continued his rampaging run as he defeated 12th seed and World No.48 Raul 21-12 21-18 in a 34-minute lop-sided match.\nA happy me :) pic.twitter.com/9anvykWsLX\n— Ajay Jayaram (@ajay_289) October 11, 2015 The 28-year-old Mumbai-born shuttler had lost to Raul way back in 2010 Austrian International Challenge but a lot has happened ever since as Jayaram dished out a dominating show to walk away with the title without much ado.\nIn men's doubles, Indian pair of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy, however, failed to cross the final hurdle and finished runners-up after losing 15-21 10-21 against seventh seed Kien Keat Koo and Boon Heong Tan of Malaysia.\nIn the opening game, World No. 26 Jayaram opened up a 4-0 lead early on and didn't allow Raul to come anywhere near him as he extended his lead and eventually earned the bragging rights.\nRaul, who had ended the run of another Indian RMV Gurusaidutt in the quarterfinals, showed signs of recovery in the second game when he turned the tables on Jayaram at 6-5 at the Topsportcentrum.\nBut the Indian quickly clawed back and broke off at 7-7 to keep his nose ahead even though Raul kept breathing down his neck. Jayaram, who is coached by Tom John at Bangalore, grabbed two match points first and then slammed the door on Must to clinch a deserving win.\nJayaram, who had won the Dutch Open, his maiden title last year, tweeted\nAmazing win today! Thank you guys so much for your love, support and wishes! #DutchOpen #TeamIndia\n— Ajay Jayaram (@ajay_289) October 11, 2015 This is the second title of his career.\nPages 1 2 next › last » Tags: Badminton Ajay Jayaram Dutch Open Grand Prix Raul Must Also Read Manu Attri, Sumeeth Reddy reach US Open grand prix doubles final Denmark Open: Saina, Sindhu knocked out in quarterfinals Saina, Srikanth storm into summit clash of China Open Saina, Kashyap reach prequarterfinals of Syed Modi GPG", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "https://twitter.com/ajay_289/status/653205355384672257", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://twitter.com/ajay_289/status/653210357108998144", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Ajay-Jayram_PTI_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamIndia?src=hash", "http://t.co/9anvykWsLX", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Ajay-Jayram_PTI_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/sports-other-sports/article/ajay-jayaram-clinches-dutch-open-title", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/DutchOpen?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-14T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:29:35.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
