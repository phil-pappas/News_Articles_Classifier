Learn what to do on a Colorado vacation to Winter Park this winter.\nWinter Park, Colo. (PRWEB) October 20, 2015\nAs implied in its name, Winter Park, Colo. , is a cold-weather playground for winter travelers. But it’s not just about great, family-friendly downhill skiing and snowboarding in Winter Park (though there is plenty of that at Winter Park Resort and Ski Granby Ranch !). There are also some wonderfully wacky (and incredibly fun) ways to enjoy wintertime in Winter Park without putting on a pair of skis or strapping on a snowboard. Here are the top 5.\nFat Biking\nThe Winter Park area – dubbed Mountain Bike Capital USA for its 600-plus miles of mountain bike trails – is now a four-season destination, thanks to the new way to ride all year long in the mountains. Fat biking – with its wide rims and extra-large tires – enables riders to enjoy Winter Park’s hundreds of miles of trails, even in the wintertime. Fat bike rentals are available at Beaver Sports Shop at the Best Western Hotel, Devil’s Thumb Ranch Resort & Spa, YMCA of the Rockies-Snow Mountain Ranch, and Epic Mountain Sports and Icebox Mountain Sports.\nTubing\nThe Winter Park area boasts six tubing hills – that’s more than any other Colorado destination! Some of the slopes also have lights to enable visitors to tackle tubing even after a day on the slopes. Choose from the Coca-Cola® Tubing Hill at Winter Park Resort, Colorado Adventure Park, the famed Fraser Tubing Hill, Grand Lake Nordic Center, YMCA of the Rockies-Snow Mountain Ranch, and the Town of Winter Park Sledding Hill.\nSleigh Rides\nFor an old-fashioned family experience, book a horse-drawn sleigh ride. Travelers can choose from a variety of tour lengths and packages – some of which even include meals – with local sleigh ride outfitters. Dashing Thru the Snow offers great family fun at an affordable price. Cabin Creek Stables at Devil's Thumb Ranch offers a wide variety of sleigh rides, including one hour, half hour, dinner, morning and evening feed options.

Dog Sled Rides of Winter Park has 80 Siberian and Alaskan huskies who can take visitors on an adventure that is sure to be a howling good time. Riders simply sit back and enjoy, while an experienced musher expertly guides them down a trail, pointing out wildlife/wildlife tracks, offering local history and answering guests’ questions.
