He refused to answer a question asking if his Indiana \"turned\" Louisville in to the NCAA. \n\"I would be very shocked if\" director of basketball operations Andre McGee, named in the book, was involved, Jurich said. \nJurich said the NCAA is working with U of L's private investigator to look into the allegations. He also said he doesn't have enough information yet to know if there's any validity to the allegations. \nHe also said all the log-in and log-out record books kept at Minardi Hall, U of L basketball's dormitory for players, have been turned over to Chuck Smrt, the private investigator, and the NCAA. \nJurich isn't sure if Smrt and the NCAA have reached out to former recruits, but he did say they've interviewed former players. \nJurich was asked why, if the allegations are untrue, someone would write a book like this. \"Follow the money,\" Jurich said. He also said he won't comment on if U of L was approached about a payout of some kind in exchange for the book's publication. \nJurich said he found out about the case through an Indiana University associate AD, who approached him after finding out a top booster for IU was looking for information about a picture. \nORIGINAL STORY: \nThe University of Louisville is looking into salacious allegations in a new book that say a former Cards basketball staffer paid escorts thousands of dollars to have sexual relations with both players and recruits during his time at the university. \nThe book in question is set to be released as soon as Saturday by Indianapolis-based IBJ Book Publishing LLC, the IBJ said. \nIt alleges that a former director of basketball operations, Andre McGee \"paid an escort service for four years to provide sex to teenage recruits to help woo the players to join the Cardinals team.\" McGee was on the U of L staff for four years before joining former Louisville assistant Kareem Richardson's staff at UMKC. \nU of L, in response to the upcoming book, put out a statement on Friday afternoon announcing that the school had hired Chuck Smrt, a private investigator from the Compliance Group, to conduct a \"thorough, objective review\" of the book's information. The Compliance Group, which is based in Kansas, provides an array of quality and cost effective NCAA compliance services to intercollegiate athletics departments and conference offices, according to its website. \nThe statement also said the school learned of the book and its allegations in late August and immediately launched its investigation with Smrt and notified the NCAA enforcement staff. U of L and the NCAA, the statement said, have been \"in regular communication.\" \n\"The University of Louisville will continue its review in full cooperation and coordination with the NCAA and, if warranted, take any appropriate action,\" the statement concluded. \"The allegations have been taken very seriously. In no way would anyone at this institution condone the alleged activities. To preserve the integrity of the review process, the university will withhold comment on any details until the review is concluded.\" \nThe book, written by Katina Powell with Dick Cady, is titled, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" according to a release from the IBJ. \nIn it, Powell, an escort, says she kept five journals logging her \"escort escapades, sexual encounters, murdered relatives and activities at the University of Louisville,\" the release says. Most of the U of L services she provided took place in the men's dormitory where basketball players reside (Minardi Hall), according to Powell. \nHer main contact was McGee. \n\"She has hundreds of text exchanges with him to set up her services, as well as pictures of her girls with players and recruits,\" the release says. \nYahoo Sports reports more than $10,000 was exchanged between Powell and U of L.
