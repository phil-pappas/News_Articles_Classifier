She later retracted the accusation but the International Olympic Committee awarded the Canadians duplicate gold medals. \nThe ISU suspended Le Gougne and Gailhaguet for three years in April 2002, and banned them from the 2006 Turin Olympics. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:10:27.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
