But enough about Donald Trump.\nActually, I was thinking more about Steve Jobs, a sometime jerk and sometime good guy who achieved more in his complicated life than certain other famous people currently in the news (see above).\nIn death, Jobs remains larger than life. He is the Apple of our eye, but, as with real apples, blemishes have a way of appearing on the skin and worms inside the core.\nA famous Gary Larson “Far Side” cartoon had the Almighty as a chef cooking up the world and seasoning it with a shaker labeled Jerks, “just to make it interesting.” Irritating and exasperating are other words that might apply. In Jobs’ case, inspiring too.\nThe obnoxious genius factor may explain the public’s continuing fascination with Jobs. The trailer for the movie “Steve Jobs,” currently showing in some cinemas with wide release on Friday, suggests blemishes and worms aplenty to devour with our popcorn.\nThis is the latest in a number of movies about Jobs, Apple’s co-founder and world-changing pioneer of personal computers and devices such as the iPhone. Critics have said the new movie does not reflect the reality of the man. No doubt you are shocked that a movie has taken liberties with its subject.\nFor a more serious treatment, I recently got around to reading his authorized biography, “Steve Jobs,” by Walter Isaacson. It was published in 2011, shortly after Jobs died of pancreatic cancer at age 56.\nIf you are like me — technologically deficient and still suspecting that tiny people live inside computers to do the work, probably for tiny wages — the book’s description of technological breakthroughs is a challenge. The more interesting story for me is the contrarian man.\nI wish the man who created the iPhone had been able to see more i to i with those with whom he personally interacted. As William Shakespeare might have written today, “The evil that men do lives after them on the Internet / the good is oft interred in the cloud.”\nThat Jobs allowed his official biographer to be entirely frank is very much to his credit. If I ever commission a biography, it will be on the strict understanding that I will be portrayed continually patting puppies while performing humanitarian works.\nSteve Jobs was bigger than that, something to remember in the cinema.\nReg Henry is a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:09:44.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
