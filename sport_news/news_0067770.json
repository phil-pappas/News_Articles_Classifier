In order to get that, you have to keep winning. \n\"There's only three college football games that night. We're the prime-time college game. We have to come out with a big performance.\" \nThe Bears were very much in the spotlight a week ago Saturday when they faced Utah in a battle of the Pac-12's two remaining unbeaten teams. Cal lost 30-24 on the road to a Utah squad now ranked No. 3, and managed to holds its No. 23 spot in the rankings. After a bye week, the Bears (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12) climbed three spots Sunday. \n\"I guess they liked the way we played. I don't know what they would like about it,\" said Cal quarterback Jared Goff, who threw a career-high five interceptions in the loss. \nCoach Sonny Dykes admitted Monday he didn't even know that UCLA (4-2, 1-2) was made anywhere from a 3½ to a 7-point favorite for their game at the Rose Bowl until someone mentioned it to him. Advertisement \nBut Dykes understands why his program — which produced a 1-11 season just two years ago — has not yet won over everyone. The Bears have not beaten the Bruins in Pasadena since 2009, although they lost just 36-34 last year at home. \n\"I think respect is earned and it's not easily earned,\" he said. \"We have to continue to play well to earn people's respect.\" \nAccording to Cal, the Bears' home game against USC on Halloween (Oct. 31) will be at noon or 12:30 p.m., though the exact time and network haven't been determined. \nGoff talked with reporters Sunday after practice for the first time since turning 21 last week and showed the calm wisdom of his years. \nIt took him just a couple days to get over his rough game at Utah, Goff said, and that he never felt like things snowballed on him that night. \n\"I never really thought I wavered. They made plays and we didn't,\" he said. \"Again, that was how many days ago . . . we're over it. I'm over it. We're ready to move on and play well against UCLA.\" \nGoff said he doesn't feel any need to vindicate himself against UCLA. \n\"No, I'm just going to play the way I play every game and let the ball fall where it may. I'm going to play my best,\" he said. \"I've prepared pretty hard this week and I'm ready to go. \n\"I don't feel I have to prove anyone right or wrong. I'm going to play my best game and whatever happens happens.\" \nFreshman defensive end Cameron Saffle, who spent the summer and first five games of this season rehabbing after ACL knee surgery, played at Utah because he was physically ready and willing, Dykes explained. \"We think he's going to help us win games down the stretch,\" Dykes said. \nThis is the first week since 1993 that both Cal (No. 20) and Stanford (No. 10) are ranked in the AP Top-25 and USC and UCLA are not.
