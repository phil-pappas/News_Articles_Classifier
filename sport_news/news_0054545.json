(AP Photo/Isaac Brekken) more > By MICHAEL MARTINEZ - Associated Press   \nLAS VEGAS (AP) - Canada’s David Hearn birdied his final three holes in perfect morning conditions for a 7-under 64 and a share of the lead Thursday in the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. \nMichael Thompson, Mark Hubbard and Tyler Aldridge also topped the leaderboard at TPC Summerlin. Aldridge had two holes left when first-round play was suspended because of darkness. \nHearn had eight birdies and a bogey. \n“The course was playing pretty much perfect as it’s going to get,” Hearn said. “The greens were great this morning. I think that there’s a reason there’s a lot of good scores on that board. It’s because the course is in such good shape.” \nPatrick Rodgers, Patton Kizzire, Chad Campbell, Ryan Palmer, Ricky Barnes, D.H. Lee, Ryo Ishikawa, Greg Owen, Shane Bertsch and Brendon Todd shot 65, and Henrik Norlander also was 6 under with two holes left. \nLee birdied six of his first seven holes, then bogeyed the next two. \nKizzire is making his first start as a PGA Tour member after winning twice last year on the Web.com Tour and topping the regular-season and finals-combined money lists. He was married Saturday. \nJimmy Walker opened with a 66, and U.S. Presidents Cup teammate Rickie Fowler had a 72. \nThompson and Hubbard eagled the par-5 16th, with Hubbard holing 30-foot putt and Thompson a 25-footer in their morning rounds. Thompson also had seven birdies and a double bogey. \n“It definitely helps when there’s no wind and real calm and sunny,” Thompson said. “The only thing that we really have to consider is the cold in the morning. … It helps when the greens are a little bit receptive and they’re rolling perfect.” \nHubbard had the eagle, six birdies and a bogey. He played a three-hole stretch in 4 under with birdies on Nos. 14 and 15 and the eagle on 16, but bogeyed the 17th and closed with a par. \n“I’ve kind of just taken a little bit of a chill pill recently, and I’m playing a lot better golf,” Hubbard said. \nHe got into the field as an alternate when Matt Every withdrew. \n“It’s a nice opportunity to have,” Hubbard said. \nWalker closed with a bogey on the par-5 ninth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:42:42.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
