(AP) - Titans wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham is back at work after being arrested last week on a warrant for an unpaid speeding ticket in Missouri during Tennessee's bye week.\nMissouri police stopped Green-Beckham on Sept. 30 for driving 65 in a 55-mph zone, and Van Buren police Chief Nick J. McBroom said Tuesday officers found an outstanding warrant from Osage Beach, Missouri. Green-Beckham was arrested before bonding out paying $92.48 for failure to appear over a speeding ticket.\nGreen-Beckham was given a warning for last week's stop.\nDismissed from the Missouri Tigers in April 2014, the receiver spent the season at Oklahoma after his transfer was denied. Considered a first-round draft pick, Green-Beckham wasn't drafted until No. 40 by the Titans.\nWKRN-TV in Nashville first reported the arrest.\n\nOnline:\nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
