The veteran defenseman, who is in Pittsburgh’s camp on a PTO, has struggled mightily with coverage in his own zone—no surprise to anyone who watched him work the revolving door the past two seasons in Dallas and Montreal. Gonchar was on the ice for two more goals-against in Wednesday night’s 7–2 loss to Detroit. That, according to beat writer Jason Mackey, means he’s been out there for nine of the 20 that have been scored on the Pens so far in exhibition action while he’s been in the lineup. No doubt Gonchar still has something to offer at the other end of the ice, but that’s not this team’s pressing concern. If he’s a liability defensively, it’s impossible to justify keeping him around.\nGonchar’s partner last night, Derrick Pouliot , might not be long for the Pens himself. He’s been on the ice for 11 of the 21 goals scored against Pittsburgh on nights he’s dressed and has been soundly outplayed by Adam Clendening. With Kris Letang, Olli Maatta, Ben Lovejoy, Rob Scuderi, Ian Cole and Brian Dumoulin likely to stick, Pouliot seems destined for assignment.\n• One bright spot for the Pens has been the play of Daniel Sprong . The team’s first pick in the 2015 draft (46th) scored one of Pittsburgh’s goals last night to extend what’s been a very strong camp. “He looked like he belongs,” said one scout who caught the 18-year-old in action recently. “Quick, creative and playing with a lot of confidence. He’s not intimidated by his surroundings the way a lot of kids his age might be. He looks better away from the puck than I expected.” The numbers game suggests he’s still a long shot to make the opening night roster, but Sprong has made an excellent first impression.\nNHL Red Wings' coach change may open door to top prospects like Dylan Larkin by Allan Muir", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@almuirSI"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:57:24.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
