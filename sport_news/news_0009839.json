The investigation agency has sought permission for interrogation of Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh in the disproportionate assets case. Amid hectic political activity, the talk of the town is the outcome of the hearing. While loyalists and detractors of Virbhadra are weighing various options, the Opposition is demanding his ouster. Former Union Communication Minister Sukh Ram today met state Congress chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu at the HPCC office today. While the Congress leaders termed it a usual session, observers said there was more to what was being projected. Soon after the return of the Chief Minister this afternoon, all 11 Cabinet ministers issued a joint statement, “expressing solidarity with Virbhadra. They said the politics of vendetta and vengeance unleashed by the BJP against the CM would never succeed. It is learnt that six senior lawyers, including former union ministers Kapil Sibal and P Chidambaram, are likely to appear for the CM in the apex court tomorrow. However, BJP leaders have been making prophecies about the change of guard in the Congress. They said the state was heading for the mid-term Assembly poll. After the CBI raids at 13 locations, including the residences of Virbhadra on September 26, the CM had moved the Himachal Pradesh High Court which restrained the CBI from arresting Virbhadra and his wife Pratibha Singh in the disproportionate assets case but allowed the inquiry to proceed. A division bench comprising Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Sureshwar Thakur had directed the CBI to keep the court informed before interrogating the couple and fixed the next hearing on November 18. Following this, the CBI moved the Supreme Court for permission to interrogate Virbhadra. The agency told the court that it wanted to question the CM “but the investigation was stuck as the High Court had stopped it from interrogating Virbhadra”. The CBI has asked the apex court to transfer the case from the the HC to Delhi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:11:03.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
