They use a \"shock and shed\" approach. Deliver a vicious blow to the blocker, then separate and go to the ball, whether it's in the arms of a running back or in the hands of a quarterback.\nYesterday, Cox gave Brees and the Saints' offensive line fits, registering three of the Eagles' five sacks and forcing fumbles on two of them that led to scores. He also had three hurries and a team-high six tackles as the Eagles held the Saints to 96 rushing yards. \nThe Eagles forced four New Orleans turnovers that they turned into 19 points. They already have 13 takeaways in their first five games. \nTheir five sacks nearly matched the six they had in the first four games. \n\"They come in bunches,'' Davis said of sacks. \"And today you had Brees, instead of throwing the ball a few times and risking an interception, he ate (the ball) and took some of those sacks. \n\"The guys did a great job in coverage tonight. (Brees) was holding the ball because the coverage was what it was. Interceptions are tied to pass rush and sacks are tied to coverage.'' \nWhile the Eagles gave up a season-high seven \"X\" plays (pass plays of 20 yards or more), they also did a good job of tying up Brees' receivers and forcing him to hold on to the ball longer than he normally does. \n\"It's a shame (about the 'X' plays),'' Davis said. \"We finally went into the top five in the league in not giving up 'X' plays. So we were excited about that. But it came back and stung us tonight. \n\"We played a little bit more man (coverage) tonight than we usually do. And sometimes in man coverage, when one guy stumbles a little bit, the 'X' plays can happen. But we'll fix that. We'll keep working on them.'' \nThe five sacks were the most by the Eagles since they sacked the Titans' immobile Zack Mettenberger five times last November. Needless to say, sacking Brees five times is a slightly bigger accomplishment, particularly considering the fact that they came in a game the Eagles absolutely, positively had to win. \nCox's three sacks were the most he's had since, well, ever. \n\"Probably never,'' he said. \"Not even in college, high school, never. First time I've ever had three sacks in one game.'' \nThe three sacks were nice, the two forced fumbles were even nicer. \n\"We preach it all the time,'' Cox said. \"No quarterback likes people around their elbows, around their arms. That's always the goal. Instead of going after the big hit, go after the football.'' \nCox is a down-in-and-down-out disruptive force. The only defensive lineman in the league who might be better than him right now is J.J. Watt. And the gap between them is closing, though Cox probably never will have the sack numbers Watt has because of the two-gap scheme in which he plays. \n\"They're both big impact players,'' said Eagles nose tackle Beau Allen, who played with Watt at Wisconsin. \"The thing that stands out to me about Fletcher is that he can play all over the line. You see him line up over center, guard, tackle, tight end. It really doesn't faze him at all. He's athletic enough to play wherever he wants.'' \nIt's no coincidence that the Saints' longest run, a 17-yarder by Mark Ingram late in the third quarter, came when Cox was on the sideline getting a breather. \n\"He's one of the best in the league at what he does,'' nose tackle Bennie Logan said. \"He doesn't get the credit he deserves. But he doesn't let it bother him. He just goes out there and lets his work speak for him. \n\"After a game like this, I think people finally are going to start putting him up there and talking about him with some of the other top guys.'' \nSaid Davis: \"He's a Pro Bowl-caliber player. I've been around a long time and that's what they look like. They play the run. They can get disruption in the passing game. Sack numbers come and go, but he has the skill set.'' \nLast week, Cox knocked the Redskins' Pro Bowl left tackle, Trent Williams, to the ground with one arm and stuffed a cutback run. Yesterday, he gave every Saints offensive lineman he lined up across from fits. \nHis first sack in the second quarter put the brakes on a New Orleans drive that made it to the Eagles' 28-yard line. He knocked the ball out of Brees' hands on his second sack. It was recovered by rookie linebacker Jordan Hicks and the Eagles were able to turn it into a 39-yard Caleb Sturgis field goal with 10 seconds left in the first half, giving them a 10-7 lead. \nOn his third sack, he beat the Saints' rookie left tackle, Andrus Peat, and not only stripped the ball from Brees, but also recovered it himself at the New Orleans 13. The Eagles scored on the very next play when Sam Bradford hit wide open Brent Celek in the end zone. \n\"We went into the game expecting a lot of quick passes (from Brees),'' said Logan, who also had a sack to go with three tackles for losses. \"But he was holding on to the ball because of the good job our guys were doing in coverage. It allowed us to get pressure on him and get some sacks.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:08:28.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
