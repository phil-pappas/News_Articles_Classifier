But not a lot of people throw out their favorite nose tackle or guard when asked about the best players they've ever seen.\nBut the fact is that the Jersey Shore has produced some great ones over the years, and they've helped teams win state championships, national championships and Super Bowls.\nIt's time for them to get their due.\nI've collected a list of some of the best offensive and defensive linemen for the latest in our series on the greatest players ever from Monmouth and Ocean counties.\nIn the coming weeks we will be rolling out the rest of the stories, including receivers (Oct. 27), quarterbacks (Nov. 3) and running backs (Nov. 10). And it’s not too late to provide input, so feel free to contact me: via email at sedelson@gannettnj.com ; follow me on Twitter and send me a direct message; or go to my Facebook page and comment.\nNow here's a look at the guys who did all the dirty work in the trenches:\nThomas Carroll, Lakewood – An All-State defensive end for the Piners in 2000, the 6-5, 225-pound Carroll registered 112 tackles and 19 sacks as a senior.\nCarroll was a freshman redshirting in 2001 when the Miami Hurricanes won the national championship, and a year later played for the team that lost in the national championship game, falling to Ohio State in overtime in the Fiesta Bowl. Carroll finished his career in Coral Gables with 14.5 sacks and 29 tackles for losses.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/steveedelsonapp", "https://www.facebook.com/steve.edelson.33?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:08:08.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
