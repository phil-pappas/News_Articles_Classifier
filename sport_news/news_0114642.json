OK, maybe not.\nBut the fact is the Bruins don’t exactly ease into their 2015-16 schedule. In tonight’s season opener at the Garden, they play a good Winnipeg Jets team, and it only gets tougher from there with archrival Montreal coming into town for a Saturday night game, and then defending Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay here for a Columbus Day matinee before the team heads west for games in Colorado and Arizona.\nIt’s clear that this Bruins team is a work in progress, and management has said that improvement will be the key, but getting off to a quick start wouldn’t hurt the confidence.\n“You always want to get off to a good start,” said forward Matt Beleskey . “I don’t think there are three teams that you could pick and say it would be an easy three games. It’s going to be fun, it’s going to be a tough first week, but that’s perfect. It’s a good test.”\nMaking his B’s debut, Beleskey will be one of several players who may have an extra butterfly or two. Another will be Dorchester’s Jimmy Hayes, obtained in a trade from Florida in the offseason. It’s been rare to see Hayes without a smile on his face since that day, and he is certainly stoked for the opener.\n“I think it’s going to be a pretty cool moment for me, just being a hometown kid and being able to play that first home game. I just want to take it in and be ready to play,” said Hayes. “I always tried to imagine (playing for the Bruins). When I finally made pro I was hoping one day it would happen, and now it’s here. It’s going to be a special moment.”\nStill no word on Z\nThere was no definitive word on the status of Zdeno Chara , who is on injured reserve with an undisclosed upper body injury.\nHe skated with the team for the second straight day and came out early for the power-play practice, as a substitute on the second unit. He also stayed on the ice for a while after practice.\n“He’s a guy who’s getting better all the time. Haven’t had a chance to chat with him,” said coach Claude Julien . “I know there’s a decision to be made as far as (the opener) is concerned, whether we take him off IR or we leave him on. I don’t have that answer, but I know he’s feeling a lot better.\n“Early in the season, we have to make a decision here on whether he’s well enough that we can take that risk or whether we want to be more cautious. That’s a discussion I’m sure is going to happen at some point before (tonight).”\nChara was also noncommittal.\n“I was just focusing on having a good practice today,” said Chara. “That went well, so again, we’re going to be looking toward tomorrow to have a better feeling and better knowledge.”\nChara played just three shifts in the preseason before suffering the injury on Sept. 24.\nCenters of attention\nSpeaking of the power play, the B’s had a first unit with the team’s top three centers — Patrice Bergeron , David Krejci and Ryan Spooner — with Loui Eriksson and Torey Krug . Last year, before Krejci suffered a knee injury in February, Julien tried a loaded-up first unit that was designed to play most of the power play, but he said that this wasn’t necessarily the case just yet.\n“We’ll see how it goes,” Julien said. “We’ve got to give an opportunity for those guys to earn that right or other guys to earn more power-play time. It could be on a game-to-game basis, too.\n“The one thing I do know is I feel we have enough depth, especially up front, to garner a couple of good power plays. We’ll see where that goes, but it’s tough to make an assessment before the season starts, until you get to see it in the real action.”\nOne player who wasn’t on either power-play unit was the talented 19-year-old David Pastrnak , who acknowledged he had to earn his way into that role.\n“All the guys have to earn their spot on the team. I just have to do my best. We are here as a team and that’s the way it is. If you want to win, you have to be a good team, no matter if you play first or fourth line, or power play or not. That’s the way the team works,” said Pastrnak, who nonetheless would like to see some man-advantage time.\n“Definitely. I’ve played the power play since I was a kid, so it’s definitely different. But it’s a different level here. It’s the best players in the world. So, yeah, I’m going to work and do my best and get better.” . . .\nWinger Seth Griffith , who saw any chance of making the team go out the window when he suffered an MCL strain early in camp, has begun skating again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:37:55.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
