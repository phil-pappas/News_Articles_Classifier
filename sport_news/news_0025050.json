See him running up and down the aisles, yelling, laughing, clanging the seats, not a care in the world as he makes such a scene that it’s impossible not to notice him.\nThis was more than 30 years ago. I was covering the minor-league Maine Mariners hockey team for the Portland Press Herald, and the director of operations for the Cumberland County Civic Center was a fellow named Lee Roy.\nThe little kid running around during the Mariners’ morning skates was his kid, Travis Roy. He was a gnat, a firefly, a happily out-of-control little boy with places to go and the unlimited energy to pay the freight.\n“Before ADHD was a common diagnosis, I have no doubt that was probably me,” he says now, remembering it all so well. “I grew up in the Cumberland County Civic Center. I don’t know that there’s a cooler gymnasium for a 7-year-old to have — to be able to run around a 7,000-seat arena and think you can do whatever you want.”\nWe are sitting in the living room of Roy’s comfortable, tastefully-decorated Back Bay condo. A lot of spectacularly generous people raised the money to make this place possible, and it has all kinds of special bells and whistles that you don’t really notice, or don’t choose to notice, because you’re distracted by the framed autographed photos of such luminaries as Bobby Orr, Muhammad Ali . . . George Burns.\nGeorge Burns?\n“Huge fan of ‘Oh God,’’’ he said, revealing that there’s still a lot of little kid inside Travis Roy.\n“I had so much energy back then,” he said, taking us back to his days growing up in Yarmouth, Maine. “I remember my whole life, my knee tapping. All the time. I’d be sitting there and I’d look down and my knee would be tapping, tapping. Whether I was in the classroom, before a game, after a game, I could not stop moving.”\nHe doesn’t bother to take note of the irony of that remark. Yet just a few moments later, while filling in some of the blanks as relates to his active and spirited efforts on behalf of the Travis Roy Foundation to fund research into spinal injuries, he said, “Pardon the pun, but I can’t sit around. I want to be doing something. I want to be productive. It sounds like a simple word, but it fits. I want to be productive, whether it’s to benefit others, or my family, or to entertain myself. I need to be productive, doing something.”\nHow many times has Travis Roy, now 40 years old, used that line about not wanting to sit around? Today being the 20th anniversary of his accident, it is not lost on him that he has spent half his life in a wheelchair, half his life depending on professional caregivers to assist him through each day, half his life hoping he will one day gain a measure of independence.\n“I’m not going to walk again,” he said, but pausing now to amend this gloomy forecast: “I doubt that I’ll walk again. But I want to be independent again. And I think that’s realistic.”\nIt’s only realistic because people like Travis Roy continue to fight the fight. And so he travels, he makes speeches, he does interviews. But again, it has been 20 long years. And after 20 years, he fights a new kind of battle: Choosing between telling people what he thinks they want to hear, or sharing the intimate details into what it’s really like to be a quadriplegic.\nOn this day, he chooses candor.\n“I’ll be honest with you, I’m tired right now,’ he said. “I am tired. Usually it’s pretty good. If I’m healthy, I can handle being paralyzed and I can do a lot. It’s when I’m sick, it’s when I have a urinary tract infection, pneumonia. Being sick and paralyzed is what really freaks me out.”\nThere are times, he said, “. . . when I’m a little too positive . . . Part of me wants to make it look a little easier so that when people see me they don’t have to know about the two hours I spent this morning with my care attendant bathing me, dressing me, shaving me, brushing my teeth. It’s so personal. I’ve had probably 300 different care attendants over the years . . . and home care’s a tough business. Opening up your life to very personal care. I generally don’t talk about that. But I realize people need to hear that part of it too.”\nHe knows his support system is better than it is for most people in his situation. And he’ll tell you, always, how grateful he is for his family, his friends, his relationship with the hockey community. And he still gets buoyed by the support of complete strangers; during our time together he noted how moved he was by a random Facebook message that had come his way.\nStrangers are important. Strangers mean new ideas, new hope, perhaps new donations being sent to the many hospitals and research centers that are dedicated to spinal cord injuries.\n“I just want to put some urgency to this,” Roy said. “Twenty years. I cannot believe I’m doing this for 20 years. I thought the Travis Roy Foundation would be out of business in five of 10 years. I really did.”\nIn that respect, Travis Roy is still that little kid running up and down the aisles at the Cumberland County Civic Center.\n“That little boy had a passion,” he said. “He had a passion for hockey, a love for hockey. It was really neat waking up with that love.\n“This,” he said, “isn’t as fun. It isn’t nearly as fun. But it has more value. I recognize that. And it has meaning that I never would have had as a hockey player.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:15:53.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
