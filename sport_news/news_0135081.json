It would make the goal on Thursday a bit more meaningful if it helped us get to the Euros. \n\"It was a great night, but we have got to focus on Poland now. As I said, we have got to make it mean something.\" \nLong will hope his efforts against the Germans will give him a chance of starting at the Narodowy Stadium on a night when Seamus Coleman and Marc Wilson return to contention after injury and Glenn Whelan and James McClean from suspension. \nKeeper Shay Given has withdrawn with a knee problem and full-back Stephen Ward did not travel after his efforts on Thursday took their toll. \nBut Poland too have issues, with dangerous frontman Arkadiusz Milik sidelined, although with Robert Lewandowski currently in the form of his life O'Neill is under few illusions as to how difficult his side's task will be. \nHe said: \"He [Milik] being missing is obviously a blow to Poland. He's a brilliant player, he really has been exceptional, particularly in the tournament. But I don't think they are short of too of many ready-made replacements. \n\"I'd say outside the very, very best players playing in the world, [Lionel] Messi and [Cristiano] Ronaldo, Lewandowski is in a bracket of a number of players that you would say is not far behind. It's really brilliant when you have someone like that there to rely on. \n\"He's been exceptional for them and they are going to cause you plenty of problems. But we have to cope with that and try to come through.\" \nMeanwhile, O'Neill insisted he knew nothing about reports that he will be offered a two-year contract extension as a reward for his efforts to date, although Press Association Sport understands that will be the case. \nHe said: \"No, I have nothing to say about it, the situation is exactly the same as before. Whatever reports have come out, it's news to me.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:59:06.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
