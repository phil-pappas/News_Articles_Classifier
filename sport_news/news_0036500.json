(AP Photo/Bob Levey, File) \nHOUSTON (AP) — The Astros have postponed a planned renovation of center field at Minute Maid Park that would have removed Tal’s Hill and shortened the distance from the plate from 436 to 409 feet. \nTeam president Reid Ryan says that the Astros still plan for the renovations eventually but the construction timelines in the bidding process made clear the project could not be finished by next year’s home opener. \nHouston said its playoff run coupled with an international cricket match in November impacted the construction timelines. \nHouston’s center field is the deepest in the majors, and the $15 million renovation the team announced in June would have made it the sixth-deepest in the majors. Tal’s Hill, a tribute to Cincinnati’s Crosley Field and other old ballparks, is named after former longtime Astros executive Tal Smith.
