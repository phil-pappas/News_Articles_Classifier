Indiana won Game 1 of that series as well en route to the franchise’s only championship. \n“We just believe in one another,” Fever coach Stephanie White said. “We trust one another and we understand that no matter what happens through the course of a game, if we come together we’re going to put ourselves in a position to win.” \nMaya Moore had 27 points and 12 rebounds and Sylvia Fowles add 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Lynx. But Minnesota missed 8 of 23 free throws and turned the ball over 15 times to drop the opener. \n“How do we lose that game?” Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said after they held Indiana to 36 percent shooting. “We just didn’t do the little things at key times.” \nGame 2 in the best-of-five series is Tuesday night in Minneapolis. \nVeteran Tamika Catchings had 12 points, six rebounds and four assists for the Fever, who never got rattled by Minnesota’s boisterous home crowd. They outscored Minnesota 22-12 in second-chance points. \nThe Lynx were 19-2 at Target Center in their playoff history, the best winning percentage in the WNBA. The last time they had lost at home in the playoffs was against the Fever in 2012. \nThis one followed a similar script, with the determined and gritty Fever absorbing several haymakers from the Lynx and pushing back each time. \nJanuary – the Lewis and Clark HS grad and tough-as-nails daughter of a karate instructor who has a black belt herself – led the way. She knocked down two tough jumpers late in the third quarter when the Lynx had pulled within four and was right there in the end to ice it. \nAfter the Lynx charged back to take a 62-61 lead with 4:28 to play, Coleman hit a 3 and scored on a backdoor cut off an inbounds pass. \nThen January crossed over Anna Cruz, Minnesota’s best perimeter defender, for a layup and a 68-63 lead. \n“I challenged Bri to lead this team,” Catchings said. “To lead us on the defensive end, to lead us on the offensive end. When she plays the way she knows how to play defensively, she gets under people’s skin so bad. It’s fun to watch.” \nJanuary added another pull-up jumper before fouling out with 1:12 to play, and the Fever closed out another gutsy road victory. \n“We heard the fans going, everything was loud,” January said. “They were going on a run, but we just came together and stayed united in those moments.” \nSeimone Augustus had a quiet nine points on 3-for-11 shooting and Lindsay Whalen only attempted three shots for Minnesota. \nThe Lynx are playing in their fourth finals in the last five years. They have won two championships, but were stunned by the Fever in 2012, a loss that ultimately prevented what could have been a run of three straight titles. \nAfter losing to Phoenix in the Western Conference finals last season, the Lynx avenged the defeat by sweeping the Mercury in the conference finals this year to set up a rematch with the only team to beat them in the finals. \n© Copyright 2015 Associated Press.
