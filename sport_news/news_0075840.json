They also didn’t account for the women’s weight.\nIt’s also possible that although the study accounted for exercise, the data may not have painted a complete picture of whether or not women were constantly in motion as they went about their daily lives, noted Robert Newton, Jr., an exercise expert at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n“We currently do not know how vigorously people need to fidget to get a potential benefit,” Newton, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.\nFidgetiness may also be a marker of a person who is hard-wired to move around a lot, said Dr. James Levine, a researcher at Arizona State University and the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n“The fidget itself is actually a reflection of the brain sending out a signal to get moving,” said Levine, who wasn’t involved in the study. “If you can get out and walk around you do that, but if you are stuck behind a desk with a pile of work to do then you just make all the little movements you can.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:06:54.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
