Because the teammate part rules the present, Turner sounded very diplomatic when asked about Utley.\n“There’s definitely guys in the league you’re aware of, especially when you’re playing in the middle, that you know they’re going to come in hard every single time. And you’ve got to be able to try to protect yourself. He’s a guy that plays balls-to-the wall and goes in hard. He’s old school,” Turner said of Utley, at the center of baseball’s current raging controversy.\n“If you’re not protecting yourself or you’re not in a good position when they come in hard like that, you have a chance of getting hurt.”\nUtley came in hard and late against defenseless, back-turned-to-him Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada who was taken out in a slide that fractured his right leg Saturday in Game 2 of the NLDS.\nAfter reviewing the play, MLB chief baseball officer Joe Torre Sunday suspended Utley for Games 3 and 4 determining the slide “warrants discipline” while noting his belief there was no intent to injure. But the veteran Dodger plans to appeal, and the case could be heard on Monday.\nSunday night, after Utley’s agent called his client’s ban “outrageous and completely unacceptable,” the Dodgers released a statement supporting their player’s appeal.\n“The Dodgers stand behind Chase Utley and his decision to appeal the suspension issued tonight by Major League Baseball. The club will have no further comment at this time,” the team said.\nAccording to Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports, Utley sent an apology to Tejada through a Met, David Wright, after the Dodgers evened the NLDS at 1-1 with a 5-2 Game 2 victory in Los Angeles.\nUtley after the game maintained he was just doing his job.\n“You’re taught from a young age to try to break up double-plays. That’s winning baseball,” Utley said Saturday before later stressing, “any time you have an opportunity to break up a double play, you should do your best to do that. Again it was one of those awkward, awkward plays.”\nUtley, who has a long history of torturing the Mets, repeatedly claimed after the fact he had no intent to injure. He had two weak answers about the lateness of the slide plus the perilous nature of Tejada, whose back was turned.\n“I guess it really depends on who you’re talking to,” Utley said about being late. “But again there was no intent to injure Ruben whatsoever.”\nAbout Tejada being defenseless, Utley said, “My focus was seeing the ball. I didn’t realize his back was turned. Everything obviously happened fast.”\nDodgers teammates, being teammates, supported Utley.\n“Everyone knows how hard Chase plays the game and did what everyone would do going hard to break up the double-play,” Turner said. “We don’t want to see anyone get hurt, but hopefully … it’s not too bad and doesn’t affect anything with [Tejada’s] career.”\nHowie Kendrick, who hit the ball that resulted in the controversy, claimed the play is “part of the game.”\n“It’s baseball,” Kendrick said. “He probably did slide late. It’s kind of unfortunate the guy ended up hurt…You play it hard but it’s never with the intention to hurt anybody. It [stinks] he ended up hurt but at the same time you’re playing the game and you’re trying to do the best for your team and Chase, I felt like he had a good baseball play there.”\nDodgers Game 3 starter Brett Anderson tweeted, “What a joke …” after the ruling.\nUtley was harpooned elsewhere on social media. Atlanta great Chipper Jones tweeted: “That was not a slide and that is not how u ‘go in hard’!”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chase utley ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  ruben tejada", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:18:50.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
