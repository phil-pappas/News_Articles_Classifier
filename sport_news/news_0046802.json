Her comments went viral and the publisher swiftly decided to rewrite the section.\nThe offending passage was in pages titled Patterns of Immigration in McGraw-Hill Education’s World Geography book. A colourful map of the US was adorned with a speech bubble which said: “The Atlantic Slave Trade between the 1500s and 1800s brought millions of workers from Africa to the southern United States to work on agricultural plantations.”\nDean-Burren, and thousands of others who reacted on social media, objected to a choice of words which seems to imply that slaves were economic migrants.\n“Immigrants. Yeah, that word matters – immigrants,” she said. “So it is now considered immigration.”\nShe pointed to a section on the facing page that described Europeans who came to the US to work as indentured servants, for little or no pay.\n“They say that about English and European people, but there is no mention of African immigrants working as slaves or being slaves. It just says that we were workers,” she said .\nLast Friday, McGraw-Hill Education issued a statement saying it would change the wording in future editions: “We conducted a close review of the content and agree that our language in that caption did not adequately convey that Africans were both forced into migration and to labor against their will as slaves.\n“We believe we can do better. To communicate these facts more clearly, we will update this caption to describe the arrival of African slaves in the US as a forced migration and emphasize that their work was done as slave labor. These changes will be reflected in the digital version of the program immediately and will be included in the program’s next print run.”\nIn response, Dean-Burren wrote on Facebook: “This is change people!!! This is why your voices matter!!! You did this!!!”\nIt is far from the only controversy surrounding Texas textbooks, which in recent years have become a battleground for ideological disputes.\nIn 2010, Christian conservatives on the Texas board of education approved a curriculum that they saw as redressing liberal biases by promoting such topics as religion’s role in the founding of America, Reaganism, the undermining of American sovereignty by the United Nations and why the McCarthyism of the 1950s was not so bad after all.\nIt was suggested that the slave trade be termed the “Atlantic triangular trade”.\nLast year, the board approved a politics textbook that listed Moses as a key influence on the Founding Fathers.\nHow to cover climate change and creationism have also provoked controversy. Last year, McGraw-Hill made changes after a proposed textbook wrongly stated that there was no scientific consensus on the cause of global warming and cited a rightwing think tank that is a prominent climate-change denier .\nIn another example of the kind of understated use of language that upset Dean-Burren, the curriculum standards call for “sectionalism, states’ rights and slavery” to be taught as causes of the civil war – placing slavery third, though it was the central reason.\nKathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, an activist group that monitors the religious right, said in a statement that the group was “encouraged that the publisher is correcting this passage downplaying the history of slavery in the United States.\n“But it’s no accident that this happened in Texas,” the statement added. “We have a textbook adoption process that’s so politicized and so flawed that it’s become almost a punch line for comedians.\n“The truth is that too many elected officials who oversee that process are less interested in accurate, fact-based textbooks than they are in promoting their own political views in our kids’ classrooms.”", "external_links": ["http://www.nationaljournal.com/energy/2014/11/17/Second-Texas-Textbook-Publisher-Drops-Climate-Denial-Entry-Amid-Backlash", "http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2014/11/21/365686593/texas-hits-the-books", "https://www.facebook.com/roni.deanburren/videos/vb.1423354683/10208248919206996/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/21/AR2010052104365.html", "https://instagram.com/p/8QzMZ3krmT/&quot;", "https://instagram.com/p/8QzMZ3krmT/"], "published": "2015-10-06T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:09:57.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
