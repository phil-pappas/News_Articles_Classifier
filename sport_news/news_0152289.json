The Wheat Kings acquired Armour from the Saskatoon Blades on Thursday. (FILE PHOTO) \nIf familiarity with the Brandon Wheat Kings is any indicator of success, the team’s newest left-winger could be a hit. \nGarrett Armour, an 18-year-old Winnipeg product who was acquired from the Saskatoon Blades on Thursday, said he is happy with the opportunity he’s been given in part because he has friends on the team. \n\"Nolan Patrick, I’ve grown up with him since we were seven and he lives probably within five or 10 minutes of me (in Winnipeg),\" Armour said. \"I see that guy lots during the summer. Mark Taraschuk, I know him really well and played against him a lot.\" \nHe also knows Tanner Kaspick and Kale Clague from playing against them. \nThe Wheat Kings sent a conditional 2017 Western Hockey League draft pick to Saskatoon for the chance to give Armour an audition. \nHe played 45 games with the Blades last season, posting one goal, five assists and 60 penalty minutes. The six-foot-two, 212-pound Armour was originally selected by the Edmonton Oil Kings in the seventh round of the 2012 WHL bantam draft. \nWheat Kings head coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon said the Blades have a lot of young players who need ice time, a situation that impacted Armour. \nHe said the winger could potentially be a good addition. \nArmour adds \"depth up front, experience — he’s been in the league for a year — size and strength, good skater,\" McCrimmon said. \"It’s more depth at the forward position. Guys like Garrett, sometimes it’s about fit. We’ll see if there is a fit for him here. I think he has something to offer.\" \nArmour said he had an inkling a deal was in the offing but added it was still a shock when he officially found out. The destination made it all worthwhile. \n\"This was definitely the number one place I would have liked to go,\" Armour said. \nHe said he is a power forward who likes to keep his game simple, getting pucks deep, banging bodies and fighting if required. \n\"Obviously it’s a team that knows how to win,\" Armour said. \"Hopefully I can contribute to that.\" \n<B>AROUND THE WHL:  \nG <B>Nick McBride, 18, has left the Prince Albert Raiders to await a trade. McBride was in a three-way battle with <B>Rylan Parenteau, 19, and <B>Ian Scott, 16, for playing time. He isn’t the only goalie on the move. The Tri-City Americans dealt Winnipeg Jets prospect <B>Josh Morrissey’s younger brother <B>Jake, a day after claiming him from the Kelowna Rockets, to the Blades for a sixth-round pick in 2018 on Wednesday. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:25:32.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
