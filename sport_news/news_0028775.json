The Cougars are 7-0 against FCS opponents under Mendenhall, winning by an average score of 50-9.\nWagner is winless (0-6) this season, having lost by an average score of 33-13. The Seahawks lost 56-16 in their season opener at Rice.\nBut BYU coaches and players insist they’re not taking anything for granted this week.\n“Maybe the fans and you all, the media, you look at records, but I don’t have that luxury because the bottom line is they have everything to gain and we’ve got everything to lose,” said wide receivers coach Guy Holliday. “So we’ve got to come out here and freakin’ play like we play every week, in a frenzy. And hopefully we won’t wait until the fourth quarter to play really well. That’s the key.”\nWhat have coaches been emphasizing this week in practice?\n“They’ve been emphasizing not treating it lightly and to use it to make ourselves better,” said linebacker Fred Warner. “We haven’t let off the gas at all. We’re treating it like a normal week.”\nBYU has beaten FCS foes Eastern Washington, 42-7 (2007); Northern Iowa, 41-17 (2008); Idaho, 42-7 (2011); Weber State, 45-13 (2012); Idaho State, 59-13 (2013); and Savannah State, 64-0 (2014).\nROC’N’ROLL: BYU’s student section, Roar of Cougars (ROC), has been praised by players and coaches for their support and passion at LaVell Edwards Stadium this season.\n“I’ll tell you what. I’ve been fortunate to have played and coached in some pretty big stadiums,” said offensive line coach Garett Tujague. “I would tell you it would be tough to find anybody better than our student section. The ROC gets after it. We feed off their energy and they feed off of ours. It’s special. I’m glad I don’t have to bring an offensive line unit in here and battle the other defense and the ROC. They do an amazing job. It’s a lot of fun and great energy at Edwards Stadium.”\nROCCO?: In the Wagner football release this week, coach Bronco Mendenhall is referred to as “Rocco” Mendenhall.\nIn the same release, Wagner devotes an entire page to BYU basketball assistant coach Quincy Lewis, who is a Wagner alum and Hall-of-Famer.\nLESLIE BACK IN THE NFL: Former BYU wide receiver Jordan Leslie, who spent time with the Minnesota Vikings this season before being cut, signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars Wednesday. The Jaguars are traveling to London this weekend to face the Buffalo Bills.\nEMAIL: jeffc@deseretnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:30:30.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
