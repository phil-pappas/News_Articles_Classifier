You can do all the training in the world, but it’s a different story when you’re in there on the night. \n“Sparring is the closest thing to it but, even then, you have to step it up a level when the actual fight comes around. \n“It was a great atmosphere at the Banks’s last time. It’s a nice little venue, because everyone is on top of you and you really feel the crowd. \n“I’m glad I got the chance to thank all of my supporters, as well, because without them I wouldn’t be able to box. \n“I’ll always try and put a show on for the people that pay their hard earned money to come and watch me fight. I want to give all of them their money’s worth. \n“Of course, it’s about winning but it’s about entertaining, as well.” \nZaber has seen nothing yet to trouble him in the pro game, adding: “I know that once I start climbing up the ladder, I’ll come up against better fighters than me. \n“I’ve got no amateur experience, at all, so they’ll be slicker but they won’t be fight with the same intensity as I do. \n“Naturally, you get nervous when you turn up on the night but I try and use that to my advantage. It keeps my head on the job. More on this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:19:36.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
