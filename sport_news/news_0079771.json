Barrett as his starting quarterback. Nothing against Cardale Jones, but I think Barrett is the bigger threat, both running and passing. \nMeyer has now named Barrett the starter for Saturday night at Rutgers. The coach says J.T. deserves it with how he has played, but I think there's more to it. \nMeyer's biggest opponent this weekend is not Rutgers, but the anti-Ohio State movement. I've watched several so-called experts once again this week pound away at the Buckeyes and say they're not deserving of a top 4 playoff spot. \nInstead they're pushing for a team like Utah. Yes, Utah's unbeaten and has wins over Michigan and Cal. But they're also coming off a game with Arizona State where they trailed in the fourth quarter. One expert said Arizona State is a good team. Really? How good? The Sun Devils are 4-3 with a win over Cal-Poly. Cal-who? That team near the bottom of the Big Sky Conference. Making Arizona State sound better than they are is just an excuse to give Utah more love. \nYou would think a number one ranking, 20 straight wins, and a 28 point blowout of Penn State would be enough, but it's not with the critics of Ohio State. That's why I think this change at quarterback is a case of put up and shut up. The Buckeyes need to put up bigger numbers, to shut up the critics. \nTweet me your thoughts @johnWKYC.
