Geibel scored four goals — all in the first half — and the Arkport Lady Jays stunned the Alfred-Almond Eagles, 4-0, in Wednesday evening's Steuben County Athletic Association girls soccer affair at the Arkport Athletic Fields. \"The girls all came out on the same page and were just ready to play. Sometimes that's tough to do after the emotional Senior Night ceremony,\" Arkport first-year head coach Katie Crowell said. \"It stirs up emotions, not only in the seniors, but the younger players as well. The older girls certainly wanted it, but the juniors and my one sophomore were right there. \"From the get-go, they came out ready to play. When your team is doing all the little things — winning the 50-50 balls, playing aggressively, and things are flowing — you can't help but sit back and smile, and enjoy the moments. That's what the first half was, just a lot of great moments. It was very fun to watch.\" Geibel knocked in the eventual game-winner on an assist from Kristine Partridge with just over four minutes expired in the contest. Approximately seven minutes later, it appeared as though Geibel had struck again, but a referee credited Aly VanScoter with the goal off of a corner-kick try. The official noted the set-piece deflected off of an Alfred-Almond defender and into the back of the net. However, after a short discussion during the halftime intermission between Crowell and the referees, the decision was reversed and Geibel officially went into the book as the goal scorer. With Arkport already leading 2-0, Geibel corralled the rebound on her own shot attempt and bounced it into the back right corner of the net for No. 99. With slightly over 10 minutes to play before the break, Geibel's unassisted goal put her at the 100 mark for her career and gave the Lady Jays an insurmountable halftime cushion. \"She's a selfless leader. She looks for the goal and often finds the back of the net obviously, but a majority of those goals have come from hard work,\" Crowell said. \"There are times when she is too unselfish, she gives it up when she should keep it. She's always looking to set up her teammates and she leads the team in assists. \"It told her at halftime, I know this is something that you've always wanted, but it's never been your focus. It's never overshadowed your play, what the team is trying to achieve and what she is trying to achieve with the team. To me, that's exceptional.\" A-A could only stand by and watch as it's three-game win streak came to an end. \"It's very disappointing. I don't know what to say,\" A-A head coach Jim Lucey lamented after the game. \"There was some confusion as to who was marking Brooke. She was allowed to run wild in the midfield, and you can't have a player such as that running wild in the midfield. She's a really good soccer player. And our kicking game hurts us a little, too. We're not very good kickers of the ball and we need to improve that as a skill across the board — at every level of our program. They've got a lot of girls on their team that can send the ball a long way. Page 2 of 3 - \"That's pretty much how they got their goals tonight. Actually, the ball came in from a long way out and Brooke put it in the net from there. But again, we can't let her run around loose in the midfield. That's the lesson of tonight's game.\" Arkport controlled nearly every facet of the game from an overwhelming 21-5 advantage on the shot chart to a 5-1 differential in the corner-kick column. \"We've been working on shooting more and not giving up good opportunities,\" Crowell said when asked about the relentless pressure applied to the A-A defense and goaltender. \"We want offensive threats from all areas, not just one or two players. They all work hard and they all are very capable of scoring. And, good things happen when you shoot.\" The Eagles' leading scorer Caitlin Cook, who has registered 29 goals this season — fourth in Section V and second in Steuben County behind only Addison's Makenzie Wooldridge, was basically held in check. The senior had just three shots on goal. \"Absolutely. She wasn't able to get the ball as much as she has been in other games,\" Lucey said. \"Part of that's because of the things we weren't able to do in the midfield, and games and be won or lost in the midfield. Because we lost the midfield, we were never able to get the ball up to her at the forward position. We only generated a few attacks on the night. I think we played some decent soccer at times, but they obviously had the better soccer players tonight.\" The defender responsible for containing Cook? VanScoter. \"It wasn't as though Aly had her as a mark all night long, but she has such good field awareness that she constantly knew where she was,\" Crowell said. \"It just happened to be that she was in Aly's area for a majority of the game, and if she went out, we just wanted her to communicate that to her teammates because we didn't need to follow her everywhere. It was a really good match-up between the two of them.\" Mackenzie McDaniel collected four saves in her third straight shutout and sixth of the season. \"When she needed to be there, she was there to make the save,\" Crowell lauded. \"We needed her to be steady tonight, and she was. I also thought the defense did well. It was almost smothering as a group at times. We didn't give up many free looks and that's another thing we've been working hard at. We want our opponents to earn the shots that they get.\" A-A, now 9-4 on the season, looks to get back on track Saturday evening during another SCAA opponent's Senior Night festivities. The opening kick at Campbell-Savona Central School is set for 7 p.m. Page 3 of 3 - \"There's always a positive you can take from any game,\" Lucey explained. \"Hannah Kinnaird played a pretty good game at fullback. Paige Schmidt wasn't too bad either, she had her hands full, but she played pretty well. There are a couple of bright spots here and there — Lindsey Allen was another. She's a freshman and she played center fullback for the better part of the game — after the fourth goal, in fact — and they didn't score over the remainder of the game. That says something about her. \"We beat them 3-0 earlier this year,\" Lucey added when asked about the Panthers. \"Hopefully we can have a similar result over there. They'll be ready to go in their seniors' last game. At this point, we just have to improve and play better.\" The Jays (10-2-1), meanwhile, are off until Tuesday when they'll meet up with the same C-S Panthers in Savona. \"We're playing some very good soccer,\" Crowell said. \"When you get to October, you want to be playing well and hitting your stride going into sectionals. Our biggest thing at this point is to not look back and just keep pushing forward. We've got three games next week and we'll take each one at a time. Then, the postseason will be here before we know it and that's always an exciting time of the year.\" By Derrick Balinsky / Tribune Sports Editor The Evening Tribune By Derrick Balinsky / Tribune Sports Editor Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 10:45 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:57:08.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
