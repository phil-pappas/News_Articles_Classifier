It will stand as the biggest comeback victory in Bronco Mendenhall’s tenure as the Cougars' head coach — even though it nearly became one the biggest lost leads in his career on the same night.\nIt was that crazy.\nThis one had more plots twists than a James Patterson novel. In the end, with the game tied at 38, the Cougars brought banged-up freshman quarterback Tanner Mangum back from the locker room to engineer a 10-play, 75-yard winning touchdown drive to seal the victory, 45-38.\nReally.\nThis kid threw miracle Hail Marys against Nebraska and Boise State and then limped around on the sideline most of the fourth quarter on Saturday — only to walk back on the field with the game on the line and lead a winning, clock-gobbling scoring drive.\n“What a remarkable performance by Tanner Mangum,” said Mendenhall. \"I didn’t think he’d come back and he did. He continues to do some amazing things. We saw what we looked like with him and what we looked like without him.”\nThis is the first time a Mendenhall team has come back from a 14-point deficit in his 11 years.\nMangum looked like Robbie Bosco, who left the 1984 Holiday Bowl game against Michigan and returned to lead BYU to a win. In a game with BYU’s first big-time quarterback from the 1965 WAC championship team, Virgil Carter, carrying the big alumni flag on the field before kickoff, it seemed proper this be a QB kind of night.\nImmediately after the win, Mendenhall didn’t know what Mangum’s status would be. Mangum said he’s fine. The injury that took Mangum out of 16 minutes of playing time and four BYU possessions was a hamstring muscle pull.\nMangum was sensational on this sun-baked Saturday night. So was running back Algie Brown. Mangum completed 24 of 33 passes for 332 yards and three touchdowns. His pass efficiency rating was 189.2.\nBrown, who’d scored just three touchdowns in his Cougar career, finished with 135 yards on 24 carries. He had three touchdowns on the ground and added another touchdown on a 22-yard flare pass reception from Mangum, BYU’s first score of the game.\nBYU’s defense, riddled by injuries and last-minute discipline issues, lost corner Micah Hannemann in the middle of the game and moved safety Kai Nacua to corner and had walk-ons playing strong and free safety. Seasoned corners Michael Shelton and Jordan Preator did not play.\nIt all set the stage for a memorable Mangum finish.\n“I couldn’t stand on the sidelines any longer,” said the freshman.\n“To see our guys come through in the clutch was huge. I didn’t have to do much, they did all the work.”\nIndeed they did. But so did he.\nNobody can discount how big it was that Mangum came back on the field. His linemen blocked harder. His backs ran tougher. His receivers made big plays to keep that final drive alive.\n“This was a team win,” said Mendenhall.\nAnd that was also true. Mendenhall's defense did a decent job handling Eastern Carolina’s change-up QBs in Taysom Hill-clone James Summers, who gave way to pass-happy Blake Kemp. Third-quarter turnovers — a Michael Davis tip pass for a Fred Warner interception and fumble recovery and a Sione Takitaki jump on a fumble — were big.\nFile it in the strange folder: Both BYU and East Carolina had blocked punts that led to immediate touchdowns. Also, in the rare folder, BYU let punter Jonny Linehan fake a punt and run for a first down in the first half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:24:05.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
