The Sharks' Patrick Marleau did so twice.\nQuote: OF THE NIGHT\nâThe positive is we know how hard we have to work. Itâs a game where they worked from beginning to end. We had spots where we were gliding. We canât afford to do that.â\n- Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau on his teamâs performance in defeat.\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT\n- Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf was strong in the faceoff circle with 14 wins in 21 draws but played a largely passive game for the most part. Getzlaf wasnât particularly strong with the puck and finished with a minus-2 rating.\nPLAYER OF THE GAME\n- Apparently the 36-year-old Patrick Marleau still has some game. His days as the Sharksâ captain are long gone but Marleau had a game-high seven shots on goal and the only two goals. He had just 19 last season, his lowest over an 82-game slate since 2007-08.\nANALYSIS\n- Maybe there is something to the Sharks already having one game â\" and one rousing win over the Kings â\" under their belt as Andersen said afterward but the Ducks didnât match San Joseâs tenacity or persistence following an effective first 10 minutes. Both goalies were on but the Sharks didnât allow themselves to get frustrated and stuck to their system. Meanwhile, the Ducks started to scramble too much in the defensive end and allowed Jones to see most of the pucks they fired at him.\nKEY MOMENT\n- The Ducks made Sharks goalie Martin Jones work in the second period, forcing him a few tough stops among his 15 saves. They failed to build on that in the third as they were outshot 17-3. And when Marleau slipped a wraparound shot Frederik Andersenâs pads with 4:50 left, that was essentially that.\nANY NEWS?\n- The experiment of keeping longtime linemates Getzlaf and Perry apart last for 2 Â½ periods. Getzlaf and Perry were together early on but only for a few seconds as Getzlaf was at the end of a long shift. Boudreau put the two back together with Carl Hagelin in the third, looking to generate offense with the Ducks down a goal.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-anaheimducks.logo.jpg.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-anaheimducks.logo.jpg.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:33:08.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
