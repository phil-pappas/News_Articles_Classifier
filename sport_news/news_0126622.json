(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nAllen Park — Lions linebacker DeAndre Levy will undergo hip surgery in the near future, coach Jim Caldwell announced Wednesday.\nThe team has not yet decided whether Levy needs to go on season-ending injured reserve, but he’ll surely miss a significant number of games following the operation.\nLevy has been one of the Lions’ defensive stars the past couple seasons and signed a four-year, $33.8 million extension in August. He made his season debut in Sunday’s loss to the Cardinals, but exited late in the second quarter and did not return. The hip injury held Levy out of practice for more than a month, starting in late August.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:22:32.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
