We put up some big numbers together. So I'm just looking forward to everyone working together and see what we can do.\"\nGlenn, acquired from Saskatchewan for a fifth round draft pick, practised with his new teammates for the first time.\nKevin Glenn talked with the media earlier today. VIDEO -> http://t.co/esymi5hXhk #AlsMTL\n— #AlsMTL (@MTLAlouettes) October 15, 2015 Coach and general manager Jim Popp hopes to have him ready to start a home game Sunday against Hamilton.\n\"We'll do everything we can to get him on the field,\" said Popp. \"He feels comfortable and the meetings have gone great.\n\"He spent a lot of time (Wednesday) after he arrived, to about eight o'clock at night. Then he was back at 6:30 this morning to get back at it. He feels he can get it accomplished.\"\nThe Alouettes were desperate for a starting quarterback after rookie Rakeem Cato suffered a concussion in a 25-17 loss to Toronto on Monday. They had already lost starter Jonathan Crompton to a second injury this season, and didn't feel Anthony Boone, Tanner Marsh or Brandon Bridge were ready to step in.\nMontreal (5-9) needs to start winning games to challenge for a playoff spot with four games left in the regular season.\n\"Nothing worries me,\" said Glenn, in his 15th CFL season. \"It's just learning, like going to school.\n\"Today was a good day. We did some good things.\"\n''I want to come in and do my part. I want to do whatever I need to do to help the team.'' — @qterback5 #AlsMTL\n— #AlsMTL (@MTLAlouettes) October 14, 2015 ''It's exciting. This a very very good team. I'm glad to be here… I even know some of the guys already!'' — @qterback5 #AlsMTL\n— #AlsMTL (@MTLAlouettes) October 14, 2015 As for Lewis calling him his favourite quarterback, Glenn laughed and said: \"He's silly. And because he'll get mad if I don't say it, yes he is my favourite receiver.\"\nIt should help that he has a veteran receiving corps with Lewis, S.J. Green, Fred Stamps and Samuel Giguere.\n\"It can only help us,\" Green said of Glenn's arrival. \"We've been young at that position pretty much all year.\n\"Not to take anything from the guys who have played quarterback this year, but you can't replace experience. That's something Kevin has a lot of.\"\nThe Alouettes, who have beaten Hamilton in both of their meetings this season, may also have cornerback Mitchell White and defensive end Aaron Lavarius back from injuries this week.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Ken Taylor, Canadian envoy who hid Americans in residence during Iran hostage crisis, dies\n0\nRangers view Bautista's bat flip as a sign of disrespect\n0\nThe truth about Trudeau\n0\nMaple Leafs cheer on Blue Jays\n0\nNew Rob Ford tell-all details domestic fight\n0\nKen Taylor, Canadian envoy who hid Americans in residence during Iran hostage crisis, dies\n0\n'Mini Bautista' helps Blue Jays' Jose Bautista hit winning home run\n0\nTories using sex-ed as a wedge issue federally: Wynne\n0\nMom charged in teen's church beating death was too 'meek and timid' to stop it: Lawyer\n0\nB.C. man found guilty in murder of teenaged girlfriend\n0\nAndrea Christidis remembered\nWhitby Crash\nNorth Korean Yeonmi Park's View of Canadian Freedoms\nPredictions for the Jays in ALDS\nBlue Jays playoff excitement unprecedented\nMore from Football Texas man charged with murder in shooting after Cowboys game 0\nCowboys' Brandon Weeden thrown for a loss 0\nEskimos says B.C.
