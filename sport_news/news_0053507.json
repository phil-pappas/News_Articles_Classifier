WEXLER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Curtis Granderson bouncing up after stealing third base in the third inning. He earlier stole second after a walk and wound up scoring on Yoenis Cespedes’ single. NEW YORK – The ball soared off Chris Coghlan’s bat, carrying out to right field. Curtis Granderson retreated, leapt, and stuck his glove above the wall to rob Coghlan of a home run. \nThe Citi Field crowd erupted. Noah Syndergaard pointed toward Granderson in appreciation. And Coghlan had a stunned look of disbelief while returning to the Cubs’ dugout.\n\"It was huge,\" manager Terry Collins said. \"It was a great catch by Grandy.\"\nIt was a stellar play by Granderson, though not his only contribution to the Mets’ 4-1 victory over the Cubs in Game 2 of the NLCS on Sunday night. The right fielder was a factor in the field, at the plate and on the base paths.\n\"It’s great, especially considering that was the first ball I got this whole series,\" Granderson said. \"To catch one like that, that it was a meaningful one like that to keep a run off the board. Definitely a big thing for us.\"\nGranderson led off the bottom of the first with a single off Cubs starter Jake Arrieta, igniting the offense. He scored on David Wright’s double to center field to give New York the early lead.\nThen in the third, Granderson displayed his speed. He led off the inning with a walk, stole second and third, and scored on Yoenis Cespedes’ single.\n\"[Stealing] was one of the things that we had discussed prior to the game,\" Granderson said. \"If the opportunity presented itself, let’s see. But you obviously don’t want [to make] outs there.\"\nAt the top of the lineup, Granderson has come up big throughout the postseason. The 34-year-old is hitting .375 with seven RBI. \nYet his production has been a continuation of what he did during the regular season, when he hit .259 with 26 home runs and 70 RBI. Granderson hit .278 in the second half. \nHe was a name Collins could write into the lineup consistently, as he played in 157 games. \nBut for Collins, Granderson’s presence in the clubhouse has been just as important as what he’s done on the field. He’s the type of player Collins wants his younger stars to emulate. \n\"I tell all the young guys that come up here, ‘If you handle the game like Curtis Granderson does because you’re talented, you’re going to be successful,’ because he never has a bad day,\" Collins said before the game. \nThe Mets signed Granderson before the 2014 season, hoping he could deliver these types of performances. Granderson said when he signed, he believed the Mets were close to reaching a playoff run.\nWith a collection of such talented, young arms, it was only a matter of time.\nIn only his second season with the organization, New York now is thriving in a deep postseason run. \nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:37.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
