By then, left tackle Jason Peters was out of the game with a quadriceps strain and right tackle Lane Johnson was battling through a medial collateral ligament strain in his left knee that sidelined him briefly. \nThe Eagles made just four first downs in the first half, which allowed Washington to go into the break with a 13-0 lead. Though they produced three second-half touchdowns, those scores weren't enough to overcome the egregious ineptitude they displayed in the first 30 minutes. \nThis also was the fourth time in as many games that the Eagles were clueless offensively for at least one half. \n\"I wish I knew how to explain it,\" Bradford said, \"because then we would get it fixed. It seems to be the story of these first couple games. It's almost like we are two completely different offenses, and once we get it going, we are pretty good. \n\"But for some reason, there are times when we just struggle to get it going.\" \nCall that last sentence the understatement of the century. \nNothing went right for the Eagles in the first half. Even after it looked they had gained some momentum back when Bradford connected with rookie Nelson Agholor on a 45-yard, play-action pass, they gave it back on the next play when a botched reverse ended in a lost fumble. \nOn their next series, the Eagles edged closer to the end zone and still came away with no points, thanks to an illegal formation penalty on Agholor that nullified an 11-yard touchdown pass to Zach Ertz, and the missed field goal by Sturgis. \nThe Redskins had jumped ahead by starting the game with a 13-play field-goal drive. They added to it later in the first quarter by putting together a 10-play drive for another field goal following a three-and-out by the Eagles that took just 1:20 off the clock. \nIn the second quarter, a 17-yard pass interference penalty in the end zone on rookie cornerback Eric Rowe, who had been inserted after Byron Maxwell left with a quadriceps injury on the first series, set up a Redskins touchdown, which came when Cousins recovered his fumbled snap and still plowed forward 2 yards for the score. \nThe second half was a different story, however, as the Eagles opened with the ball and converted two third downs on their way to a 62-yard touchdown pass from Bradford to Riley Cooper. \nTheir momentum wasn't interrupted by Sturgis missing the ensuing extra point either. \nAfter their defense forced a three-and-out, Bradford again went deep with success, this time finding Jordan Matthews for a 30-yard gain. And because Washington committed a personal foul on the play, it set the Eagles up with a first down at the Washington 13. \nThree plays later, on a crucial third-down play, Bradford escaped from a collapsed pocket and hurled a 10-yard scoring pass to Brent Celek that set up a tie when Sturgis converted the extra point. \nThe deep completions by Bradford and the Eagles on this day represented a breakthrough. Until they faced Washington, Bradford hadn't completed a pass thrown 20 yards or more beyond the scrimmage all season. Heck, until Sunday, he had barely tried. \nLess than five minutes later, the Redskins were back on top when Dustin Hopkins kicked a 33-yard field goal. \nBut the Eagles finally gained a lead early in the fourth quarter as Bradford found Miles Austin open for a 39-yard touchdown pass. \nFrom that point, it became a war of attrition, with the Redskins being a little more equipped to win the marathon based on how the first three quarters unfolded. \nThey began the decisive touchdown drive with 6:05 remaining and finished with a stifling 41:08 to 18:42 advantage in time of possession. \n\"We didn't sustain anything in the first half offensively,\" Eagles coach Chip Kelly said. \"And that's what we talk about all the time. In the second half, we protected Sam better and gave him an opportunity to feel the football, and you saw what he could do. … We didn't do a good job in the first half of protecting Sam, so we couldn't convert third downs in the first half.\" \nIn the end, it caught up to a defense that was playing shorthanded at the start — safety Chris Maragos, linebacker Kiko Alonso and defensive ends Cedric Thornton and Taylor Hart were injury scratches — then weakened more when linebacker Mychal Kendricks (hamstring) and cornerback Byron Maxwell (quad) were knocked out of the game for good in the first half. \n\"We just didn't make enough plays out there today,\" defensive end Fletcher Cox said. \"That's what it came down to. Pretty simple.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:05:14.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
