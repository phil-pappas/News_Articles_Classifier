I'm proud of myself to make it happen because these conditions were not easy at all.\"\nThe victory gave the 30-year-old Berdych his first ATP title since last year's Stockholm Open. He has also reached three other finals this year, at the Qatar Open, the Rotterdam Open and the Monte Carlo Masters, but lost them all.\nHe made a strong start against Garcia-Lopez, racing into a 5-2 lead before play was halted for 45 minutes due to a downpour.\nWhen the players returned Berdych closed out the opening set but fell 3-1 behind in the second.\nHe managed to recover and force a tiebreak but had to save a set point before sealing victory.\n\"It was another challenge to finally get the trophy,\" said Berdych. \"The tiebreak was really up and down but I think my experience was decisive.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:24:58.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
