(Brad Horrigan) Desmond Conner Contact Reporter Poor marks for UConn football in loss to South Florida \nEAST HARTFORD — Some of the players wearing UConn uniforms Saturday knew what the legacy of Jasper Howard was all about: hard work and dedication. \nSome who hold Jazz deep in their hearts didn't represent him or themselves well in a 28-20 homecoming game loss at Rentschler Field Saturday. \nHoward, a cornerback, was killed on campus on homecoming weekend in 2009. \nLast year a memorial was dedicated in Howard's honor and the majority of this current team was around for the ceremony. The Huskies proceeded to beat the defending conference champions, Central Florida, riding a wave of emotion at the Rent. \nHomecoming weekend, with respect to many who follow the football program, no matter who the coach is, who the players are, is going to be a time of reflection but it is also a time that fans want to see the home team win. (PAUL DOYLE) \nSaturday was one of those times coning off a resounding win at Central Florida on Oct. 10. \nThe Huskies on Saturday looked nothing like the team that destroyed the Knights 40-13 and some of the play-calling, especially in short-yardage situations was questionable. The Huskies already have a problem executing consistently in critical situations and it was compounded Saturday with head-scratching decisions, in the red zone even. Couple that with porous defensive play and you have a recipe for, well, what happened on the field Saturday. \nThe Huskies were facing what appeared to be a slate of winnable games after the UCF win — one of them being South Florida. (Jeff Jacobs) \nAll bets are off now and the Huskies are off to Cincinnati on Saturday, where they have a hard time winning. They dashed their own opportunity to go into Nippert Stadium with some momentum. \nHere's the Huskies report card off the loss to South Florida before a raucous crowd of 31,719 and packed student section by the way. \nSpecial Teams \nArkeel Newsome was special again with 89 of his 221 yards coming on three kickoff returns but Jazzmar Clax fumbled one Newsome was fortunate to get back with the Huskies down 14-10 in the third quarter. Brian Lemelle took a punt back six yards but he also let the next one go and rolled 68 yards to the UConn 16 in the first quarter — after punter Justin Wain (four punts, 32.8 average) bottled the Bulls up at their own 18 with a nice 27-yard pooch punt. Goodbye field position for an offense that needs as much help as it can get. Wain was back out to punt five plays later. Bobby Puyol missed a 44-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, his first of the season hit the post and bounced out. D'Erne Johnson got off a 34-yard kickoff return and he had a 27-yarder out of the end zone the Bulls eventually turned into a touchdown and a 14-10 lead in the third quarter. C \nOffense \nLine: It faced a lot of speed rushing, a common third-down theme against them now, and it couldn't open holes on critical short yardage situations. Again, it is understood all 11 have to work in unison for a play to have success but it starts with the offensive line and there have just been too many times where it hasn't held up its end of the bargain. The leading rusher was quarterback Bryant Shirreffs (19 carries, 100 yards, one TD) who was also sacked five times - again. D \nQuarterback \nShirreffs also completed 28 of 41 for 365 yards and another TD, becoming the first quarterback in school history to rush for over 100 yards and throw for over 300 in the same game. It was a nice effort by Shirreffs but his decision not to follow the plan of taking a quick shot in the end zone with eight seconds left in the half cost the Huskies points. There are still some clock management issues but that's not all on Shirreffs. B \nRunning back: Not sure what's going on here but Newsome (7 for 58) needs help. He hasn't been getting it from Ron Johnson (6 for 5). On some of the short yardage situations the Huskies came up short on, critical situations. Where was Max DeLorenzo? He's been in the games for mop-up duty lately. What's up with that? Also, the quarterback really shouldn't be the leading rusher. C \nReceiver/tight end \nCareer day for Noel Thomas (7 for 94) and tight ends Tommy Myers (3 for 33) and Alec Bloom (5 for 97) all are appropriate options in short yardage, critical situations. Tyraiq Beals had a 27-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. The Huskies could have benefited from getting him the ball a little more. Two catches isn't enough for him. Newsome had eight receptions for 74 yards, too. B \nDefense \nLine: Started out strong but didn't sustain it. Bulls quarterback Quinton Flowers got outside for 15-yard touchdown. Marlon Mack got outside for a 59-yard run that keyed a USF TD. And Mack went on to too the 100-yard rushing mark by 13 yards and Flowers (15 for 98) almost did it too. C minus \nLinebackers: One too many missed tackles in here and this is supposed to be the surefire level for that stuff. Graham Stewart led the group with eight tackles but he like others missed tackles, too. C minus \nSecondary: Rodney Adams (three touchdowns) was a one-man band against the Huskies' secondary, which turned in its worst effort, in total, on the season. They were beaten for explosive plays, the whole D was, on the ground but in the air, too for this group.
