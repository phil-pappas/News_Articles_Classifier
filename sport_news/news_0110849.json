More contenders are expected. \nPlatini, who helped force Champagne's FIFA exit in 2010, is unlikely to be accepted as a candidate. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:37:12.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
