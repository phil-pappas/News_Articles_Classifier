They had been outscored by 43 points in third quarters so far this season. Cousins hadn’t thrown more than one touchdown pass in any game this season. \nAt halftime, coach Jay Gruden — who had called the matchup against Tampa Bay as a \"code red\" situation — lit into his players. \nSomething finally clicked. Cousins completed three second-half touchdown passes, including the go-ahead score to Jordan Reed with 24 seconds left, as Washington won, 31-30, for the largest comeback in franchise history. \n\"Everybody was pretty upset.
