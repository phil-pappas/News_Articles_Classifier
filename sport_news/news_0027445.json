(Photo: Jason Bean/RGJ) \nWolf Pack defensive end Lenny Jones has had plenty of chances to make excuses this season. \nAnd in years past, Jones would have grabbed those excuses and used them. \nBut not this season, not his senior year, not with so much on the line for himself and his team. \n“I think I would have built in excuses for myself,” Jones said of the adversity he’s faced this season. \nJones, the team’s 6-foot-3, 270-pound captain, missed almost all of fall camp with an illness that ripped through the team. He lost plenty of weight and time on the field. He lost something more important, a cousin, one week into the season and went home to the Bay Area to bury him. A day after the funereal, Jones caught another virus, this one leading to an IV the day of Nevada’s game against Arizona. What's happened to Wolf Pack offense? \nAdversity aplenty for Jones in 2015, but production aplenty as well. \nJones’ four sacks lead the Mountain West. He’s added 17 tackles, a fumble recovery and three pass breakups and has moved to seventh on Nevada’s career sacks list. While the Wolf Pack’s season has gotten off to a rocky start, a 2-3 record with an upset loss to rival UNLV last week, Jones has been a rock. \n“I’ve been very happy with him,” coach Brian Polian said. “Very happy with his leadership. Very happy with the consistency and the ability to not let the distractions in terms of injuries and the distractions off the field affect him. When it’s going good, Lenny’s been great. His problems in the past have been when the distractions kick in, he’d have a difficult time managing that. This year, he’s been fantastic.” \nJones’ impact has been especially important given Nevada’s lack of senior leadership. The Wolf Pack’s 12 seniors are the eighth fewest in the FBS, meaning every senior at Nevada has to leave a positive imprint. \n“We’re not a veteran team,” Polian said. “Our seniors that play and contribute, they can’t take a day off in terms of leadership because there aren’t enough of them. Lenny’s been steady and consistent.” \nHe’s also been team-oriented, which is a change for Jones, who earned a reputation as a me-first guy and rubbed coaches and played wrong during the early part of his Nevada career. Jones’ mentality change came in the middle of last season, his position coach Bill Teerlinck said, and he’s been even better this year. He’s welcomed in younger players and become a key source of their improvement. \n“He’s finally filling out his potential, growing and maturing,” Teerlinck said. “He knows more about football than ever before. That’s the key with any player. He knows football, which allows him to make plays. And I like how he helps everybody else. He helps the young guys. We’re playing a bunch of young guys in the second group and he helps them and when they make plays he’s just as excited for them as he would be if he made the play. He’s totally bought in. He’s team-oriented, not me-oriented.” \nProof of that came before the Arizona game when Jones didn’t start because he missed a Wednesday practice to go to his cousin’s funereal and then missed Thursday and Friday practice with a virus. Jones gave his backup, Malik Reed, a pep talk prior to the game and took an IV to get on the field, too. \n“I don’t know what I had,” Jones said. “I didn’t feel good all the way up until game day. (Teammate Rykeem Yates) told me, ‘Nothing else matters right now. How you feel right now and what you’re going through, save that until after the game. Suck it up and do what you have to do.’ I just wanted to play.” \nPolian called Jones’ play against Arizona “heroic” and he’s been at that level nearly every game out. He had two sacks in the loss to UNLV, while nearly grabbing a third, and added a crucial pass breakup to get Nevada the ball two plays before the Rebels’ game-turning interception returned for a touchdown. \nWith Nevada trying to rebound from its loss to UNLV, the team has leaned on Jones to bring his trademark energy, enthusiasm and positivity. Jones’ motto this season is no excuses, both for the team as it chases its first Mountain West title and for himself as he chases his dream to play in the NFL. \n“Most people who play college football want to play in the NFL,” Jones said. “The chances of it are slim. I don’t have any more years. Last year, I knew in the back of my head I had my senior year. I don’t have any more years to make it up. That’s my dream and if I want to accomplish it I can’t have any excuses.” Murray's MW rankings: Big slip for Pack \nAnd while Jones has displayed a team-first mentality that his coaches have applauded, he still has plenty of individual goals. No. 1 on that list is to set the Wolf Pack’s all-time sacks record. Jones’ 17 rank seventh in program history. He’s two away from moving into the top five and 14 short of the mark held by Jorge Cordova, who had 31 from 2000-03. It’s a long shot Jones gets there, but that’s the target. \n“I want that record,” Jones said. “Coming into the season, I needed 16. I need 12 more. That’s about two a game. I want the record. I’ll let it be known that I want it. Am I going to get it? That’s up to me.” \nBut Jones is quick to point out the individual goals rank behind the team goals. Before the season, Jones gave a speech to his team. It was all about the unity required in Nevada’s quest for a MW title. \n“There are 12 teams in our conference but only one will be the champion,” Jones said. “Not everybody on our team is going to step on the field and play. Some guys are redshirting. Some guys won’t see the field. But if we win a championship everybody gets a ring, everybody is a champion. That’s one thing we can do as a team that nobody would be excluded from. That’s one thing I want for me and my teammates.” \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
