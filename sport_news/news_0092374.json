Even so, during the campaign season authorities arrested 113 people for electoral crimes, including 26 candidates. \nOne of those jailed contenders, Jhon Jairo Torres — who is known as ‘Jhon Underpants’ for his chain of lingerie stores — won the mayor’s post of Yopal. The government will have to put a temporary mayor in place until Torres is either convicted or absolved of allegations that he built a large housing development without permits. \nPeñalosa is well known internationally for being an urbanization guru, and is credited with building Bogotá’s Transmilenio mass transit system during his tenure. Mobility has become one of the key concerns for this traffic-clogged city of 8 million. \nThe election also brings an end to a 12-year-run of left-wing politicians in Bogotá. \nOn Sunday, Mayor Gustavo Petro, a former M-19 guerrilla, congratulated Peñalosa for his victory and said he would work toward a smooth transition. \nIn his victory speech, Peñalosa promised to run an inclusive administration and said he would “urgently” address the issues of mobility, safety and health. \n“But we’re also going to build the shared dream,” he said, “that this is a city for us, our children and our grandchildren.” Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:54:28.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
