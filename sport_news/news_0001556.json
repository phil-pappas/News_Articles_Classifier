The visitors had nothing to play for, as they sit in the bottom of the standings, but Emmanuel Gigliotti and the home team could vault into the top half of the standings with positive results in the final three games of the season.Looks like another beautiful night in China for a soccer match -- Fernando Conceicao tests the visitors keeper early on, and after a moment of uncertainty, the goalie holds on.Chongqing would press in the 22nd minute, and get a penalty when Liu Yu is brought down in the area. The referee points straight to the spot. It's an obvious foul from the Shanghai defender.Gigliotti then steps up from the spot to make it 1-0 for Lifan. The Argentine striker has scored 15 goals so far this campaign.In the 32nd minute, the hosts get out on the counterattack. After a clever back heel, Conceicao is sent clear, and completes the play with a cool finish. The hosts hold on for a 2-0 victory, while Shenxin remain rooted to the bottom of the standings.So Guangzhou Evergrande are first, with a four-point cushion over SIPG. Luiz Felipe Scolari's team have two games left to clinch a fifth straight league title. Beijing Guoan are third with 56 points, one ahead of Shandong Luneng. The top three qualify for the AFC Champions League next season. Chongqing's victory helps them climb to eighth.
