(KTTC) - He has over 1,300 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. He's thrown for almost 500 passing yards and 4 more touchdowns. He's even made 57 tackles on defense and four interceptions. Is there anything Ryan Wolfe can't do? \n\"Ryan Wolfe doesn't tie his shoes,\" head coach Tim Klingbeil explained. \"I don't know if he doesn't know how, he just doesn't tie them.\" \n\"Yeah I'm not very good at tying my shoes,\" Wolfe laughed. \"Coach just tapes them up for me.\" \nFair enough, but once those shoes are taped, the senior stand out for the Falcons has triumphed on the football field. Last week in the first round of the Section 1A playoffs, Wolfe finished with 293 yards rushing and three touchdowns, helping his team defeat Hayfield and win their first playoff game since 1986. \n\"It's something that this community has been waiting for for a very long time and we're glad that we could get it done,\" Wolfe said. \"We play so much better when we're having fun and not worrying about anything so that was the biggest thing.\" \nHe's having fun alright. Back on October 2, Wolfe ran for 309 yards and three touchdowns against Southland and he threw a touchdown pass as well. On a team with only four seniors, coach Klingbeil says the leadership and versatility from a player like Wolfe is irreplaceable. \n\"If you put him in a lineman number, he'd be a good lineman,\" Klingbeil said. \"I think we if we had twenty of him we'd be in the state championship. I can't find a flaw.\" \nExcept for maybe tying his shoes.
