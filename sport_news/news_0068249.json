Hardy played only one game for the Panthers in 2014 and spent the rest of the year on the commissioner's exempt list with full pay. He signed with the Cowboys as a free agent earlier this year. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:48:58.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
