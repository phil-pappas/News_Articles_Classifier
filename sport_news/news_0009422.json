(Las Vegas Review-Journal file photo) Mark AndersonLas Vegas Review-Journal \nLas Vegan Kayli Barker has been selected to participate in NASCAR's Drive for Diversity combine on Oct. 19 to 21 at Hampton, Va. \nBarker, 18, is the winningest female driver ever at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway Bullring, having recorded 15 career victories. She finished fifth in the NASCAR Super Late Models standings this season. \nBy going to the combine, the UNLV freshman will hope to earn a spot in the Drive for Diversity program. Another Las Vegan, Jay Beasley, has competed in that program the past two years. \n\"I'm thrilled, especially since this is something new and different,\" Barker said in a release. \"I finally got chosen, so it's a nice little relief. When I first looked at the (acceptance) email, I thought it was probably just saying, 'Try again next year.' But I was like, 'Oh wow, I got picked!' I was in shock.\" Comment section guidelines The below comment section contains thoughts and opinions from users that in no way represent the views of the Las Vegas Review-Journal or GateHouse Media.
