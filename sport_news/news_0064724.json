They're big, they're physical and strong and they love to play ball.\" \nMcClellan (4-2, 2-1 5-A Central) rushed for 438 yards and allowed Mills 177 yards of total offense. \nStrong scored on runs of 60 and 65 yards. \nMcClellan's defense scored the game's first points when Mills (1-4, 0-2) bobbled its first snap from center and junior defensive end Raoshun Young ran it in from 41 yards for a f6-0 lead.. \nA two-point conversion made it 8-0, and the Crimson Lions recovered an onside kick to set up their next score, a 37-yard run by quarterback Dalvion Childs with 10:11 left in the first quarter. \nChilds, who split time at quarterback with Bennie Kemp, carried 11 times for 91 yards and 4 rushing touchdowns. \nChilds completed 5 of 7 passes for 37 yards. Kemp did attempt a pass but carried 7 times for 84 yards and a 4-yard run. \nMills trailed 24-0 late in the first quarter before driving 62 yards in four minutes and scoring on quarterback Jereme Allen's 17-yard run. The two-point conversion put the score at 24-8 with 1:38 remaining in the quarter. \nA 4-yard touchdown run from Childs made it 32-8 lead, but the Comets countered with a 28-yard touchdown run from fullback Branden Bunting just seconds into the second quarter. \nBunting finished the game 42 yards on eight carries. Allen had 13 carries for 54 yards. \nMcClellan led 46-16 at halftime. \nSports on 10/10/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:07:37.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
