For Riverheads, it was a chance to go to a fifth set for just the second time this year. \nAnd this time around, it worked out well as the Gladiators rallied for a 26-28, 25-22, 22-25, 25-15 and 15-10 victory over Buffalo Gap. \nThe previous five-setter for Riverheads was a loss to Luray, the only setback in a 14-1 season to this point. All the other Gladiator matches have gone four games or less before the marathon with the Bison. \n“It’s key for them to practice their fight,” said Ruth Thompson, head coach for the Red Pride. “It’s definitely important with playoff time coming in.” \nOn the other side, the Bison showed they can stay with the elite teams in the area as they lost for just the first time in the last five matches. Getting healthy has helped Gap become much more of a factor. \n“We’ve had Emily (Hanger) and Abby (Flint) back for about three or four games, healthy and ready to go,” said Buffalo Gap head coach Elizabeth Ashby. “I think it is a confidence booster, knowing that we did what we did tonight.” \nThe first three sets were each up for grabs. The score was tied 29 times and the lead changed 18 more, with the Bison taking the first and third games to go up 2-1. \nThings fell apart for Gap in the fourth set and Riverheads took advantage. Nine service points, including a pair of aces from Blake Bartley, helped the Gladiators break open a 4-4 tie and force the final set. Cassidey Chrisman had four kills and a block in Game 4, while Gap made numerous mistakes. \n“It was just a matter of getting that first pass up on the serve,” said Ashby of the struggles. “If we got it up on the serve, we came right back and couldn’t get it up on the hit.” \nAn Emily Hanger block gave Buffalo Gap a brief 4-3 lead in the final set. Riverheads responded with the next six points to take control and held on for the win. Chrisman finished things off with her 17th kill of the match. \nIn the victory, Bartley had 11 kills, Kelly Coffey accounted for eight and Emma Casto and McKenze Taylor added seven each. On defense, Madison Cash accumulated 30 digs, while Coffey picked up 26 assists as setter. \n“One thing I love about my girls is that they always believe that they can win,” said Thompson. “They are going to fight and get every last ball.” \nHanger had a huge night for the Bison in the loss, picking up 13 kills, six blocks and six service aces. Flint contributed 10 kills, while Katie Foster and Sierra Clifton had seven a piece. Setter Camille Ashby had 37 assists for Buffalo Gap, which is now 7-6 on the year.
