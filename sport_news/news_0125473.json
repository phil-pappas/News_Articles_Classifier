Barry Chin / The Boston Globe There are about two dozen women sitting in cells at Framingham state prison. Their only crime? Addiction.\nThe women desperately need treatment for their drug addictions—so much so that a judge ordered it for them involuntarily after a family member, doctor or police officer petitioned for it.\nRelated Links Truth in death: Shedding the stigma of heroin addiction in obituaries Does anyone running for president really care about the heroin crisis? A baby, a needle, a new drug war Under the law—called section 35—addicts can be sent to detox, then rehab, for up to 90 days. And more than 3,000 people between July 2014 and July 2015 have done that, according to the Department of Public Health.\nBut some of those women aren’t given a bed in a licensed treatment facility. They’re given a uniform and a jail cell, because there’s not enough room at regular rehabs.\nThe practice has been in place for nearly 30 years, but could soon end.\nAmong the proposals in Gov. Charlie Baker’s substance abuse legislation released Thursday is a plan to stop to sending women to prison for addiction. Treatment beds will be expanded in secure facilities similar to what exists now at the Women’s Addiction Treatment Center in New Bedford, where the fortunate women who are civilly committed go if there’s enough room.\n“If you are a woman in Massachusetts and you’re an addict and you are involuntarily committed, you will be sent to Framingham and you will not receive treatment,” Baker said on WGBH’s Boston Public Radio Thursday.\nAlready, a lawsuit was filed in June 2014 by the American Civil Liberties Union to stop the placement of women in prison.\nSince the class-action suit was filed on behalf of eight women, the prison placement has continued; in September, according to the ACLU, there were between 23 and 29 women who were at Framingham on any given day.\nWhile there, the addicted women can’t go to Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. They’re banned from the library and the chapel like regular prisoners who have been convicted of a crime. (The Baker administration denies those claims in its suit response, though Baker said Thursday that the women in prison aren’t receiving treatment.)\n“They’re treated like prisoners, except when they’re treated worse than prisoners,” said Jessie Rossman, staff attorney for the ACLU.\nMeanwhile, at the Women’s Addiction Treatment Center, which has about 90 beds, women are given group counseling, trauma awareness, coping skills and planning for release.\n“To take away an individual's civil liberties, to treat them like a prisoner when they have not been convicted of any crime, and to not provide them the treatment that is the underlying purpose of the statute itself doesn’t make sense,” Rossman said. “It’s unlawful and ineffective. It’s more harmful.”\nRossman said Thursday that the ACLU believes that Baker is sincere in the hope to stop sending women to prison.\n“But at this moment, there are women in MCI Framingham under Section 35 who have not been convicted of any crime and are not receiving any treatment,” she said. “And as things stand, civilly committed women will continue to be imprisoned at Framingham without any treatment while the legislature considers these various proposals.”\nUntil women are no longer sent to prison for addiction, the suit will continue.\nRead the ACLU’s lawsuit:\nACLU civil commitment suit\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Dietary supplements hospitalize thousands yearly, study says 10.15.15 | 6:31 PM Despite court order, St. Frances parishioners will continue 11-year church vigil 10.15.15 | 5:48 PM Sending women to prison for addiction could end under Mass. governor’s plan 10.15.15 | 5:09 PM Boston is getting a wax museum 10.15.15 | 5:08 PM Newton bear believed to be dead 10.15.15 | 4:27 PM After Confederate flag battle, South Carolina senator questions Mass. banner 10.15.15 | 3:45 PM Hiker reported missing in New Hampshire 10.15.15 | 3:03 PM At Head of the Charles, boats worth $50,000 try not to crash 10.15.15 | 1:56 PM Haverhill police arrest 19 people, recover 15 guns in investigation with feds 10.15.15 | 1:44 PM Teen charged with murdering teacher will be evaluated at state hospital; trial on hold 10.15.15 | 12:06 PM Mass.’s unemployment rate dropped in September 10.15.15 | 11:47 AM Big Dig springs big leaks 10.15.15 | 9:27 AM After nearly 11 years, St. Frances parishioners ordered to leave church 10.15.15 | 8:59 AM Delays on Mass Pike inside Prudential Tunnel 10.15.15 | 8:58 AM Those upside-down billboards are being turned around 10.15.15 | 8:57 AM Marco Rubio used Mike Dukakis to diss Democrats 10.15.15 | 8:41 AM Google is bringing its ‘Street View’ to the Charles 10.15.15 | 8:36 AM Report: Feds questioning legality of daily fantasy sports 10.15.15 | 7:38 AM BU creates task force to address faculty diversity 10.15.15 | 5:59 AM Here’s Don Orsillo’s first day with the San Diego Padres 10.14.15 | 10:34 PM The Lincoln Chafee frog scandal that undermines his one strong debate moment 10.14.15 | 10:09 PM Man convicted of killing South Boston grandmother sentenced to life without parole 10.14.15 | 9:52 PM Harvard student sets new Guinness record for standing on a workout ball 10.14.15 | 9:42 PM Caramel apples are breeding ground for listeria, researchers say 10.14.15 | 7:16 PM Sen.
