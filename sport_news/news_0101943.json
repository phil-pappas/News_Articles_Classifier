It was just when it got down to the end of the game, during crucial points, we did not finish and execute.” \nSenior running back C.J. Prosise carried the ball 19 times for 143 yards and two touchdowns on the night. \nIn the air, Notre Dame’s sophomore quarterback Deshone Kizer completed 15 of 24 passes on his way to throwing for 227 yards and two touchdowns. \nJunior wide receiver Will Fuller was on the other end of a 75-yard touchdown pass from Kizer on the Irish’s first play from scrimmage. Fuller caught only three passes on the night but was still able to go off for 131 yards receiving. \n“C.J. and Fuller, they are tremendous football players,” Helton said. “They did a great job of winning their one-on-one matchups, especially in the deep ball.” \nFuller’s touchdown reception quickly answered USC’s seven points on its first drive of the game, which came on a three-yard rush by Kessler. \nComing off one of the worst performances of his career, Kessler thew for 365 yards and two touchdowns on 30-of-46 passing but threw two timely interceptions that hurt USC in the fourth quarter. \n“Those turnovers late were crucial, especially when you play a good football team like that,” Kessler said. \nAfter trailing 24-10 in the second quarter, the Trojans responded with two consecutive scoring drives to tie the game at 24. \nHelton brought out a play from the trick book when he dialed up a reverse pass that had former quarterback and redshirt freshman wide receiver Jalen Greene throwing a 75-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who caught for 139 yards on six receptions. \nSophomore Adoree’ Jackson also got involved on offense when he connected with Kessler and jetted off for an 83-yard touchdown. \nThe Trojans had a chance to take the lead going into halftime, but a 36-yard kick off the leg of redshirt junior Alex Wood hammered off of the upright. \nUSC carried its momentum into the second half and reclaimed a seven-point lead on a four-yard touchdown pass from Kessler to redshirt junior tight end Taylor McNamara. USC, however, would be shut out for the rest of the game. \n“I felt like we had the momentum, but we couldn’t stop the inside zone,” junior linebacker Su’a Cravens said. \nPenalties also continued to hurt USC, which committed 10 on the night for 105 yards. \n“At the end of the day mistakes hurt us, whether it was penalties, special teams, some missed tackles and some turnovers on offense,” Helton said. \nBefore the game, Athletic Director Pat Haden felt lightheaded on the sidelines and was taken to the locker room. Haden went to a local hospital and checked out fine before heading back to Los Angeles on a private plane, according to a USC official. \nHaden has been under an increased amount of fire since announcing the termination of former head coach Steve Sarkisian last Monday. \n“Proud of our effort vs. ND, came up just short,” Haden tweeted on Sunday afternoon. \nThe Trojans return home to resume Pac-12 conference play against No. 3-ranked Utah next Saturday. \nThe undefeated Utes (6-0, 3-0) lead the Pac-12 South and are coming off of a 34-18 win at home over Arizona State.
