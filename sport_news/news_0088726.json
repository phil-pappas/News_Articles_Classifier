Stourbridge captain Stuart Pierpoint (second from right) hopes to lead the Glassboys to the first round proper Tweet \nHarriers are yet to win a game this season and currently sit bottom in the National League Premier, meaning many are tipping the Glassboys, who play two divisions below, to claim victory when the rivals meet at the War Memorial Ground in a fourth qualifying round tie. \nBut Pierpoint, who has quickly settled into life at Stour after joining in the summer, reckons his team would be naive to think they are favourites. \n“I think we have to ignore their record because we also recognise the quality they have, being in the division they are in,” he said. \n“We can’t be naive enough to think they don’t have quality to the hurt us because they will have players who can do that. \n“It is important we focus on what we are doing, what we do right and respect but don’t fear them. That is certainly the message.” \nAt 31, Pierpoint is aiming to reach the first round proper for the third time as a player, having twice previously reached the landmark with Nuneaton Town. \nBut he admits the increased media attention, for what is the first meeting between Stourbridge and Kidderminster in a major competition since 1983, means it feels a first round tie in all but name. \n“The fourth qualifying round often feels like a normal game but with the exposure this has got, being a local derby, it has built the anticipation,” he added. \n“It is great for everyone to be involved because the cup runs mean so much to clubs, not just in terms of the fans but also financially.
