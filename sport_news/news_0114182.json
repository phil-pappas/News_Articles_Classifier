Posted: Thursday, October 22, 2015 10:45 pm Hurricanes outlast Bulldogs MARK F. FISHER Correspondent dailycommercial.com | 0 comments \nMOUNT DORA — The Mount Dora Hurricanes kept their playoff hopes alive Thursday night with a 45-36 win over Umatilla in a Class 4A-District 4 game on Senior Night at Mount Dora. \nMount Dora improves to 4-3 overall and 2-1 in the district. The Hurricanes will be in a tie for second place after tonight’s game between district co-leaders South Sumter and Dunnellon. \nThe Hurricanes opened a 14-7 lead after the first quarter and the two teams traded points for the next two quarters with Mount Dora taking a 31-24 lead into the fourth quarter. \nMount Dora turned back one late drive by Umatilla and Hurricanes quarterback Zach Dickinson connected with Josh Parker for an 85-yard touchdown to take a 45-30 lead with two minutes remaining in the game. Umatilla came back to score on a pass play from Josh Enfinger to Dakoda Hammock as time expired to produce the final score. \nMount Dora had entered halftime leading 17-10 as Jared Brown hit a 27-yard field goal to give the Hurricanes the 7-point advantage. Dickinson had passed for one score while running for another in the opening half. \nThe game was briefly tied 17-17 early in the third quarter, giving no indication of the scoring that was to follow. \nUmatilla, which had won the pre-game coin toss and deferred, came out of the locker room after the half and drove 92-yards on the ground as Enfinger and Jocquarius Ward alternated the rushing attack, which culminated with Ward's 28-yard scoring run. Dalton Starling's conversion kick tied the score 17-17 and it looked to be a tight game. \nTied at 17, Mount Dora answered with Dickinson hitting Drew Davis for a 29-yard TD. A Johnny Worthy 40-yard pick-six of an Enfinger pass three plays later had the Hurricanes surging ahead 31-17. But Umatilla would not stay down. \nUmatilla responded with a their own lightning score when Enfinger broke through the secondary and into the open field for the 38-yard score to trail 31-24 with five minutes remaining in the third quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:58:33.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
