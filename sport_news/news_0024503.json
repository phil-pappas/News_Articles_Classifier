We didn't have a good practice. We punched the clock until we got to position work at the very end,\" Pastner said. \"Listen, we (practiced) twice on Saturday, three times on Sunday, twice on Monday and the guys are just exhausted.\"\nAmong the injured were senior guards Ricky Tarrant Jr. (knee) and Kedren Johnson (shoulder).\nTarrant, who's still recovering from knee surgery at Alabama last season, didn't practice. Johnson, who's dealing with a shoulder injury that dates to his time at Vanderbilt, didn't participate in contact drills, but looked relatively sharp in non-contact work. Johnson, who had been projected as the Tigers' starting point guard, still has to decide whether to undergo potentially season-ending shoulder surgery or attempt to play through the pain.\n\"As far as my health goes, I've been playing with this shoulder injury for almost three years now. So it's been a really long time; a really long ride,\" Johnson told a group of Memphis Rebounders gathered for a luncheon Tuesday at the Penny Hardaway Hall of Fame. \"But I'm really motivated to be a part of this team just because of the guys and the relationships that I've been able to make throughout the past two years here in Memphis.\n\"So I'm gonna try my hardest to be part of the team. But I'm just gonna turn it over to God and continue doing everything I can to rehab it.\"\nThe others who missed all or part of Tuesday's practice were junior guard/forward Jake McDowell (knee), junior guard Avery Woodson (knee), freshman forward Dedric Lawson (wrist), freshman guard Randall Broddie (knee), freshman guard Jeremiah Martin (lower back) and freshman guard Raquan Mitchell (knee).\nPastner spoke publicly for the first time Tuesday about the addition of Mitchell, a 6-foot-3 combo guard and former Texas A&M commitment who enrolled at Memphis this week. Though he's an explosive athlete, it remains to be seen whether Mitchell, who averaged 22 points and five rebounds as a senior at Miami (Florida) Southridge, can contribute this season.\n\"He's a superb athlete. He's just behind,\" Pastner said of Mitchell. \"(In his first practice Monday) I felt he was timid at the beginning part, trying to fit in. Then when we went to five-on-five he made some really high-level athletic plays. His transition from one end of the floor to the other ... he was very Geron Johnson-like. Just explosive.\n\"But he's behind right now. Way behind. I talked to him afterward (Monday) and I said, 'Listen, you're not gonna pick everything up right away. Just (go) full speed, and if you mess up you mess up. Go as hard as you can.'\"\nMemphis will resume practice Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:32:26.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
