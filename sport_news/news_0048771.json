Comment Posted Oct. 3, 2015 at 2:44 PM Updated at 2:51 PM Posted Oct. 3, 2015 at 2:44 PM Updated at 2:51 PM KINGSTON - Silver Lake football rallied from behind twice at home Friday night to give first-year Head Coach Chris DiGiacomo his first win in a 13-12 victory over Quincy. Silver Lake (1-3) was down early 6-0 before coming back to take a 7-6 lead before the half. Alec Snell did the honors with a one-yard scoring run. Matt Haite's extra point gave Silver Lake a 7-6 lead That lead stood until there were three minutes left in the game when Garrett Cronin broke off a 48-yard touchdown run. The conversion run failed, leaving it a 12-7 game. With time running short and trailing by a touchdown, Silver Lake picked up a key pass interference call that set up Josh Chapman for a five-yard touchdown run to make it 13-12 with one minute left to play. The Lakers will try to make it two in a row Saturday when they travel to Hingham.
