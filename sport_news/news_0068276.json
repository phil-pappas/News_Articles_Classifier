Edit: A new DGP cometh Saini is sent as DGP-Punjab Police Housing Corporation, an unappealing post. Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal's choice of Arora (DGP-Vigilance) was known in the afternoon. Immediately after joining in the evening, Arora told reporters that his priority would be to ensure \"brotherhood, peace and to uphold the credibility of the police force.\" Arora said he would tour the state from tomorrow to gauge the public opinion. The tour would begin by paying obeisance at Golden Temple tomorrow. \"I will take briefing from police officers and I am willing to meet anyone with a grievance.\" Arora appealed to the protesting organizations and the media to give him time. \"It is your Punjab as much as it is mine. Let us not do anything that causes inconvenience to the public.\" On queries regarding the progress and credibility of the police investigation in firing at protesters and the international conspiracy behind the sacrilege incidents, Arora said he would comment on it after going through the investigation. \"I just want to assure the public that credible action and investigation is my top priority\" said the new DGP. \"Some issues need to be handled as a priority, but those have to be dealt in a transparent manner where we must ensure justice for all,\" he said. He also met ADGP I P S Sahota, who heads the Bureau of Investigation and is in the centre of controversies surrounding the questionable police investigations in a sacrilege incident. Arora also held a meeting with ADGP Rohit Chowdhry, in-charge of Law and Order. Saini is the first major head to roll as the SAD-BJP government looked for steps to cool public anger as the state has been on the boil for almost a fortnight. Sources said the Centre was not appreciative of the handling of the situation by the police, which remained clueless about most of the incidents. Apart from alleged firing at protesters causing death of two persons in Faridkot, the police claims of \"foreign funding\" of the sacrilege incidents also backfired. The two accused settled in Dubai and Australia have confronted the police with their own version. The Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has also sought a report into the investigation. Earlier, the Punjab police courted controversy by not handing over the Dinanagar terror attack investigation to the National Investigation Agency. The police did not let the Army take over despite the District Magistrate's direction. This had also led to bad blood. Appealing for co-operation, the new DGP Suresh Arora said his doors were open to all. \"I always insist that policemen are public servants. I have always believed that unless you engage in talks, no issue can be resolved. I am ready to talk to anyone,\" he said. Now punish the guilty Saini's removal is a welcome step, but the people will not be satisfied until the guilty in the Bargari (Faridkot) firing incident are dismissed and charged with murder - Capt Amarinder Singh, Congress Leader", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:09:45.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
