Corrections Department Director Jerry Bartruff says there would be no risk in the move to the Newton Correctional Facility. He says it was difficult to house the sex offenders in the open environment at the Mount Pleasant prison and that the Newton facility offers individual cells and all levels of housing. Officials say the move will enable the inmates to receive more treatment. The move is expected to take eight to 12 months. The Mount Pleasant facility will become a minimum security prison. State Sen. Chaz Allen says he was surprised by the move but thinks it will ensure the safety of officers and inmates. \n\nCopyright 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
