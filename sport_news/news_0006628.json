Rahul on Friday met 22 prominent Valmiki leaders from Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, urging them to consolidate behind the Congress and promising their community a due representation in electoral politics and party organisation. In Punjab, particularly, where Dalit and Valmiki votes play a crucial role in government formation, Rahul has promised that ticket distribution will be done in a scientific manner. In his meeting with Punjab’s Dalit leaders, including Raj Kumar Verka, Pawan Adia, state Mahila Congress chief Kittu Grewal and Gaja Ram Valmiki of the Central Valmiki Sabha, yesterday, Rahul has said the Congress will strive to give 15 of the 34 reserved seats in the state to Valmikis, a community which has of late been neglected in electoral and organisational equations within the party. Dalits comprise 31 per cent of population in Punjab, which has the highest concentration of the Dalits in India. Among Dalits, Valmikis form a major chunk with 22 per cent. Rahul is learnt to have asked SC cell leaders to visit all districts in Punjab and recommend mechanisms for representation in electoral politics for the state’s Dalits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:05:38.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
