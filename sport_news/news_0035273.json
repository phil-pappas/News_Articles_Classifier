(AP) - The Vermont attorney general's office says a Rutland podiatrist has agreed to pay the state more than $83,000 to settle claims that he obtained payments from Medicaid that shouldn't have gone to him.\nThe settlement involving Dr. Frank Buggiani resolves a civil complaint filed in December 2014 by the attorney general's Medicaid Fraud and Residential Abuse Unit. It regarded the submission of Medicaid claims by Buggiani for custom orthotic devices.\nThe attorney general's office said its investigation showed his claims were at a rate that exceeded the rate charged to other insurers.\nBuggiani cooperated with the investigation.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
