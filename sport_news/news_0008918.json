Restaurant owner to eliminate tips \nDetective Michael Eisenloffel has not ruled out that Odom’s actions were a suicide attempt. \nPolice said the sexual-performance supplements ingested by Odom were legal and were obtained from the Love Ranch. Dennis Hof, the owner of the Love Ranch, claimed on Wednesday that the brothel did not offer supplements to its visitors, despite advertising “Viagra” parties on its website. \nThe initial emergency call came from Mitzi John, an employee of the Love Ranch, who described Odom as unconscious and in need of an ambulance. \nJohn called 911 frantically a second time urging dispatchers to hurry, as Odom had “blood coming out of his nose and white stuff coming out of his mouth.” \nThe telephone was later passed to Richard Hunter, media director of the Love Ranch, who described how Odom had taken the sexual-performance enhancer over the course of three days, having arrived at the ranch on Saturday. USA TODAY Sports' Larry Berger talks about the latest news in NBA. \nHunter also stated that Odom had taken cocaine on Saturday but that staff members could not confirm whether he had taken the drug since. \nThe sheriff’s department were unable to provide further information on Odom’s condition but revealed contact has been made with one member of the Kardashian family, that the person was “understandably distraught in the circumstances.” \nWehrly said it was “distinctly possible” that Odom could face charges of drug possession pending the results of the investigation. She stated that the actions of Love Ranch employees would also be looked into. \nOdom, 35, last played in the NBA in 2013 and was waived by the New York Knicks in July 2014. He was part of the Los Angeles Lakers championship-winning teams in 2009 and 2010. Odom was visited by former teammate Kobe Bryant at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas on Tuesday night. \nHospital officials provided no immediate word on Odom’s condition. Rev. Jesse Jackson was among the visitors on Wednesday and said doctors believe Odom is recovering after being unresponsive. \n“Apparently from what the doctor said, he was much better off today than yesterday. He at least has some responsiveness now,” Jackson said. “He’s got tubes in him now but we felt inspired by his presence. We’re just holding hands and hoping he can bounce back.” Man dies days after being shot at Cowboys stadium tailgate \nOdom has had legal and abuse issues. He was arrested by the California Highway Patrol in August of 2013 on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and or drugs, according to the incident report. That happened after weeks of speculation about his well-being. \nIn December of 2011, Odom was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, after a proposed deal that would have sent him to the New Orleans Hornets as part of a package for point guard Chris Paul was nixed by then-Commissioner David Stern. The stint with the Mavericks was rocky, Odom spent some time in the D-League in March. After the season, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers. \n“Lamar Odom is a long-time member of the Excel family, and we are keeping him in our thoughts and prayers. We are staying close to the situation but have no additional information or comment at this time,\" Excel Sports Management president Jeff Schwartz said in a statement.
