Today, I proved it,” said Arevalo, winner of two international tournaments this year. \nArevalo said she wasn’t aware of what’s happening around her because she was focused on her game. \n“I knew I had to contribute to the team,” said Arevalo who also won the individual gold medal, edging Lois Kaye Go of Cebu Country Club (CCC) via countback. \nBoth Arevalo and Go finished the event with identical 107 points. \nFor the second straight year, Southwoods Masters survived another great battle against CCC, winning by just four points, 559-555. \n“Awesome win,” said Southwoods skipper Marie Claire Ong. \nSouthwoods closed out with 281 points with Maria Sofia Chabon turning in 50 points to back up Arevalo. The other scorers were Loralie Roberto 46, Annika Guangko 44, Missy Legaspi 43 and Ong 40. \nCCC scored 279 points with Go turning in the best score of 53 points. \nGo, who shot 54 points in the opening round, let the gold medal slip from her grasp when she pushed her approach to the bunker in the par-5, 18th hole. She missed the par-saving putt. \nAside from Go, CCC drew 52 points from Junia Gabasa, 51 from skipper Mary Kim Hong, 46 from Crystal Faith Neri, 39 from Josephine Siguan and 38 from Riko Nagai. \nAlabang Country Club (ACC) regained the Founders division title in one-sided fashion, pooling a two-day total of 472 points. \nACC closed out with 253 Saturday to win by 26 points over Camp Aguinaldo. \nJang Eun Sil and Rita Horan led ACC with 47 and 46 points, respectively. Also scoring for ACC were Mary Joselyn Garcia 44, Marilyn Reyes 41, Maria Josefina Gorres 38 and Christine Popp 37. \nAguinaldo was led by Josie Untal’s 45 points while Manila Golf settled for third place with 405 points following a 208 on the final day. \nIn the Sportswriters bracket, Valley Golf also posted a comfortable 26-point win over host NOGCC after putting together 452 points in two rounds. \nLeading Valley were Ma. Consuelo Fregil and Isabela Marivite who scored 45 and 44, respectively. \nThird place went to Bacolod Golf and Country Club which totalled 407. \nLady Eagles Australia romped to victory in the Friendship division with 447 points with Davao Golf and Apo Golf and Country Club settling for second and third with 428 and 398, respectively. \nThe event was sponsored by the Mareco Broadcasting Network (Crossover), Travelife, Business Mirror, Airbus, Splash Philippines, Wealth Inc. and East Gate Publication. \nThe scores: Founders: Alabang 472, 219-253 (M.
