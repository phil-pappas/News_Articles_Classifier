Grant Ramey/News Sentinel UT baseball team coach Dave Serrano in one of the batting cages inside Lindsey Nelson Stadium facility on Wednesday, Feb. 13, 2013. (MICHAEL PATRICK/NEWS SENTINEL) Michael Patrick Previous Next \nDave Serrano isn’t trying to find his Tennessee baseball team’s identity during fall practice. \n“I think at the end of the fall, every coach likes their team,” Serrano said before practice Thursday at Lindsey Nelson Stadium, “pretty much because there’s so much unknown still. We’re still in comfortable settings. \n“We try to create uncomfortable settings for our guys, but the bottom line is there’s 15 or 20 people in the stands every game, we’re playing against our roommates and our best friends.” \nThere’s plenty of work to be done, though, as Serrano’s players identify the about-face the coach’s program is in the process of making. \n“We’re just getting used to practicing,” Serrano said. “We’re teaching them how to practice, the speed we want to practice at, the tempo we want to set each and every day, the expectations we want to set.” \nSerrano announced the philosophical changes before fall camp started, saying he was throwing out the methods that had been successful during his years on the West Coast in favor of what needs to be done to win in the SEC. \nSerrano says that he will be more focused on developing players than he has in the past. \n“We’re not going to reinvent the wheel, but I really challenged our coaching staff that I want to put an emphasis on developing,” Serrano said. “When I look back over my first four years, we’ve developed to try and win instead of developing player by player. \n“That should be our first and foremost duty, to develop each player. As the player develops, the team will develop and get better.” \nSerrano has a wide open infield, where aside from senior Nick Senzel, competition outnumbers decided starters. \n“For the first time, maybe since year one, it’s pretty wide open with what we’ve got going (in) the infield,” he said. “For what we’ve done, I think I like that there are no positions (set).” \nDespite the losses of “three key components” to last year’s pitching staff in Bret Marks, Drake Owenby and Andy Lee, Serrano believes he could have his most complete staff, starting with senior Andy Cox. \nSerrano said he’s seen growth at pitcher from redshirt junior Zach Warren, junior Aaron Soto, sophomore Zach Reid and redshirt junior Eric Freeman, and he’ll rely on senior Kyle Serrano, his son, “living up to expectations.” \n“I like what I see on the mound and I think it has a chance to be, in my five years, the best and the deepest pitching staff we have,” Dave Serrano said, “from the starters all the way to who you hand the ball off to at the end of the game. \n“There’s a lot of good things going on there. And if you ask me, and I’m very biased, if you build a team, it’s going to be with your pitching. I think for the first time, if the potential rises, then we have a chance to be really good on the mound.” \nBut first, starting with fall practices, Serrano is rebuilding his program around different philosophies. \n“I love being here at the University of Tennessee, I want to be here for a long time, but I know you have to win and you have to be successful,” Serrano said. \n“That’s my goal each and every day when I wake up and that’s what my commitment is to my coaches and my players, that I create a setting that can be successful day in and day out.” Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group.
