Those numbers may be misleading in a 24-10 loss to the New York Giants. (Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) Buy Photo Story Highlights Tyrod Taylor has been a bit inconsistent, but his 71.7 completion percentage is certainly impressive. Buffalo's vaunted defensive line has managed just four sacks in the first four game. Injuries on offense, and penalties team wide, have been major concerns for the Bills. 18 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJust like last year, the Bills closed out the first quarter of the NFL season with a ho-hum 2-2 record, coming off a loss -- in 2014 it was to Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Texans, last week it was to Eli Manning and the Giants -- that left a bitter taste in their mouths. \nUnlike last year, new Bills coach Rex Ryan isn't pushing the panic button and benching his starting quarterback, so I guess we can consider that progress. \nDoug Marrone benched EJ Manuel after that loss in Houston, opting for veteran Kyle Orton. Ryan doesn't have a veteran to turn to, but he doesn't need one because Tyrod Taylor has been a pleasant surprise. In the first four starts of his NFL career, Taylor has been predictably up and down, but he has provided some hope for Bills fans starving for competent quarterback play. \nThe Bills are currently in win one lose one mode, and as they head to Tennessee for a game that they really can't afford to lose, let's grade out the Bills for their first quarter performance. \nQUARTERBACK: B-minus -- Taylor won the three-man competition in training camp, and based on the early returns, Ryan made the right choice. Taylor ranks 22nd in ESPN's QBR with a mark of 54.4 (average is 50.0 on the 1-100 scale), but a closer examination of this metric shows he had the best performance of any QB in Week 3, and the fifth-best in Week 1. Taylor has completed 71.7 percent of his passes, third-best among QBs with at least 100 attempts, and he has eight TDs compared to four picks. There have been moments when Taylor has looked tentative, particularly when it comes to using his great athleticism to run out of the pocket, but the Bills didn't lose their two games because of Taylor. \nRUNNING BACK: B-minus -- All that ground and pound talk we heard from the Bills in the offseason really hasn't come to fruition. They ran the ball fairly efficiently until last week against the Giants, and they still rank sixth in the NFL at 128.3 yards per game, but without injured LeSean McCoy and Karlos Williams, it may be tough to keep that up. McCoy has clearly not been at his best due to his hamstring, and he may miss all of the second quarter of the season. Williams has gotten off to a terrific start with 226 yards and four total TDs, but he's out with a concussion so now it's on Boobie Dixon and Boom Herron. It's amazing what has happened to a team that once boasted McCoy, Williams, Dixon, Bryce Brown, and Fred Jackson. Fullback Jerome Felton has had minimal impact having played just 29 percent of the snaps. Buy Photo \nBuffalo's Percy Harvin fights for this deep pass with Jayron Hosley.

(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \nWIDE RECEIVER: C -- Sammy Watkins' inability to stay healthy is once again proving costly to the passing game. The attack simply wasn't sharp last week as the Giants had little trouble neutralizing Percy Harvin and Robert Woods without having to worry about Watkins. Harvin has 19 catches for 218 yards and a TD, while Woods has underwhelmed with 12 catches for 158 yards. As for Watkins, before he got hurt in Miami, he had just seven catches for 99 yards and a TD in nine quarters. Taylor needs this group to start making plays, especially with the running game in rough shape. \nTIGHT END: B-plus -- Charles Clay has given the Bills exactly what they have long needed at this position -- a true downfield threat. Clay leads the team with 21 catches for 255 yards (second-most yards for a TE in the NFL) and two TDs. Particularly in the previous two games with Watkins sidelined all but one quarter, Clay became Taylor's go-to guy and he caught 14 passes for 193 yards combined. Beyond Clay, it's a dead zone. Matthew Mulligan is strictly a blocker who has played 22 percent of the snaps, MarQueis Gray did nothing before landing on injured reserve with a broken forearm, and Chris Gragg has only been active for one game. \nOFFENSIVE LINE: C -- This group hasn't been bad, but it still needs to make vast improvement. LG Richie Incognito has played very well (that chop block penalty last week that cost the Bills a TD was a bogus call) and he's the rock up front. LT Cordy Glenn had been rather average until an excellent game last week when he played through an ankle injury. On the right side, rookie John Miller struggled before getting hurt, and his replacement, Kraig Urbik, is well below average. At RT, Seantrel Henderson remains wildly inconsistent, and C Eric Wood has played better in the first quarter than he did for most of last year. However, having Urbik next to him again is helping. The line has allowed 10 sacks, but at least half of those can be pinned on Taylor not getting rid of the ball, and the run game is averaging 4.2 yards per attempt. However, the line is responsible for 10 of Buffalo's 47 accepted penalties. Buy Photo \nBills Jerry Hughes looks to make the tackle on Giants RB Rashad Jennings (23). (Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \nDEFENSIVE LINE: C -- The expectations were as enormous as their salaries, and Mario Williams, Jerry Hughes, Marcell Dareus, and Kyle Williams have not met them. The Bills have only seven sacks, just four from the line, and last week New York pushed the line around in the run game, especially in the first half. The quick passing games of the Patriots and Giants really prevented the front four from generating pressure, but there has to be an adjustment moving forward because the Bills may get a steady diet of hurry-up, short passing attacks. Part of the problem has been communicating in Rex Ryan's more complex defense, but four games in, that needs to get shored up. \nThe SalSpeak Buffalo Bills podcast is now available on iTunes.

Nigel Bradham has played well, but his missed tackle last week on the game-clinching TD was a brutal failure. Preston Brown is tied for the team lead with 35 tackles, but he needs to get his emotions in check. Manny Lawson is starting to slow down and hasn't been effective against the run, as a pass rusher, or in coverage. However, the Bills don't have any depth, part of the reason why Bradham has played every defensive snap, and Brown has played 97 percent.

Hilton. the play set up the Bills first touchdown in a 27-14 win over the colts (Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \nSECONDARY: B-plus -- Everyone knew the Bills were going to need their corners to hold up in Ryan's defense because they'd be in so much one-on-one coverage, and thus far, Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby have been very good. Darby leads the NFL with 11 pass breakups and has two picks, while Gilmore has been steady against some of the league's top receivers. Safety Corey Graham has been a steadying influence in the back end, especially with Aaron Williams having missed two games, and he's tied for the team lead with 35 tackles. Getting shredded by Tom Brady for 466 yards has killed Buffalo's rankings, but in the other three games, this unit has been rock solid. \nSPECIAL TEAMS: D -- One season after ranking No. 2 in the Dallas Morning News industry-standard rankings, the Bills have been a train wreck. Outside of punter Colton Schmidt who has an above-average 43.0 net average, there's not much to like. Dan Carpenter has missed three kicks and his job is on the line, and though he didn't deserve it, kickoff specialist Jordan Gay was replaced by Billy Cundiff, who may ultimately replace Carpenter. The Bills got nothing out of the return game, so Marcus Thigpen was cut and replaced by Denarius Moore. The coverage units have been OK, but penalties -- as they are team-wide -- have been a big problem. \nCOACHING: B-minus -- The penalty woes are a player issue, but they can be partially blamed on coaching, too. Ryan has to rein in his team and get it to play more under control. I don't like the way Ryan has handled Dan Carpenter, and I haven't liked his petulant post-game pressers following the two losses, but overall, I'm on board with him. Greg Roman has shown great creativity, with the exception of last week. As for Dennis Thurman, I'm not sure what to say about him because he's the defensive coordinator only in name; this is Rex's defense. On special teams, Danny Crossman -- a Doug Marrone holdover -- has to get things turned around. \nMAIORANA@Gannett.com 18 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1LoypB5 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:40:12.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
