But for three players, it has long been routine.\nJordan Cameron, Dion Sims and Jake Stoneburner likely know new interim coach Dan Campbell better than any of their teammates. They’re tight ends who have been coached by Campbell for however long each has been in Miami. And while it may seem predictable that all three offered a thumbs-up to their new head coach following last week’s promotion, they also offered perspective on what the entire squad can expect.\nAllen Eyestone Miami Dolphins tight end Jordan Cameron (84) makes a leaping catch in front of Washington Redskins free safety Trenton Robinson (34) at FedExField in Landover, Maryland on September 13, 2015. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) “Everyone can relate to him and see what guys in our room have been dealing with the past couple of years,” Stoneburner said.\nBy now, it’s no secret that Campbell preaches hard-nosed, tough-guy aggressiveness. But the tight ends describe it not as a drill-sergeant approach, but rather from the perspective of a man who ground out 11 years in the NFL himself as a blocking tight end, not a flashy, pass-catching receiver.\n“He gets what we go through each day,” Stoneburner said.\nAllen Eyestone Miami Dolphins tight end Dion Sims (80) breaks a tackle after a catch as New York Jets cornerback Darrin Walls (30) defends at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida on December 28, 2014. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) Cameron added that Campbell has been there before. “He’s played 11 years in the NFL, or 10 years, whatever he did. He knows what he’s talking about. The trust that you have in somebody who’s been through it, day in and day out … I think it’s very important.”\nIt’s no coincidence that there’s a blurred line between whether Campbell played 10 or 11 seasons. He was injured his final season, in New Orleans, and effectively spent it helping Sean Payton coach the Saints to a Super Bowl title. The Dolphins’ tight ends are aware of that — in football circles, Campbell is a renowned storyteller.\n“He always used to talk about how when he was playing football and how tough (it was) and how easy we’ve got it,” Stoneburner said. “Not how easy we’ve got it, but they had those two-a-days in the heat, full pads every day. He has a lot of stories like that. And then some good, inappropriate ones.”\nUpon hearing that last point, Cameron smirked.\nCampbell is credited with helping develop Charles Clay, who at one point was rated by his peers as one of the top 100 players in the league and parlayed those teachings into a $38 million free-agent contract with the Buffalo Bills this year.\n“He pretty much got me to where I’m at now with his teaching ability,” said Stoneburner, an undrafted, third-year player out of Ohio State who has two touchdown receptions. “It’s very deserving that he gets the opportunity to coach the entire team.”\nAnother endorsement came from Buffalo.\n“It’s a great move for that team,” Clay told the Associated Press. “He’s a lot of fun to be around, but at the same time, he’s going to work the mess out of you. They’ll love him.”\nSims pointed out that Campbell played in Dallas under Bill Parcells, who once headed the Dolphins’ football operations.\n“I met Bill and he seemed like that kind of guy,” Sims said of Campbell. “He’s just hard-nosed and tough. Just get the job done.”\nAlthough the Dolphins are 1-3, Cameron doesn’t believe Campbell has as monumental a task ahead as some think.\n“It’s nothing major that he needs to unlock,” Cameron said. “It’s guys having energy in practice and transferring that to the game. I think you can’t just go through motions during the week and show up on Sunday and expect to win one-on-one battles.”\nCampbell, 39, played at 6-foot-5 and 263 pounds.\n“He looks like he could still suit up,” Stoneburner said. “Yeah, definitely. I don’t know if it adds to how well he can coach, but maybe he can get big and intimidate some other coaches.”\nSUNDAY’S GAME\nDolphins at Titans\n1 p.m., CBS\n</p", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/13/9c/00/122814-spt-fins-ae-13.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/13/6c/00/091315_spt_fins_ae_18.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:13:52.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
