There were the injuries, the offseason loss of Jarome Iginla, the lack of quality backup goaltending.\nBut there was also something else a little more subtle, a little less tangible.\nThere was a widening gap between the core players like Zdeno Chara, Patrice Bergeron, Milan Lucic — guys that built the Bruins into an elite team and won a Stanley Cup in 2011 — and the younger players who were being infused into the mix. A divide like that doesn’t necessarily happen acrimoniously or even consciously, but several players, in hindsight, have conceded that it did occur.\nIf this team wants to push forward, it can’t happen again. The date June 15, 2011, the night the B’s raised the Cup in Vancouver, is ancient history in hockey years. There are still eight players here from that team, some still in their prime, some on the other side of it. They can’t pull the whole freight themselves. It is imperative that the new and younger players take ownership of this team, too.\nAnd some new leaders need to be identified and nurtured. Chara has been the captain since he signed here in 2006, but the leadership of this team has always been by committee. Brad Marchand, who has been outspoken in this training camp, wants in, as does Adam McQuaid, both of whom were just rookies in 2011. The committee could use a few more members who hunger for their own Cup ring.\nAnd unlike last season, everyone has to be pulling in the same direction.\n“That’s the goal we had in this training camp, to make everyone feel comfortable and realize we’re all in it together and that’s the only way we can go about our business,” said Bergeron last week. “For sure (the new and younger players) are just as important as we are. And the younger veterans, guys like Marchy and Quaider, guys that have been around for a few years, we want them to have a voice and keep getting better in that matter. And they want to do that, too, which is great. It’s definitely something we want to have and, if we do, we’re going to be a closer and better team.”\nBergeron, who is likely the next B’s captain whenever Chara hangs them up, knows as well as anyone that it can take time for leaders to emerge. When he arrived in Boston as an 18-year-old in the fall of 2003, he was a quiet kid from Quebec City, not fully confident in his English. But he had older players who watched out for him, guys like Felix Potvin, Brian Rolston, P.J. Axelsson and Martin Lapointe, who invited his young fellow Quebecois to live with him.\nBergeron wants to pay it forward.\n“I’ve been in that situation, being a young guy and shy and not necessarily comfortable and the older guys did a great job to bring me in and make me feel comfortable,” said Bergeron. “I guess now it’s my turn to do the same thing, kind of return the favor and make everyone realize that we’re all equal and we need everyone on and off the ice to be themselves.”\nGeneral manager Don Sweeney said it can be intimidating for new players, especially younger ones, coming into a locker room stocked with Cup winners and a few Hall of Fame candidates. But there’s a constant evolution that needs to take place.\n“Young players generally start out a little bit as individuals. They’re just trying to find their place. Then when you move through the league, you realize you’ve got more to impart around the room,” said Sweeney. “But until you get to that point, it’s tough. It’s incumbent upon our group to make sure we’re pulling those guys in and they feel equally as important on and off the ice. The minutes might not reflect it, but at other times they might. There’s a transition involved. We’ve got several new faces. You’ve seen how Matt Beleskey has come in and integrated himself. Jimmy Hayes is a charismatic kid that wants to be here. All of those things are hopefully going to foster that type of atmosphere that we need.”\nMarchand was asked who among the younger generation of Bruins he thought would develop into a team leader. His answer was immediate and unsurprising — Torey Krug. Since signing with the B’s as a free agent out of Michigan State, Krug has exhibited confidence in himself and has not been afraid to speak up in the room. It was telling that the organization brought in Krug to speak to the recent draftees in development camp last July.\n“I think one thing when it comes to leadership, you can’t force the issue,” said Krug. “You have to be authentic. Usually the guys that talk too much about it are not the ones you want to be following, but I think there’s definitely the opportunity for young guys to step up. The second tier of leadership is growing, for sure. We have a lot of guys that are leaders in this room, and that’s kind of the Bruins’ way when they’re recruiting people.”\nBeleskey, who signed a five-year deal in July, is another player who can bolster the ranks.\n“I think I’m just trying to lead with my work ethic and, off the ice, just trying to help the young guys,” said Beleskey. “I’m trying to find my way around here myself but I think I’m just going to try to be myself and be the player that I am. Hopefully the leadership role comes with that. It’s something I’ve done in my past. I was captain of my team in juniors. You have to help some of the young guys make that transition into pro and if I can be a part of that, that’d be great.”\nAnd at some point, the young guys will have to help the older guys, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:36:27.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
