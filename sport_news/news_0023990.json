However, doctors remained concerned that he is allowed sufficient rest for his healing to continue. His estranged wife Khloe Kardashian remained at the facility as of Monday afternoon and was corresponding with some of Odom’s friends.\nOdom, a former NBA Sixth Man of the Year and two-time world champion with the Los Angeles Lakers, was found unresponsive at a Nevada brothel called the Love Ranch last Tuesday, following a three-day stay at the establishment. Police were told that he had used cocaine and sexual enhancement supplements in the preceding days.\nA report that Odom may be transported to Los Angeles to further his rehabilitation could not be confirmed by USA TODAY Sports. However, the source stated that there was “zero chance” of the 35-year-old being moved until doctors were certain that moving him would not be a source of stress or discomfort.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyIp2.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Lamar", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfD8Dm.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB4kdvW&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;NBA", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Lamar", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfCG7n.img&quot;}}", "http://api.wochit.com/api/?partnerID=f421a246974545c6e1fb724595053584efa8cc05492e9685c8c2ea4e90f3768d&amp;action=MRSS&amp;topicName=Entertainment&amp;descendants=true&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;basketball_nba&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Liv", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfroW7.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfAKkd.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkIUP&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Lamar", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:03:24.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
