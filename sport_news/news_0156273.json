Laughable!\" \nHe added: \"I would never say anything negative about the boys or staff. We gave everything we had, just wasn't enough and we all take responsibility.\" \nLancaster fears he will forever bear the scars of having presided over England's worst World Cup performance. \nIt has taken only 16 days for a tournament launched amid high expectation to be reduced to rubble by successive defeats by Wales and Australia, who between them amassed 61 points at Twickenham. \nThe Rugby Football Union will launch an inquest once the World Cup is over, mindful that the review should not divert attention away from an event that has otherwise been very well received. \n\"I'm the head coach and we didn't get out of the pool. This is going to sit with us all forever - players, coaches, management,\" Lancaster said. \n\"I don't think I'll ever come to terms with it personally because it was such a big thing. \n\"We lost two games, but they were crucial games and ultimately that let us down.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:04.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
