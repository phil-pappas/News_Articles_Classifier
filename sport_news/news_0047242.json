The family runs two separate conglomerates.\nOther clans not rich enough to make the list include Parle Products' Chauhans with a net worth of US $2.7 billion, DLF's Singh family (USD 2.65 billion), Marico's Mariwalas (US $2.55 billion), Berger Paints' Singh family (US $2.5 billion), Bharat Forge's Kalyanis (US $2.1 billion), Forbes said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:29:23.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
