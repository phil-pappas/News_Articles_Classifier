The list of shootings on or near college campuses across the country continues to grow. So do the concerns and questions about whether 'it could happen here.' \nCampus security is a hot topic right now at Augustana University. \nThe Augustana Mirror is the campus newspaper that reflects what's happening at the university and what students are talking about. \n\"I think students are definitely aware of the shootings that have gone on across the country,\" Sarah Kocher said. \nKocher writes for the paper. She's currently working on an article about campus security. \n\"I think students who are concerned on campus, so far are concerned about things like bike theft, I haven't heard anything about shooting concerns on campus,\" Kocher said. \nRick Tupper, who is in charge of campus security and was recently elected to serve on a national board that reviews policies to help prevent campus crimes, says 'you can never say never.' \n\"You don't want to play armchair quarterback, but you do want to look at, are there things that could have been done that may have prevented that situation?\" Tupper said. \nAfter every campus shooting, Tupper says he and his 14 unarmed security officers review policies and procedures. \nAugustana also has a program called EARS, which stands for Early Alert and Referral System. \nIt encourages anyone on campus to report suspicious activity. \n\"If you see changes in a person's behavior or you know something is changing in a person's life that may impact their ability to deal with it we want a system that's an early reporting system,\" Tupper said. \nSo, as with a lot of shootings, they're not asking the question, 'why didn't we see the warning signs?' \nTupper says his security officers also patrol the three-block radius around the campus to help be the eyes and ears for the neighborhood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:19:04.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
