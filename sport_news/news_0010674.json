Pic/AFP \nThe Uruguayan-Serbian pairing of Pablo Cuevas and Viktor Troicki took just 54 minutes to easily beat Bopanna and Isner 6-4, 6-3 on the hard courts of the Beijing Olympic Green Tennis Center which was built for the 2008 Olympic Games.\nThe Indo-American combine were broken thrice in the contest, twice in the second set, as they could not match the swift movement and charismatic net play of their opponents. Bopanna and Isner had three breakpoint opportunities in the match but all were wasted.\nAlso, three double faults by the losing pair did not help matters as Cuevas and Troicki sailed into the quarterfinals.\nLeander Paes, with Australia's John Peers, had too lost his opener on Tuesday when the pair went down to Canadian-French fourth seeds Daniel Nestor and Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-7(1), 6-4, 9-11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:40:42.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
