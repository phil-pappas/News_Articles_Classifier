He had to be removed from the field by cart.\n“Jalen Watts-Jackson, great job scooping it up,” Dantonio said. “I think he dislocated his hip, or has a broken hip. He’s at the hospital right now. On that particular play as he went in the end zone, that’s what happened, or before the play, I’m not sure what. By the time I got there he was down. But outstanding play by him.”\nA team spokesperson said after the game that Watts-Jackson suffered a dislocated hip during the celebration.\nWatts-Jackson's injury adds to the lore of a seldom-used reserve defensive back who made a play that will go down as one of the most memorable in Spartans history.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kyprettii", "http://t.co/lXmR2PuVrQ", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfz2x8.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Syracuse", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Florida", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658340-college-football-week-7-photos-pictures-ncaa-auburn-kentucky-charles-walker-ricardo-louis/slide/366608", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2015-10-17/michigan-state-fumble-return-touchdown-michigan-wolverines-spartans", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Michigan", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfzi6z.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Florida", "https://twitter.com/EricLacy/status/655583270218964992", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/2015/10/17/msus-watts-jackson-injured-winning-touchdown/74157740/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_ncaa&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Syracuse", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfyZFU.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://www.mlive.com/spartans/index.ssf/2015/10/michigan_states_jalen_watts-ja.html", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfzflJ.img&quot;}}", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658517-michigan-state-beats-michigan-blocked-punt-jim-harbaugh-what-we-learned"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:59:50.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
