Phillips Field. Pruitt also had two of Ashland’s three sacks and the Grizzlies turned a blocked punt by Mel Elshalom into another touchdown in a dominant defensive performance that limited the Spartans to 108 yards of total offense. “They did an awesome job,” Ashland head coach Charlie Hall said of the Grizzly defense. “Our kicking game and our defense kept us in the game early and we kind of got our offense going in the second half. It was a great night to send our seniors off at home.” Ashland (6-2, 2-2 MWL) snapped a two-game losing streak and heads into next Friday’s regular-season finale at Eagle Point tied with Churchill for third in the MWL standings. Marist (3-5, 1-3), which has lost four of its last five, is fifth in the league standings and must upset top-ranked Springfield next week to have any shot at earning the one at-large Class 5A playoff bid. The Grizzlies were nursing a one-point lead, 7-6, early in the third when Pruitt sacked Marist quarterback Reow Jackson and forced a fumble that was recovered by Ashland’s Collin McGuire at the Marist 36. Seven plays later Kyle Weinberg threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Walker Shibley. Pruitt delivered again only a few minutes later, snaring Jackson’s pass in the flat and sprinting to the end zone for a lightning-quick pick-six. On the ensuing possession Ashland’s defense came up with its third big play in about four minutes of game time when Shibley went airborne for an interception near midfield. Ashland ended up fumbling away the scoring opportunity inside the 10, but its defense forced a Marist punt that Shashi Penn returned 26 yards to the Marist 3, and two plays later Weinberg found Shibley again for a 6-yard touchdown pass and a 27-6 Ashland lead. Weinberg completed 6 of 7 passes for 44 yards after replacing starter Tucker Atteberry to start the third quarter. Shibley had seven catches for 55 yards and Pruitt two catches for 32 yards. “We put (Weinberg) in the game because I just think (Atteberry) was having a rough time with things,” Hall said, “and we were able to run the ball. I think that’s probably a big thing that’s been lacking the last couple weeks.” Mason Dow led the Grizzlies with 75 yards rushing and also recovered the blocked punt for the first score of the game with 4:45 to go in the first half. Weinberg added 32 yards rushing, as the Grizzlies outgained the Spartans 155 to 47 on the ground. Jackson’s 10-yard touchdown pass to Justin Kearney on fourth-and-8 with 46 seconds to go in the first half capped a 92-yard drive that saw the Spartans convert three fourth downs. Marist didn’t cross midfield again until Joe Blansett’s 47-yard punt return gave the Spartans a first down at the Ashland 45 with 9:12 to go in the game. By then the Grizzlies led by what turned out to be the final margin, and Marist punted four plays later. “We had our backs against the wall the last two weeks,” Hall said. “And we haven’t had very good luck against Marist as you know, and it’s good to see that we have that resolve and that determination. We tried to talk about grit this week and how that stamina and determination needs to come out.” Jackson completed 9 of 18 passes for 61 yards and was picked off once. He led the Spartans with 31 yards rushing, and Kearney had four catches for 43 yards. Prep Volleyball An inspired Churchill team defeated Ashland in the final Midwestern League volleyball match Friday, 25-23, 18-25, 25-23, 25-18. Ashland (21-7, 9-3 MWL), finished second in the MWL and will advance to the first round of the state playoffs next Saturday. But the Grizzlies' opponent, location and time have not been determined. “Churchill had a really good block and their overall defense was very scrappy,” said Ashland coach Robin Akpan. “We had a hard time putting the ball away.\" Ashland's Ellie Case, a senior hitter, put down 15 kills and had three aces, while setter Karlie Richardson distributed 28 assists to go with 10 kills. “Churchill has really come together,” said Akpan. “They were ready to play.” Tim Trower contributed to this report.
