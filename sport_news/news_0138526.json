He was responsible for three TDs. WAYNE — Ramapo coach Drew Gibbs joked that his senior quarterback Keith Woetzel does everything, even selling programs at halftime.\nFriday night against Wayne Hills, well, Woetzel did just about everything but that. He ran for two scores, passed for 185 yards, and ran back an interception 89 yards as the Green Raiders dominated the Patriots, 34-7.\nThe win boosts the Green Raiders’ (4-1) chances of gaining a top-four seed in the stacked North 1, Group 3 playoff bracket.\n“Our friends from Pascack Valley said last week, ‘Wayne Hills is back,’ ” Gibbs said. “Well, if Wayne Hills is back, then so is Ramapo.”\nWayne Hills (4-2) had won seven of the past eight games between the schools, but Ramapo’s lone win in that stretch came in the 2009 North 1, Group 3 final.\nBoth teams have title aspirations, but have different offensive ways of getting there. The Patriots have a good mix with running back Luca Grave and quarterback Brendan DeVera, and tight end Joe Kenny is formidable. Their offense is more, shall we say, traditional.\nAt Ramapo, it’s basically 7 seconds or less. Everything is done in a hurry. Purists may say it’s not really football. I mean, it’s pretty far away from 3 yards and a cloud of dust.\nBut no one plays on dirt and dust any more (and thank goodness for artificial turf, especially with the storm Friday night). The name of the game is skill players and quarterbacks who are deadly accurate, and threats to run as well.\nWoetzel certainly fits the bill. The 6-foot-1 senior showed off plenty of skill Friday night and the Green Raiders’ offense and defense followed his lead.\n“We thought he was capable of this,” Gibbs said. “I think the one area you get impressed with is his game management and poise at the quarterback spot. Also, for a guy in his first year as a starting quarterback, his leadership, just his demeanor in a big game. He steps up. He doesn’t crumble under the pressure.”\n“I’m the first quarterback to be in the system all four years,” Woetzel said. “I played different positions throughout the year, but I always had my mind in the playbook as a quarterback. It takes a little time to master the offense, but our offense has great depth.”\nThe Patriots’ best chance to stop the Green Raiders may have come on the third play of the game. After a 3-yard loss on first down, and a gain of 2 by Joe O’Hagan on a run up the middle, Ramapo faced third-and-11.\nWoetzel calmly fired a pass to O’Hagan in the flat, and with two receivers blocking for him, O’Hagan cut toward the sideline and gained 12 yards, just enough for the first down.\nO’Hagan would score on a 4-yard run to give the Green Raiders a 7-0 lead with 8:45 left in the first quarter.\nAfter forcing a Wayne Hills punt, Woetzel and company went to work, marching 58 yards in seven plays. Woetzel scrambled twice for good gains on the drive, and then swept right 14 yards for a touchdown. That drive only took 90 seconds off the clock.\nWayne Hills answered as Grave took a shovel pass 71 yards down to the Green Raiders’ 13. Two plays later, DeVera connected with Vinny LoVerde on a curl route in the end zone to make it 14-7.\nRamapo upped the lead to 20-7 with another quick jaunt; this one took nine plays and 80 yards in 2:42. The best play on that drive came on third-and-7.\nWoetzel, with three receivers to one side, noticed he had one-on-one coverage on the other side and threw a perfect pass on a go route to Greg Latushko for a gain of 32. O’Hagan scored his second TD of the half on an 8-yard burst.\nWoetzel also made a huge defensive play in the third quarter when he chased down Grave after a 75-yard run, putting the Patriots at the Ramapo 10. They would not score.\n“That’s just our team motto, we do that every day in practice, we just hustle,” Woetzel said. “I knew that it wasn’t going to be for nothing. I knew we would stop them. That’s just how our defense plays.”\nWhen Gibbs was reminded that the North 1, Group 3 section was loaded with dynamic River Dell and powerful Pascack Valley, he didn’t miss a beat.\n“Yes, and so is Ramapo.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:49:18.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
