(Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post) \nThe Redskins celebrated their annual “Alumni Homecoming” day on Sunday, and as part of the festivities, they inducted former center Jeff Bostic into the Ring of Fame at halftime. \nA member of the famed “Hogs” offensive line that paved the way for the franchise’s success on offense during the 1980s and early ‘90s, Bostic played for Washington from 1980 to 1993 and started in all four Super Bowls, helping Washington to victory in three of them. He’s one of three centers in NFL history to start in four Super Bowls. Former Redskins center Jeff Bostic acknowledges the crowd with his three Super Bowl rings after being inducted into the Redskins ring of fame on Sunday. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nBostic spent his entire 14-year NFL career with the Redskins. \nPrior to the game, Bostic and 144 other former Redskins players and staff members held a reunion on the sideline, and they were introduced on the field just before the current players. \nThen at halftime, Bostic’s name was unveiled in the Ring of Fame. \n“It’s so special,” Bostic said in an interview before the start of Sunday’s game. I’ve told my teammates it’s not about me, it’s about we. It’s an individual honor, but when you look back at the 46 people whose names are in this stadium and are already in the ring of fame, it’s very humbling. You look at the inaugural class of the Hall of Fame with Sammy Baugh, you look at Vince Lombardi, Joe Gibbs, Bobby Mitchell, Darrell Green, Art Monk, Russ Grimm. We could go on and on. Eddie LeBaron, Charlie ‘Choo-Choo’ Justice, Charlie Taylor. And to think you’re part of that fraternity, I’ve got goosebumps right now just talking about it.” \nAsked about the key to the longevity he displayed during his career, Bostic laughed and said, “Luck!” \nHe then added, “I had a very severe knee injury in 1984, my fifth year, and played nine more years in it tour three of four ligaments and [former team doctor] Stan Levine put me back together. I had rotator cuff surgery in year 13 and wasn’t going out on injured reserve. Came back for year 14, but my right knee was done by then. I had nothing left. I regretted nothing. I left everything I had on the field, in the weight room, in the film room. I’d been to pro Bowls, won world championships. I’d done everything there was to do.” \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:40:18.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
