Because of a lovely friend of mine, my wife and I were in the house that next night for Big Blue Madness, and the prospect of another Final Four in basketball had perked me up. \nIt was awesome. \nAt the end of the event, my wife and I made our way down to the court. Advice: Listen to Matt Jones. Act like you belong, and you will get in. We mingled with the folks on the floor and low and behold I found myself face to face with the man in charge: UK Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart. \nAs a journalist I’d never seen the man outside of professional situations before. I re-introduced myself and my wife and I told him I needed to say something. \nHe stopped, and like the nice guy he is, gave me his undivided attention. \nThat’s when I thanked him. \nWith the crowd around us still buzzing and players high-fiving fans, I told Mitch I appreciated what he’d done to get us to this point. \nThe recently named AD of the Year just smiled and shook my hand. He said he appreciated that – but his smile faded for a moment. \n“You know, we let one get away last night, one I wish we could’ve gotten,” he said, referring to the Auburn football loss. \nThe pain in his voice was real, still there after more than 24 hours. He shook his head. The man is competitive for sure. And you could tell in that moment how much he cared about UK sports and his coaches – and how much he wants to win for his fans. \nIt made me appreciate him even more. \nI told him that it’s a testament of how far we’ve come that we can feel so bad about not beating Auburn. Because we knew we should’ve won – it shows UK football is a player now in the SEC. And that is commendable. \nAnd that’s what I said. \nHe seemed to take it in, but he wasn’t satisfied. We talked for a few minutes more and I tried to convey how much I appreciated his work. \nAt no time in my life have UK’s sports teams been as respected or competitive – from men and women’s basketball on down to that outstanding rifle team. \nThere are other AD’s across the country who do wonderful jobs, but not with the professionalism and humility of ours at UK. I wouldn’t want anyone else in that position. \nSo many times these days, people only talk when they’re upset, when they disagree with what’s going on. Call it Facebook syndrome. I know it as a journalist – few times do you hear someone compliment your work. \nI’d like to change that. I like people to know when I appreciate them. \nSo I was glad I got to say it to Mitch Friday night. \nIn short, I hope other fans feel the same way – and I hope that, if they get the opportunity, they’ll tell him the same thing. \nWe’re lucky, and it’s time we start showing it. \nAgree? Disagree? Let me know. Hit me up @rhinoKSR and check me out on the web at ForRyanOutLoud.com. \nArticle written by Ryan Clark Ryan Clark has spent most of his life avoiding real work. He has walked the back nine with Tiger Woods, partied with Lebron James in New York and watched Kentucky basketball with Ashley Judd. He's hunted for ghosts in Civil War mansions, screened a movie with Cameron Crowe and interviewed Klan members while eating fried Twinkies at the Mississippi State Fair. He's made bets at the Kentucky Derby with Gilbert Gottfried, shared bootcamp quarters with our nation's finest National Guardsmen and women, and was even named an honorable mention Academic All-American while on academic probation at WKU. It makes sense then that he's now an editor and an instructor at Northern Kentucky University. 11 responses to “UK A.D. is A-Plus: The man in charge is doing a great job – and we should let him know we think so” Bluego October 19, 2015 at 9:11   \nI think the job of ANY AD at a big school (UK, BAMA, UF, UT, UL,etc) is over rated. For example with UK basketball– Anyone could succeed IMO. Best facilities, best fans, basically unlimited funds to hire, build, recruit with no financial worry. I think Mitch has done a good job, but come on, its not that difficult. Aristotle October 19, 2015 at 9:20   \nBluego probably stocks shelves at Walmart and it telling people managing a college athletic department isn’t that difficult.

Sean October 19, 2015 at 10:27 pm | Permalink \nYeah BCG and that whole coach-in-waiting deal with Joker was a disaster. Presently, the inability to deal with a dissenting opinions makes him unlikable. BenHur October 19, 2015 at 9:28   \nIn my opinion, UK athletics has never been in a better position. Also, we didn’t have to give up our morals, commit fraud, or sell our souls like UL to get there. Mitch didn’t do it all, but he had a part in all of it, from the coaching hires, to the facilities, to the bright future. BtownUKFan October 19, 2015 at 10:33 pm | Permalink \nAgreed, two of the last three ADs left under a cloud. C. M. Newton had worked at Vanderbilt and Alabama as a coach. Barnhart has done an outstanding job of raising the level of all UK sports and the three highest profile coaching jobs are filled by good men. Also, he has helped the head coaches to keep their assistants. Jimbob Bautista October 19, 2015 at 9:54   \nGreat article, and well said, Ryan. Bluehaz October 19, 2015 at 10:10   \nThere are many sports ar UK, other than basketball and football. Look at the whole picture, UK is at the top. Give the AD the credit he deserves !! I am proud to be a UK fan.
