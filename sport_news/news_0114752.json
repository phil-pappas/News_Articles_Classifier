The umpires reviewed the play and ruled that the interference was incidental, and that the run counted.\nSome infuriated fans in the stands began throwing beer cans onto the field and there were reports that a baby had been hit.\nPlayers were taken off the field, while manager John Gibbons consulted with the umpires, resulting in an 18-minute delay. Gibbons is now protesting the game.\nMore on thestar.com\nFans recall their favourite Blue Jays moments from the series (so far)\nLeafs living life on Babcock Standard Time: Feschuk", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:09:39.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
