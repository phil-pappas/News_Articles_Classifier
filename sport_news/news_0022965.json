Not openly, anyway. They spouted their usual rhetoric about this game being like every other game on the schedule.\nIt was nothing special.\nPlayers wouldn’t jump in when asked about exacting any kind of Deflategate payback to the team that sparked the investigation. They wouldn’t admit to wanting to slaughter the Colts.\nBut that doesn’t mean the sentiment doesn’t exist. Wouldn’t you have loved to have been a fly on the walls of the Gillette Stadium meeting rooms last week to listen in to what was really being said by the players and coaches as they prepared for their AFC rivals?\nWouldn’t you love to know what Bill Belichick was saying to gain just the right emotional pitch with his team for tonight? Or Tom Brady, who was impacted most by the Deflategate taint?\nTo get an idea, we consulted some former Patriots who played for Belichick, and were leaders on championship teams.\nWhat happens behind closed doors in Foxboro before games like this? Does Belichick even need to say anything? Or is it unspoken?\nFormer Patriots great Rodney Harrison , who had a reputation for inventing slights just to stir the pot and get the team motivated, pointed to the latter scenario\n“It’s one of those things where, it’s nothing that’s really talked about, ‘Oh, we’re going to go kick their butt.’ I mean, everyone knows what happened,” Harrison told the Herald Thursday. “I think for this game, it’s just more of a sense of urgency from the coaching staff in terms of the way they teach.\n“The meetings will be more focused. (Coaches) will be less tolerant of mistakes and missed assignments. So I’d say it’s like having the 1,000-pound elephant in the room. Everyone knows it’s there. It’s not really spoken about. But with the coaches, you’re going to get more of a focused week. In the meetings rooms, there’s more of a sense of urgency. It’s nothing that’s talked about. But you can tell it’s an important week.”\nHarrison’s “1,000-pound elephant” is, of course, a metaphor for Deflategate. While the primary beef is with Roger Goodell and the NFL, the investigation does have its roots with Colts general manager Randy Grigson complaint to the league after believing balls the Patriots used in their regular-season blowout of the Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium were underinflated.\nBelichick and the coaching staff have been known to use bulletin board material to get a boost. They highlight newspaper clips or read from what others have been saying about the Patriots, whether it’s an opposing player, or media critic.\n“The coaches read everything,” Patriots Hall of Famer Willie McGinest told the Herald Wednesday. “They know everything that’s going on. Sometimes they’ll use that stuff as motivation, just to alert people, alert the team — this is what people are saying, this is what people think. It’s a great motivational tool. It’s not something you do every week, but when you need it, yeah, they’ll do that.\n“I’m sure when they played the Bills (in Week 2), they pulled out all the stuff written about how great that defense was, and how nobody could move the ball against them. I’m sure the offense had an earful when it came to that.\n“Every week, it’s something different.”\nNeither Harrison, McGinest nor former offensive lineman Matt Light believed the words “Deflategate,” “snitch” or “rat” would be uttered by Belichick, Brady or the coaches. It isn’t necessary.\n“Some guys might say something within their group, or individually, but I doubt it’ll be addressed by the team,” said Light. “It’ll be an intense week. But this is more of a natural feeling in the room, like being out in the desert and needing a drink, than having someone stand up and say, ‘Let’s kick their ass because they did us wrong.’ ”\nHarrison agreed.\n“Look, everyone in that locker room knows what happened. And everybody knows what Tom Brady went through,” Harrison said, “and if I’m in that locker room, Tom is my quarterback. I’m pissed off. As a player, I’m even more motivated, because (the Colts) caused all the pain and anxiety and everything with Tom.\n“We lost draft picks. Those draft picks don’t just affect the owner, it affects the players, too. That’s a first-round draft pick that can help you. So you take it personally as a player.”\nThere have been past situations the team has taken personally.\nWhen Eagles receiver Freddie Mitchell said he couldn’t name members of the Patriots secondary prior to Super Bowl XXXIX, a secondary that didn’t include an injured Ty Law , the lack of respect provided motivational fuel in an eventual 24-21 win.\nIt was the same effect when Steelers safety Anthony Smith boldly guaranteed a victory in Foxboro in 2007. It was no accident Brady repeatedly targeted and ultimately embarrassed Smith in a 34-13 rout.\nAs if the obvious Deflategate implications were not enough, some Colts players refused to refer to the Patriots by name, which is a sign of disrespect.\n“If someone’s personally attacking us, like a Freddie Mitchell, or you hear someone talking trash, yes, that serves as motivation, that’s only natural. It serves as motivation,” Harrison said. “If someone says, ‘I’m going to burn you,’ or “I’m going to get your quarterback,’ or like Greg Hardy said, or whatever he said about Tom Brady and his wife, that’s going to piss you off because you’ve got pride and you’re a grown man. If you don’t get mad and upset about stuff like that, you don’t have any type of pride and more than likely, you’re not going to be a New England Patriot for a long time. So of course that stuff matters. ”\nThe game has been hyped to the hilt as a revenge game. Perhaps, that works on both sides. The Colts haven’t been able to come up off the mat in the four tries with Andrew Luck at quarterback.\nSomehow, tight end Dwayne Allen thinks not calling the Patriots by name will change their luck.\nSaid Harrison: “Nothing good comes playing against the Patriots if you’re talking trash. These idiots across the league don’t realize you cannot trash talk to Tom Brady and the Patriots. Whoever does, doesn’t have success.”\nMcGinest anticipates the team will be ready to go, and ready to issue payback.\n“Did you see Brady last week spiking the ball and yelling in the end zone in Dallas? He’s fired up,” McGinest said. “I don’t think you can get any more animated or fired up than that. All these guys feel that. They feel like people don’t respect what they did last year, and everything they had to go through in the offseason, even though they dominated that (Indy) game in the second half, 28-0, after the balls were confiscated, people still had something to say.\n“I’m sure from ownership on down, from the coaches to the players, it’s very competitive with Indianapolis. It’s always been. Now, throw in a lot of smart people in the media picking Indy to be in the Super Bowl before the season started. Talk about motivation. . . . What else do you need to hear?”\nA prediction?\n“It’s hard to imagine they won’t dismantle the Colts,” said Light, who flew his “InflationNation” raffle winner, Matthew Moniz of Rhode Island, to Indy for the game with proceeds benefitting Light’s youth foundation. “I just have a hard time believing the Colts will be able to keep up.”\nPatriots must Solder on\nIt’s a major blow to any team to lose its blind side protector for the season. It happened in Denver with Ryan Clady before training camp even opened. It has happened with other teams.\nNow the Patriots face the same challenge. How will they survive the loss of left tackle Nate Solder ?\n“If any team can afford to lose an offensive lineman, it’s them,” Harrison said of the Pats. “They’ll adjust. They’ve done it. They’ve lost key players, from Tom (Brady), to me . . . other guys. This is the one team that knows how to make adjustments. And Josh ( McDaniels , the offensive coordinator) does a good job offensively. He’s got so many different weapons, so many different things he can do offensively to offset that pass rush. So I don’t think it’s the end of the world. It’s just the next-man-up mentality.”\nFifth-year offensive lineman Marcus Cannon is the likely replacement unless they choose to move Sebastian Vollmer from right tackle. Light believes Cannon would be fine this game. The Colts don’t have much of a pass rush. He’d be tested more the following weeks against the Jets and Dolphins, who have elite pass rushers coming off the edge.\n“He’s going to have to grow up a lot,” Light said of Cannon. “It’s a challenge week to week, having that role. Physically, I think Marcus can handle a lot. He’s going to have to hone in on a lot of little things.”\nBowles’ Island in the sun\nAsked Thursday by the New York media if there is anything that surprised him about Darrelle Revis , now that he’s spent some time around him, Jets coach Todd Bowles had an interesting take.\n“I don’t know if I had any preconceived notions on him. I knew he was a good football player. I watched him over the years,” Bowles said. “Mostly, personally, his personality that blends in with the other guys and him playing like he’s still 22, 23 years old and just his love of the game, and the way he prepares is more impressive than him actually playing.”\nWatkins feeling Buffaloed\nOne of Rex Ryan ’s Bills players spouted off about how unhappy he is with his role in the offense. Sammy Watkins aired his grievances in the Buffalo News last week.\n“Everybody looks at you getting zero catches, zero yards, but when you look on film, 90 percent of the time you’re open,” Watkins said. “I need the ball at least 10 times — I need 10 targets — and I’ll be fine with however many yards I get.”\nWatkins, who has missed some time due to injury, has seven catches for 99 yards and one touchdown in three games. The Buffalo News report added that Watkins had his agent, Eugene Parker , speak with people in the Bills organization about his concerns.\nSaid Watkins: “We reached out to a couple people and tried to pull some strings like, ‘Hey, I need my targets. You came up to draft me and I’m not getting targets — that’s a problem. You’re making me look bad and you’re making yourself look bad. Why not make both of us look good?’ ”\nWatkins sounds like a typical diva receiver. He wants the ball. Until the Bills get an elite quarterback, he probably won’t be satisfied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:36:32.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
