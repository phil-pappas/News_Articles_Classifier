He’s the heart and soul of our offense and he really grinded it out.”\nCassidy finished with 224 yards on 34 carries for the Grey Ghosts, though his score did not seal the win, but an interception with 2:30 left by Eric Jacobsen did before Cassidy had some big runs to run out the clock.\n“(Anthony DeNitto) is one of the best receivers in the state,” Gagne said. “It was a good ball and (Jacobsen) had position. He’s a competitor and he went up and made the play.”\nNewton South (5-1) scored to begin the first half after a 15-play drive that ate up 7:34 off the clock. Junior Austin Burton found DeNitto on third-and-7 for an 11-yard score to put the Lions up 14-7.\nWestford Academy (5-0) did not go away and answered with an 11-play drive capped by Cassidy’s second touchdown to knot the score at 14-14 with 9:05 left to play.\nThe Grey Ghosts would show even more resiliency on defense by forcing a punt after just four offensive plays.\n“I tell them all the time ‘You’ve got to play a complete football game,’ ” Gagne said. “’You’ve got to have a next play mentality.’”\nBurton finished 17-for-34 with 191 yards, two touchdown passes and two picks in the losing effort for Newton South.\nIn the first half, Westford Academy got on the board on its first possession that included 60 yards on the ground from Cassidy, including the 33-yard score with 7:17 left in the quarter. Cassidy finished the half with 86 yards on 16 carries.\nAfter forcing the Grey Ghosts to punt early in the second quarter, the Lions responded with their first score on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Burton to senior Frankie Barros to knot the score at 7-7.\nThe catch capped a 14-play, 87-yard drive, including a 38-yard pass from Burton to Barros on a second-and-17 play from the Westford Academy 44-yard line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:48:06.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
