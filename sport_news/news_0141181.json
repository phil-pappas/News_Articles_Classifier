A snow-making system also still needs to be completed. \nMen’s race director Markus Waldner says “the concrete is there, they are working 24 hours, seven days. The last update we got was that they meet the timeline.” \nWaldner adds “we have no doubt but we know there are delays. We push the organizers. On paper it works, in reality we’ll see.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:00:31.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
