It wasn't meant to be.\" \nDavid Price is scheduled to start Game 1 of the Blue Jays' AL Division series Thursday at home against AL West champion Texas. Toronto ended the regular season at 93-69, a 10-game improvement over last season. \nIt didn't come as a surprise that Buehrle will not be on the active roster for the Rangers series. \n\"They've already talked to me,\" Buehrle said. \"It's tough. We've had four guys throwing (the ball well). They made the right decision.\" \nBuerhle also said he has not decided if he will be retiring. \n\"I don't know what's going to happen,\" Buerhle said. \"I'm going to go home and talk with my wife. We'll figure it out and let you guys know in a couple months.\" \nTwo errors led to Buehrle allowing eight unearned runs and five hits over a career-low two-thirds of an inning. He had gone 6 2-3 innings Friday night en route to his 15th win. \n\"You could argue he's been as valuable as any pitcher in baseball for the last 15 years,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \"He's so efficient, and you hear his teammates talk about him and what he's done.\" \nChris Colabello and Darwin Barney homered for the Blue Jays, who needed a win and a Kansas City loss to finish with the AL's best record. \nJoey Butler homered twice and had six RBIs for Rays. \nTampa Bay's first run off Buehrle scored when first baseman Edwin Encarnacion dropped Steven Souza Jr's soft liner for the Blue Jays' second error in a span of five batters. \nTim Beckham drew a two-out bases-loaded walk and Butler hit a grand slam on an 85 mph offering — the fastest of Buehrle's 45 pitches — to make it 6-0. The slam came after a close call by plate umpire Alfonso Marquez went against Buehrle on a 2-2 pitch. \nManager John Gibbons took Buehrle out after Brandon Guyer's RBI single. \nMikie Mahtook completed the Rays' nine-run first with a two-run homer off Ryan Tepera. Butler had a two-run shot during a three-run fifth. \nColabello hit a solo drive in the fourth, and Barney had a two-run ninth-inning drive. \nMatt Moore (3-4) gave up one run and four hits over six innings for the Rays, who went 80-82 under first-year manager Kevin Cash. Tampa Bay was 77-85 last year with current Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon. \nThe Rays finished with an MLB-low home attendance of 1,247,668 after drawing 15,815 on Sunday. Tampa Bay drew 1,446,464 last season. \nMLB-low home attendance of 1,247,668 after drawing 15,815 on Sunday.
