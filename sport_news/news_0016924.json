The Bears have played better as of late, and Forte is doing his usual thing. He has surpassed 100 yards from scrimmage in four of the team’s games, and the one he didn’t was the game started by Jimmy Clausen . The Lions have allowed the seventh-most points per game to running backs. Get ready for Johnson’s breakout game in the 2015 season. He has faced some of the toughest pass defenses in the league, including the Broncos, Seahawks and Cardinals. The Bears don’t quite measure up to those groups. Matthew Stafford’s deep-ball struggles are a minor concern, but you know Johnson is good for a nine-catch, 165-yard, two-touchdown game eventually. Don’t be surprised if this is it. The Lions have allowed touchdowns to opposing tight ends in four of their five games this season, which bodes well for Bennett.\nFantasy Video Fact or Fiction: Assessing Mike Evans and Calvin Johnson’s slow starts by Michael Beller", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Mbeller"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:21:53.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
