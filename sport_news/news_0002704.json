He is athletic, smart, a hard worker, and arguably the greatest football player of all time. But the Hall of Famer sure has a selective memory, not to mention a lack of modesty. \nRice was tweeting while watching the Saints-Falcons game on Thursday night and noted that Atlanta was making several mistakes, such as dropped passes. He then sent a tweet denying ever using the substance “Stickum” to help him catch balls: Never used Stickum ! Don't blame me for dropped footballs. My work effort speaks for itself . #Goat \n— Jerry Rice (@JerryRice) October 16, 2015 \nOnce again Rice denies ever using Stickum, an illegal adhesive substance that made it easier for players to catch balls. It’s pretty absurd that he continues to deny using Stickum considering there is video evidence of him admitting to the contrary . \nAlso notice the hashtag on that tweet.”Goat” is an acronym for “greatest of all time.” \nRice’s career marks — 1,549 catches, 22,895 yards, and 197 touchdowns — certainly speak for themselves. It’s hard to imagine his receiving records will ever be broken, even in this age of pass-happy offenses. But is he better than other legends of the game like Jim Brown? Or if you want to go way back in time, one could argue that Don Hutson was a better wide receiver. Nevertheless, Rice still calls himself the GOAT. \nAdmitting that he used a substance that would enhance his ability to catch passes certainly would hurt his claim to being the greatest, so of course he’s going to continue to deny it.
