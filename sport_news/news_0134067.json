Each year, hundreds of local girls start their own small businesses through the Fall Product Program, offering gourmet food items and magazine subscriptions to community members. New this year are a delectable assortment of Dark Chocolate Caramel Caps dusted with sea salt and a sweet-and-salty Honey Mustard Pretzel Mix. All gourmet snacks are under $8, and there are eight gluten-free items customers can enjoy. After last year's success, Girl Scouts has decided to again offer customers the opportunity to order items through the Online Nut Store. Customers can order, pay, and receive direct shipments of nuts and candy with girls receiving full credit for the purchase. Customers are not restricted to the 12 items on a girl's order card but can choose from over 15 additional items, including corporate gifts. Interested customers can ask a Girl Scout for an order form or an evite to her Online Nut Store. To be connected to a local Girl Scout, customers can call GSNI's Product Program hotline at (800) 242-5591, ext. 7250, or email orders to info@girlscoutsni.org where they will be filled and delivered by a local Girl Scout! Girl Scouts are again proudly supporting Gift of Caring Project Share though the Fall Product Program. If customers don't want to purchase items as gifts or for themselves, they can donate to the military in $5 increments. A $5 donation purchases one nut or candy item and four $5 donations purchases one magazine subscription for a military service member. All candy, nuts, and subscriptions are ordered virtually by girls and donated directly to the military. Girls who receive two $5 donations toward the Gift of Caring Project Share earn a colorful Share Patch for their commitment to our military. Everyone knows about the Girl Scout Cookie Program, but do you know about the Fall Product Program? Through the Fall Product Program, local Girl Scouts offer gourmet snack items and magazines to their communities. The money earned through this program helps troops get started in the fall, long before the Girl Scout Cookie Program. Both programs teach girls important skills and help troops fund activities and service projects. Plus, Girl Scout product programs differ from traditional fundraisers by encouraging girls to work together to decide how to spend troop funds! Girls learn five valuable life skills through participation in Fall Product Program. They set personal goals for themselves and a troop goal to achieve what they want to do as a group. They use decision-making skills to provide input on how to maximize sales and spend troop proceeds. They hone people skills by learning how to talk to, listen to, and interact with different types of people while gaining an understanding of the importance of customer service. By managing money, girls get a better sense of counting change properly and ensuring a check is completed correctly. Lastly, they learn about business ethics. Girls gain an understanding of how important it is to be honest, meet deadlines, and properly market a product. We're Girl Scouts of Northern Illinois We're 20,000 strong -- 15,000 girls and 5,000 adults who believe every girl can change the world. Our girls develop leadership skills in 16 counties including parts or all of Boone, Carroll, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Jo Daviess, Kane, Kendall, Lake, LaSalle, Lee, McHenry, Ogle, Stephenson, Whiteside, and Winnebago. We help girls build courage, confidence, and character, so they can make the world a better place by inspiring them to discover their inner strength, talents, and passions. And with programs from Stomp Rockets to Camp Explorers, there's a chance for every girl to do something amazing! We're Girl Scouts of Northern Illinois.
