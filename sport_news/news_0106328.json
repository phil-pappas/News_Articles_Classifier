(Nam Y. Huh/AP) \nIf you need proof that sports customs vary throughout the world, contemplate this comparison: Earlier this month, Formula 1 racer Lewis Hamilton got away with spraying champagne on Russia President Vladimir Putin after winning the Russian Grand Prix; meanwhile, MLB is reportedly contemplating whether to punish teams who spray their fans, most of whom aren’t presidents. \n[ Russian President gets champagne shower thanks to Hamilton ] \nThis news comes courtesy of ESPN’s Arash Markazi , who reported Thursday that MLB sent around a memo last month warning teams to keep their liquor in the clubhouse after big wins and not in the faces of their fans. \n“We set out for these celebrations to be held in a private, controlled setting with limitations and safeguards in place,” said MLB Chief Communications Officer Pat Courtney. “Our policy explicitly states that no alcohol is permitted outside of the clubhouse or at any time on the field of play, and that all celebrations involving the use of alcohol must take place within the clubhouse.” (Elsa/Getty Images) \nPhotographic evidence of teams violating those rules, however, is not hard to find. Not to mention, according to Courtney, MLB security is always on hand to witness the events. The blatant violations are now apparently making Commissioner Rob Manfred have to think about becoming a party pooper. \n“The commissioner determines the appropriate steps if any individuals violate our rules,” Courtney said. \nSo far, violating teams have only received warnings, Markazi reports, but punishments could be on the way for repeat violators. The big concern is there might be minors in the stands. \n“Things have gone beyond where they’re supposed to,” a league source told ESPN. “You just have to turn on the TV and can see it.” \nThe Mets, who clinched a spot in the World Series on Wednesday by defeating the Chicago Cubs to win the National League Championship Series, are the latest violators. If New York goes on to win the World Series against either the Kansas City Royals or the Toronto Blue Jays and the crowd gets showered in champagne again, we’ll have to wait to see what Manfred says.
