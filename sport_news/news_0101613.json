He attacked the Bihar Chief Minister over the “tantrik” controversy and said the RJD chief was leading the “Rashtriya Jadu-tona Dal”. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar later hit back dubbing Modi an “autocrat”and said he and BJP chief Amit Shah had been rattled by feedback of an imminent defeat in the Bihar polls. Modi addressed four public rallies in the state today. He launched a verbal attack on Lalu and Nitish saying they sacrificed pigeons, but that would hardly have any effect on the youth of Bihar. “We need no black magic; we need development and so do the youth of Bihar. We want a developed Bihar,” he said addressing a rally at Nalanda, Nitish’s home district. “The grand alliance (mahagathbandhan) is actually a swarthbandhan (selfishness alliance). Nitish levelled serious charges against Lalu in the past, but now they have formed an alliance in greed for the power. Earlier, the grand alliance had three partners—RJD, JD(U) and Congress—but now it has got the fourth ally—a tantrik,” he said. Modi urged voters to repose faith in the NDA this time. He said: “You give us two-thirds majority and we will give you a developed Bihar.” He put forth his six-point agenda for the development of the state. “We have a three-point agenda for the welfare of the state with focus on roads, electricity and water supply. The other three-point agenda aimed at family welfare, including padhai (education) and kamai (employment) for the youth and dawai (medicine) for the old ones.” During a rally at Marhaura in Saran district, Modi said if the NDA came to power, industrialisation would be a thrust area. Talking of the financial package of 1.25 lakh crore for the state, he said: “If the RJD chief is asked to write down the package figure, he will not be sure on the number of zeros to be written for that.” The PM also made a strong rebuttal of the attempts by the Opposition to paint the BJP as anti-reservation, saying it was a “bundle of lies” and promised “no one can even touch” the provisions made with the efforts of Dalit icon BR Ambedkar for the uplift of the deprived classes.
