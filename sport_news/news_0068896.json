Leaf on a visit this weekend.\nLeaf originally pledged to the Arizona Wildcats, but de-committed in early August.\n\"This is definitely one of the hardest decisions of my life but I have decided to decommit from Arizona and reopen my recruitment,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"The school and staff of Arizona have been great to me and I have nothing but respect for Coach Miller and the entire staff and wish them nothing but the best. But at this point in my life I know it is best to explore my options and pursue other basketball opportunities.\"\nAccording to indihoops.com, Leaf is now considering a top six of Kansas, Louisville, North Carolina, Oregon, San Diego State and UCLA:\nTJ Leaf - Foothills Christian @Compton_Magic down to SDSU Kansas Lousiville Oregon UCLA North Carolina @Tyleaf_22 pic.twitter.com/hf8ehkv1yk\nâ€” Indivisible Hoops (@IndiHoops) September 30, 2015\nLast season, Leaf averaged 27.4 points, 14.2 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 1.8 steals and 2.7 blocks per game on his way to leading Foothills Christian High School to the San Diego Section Division II championship and earning the Division II Player of the Year award.\nThe 6-foot-9, 220-pound big man, out of El Cajon, California, is rated by ESPN as the No. 13 player in the country , while Rivals lists him at No. 15 .\nOregon already has commitments from four-star point guard Payton Pritchard , four-star small forward Keith Small and four-star power forward M.J. Cage , the son of former NBA star Michael Cage, but has a chance to sign a top-five class nationally if the Ducks can add Leaf.\nFirst, of course, Oregon will need to impress Leaf on his visit this weekend.\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4qOKYeR-rCQ", "http://oregon.247sports.com/Bolt/5-Star-Power-Forward-Will-Visit-Oregon-This-Weekend-40036170", "http://247sports.com/Season/2016-Basketball/CompositeTeamRankings", "http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/171474/tj-leaf", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGFqJ69WAzU", "https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec", "https://twitter.com/Compton_Magic", "http://t.co/hf8ehkv1yk", "https://twitter.com/IndiHoops/status/649270189247217666", "http://sports.yahoo.com/usc/basketball/recruiting/player-T.J.-Leaf-145658", "https://twitter.com/Tyleaf_22"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:12:44.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
