We don't want to lose him. I've told many people at Auburn, you'd be crazy not to hire this guy. But I'm going to be the happiest guy in the world if you don't.\" \nA key ingredient to Mississippi State's rebuilding project and its run to the national finals in 2013, he also helped build successful programs at Georgia, Auburn and Mississippi State as an assistant. \nHe worked at Auburn from 2006 through 2008 and built three recruiting classes ranked in the top 18, including a top 5 class in 2007 that led to coach John Pawlowski's trip to a regional in 2010. Thompson has coached 22 All-Americans on the Division I level. \nThompson was named Baseball America's assistant coach of the year in 2014 and has developed 23 non-drafted players out of high school into draftees in college. His pitching staff led the SEC with a 2.58 ERA, which was the second-best mark in the nation in 2012. \nThompson is a familiar face in Alabama, where he has coached at Huntingdon College (1993) in Montgomery, Birmingham-Southern (1994-96, 1998-2001), Georgia (2002-05) and Auburn (2006-08) before joining John Cohen at MSU in 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:59:18.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
