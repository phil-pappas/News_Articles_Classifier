Shortly thereafter, he made the unusual choice to withdraw from UCLA and focus on preparing for the 2016 NFL draft. Though the decision was largely fueled by his football future, Jack said academic considerations also weighed heavily.\n“I didn’t want my GPA to suffer,” said Jack, who was injured two days before he was to begin the fall quarter of his junior season at UCLA. “I definitely want to come back and get my degree, that’s for sure going to happen.”\nAs he underwent surgery and began rehabbing the knee while dealing with his temporary immobility, Jack quickly fell behind in his anthropology classes. He also worried that his eligibility for the Bruins’ 2016 season could be jeopardized as he attempted to juggle his various responsibilities. So he took the books off his plate.\n“I’d rather be playing right now, honestly. I’d rather be playing and be with my teammates and my brothers,” said Jack, who hopes to “chip away” at his degree again next summer.\n“But this how my life went, and this is my situation.”\nAnd actually, it might not be a bad one in the long run.\nJack was widely considered a first-round prospect entering the 2015 season. Sure, he loses a year to impress scouts. But now his grades won’t suffer, he’ll have extra time to rehab — he’s scheduled to report to the Fischer Institute in Phoenix on Nov. 1 and turn his rehab over to Brett Fischer, the physical therapist for the Arizona Cardinals — and the rest of his body should be fresh for 2016. Most rookies hit a wall as they go from their final college campaign to combine training, and then into the NFL.\nAnd since Jack isn’t coming back from a more serious injury, like a torn anterior cruciate ligament — which St. Louis Rams tailback Todd Gurley dealt with last year while coming out of Georgia — his draft stock isn’t likely to suffer much, it at all.\nAsked if Jack will still go in Round 1 next spring, CBSSports draft analyst Rob Rang told USA TODAY Sports: “Absolutely, even with the injury.”\nRang regards Jack as “just a phenomenal talent, one of those players that is just a unique athlete.”\nThat kind of ability allowed Jack to play linebacker (inside and outside), nickel corner, safety, running back and even kick returner for UCLA. It’s a skill set similar to the Carolina Panthers’ Shaq Thompson, who was a two-way player at Washington before being drafted in the first round this year as a linebacker.\nRang foresees a similar path for Jack, whom he says is a superior athlete to Thompson, especially given the devaluation of running backs in the NFL.\n“You’re looking for more defensive players who have the versatility not only to be able to affect the quarterback and stop the running game but also drop into coverage,” Rang said. “And that’s one of the areas I think that Jack stands out. I believe he’s one of the game’s defensive erasers.”\nJack projects as an outside linebacker for a 4-3 defensive team but would likely play inside in a 3-4 scheme. His athleticism and instincts likely mean he’ll be a three-down player. He doesn’t care where he plays as long as he is playing.\n“I’m open to anything,” he said. “I’ll leave it up to everybody else, I’m flexible and can do anything.\n“Defense is my preference, but I wouldn’t say a specific position.”\nBut for now, Jack is content to continue getting healthy — he said “the knee is doing well” — and is enjoying the company of his former teammates in Los Angeles for the remainder of the month. Then it’s on to the serious business with Fischer with the goal of being ready to participate fully in the NFL scouting combine and UCLA’s pro day early next year.\nAfter that? Hopefully he’ll be making a splash with his new team similar to Gurley (305 rushing yards the past two weeks).\n“Guys like that give me hope. He took a similar route to me, and he’s doing just fine,” Jack said.\n“I feel like I made the right decision, because if they can do it, I can do it as well.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:48:11.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
