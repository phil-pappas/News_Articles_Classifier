Two other top players — quarterback Tyrod Taylor and receiver Sammy Watkins — are questionable.\nMcCoy has missed each of the past two weeks after a setback at practice. He originally hurt his left hamstring at training camp Aug. 18. He is listed as probable.\n\"I look forward to playing,\" McCoy said. \"When my number's called, I'm going to be out there looking to make plays. ... \"\nMcCoy has yet to make a major impact after coming to Buffalo in a blockbuster trade with the Philadelphia Eagles for linebacker Kiko Alonso . In three games, he has 146 yards on 43 carries. The Bills are without rookie running back Karlos Williams , who is recovering from a concussion.\nTaylor will be a game-time decision, said coach Rex Ryan . Taylor was limited at practice for a third straight day Friday. He sprained a knee ligament in Sunday's 14-13 win over Tennessee.\nJets: Linebacker David Harris , right guard Willie Colon and running back Bilal Powell are questionable for New York's game against Washington on Sunday because of injuries. Despite the injury report designation Friday, coach Todd Bowles says Harris, who was limited all week with a strained quadriceps, should play without restrictions.\nBrowns: Backup quarterback Johnny Manziel admitted to police he drank alcohol before a dispute Monday with his girlfriend while driving on a highway. Manziel was parked in a gravel driveway when Avon, Ohio, police located him following the incident with girlfriend Colleen Crowley . A witness told police Crowley was attempting to exit Manziel's speeding vehicle as he tried to keep her in the car. Police said Manziel told them he had two alcoholic drinks earlier in the day. Manziel wasn't charged and Crowley told police she didn't want to press charges. Manziel spent 70 days in a Pennsylvania rehab facility during the off-season for treatment of an unspecified condition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:22:36.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
