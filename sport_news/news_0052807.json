In the meantime, there’s plenty to talk about, so let’s check in on our daily wrap-up of news items from around the league. \nOne of the more notable injury items from yesterday was the status of Seahawks RB Marshawn Lynch. He’s been ruled out for Week 5 with his calf/hamstring issues. Lynch should be able to get back on the field next weekend, but in the meantime look for Thomas Rawls and Fred Jackson (if he plays; he’s questionable) to fill in. \nUSA TODAY Sports \nSteelers fans will want to keep an eye on Martavis Bryant in practice today. We’ll likely get a clearer picture on his status for Monday’s game after today’s session. Bryant hasn’t put in a full day of practice since Monday and could end up sitting out this week. \nThe 49ers will be without Vernon Davis for Week 5 against the Giants. It wouldn’t have surprised anyone if he’d been active for this one, but he’s been ruled out already with that knee injury. Davis probably would have done well against New York’s TE-friendly secondary, but he won’t get the chance. It’ll be more Garrett Celek this week. \nThe Cardinals look like they’re going to be getting RB Andre Ellington back tomorrow. He’s probable with that knee injury. Ellington has missed three straight weeks due to a sprained PCL, but he’ll have to take a backseat behind starter Chris Johnson , who has flourished in Ellington’s absence. \nTexans backup RB Alfred Blue is reportedly dealing with a turf toe issue. He’s classified as day-to-day, but probably won’t miss any time. \nAaron Rodgers continues to lose wide receivers up in Green Bay. This time, it’s Davante Adams . He’s currently questionable with an ankle injury. Most sources feel like Adams is more on the side of sitting out for Week 5 against the Rams, so we’d be somewhat surprised to see him out there tomorrow. \nNFL Week 5 Schedule: Let’s take a look at the upcoming round of games on the NFL schedule, along with the times and TV networks you can catch them on. \nBye Week: Panthers, Dolphins, Jets, Vikings \nThursday, October 8, 2015: \nColts at Texans (CBS, NFL Network) \nSunday, October 11, 2015: \nChicago Bears at Kansas City Chiefs (FOX)Seattle Seahawks at Cincinnati Bengals (FOX)Washington Redskins at Atlanta Falcons (FOX)Jacksonville Jaguars at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (CBS)New Orleans Saints at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)Cleveland Browns at Baltimore Ravens (CBS)St. Louis Rams at Green Bay Packers (CBS)Buffalo Bills at Tennessee Titans (CBS) \n4:05 PM ET: Arizona Cardinals at Detroit Lions (FOX) \n4:25 PM ET: New England Patriots at Dallas Cowboys (CBS)Denver Broncos at Oakland Raiders (CBS) \n8:30 PM ET: San Francisco 49ers at New York Giants (NBC) \nMonday, October 12, 2015: \nPittsburgh Steelers at San Diego Chargers (ESPN) \nFor the latest article updates, follow Andrew on Twitter @SCPAndrew.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:42:40.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
