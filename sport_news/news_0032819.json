(AP) - Attorneys for New Hampshire's only death row inmate are challenging the constitutionality of the state's death penalty law.\nIn a recently filed motion, lawyers for Michael Addison argue that the two methods of execution allowed by New Hampshire - lethal injection and hanging - violate the state and federal constitution, including the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. They argue the drugs needed for lethal injection are unavailable and would inflict pain and suffering.\nThe motion was first reported by New Hampshire Public Radio.\nAddison was sentenced to death for the 2006 killing of a Manchester police officer. The state Supreme Court upheld his sentence in April.\nNew Hampshire's last execution was in 1939. It has no designated facility for them.\nThe state hasn't yet filed a response.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:37:46.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
