He completed 21 of 30 attempts for 233 yards and two TDs in the second half, again tormenting the Jets. Including postseason, Brady is 22-6 as a starting QB against Gang Green. Brady, who became the fifth player in NFL history to pass for 55,000 yards in a career, overcame numerous drops by his receiving corps. \nCostly mistakes \nNew England DE Chandler Jones' strip sack of Ryan Fitzpatrick on the Jets' second play from scrimmage led to Stephen Gostkowski's 38-yard field goal. … New England WR Julian Edelman dropped a perfect Brady pass in the third quarter, costing the Patriots a TD. They settled for a field goal. … A missed blocking assignment by the Patriots allowed Jets OLB Calvin Pace to come in untouched and sack Brady for an 8-yard loss on third down in the second quarter, leading to a Gostkowski field goal. … Jets WR Brandon Marshall dropped a potential TD pass in the fourth quarter, leading to a Nick Folk field goal. \nEye-catching \nBoth teams successfully challenged incorrect spots of the ball by the officials in the second quarter, negating first downs by the opponent. The Jets wound up with a fourth down and had to punt. The Patriots had a third-and-1, which set up the sack by the unblocked Pace. … New England rushed the ball only nine times, and Brady was the Pats' leading ballcarrier with 15 yards and a TD on four attempts. … Jets CB Buster Skrine leveled Edelman on a second-quarter catch that was nullified by a New England holding penalty, but Skrine himself suffered an elbow injury while delivering the hit. He left the game but returned later. \nCoaching decisions \nJets coach Todd Bowles and offensive coordinator Chan Gailey showed very little confidence in the veteran Fitzpatrick near the end of the first half. With 1:56 remaining, the Jets took over at their own 19 with all their timeouts, but they called three conservative plays and chose not to take any shots downfield before punting. Perhaps the motivation was not to leave Brady much time, and they didn't. New England got the ball with 12 seconds to go and didn't score. … Bowles called no timeouts during New England's final TD drive, allowing the Pats to run the clock down to 1:13 remaining in the game. \nLooking ahead \nThe Jets (4-2) will play their second straight road game, visiting Oakland (3-3) at 4:05 p.m. Sunday. The Raiders are coming off a 37-29 win over San Diego in which second-year QB Derek Carr threw three TD passes. Carr made his NFL debut in a 19-14 loss to the Jets on opening day last season. Carr threw two TD passes in that contest. \n— J.P.
