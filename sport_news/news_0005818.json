He said he felt the hamstring grab while he was rounding second, and manager Joe Maddon said the rookie had a moderate strain.

Hopefully if everything plays properly and we have another opportunity to play in another round he might be available at that time, but for sure not this one.\" \nMaddon said they haven't made a decision on who Russell's replacement on this roster against the Los Angeles Dodgers or New York Mets, which must be submitted by Saturday morning. \nBaez replaced Russell in the NLDS, and hit a three-run homer in Chicago's series-ending 6-4 victory in Game 4. The 22-year-old slugger has big-time power, but he has struck out a lot during his brief time in the majors.

I want to believe that Javy is arriving at that same point,\" Maddon said. \"I think to hit a three-run homer in a playoff game like that against one of the best pitchers in the National League should boost your confidence.\" \nAfter Lester pitches in the pener, Jake Arrieta will go in Game 2 on Sunday night. Lester is 6-5 with a 2.66 ERA in 15 career postseason games, including 13 starts. \nArrieta threw a five-hit shutout in the wild-card game at Pittsburgh but had his worst start in months when he allowed four runs in 5 2-3 innings in Game 3 against the Cardinals. Lester hasn't pitched since the NLDS opener last Friday.

The right-hander threw a side session Thursday and said he is fine. \n\"I think the playoff atmosphere can drain you of energy mentally and you spend a lot of brain power throughout the day contemplating things, thinking about different scenarios and it can be taxing, and sometimes that'll translate into some physical fatigue,\" he said.
