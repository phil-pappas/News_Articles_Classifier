When he's on the floor, he'll be a focal point.\nBut what happens when he's not on the floor? Of all the questions about Utah, this one is the biggest. \nLast year's squad had maybe better depth at center than any other position. Behind Poeltl was Dallin Bachynski, who was a capable starter if needed and a 7-foot bruiser. Jeremy Olsen didn't play a lot of minutes, but he was an available 6-foot-10 body in a pinch.\n  Bachynski graduated, Olsen retired, and Utah's biggest offseason addition is Granger freshman Makol Mawien. At 6-foot-9, Mawien has length, but is still packing on muscle.\nIn short: Utah isn't as big as it used to be.\nThe Utes are doing their best to add weight, and there may not be a better poster boy than Kyle Kuzma. The Michigan native came in to the program at roughly 205, but has gained 15 pounds since. He eats at all hours — trading fast food for grilled chicken breasts — and has spent time in the weight room.\nBrekkott Chapman, Chris Reyes and Mawien have also seen gains this offseason, trying to stay mean while getting a little less lean.\n\"Bigger and stronger,\" Reyes said. \"I've added five pounds of muscle. You look at the other guys, they're adding weight, too. Good weight.\"\nBut weight alone won't always account for the size differential. The Utes play a handful of talented bigs this year: Oregon's shot-blocking specialist 6-foot-9 Jordan Bell; Cal's potential diaper dandy 6-foot-10 Ivan Rabb; UCLA's junkyard dog 6-foot-9 Tony Parker; and Arizona's 7-footer Kaleb Tarczewski.\nA favorite to be selected in the lottery of the 2016 NBA Draft, Poeltl may be as good or better than all of them. But Poeltl probably won't average 40 minutes per game, either.\nAt the moment, Reyes may be Utah's best backup at the moment, and the 6-foot-7 forward is ready if he's called upon. The finger injury in his shooting hand is healed, and he finally feels like he's conditioned to play at altitude. He was Utah's least productive starter last year, averaging 4.3 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. But he thinks he could take a leap as a junior.\n\"I'm trying to do what I do as a 4, and try to bring 5s out to the perimeter and spread the floor,\" he said. \"I feel like I'm quicker a lot of the 5s in our league, so that could be an advantage.\"\nPlayers say feeding the post and leaning on Poeltl's ability will be a huge part of any success this year. Krystkowiak said Poeltl's shooting touch and go-to moves are improving.\nBut with him off the floor, fans may see more small ball. Kuzma has bulked up, and so has Chapman. They're better acquainted to the physicality of college play. They could play together as posts.\n\"We could spread it out with me and Brekkott,\" Kuzma said. \"It's all about rebounding. If we can rebound at a high level, that's what matters. We can play a little smaller.\"\nOf course, no one knows for sure how it will work. Mawien may be game-ready to play center. Reyes may play less four and more five. Poeltl's foul troubles, prevalent last year, may dry up, allowing him to play more minutes.\nUntil they know for sure how much the size mismatches will play into their games, the Utes will prepare for anything. And because they're smaller doesn't mean they're acting like it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:07:36.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
