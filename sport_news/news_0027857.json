You just never know what’s going to happen.” \nThat mindset will serve Southeastern well as it faces one of the toughest final three weeks not just in the Ohio Heritage Conference, but in all of high school football. \nSoutheastern (2-5) hosts Greeneview (5-2) tonight and finishes on the road at West Liberty-Salem (5-2) and Mechanicsburg (7-0). All three opponents currently hold playoff spots. \nGreeneview is No. 4 in the Division V, Region 18 computer points. Mechanicsburg is No. 3 and West Liberty-Salem is No. 6 in D-VI, Region 22. \nAnd should Bonifay’s words ring true — “You just never know what’s going to happen” — then the Trojans could vault up the D-VII, Region 26 standings themselves. Southeastern is No. 15 in the region. The top eight qualify for the postseason. \nWhat a rush: Kenton Ridge senior Jayden Davis closed the gap on Stebbins senior Mason Dyer for the Central Buckeye Conference rushing title. \nDavis rushed for 262 yards and three touchdowns on 21 carries in last week’s win at Shawnee. He had 266 yards and two TDs on 26 carries the week before in a win against Tecumseh. \nFor the season, Davis has 1,081 yards and 11 TDs on 124 attempts (8.7 yards per carry). He averages 154 yards per game. \nDyer, for comparison, has 1,176 yards on 136 carries (8.6 per carry). \nDavis has had two games with single-digit carries, including a two-carry game against Greenon. He scored on both attempts and finished with 34 yards. \nKenton Ridge hosts Bellefontaine tonight. \nDo-it-all Davis: Springfield junior Danny Davis continues to be one of the more versatile players in the Greater Western Ohio Conference, leading the league in all-purpose yards. \nEntering tonight’s game at Fairmont, Davis has 593 yards rushing, 528 receiving, 184 on punt returns and 124 on kickoff returns for a total of 1,429. \nTrotwood’s Raveion Hargrove is second with 1,279 yards (most coming from 1,161 yards rushing). \nDavis also has 13 of Springfield’s 20 touchdowns: six rushing, six receiving and one punt return.
