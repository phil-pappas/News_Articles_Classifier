By JOHN PERROTTOAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - Starling Marte's two-run homer in the bottom of the 12th inning gave the Pittsburgh Pirates a 6-4 victory over Cincinnati on Friday night, extending the Reds' losing streak to 13 games. \nThe Pirates (97-63) maintained a two-game lead over the Chicago Cubs for home-field advantage Wednesday night in the NL wild-card game. Pittsburgh can ensure the game is at PNC Park with a win in either of its two remaining games or one Cubs loss in Milwaukee. \nAndrew McCutchen had three hits for the Pirates, including a home run. \nGregory Polanco drew a one-out walk from Colin Balester (1-1) in the 12th. Marte hit the next pitch into the right-field stands for his 19th home run of the season and third career walk-off shot. He also hit a game-ending homer Aug. 22 against San Francisco.
