Unfortunately, two of the team's better players, Ashley Pabon, a senior, and junior Melisa Conguta, were lost for the rest of the season because of injury.

We Wear Pink for One of Our Own.\" \nAccording to Berthold, Vicki Campbell, the mother of Passaic Valley soccer player Kayla Campbell, is a breast cancer survivor and will be cancer-free for one year, as of Nov. 12. \n\"Vicki is the only mom in our program to go through this journey, so we highlighted her (last) name on the back of the shirts,\" said Berthold. \"In addition to announcing and presenting flowers to Mrs. Campbell, we are going to verbally recognize any aunt or grandmother that is a part of the team that has also battled, or lost the battle as a remembrance. \n\"We will be presenting flowers to them, if they can attend the game, or otherwise, we'll present them to the player, in honor of the women.\" \nBerthold also announced a few more plans for Friday. \n\"We are going to decorate the field with pink balloons and all the usual fun stuff,\" the coach said. \"I'm going to attempt to organize the girls in the shape of the (Breast Cancer Awareness) ribbon, on the field, and get an aerial picture.\" \nIf you know Kathleen Berthold, both as a Passaic Valley athlete from the late 1990's and now, as an educator and coach at her alma mater, this endeavor on Friday should come as no surprise. Kathleen is the epitome of Passaic Valley pride, with a big heart and wonderful Green and White spirit. \nAfter Friday's game, the team will stay home on Oct. 20 to face Wayne Valley, starting at 4 p.m. \nThe PV boys' soccer team was eliminated from the Passaic County Tournament last Saturday, losing in overtime to Wayne Valley, 2-1, in Little Falls in the quarterfinal round. \nThe Hornets were the top seed in the PCT, but fell short in a tough game. Zachary Fitzgerald scored the lone PV goal, off an assist by Phil Schirner. \nThe Hornets took a 7-4 record into a game with Wayne Hills earlier this week. On Oct. 16, it's off to Fair Lawn for a 4 p.m. game. On Oct. 20, the Hornets will visit Wayne Valley, also at 4 p.m. \nThe Homecoming festivities at Passaic Valley last Saturday were well done. Kudos to athletic director, Patty Lynch, for putting together the event. The weather was perfect, the crowd was very enthusiastic and the kids were tremendous. \nSorry to hear the normally fired up public address announcers, Rob Carcich and John Mazzo, a little laid back in their play-by-play of last Saturday's very exciting football game with West Milford. Missed hearing the out-of-town scores, too. Mazzo and Carcich have done, and continue to do, a great job bringing in some fun to the games, regardless of the score. Anyway, felt that should be mentioned. \nAlso, give football head coach Chet Parlavecchio credit. As ticked off as he was with the officiating in the second half of the game (which was bad, to say the least), the coach gave a passionate speech to his players, postgame, commending their effort to compete. \n\"Football is supposed to be fun,\" Chet said to his players. \"Did you have fun today? That was a good football game.\" \nChet gets it. Good for him.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:27:50.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
