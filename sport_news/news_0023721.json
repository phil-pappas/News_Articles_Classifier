Obama made the comments during an interview aired Sunday on CBS’s “60 Minutes.” “As a general proposition, when we’re in these offices, we have to be more sensitive and stay as far away from the line as possible when it comes to how we handle information, how we handle our own personal data,” Obama said. “And, you know, she made a mistake. She has acknowledged it.” The president also said he believed the controversy surrounding the issue was “ginned-up” by Republicans.

The committee’s chairman, Trey Gowdy, (R-S.C.), denied Podliska’s claims saying Podliska was cautioned for his efforts to discredit Clinton.
