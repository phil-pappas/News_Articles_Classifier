Vijender will be making his pro debut come Saturday against Britain's Sonny Whiting.\n\n\"In my analysis, Vijender is technically a very very talented boxer. You rarely see a natural talent like him. That's something which is very impressive about him,\" Beard told PTI in an interview from Manchester. \"He is a very experienced guy at the amateur level. He knows his punches and he punches very hard. All in all, I rate him as a brilliant boxer and I have very high hopes from him,\" he said.\n\nBut Vijender is not without faults either and his jabs is something that Beard worked on during their training stint, which has been on for more than a month. \"Every player has his own strengths and weaknesses and it's not that I am trying to teach him anything. But I have tried to make sure that his jabbing is better. That was one area which needed to be worked on.\n\n\"Besides, I have also tried to make sure that his body attacks are more precise and effective. These are some of the areas that we have together worked on in the last one month or so,\" Beard said.\n\n\"He is a hard-working guy. Although he is making his pro debut at 29, I would say he is in a very good space. He has been getting used to the new routine, new technique, new environment quite smoothly,\" he added.
