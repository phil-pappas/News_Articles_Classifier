The Redskins are coming off a loss to the New York Jets in week six which saw the Redskins lead 13-10 at half, only to fall apart in the second half en route to a 34-20 loss. The Bucs are fresh off their bye week. \nHere's who to start and who to sit based on the match up against Tampa Bay. \nStart 'Em: WR's Pierre Garcon and Jamison Crowder \nWith DeSean Jackson expected to miss another game and TE Jordan Reed returning from a concussion and other nagging injuries, Garcon and Crowder figure to be the go-to guys for QB Kirk Cousins on Sunday afternoon. And although Tampa Bay defends the pass well (202.4 YPG, 4th in NFL) they give up the fifth-most points to opposing fantasy wide receivers (26.6 PPG). \nOct 4, 2015; Landover, MD, USA; Washington Redskins wide receiver Pierre Garcon (88) stiff-arms Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Nolan Carroll (23) while running with the ball in the third quarter at FedEx Field. The Redskins won 23-20.

So if you're in a squeeze due to bye weeks or injuries, consider plugging Garcon or Crowder (especially in PPR leagues) to your fantasy lineup. \nSep 20, 2015; Landover, MD, USA; Washington Redskins wide receiver Jamison Crowder (80) returns a punt against the St. Louis Rams during the first half at FedEx Field. Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Brad Mills, Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports) \nDon't expect either of them to go off for 12 catches, 140 yards and a touchdown due to Cousins' inconsistency, but the two could combine for those numbers versus Tampa Bay on Sunday. \nSit 'Em: RB Alfred Morris \nIt's time to hang it up on Morris unfortunately. The former bell cow of Washington's backfield has been turned into a mere afterthought this season. Morris hasn't been able to find the endzone once in 2015 and even when he was the feature back against the Jets in week six due to a Matt Jones injury, Morris squeaked out 21 yards on 11 carries. \nSep 24, 2015; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; Washington Redskins running back Alfred Morris (46) is stopped by New York Giants strong safety Brandon Meriweather (22) and New York Giants defensive end Cullen Jenkins (99) during first half at MetLife Stadium.

Murray-USA TODAY Sports) \nWith Jones expected to suit up on Sunday for the Burgundy and Gold, it becomes exceedingly difficult to predict Morris' value (if he has any left at all). Some people will hold onto the fact that Morris has rushed for 1,000-plus yards in each of his past three seasons, but it just isn't there for Morris this year. Whether it's Jay Gruden's play calling, the emergence of Matt Jones or some other reason, Morris is simply not the fantasy-lock he used to be. \nIf you exclude Morris' 25-carry, 121-yard performance in week one against the Miami Dolphins, Morris has carried the ball 60 times for only 176 yards, which comes out to 2.93 yards per carry. Translation: Sit Morris if you haven't dropped him already. \nLike this story?
