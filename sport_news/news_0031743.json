(WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Ryan Lemond discusses what's ahead for UK fans including Kentucky-Auburn and Big Blue Madness. \nThis is a huge sports weekend. Of course, Keeneland is in session, the monster football game between UK and Auburn is Thursday night. Saturday night Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, WIllie Cauley-Stein, the Kings and the Pelicans play each other. But there's something else going on Friday night, Big Blue Madness. \nThat's right. We've all kind of forgot about it, kind of slipped up on all of us, but that's not a knock on the basketball program at all. These guys have enough talent to make another run at a national championship. It's more of a compliment to Mark Stoops and the football program. They're winning, they're playing better, and they've kept the fan base interested in football. \nAnd I'm telling you, if they're able to knock off Auburn Thursday night in that nationally televised game, this town will go crazy. Similar to what we see when UK wins a big basketball game in March. I'm all about football, although if they win, apparently I'm going to have to get a tattoo on my fanny of the final score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:53:52.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
