Fox and CBS average around 20 million viewers for their Sunday afternoon games while NBC's Sunday night contest draws more than 24 million people, according to Nielsen. \nOverall, 15.2 million people watched some or all of the game, according to Yahoo. In terms of Web streaming events, that is a big number. \nBut the lower figures represent the average audience a minute and provide an apples-to-apples comparison to TV ratings. \nThe smallest audience so far for an NFL game in the U.S. was 1.9 million on the cable outlet NFL Network several years ago. (The Yahoo figures don't include viewership of the CBS telecast, which aired only in the Jacksonville and Buffalo areas.) \nAccording to Yahoo, the Internet company delivered just over 33.6 million streams of the game across all devices including television, tablets and phones on multiple sites including Tumblr. About one-third of the streams came from international viewers. The game was available in 185 countries. \nYahoo, which was streaming coverage of the game provided by CBS Corp., didn't suffer any major issues such as an outage. There were some technical glitches such as freezes and blurry screens. \n\"We're pretty happy about it,\" Brian Rolapp, the NFL's executive vice president of media, said of Yahoo's coverage. It's never perfect, but from what we saw, the experience was positive.\" \nFor the NFL, the Yahoo game gave the league a chance to see if the Internet could handle live coverage of a game and get a sense of whether there is enough of an appetite to support using the platform more regularly. \nThe Internet as a distribution platform has to be a consideration for us going forward, said Mr. Rolapp, the NFL's executive vice president of media. Citing the quality of Yahoo's stream, Mr. Rolapp said Sunday night that, we feel a lot more comfortable with it today than we did yesterday. \nYahoo has already expressed interest in working with the NFL again and the league has indicated that a permanent online-only package of games is something likely to occur sooner rather than later. \nWe're seeing a dramatic shift in the industry as audiences' primary video watching moves away from TV, said Adam Cahan, Yahoo's senior vice president of product and engineering, in a statement. \nMost of the NFL's TV deals are locked up for several years but the league may have some wiggle room to try to carve out a small package. Also, CBS's Thursday package will be up for renewal next year. \nYahoo, which paid about $20 million for the rights to the game, sold commercials at far lower prices than those for a traditional game. Fox and CBS, each of which carry Sunday afternoon football, average about $500,000 per-30 second spot. Yahoo was seeking $150,000 for its stream but some spots went for half that, according to one media buyer who spends heavily on the NFL. \nHowever, the cost-per-thousand views Yahoo received was mostly on par with that of traditional television, meaning that the difference in rates was due to the anticipated smaller audience. \nYahoo has declined too say if the game will be profitable. \nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com \nCorrections & Amplifications \nThis item was corrected at 12:21 p.m. ET because it misstated viewer figures, based on information supplied by the NFL. The average audience was 2.36 million people globally and 1.64 million in the U.S. The total number of people who sampled some part of the game was 15.2 million.
