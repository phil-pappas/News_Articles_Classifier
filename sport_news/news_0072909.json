Christian and Central Christian lived up to expectations for only one of the two longtime 8-man football rivals. \nCentral Christian did the majority of the bruising on Thursday in a 42-6 blowout win that also came on Senior Night for the Crusaders at East Coweta Middle School’s McKnight Field. \nThe win kept Central unbeaten and atop the GICAA Division II West Region at 3-0 with just one remaining region game remaining against CrossPointe Christian on Oct. 30 to close the regular season. \nMaybe even bigger than the rivalry with Ballard, a matchup with CrossPointe comes against former Central offensive coordinator Jeff Weaver, now the Cavaliers’ head coach. \nWith last week’s win, Central maintained a game-and-a-half lead on CrossPointe (5-2, 1-1) in the division standings. \nThe Crusaders (8-0) can stay unbeaten with a win this week over Hancock Academy (0-3) on the road in Sparta to close ot the team’s non-region schedule. \nA rout of Ballard at home also amounted to merely a tune-up for Central, which scored on its first possession off a touchdown run from Deion Blackmon. The Crusaders defense then forced the Eagles three-and-out before senior Colt Dooley blocked Ballard’s punt and recovered the ball on his oppo- nents’ 5-yard-line. \nWith Central’s front line of seniors Jesse Parkerson, Jordan Fuller and Jared Ruck having its way with Ballard’s defensive line, teammate Bailey Todd carried it the rest of the way for another score. \nBlackmon, meanwhile, wasn’t done either. The senior running back hauled in a 68-yard touchdown pass from senior quarterback Jared Ruck. Blackmon later intercepted a pass and returned it \n80 yards for a touchdown. Marcellus Giles, Avery Staples and Dustin Terrell also made key plays on defense while senior Jared Farlow picked up his 12th interception of the season. \nFarlow, who was honored with Blackmon, Todd, Parkerson, Fuller, Ruck, Dooley and Caleb London, earned Max-Preps Player of the Week for the Southeast region.
