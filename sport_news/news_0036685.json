The sides had been at a stalemate, but reached a verbal agreement Wednesday, less than a week before the season opener. \nThe team hopes to make the signing official Thursday. \nAfter Thompson declined to sign a one-year, $6.9 million qualifying offer from the team, it appeared he might be willing to sit out part of the regular season. LeBron James had called Thompson's holdout a \"distraction\" during training camp.
