The Saints started the game with a quick 3-and-out before the Dallas Cowboys started running the ball at will. After a 45-yard run by Lance Dunbar, the Saints defense tightened up and the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal to put their first points on the board.The Saints quickly responded with a drive that reminded fans of the up-tempo offense that made their team perennial favorites in the NFC. Brees topped off an 11 play, 80-yard drive with a short touchdown pass to Tight End Josh Hill giving the Saints their first lead of the game.Cowboys' running back Joseph Randle would push in another Touchdown on a near fumble that would put Dallas up 10-7 going into halftime. \nThe Saints then tied the cowboys in the third quarter off of a 51-yard field goal by Zach Hocker. The Saints and Cowboys would exchange another set of field goals, to tie the game at 13 in the third quarter.Another set of touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including a Khiry Robinson touchdown run and a Terrance Williams touchdown catch within the two-minute mark would lead to the Saints running a two-minute drill for the win.Unfortunately, Zach Hocker bounced a 30-yard attempt of the uprights and the game went into overtime.Fortunately, C.J. Spiller lived up to his reputation and turned a wheel route from the 20-yard line into an 80-yard touchdown catch giving the Saints the win and Drew Brees his 400th career touchdown.Drew Brees joined Peyton Manning (535), Brett Favre (508), Dan Marina (420) and Tom Brady (402) as the fifth QB to ever reach 400 touchdowns.The Saints face the Philadelphia Eagles on the road next weekend on Oct. 11 at Noon on Fox 8. \nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
