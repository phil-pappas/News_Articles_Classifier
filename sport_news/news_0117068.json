But in current scenario where no big teams are willing to tour Pakistan I think that is also a factor in the Indians turning us down,\" Inzamam said in an interview. The stylish batsman who appeared in 120 tests and 378 ODIs said that if Pakistan and India resumed bilateral ties it would be beneficial for both countries. \"I have said it before that when we play against each other the players get the chance to play under pressure and improve their confidence. It is not about just Pakistan benefitting by playing India it is also about India benefitting by playing against us,\" he said. \"But I think the fact that we have other problems in the country like teams not willing to tour is a big factor in the current Indo-Pak relations status.\" Inzamam said that when he played every team wanted to play against Pakistan in Pakistan and do well. \"We were sought after team because we have some world class performers. But now with no teams willing to tour because of security reasons the situation has change for us.\" The former captain said that instead of running after the Indian board, PCB should first focus on making the PSL its signature event and try to create conditions and convince teams to resume touring Pakistan. \"Right now to be honest we have to bear with even injustice and unreasonable demands. I think the board would be better off having more events like the PSL and organising matches even against smaller teams at home.\" Inzamam said that the best thing for Pakistan cricket was that due to its raw talent it had even survived the difficult times which some other teams might not have been able to do so. \"We are doing well in the world of cricket and that is good for us. It means sooner or later when the situation changes everyone will want to play us. Every wants to play against a top side.\" He said the current lot of players had done well to perform in spite of the difficult conditions and even after the spot fixing scandal of 2010. \"We have shown we remain a top team and I am sure sooner or later India will want to play against us.\" â€” PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:38:58.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
