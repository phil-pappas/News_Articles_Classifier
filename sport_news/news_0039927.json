The Miners were up 25-21 with 11:52 left in the fourth quarter after trailing 21-12 at the half. Yreka retook the lead in the fourth when running back Drew Kannely-Robles threw the ball for a 10-yard touchdown to David Ruiz. Lassen came back and scored twice to earn the win. Kannely-Robles had two rushing touchdowns, including a 63-yard score, and ran for more than 100 yards for the fifth consecutive game. Yreka fell to 4-2 overall, while Lassen improved to 2-4. “Our players battled,” Miner head coach Orlyn Culp said. “During the game, we didn’t capitalize when we had opportunities early, then we battled back to take the lead. In the third and fourth quarters, we had injuries to the starting defensive line and our starting offensive line when we needed them most. In the fourth quarter, we just could not get their offense off the grass. We needed a stop and couldn’t get it. Overall, I’m pleased with how our players competed for the entire game.” Yreka received the ball first to start the contest and moved the ball to the Lassen 39, but could not capitalize and had to punt. Things went the Miners way, when, on the first offensive possession for Lassen, the Grizzlies coughed the ball up and Kannely-Robles recovered the pigskin for Yreka with 9:55 remaining in the first quarter at around the 35 of Lassen. Kannely-Robles proceeded to shed Lassen defenders for a more than 30 yard run to the one-yard line of the Grizzlies. With 8:55 left in the quarter, Kannely Robles scored from two yards out to make it 6-0 in favor of Yreka, which missed the point after attempt. Lassen came back and tied the game on a 12-yard run by David Lee with 9:23 left in the second quarter, and Lassen also missed the extra point try. Yreka regained the lead when Kannely-Robles ducked, dodged and dived over and around Lassen defenders for a 63-yard score with 8:56 left in the half to take a 12-6 lead. Lassen was able to stop the 2-point conversion attempt by the Miners Yreka maintained the positive momentum by recovering another fumble by Lassen on its own 32. Yreka was able to move down to around the 10-yard line, but missed the field goal try. Page 2 of 2 - Lassen marched efficiently down the field with its running attack and scored on a 8-yard run by Lee and a successful 2-point conversion run to lead 14-12 with 2:51 left in the half. It appeared the Miners would trail by two at the half with Lassen in a fourth down situation at the Miner 26 with only 0.2 seconds left on the clock. The Grizzlies connected on a 26-yard TD throw in front of a stunned Yreka crowd to run off the field with a 21-12 halftime advantage. In the third quarter, the Miners found themselves in a fourth and three situation from the Lassen 30. The home fans got to their feet when Miner quarterback Juan Cota found Tyler O’Gorman for a 30-yard touchdown strike, and they made point after kick to cut the Lassen lead to 21-19 with 3:10 left in the quarter. On the next Lassen possession, Brandon Hanna of Yreka picked off the ball and and ran down to the Grizzlies’ 20 to give the Miners the perfect opportunity to retake the lead. But Yreka struggled to move the ball and had a 4th down and 13 situation at the Lassen 23 near the end of the quarter. Cota found Ruiz, who stretched out to get the first down as the ball was spotted on the 10-yard line. Yreka scored on the Kannely-Robles pass to Ruiz to take the 25-21 lead, and the 2-point attempt was stopped by Lassen. Lassen went down the field on a fairly time consuming 85-yard drive, as Lee scored again from around 5-yards out to take a 27-25 lead with 6:10 remaining, and the Miners were able to stop the Lassen 2-point attempt. With Yreka having possession of the ball and time ticking away, the Miners could muster very little on offense and had to punt the ball away with around four minutes remaining. Lassen took over around the Yreka 40, and kept pounding the ball on the ground and picking up positive yardage. Lee scored his fourth rushing TD of the night with a 10-yard run. With the point after attempt successful, Lassen took the 34-25 lead with 1:37 left and Yreka lost the contest by nine points. Yreka faces Anderson at home this Friday .
