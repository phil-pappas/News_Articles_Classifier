But that became less likely after deGrom threw 121 pitches in his Game 1 gem on Friday. \nSo Matz, the 24-year-old Long Island native, will make his first start since Sept. 24. He was scratched from his final regular-season outing because of back spasms. Matz threw five innings in a simulated game on Thursday at the team’s complex in Port St. Lucie, Fla., and came through it healthy. He was not with the team in Los Angeles, and flew to New York on Saturday night. \nAfter throwing off the Citi Field mound on Sunday, Matz said he’s \"a hundred percent.\" \n\"I feel like I’m ready,\" Matz said. \"I can go deep into games if I can take myself there. I’m feeling good.\" \nMatz went 4-0 with a 2.27 ERA in six regular-season starts after he was called up in June. \nThe left-hander said getting the chance to soak in the playoff atmosphere tonight before taking the mound for Game 4 should be beneficial. \n\"I think it’ll definitely help for sure to watch Matt [Harvey] perform [tonight] and kind of take it all in,\" Matz said. \nHARVEY IN RELIEF? Even though he’s trying to be cautious about how many innings he throws, Harvey said he’d be open to pitching in relief in Game 5, if there is one. \n\"Obviously, after [tonight] I’m going to do everything I can to get my body and arm back as soon as possible,\" Harvey said. \"Obviously I can’t throw a uniform on and run to the bullpen and say, ‘I want to throw in the seventh inning.’ But I’ll definitely speak my mind and let them know how I feel going into that game.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:26:15.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
