Mike Tyson was a machine at 21 and I can keep on going,” he said. \n“Look at the best generals, Alexander the Great was 21.” \nAs for his fly-half, Meyer added: “I believe Handre Pollard can be Springboks captain one day. He has taken a lot of control of the 10 channel. \n“Even though they are not the most experienced, I truly believe in these guys. \n“It’s about backing them now. They have to know they are good enough to play and it’s my job to get them in the right mode.” \nBut Meyer added he was glad that 33-year-old scrum-half Fourie du Preez is captain in the absence of de Villiers and Matfield. \nMeyer, who first worked with a teenage du Preez at the Blue Bulls, persuaded the scrum-half to resume a Test career which appeared to have been cut short by injury and a move to Japanese club Suntory Sungoliath. \n“I begged him to come back because I know he is the type of guy if you have him in your team and he clicks, he is like Richie McCaw for the All Blacks,” said Meyer of the 74-times capped du Preez. \nMeyer came under immense pressure after the Japan loss and defeat on Saturday could signal the end of his three-year reign as Springbok coach. \n“I said after the first game as a coach your players feed off you,” he said. \n“There have been leaders in times of peace, but it’s when there is a war that you want to see the leaders’ character. \n“But I have said to the players this week we are right back to where we started and we have to go through.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:13:16.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
