(Dean Hood) is a very good coach that knows what he's doing and a good program with some talented players. They don't have as much depth because of numbers, but some very good players.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK-EKU | 3 keys and a prediction\nChief among the Eastern Kentucky players under the spotlight Saturday will be center Colton Scurry and defensive lineman Patrick Graffree, who played principle roles in two January fights involving UK players Drew Barker, Dorian Baker and Tymere Dubose.\nNo charges were filed from either incident – the first of which took place in a Richmond bar and the second in the lobby of an EKU dorm – but Scurry and Graffree were both suspended and ultimately reinstated to the EKU roster before the season. Any punishment for the UK players involved was handled internally and not made public.\nAll five players involved in the January fights are eligible to play Saturday, and Stoops guaranteed Barker, as the backup quarterback, would make his collegiate debut against the Colonels.\n“It’s done with,” Stoops said of any lingering tension between the two programs. “We’ve got to move on. I’ve got great respect for Coach Hood and their program, the program he’s building, the tradition they’ve had and what they’ve done. ... I think this can be a very good situation, a good rivalry.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nFive Questions | Breaking down EKU\n\"I’ve seen it before, at other programs where teams that are so close let that kind of stuff filter into the game, and there’s no place for it.”\nBarker, a former four-star recruit who lost the starting quarterback competition to Patrick Towles in preseason camp, has yet to do anything on the field to rival the headlines resulting from a video released by Richmond police of Graffree walking into the lobby of an EKU dorm and punching Barker in the back of the head.\nThe two players could conceivably meet in the Kentucky backfield Saturday, but Barker is doing his best to focus on his collegiate debut and not the fallout from his previous encounter with Graffree.\n“Just looking forward to the opportunity and going out there and moving the offense how I know best, and I’m definitely really excited,” Barker said. “I think everybody, when they get their first college game, first college start, whatever, it’s kind of a surreal moment.”\nGraffree is one of two former Kentucky scholarship players on the EKU roster. He and running back Dy’Shawn Mobley both transferred to EKU during Stoops’ first year at Kentucky.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nMobley returning to UK as EKU star\nMobley showed a glimpse of his talent with 235 yards in his final two games as a Wildcat in 2013, but he has blossomed into a star at EKU, earning OVC offensive player of the year honors. Mobley has been slowed by a hamstring injury this season, but he told The Courier-Journal this week he plans to play against Kentucky.\nGraffreee and Mobley are joined by 10 other FBS transfers on the EKU roster. EKU defensive lineman Noah Spence, a former five-star recruit who started 13 games at Ohio State as a sophomore in 2013, may be the best player on the field Saturday.\nEKU players and coaches will enter the matchup with heavy hearts after the death of redshirt freshman defensive lineman Joey Kraemer in an automobile accident Sunday.\nUK plans to honor Kraemer, who was a high school teammate of Wildcats’ tight end Greg Hart, during the playing of “My Old Kentucky Home” before the game. EKU players will wear black patches on their jerseys to honor Kraemer during the game.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK Practice Report | Boom's status unchanged\n“We’ve got a lot of people hurting, but we’re locked in arms and working through all those things a situation like this brings up,” EKU coach Dean Hood said.\nThe added storylines for the game appear to decrease the likelihood of any sort of letdown for a Kentucky team coming off three consecutive SEC games and facing a bye week before the first Thursday night game in Commonwealth Stadium history.\nIf anything, Stoops will have to keep an eye out for too much emotion early in Saturday’s game.\nHe reached out to Hood this week to deliver his condolences for the loss of Kraemer and to assure there will be no repeats of the January fisticuffs from his players.\n“I have great respect for him and their program and what they've done,” Stoops said. “We’re looking forward to welcoming them to our stadium and playing a good, clean, hard-fought game.\"\nEmail Jon Hale at jahale@courier-journal.com .
