Giants tight end Daniel Fells, who has spent the last several weeks battling an MRSA infection, had his seventh surgery on Saturday, according to a report, but is progressing toward a release from the hospital.\nAccording to ESPN, Fells' infection is under control. He has two more surgeries scheduled, though, which will clean out the infection to prevent it from returning. The coming procedures will also include plastic surgery to restore any damage done to his infected foot over the last few weeks. Fells reportedly hopes to leave the hospital some time in the next two weeks, then return for his other surgeries.\nFells, 32, was a critical piece of the Giants offense before the MRSA infection was discovered while he was receiving routine treatment for an ankle injury. He was placed on injured reserve on Oct. 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:57:22.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
