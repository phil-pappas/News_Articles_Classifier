The Marcos have been doing it in dominant fashion. And they’re not planning to take it easy on teams any time soon. “A couple of years ago we were getting beaten by teams by the scores we've been beating teams by,” Polo senior quarterback Brody Grobe said. “Other teams had their turn and now it's our turn. We're going not going to mess around. We're going to play hard every snap of the ball no matter what the outcome is going to be.” Polo has outscored opponents 372-21 and pitched four shutouts during its perfect 7-0 run, which has been fueled by an experienced and talented group of players who have the Marcos headed for a conference title and a high playoff seed. The Marcos haven’t scored less than 45 points and haven’t given up more than eight in any game. “I think it speaks to all three facets of our game,” Polo coach Andrew Hofer said. “Our offense gets it rolling early and often in most games. Our defense and our special teams have really put our offense in some good situations and our offense seems to capitalize on almost all of those. It's really a combination of the three.” The defense has shown the most improvement for the Marcos, who have given up 176 fewer points through their first seven games than last year. “We've just really adapted well with our personnel on the defensive side,” Hofer said. “We weren't having enough success with what we were doing last year, so we made some changes to adapt to our speed and our aggressiveness and given some different looks and different fronts and coverages and I think the kids have really taken to it.” Polo is two wins away from tying the school record ( 9-1 in 1991 and 9-3 in 1983 ) and puts its unbeaten record on the line Friday at Ashton-Franklin Center. The Raiders are 4-3 and fighting to become playoff eligible in the final two weeks of the regular season, and their option style offense will be a unique challenge for the Marco defense. “It presents some difficulties that we don't get to see a lot in our conference,” Hofer said. “We're going to have to play assignment-sound football if we want to be able to match them and the intensity that they're going to bring.” No team has come close to matching the Marcos, who, barring an upset, will head into the postseason undefeated and possibly unchallenged. But Hofer isn’t concerned about his team losing focus or motivation.

Each Friday night is a new step and you can't get to one step without meeting the other. And the Marcos certainly believe enough in themselves to reach their goals. “We going into every game confident,” Grobe said. “Not cocky, but confident. We trust our coaches. We trust each other. We trust the whole program and it's nice having that.” By Adam Kradle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:29:59.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
