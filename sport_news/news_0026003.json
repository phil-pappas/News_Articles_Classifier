Guys on this team feel the need to show up and compete every day. ... I don't expect people to give that a whole lot of credence. But, for me, when I look in the mirror after every game, that's what me and the staff hang our hat on.\" \nRunnels has been with Weiss since the manager took over two years ago. Doyle was hired before the 2014 season, to take the place of Dante Bichette. \nPitching coach Steve Foster and bullpen coach Darren Holmes, who were hired at the start of 2015, will also return.
