Nile C. Kinnick was eliminated on Friday 38-10 by American School In Japan. \nOnly ASIJ and Kadena remain in the running for the D-I title-game visitors’ berth; the Mustangs visit the Panthers on Friday in Kadena’s homecoming game. \nMeanwhile, the Dragons concluded their regular season at 6-1, the only loss being a 27-14 defeat on Oct. 16 against Kadena after Kubasaki had already clinched the season series from the Panthers with two earlier victories. \n“We had a great team victory today,” Bales said, adding that Falcons coach Jimbo Davis “had his team ready to play. They put up a good fight. We just happened to make some plays.” \nMany of them were made by Johnson, the Pacific’s total-offense leader. The senior quarterback ran nine times for 64 yards and a TD went 20-for-24 for 206 yards and three touchdowns, making him 36-for-43 for 410 yards and five touchdowns the last two games. \n“He had another great game throwing the football,” Bales said. Johnson is 90-for-143 for 1,394 yards and 16 TDs, with 63 rushing attempts for 676 yards and six scores on the season. \nJavohn Journigan added 111 yards and a rushing TD on 13 carries. Jacob Green, Miles Mahlock and Lester Parker each caught a scoring pass from Johnson; Mahlock had six catches for 87 yards, giving him a Pacific-best 33 receptions for 704 yards and 8 TDs. \nDefensively, Preston Snyder led the Dragons with 16 tackles, three for losses. Triston Puckett added seven tackles and a fumble recovery. \nThe Falcons had opportunities to score, missing out on a first-and-goal at the Kubasaki 1 in the third quarter, and also dropped a couple of potential interception-return touchdowns. \n“The chances were there; we just didn’t capitalize,” Davis said. \nThe Falcons conclude their regular season with a Friday home date against Humphreys, which lost its primary weapon, senior Jaylin Barmer, with a fractured wrist in Friday’s 34-15 loss to Singapore. “I was looking forward to playing him,” Davis said.
