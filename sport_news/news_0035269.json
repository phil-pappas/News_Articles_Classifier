He was successful at Oregon but has yet to match that in the NFL. \n“I get it — we’re not successful and we’re not winning,” Kelly said Thursday. “I came from college, (so) I’m going to go back to college.” \nHe hopes to become like the Giants’ Tom Coughlin, a former Boston College coach, “where I win enough games that the speculation ends.” \nKelly is friends with Steve Sarkisian, who was fired this week at USC one day after being placed on leave. \n“(He) is dealing with an issue right now and I wish him the best,” Kelly said. — (AP)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:52:44.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
