That always gives us a lot of momentum and always gives us juice.” \nBradford threw for 280 yards with a 32-yard touchdown pass to Riley Cooper, but had three interceptions to keep New York in the game. The Giants got zero points off the turnovers. \n“We were stagnant,” Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. “They did more with their opportunities than we did.” \nThe Eagles (3-3) have won two straight to move from last place in the NFC East into a tie for first with the Giants (3-3). \nThe teams meet again in Week 17. \nNeither team looked sharp in front of a prime-time audience. They combined for seven turnovers and 21 penalties. \n“That’s bad football,” Coughlin said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:10:31.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
