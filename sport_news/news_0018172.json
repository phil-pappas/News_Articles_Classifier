In Da Club by 50 Cent was the No. 1 song of the year. Arnold Schwarzenegger was sworn in as governator of California. \nIt was also the last time that Boyle County and Danville won football titles in the same year, ending a stretch where the neighboring schools combined for eight titles in five seasons. Hence the name \"Titletown.\" \nThrough seven games in 2003, the central Kentucky powerhouses were a combined 13-1 — the one loss Boyle County's 45-26 win over the Admirals. \nThrough seven games this season, the central Kentucky powerhouses are a combined 13-1 — the one loss Boyle County's 42-20 win over the Admirals. \nAs the late Yogi Berra might say, it's deja vu all over again. \nLegendary coach Chuck Smith has Boyle County purring again in the second year of his second stint at the school. Danville is off to its best start yet in Clay Clevenger 's third year. \nBoyle County puts its undefeated season on the line when Lexington Catholic visits this week. Smith said the Knights present a lot of problems. \nIn his last three games versus LexCath, Smith is 0-3. That dates to a 43-42 loss in his first stint with the school and two losses last season by a combined 14 points. All of those games were in Lexington. \n\"When you go up against a team as balanced as Lexington Catholic it puts a lot of pressure on your defense,\" said Smith. They're especially talented in their receiving corps, he said. \nJosiah Robbins has stood out at quarterback for the Rebels. Smith said he's throwing the ball better than last season and stepped up as a leader. \n\"He's really understanding what we want and how we've got to get it done,\" Smith said. \nDanville is the presumed favorite against 1-6 Middlesboro this week. It should come to Lexington Christian next Friday with a blemish-free record aside from the Boyle County letdown. \nShould LCA get past Somerset this week, next week's battle will outright decide the top seed in Class 2A, District 7. \nThe Ads edged the Eagles 58-57 last year. \nIn Clevenger's mind, though, the next game on the schedule is always the biggest one. \n\"We've had some lapses throughout the year where we don't look like a very good football team,\" Clevenger said. \"We have to understand that if we don't bring it every day and every game, we can be very average pretty easily.\" \nHe lauded a senior class that's worked hard under his watch and is finally seeing some fruits from its labor. That group includes leading rusher Stephen Ray , who has a team-high 11 touchdowns this season. \nSophomore D'maruriae VanCleave leads the Ads in receiving and is their second-leading rusher. Quarterback Zack Dampier is a junior who has thrown for more than 1,300 yards and 16 TDs. \n\"We don't really have a superstar so to speak,\" Clevenger said. \"Any given game we've had a guy lead us in receiving, lead us in rushing. The defense is playing really good football right now. ... \n\"There's still a lot of football to be played as far as whether or not we get back to maybe what it was in the early 2000s.\" \nWhether or not the two schools can pull off what they did in 2003 remains to be seen. But the enthusiasm is as rich as it's ever been. \n\"This community just loves football,\" Smith said. \"I think that's the thing that we're known for statewide. The football from this community is just big.\" \nBetween his first stint, at Boyle County from 1992 through 2004, and this one Smith said there's a difference in the kids. That's attributable to them having more options for things to do now. \nOne thing hasn't changed, though. \n\"A Boyle County kid will work all day long,\" Smith said, \"and he'll come back and ask for more. That's what I love about 'em.\" \nParis vs. Bishop Brossart \nIt's been awhile since the Paris Greyhounds were undefeated this deep into a season. \nTry 1982, when Paris won its second title in a row and posted its second straight undefeated season. The 2015 edition looks startlingly similar to that last title team. \nSenior running back James Clark 's dad, also named James , was a running back on that team. Aaron Maggard , quarterback for the current Paris squad, is the son of Robert Maggard , who quarterbacked those teams. \n\"We're getting players from parents that were a part of those runs back then,\" Paris Coach Brian Washington said. \"Those kids are coming through now, which is a tremendous feat in itself.\" \nWashington began his second go-round at Paris in 2012, when his son was a junior. He coached the Greyhounds briefly from 2005-07. \n\"We've been building it up to this point,\" said Washington, who's coached Paris to back-to-back 9-3 seasons. \"We're getting our experienced players to varsity level. They're older now. Instead of freshmen and sophomores they're a strong junior and senior class.\" \nThe Greyhounds (8-0) host fellow unbeaten Bishop Brossart (7-0) in a de facto battle for the No. 1 seed in Class A, District 5 on Friday. \nStudents upend mentor \nEast Jessamine's 26-14 win over Taylor County last Thursday wasn't just the Jaguars' first district win in almost a year. It was also Coach Mike Bowlin 's first time facing his former boss, Dudley Hilton . \nBowlin coached under Hilton at Bell County in 1995. The pupil said Hilton employs many of the same plays and formations, which he thought gave the Jags a small advantage. \n\"Coach Hilton, he's not a big flash and smoke guy,\" Bowlin said. \"He's not going to try to trick you a lot. He's just gonna try to run right at ya.\" \nIt was East Jessamine that did most of the running Thursday. More precisely, it was Justin McIntyre , who had 153 yards for the Jaguars (5-3). \nJordan Marcum , East Jessamine's defensive coordinator, played under Hilton at Bell County. Bowlin said Marcum was \"extremely motivated\" heading into Thursday. \n\"This was the biggest game on the schedule for us this year,\" Bowlin said. \"You don't want to be shown up by the guy who gave you a job or coached ya.\" \nEast Jessamine honored its 2003 football team during Thursday's game. The '03 Jags went 10-2, ending with a loss in the second round to eventual state runner-up Highlands. \nHilton, the state's second winningest coach all-time, has Taylor County off to a 3-4 start. \nAn All-American Rose \nMatt Rose , who ended his career at Lexington Christian as the school's second-leading scorer in boys' basketball, was recently named a second team All-American by the National Christian School Athletic Association. \nRose is a freshman at Samford this fall. He's not the only Bulldog with a Kentucky connection. \nThe head coach is former St. Xavier/University of Kentucky player Scott Padgett , entering his second season guiding the Bulldogs. Darius Jones-Gibson (Tates Creek) and Christen Cunningham (Henry Clay/Cordia) also play at Samford. \nThe Bulldogs open their season at Louisville on Nov. 13. \nUdoka Azubuike — a class of 2016 center out of Florida who sports a host of offers including ones from UK, Duke and Kansas — was also named to the second team. \nElsewhere \nJake Damron , a freshman at Ashland Blazer, will represent the Lexington Shriners Hospital in the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open next weekend in Las Vegas. \nDamron is one of 18 ambassadors who will carry the scores for professional groups during the PGA Tour event. \n\"I am beyond excited to watch some of the best golfers in the world compete in the game I love to play,\" Damron said in a news release. \nDamron suffers from Erb's Palsy, a paralysis of the arm. At age 12, he underwent surgery to elongate a tendon in his arm. \nHe's defied doctors' expectations and played several sports at Blazer, including golf. \n\"I really didn't think of myself as any different,\" Damron said in the release. My arm just isn't an issue to me.\" \n■ The U.S. Army will present Landon Young with his All-American Bowl jersey on Oct. 26. \nThe jersey presentation will be held in conjunction with the school's fall sports pep rally. It is not open to the public. \nHousekeeping \n■ Surveys were emailed to boys' and girls' basketball coaches this week. Please return those in a timely fashion so that we can provide comprehensive coverage of your teams and get an accurate snapshot of the forthcoming season. \n■ Due to mandatory training at the Herald-Leader, there will not be a high school notebook next week. \nI encourage you to bookmark my blog and/or Twitter page so you don't miss anything significant that happens over the next week.
