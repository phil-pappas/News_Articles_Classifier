Check. And check. \nPast promises Strong had made and didn't deliver on were dissected one-by-one all week. His most recent promise made Monday, that intense, passionate effort would be on display from his team at the Cotton Bowl was signed, sealed and delivered by the very Texas players who seemed to be ripping the program apart only days before. \nTexas might not be back. It won't crack the Top 25 on Sunday and it still might even be a recruiting class or two away from true Big 12 and national contention. But on this sun-drenched Saturday at the Cotton Bowl, the Longhorns, sniping upperclassmen and underclassmen alike, put away the excuses, set aside their differences and punched the Sooners in the mouth with a determined, collective effort. \nGive former Oklahoma assistant Jay Norvell, now the Longhorns' play-caller, major credit for finally putting into action a physical, bull-headed game plan that took a nasty, no-nonsense attitude to execute. Of Texas' 70 plays, 58 were rushes. They did it with key senior right tackle Kent Perkins out of the lineup and two true freshmen plowing the OU line. \nSenior running back Johnathan Gray was a workhorse, carrying 22 times for 76 yards. Sophomore D'Onta Freeman finished with 117 yards, 81 coming on a backbreaking romp in the heart-stopping fourth quarter as Texas desperately fought to hold onto the lead. \nRedshirt freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard only threw it 10 times and he killed OU with his legs, escaping trouble and churning up 115 yards on 21 carries. Even senior wide receiver Marcus Johnson showed signs of being the playmaker Texas so frustratingly has lacked, breaking tackles for the game's first touchdown and making four big catches in all. \nAnd credit Strong for a defensive game plan that shut down hot quarterback Baker Mayfield and OU's new Air Raid offense. Befuddled and embarrassed a week ago by TCU's aerial assault, this Texas defense played with attitude, even a measure of swagger. With 4:24 to go, a pair of Longhorn sophomore linemen, Naashon Hughes and Poona Ford , sacked Mayfield on third-and-14 to effectively end the Sooners' chances. \n\"I'm just so proud of our players, they came out and competed,\" Strong told ESPN immediately after the game. \"All week they hurt so much that they didn't have their pride, and just the way they battled back. I know this, I've been saying it and I truly believe it, we have a good football team.\" \n\"I'm just so proud of our players, they came out and competed.\" \nCharlie Strong \nThe players' belief in their coach was evident in their effort alone, and then stamped home with the jubilant celebration after what most predicted would be another blowout loss to continue Texas' worst start in more than a half-century. \nIn the glow of victory, Texas players gathered on the field in a flowing circle of burnt orange, jumping for joy, and then there was Strong, flat on his back, the hands of his players supporting him and bouncing him up and down. The less-than-capacity Texas ground stood on their feet, cheering and hollering and for the first time in a long while proudly holding their horns way up for all to see. \nA bit later Strong had donned the golden cowboy hat annually awarded to the winning team of this century-old rivalry. He pointed to the fans and his players and coaches, and beamed a smile bigger than the inflatable \"Big Tex\" who keeps watch over the Cotton Bowl from the neighboring Texas State Fair. \nIt's just one win, one win that allows Texas to take a 2-4 overall record and 1-2 mark in the Big 12 into a much-needed bye week. But it can all vanish just as quickly if the Longhorns don't come out to play in two weeks against an always game Kansas State team. \nBut just as things looked the bleakest for Strong during his short time at Texas, he proved he indeed has control of the program. And for now that's the best sign Texas could have. MORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL: Want stories delivered to you?
