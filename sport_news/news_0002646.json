That Aug. 13 evening, optimism was in short supply.\nRumors of bad news had swirled weeks in advance. Czart spoke to his team the night before the meeting, using the looming decision to engender team bonding and an us-against-the-world mentality.\nCzart and hundreds of others in the Phoenix family simultaneously heard the news through the online stream: after eight years, Lincoln-Way North would close after this school year.\n\"When they finally did announce it, I felt sick to my stomach,\" Czart said. \"As much as I thought I'd be ready for it, when they announced it, it hit me hard.\"\nCzart is the only head coach in the program's history. After 19 years as an assistant at Providence and Lockport, he was hired the year before North was slated to open. He coached Lincoln-Way East's sophomore team, which would become North's varsity the next year, for the 2007 season.\nThe inaugural 2008 team — which featured no seniors, three sophomores and the rest juniors — competed against Southwest Suburban Conference powerhouses like Bolingbrook, Lockport, Homewood-Flossmoor and Lincoln-Way East, often being outmanned \"by over 100 pounds on the lines,\" according to Czart.\nLincoln-Way North football gallery Allen Cunningham / Daily Southtown The Lincoln-Way North Phoenix open up the 2015 season against Richards on August 28, 2015.\nThe Lincoln-Way North Phoenix open up the 2015 season against Richards on August 28, 2015.\n(Allen Cunningham / Daily Southtown) That team went 0-9 and was outscored 266-84, but the coach knew things would change quickly. The next season, North went 6-0 in the Southwest Suburban Red and made the Class 6A playoffs.\nSince the winless 2008 season, the Phoenix have gone 47-19. They've qualified for the playoffs five of the last six years, with this year's 4-0 start likely to make it six of seven.\nThat journey — from 0-9 to perennial playoff contender — may look good to an outsider. But not to Czart. His team has reached the quarterfinals only once (2013) and lost in the first round three times, including last year's gut-punch 17-10 defeat to Wheaton Warrenville South.\n\"The bar is set high at Lincoln-Way,\" Czart said. \"I wanted to do more. The kids have worked so hard. On one hand, you look back and you say, 'Yeah, we've done all right.' But on the other, I'm not satisfied at all. I think we should've gone further every year in the playoffs. Every year I thought, 'We've got to do better than this, we've got to do better than this.'\nPrep football: Barrington QB Johnny Davidson doesn't wrestle with success Bob Narang From an early age, Johnny Davidson envisioned reaching the pinnacle of his favorite winter sport.\nDavidson's aspirations were geared toward success on the wrestling mat, with hopes of one day raising his hands in triumph at the state meet in Champaign.\nAll signs pointed toward Davidson achieving...\nFrom an early age, Johnny Davidson envisioned reaching the pinnacle of his favorite winter sport.\nDavidson's aspirations were geared toward success on the wrestling mat, with hopes of one day raising his hands in triumph at the state meet in Champaign.\nAll signs pointed toward Davidson achieving...\n(Bob Narang) \"It's like my last chance, our last chance to do what I think we should've done already. That's just my expectation for myself, my respect for the kids and the community.\"\nInitially, middle linebacker and captain Dave Lux wasn't too broken up about the closing. He's a senior and will be moving on next year regardless. But as time passed and the more it sunk in, the more his coach's words — \"We need to make a statement this year\" — rang out.\n\"It's not a positive thing, but we've managed to turn it into a positive thing,\" Lux said. \"It's driving us, driving us to show what North is really about.\"\nAgainst Richards in Week 1, the Phoenix rallied from a 21-point halftime deficit to win 30-29. They delivered Sandburg its only loss to date in Week 2. Their five remaining games include three against teams that have yet to lose — Bradley-Bourbonnais this week, Thornton in Week 7 and Lincoln-Way West to close the regular season.\nLux said winning the state title in the school's final year — \"just thinking about it gives me the chills\" — is the team's foremost motivation. His brother, Dan, was a member of North's first graduating class, the starting middle linebacker on that inaugural 0-9 team. To finish what his brother started with an undefeated season would be \"special.\"\nLincoln-Way North's non-seniors will attend Lincoln-Way East next school year. Czart's future is unclear. He hopes a spot in the Lincoln-Way football system will open for him next summer.\nFor now, the coach's sole focus is on this chance, this season and this team. Lincoln-Way North, as far as Czart is concerned, deserves that respect.\n\"When I'm walking the halls alone after practice, the place is empty and the lights are on, the building looks the same but nobody else is around,\" Czart said. \"It's lonely out there, and that's when it really hits you. 'Oh my gosh, this place is really closing.'\n\"But when we're together with the kids,\" he added slowly, \"it helps you forget all that other stuff.\"\n Sports High School Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560369bb/turbine/ct-spt-0925-prep-fb-lincoln-way-north-20150924", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56036934/turbine/ct-spt-0925-prep-fb-feature-barrington-20150924", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560324a6/turbine/chi-ctlfl-ct-sta-football-richards-lincoln-way-north-st-0830-297-20150828"], "published": "2015-09-24T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:55:42.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
