We’ve seen good things in spurts.” \nPen Argyl (0-5 overall and in the league) forced Salisbury into a three-and-out on the first possession of the game. Then drove 80 yards to take a 7-0 lead on Logan Sterner’s 3-yard touchdown run and Tyler Minnich’s PAT. \nSterner’s TD broke a streak of nine straight scoreless quarters for the Knights, dating back to the third quarter of Week 2’s 28-20 loss to Palmerton. Then, two plays after the kickoff, Logan Reppert intercepted Weber and returned it 30 yards for a score. \nIn a span of 56 seconds, the Knights led 14-0 and were on the verge of expanding that lead early in the second quarter. \nAfter Jake Holden picked off Weber, Pen Argyl drove to the Falcons 14, highlighted by a 23-yard run by Austin Heisler. The Falcons defense stiffened and, on fourth-and 12 from the 16, Devin Irwin sacked Holden for a 12-yard loss. \nSalisbury (3-2) took possession at the 28. Six plays later, Alex Kubinec cut the deficit to 14-6 with a 30-yard TD run. \nThe Green Knights would not threaten again. \n“We let them play,” Salisbury coach Andy Cerco said. “Let them be athletes. They’re a veteran group that’s been in our program for four years. They know what we expect. We didn’t panic. We just stayed with the game plan and let our guys do what they do.” \nShane Wittman capped the Falcons next possession with an 8-yard TD run with 59 seconds left the half. Mason Donaldson’s extra point made it 14-14 at intermission. \nPen Argyl got the ball first in the second half, but the possession was short lived as Falcons free safety intercepted Holden at the Green Knights 38 and Salisbury turned the game over to its loaded stable of talented running backs. \nKubinec ground out 9 yards ahead of Irwin’s 53-yard TD dash that gave the Falcons their first lead of the game, 20-14. \nWeber hit Donaldson for a 4-yard TD on the next possession and connected again on the 2-point conversion to make it 28-14 midway into the third. \n“Coming out and getting down 14-0 wasn’t really a surprise, but it stung us,” said Donaldson, who had six catches for 63 yards. “We made some simple mistakes on offense and defense. But we knew they were things that could be fixed.” \nIrwin ran for 71 yards on seven carries and Kubinec had 65 yards on eight carries. Wittman finished with 63 yards and two touchdowns, and Nick Sikora contributed 48 yards on eight carries. \n“We had them in conditions that we wanted them because they were the faster team,” Reduzzi said. “We knew where we had to run the ball and what we had to do on defense. We just have to keep trying to get better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:57:55.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
