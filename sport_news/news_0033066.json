Tui Lolohea missed a tackle on Lilley and Lilley sent Moon over for his second try in the 54th minute. \nLilley stepped up to add the conversion and gave his side the lead over their international visitors. \nHowever, the lead changed hands for a third time on the hour, when prop Jesse Bromwich charged over thanks to Kodi Nikorima's flat pass, and moments later centre Dean Whare finished off a break by Tuivasa-Sheck for the tourists' fourth try. \nThere was no way back for Leeds when Tuivasa-Sheck went over for a fifth try on 65 minutes, although guest player Ali Lauitiiti swooped on a handling error by Shaun Kenny-Dowall to get Tom Briscoe over for Leeds' third try of the night, before Nikorima and Tuivasa-Sheck added late tries for the visitors to cap off a more comfortable win than had looked possible 20 minutes before.
