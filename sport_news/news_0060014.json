Follow Troy for more daily updates on Twitter and Facebook . \nTroy, I'm sure you've noticed that some of the Broncos defensive linemen have a disturbing habit of hanging a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the team right when they've stopped the opposing team on a third-and-long situation. \nHow does the Broncos coaching staff handle that nonsense? Is it even possible to coach that type of knuckle-headery out of a player? \n— Chip Whitson, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho \nWhen the Broncos switched to an aggressive 3-4 defense, some penalties were always going to be the price of doing business. A finesse tag hung on this team the last few seasons. It wasn't considered a compliment. This defense brings toughness, intimidates opponents. \nThat said, some penalties are worse than others. There are penalties of effort and aggression and there are stupid penalties. The coaches have talked to the players about the difference repeatedly. As Von Miller told me on Tuesday, the biggest thing the Broncos defense must fix is \"penalties, mainly penalties and then penalties.\" The coaches don't want to take the wag out the defense's tail, but they desire a smart team. \nMalik Jackson tossing the ball at Oakland's Michael Crabtree and Derek Wolfe shoving Cleveland's Josh McCown to the ground late in front of the referee were foolish fouls. Those must be eliminated. Eventually, they will cost the Broncos a game. It is possible to be smart and fierce. The Broncos will find that balance. \nHas Cleveland's coach said why he decided to go for two following the Browns' touchdown late in the game? \n— William Burns, Lakewood \nThe thinking was go up by six, believing Denver couldn't score a touchdown if down 22-16. It wasn't the worst decision since the Broncos had gone 25 straight possessions — the longest streak in the NFL at that point — without scoring an offensive touchdown. It backfired when Peyton Manning connected with Emmanuel Sanders on the long touchdown. I thought the Browns chased points too early in this instance. But the decision was based on Denver's struggling offense. Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning (18) works through drills with backup quarterback Brock Osweiler (17). The Denver Broncos prepare for their upcoming game against Detroit during practice at Dove Valley on Monday, Sept. 21, 2015. ( Kathryn Scott Osler, The Denver Post ) \nWhy don't Broncos receivers go past the first-down line on third downs? I saw this at least three times during the first half. I saw it a lot last year. \n— Lawrence Kirsch, Aurora \nSome routes are designed for the receiver to catch in front of the marker and make a play after the catch. Other times, it's an oversight and the receiver cuts the route off too soon. It can be frustrating to watch, but it's not always intentional. \nWith Brandon McManus and Matt Prater before him, it seems the Broncos have done a great job in developing kickers. Obviously the high altitude helps with the distance but not the accuracy. Any explanations? Do they have an excellent kicking coach? Are they great at kicking evaluation or are they simply fortunate? \n— Steve Green, Culver, Oregon \nThe special teams coach has changed, so there's no common thread. The altitude helps, without question, whether it's hitting a baseball or booting a field goal. I would say it's more about identifying talent than developing it. The Broncos had their eye on McManus long before they traded for him. McManus struggled last year, but made a mechanical adjustment, going to a two-step approach. It didn't compromise his leg strength while making him more accurate. \nTroy, the Broncos are the worst 6-0 team remaining. Without Wade Phillips, the team could easily be 0-6. Is Peyton allowed to call his own plays? Is Peyton allowed to change the play call? Is age catching up to Peyton quicker than we thought it would? If this team had Adam Gase running the offense and Wade Phillips running the defense, this team might be unbeatable! Thoughts? \n— Brad Byers, Las Vegas \nThe hypothetical scenario is fascinating, but a fantasy. The 2013 Broncos' offense isn't walking out of the locker room. And I would say that if the Broncos had their 2013 offense, their defense would be weakened. That Broncos offense excelled at short drives, rarely staying on the field even five minutes. It left Denver's defense on the field too much, exposing a rather vanilla scheme to big plays. \nManning gives his feedback in the offense. Coach Gary Kubiak remains committed to putting Manning in the best position. Manning hasn't played well, committing too many turnovers. He continues to audible in this offense, and not just to pass plays. Going back to the old offense won't solve all the issues. That offense had Pro Bowl tight end Julius Thomas, and in 2013, a productive Wes Welker. The personnel is different. I realize how frustrating this offense can be to watch — my email is a testament to the anger — but the Broncos aren't going to reinvent themselves at this point in the season. \nWATCH: What is the best thing Gary Kubiak can do for Peyton Manning? \nTroy, when will Gary Kubiak be held accountable for the Broncos' offensive woes? It seems when he was hired that he promised to build his offensive philosophy around Peyton's strengths. Do you believe he has done that? It doesn't seem so. Why has John Elway been so quiet about this? \n— Bill F., Loveland \nKubiak holds himself accountable for the offensive woes. He hasn't hidden from the lack of success or made excuses. He has bent to try and make Manning comfortable, while still keeping a semblance of a running game. The Broncos proved the last few years that they can't win a Super Bowl with the best offense in football. They wanted a more balanced attack which would allow them to run when they wanted to, not when they had to. \nWe've only recently seen glimpses of that as the Broncos ran well at Cleveland, though the Browns' allowed 5.0 yards per carry entering the game. \nAs for Elway, he doesn't provide weekly assessments of the team. He said in training camp that the offense would be a work in progress, recognizing that Manning is used to carrying a team by itself. Denver no longer needs that. \nThe Broncos need Manning to get them in the right plays, protect the ball, and deliver the clutch drive when necessary. \nCan and should Denver trade for Steve Smith? Like now, during their bye week. \n— Tom, Simi Valley, California \nIf the Broncos were to make a move, tight end is a more pressing need than receiver. Smith is a great player, but the Broncos are having trouble involving a third receiver at this point. They need more production from the tight end. Couldn't hurt to call St. Louis about Jared Cook or San Francisco about Vernon Davis, right? Problem is those teams can make an argument they are still in contention. In absence of a move, the Broncos need to figure out a way to get Owen Daniels and Virgil Green more targets. \nHow cruel is it that Manning has been been paired with the best defense of his career just as his body seems to be failing him? \n— James Kane, Bonnie, Scotland \nIt is a wicked irony. But this is typically the case. Rarely do teams have the best offense and top defense. At 39, Manning remains challenged. He is fighting against time. But can he become comfortable to be efficient in this offense? His teammates and coaches believe in him. They don't need Manning to carry the load anymore. Just do his part. \nAm I the only one seeing similarities between this year and the 2009 season? Broncos had the best defense since Orange Crush then and went 6-0 in 2009. No one cared about a mediocre offense led by pedestrian quarterback and the team ended 8-8. I am seeing deja vu. All the issues with running game, no yards after catch on short routes starts and ends with Peyton Manning. \n— Vijay, Alpharetta, Georgia \nI see no similarities because Josh McDaniels ran the team with paranoia and immaturity. He was overmatched, leaving a single pull of a loose thread unraveling the sweater. Kubiak provides a calming presence while issuing strong evaluations. \nThe Broncos will lose some of their remaining games. But given the strength of their defense, they can be a 12 to 13-win team with a mediocre offense. And remember of their six wins, four have come on the road. Everyone says they haven't beaten anyone. That's fair. But it also applies to the other undefeated teams. \nThe Broncos and Patriots are the only perfect teams who own a win against an opponent with a winning record. Denver beat Minnesota, and the Patriots topped Pittsburgh. So all the undefeated teams have flaws, even if the Patriots have fewer than others. \nI think the running issues originate from a lack of cohesiveness in the offensive line. The offensive line coach may need some help, any chance the Broncos bring back Alex Gibbs to help shape the line. It seems that he did a very good job last time he was in Denver. \nAlso, it is obvious Manning is struggling from the current formations, why not scrap everything and open up the books from last year. If Manning fails then, we will all know that he is done but not until he gets a fair chance. \n— Jose, Miami \nThe lack of continuity on Sundays and during the week has slowed the line's growth. The group played its best game at Cleveland. Yes, the Browns' run defense stinks. But the film showed a Broncos line eliminating mistakes it made earlier in the season. \nThe expectation is that the Broncos will return from the bye week with Louis Vasquez, Evan Mathis and Ty Sambrailo all practicing. It should help accelerate the improvement needed with the schedule growing tougher. There's no talk of bringing in Alex Gibbs. Offensive coordinator Rick Dennison learned under Gibbs. I contend that this isn't a teaching issue, it's a personnel issue. The Broncos are trying to make mismatched parts fit. The bye week offers a chance to streamline what the team does well, and junk what hasn't. \nAs I have said before, going back to last season's offense doesn't make sense for a number of reasons: this team doesn't have Julius Thomas, Wes Welker and shorter drives would only compromise the team's greatest strength, its defense. \nDenver Post Broncos writer Troy Renck posts his Broncos Mailbag on Wednesdays during the season. \nYou can pose a Broncos- or NFL-related question for the Broncos Mailbag here.
