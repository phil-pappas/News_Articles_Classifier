The Toronto native did not exactly set the world aflame in his first season, finishing with nine goals and 32 points. But he caught fire in good time, busting out for 29 goals his next season and igniting a prolific pattern of consistent goal-scoring and point production that few defencemen have been able to match at the NHL level. \nCoffey, of course, was integral to the Oilers dynasty of the '80s alongside Wayne Gretzky and Co. The 54-year-old wrapped up a 21-year career having lifted the Stanley Cup on four occasions (three times with Edmonton, once with Pittsburgh), capturing three Norris Memorial Trophies as the league's top defenceman, amassing 14 all-star game selections and establishing multiple scoring records along the way, while also enjoying success at the international level as a three-time Canada Cup gold medalist. \nHe was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004, alongside fellow superstar defencemen Ray Bourque and Larry Murphy. \nOn Wednesday at Ryerson University's Mattamy Athletic Centre, located at the site of the former Maple Leaf Gardens, Coffey was honoured once more, highlighting a group of 12 new inductees that make up Canada's Sports Hall of Fame's class of 2015. \n\"The flag is what it's all about,\" said Coffey, whose emotions got the best of him while addressing those on hand for Wednesday's official ceremony. \"It's a great honour. When I (found out about this induction), I started doing some research on it. It's a pretty special place.\" \nCoffey was in a special place back in 1980, having been drafted in the first round by the Oilers that year - sixth overall. If the pressure was on then for the swift-skating blue-liner to produce, it is similarly so for teen sensation Connor McDavid more than three decades later, albeit at an amplified level. \n\"I pretty much carried that through my whole career. I think that's what motivates you,\" said Coffey. \"You tell yourself all you want, you're not going to listen to (everything outside), that it doesn't bother you when you're not doing well, but it does. Pressure is something you put on yourself. If you prepare properly and you go out and play, you're ready to play, a lot of that stuff takes care of itself.\" \nThe Oilers are perhaps in a spot similar to Coffey's first NHL club - a young, mistake-prone team on the cusp of something special, if and once everything clicks. \nMuch of that pending success might hinge on the success of wonder kid forward McDavid, drafted first overall in 2015 and referred to by some as 'McJesus.' But the rookie will have to find his own way like everyone else, said Coffey, who roomed with Jarri Kurri his first few seasons in Edmonton and \"was lucky enough to play with a team, as we all are, that lived and died with the young guy's mistakes.\" \n\"That first year, up until Christmas, was a little bit of a struggle. Being away from home, having to adapt. It's not easy,\" Coffey said of his rookie campaign, spent under the microscope. \"But we had a great group of guys, a great team. We all got each other through it. \n\"Every now and then these guys do come along,\" Coffey added of McDavid, who he has met and follows with great interest. \"A guy like Connor McDavid has had those expectations on him, probably since he was a peewee, and just continually got better and better and better. Can you imagine in seven years when he's 25? The guy's going to be incredible.\" \nCoffey, who on Tuesday was joined by his wife, Stephanie, daughter, Savannah, and sons, Christian and Blake, recorded his first NHL goal 35 years ago this hump day. \n\"I can't remember who gave me the pass, but I took a slapshot from the point,\" Coffey said. \"I think it went this side, maybe this side. Top corner, against Calgary. That was fun.\" \nLike the elder Oiler, McDavid, the first overall draft pick in 2015, had his coming-out party in the Battle of Alberta, scoring a pair of goals to lift the Oilers to a 5-2 win over the rival Flames this past weekend. \n\"He's not going to be, skillwise, astronomically any better,\" Coffey predicted. \"He's just going to be smarter. He's just going to figure the game out, figure the travel out, figure everything out. \n\"Wayne and all these great players will tell him the same thing. He's a special kid. This didn't just happen today. He all of a sudden didn't just get drafted into the NHL on a hot streak and now he's got pressure on him,\" Coffey said. \"He's in a great environment. He's in a great city. He's with a team that understands. He'll be fine.\" \nHALL OF A GROUP \nMarina van der Merwe said it's like Christmas, Craig Forrest hopes it would \"inspire the next generation,\" and Danielle Goyette said it's a \"chance to celebrate a big journey.\" \nIt is perhaps all of those things and more for the 12 individuals who on Wednesday were recognized for their contribution to sport in Canada via induction into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. \nThe class of 2015 was officially fitted for commemorate jackets during a morning news conference at Ryerson University's Mattamy Athletic Centre with the support of title sponsor Canadian Tire and emcee Mark Tewksbury leading the proceedings. An official induction ceremony for the largest class in the Hall's history was held in the evening as the Hall marked its 60th anniversary. \nSpeed skater Susan Auch, former NHLer Paul Coffey, Paralympic swimmer Michael Edgson, former EPL and Canadian national soccer team goalkeeper Forrest, and Olympic medalists Nicolas Gill (judo), Goyette (women's hockey), Lori-Ann Muenzer (cycling) and Jennifer Heil (freestyle skiing), and the late Shirley Firth and her twin Sharon (cross-country skiing), joined builder-category inductees Jocelyne Bourassa (golf) and van der Mewe (field hockey coach). \nCanada's Sports Hall of Fame facility is located at the WinSport Canada Olympic Park in Calgary and features 605 inductees representing 65 sports.
