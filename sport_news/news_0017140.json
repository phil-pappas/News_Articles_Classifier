His keen eye for counting baseballs paid off.\n\"I was thinking, 'I won tickets? Really?’ My wife was sitting there, I showed it to her and said ‘I've won tickets!’\" Holland said.\nHis son Adam soon got a call.\n“My wife sent me a text and said, ‘You need to call me.’ She said ‘Can you get off work tomorrow?’ I said ‘I guess I can.’ She said ‘You’re going to a ball game.’ I was just stunned,” Adam Holland said.\nThe tickets meant a lot to David Holland, who’s been a Royals fan since the 1970s.\n\"Six months old when I brought him to his first game,\" David Holland said.\nAdam Holland has been a fan practically since birth, but neither he nor his father have ever seen a postseason game in person.\n\"I think it's special. I really think it's special,\" David Holland said.\n\"This is going to be a fun time for us after all these years of watching them play,\" Adam Holland said.\nDavid Holland drove the more than four hour round trip from Erie to Kauffman Stadium.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
