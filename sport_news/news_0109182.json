(Photo: Clarence Tabb Jr., Detroit News) \nCONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Auburn Hills — Pistons center Andre Drummond, who will be a restricted free agent after this season, has decided to wait until next summer for a potential big pay day.\nDrummond, starting his fourth season, is in line for a maximum deal likely in the neighborhood of five years and $120 million. The Pistons had until Nov. 2 to try to sign him to an extension or wait until after the season.\nPistons president and coach Stan Van Gundy announced Tuesday afternoon that Drummond had decided to wait until after the season to continue contract talks on that deal. Drummond’s relationship with Pistons owner Tom Gores is the key to the negotiations.\nWaiting gives the Pistons more flexibility in signing free agents or pursuing trades. If Drummond had signed a new extension before the Nov. 2 deadline, it would cost the Pistons an additional $12.7 million, approximately, against the cap. By waiting, the savings will allow Gundy to build around Drummond with more talent.\n“Andre has decided to delay negotiations until next summer,” Van Gundy said. “Andre wants to be here long term and we definitely want him here long term but after talking to Tom, Andre realized that our best chance to build a contender was to have the additional cap-space flexibility next year.”\nThe cap flexibility will be critical in getting top-tier free agents to come to the Pistons, who haven’t made the playoffs in six seasons. Their young nucleus of Drummond, Reggie Jackson, Stanley Johnson, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Marcus Morris could be enhanced by a seasoned veteran, which the added cap money could help facilitate.\nThe move also shows the faith that Drummond has in Gores in trying to build around one of the top young centers — and young players — in the league. Van Gundy said that Drummond and Gores have had several discussions about the potential extension, but Drummond decided to put off the negotiations.\n“One of the conversations we had is really giving ourselves the flexibility to build this team up and do the right things to get us to where we need to be,” Drummond said. “Getting that off the table now and going into the season, I have a clearer head and I’m ready to be a leader for this team.\n“We had a discussion and we all came to an understanding of what needed to be done and we’re just going to move forward and get ready for the season.”\nThe Pistons signed Jackson to a five-year, $80-million deal in the offseason, giving Drummond a good pick-and-roll complement, and with drafting Johnson this year, the pieces are starting to fall into place.\nAlthough Drummond is in line for a huge payday, he wasn’t ready to rush it — nor to put the team in a tough position in terms of the cap.\n“It shows a sign of maturity on my side to take that leap and give my team a chance to build what we have here,” Drummond said. “Would it be nice to have it? Absolutely, but that’s not the point right now. I’m into winning and trying to make my team as good as possible.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:41:26.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
