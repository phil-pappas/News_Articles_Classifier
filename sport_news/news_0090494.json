Jeff Carter added an even strength goal 3:46 into the second period to put the Sharks down 3-0. Los Angeles Kings' Milan Lucic (17) score second goal against San Jose Sharks goalie Martin Jones (31) in the first period at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015. (Josie Lepe/Bay Area News Group) ( Josie Lepe ) \n\"You either get a big kill or you get a big power-play goal and change the momentum of the game, and we didn't,\" Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said. \"We had that working for us when we were winning games a week and a half ago. It's not right now, so we have to get it back.\" \nJoel Ward scored at the 15:06 mark of the second period to give San Jose some life. But Sharks goalie Martin Jones let in four goals on the first 26 shots he faced, including a fluky power play goal in the third period by Carter in which his shot went wide of the net, bounced back, hit Jones on the shoulder and bounced into the net. \n\"I think the hockey gods are just testing us right now,\" Ward said of Carter's goal. Advertisement \nGoalie Jhonas Enroth finished with 39 saves for the Kings. Enroth was making his first start of the season but entered Thursday with a 3-0 lifetime record and a 1.24 goals against average against the Sharks in four games. \nThe Sharks had an 18-8 edge in shots on goal in the first period, but Los Angeles opened the scoring on a transition play as Alec Martinez's pass from inside the Kings zone went over the outstretched arm of Brent Burns in the neutral zone. Tyler Toffoli picked up the puck in the Sharks zone and on a 2-on-1, skated toward the San Jose net and beat Jones with a nifty move 11:37 into the game. \nJoe Thornton left the game with 1:55 left in the first period after absorbing a hit from Jake Muzzin and landing awkwardly on the ice. Thornton looked shaky as he skated off and headed straight to the dressing room. Thornton was cleared to play after passing the NHL's concussion protocol, according to DeBoer, and returned to the ice a little more than three minutes into the second period, temporarily allaying any fears that the Sharks would lose another player. \nGoing into Thursday, four players who were on the team when training camp ended are now out of action. Paul Martin suffered a lower body injury against the New Jersey Devils. He skated Thursday morning and is improving but is day-to-day. Ben Smith was cut inside his hear by a puck against the New York Islanders, and Joonas Donskoi has a nagging lower body injury. \nThey'll all presumably be back before Logan Couture, who is out another month with a fractured right fibula. \n\"Everybody deals with injuries, and we've got our share of guys out, but you have to find a way,\" DeBoer said. \"We had 18 shots in the first period, and I thought we were a little unfortunate to be down at that point.\" \nThe Sharks were 3 of 19 on the power play entering Thursday, as they struggled not only to draw penalties, but also to convert once they get the man advantage. \nWith Donskoi and Smith out, Bryan Lerg was recalled from the Barracuda and was on a line with Mike Brown and Micheal Haley. Lerg was sent down on Wednesday, had a goal and an assist for the Barracuda that night in its 3-2 shootout loss to San Diego, and was brought back up to face the Kings.
