(Photo: Doug McSchooler/for The Star) Buy Photo \nBLOOMINGTON — The T-shirt that will be hanging in Jordan Howard’s locker this weekend used to be a cleaner shade of white. It also used to have sleeves. Its sides weren’t cut out then either, but a boy does a lot of growing from 12 to 20. The shirt has traveled with Howard from youth football to Gardendale High School, then the University of Alabama-Birmingham, and finally the 470-odd miles up I-65 to Bloomington, where Howard is quietly becoming a Heisman Trophy candidate this fall. On it is a picture of a man as important to Jordan's life and career as anyone. A man who has never seen him play a down in college. Jordan needed more than a year to convince his parents to let him play football. When they finally agreed, Reginald Howard, his father, supported his youngest child to the hilt. Jordan lived his entire life in Birmingham until the university ended its football program last winter. Now, he’s fast becoming a fan favorite in Bloomington on an Indiana University football team generating more excitement than at any other time in recent memory. He's the nation's leading rusher and a key reason there's a touch of optimism as IU opens league play against No. 1 Ohio State on Saturday. Through all that, one thing hasn’t changed: Jordan Howard has lived nearly as much of his life without his father as with him, but no one stays closer to his heart. “His father was very instrumental in his life, and especially his football life,” said Flora Williams, Howard’s mother. “They were basically best friends.” \nJordan Howard was Flora Williams' and Reginald Howard's youngest child. He grew up to be a 230-pound running back, and now, the nation's leading rusher. (Photo: Submitted to The Star) REFLECTION \nReginald Howard was a dentist. His nickname was “Doc.” \nAnd he had a son who loved football, the same sport he had played at Tuskegee University. \nJordan first asked his parents to let him play organized football when he was 7. They told him no, but Jordan persisted. When the local league season rolled back around a year later, he asked again. \nFlora and Reginald relented. \nHoward was always among the largest children his age, according to his mother, so when he joined up, his new coaches said they’d make him a lineman. He wanted none of it. Running back or bust. \n: Howard needed more than a year to convince his parents to let him play football. Even at 8 years old, his nickname was \"The Bulldozer.\" (Photo: Submitted to The Star) \nHoward agreed to race some of his would-be teammates, to prove he was fast enough. And though he won — the race and the running back job — his power was always his greatest strength. \n“Even in little league, some of the parents would refer to him as ‘The Bulldozer,’ ” Williams said, laughing. \nReginald was a quiet man, more about actions than words. If he didn’t know you, he might not say much. But if he did, you could count on him to be honest and kind. \n“Everybody tells me I act just like him and look like him,” Jordan Howard said. “He was a pretty great guy. He wouldn’t really say much if he didn’t know you. I’m kind of the same way. But he was really genuine, down to earth.” \nWhen Jordan was young, his parents wouldn’t let him attend a practice alone. One of them always went. Reginald took it further, working with Jordan at home. \n“His father was his greatest supporter, before anybody else realized his athletic ability,” Williams said. \nAt the time, Williams believed Reginald was just a typical father, fretting over his son. But not long ago, she found a letter Reginald had written to Jordan when he was still a boy. \n“In my book,” the letter read, “you’re the greatest of all time.” IndyStar Sports Day Podcast: Does IU have a chance vs. Ohio State? UNEXPECTED MOVE \nA hip injury kept Howard off the camp circuit during the summer between his junior and senior high school seasons, costing him valuable exposure. Despite rushing for nearly 1,400 yards and 21 touchdowns as a senior at Gardendale, north of Birmingham, only UAB extended a scholarship. \nSo Howard stayed home for college, establishing himself as one of the best running backs in the country. Williams called it “divine intervention.” \nA different kind of intervention bent Howard’s career sideways last December. \nCiting financial concerns, UAB closed down its football program. . \nDeland McCullough, IU’s running backs coach, was in Baltimore on a recruiting trip when he heard the news.. He called IU head coach Kevin Wilson. When could McCullough to see Howard? While Wilson got an answer from his compliance department, McCullough got on a plane. \nCollege football coaches flooded Birmingham. An ESPN report described a “coaches’ convention at the Birmingham airport.” Howard and his teammates needed new homes, and because the program was being shut down, they would be immediately eligible. \nMcCullough’s quick thinking beat the traffic. \n“I was the first coach to talk to Jordan,” he said. “When I got there, I went straight to Jordan’s house. There wasn’t a coaches’ convention there. It was coach McCullough.” \nOver chicken wings and video games, McCullough bonded with Howard. He was impressed both by Howard’s self-awareness — he talked openly about weaknesses he needed to address — and by his football savvy. IU football: Darius Latham suspended indefinitely \nWilliams counseled her son to “go where people want you.” McCullough wanted Howard, badly. \nHe visited three times. When Williams asked questions about her son’s academics, McCullough came back with a plan for the rest of his college career. Williams even met McCullough's wife. \n“I felt comfortable letting him coach Jordan,” Williams said. \nWhen Wilson made his in-home visit, he kept things straightforward: \nThere’s a good chance Tevin Coleman might leave, and we think Jordan could thrive as his successor. \nBeating off interest from Notre Dame, Wisconsin and Vanderbilt, the Hoosiers landed their new tailback. Howard packed for Bloomington. The faded white T-shirt came with him. IU pass rush finally finds results THE T-SHIRT \nReginald Howard died on Jan. 31, 2007, of pulmonary fibrosis. His obituary said he passed \"after a long illness.\" \nIt also said he was “passionate in his love for his children.” \nJordan was 12. \n“Jordan lost his grandmother, his grandfather and his father in a six-month span,” Williams said. “It was very hard on him, but I think he kept himself busy. … It was very difficult.” \nJordan poured his energy into football, but never forgot his father. When he was 15, he had his name legally changed — he’s now Jordan Reginald Howard. \nBut the T-shirt came first. Jordan pulled it on for his first game after his father's passing, and it has traced the steps of his career since. \nOn it, there's a photo of Reginald wearing a tuxedo, smiling widely. The smile Williams said Jordan inherited from his father. \nAnd, like his father, Jordan doesn’t say much. In front of a camera, his answers are usually no more than one or two sentences. \nHow does it feel to win Big Ten offensive player of the week? \n“It feels good, but it’s not all about me. I get the accolades and stuff, but like I said before, it’s not all about me. It’s about the team.” \nWhat’s the buzz like, having the No. 1 team coming in this Saturday, being undefeated? \n“The buzz is pretty high, but we can’t get overhyped. We’ve got to take it one game at a time, treat it as a regular game.” \nOn the field, Howard is no-nonsense. As Marqui Hawkins, Howard’s teammate at UAB and now IU, describes it: “When it’s football, he’s strictly about business.” \nBut like his father, Howard has another side, one that teammate Devine Redding can’t help but laugh about. \nOff the field? \"He’s a playful, joyful guy,\" said Redding, Indiana's other primary running back. \"He’ll never be walking around with his head down. He’s always smiling.\" \nAlways smiling. Just like Reginald, in the photo his son wears on his chest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:23:08.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
