However, he later developed complications, after returning to Nigeria about two weeks ago. \n“He was rushed to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital on Monday, and when his condition deteriorated on Wednesday, he was placed on oxygen. The family wishes to commend the management and consultants at LASUTH for a tremendous job they did to try and keep him alive, but he gave up on Friday night,” Ilaboya told the NFF official website. \nNFF President Amaju Pinnick, who is in Belgium for the Super Eagles’ friendly match against Cameroon on Sunday, expressed sorrow over Okugbe’s passing. \n“He was no doubt one of the most resourceful, dedicated and gifted journalists around. He had real passion for the job. I spoke to him while he was in India for the surgery and I thought all was well with him again. \n“It is a sad situation, but we pray that God Almighty will grant him eternal rest and also grant the family he has left behind the fortitude to bear the loss.” \nOkugbe, 51, left behind a wife and three children. Burial plans will be announced by his family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:14:20.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
