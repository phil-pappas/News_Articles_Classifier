Comment   Randy Hogan Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 3:06 PM By Randy Hogan Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 3:06 PM Blues and Friday night football have been a winning combination in Phillips County going on 30 years now and tonight should be no different. Three of Phillips County’s high school teams play at home this weekend and it appears as though Mother Nature is going to cooperate with fall football and October Blues. Barton plays host to Mayflower. DeSoto takes on Kirk Academy at Sam Howe Field and Palestine-Wheatley comes to Marvell. Meanwhile, the Central High School Cougars will hit the road and head for Searcy to challenge the Riverview Raiders in a big conference matchup for both schools. Marvell Academy hopes to keep its perfect 6-0 record intact as they journey to Pheba, Mississippi to battle another flock of Eagles in a non-conference clash. Harding Academy dominated Barton, 2-3, 0-2, in almost every facet of the game last Friday evening at Searcy. The Bears had two long impressive first quarter drives but came up empty both times. The Wildcats eventually scored the first 36 points of the contest to win going away, 43-13. The Mercy Rule kept things from getting any worse. Barton did not get on the scoreboard until late in the third quarter on a 72-yard touchdown run by Bradley Smith. Josh Cannon later connected with Kedarius Davis for a touchdown pass play covering 63 yards with the game clock winding down. Mayflower comes into Friday night’s came with an identical 2-3 overall record but is sporting a 2-0 mark in 2-3A Conference activity. Last week the Eagles posted a 40-20 victory over Perryville and they crushed the Rose Bud Ramblers the week before. The Eagles were 9-4 in 2014 good enough for a second place conference finish. They survived to the third round of the playoffs before bowing to Episcopal, 47-34. Barton will be challenged by this high-octane offense that scores plenty of points. Mayflower won last year’s meeting, 56-39 at Mayflower. The game is a huge one for the Bears who are hoping to salvage a disappointing season so far and keep their playoff hopes alive. Central, 2-3, 1-1, is still smarting after a disappointing 17-15 loss to Central Arkansas Christian at Cad Polk Stadium. It was contest in which the defense made numerous impressive stands but the offensive was unable to generate very much spark. Malik Arnett ran for a 29-yard score after setting up the score with a 47-yard pass to Markease Williams. Markehlee Harvey scored Central’s other touchdown on an 11-yard run. Riverview, 3-2, 1-1, blanked Southside 17-0 last Friday night. The Raiders were 2-8 a year ago and did not reach the playoffs. The Cougars dominated last year’s meeting by a 52-26 score. Friday’s showdown is a big game for both squads. Page 2 of 2 - Marvell Academy, 6-0, 1-0, may face their toughest challenge of the season tonight against Hebron Christian Academy, 5-1. Marvell Academy rolled up 50 points en route to a shutout over the Strider Academy Rams. The Eagles got balanced offense spreading out some impressive individual stats among Morgan Steeland, Caleb Gannon and Jacob Cox. Steeland rushed five times for 85 yards and three scores. Gannon rolled up 61 yards on four carries for two touchdowns. Cox amassed 34 yards and a touchdown. Central Holmes rolled over the DeSoto Thunderbirds, 40-6, dipping the T-Birds record to .500 at 4-4. The Kirk Academy Raiders are 2-5 overall and 0-3 in their conference. Marvell’s Mustangs, 0-5, 0-3, are home at the Palestine-Wheatley Patriots, 2-3, 1-3. The Carlisle Bison pounded Marvell, 62-14 last Friday. The McCrory Jaguars soundly beat the Patriots, 42-14 a week ago. Palestine-Wheatley won last year’s meeting, 46-20.
