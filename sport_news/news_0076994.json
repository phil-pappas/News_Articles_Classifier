I am so thankful to family, friends and fans, who have sent nothing but prayers and well wishes to Lamar,\" she wrote. Odom was being cared for at Sunrise Hospital until late Monday when TMZ reports he was transferred to a hospital in Los Angeles. \"I also want to take a moment to thank everyone at Sunrise Hospital, including the amazing doctors and nurses for their kindness and diligent work. Under their amazing care, incredible strides have been made. You can never be prepared for an experience like this, but without the outpouring of love and endless prayers that Lamar has received and the strength I was given from my loved ones, it would have been difficult to endure. Thank you for your continued support. God is great!!!\" wrote Kardashian.Family was the first to report that Odom woke up from his four day coma on Friday.
