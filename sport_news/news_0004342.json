The Blue Jays did not specify the severity of his injury. \nCliff Pennington took over at third base in the sixth. \nDonaldson hit .297 with a career-high 41 homers this season and led the AL with 123 RBIs. \nEarlier, Texas lost third baseman Adrian Beltre to back soreness after he landed heavily sliding into second base.
