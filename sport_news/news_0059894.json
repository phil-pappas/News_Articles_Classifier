Leon Cannizzaro to correct what the board calls a \"culture of negligence and outright dishonesty\" it says has pervaded the D.A. office for decades.\nThe editorial notes 36 convictions that have been overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct. Many of those cases were handled during Harry Connick's time as D.A.\nWe asked the D.A. office to comment on the editorial. We have not heard from the office yet.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
