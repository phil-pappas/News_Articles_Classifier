The $100 million jet sustained significant damage, forcing it to jettison its fuel tanks and munitions before returning to base, officials confirmed to AFP. The attack occurred last Tuesday in the Sayid Karam district of eastern Paktia province, much of which is under control of the Taliban, who have been waging an insurgency against US-led NATO forces and government troops since they were forced from power in 2001. The militant group claimed they had downed the jet in a statement posted on Twitter that evening, but when contacted for comment, the US military initially said it had no \"operational reporting to support the Taliban claims\". â€” AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:06:07.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
