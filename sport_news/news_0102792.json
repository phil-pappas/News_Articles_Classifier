I'm excited for the opportunity that he has there.\" \nFor Locklsey, it's a chance to hit the reset switch. His first turn as a head coach at New Mexico ended in less than three years because of on-field struggles and off-field incidents. Locksley went 2-26 as head coach at New Mexico, being fired in early 2011 after starting that season 0-4. \nHe returned to Maryland the following year as offensive coordinator under former head coach Randy Edsall. Two weeks ago, Locksley became Maryland's interim coach when Edsall was fired. \n\"A team takes on the personality of its leader,\" Locksley said, \"and with me being the leader for the next six to seven weeks, you need to lighten the mood up a little bit. I don't want our guys playing tight. I don't want them thinking that they have to go out and play to win, to save people's jobs, or to get a guy a job. I want them to go play football in its purist form, and that's what I've talked about each day with these guys.\" \nSometimes, after coaching changes, players unwind from their recent struggles and play more freely. The Terps, who did not play last week, have had two weeks to adjust to Locksley. As a result, Franklin anticipates a reckless Maryland to surface Saturday. \nWhat does that mean? Trick plays, Franklin said, maybe an onside kick. The coach expects Maryland to take plenty of \"calculated risks.\" \n\"They've got an opportunity to play Penn State and obviously get a win that's really important to them,\" Franklin said, \"and I could see them doing whatever they have to do to get it.\" \nOne thing Locksley did was take a more subdued tone toward any projected Penn State-Maryland hostility. \"Let the rivalry begin now,\" Edsall said after Maryland's 20-19 win last year in State College, which was one of the high points of his tenure in College Park. \nThat isn't Locksley. He praised Franklin —\"From afar, I've seen how he's matured and grown as a coach,\" Locksley said — and promised that the Terps would participate in the pre-game handshake this time. \nBut he also has been busy trying to restore his team's capacity to believe in itself. \n\"We have the underdog mentality,\" Locksley said. \"Right now, I'm sure there're not that many people that give us a chance to go out and have any success, but our guys are resilient. We have a really good core set of players that I think you'll see on Saturday.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:45:08.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
