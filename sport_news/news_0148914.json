Green is rated as the No. 10 dual-threat quarterback in the country by Rivals, while Wilson is ranked No. 12 at his position and No. 214 overall by ESPN .\nGiven Green's on-field struggles and the Ducks' recruitment of a second signal-caller, a mutual parting of ways doesn't seem far-fetched, which is why the rumor that Green had de-committed spread like wildfire this weekend on message boards and social media.\nIt didn't help matters that Green removed all the information from his Twitter bio, including the message that he was committed to Oregon.\nDespite the rumors and the profile change, however, Green said over the weekend that his relationship with the Ducks was \"still good\" and that he \"(hasn't) de-committed.\"\nStill, that possibility remains in play.\nFellow commits have indicated that Green's certainty about a future in Eugene has wavered in recent weeks and that they aren't sure where he'll end up.\nWhere there's this much smoke, there's typically fire.\nConsider Green a wait-and-see commit until signing day from here on out.\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec", "http://sports.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/player-Seth-Green-151562", "http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/203272/terry-wilson"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:35:27.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
