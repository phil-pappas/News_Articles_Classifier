As the two teams face off on Sunday, their evasive maneuvers have been on full display this week.\nWhen asked by a reporter Wednesday if anyone has pulled him aside at the grocery store and urged him to kick Indy’s butt, Bill Belichick said, “I haven’t been to the grocery store in a couple years.”\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The next question was whether he was hearing from friends, family, neighbors.\n“Have I heard from my family and friends? Yeah, sure,” Belichick said.\nIt was only the beginning.\nBelichick’s mentee of evasive speech tactics, Tom Brady, was up to the podium next. Like the interview with Belichick, no reporter said the word, “Deflategate,” according to the team’s official transcript. But many asked whether his approach for the Colts was different than other weeks.\n“I’m always pretty motivated,” he said. “I try certainly, to be a professional with how I approach every week.”\nThe interview was robotic.\n“Isn’t there any human part of you that wants it a little extra this week?” a reporter asked.\n“I’m a human. There’s no doubt. I’m definitely human,” Brady said.\nNo one had doubted it—except, perhaps, until now.\nMeanwhile, in the Colts locker room, it was as if Deflategate barely happened.\n“What distractions? We haven’t really talked about that,” Colts running back Frank Gore said.\nTight end Dwayne Allen didn’t seem particularly aware of the Patriots’ existence—let alone a ball deflating scandal implicating the quarterback he’d play against on Sunday night.\n“I’m not sure,” Allen said, when asked who he was playing next week. “It’s the next game. Nameless, faceless opponents.”\nWhat kind of film study was he attending?\nCasting the “Deflategate” movie\nPrevious -- of -- Next Ben Affleck as Tom Brady: If Ben can don Batman's cape and cowl, the \"Good Will Hunting\" co-conspiritor has as good a shot as anyone at filling the No. 12 jersey. and Chris Pizzello / AP Previous -- of -- Next Steve Buscemi as Tom Brady Sketch: If Buscemi is the first actor to audition for the role of Brady Sketch 1, then all others would be sent home immediately.
