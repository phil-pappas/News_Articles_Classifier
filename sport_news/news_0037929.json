By Megan Crotty mcrotty@courier-tribune.com Twitter: @MeganCrottyCT \nASHEBORO — With the Asheboro High School gym decked out in pink for Dig Pink Night, the Blue Comets varsity volleyball team hosted Eastern Randolph in what turned out to be a nailbiter. \nIn the end, AHS edged the Wildcats 25-19, 25-23, 25-27, 25-20 to finish the regular season with an 18-3 overall record. \n“I scheduled our non-conference teams because I knew they’d be great competition for us,” Blue Comets coach Karen Blanchard said. “Eastern Randolph showed us there are things we do need to work on. They changed their offenses and defenses and we had to adjust. … Both teams played so well, it came down to who was going to mess up. I told them, ‘We don’t want it to be our mistake.’ ” \nAfter winning the first two sets, AHS took an early 8-4 lead. ER responded with a 4-0 run that knotted the set at 10-all, but the Blue Comets stayed ahead with a streak of their own. The Wildcats then outscored AHS 8-1 to go ahead 19-16. The Blue Comets tied the score four times — the last at 25-all — before they were called for two hits to put ER ahead 26-25. A Victoria Gardner kill cut the AHS match lead to 2-1. \nIn the fourth set, the Wildcats led by as many as three points early, but the Blue Comets came back and took the lead on a long-hit ER ball. Ashley Ledbetter’s block put the Wildcats ahead 10-9, but AHS scored the next two points to retake the lead. ER tied the score four times before the Blue Comets went on a 6-0 run to close out the set and win the match. \n“Last night we played a must-win conference match and tonight, it’s just a different mentality,” said ER coach Lora Ritter, whose team fell to 13-5. “It’s a different feel. If we had played our game on offense or defense, things would have gone much better. We made more mistakes than we usually do. Nobody wanted to pick up the ball — we didn’t have that same intensity.” \nSalem Davidson paced AHS with 18 kills and 11 digs, while Emily Skoglund had 21 digs. Gilliam Foscue dished out 29 assists, and Hannah Ferguson handed out 18. Jasmine Gaines had 12 kills, while Megan Banker notched seven. \nFor ER, Christian Ritter had 20 kills and 28 digs, and Ledbetter notched 11 kills, 12 digs and nine blocks. Gardner had seven kills and 22 digs, and Kella Goins notched 17 digs with Morgan Kinney adding 10. \nThe Wildcats host High Point Andrews tonight, while the Blue Comets play in the Mid-Piedmont Conference Tournament next week. \nn In jayvee action, AHS won 25-8, 25-17. \nSammi Underwood had nine service points and 11 assists for the Blue Comets (17-4), while Mary Cate Kovash had four service points, four digs and five kills. Chloe Smith added four points and two kills \nFor the Wildcats (7-10), Kayla Long and Erika Rush each had three kills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:41:56.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
