He later came down on his own. Demolition of the house to make way for a 30-unit apartment complex resumed Friday.\nWorkers resumed demolishing the stately, if care-worn, house at 3423 S.E. Hawthorne Blvd. on Friday morning, a day after a squatter climbed on the home's roof to prevent its demise.\nThe 2,664-square-foot house, which has been vacant since being sold for $900,000 in July, was built in 1909, but had clearly seen better days. When it's gone, developers plan to build a five-story, 30-unit apartment complex on the site. The plans call for on-site bicycle parking, but no on-site car parking.\nThe owner is listed as Victor Suk Takla of Portland and the contractor is MCH Construction of Beaverton, according to City of Portland permits issued in August.\nRather than a protest about developers removing historic or large trees to make way for new homes or apartments -- like happened twice in Southeast Portland in late September -- this protest was about what some people perceive as the wholesale death and destruction of old Portland.\nÂ» Portland home demolitions: Where do they happen?\nAccording to its website, the group Stop Demolishing Portland seeks to preserve Portland's \"affordable, historic and vintage housing stock\" by petition, by talking with developer and by demonstrations.\nThe 26-year-old man's protest drew a large crowd to the already busy Hawthorne Boulevard street scene. Three men were arrested for supporting the man's protest.\nRobert L. West, 50, Scotty L. Atkins, 45, and Pedro Sanchez Jr., 53, were all booked into the Justice Center Jail on accusations of second-degree disorderly conduct. Atkins and Sanchez were also accused of interfering with a police officer. Sanchez also had an outstanding warrant for an unrelated incident.\nA fourth man -- 36-year-old Brad Mathew Whisler -- was arrested Thursday on accusations of first-degree criminal mischief for allegedly damaging a police car with a key, police said.\nThe unidentified house-sitter rappelled down from the roof at about 9:30 p.m. Thursday. The property owner decided not to press charges against him, police said.\nAt first light Friday -- as security guards kept watch and removed fencing erected Thursday -- workers began knocking down the house at the rear with a small tracked excavator.\nAs the machine's bucket and claws chomped away, pulling away shredded carpet, lathe and plaster and water pipes, workers gathered salvageable metal and piled it in the home's small backyard.\nJust over the fence to the north, neighbor Andrea Strauss said other than some late night screaming emanating from the house during the summer, she was unaware that squatters had been living there.\nShe was also unaware that a young man from Brazil was found dead in the home during the hot summer months. At the request of the man's family, the Multnomah County Medical Examiner's Office will not release the man's name or cause of death. No foul play was involved, police said.\n\"I think it's really sad they're tearing it down,\" Strauss said. \"It's a bad choice. I think it's terrible that they would tear down a historical building for a brand new apartment up; it's very out-of-character for Hawthorne.\"\nStrauss said that adding many more people to the neighborhood is going to also make parking harder, and that \"it's already tough to park on our street.\"\nOn Thursday, another neighbor, Andrew Waltz, said he posted a photograph of the house sitter on Facebook at about 12:30 p.m., shortly after the man climbed up. He said the city appeared to be too lax in allowing developers to tear down homes, but was not sad to see the squatters go.\n\"These are out-of-towners who care very little about the integrity of the neighborhood,\" said Waltz, 31. \"They just want to keep their squat spot.\"\n-- Stuart Tomlinson\nstomlinson@oregonian.com\n503-221-8313\n@ORweather", "external_links": ["http://www.stopdemolishingportland.org/", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2795.888338116696!2d-122.63121588444103!3d45.512326379101545!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x5495a091f66bd5ef%3A0xbd43902ead1346ca!2s3423+SE+Hawthorne+Blvd%2C+Portland%2C+OR+97214!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1445021046028", "https://twitter.com/ORweather"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:38:55.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
