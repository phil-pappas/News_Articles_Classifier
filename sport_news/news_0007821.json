Tonight, the Reds hope to party like they never have before. After a relentless performance Saturday, Eaton is back in the Class 3A Softball Championships semifinals for the first time since 1999. The Reds hope to bring home their first state championship in program history today at the Aurora Sports Park. Seventh-seeded Eaton punched its ticket to the final four for the first time since 1999 with a pair of dramatic come-from-behind wins: 14-12 against No. 10 Cedaredge in the first round, and 8-4 in the quarterfinals over last-year’s state champion, second-seeded La Junta. “Before the game, we wrote ‘1999’ on our wrists, because we knew we had the chance to make history,” said Reds outfielder Taylor Renaud, one of seven seniors on the team. “All the stars were aligning perfectly. We’re just so excited.” Eaton will face No. 3 Sterling (16-5) in the semifinals at 10 a.m., with the winner moving on to the championship against No. 1 Strasburg (21-0) or No. 5 Brush (16-7) at 1:15 p.m. Renaud shined at the plate in the pair of gritty wins Saturday. Her Reds teammates followed suit, as they have all season, producing 25 hits in the two games. However, with a berth in the semifinals at stake, Eaton’s pitching and defense polished off the highly touted Tigers (15-4-1). The Reds held La Junta scoreless in the final five innings after the Tigers took a 4-1 lead with two runs in the second. Eaton junior pitcher Rachel Graham clinched the win with a strikeout and groundout, leaving a pair of runners stranded in the bottom of the seventh. “It was just a good feeling going against the last batter and going into the last out,” Graham said. “Emotions were running high. I trusted my teammates behind me.” Comeback Kids The Reds came back from big deficits in both games. They trailed 12-6 going into the bottom of the fourth in the first round against Cedaredge (13-9). The trailed La Junta 4-2 until scoring three runs in the fifth. Fourth time’s a charm Today’s semifinals game will be the fourth time this season Eaton has matched up with Sterling. The Reds have lost each of the previous three meetings. Eaton lost 16-5 and 10-9 in Patriot League play before losing to the Tigers 18-3 in the Region 3 title game on Oct. 17 in Sterling. “We just need to get back to the way we were playing earlier in the year when we had that good game against them, 10-9 (on Oct. 3),” Reds coach Dale Hughes said. “We’ll go back and we’ll review that game. There were some situations late in that game in which we had opportunities to make a play. ... We believe that we can stay with them.” The last time Eaton advanced to the final four, it lost 5-1 to Erie in the semifinals. Unable to hold on After graduating crucial seniors last school year, Valley came into the season a bit of an underdog to continue its near-decade streak of qualifying for the state tournament. And, the Vikings may have also been an underdog to advance past the first round Saturday, despite being the higher seed. Still, Valley defied expectations by getting to state and almost defied expectations again, falling just short of advancing to Saturday afternoon’s quarterfinals. Ninth-seeded The Academy rallied in the final two innings to top No. 8 Valley, 5-3, in the opening round. The Vikings capped their surprising season with a 12-10 record. “It was definitely an accomplishment,” Valley coach Kevin Miles said of his team’s trip back to state. “The kids put forth the dedication and the effort kids. As the season kept going, they kept believing. And, I thought we had this (first-round game)” Valley led 3-0 before the Wildcats (19-4) scored three runs in the top of the sixth and two more in the seventh. “They played well enough to win but just couldn’t close it out,” Miles said. Running into a buzzsaw Silver Creek scored four runs in the top of the first and never let up in its 14-6 win against Windsor in the first round of the 4A tournament. The 10th-seeded Raptors ultimately out-hit the seventh-seeded Wizards 14-9. “Silver Creek came out ready to hit,” Windsor coach Aryn Henneke said. “Our team fought like we expected them to fight. We battled the composure (issues) all year long, for sure. But, they fought.” The Wizards wrap up their season with a 13-9 record, playing some of their best softball in the final few weeks to return to the state tournament for the second year in a row. Henneke hopes these two years mark the beginning of Windsor once again being a year-to-year state tournament participant. “For a lot of teams who play year to year, state is the goal,” Henneke said. “For some programs, state is the expectation. And, that’s what we’re trying to build.” First round CHS 040 350 0 — 12 12 5 EHS 201 353 X — 14 13 2 EHS — Lauren Frink (4H, 1ER, 3BB, 0SO), Rachel Graham (4th, W, 9-5, 8H, 6ER, 1BB, 2SO) and Karissa Hatchell.
