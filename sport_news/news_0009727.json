Ament.\nBack in August, commissioners told representatives of both counties to make a stronger case for including the DIA and the Anschutz Medical Campus or redraw their proposed enterprise zone boundaries.\nDenver's revised map removed the airport terminal, hotel and concourses but still included undeveloped land to the east and south.\nThe city has lost at least 5,000 jobs and $400 million in investment from projects that considered DIA but ended up locating near airports in other states, said Jeff Romine, chief economist with the Denver Office of Economic Development.\n\"We didn't have infrastructure and incentives in place,\" he said when asked why Denver lost out.\nDevelopment pays for new infrastructure, but without new infrastructure, businesses shy away. That's where incentives can help, Romine said.\nDIA, stuck in that loop for the past two decades, was hoping to break out after landing Panasonic Enterprise Solutions late last year, hammering out a revenue-sharing agreement with Adams County and by obtaining enterprise zone status.\nAdvertisement Businesses in an enterprise zone can claim a 3 percent credit on equipment purchased, as well as credits for job training, new hires, and research and development.\nBut only 1,000 people lived on the airport environs that were being added to the zone, and there isn't a way to ensure the jobs created would employ workers from nearby distressed areas.\nThursday's decision could shift the dynamic between Adams and Denver counties by making development more attractive just outside of DIA's boundaries.\nVoters in both counties will vote on a new agreement next month to share tax revenues from on-airport development.\nAlthough Denver lost the most, Adams County didn't get a free pass.\nAdams County stripped out huge parcels to the north and east of the airport in its revised map. After questioning, the county was allowed to retain the Anschutz Medical Campus but lost Gaylord, which is under construction northeast of the 6400 block of Himalaya Road just south of DIA.\nGiven the project is slated to receive $81.4 million in state Regional Tourism Act incentives, commissioners didn't want to layer on another tax benefit worth millions more.\n\"This is like Christmas for Gaylord,\" said Chairman Dick Monfort.\nAurora Economic Development Council CEO Wendy Mitchell said the exclusion won't alter the project's finances.\n\"We weren't counting on Gaylord being included,\" she said, \"and the developers weren't aware of it.\"\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or @aldosvaldi", "external_links": ["http://www.advancecolorado.com/sites/default/files/Colorado%20Enterprise%20Zone%20Fact%20Sheet%2007.28.15_0.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-15T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:04:28.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
