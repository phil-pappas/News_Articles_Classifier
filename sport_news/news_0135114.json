(AP) -- Justin Thompson kicked four field goals, the Kennesaw State defense allowed just 200 total yards and the Owls beat Gardner-Webb 12-7 on Saturday in their first ever Big South Conference game. \nAfter the teams combined to go three-and-out on the first three possessions of the game, Thompson capped an 11-play, 42-yard drive with a 30-yard field goal. He added a 33-yarder with nine seconds left in the half to give Kennesaw State (5-1, 1-0) a 6-0 lead at the break. \nGardner-Webb (2-4, 1-1) had just 40 total yards in the first half. \nA 19-play, 83-yard drive stalled at the 9 and Kennesaw State settled for a 26-yard field goal and a 9-0 advantage with 13:47 to play. \nJosh Bettistea's 1-yard touchdown run cut Gardner-Webb's deficit to two with 3:43 remaining, but a 31-yard field goal by Thompson - and Nick Perrotta's interception of a Tyrell Maxwell pass on the Bulldogs' next possession - sealed it for the Owls. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
