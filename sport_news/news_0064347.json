I’m anticipating a lot of what we’ve seen the last couple of months.”\nArrieta, one of the top Cy Young contenders this year, admitted on his side day after the Cardinals start that the adrenaline high and energy drain of the day leading up to that start may have contributed to the command issues.\n“Early in the day, you’re trying to conserve energy, but almost anytime you start to think about the game – your approach, the way you’re going to attack that lineup – you’re starting to expend some energy,” Arrieta said. “And I would catch myself — heart rate starting to go up – even when I was just kind of hanging out. Those are things you learn how to control.”\nThat’s what he said he learned going through that Cardinals game, even more than his wild-card four-hitter against the Pirates, and he’ll try to remedy that by starting those thought process and prep work closer to game time.\nMeanwhile, the elephant in the room anytime Arrieta doesn’t look overpowering at the rest of the way is going to be a season workload that has exceeded his previous career high by 67 innings.\nArrieta said physically he’s fine.\nBut his manager admitted that the innings count crossed his mind at times during the Cardinals start, in which Arrieta was lifted in the sixth.\nHe has thrown 243 2/3 innings this season with as many as four starts left, including a potential Game 6 in this series.\n“That game [Monday] pretty much taught me to just watch him,” Maddon said. “Don’t go in with any kind of preconceived thoughts. Just watch him and then try to react accordingly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:28:20.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
