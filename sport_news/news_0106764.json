The Senators wanted to give him three good days of skating with the club before putting him back in the net.\nYes, it's been awhile but Hammond is excited to return and admitted that given the fact it's his first start of the season he'll likely be a little nervous.\n\"I guess I'm understanding of the circumstances and I'm probably going to be a little more anxious than I would for a normal start,\" Hammond said following a one-hour skate at the Bell Sensplex Wednesday.\n\"There's a way that you can control (those nerves) and it's not something I'm too worried about. I'm just excited to get the first one out of the way.\"\nHammond has been gone with an injury but he certainly hasn't been forgotten by anybody in the city. His remarkable 20-1-2 record along with a 1.79 GAA down the stretch after taking over for the injured Robin Lehner and Anderson helped lead the club back to the playoffs on the final day of the season.\nSigned to a three-year, $4.05 million contract in May, the Senators didn't bring Hammond back to challenge for the No. 1 job but they do believe he can be a solid backup given what he accomplished last year. The Senators wouldn't be putting him in the net if they didn't think he was ready to go.\nWith three solid days of practice under their belts after a 4-3 shootout loss to the Nashville Predators last Saturday, coach Dave Cameron and the staff feel the time is right to give Hammond his first big test.\n\"He had a good week of practice and I think he's ready. It's a good time for him to jump into the action,\" said Ottawa assistant Andre Tourigny. \"He's more than ready, he's excited about it. He'll be good.\"\nThe Senators don't seem concerned about the fact Hammond hasn't played since he saw action in Winnipeg in the pre-season on Sept. 29. Tourigny said the coaching staff was looking for a point in the schedule where Hammond would have a chance to have good skates before returning to the net.\nThis break fits well for the timing they wanted.\n\"It is a challenge but the NHL is the best league in the world and whatever the timing it's always a good challenge,\" added Tourigny. \"Andrew has proved what he can do (in this) league and I'm sure he'll be ready.\n\"Mentally he's in the right place and I have no doubts about him ... He had three really good practices and he's feeling good so I have no issue about him jumping into the season (Thursday). It's good timing for him.\"\nIt's not like Hammond hasn't been through long stretches without playing before and, in fact, it happened last season. He was called up on Jan. 29 when Anderson suffered a deep bone bruise but didn't see action until Lehner was injured on Feb. 16 against the Carolina Hurricanes.\nFrom that point, the Senators couldn't get him out of the net.\n\"You learn that good habits in practice will translate into the game,\" said Hammond. \"That's been my focus since training camp started and that's making sure I'm getting the most out of each practice.\n\"Coming back from injury, it's even more important. It's kind of been the case the last week that I've had really good practices.\"\nOne guy who won't be ready is defenceman Marc Methot. He returned to skate with his teammates after suffering a concussion last week but was used as an extra. That means Chris Wideman will remain in the lineup.\n\"It's day-to-day. It was good to see (Methot) back on the ice with his teammates but he's not ready to go,\" said Tourigny.\nThe Hamburglar is and that's good news for the Senators.\nTwitter: @ sungarrioch\nGarrioch\nCan Senators' Andrew Hammond return to miracle play?
