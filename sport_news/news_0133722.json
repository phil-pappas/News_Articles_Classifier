I am sure that he will be able to pick up his form again once he returns.\" \nThe setback means Gotze will miss both of his club's Champions League matches against Arsenal. \nMeanwhile, Manchester United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger looks likely to be unavailable for the Georgia game as well due to what is reported to be a thigh injury. \nThe 31-year-old sat out the Ireland match, with a message on the German team's official Twitter account saying: \"@BSchweinsteiger picked up an injury during the pre-match warm-up and will miss the game.\" \nAnd Low said afterwards with a view to the Georgia clash: ''For Bastian Schweinsteiger we'll have to wait and see. The chances are slim though. \n\"The medical staff said two or three days' rest.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:59:38.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
