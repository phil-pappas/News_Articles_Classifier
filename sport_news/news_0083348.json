CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY JOHN CUMMINGS By John Cummings Contributing Writer BLUE ASH — \nThe Edgewood High School volleyball team swept Hamilton in the first round of the Division I sectional tournament Monday night. \nEHS (7-15) had trouble shaking Big Blue (4-18) in the first and third games but scored a 25-20, 25-12, 25-20 win. \nIn the first game, the two teams battled through five ties and seven lead changes before the Cougars used a four-point run — two HHS hitting errors, a kill by Ally Williams and an ace by Madison Asher — to take control. \n“We always seem to have first game jitters,” EHS coach Jill Richter said. “We just had to play our game and get focused and ready to roll.” \nHamilton got as close as 16-14 on a block by Dede Rodriguez and Savannah Conrad, but could not get any closer, dropping the first game on a net serve. \n“In the beginning, we were a little slow,” said Asher, who finished with 15 kills and six blocks. “We just got more calm and started to play together. Once we played together more, it made us more confident.” \nEdgewood jumped to a 9-0 lead in game two on the serving of Williams and built a 23-9 lead. \n“The second game, we didn’t have nearly as much heart and passion on the floor as we did the first game,” Hamilton coach Madison Dodd said. “We are going to face adversity and winners build off it. We had six girls who this was their last time playing for the school and I asked them if they wanted their legacy to be what they did in the second game and it brought more out of them.” \nBig Blue responded with a quick 2-1 lead in the third game, but Asher and Williams took over at the net, to give Edgewood a 7-3 lead. \nHamilton tied the game three times, the last at 10-10, but hitting errors helped Edgewood build the lead to 20-13 before Hamilton made a mini-run to trim it to 22-20 on a kill by Emilie Sauerwein. \nAsher got Edgewood to game point on a kill and Ryanne Kotte closed it out with an ace. \n“You always get a little nervous at the end,” Asher said. “But when we come together as a team, we work better and communicate better and come out with it.” \nEdgewood will face No. 2 Mount Notre Dame at 6 p.m. Wednesday at Ursuline. \nFairfield battles through : For the second time in a week, Fairfield had to look across the net at Princeton. \nAfter cruising to a three-set win in the Greater Miami Conference match Oct. 13, the Indians had to battle a little bit to take a 3-0 (25-10, 26-24, 25-22) triumph in the nightcap. \nAfter taking a 16-0 lead in the first game, Fairfield had to battle back from a 14-1 deficit to win game two. The Indians trailed again in game three, 22-19, but ran off the final six points to secure the win. \nFairfield will face No. 16 Kings on 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Ursuline.
