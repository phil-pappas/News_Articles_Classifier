I’m a little faster and bigger now so that makes it easier for me to run better.”Tidwell isn’t just running past opponents but running through them as well.“I’m not really much of a juker,” Tidwell said. “I don’t have those moves but I will hit you in the mouth. I have some speed and once I hit you I’m going to keep going. My running back coach gets on me because I hit too many people. He tells me I need to start putting some moves on people or use the stiff arm.”Tidwell has also been effective on special teams this year, returning two kicks for TDs, and in the passing game, catching two passes for scores.This Friday, Tidwell will likely continue to add to his rushing totals against Region 5-A rival Eagle’s Landing Christian at Commitment Field in McDonough. The Chargers have won the last three meetings and lead the all-time series 7-5.“We all want to put it to them,” Tidwell said. “The next three games are very important. We just have to give it our all and if we do everything we are supposed to do we will be good.”Tidwell also wants to help Landmark get back to the Georgia Dome for the first time since 2011.“I didn’t come into the season with any personal goals but just to help the team get to the state championship and help win that,” Tidwell said. “I think it will be a big journey to get there but I think we can do it.”McGuire, who is a senior, will have a critical role in that goal as well.“He is a really smart player and can see the field really well--how the defense is lining up,” Tidwell said. “It helps me out a lot to see where the hole is for me.”After the football season has ended, Tidwell plans to join the baseball team once again. As far as playing football in college, Tidwell said Purdue and Columbia have been in contact.
