The second quarter, however, is where things started to get wild. \nOn the first play of the second quarter, Dom Samson connected to Ivoree Atkinson on a 78-yard touchdown to give Panther Creek a 14-7 lead. \nApex pulled even on an an Ian Boyd fumble that was recovered by teammate Julien Tate-Banks in the endzone for a touchdown, but Panther Creek's J Johnson returned the ensuing kickoff to go back up 20-14. \nNot to be held down long, Apex regained the lead less than a minute later, 21-20, on a 60-yard score. \nStill in the second quarter, Panther Creek (4-6, 2-4 Southwest Wake) again pulled ahead, 26-21, on a TD run by Toney Bass. And for good measure, Apex reclaimed the lead as time expired on a Boys touchdown. \nThe second half was equally as crazy as the firs. On the first play of the second half, Panther Creek found the endzone from 42 yards out and took a 32028 advantage. \nLater in the third, Apex went in front on an Isaiah Totten touchdown, just to fall back behind, 38-35, on a Samson TD pass. \nPanther Creek was able to take the game's first two-score lead late in the third quarter on Samson's fourth touchdown pass, 44-35. \nBut Apex (4-5, 3-3 Southwest Wake) battled back. Another fumble in the endzone was pounced on by the Cougars and the score was 44-41. That was followed by another Totten score to put Apex in front 48-44. \nApex claimed their first two score lead of the night, 55-44, on a 77-yard touchdwon by Totten -- his third of the night. \nPanther Creek cut the lead to 55-52 with six minutes to play, but couldn't get any closer. \nPanther Creek will close out their regular season next week against Fuquay-Varina. Apex will have a bye next week before wrapping up their regular season at Middle Creek Nov. 6. \nCopyright 2015 by Capitol Broadcasting Company. All rights reserved.
