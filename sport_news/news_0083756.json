Umberger is feeling good after missing two games with an upper-body injury. With an assist in each game, Umberger was the Flyers' leading scorer when he exited the lineup. He took a full practice Sunday and Monday and says he feels well enough to return. The problem is: if Umberger returns, who comes out? \nQuestions about a healthy lineup were asked when we opened up the #FlyersMailbag , a sporadic segment we do using Twitter questions. @davegisaac if Umberger plays on Tuesday, where does he play? #FlyersMailbag — Matt King (@mittkang) October 19, 2015 \nI'm not convinced that he does. Umberger had two points in two games, but so did Sam Gagner in Umberger's absence. It looks as though Gagner will remain in the lineup on a line with Brayden Schenn and Scott Laughton, but things could change. Umberger took reps with that same line, but the constant was that Gagner was in every rep in each drill, so it looks like he's staying in the lineup. — Dan The Flyera Fan (@DanTheFlyeraFan) October 19, 2015 \nNah. \nMichal Neuvirth has a shutout streak of 132:05, but this is still Steve Mason's team. As of Monday's practice, my guess is that Mason ends up getting the start. Having a five-day break is enough downtime for Neuvirth to cool off and it probably doesn't send the best message to Mason if now that he's returned to the team he has to sit and wait to get a start back. Neuvirth came to the Flyers knowing he was second fiddle. He can keep the confidence of that shutout streak and play Wednesday on the second half of the Flyers' back-to-back. @davegisaac Lecavalier, MacDonald & Luke Schenn: Who gets moved first? Any early suitors/teams you think would be a good fit? #FlyersMailbag — Nick LaRosa (@nlarosa62) October 19, 2015 \nI don't think it's super likely that any of them get moved. Schenn would appear the easiest to move just because he doesn't have term left on his contract. No one in the league is interested in Lecavalier's diminished game and no one is interested in MacDonald at $5 million per year. There have been rumors about the Flyers and Winnipeg Jets — GM Kevin Cheveldayoff was at Wells Fargo Center with two top scouts last Wednesday — but the Jets aren't in need of right-handed defensemen. @davegisaac #FlyersMailbag do you see Brayden breaking out on that Top 6 LW — Evgeny Medvedev (@EMedvedev82) October 19, 2015 \nHe's been on the second line at times with Sean Couturier and Wayne Simmonds, but at the moment he's on Laughton's line on the right side. With the Flyers, that's always a fluid situation, but I don't see him going any higher than that second line spot, barring injury. Michael Raffl pretty much has that top-line left wing slot secured. @davegisaac in your opinion, how has Gudas played so far? #FlyersMailbag — S (@SandisMinnesota) October 19, 2015 \nI think he's been fine. At times he'll go out of his way to hit an opponent and take himself out of position, but he's done a decent job of getting back in position and has done very well blocking shots. He's not a flashy defenseman like Evgeny Medvedev can be at times, but he's quietly done a pretty good job. @davegisaac I'll play nice. What are the key differencse you see so far between Berube's and Hakstol's coaching styles. #FlyersMailbag . — PhillyGirl1437 (@PhillyGirl1437) October 19, 2015 \nThe biggest difference so far is the play in the neutral zone on both sides. The Flyers are defending it well and are doing a better job of not turning it over in the neutral zone. In terms of defending, the biggest difference is that a winger goes to the weak side instead of spreading both defensemen out wide and leaving a hole up the middle of the ice for the opponent to penetrate. @davegisaac If the Flyers suffer an injury on D, whom do they call up? Does Ghost get a shot or do they bring back AMac? #FlyersMailbag — Marcello C. De Feo (@marcellodefeo) October 19, 2015 \nIf there's an injury, I believe MacDonald gets the first call. The Flyers would need $280,000 in cap space to recall McDonald and $255,000 in order to recall Gostisbehere, but GM Ron Hextall really feels he owes it to MacDonald to give him the first call-up on defense because he is more established in the NHL and Gostisbehere could still use some seasoning in the minors. In three games so far this season, Gostisbehere has one assist. Don't miss a thing \nDownload our apps and get alerts for local news, crime, weather, traffic and more.
