General managers were not allowed to vote for their own players so Smart has a fan in the front office of an opposing team. “What’s breakout mean?” Celtics coach Brad Stevens asked before the Celtics played the Knicks Thursday night in a preseason game at the Garden. Good question. In 67 regular-season games last season as a rookie, Smart averaged 7.8 points, 3.3 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.5 steals while shooting only 36.7 percent overall and 33.5 percent from 3-point range. If he improved those numbers to, say, 12 or 13 points, 5 or 6 rebounds and assists and shot 42 percent overall and 38 percent from beyond the arc, would that qualify as a breakout season? Maybe not, but the Celtics would likely settle for that. “My biggest thing about Marcus,” Stevens said, “is not what he does statistically, it’s how he impacts winning. Sometimes those two things go hand in hand, sometimes they don’t with what he does. I don’t know if he’ll have a ‘breakout year’ from a perception standpoint, but I know that guy impacts winning and so he’ll play a big role for us.” For Smart to have a breakout season, he believes he must get to the rim more often than he did last season. “That’s just going to open me up,” said the sixth pick of the 2014 NBA Draft out of Oklahoma State, “to knock down open 3s that I know that I’m capable of. I have to just learn and put pressure on the defense.” Smart said a sprained left ankle he suffered in his fifth NBA game bothered him for much of his rookie season and prevented him from driving to the basket. “It was hard to explode off it,” he said. “I was a little hesitant and kind of babied it a little bit, but now that the ankle’s better I can explode and do more. I can kind of force the issue on the offensive end.” Of course, Smart’s forte is defense. He uses his 6-foot-4, 220-pound frame to overpower many opposing point guards. David Lee, acquired from Golden State in the offseason, has been impressed with his new teammate. “He’s one intense guy defensively,” Lee said, “takes on the challenge, and offensively shoots the ball better than I thought he did and can really get into the paint and make plays. He’s a better passer than I thought he was, too. In college I saw him play more and saw him more as an off-guard type of guy, but as a point he’s proven a lot to me.” Page 2 of 2 - Many ranked Smart as the best player in the Utah Jazz Summer League last July, but he dislocated two fingers on his right hand halfway through summer league play. Smart said the fingers feel fine now and he’s finally feeling 100 percent after missing two preseason games with strep throat. Preseason numbers don’t mean much, but Smart entered Thursday averaging 9 points, 4 assists and 2.7 rebounds while shooting 47.1 percent overall and 28.6 percent from 3-point range. Smart, 21, didn’t become a regular starter last season until February, but he’ll start at the point to open this season. “I’m more comfortable,” he said. “The game has slowed up for me a little bit more. It’s not as fast. I know what to expect a little bit more than I did last year.” The numbers say that Smart needs to improve his shooting, but Stevens is more concerned about other parts of his game. “I think the biggest thing is,” Stevens said, “he’s going to continue to have the ball and just making the right plays in every right moment. It’s a lot easier to talk about than to do. He’s a big-time competitor, so he’s got that killer instinct to take and make big shots. And being able to discern when that time is will continue to be something that he is working on.” By BILL DOYLE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:37:39.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
