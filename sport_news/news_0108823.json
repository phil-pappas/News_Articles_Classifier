The Owls were game at times but fell 33-17 to Marshall on Saturday at FAU Stadium. FAU is now 1-5 overall and 1-2 in Conference USA.\n\"Our credit goes to them,\" FAU coach Charlie Partridge said. \"It didn't go the way we wanted to go. There's a lot of progress. â€¦ Our kids fought the entire game. I'm disappointed in the result, there's no question.\"\nThe Owls kept things close for three quarters despite playing without starting quarterback Jaquez Johnson, who was ruled out shortly before the game because of a sore ankle. Still, backup Jason Driskel had FAU in contention of making things interesting.\nAfter getting most of the first-team reps in practice, Driskel learned he would start late Friday night. Johnson's playing status will be further evaluated next week.\n\"[My performance] wasn't good enough and I came here to win,\" said Driskel, who completed 14-of-31 passes for 203 yards with no touchdowns and an interception. \"I need to play better to give us a better shot to win.\"\nTrailing 30-17, the Owls were driving until Driskel's fourth-down pass was tipped and intercepted by Marshall defensive back Corey Tindal. The Thundering Herd then put it away on a 33-yard field goal by Nick Smith that made it a 16-point game with 9 minutes 46, seconds left.\nAnother opportunity lost.\n\"The one interception at the end, it's fourth-and-whatever and trying to make something happen,\" Partridge said. \"I think he protected the ball well. He was working to manage the game. He had some good shots. He looked young but he's getting great, valuable learning experience. He'll get better as we go along.\"\nThe Owls were playing from behind throughout, with Marshall needing just two plays for running back Devon Johnson to break a 75-yard touchdown on the opening drive. After an FAU field goal, the Owls lost momentum for good when they were pinned at their 2-yardline on a punt.\nThe staff decided to play it safe by running three straight downs, mainly because of Driskel's lack of experience. On the last attempt, running back Jay Warren was tackled for a safety. Marshall then needed just four plays on its next drive to take control, capping it with a 1-yard run from Remi Watson to make it 16-3 with 14:55 left in the first half.\nFAU allowed 500 total yards, including 326 on the ground. It was similar to last year when the Thundering Herd rolled up 328 rushing yards against the Owls.\nThe lone defensive bright spot was safety Ocie Rose keeping FAU in the game when things were about to get out of hand. Marshall was in the red zone threatening to increase the lead until Rose stepped in front of quarterback Chase Litton's pass near the goal line and returned it a school-record 95 yards for a touchdown.\n\"I knew he was going to take it inside and run back out,\" Rose said. \"I just had to keep inside leverage on him. I jumped in front of him and just started running.\"\nAs has been the case all season, the Owls have rarely been able to string successive offense and defensive series. The celebration of Rose's play was short-lived as Marshall needed just six plays for Litton to connect with Davonte Allen on a 22-yard touchdown pass.\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n Florida Atlantic Owls Marshall Thundering Herd Conference USA", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5622a45a/turbine/fl-florida-atlantic-marshall-1018-20151017"], "published": "2015-10-17T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:44:52.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
