We'll get there, it's going to be a lot of hard work but we'll get there in the finish.\" \nVilla are four points adrift of the safety line ahead of their game at Stamford Bridge while Chelsea are 16th having won just twice in their opening eight games. \nBlues boss Jose Mourinho is also under pressure and Wilkins, a former Chelsea player and assistant manager, believes Villa could catch the defending champions cold. \n\"It's very unusual to see Chelsea in this condition and we're going to go there with a positive mindset and try to get the best result we can,\" Wilkins told talkSPORT \n\"We're under no illusions, it's going to be extremely tough for us \n\"But Chelsea are going through a bit of a difficult time at the moment, so it's a good time for us to meet them.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:06:41.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
