According to Rappeport, Trump said the Redskins name debate was another example of unnecessary political correctness. “I know Indians that are extremely proud of that name,” Trump said. “They think it’s a positive.” \nLast week, Bush was asked whether the Redskins should change their name during an interview with Sirius XM’s POTUS Channel. \n“I don’t think they should change it,” he said. “I don’t think politicians ought to be having any say about that, to be honest with you. I don’t find it offensive. Native American tribes generally don’t find it offensive.” The Change the Mascot Campaign issued a statement in response to Trump’s remarks: \n“It is hardly surprising that a candidate who labeled Mexican immigrants rapists and calls women ‘pigs’ now says he wants the NFL to continue slurring Native Americans. Donald Trump joins some of the NFL’s ignoble fraternity of billionaires who sit in their office suites and owners boxes happily spending their fortunes denigrating people of color.” Scott Allen writes about all things D.C. sports.
