That is the only time the event has been staged outside England or Scotland.\nCalls for Northern Ireland to stage the British Open increased after McIlroy and fellow countrymen Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke won major tournaments in the past five years.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:01:39.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
