Todd Peat, who played nine seasons in the NFL, has done what he can to help his 21-year-old son transition from college to the pros while also learning to play an offensive line position new to him.\n\"He's kind of given me advice after each game,\" Peat said. \"It's always the same: to always be ready.\"\nMore advice will come this weekend if Peat is asked to play the most snaps of his four-game NFL career.\nA knee injury to Terron Armstead caused him to miss practice Wednesday and Thursday, and Peat could need to fill in for the left tackle if he is declared out for the road game Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nPeat said he felt most comfortable at left tackle because he played the position while in high school and in college at Stanford. But with the 24-year-old Armstead entrenched at that position, the Saints moved Peat to the other side of the line to right tackle as a backup to 11th-year veteran Zach Strief . Peat also comes in as an extra blocker in the Saints' \"jumbo\" formations and in short-yardage situations.\n\"I think the snaps he has handled in the jumbo packages, which have expanded a little bit, he has done a good job with,\" Saints coach Sean Payton said. \"We get to see the day-to-day practice and we get to see him block some of our better rushers. He's in good shape. I would say, early on, it has been real good.\"\nPeat was on the field as an extra blocker for two touchdowns in the Saints' 26-20 overtime win Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys. Peat also helped seal off Cowboys linebacker Anthony Hitchens on a pair of runs by Mark Ingram for 9 and 8 yards to set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Khiry Robinson in the fourth quarter.\n\"It's pretty fun to block like that,\" Peat said.\nPeat's snap count has increased from three to five to seven to 14 over the four games this season. Peat played five of his 14 snaps Sunday at his familiar position of left tackle in place of Armstead when he briefly went to the locker room for athletic trainers to check his ankle.\n\"I thought I did well when I was in there,\" Peat said. \"It was good that Terron got to go back in there. I was just staying ready all the time.\"\nPeat said the main adjustment to playing on the other side of the line is everything is flipped around -- with his right hand on the turf instead of his left, and his slide step going to the right instead of the left when pass blocking.\n\"Just getting used to getting in the left-handed stance, transitioning, pushing off your left foot,\" Peat said. \"I'm starting to get more comfortable at both now,\" he added. \"I'm ready to play both sides.\"\nPeat said his father, a former offensive lineman who played nine seasons with the St. Louis/Phoenix Cardinals and Los Angeles Raiders, has watched video of his son's eight preseason and regular season games. Included in that is the preseason finale in which Peat played all 62 snaps at right tackle against the Green Bay Packers.\n\"I'd probably say, just early on -- struggling a little bit especially with conditioning and the speed of the game -- he said just (to) keep working hard, stay steady and not get too down on myself,\" Peat said.\nAdded Peat: \"I can pretty much tell him anything I'm frustrated with or anything that's going on. I'll bounce it off him and he'll give me his ideas. It's really helped me to kind of not get too high or too low.\"\nAs for this Sunday, Peat said he planned to stay ready for whatever came his way.\n\"That's what I've been doing all season,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:58:50.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
