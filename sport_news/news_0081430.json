The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the school has not announced Spurrier's decision to retire or who will be the interim coach.\nMore answers could come about the sudden developments when Spurrier holds his weekly news conference — which has been moved to a more spacious location on campus — Tuesday at noon EDT.\n  Spurrier told his team on Monday night that he was retiring, effective immediately, the person told the AP.\nThe Gamecocks are 2-4 and 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference for the first time in Spurrier's 23 seasons coaching in the league at Florida and South Carolina.\nSpurrier, in the middle of his 11th season at South Carolina, did not return messages seeking comment.\nSouth Carolina freshman offensive lineman Christian Pellage said on Twitter, \"What a crazy day... I am blessed to say I was coached by a legend. Best of luck to you Coach Spurrier. Stay cocky!\"\nSpurrier considered leaving last December after the Gamecocks went 6-6 in the regular season. But the team beat Miami in the Independence Bowl, a victory that seemed to re-energize him.\nHe said this summer he planned to coach two or three more years, then extended that to four or five years when several recruits who had committed to South Carolina backed away before signing day in February.\nThen in July, Spurrier held a defiant news conference, telling Gamecocks fans not to listen to \"enemies\" questioning his commitment level, or implying he could no longer effectively coach at his age.\n\"We haven't lost it,\" Spurrier said in the summer. \"We've got a dang, good team.\"\nBut things have quickly spiraled downward this season.\nThe Gamecocks lost to Kentucky at home in the season's second week, then were blown out by SEC Eastern Division rival Georgia, 52-20, a week later.\nLosses at Missouri and No. 6 LSU last week guaranteed Spurrier no better than a break-even season. Spurrier had never had a losing season in 25 previous seasons coaching in college at Duke (1987-89), Florida (1990-2001) and South Carolina.\nSouth Carolina's inconsistency on offense this season has surely frustrated Spurrier, a Heisman Trophy winning quarterback at Florida who played for San Francisco and Tampa Bay in the NFL. After beginning his coaching career in the USFL, and leading Duke, he returned to the Swamp and took the Gators to a national championship with a high-flying, Fun-n-Gun attack.\nThe Gamecocks are 11th in total offense in the SEC, averaging 341 yards a game.\nThe high-water mark of Spurrier's 11 seasons at South Carolina was from 2011-13. The Gamecocks went 11-2 each season, led by quarterback Connor Shaw and top NFL draft picks like defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, receiver Alshon Jeffery and running back Marcus Lattimore.\nThe Gamecocks have used three starting quarterbacks through the first half of this season, including former walk-on Perry Orth and true freshman in Lorenzo Nunez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:42:20.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
