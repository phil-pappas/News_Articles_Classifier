A few players headed directly for the tunnel. \nAnd then there was defensive lineman Terrance Knighton, who sprinted and bounced and leaped and hopped and dashed straight toward the home locker room, while waving his arms to the crowd for noise. Observed: It is enjoyable to watch Terrance Knighton sprint and bounce and leap and hop and dash after a victory. Because there is a lot of him to bounce and leap, etc. \nWhy did he skip the usual niceties? \n“It’s a rivalry,” he explained. “I don’t want to shake their hands. We’re going to see them again. And I was just excited. The fans wanted this victory, and 2-2 is a lot better than 1-3, especially in a division where it’s going to come down to the end of the season. This is a big victory, a division game that we needed to win after losing last week. And we just responded how we wanted to.” \nAnd why such haste? \n“I wanted to get off the field as quick as I could, man,” Knighton said. “All these penalties, all these things we had to overcome, [Chris Culliver] out there playing with one leg, guys just fought through it. And I just wanted to get off the field as quick as possible before they threw another flag.” \nA+ answer. Many of Knighton’s teammates, meanwhile, headed to social media to celebrate their upset win.
