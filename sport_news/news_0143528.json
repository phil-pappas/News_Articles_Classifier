Comment MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA By Rich Garven Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 6:30 PM By Rich Garven@RichGarvenTG Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 6:30 PM FOXBORO — Danny Amendola was the Patriots’ de facto replacement for Wes Welker, but after two seasons of modest returns on a hefty investment they asked the wide receiver and punt returner to take a sizable pay cut in March. Amendola was coming off a year in which he caught 27 passes — the lowest total of his career outside of 2011, when he suffered a season-ending elbow injury in Week 1 — but he remained confident in his abilities as a player. And also in his ability to find work outside of New England. However, after careful consideration, Amendola accepted the Patriots’ restructured offer of three years and $14.25 million, only $500,000 of which was guaranteed. In the process, he saw his base salary slashed from $4 million to $1.25 million this season. “Obviously, I know it’s a business,” Amendola said Wednesday, as the undefeated Patriots turned their full attention to Sunday’s AFC East summit meeting with the hated New York Jets. “But I respect playing with these guys. I love the locker room. I love the preparation we put in each week to try to play at our highest level each week. “It was mainly just a personal decision to come back and fulfill some personal goals of mine.” Both parties are clearly pleased thus far with the continuation of their working relationship. The Patriots are 5-0 and Amendola has put up some equally impressive numbers. The seventh-year pro has 17 receptions for 203 yards and a touchdown. His average of 11.9 yards per catch ranks second on the team to All-World tight end Rob Gronkowski (18.5), and his seven catches on third down are tops on the team and tied for 16th in the AFC. In addition, Amendola is averaging 11 yards on 10 punt returns. That ranks eighth in the NFL. “Danny’s been very solid for us all year and really every day, whether it be OTAs, training camp, practice, games,” coach Bill Belichick said. “He’s in great condition. He can run all day. He’s done a good job for us in the return game. He’s done a good job for us offensively. Blocking, he’s really made some great blocks. He’s helped spring some guys for some big runs. He’s done an excellent job on third down. He’s done a really good job as we use different formations. He’s a versatile player, smart, makes very few mistakes. “He’s been a very dependable player for us in really everything we’ve asked him to do and nobody works harder or practices harder than Danny does.” The 5-foot-11, 190-pound Amendola has played 56.5 percent of the offensive snaps this season, up from 41 percent last year. And there have been some sensational singular plays in there. Page 2 of 2 - Amendola had a 28-yard punt return that set up a touchdown and gave the Patriots a lead they wouldn’t relinquish against the Buffalo Bills in Week 2. He had one catch in that same game, but it came in the fourth quarter, was good for 29 yards and led to a Stephen Gostkowski field goal that completed the scoring in the 40-32 win. In Week 5, Amendola returned a punt 25 yards that led to a 3-0 lead against the Dallas Cowboys in a game the Patriots would eventually win in a runaway. Amendola, who has a well-documented injury history, is healthy. That’s played a large role in his increased contributions, and his continued development. “He’s out there every day,” offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said. “He’s working on his craft. He’s improving in a lot of different areas. He’s always been a dependable catcher of the football, and we count on him to do a lot of different things. Certain games, he may play a little bit more than others based on how the game goes, but Danny is always ready to do whatever we need him to do. “And whenever we’ve called Danny’s number, he usually comes up big for us, so we depend on him a lot.” Amendola is coming off, statistically speaking, his most impressive effort of the young season. He was targeted nine times in a win over the Indianapolis Colts last weekend and responded with seven receptions for 105 yards. It was his fourth 100-yard receiving game in 38 games, playoffs included, as a Patriot, and his first since he piled up 131 yards on 10 catches in a loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 15, in 2013. “I’m just trying to work best with the opportunity I get,” Amendola said. “Whatever I can do to help the team win, that’s why I’m here.” That, along with a willingness to accept less money to spend more time in a place he wants to stay.
