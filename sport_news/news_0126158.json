Then DMX. Then Kanye West. Then Metallica. One song followed another, the first noticeable difference for the Gamecocks under interim head coach Shawn Elliott. “It keeps us rolling,” said senior offensive tackle Brandon Shell, a Goose Creek native. “It keeps the tempo rolling, it keeps you moving. When you get tired, that music just keeps you upbeat.” Under Spurrier, who resigned Tuesday, USC often played music during warm-ups, but not throughout practice. In the first session under Elliott, the hits just kept on coming. It was but one sign of how Elliott is trying to energize a team off to its worst start in over a decade, and needs a big push in its final six games to salvage bowl eligibility — not to mention give the interim coach a shot at the full-time job. “I think music plays a huge role. It moves people. And I think we needed a little bit of movement,” Elliott said Wednesday. “I wanted our players to get a little more energetic, take their minds off some things. I thought, what better way to do it than, let’s go out there and get some tunes on, and see everybody kind of light up. You see their feet start popping a little bit, their hands start moving, their heads start moving, and they’re feeling good.” Ask players to describe Elliott, formerly USC’s co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, and one term comes up again and again. “High intensity,” Shell said. He differs from Spurrier not just in age — Elliott is 42, his predecessor 70 — but also temperament, as evidenced by how he would repeatedly jump and slam up against his offensive linemen to help get them fired up prior to games. “He brings such passion to the team,” said senior guard Mike Matulis. “As you see every Saturday — you can see it in his eyes — he’s just as fired up as anyone else.” Elliott was recommended for the role by team captains Matulis, Pharoh Cooper, Skai Moore and Isaiah Johnson, who were summoned to a meeting with athletics director Ray Tanner at around midnight Monday night. Although Spurrier was hesitant to endorse one of his assistants for the interim job, the players were not. “We just kind of voiced our opinions on who we thought would be a good leader,” Matulis said. “Not to knock any of the other coaches, because we have a bunch of great coaches on this coaching staff. But we just felt that coach Elliott brought some fire to the table. A little bit more edge.” That’s something even Spurrier realized his former team needed. “They need to hear a different message. And Shawn’s giving them one,” he said Wednesday in an unprompted call to SiriusXM College Sports Radio. “They did some things different in practice (Tuesday), and we needed to. Our practice habits were not near good enough, and hopefully they can get those changed.” A Camden native, Elliott grew up going to games at Williams-Brice Stadium before attending Appalachian State, where he played defensive end. He coached 12 years with the Mountaineers, winning three Football Championship Subdivision national titles, before arriving at USC (2-4, 0-4 SEC) in 2010. His debut as interim coach comes Saturday, in a 4 p.m. home game against Vanderbilt (2-3, 0-2). Spurrier taught him to be true to himself. “He’s showed me, don’t cave into what everyone wants from you,” Elliott said. Perhaps not coincidentally, players say Elliott has seemed the same in practice, although the change in job title now has him overseeing much more than the offensive line. “He’s running around more than us, I think,” Matulis said. “He’s running from the DBs over here to the O-line over there to the quarterbacks over there to the D-line over here. He’s moving, and it’s exciting to watch.” No surprise, then, that the tempo in practice has picked up. “Very urgent,” Shell called it. That’s not by accident. “A few changes here and there. A few practice changes,” Elliott said. “A different type intensity, I would say, out there on the practice field. They’ve responded well.” Some upbeat cuts from DMX and Guns N’ Roses certainly didn’t hurt. “We were all dancing and jiving. It’s fun,” Matulis said. Indeed, these are not Spurrier-run practices anymore.
