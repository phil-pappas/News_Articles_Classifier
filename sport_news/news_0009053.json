Both sides resorted to stone pelting. The clash even took communal colour with the two factions raising religious slogans. A bank ATM in the market was vandalised and the guard injured as Sikh youths brandishing swords and rods turned violent. Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (ADCP-1) J Elanchezhian, SHO Bimal Kant and a few other policemen were injured in the clash. A police vehicle too got partly damaged. Photojournalists had a narrow escape when armed Sikh protesters chased them for clicking their pictures. Their bikes too were damaged by the angry youths. A squad of Anti-Riot Police (ARP) was called to the spot after Police Commissioner Yurinder Hayre and Deputy Commissioner KK Yadav visited the spot. The duo held long parleys with both sides, to defuse tension. SAD and BJP leaders, including minister Ajit Singh Kohar, former minister Manoranjan Kalia and CPS KD Bhandari too reached the spot to pacify the warring groups. The shopkeepers criticised the MLAs and the police for failing to take action against Sikh activists forcing shutdown. Police Commissioner Yurinder Singh Hayre said, “Some bad elements were spreading tension. We will investigate each and every aspect of the clash and the guilty would be punished.” Adda Hoshiarpur Shopkeepers Association president Deepak Joshi said, “We were not informed by any Sikh organisation about a Punjab bandh call. The police and the state government seem to be favouring the Sikh protesters, who are brandishing swords. This is the festival season, we can’t afford to keep our shops shut.” The matter was resolved in the evening when shops were opened in the presence of police commissioner, MLAs and Cabinet Minister Kohar. The police also held a flag march. Anti-govt drive on social media Chandigarh: People in the state are taking to social media to vent their anger against the SAD-BJP-led state government. Sikh activists have flayed the government for its “shoddy handling” of the sacrilege issue and the farmers’ stir. Social media platforms such as Whatsapp and the Facebook are playing a crucial role in the polity of the state. Photos and videos of anguished protesters, blockades, forced bandhs and even of a policeman beaten up by the crowd for making a video of protesters are being circulated on these sites. — Varinder Singh Intel agencies failed to gauge simmering anger Faridkot: The police and the intelligence agencies have reportedly failed to gauge the simmering anger among the Sikhs over the “bir” stolen from a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village of Faridkot on June 1. The fact that higher authorities were not seized of the matter reflects poorly on the functioning of the police. The theft had triggered many protests. The incident has sparked outrage and has even led to the suspension of Moga SSP Charanjit Sharma for his alleged negligence in informing the higher authorities about the theft. — Balwant Garg Progressive farmer returns award\nChandigarh: A progressive farmer, Daljeet Singh Sadarpura, who was honoured by the with a “Parman Patra” has returned the award to lodge his protest against the desecration of ‘bir’ and the killing of two persons in police firing near Kotkapura last week.He alleged the people were protesting peacefully when the police needlessly fired on them killing two Sikhs on the spot.
