Brandon Leff ran for 233 yards and Logan Holbrook added 217 to push SCHS to an 8-0 record. Spencer County led 34-7 at the half, but Barrett Sanderson threw four touchdowns and pushed a comeback in the second half. SCHS held off the comeback and stayed undefeated. Sanderson threw for 267 yards, but Spencer County’s 479 rushing yards were too much for Franklin County. St. Xavier 27 vs Manual 6 \nFor the 27th straight time, St. X beat Manual. Led by Desmond Ridder, the Tigers never trailed and were the first team to score 20 points against the Crimsons in 2015. Ridder threw for 151 yards and 68 rushing yards as he accounted for all three of St. X’s touchdowns. Held back by 14 penalties, Manual lost for the first time this season. Their defense could not contain Ridder from the opening drive throughout the rest of the game. Ridder has struggled with consistency in his sophomore season, but it is obvious he is coming into his own. It’s scary to think he still has two seasons left to develop. Cooper 27 vs Ryle 21 \nAnother undefeated season came to an end as Ryle fell for the first time to Cooper. Ryle led 3-0 at the half, but Cooper took a 14-6 lead after three quarters. Ryle would tie it at 14 and Cooper would score two late touchdowns to push away the Raiders 27-21. The big play came when Byron Brown of Cooper returned a kick for a touchdown to give the Jaguars a 21-14 lead. Cooper would not look back after that score. Notes From Across the State \nKash killed a guy.
