Comment Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 4:54 PM » RELATED CONTENT • H.S. girls soccer: Central Catholic puts delay behind, rolls past Columbiana... The stakes don’t get much higher for a high school girls soccer game than Monday night’s district semifinal between St. Thomas Aquinas and Central Catholic at Lowell Klinefelter Field. Both teams will have the opportunity to eliminate their biggest rival from the Austintown Division III bracket. More importantly, the winner will advance to the district finals and keep the season alive. “It’s a big rivalry game,” Aquinas head coach Horlando Manay said. “Both squads are really going to want to do well. A victory under these circumstances would mean a lot.” The addition of a rival to the mix makes what can be an exciting and nerve-wracking wait for game time all the more excruciating. “You have to keep your emotions under control,” Central head coach Tony Volpe said. “Any game against Aquinas is a big game, but you need to prevent yourself from getting too emotional. We will be looking to stay focused.” The most nerves might be experienced by the fans. This will be the second meeting of the season between the two rivals. The Crusaders prevailed 3-2 in a tight match in September. “Aquinas is a tough team,” Volpe said. “Rachael Adams is a really good player for them up front. She’s very dangerous and we need to do a better job on her than we did in the first game.” Central has no shortage of scoring options up front of its own, though. “Olivia Bast is always dangerous on the wing for us,” Volpe said. “She brings a lot of speed and can get to the post quickly. Kasie Perretta controls the ball well and can shoot well. McKenna Waltenbaugh is tall, fast and can also shoot. “Game to game, it has been somebody different that has been coming up big for us.” The Knights employ a lot of pressure and play at a fast pace. Aquinas hopes that recipe will lead to a win in this meeting. “The last game against Central was close,” Manay said. “We made a mistake and lost by a goal. We have to leave that in the past. We have to focus on being prepared and keeping the ball in front of us.” No matter what happens, nothing will take away from the journey that both teams have had to reach this point. Aquinas is a small squad featuring just 15 girls this season. While small in overall numbers, the group has proven to be large in heart. “We don’t have many numbers,” Manay said. “The girls have all done a very good job this year, and we are coming into this game riding on a wave of momentum. We have seven seniors that really enjoy playing together, and I’m expecting them to give it everything they’ve got.” Page 2 of 2 - For Central, the season has forged lifelong bonds. “They are really close-knit,” Volpe said. “You can find them together before and after games. It really is a family atmosphere with them. They are all going to come out and do everything they can to keep the season going.” Reach Cliff at 330-580-8494 or cliff.hickman @cantonrep.com On Twitter: @chickmanREP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:12:26.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
