Pic/Suresh KK \nThe Matunga outfit got the lead in the 17th minute from an own-goal by Campion's Krish Suri. The win put Don Bosco on top of Pool 'D' with three wins from three matches, but has made the fight for second place very interesting. With just two games to play, Cathedral & John Connon, St Stanislaus and Campion are tied at four points having won one, drawn one and lost one.\nStanislaus is currently second with a better goal difference (+8) after they thrashed Colaba Municipal School 9-0 yesterday. Campion stand third (zero goal difference) while Cathedral & John Connon are fourth (-1 goal difference).
