Ellsbury, CF\n2. Gardner, LF\n3. A-Rod, DH\n4. Beltran, RF\n5. McCann, C\n6. Bird, 1B\n7. Headley, 3B\n8. Ackley, 2B\n9. Gregorius, SS\nSP: Michael Pineda, RHP (12-9, 4.24)\n- Well, the scenario remains the same as yesterday. A Yankee win or a Houston loss means the Yanks will host Tuesday night’s wild card game at the Stadium. If the Yankees were to host the game, Joe Girardi figures to hold a workout Monday in the Bronx. If they’re on the road, the manager isn’t sure if they’ll work out.\n- Girardi on how he’ll play it today: “We’re going to do everything we can to win. In saying that, I have to be smart about it, too. I can’t burn guys out in the bullpen in the sense that if I needed two innings out of them Tuesday I couldn’t use them. It’s tricky but we’re going to do everything we can to win. It’s not like we haven’t been doing that the whole season so I don’t see any reason to stop today.”\n- Girardi is bothered a bit by one aspect of having all teams play essentially at the same time today, for drama purposes. “If it’s a sunny day you’re playing in shadows and if it’s the most important game of the year, I don’t think it’s right,” the manager said. “I understand what they’re trying to create. Then, play all night games.”\n- The manager officially named Masahiro Tanaka as his Wild Card starter. Tanaka threw a bullpen on Sunday and will be on his usual one extra day of rest for Tuesday’s game.\n- Dellin Betances has pitched three of the last four games so Girardi would like to avoid using him today if at all possible. But you’ll likely see both Justin Wilson and Andrew Miller in this game.\n- Girardi on playing Tuesday at home or on the road: “You need to win one game (and) we’ve played well on the road the second half, too. Would we rather have it at home? Absolutely. But you still have to go out and get hits and make pitches. So, the best team is going to win on Tuesday, that’s the bottom line.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:09:29.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
