But so is 40 year old backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, who led the Colts to a 16-13 OT win over Jacksonville Sunday. Indianapolis signed a third quarterback, Josh Johnson, basically off the street last week. It's likely either Luck or Hasselbeck will start Thursday night, and that is a big different for a Texans' defense that ranks 11th in the NFL in yards allowed.Houston has quarterback issues of their own. Head coach Bill O'Brien can't seem to make up his mind whether he believes Brian Hoyer or Ryan Mallett is the best quarterback to lead his offense. So far, both haven't been too bad - the Texans rank 7th in the league in yards. But at 1-3, Houston still feels like the more desperate team.Indianapolis is 2-2, and in first place all alone in what is likely the worst division in football. A win on the road, on a short week, short-handed at quarterback, against a division foe - might turn out to be one of the biggest wins of the year.
