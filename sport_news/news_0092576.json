By VINNIE DUBER - editorial@kcchronicle.com \nThe transition to life as a college student and college athlete has been a good one for Kayla Stolfa. But it hasn’t come without work. \nStolfa is a freshman women’s soccer player at Eastern Illinois and a former Batavia athlete. She’s had the fortune of being able to spend a lot of time on the field in her first season, appearing in 11 of the team’s 13 games. Playing defense, she hasn’t racked up a lot of scoring stats, but the valuable experience right off the bat has her feeling good about how things are going on the field. \n“It’s been going pretty well. I’ve been getting a decent amount of time,” Stolfa said. “As a whole, as a team, it’s kind of been a regrouping year because there’s 11 freshmen in our class. So it’s been a learning year for us. Our record doesn’t show that we’ve been doing very well, but we’ve been putting up a fight with every team that we come across.” \nIt is a big freshman class, one that makes up more than one third of the Panthers’ roster. And because of that, there’s plenty to work on. The team has a 2-9-2 record. \nMoving forward, Stolfa said she and her team need to improve communication. With a big group of first-year players trying to mesh with a big group of more experienced players, there have been moments where on-field communication hasn’t been at ideal levels. \n“Communication is probably the biggest thing because being able to communicate with the rest of your team is a huge part of soccer,” Stolfa said. “If you’re not on the same page as your teammates, it’s all going to go wrong. That’s what I need to work on. \n“It’s kind of been like the freshmen get along pretty well and the upperclassmen get along really well. But together, it’s kind of been a little hard, I guess.” \nAnd there’s been work off the field, too. Stolfa said the academic transition has been as good as the athletic one, perhaps most importantly because of what athletics provides. \n“The soccer team, we have to have a certain amount of study hours at our academic place with all the athletics academic advising,” she said. “Having those study hours, it forces you to sit down and study for awhile. It makes it a lot easier to get it done.” \nStolfa is a biology major hoping to get into physical therapy. It’s a course that makes sense for an athlete, and she said it was her own experience having to go through physical therapy after an injury in high school that sparked her interest. \n“My freshman year of high school, I fractured my back. And I had to go to physical therapy for that, and when I was there, I learned a lot from people,” she said. “I just want to help people get back to normal life. It’s hard being injured or having struggles in your daily life. I just want to help people.” \nHelping is a common theme for Stolfa whether she’s on the field or off it. In addition to that career path, she used the word when talking about her position on the field. \nThough her coach said he might use her at forward at times – she’s fast, or so people tell her – she’s fine playing defense. \nWhatever helps. \n“I like where I’m at right now. As long as I’m helping the team out, that’s all I really care about,” Stolfa said. “He said that he might put me at forward sometimes, like if we need speed up top. I guess I’m pretty fast, I don’t know. That’s what everyone tells me. \n“As long as I’m helping people out, then I’m good with what I’m doing.” \n• Vinnie Duber writes the weekly On Campus column on area athletes competing in college.
