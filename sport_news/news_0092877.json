We can come back in Kazan. That is the next challenge,\" he added. \nMarko Devic scored a surprise opener for the visitors, who are fifth bottom in the Russian Premier League, but after captain Oleg Kuzmin was sent off for a second bookable offence Emre Can equalised via the resulting free-kick. \nLiverpool should have pressed home their numerical advantage but the closest they came to a winner was when substitute Christian Benteke's shot hit a post. \n\"Sometimes it is a big advantage against 10 men, most of the time they stop playing football and defend in a compact block,\" said Klopp. \n\"We had our moments and hit the post through Christian but at the end (there was) no goal.\" \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
