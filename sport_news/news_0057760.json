But life goes on.\n\"We played quite well, a draw would have been deserved.\"\nGuardiola refused to pin the blame for defeat on his goalkeeper -- \"we didn't lose because of Neuer\" -- but captain Philipp Lahm admitted it was a bitter defeat.\n\"For the most part we controlled the match well,\" said the ex-Germany captain.\n\"If our build-up play is good our opponents can hardly press â€“ and that's what happened here.\n\"We had some problems before the break because we were too aggressive.\n\"The defeat is very, very bitter. We had great chances against a very, very good team, but at the decisive moments we didn't score.\"\nThe defeat was Bayern's first of the season, after 12 straight wins, and tightens things up in the Group F table.\nGuardiola's Bavarians remain top by virtue of goal difference from Olympiakos, who enjoyed a 1-0 win at beat Dinamo Zagreb on Tuesday.\nThird-placed Arsenal still have little margin for error ahead of their trip to Munich in a fortnight, but they can still make the knockout stages for a 16th successive year.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:56:07.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
