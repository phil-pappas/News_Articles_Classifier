(Photo: AFP) Dubai: The ICC on Monday withdrew Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar from officiating in the remaining two matches of the ongoing one-day series between India and South Africa in the wake of Shiv Sena gheraoing BCCI chief Shashank Manohar forcing cancellation of talks with PCB chief Shaharyar Khan.\nDar, a member of the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, had officiated in the first three matches and was also scheduled to umpire in the fourth and fifth ODIs in Chennai and Mumbai on October 22 and 25, respectively.\nThe ICC made the decision following today's incident in Mumbai where a group of Sena activists stormed the BCCI offices, and threatened to prevent the umpire from standing in the fifth ODI on Sunday.\nManohar and Khan were to discuss the resumption of the Indo-Pak cricket ties and unofficial talks might be held in Delhi on Tuesday. \"Under the present circumstances, it will be unreasonable to expect from Aleem that he will be able to perform his duties to the best of his abilities. As such, he has been withdrawn and his replacement will be announced in due course,\" an ICC spokesman said.\nMeanwhile, BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur had said that Dar's presence will not be affected by any threat from any group. \"There was a possibility of a protest in Saurashtra as well. 50,000 people were supposed to turn up in Rajkot. So I am not going into any threat perception. The fact is that India will also host the T20 World Cup in 2016 and it is the responsibility of every Indian to keep our image of sportmanship alive,\" Thakur said.\n Cricket Team India South Africa BCCI Aleem Dar Shiv Sena ICC Also Read Anurag Thakur virtually rules out Indo-Pak cricket series Pakistan players may refuse to tour India for World T20: ICC President Zaheer Abbas Shiv Sena workers barge into BCCI office, talks with PCB chief rescheduled Declare Shiv Sena as a “terrorist organisation”, says Pakistan Punjab Assembly to UN", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151019/sports-cricket/article/icc-withdraws-aleem-dar-india-south-africa-series", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Dar_AFP_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Dar_AFP_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:57:33.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
