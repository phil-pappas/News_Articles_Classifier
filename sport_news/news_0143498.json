Spiller used his speed on a wheel route to catch an 80-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Drew Brees and lift the New Orleans Saints to a 26-20 overtime victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night at the Mercedes Benz Superdome. Broncos hold off Vikings \nBrandon McManus kicked three field goals, including a 39-yarder with 1:51 remaining, and the Denver Broncos hung on to beat the Minnesota Vikings 23-20 Sunday to remain undefeated.Peyton Manning, shaking off two interceptions, led the Broncos into position for the tie-breaking score with C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman also contributing key runs. Hillman had 103 yards rushing, including a 72-yard touchdown run.Denver, off to a 4-0 start for the seventh time in franchise history and the second time in the last three years, sealed the win when blitzing safety T.J. Ward ended the last-ditch possession of Minnesota (2-2) at midfield by sacking quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and forcing a fumble that linebacker Von Miller recovered. Bridgewater previously extended the drive with an 11-yard run on third-and-10.Up by a field goal at the half, the Broncos gained additional separation when Manning started the third quarter by leading the offense down the field, finishing the drive with a 1-yard touchdown pass on fourth down to wide open tight end Owen Daniels.But the Vikings came back to pull to within three points again. Facing fourth down and inches, the Vikings gave the ball to Adrian Peterson on a run up the middle. He broke through Denver's bunched-up defense at the line of scrimmage and into the clear for a 48-yard touchdown run cutting the Broncos' lead to 20-17 with 10:01 remaining.Minnesota tied it at 20-all on Blair Walsh's second field goal, a 33-yarder with 5:11 left to play that was set up by safety Harrison Smith's interception of Manning, the Denver quarterback's second pick of the game. Manning was 17 of 27 for 213 yards.Linebacker Anthony Barr stepped in front of wide receiver Andre Caldwell to intercept Manning the first time, returning it 32 yards to the Broncos' 27-yard line to set up the touchdown that pulled Minnesota to 13-10 at halftime.Bridgewater completed successive passes to wide receiver Mike Wallace, the second a 4-yarder in the end zone with 12 seconds left  .Denver scored on the first play after Blair Walsh's 38-yard field goal try wide sailed wide left. With the ball at the Broncos' 28-yard line, Manning pitched the ball to Hillman. Daniels sprung him with a block on the edge and Hillman raced untouched down the left sideline en route to matching the fourth-longest touchdown run in Broncos' history.NOTES: Broncos LB DeMarcus Ware is the only player in the league with at least one sack in each of the first four games. … Denver is the only team in the NFL this season yet to allow a point in the first quarter. … Rookie LT Ty Sambrailo missed the game with a shoulder injury. … Minnesota was without WR Charles Johnson because of a rib injury. Also held out was S Andrew Sendejo (knee). … The Vikings were in Denver for the first time since 2007, Adrian Peterson's rookie season. Chargers beat Browns with late FG \nRookie Josh Lambo's 34-yard field goal with no time remaining lifted the San Diego Chargers past the Cleveland Browns 30-27 on Sunday.Lambo was wide right from 39 yards with two second left, but defensive back Tramon Williams was called offside, giving Lambo another chance.The Browns pulled to within 27-25 on tight end Gary Barnidge's 1-yard scoring catch with two minutes to play. Wide receiver Taylor Gabriel caught Josh McCown's pass for a 2-point conversion to tie the game, 27-27.Philip Rivers threw this third touchdown pass, a 1-yarder to tight end John Phillips, with 7:26 remaining. That gave the Chargers an eight-point lead, their biggest of the afternoon.Phillip's score was set up by a 68-yard reception from wide receiver Dontrelle Inman.Rivers completed 23 of 38 for three touchdowns and 358 yards.McCown was 32 of 41 for two touchdowns and 356 yardsTravis Coons booted his fourth field goal, this one from 40 yards, to slice the Browns' deficit to 20-19 with 10 minutes to play.The Chargers seized a 20-16 third-quarter edge when tight end Ladarius Green used his height advantage to reach over strong safety Donte Whitner for a 19-yard touchdown catch. Rivers placed the ball perfectly for Green, who is filling in for the suspended Antonio Gates. Coons converted a 33-yard field goal with six minutes remaining in the third quarter. Coons' kick gave the Browns 16-13 advantage, with the big play of the possession being a 53-yard reception by running back Isaish Crowell.The Browns ran a nifty two-minute offense toward the end of the half, with the result being Coons' 28-yard field goal, tying the game at 13-13.Lambo's 46-yard field goal with 10 minutes left in the half tied the score, 10-10. The drive featured 30 yards rushing on two carries by running back Melvin Gordon.McCown found a great match up early  , spotting linebacker Donald Butler on running back Duke Johnson Jr. Johnson got at least a step on Butler and McCown hit Johnson with a perfect, arching pass in the back of the end zone. Johnson just did get two feet in and it was good for a 10-7 Browns cushion.The Chargers took a 7-3 lead late in the first quarter when Rivers clicked with wide receiver Keenan Allen on a 28-yard scoring strike. Allen, in single coverage with cornerback Pierre Desire, made a diving catch near the goal line for the score. It was Allen's team-high third touchdown reception to cap the 80-yard drive.The Browns struck first when Coons kicked a 36-yard field goal with 4:12 left in the first quarter.NOTES: Injuries forced the Chargers' offensive line to be without three starters: LT King Dunlap (concussion), LG Orlando Franklin (ankle) and C Chris Watt. ...

QB Johnny Manziel was a 28th round pick of the San Diego Padres. Cutler drives Bears past Raiders \nThey were already starting to think it was the \"same old Jay\" on Sunday at Soldier Field when he threw a fourth-quarter interception that the Oakland Raiders turned into a go-ahead field goal against Cutler's Chicago Bears.But, despite the after-effects of a hamstring injury that kept him out of a game last week, Cutler instead played the hero instead of the goat. He drove the Bears 48 yards in the last two minutes, Robbie Gould kicked his third field goal of the game, a 49-yarder with two seconds remaining, and the Bears beat the Raiders, 22-20, for their first victory of the season.Cutler deferred credit to a jury-rigged offensive line, juggled because of injuries, but the difference in the game was the patience he showed — maybe because the hamstring forced him to — in completing 28 of 43 passes, including 5 of 8 on the winning drive.\"There were a lot of moving parts up there, and those guys held their own,\" said Cutler, who acknowledged that he was limited \"a little bit\" physically by the hamstring and deliberately kept himself from trying to scramble out of the pocket.\"He's a tough son of a bug,\" Chicago coach John Fox said of his quarterback. \"He's got an injury that some lesser guys might not have been out there.\"Chicago started the game with a backup replacing injured left tackle Jermon Bushrod and then had to juggle further when center Will Montgomery suffered an apparent broken leg on the third play from scrimmage. As a result, left guard Matt Slauson slid into the center spot and that may have been at least partially responsible for a fumbled snap that led to an Oakland touchdown.But staying in the pocket may prove the best strategy for Cutler, even when his hamstring is fully healthy, because it reduces the margin for error.Instead, it appeared it was the Raiders who made the most grievous error by settling for a field goal with 2:05 remaining to take a 20-19 lead and effect the sixth lead change of the game, rather than play aggressively for a touchdown that might have made a Chicago comeback more difficult.After they got to the Bears' 33-yard line with more than four minutes remaining, Oakland did not throw another pass, instead calling four consecutive running plays before Sebastian Janikowski kicked a 41-yard field goal.\"They were pretty conservative,\" Cutler said.Oakland coach Jack Del Rio defended the play calling, saying, \"I think we felt like we were moving it pretty good and thought we had a better shot to move the sticks on that third-and-two.\"One problem for the Raiders was that, by that point in the game, Del Rio already had benched his leading rusher, Latavius Murray, because of a lost fumble and two dropped passes, one of which Murray bounced into an interception.After the Janikowski kick, the Bears kick-started their winning drive with Cutler's fourth down completion to tight end Martellus Bennett, who caught 11 passes, second highest total of his career, for 83 yards.With the Bears essentially conceding the sideline passes to Cutler — allowing not only completions but clock stappages — the Bears had plenty of time to work downfield. Cutler found Matt Forte for seven yards and then Marquess Wilson for six on 3rd-and-3. After a downfield shot fell incomplete, Eddie Royal made a nifty sideline catch for 12 yards and then Wilson, who earlier on the drive dropped a pass, made a fingertip grab for nine.That was pretty much all Chicago needed and, after running Forte into the line for two, the Bears called on Gould — who, to that point had been the difference in the game due to a blocked extra point.Gould, whose other field goals were from 19 and 54 yards, nailed the winning kick with plenty to spare.\"It was awesome when we were celebrating with two seconds left on the clock,\" Gould said. \"Those are the type of wins you want to see, and usually, those type of wins catapult a team and give them a lot of confidence for the next week.\"There were \"a couple of areas that will stand out,\" Del Rio said, and the most that gnawed on him most clearly was his team's third-down defense. The Bears, who had converted only 16 of 42 third downs into first downs in their three losses, were 10 for 17 in this game.\"They played well, and we didn't play as well as we're capable of,\" Del Rio said. \"These things happen. They get paid, too.\"NOTES: QB Jay Cutler returned to the lineup after missing one game but the Bears played without three injured regulars including No. 1 wideout Alshon Jeffery. Also missing were OLT Jermon Bushrod and NT Jeremiah Ratliff. … The Bears lost C Will Montgomery with an ankle injury on the third play of the game, causing shuffling on the line. LG Matt Slauson moved to center and Patrick Omameh went in at left guard. … Oakland WR Michael Crabtree left the game with an ankle injury   but returned. … Bears FS Antrell Rolle was injured (ankle) on the first play of the third quarter and did not return. Colts beat Jags in OT \nWith franchise quarterback Andrew Luck sidelined by a shoulder injury, the Indianapolis Colts turned to their two oldest players to salvage a 16-13 overtime victory Sunday against Jacksonville in Lucas Oil Stadium.Kicker Adam Vinatieri's 27-yard field goal with 4:36 remaining in overtime gave the Colts (2-2) a much-needed victory. At 42, Vinatieri is the Colts' oldest player.Backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, 40, started in place of Luck and completed 30 of 47 passes for 282 yards, a touchdown and no interceptions.Hasselbeck's 28-yard pass to tight end Coby Fleener -- just after Jaguars' kicker Jason Myers was wide left on a 48-yard field goal that would have won it with 8:13 left -- moved the Colts into scoring position.Running back Frank Gore's 22-yard run set up Vinatieri's final kick.Jacksonville (1-3) had an opportunity to win with one second remaining in regulation, but Myers' 53-yard field goal attempt was just wide right, forcing overtime.The Colts wasted a golden scoring opportunity with 8:19 left in the fourth quarter when Gore fumbled at the Jaguars' 5-yard line, and defensive tackle Abry Jones recovered in the end zone. The fumble was forced by reserve safety Josh Evans and was the second by Gore coughed up in the opposing end zone this season.Indianapolis tied it at 13 with 12:27 to go on Vinatieri's 32-yard field goal after the Colts drove 35 yards in eight plays for the second half's first score.Jacksonville took a 13-10 halftime lead when Myers kicked a 32-yard field goal with four seconds remaining  , capping a 14-play, 65-yard drive that included a 19-yard pass from Blake Bortles to wide receiver Allen Hurns to the Colts' 16.Indianapolis had pulled even at 10 with 6:04 left in the half on Hasselbeck's 2-yard touchdown pass to Fleener. That 13-play, 80-yard drive included five Jaguars' penalties - two pass interference calls, a roughing the passer, a personal foul and an illegal substitution.Bortles 8-yard TD pass to Hurns with 11:37 remaining in the half pushed Jacksonville into a 10-3 lead, capping a 49-yard drive after strong safety Johnathan Cyprien recovered a fumble by Indianapolis running back Josh Robinson. The fumble was caused by linebacker Dan Skuta.Each team kicked a first-quarter field goal - Vinatieri hitting from 54 yards with 4:59 left in the period and Myers from 20 yards at the 2:49 mark after Bortles completed passes of 26 and 48 yards.Jacksonville out gained Indianapolis 210-118 during the opening 30 minutes when Bortles was 14 of 18 for 179 yards and no interceptions. Hasselbeck completed 12 of 21 for 110 yards in the first two quarters.The Colts' 12 first half rushing attempts produced eight yards.NOTES: Colts reserve CB Jalil Brown suffered groin injury in the first half and did not return ... Jaguars MLB Paul Posluszny, who made five first-half tackles, left the game with an ankle injury in the third quarter and did not return ... Before Sunday's game, the Colts were 10-4 all-time against Jacksonville in Indianapolis ... The Jaguars were penalized six times for 47 during the opening half ...

More \nThe Saints (1-3) blew a point-blank chance to win the game in regulation. Kicker Zach Hocker clanged a 30-yard field-goal attempt off the left upright with 12 seconds left, setting up overtime. \nThe Saints won the overtime toss, and it didn't start well, with running back Khiry Robinson dropping a first-down pass from Brees (33 of 41 for 359 yards and two touchdowns). \nOn second down, Spiller blazed out of the backfield down the right sideline and took a perfect strike from Brees, scoring the touchdown just 13 seconds in to overtime. Because the Saints scored a touchdown on their first possession, the Cowboys (2-2) did not have a chance for an overtime possession. \nBrees finished 33-for-41 for 359 yards with two touchdown passes and no interceptions. Spiller caught five passes for 99 yards. \nHocker's miss at the end of regulation blunted a furious 68-yard drive by the Saints inside the final two minutes. Brees completed a 30-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Coleman to the Dallas 17 with 20 seconds left, but regulation ended 20-20. \nCowboys quarterback Brandon Weeden (16-for-26, 246 yards, one TD, no interceptions) led Dallas to the tying touchdown late in the fourth quarter, guiding the Cowboys 91 yards on eight plays. On the drive, Weeden completed passes of 24 yards to wide receiver Terrance Williams, 28 yards to tight end Jason Witten and 19 yards to wide receiver Brice Butler before hitting Williams for a diving 17-yard score with 1:51 left. \nRobinson put the Saints up 20-13 with a 1-yard run midway through the fourth quarter. \nThe victory snapped the Saints' six-game home losing streak and extended Weeden's streak of consecutive losing starts to 10. \nThe Saints took advantage of Dallas having 12 men on the field in a punting situation, picking up 5 yards to allow Hocker to kick a 51-yard field to tie the game 10-10 early in the third quarter. \nThe teams then exchanged field goals. Cowboys kicker Dan Bailey made a 38-yarder, and Hocker added a 29-yarder late in the third quarter to tie the game 13-13. \nBrees' bruised throwing shoulder did not look good on the Saints' first series. His third-and-6 pass for wide receiver Marcus Colston on the left sideline fluttered and should have been intercepted by cornerback Tyler Patmon. \nHowever, after Bailey gave Dallas a 3-0 lead on a 30-yard field goal, Brees seemed to warm up, driving the Saints 80 yards in 11 plays for a 7-3 lead. \nBrees converted two third downs on the drive, including a 7-yard slant to tight end Benjamin Watson for a first down at the Dallas 3. On the next play, Brees faked a shotgun handoff to running back Mark Ingram and hit wide-open tight end Josh Hill for the score. \nThe Cowboys continued to pound the Saints defense on the ground and with Weeden's safe short-passing game. They gained 69 yards rushing in the first quarter and also capitalized on several defensive mistakes by the Saints in their second TD drive. \nThe 80-yard, 10-play march was aided by four Saints' defensive penalties -- holding, hands to the face, facemask and pass interference. On first-and-goal from the 1, running back Joseph Randle leaped and tried to extend the ball over the goal-line with his right hand. \nLinebacker Stephone Anthony stripped the ball, and the Saints appeared to recover at their own 3-yard line. However, an official review overturned the ruling, saying Randle broke the plane for the touchdown before the fumble, putting Dallas up 10-7. \nNOTES: Dallas RB Lance Dunbar was carted off the field early in the third quarter due to a knee injury. ...
