The playoff between the past two continental champs is a mammoth match for the Americans, who finished a miserable fourth in this summer’s Gold Cup. A victory next week at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, will help erase that stain and likely will quiet the questions surrounding the U.S.’s progress under Klinsmann. The eight-team Confederations Cup offers the only opportunity outside the World Cup to play teams from beyond CONCACAF in official competition, as well as a sneak peek at Russia a year in advance. With so much at stake, Klinsmann is relying on experienced, in-form athletes. The 23 players named Saturday were pulled from a 35-man preliminary roster submitted in mid-September . Defenders Omar Gonzalez and John Brooks, midfielder Mix Diskerud and forward Aron Jóhannsson are the most prominent players who failed to make the cut.\nPODCAST: Petr Cech, Laura Harvey interviews; USOC final rewind\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nKlinsmann called the playoff “a game that for the next two or three years to come is probably the biggest game,” the U.S. will play. The manager, who boasts a 5-0-5 all-time mark against Mexico as a player or coach, made it clear that the result may impact the national team’s long-term trajectory. It very well may mark a threshold between eras.\nBIRD: USA into Olympic qualifying semis after routing Cuba “I think it’s really an interesting moment now because you have a core group of players that are kind of running out of time and I just want them to just embrace that moment,” Klinsmann said. “All these guys in their thirties, they need to realize, ‘You know what? I may not be getting these opportunities any more. This is it. We better take that trophy.’ However it looks like, we’ve got to go and get this thing. This is really about chemistry and getting the group together and making it a really special atmosphere the whole week leading into the Rose Bowl moment.”\nWAHL: Judgment Day coming for Klinsmann, USA Here’s a closer look at Klinsmann’s team, which will gather next week for training in Southern California:\nGoalkeepers Brad Guzan (Aston Villa), Tim Howard (Everton), Nick Rimando (Real Salt Lake)\nKlinsmann already has anointed Guzan the starter against Mexico. Howard and Rimando will push the Aston Villa man in practice and will provide sure-handed relief if necessary. In March 2013, Guzan shut out Mexico at the Estadio Azteca in a World Cup qualifier.\nCut: Bill Hamid\n​STRAUS: Guzan seizes chance as USA's No. 1 Defenders Ventura Alvarado (Club América), DaMarcus Beasley (Houston Dynamo), Matt Besler (Sporting Kansas City), Geoff Cameron (Stoke City), Brad Evans (Seattle Sounders), Fabian Johnson (Borussia Mönchengladbach), Michael Orozco (Club Tijuana), Tim Ream (Fulham), Jonathan Spector (Birmingham City)\nGonzalez is the most surprising omission from the roster. The LA Galaxy veteran did well at the 2014 World Cup and played every minute in each of the four most recent matches against Mexico, during which the U.S. yielded only two goals combined. He’s come through before in big games against El Tri, but Klinsmann felt there were other defenders in better form.\n“The competition is very, very tight,” the manager said. “Not having Omar Gonzalez or Mix Diskerud on this roster, for example, is not because they are not good enough. It’s just because you see another player that is better in their position right now in this specific moment. Those are always tough decisions that a coach has to make.”\nWAHL: What's stopping USA from hosting Copa America Centenario? John Brooks, who Klinsmann preferred at the Gold Cup, has been battling injury since playing for the U.S. in the Sept. 4 friendly against Peru (first a thigh, now an ankle). His absence, along with Gonzalez’s, leaves Alvarado, Besler and Cameron at the top of the center back depth chart.\nAlvarado had a rough Gold Cup and spent most of September on the bench at América, but Klinsmann remains a big fan of the 23-year-old.\nKlinsmann has said that his top choices at outside back are Beasley, who’s been capped just twice since the World Cup, and Johnson. Spector, whose brief appearance in the 4-1 loss to Brazil on Sept. 8 was his first in a U.S. shirt in more than three years, has earned another call-up. Along with Tim Ream and Brad Evans, Spector can play in several spots along the back line.\nCut: John Brooks, Greg Garza, Omar Gonzalez\nMidfielders Kyle Beckerman (Real Salt Lake), Alejandro Bedoya (Nantes), Michael Bradley (Toronto FC), Jermaine Jones (New England Revolution), Danny Williams (Reading), DeAndre Yedlin (Sunderland), Graham Zusi (Sporting Kansas City)\nKlinsmann has invested a lot of energy and minutes in Diskerud, who’s demonstrated an ability to make the sort of play that changes a game but hasn’t had a consistent impact this season with New York City FC. He’s a surprising omission from the 23-man team but was always unlikely to start against Mexico.\nPlanet Futbol Video Regardless of Peru, Brazil results, USA has foundation to take on Mexico by Brian Straus", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/BrianStraus"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:20:43.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
