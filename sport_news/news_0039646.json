Taylor combined with Piedmont keeper Michaela Gardner to force the second scoreless draw between these two programs in the last four meetings. \nMaryville created a large advantage with nine corners to three for Piedmont, but Gardner was up to the task several times making key saves throughout as did the Piedmont defense which posted its 12th clean sheet in 15 games now on the season.
