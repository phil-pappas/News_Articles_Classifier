Puskar) Comments \nPittsburgh Steelers defensive end Cameron Heyward isn't going down without a fight. \nThe son of New Jersey football legend Craig \"Ironhead\" Heyward defied the NFL last week when he wore eyeblack paying tribute to his late father (who passed away from brain cancer in 2006), donning the message after the league fined him . \nPLUS: Is putting a Giants jersey on Rocky statue a crime? \nESPN reported Heyward is appealing the $5,787 fine and will cite a very specific case to show why he should continue to use his \"IRON HEAD\" eyeblack to pay tribute: \"Former Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still, whose daughter Leah was an inspiration in her battle with Stage 4 neuroblastoma, wore 'Leah Strong' on his eye black multiple times last season. He did not receive a fine for the practice. Heyward has consulted Still on the matter.\" \nThere's been no word from the NFL about a $11,576 fine for last week's second straight uniform violation. Pro Football Talk reported Heyward won't be suspended if he continues to violate the league's rules about personal messages. \nFollow Charles Curtis on Twitter @charlescurtis82 .
