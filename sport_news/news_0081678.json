I'd have him there all day long,\" Greenwood said at the Beyond Rugby event in central London. \n\"From the outside what you see is samey, samey. Same group making potentially the same mistakes. \n\"If you want a dynamic group of people to come in and go 'Right, what's wrong? What can we do?' Woodward should be in the room and he would say what he thinks.\" \nGreenwood's World Cup-winning team mate Lawrence Dallaglio was also baffled as to why Woodward was not asked to be involved in assessing England's failure to reach the knockout phase for the first time. \n\"Clearly we've arrived at the wrong decision quite a few times now and it's important we arrive at the right decision now,\" Dallaglio said. \n\"The legacy of this World Cup should have been about how the game will grow, but ultimately it will be about who is England head coach. \n\"Clive is English, has had the job before and has won the World Cup, so surely he must be qualified on how things should be taken forward? \n\"But we'll continue to ignore the one person who has actually delivered in this competition. I despair of that a little bit.\" \nThe scope of the review will be to assess preparation and performances and the effectiveness of the coaching, management and support team. It will also consider all feedback given by relevant stakeholders including players.
