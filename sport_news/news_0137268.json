RELATED: Mets' Steven Matz isn't pitching at all now, still injured \nCespedes dropped down to one knee and was slow to get up. Mets trainer Ray Ramirez quickly came out to check on him, as did manager Terry Collins. Cespedes ultimately walked off into the Mets dugout and was taken out of the game. \nThe severity of the injury is not yet known but it would obviously be a dramatic blow to the Mets if it is serious. He entered the night hitting .287 with 17 home runs and a .940 OPS for the Mets in 53 games since they got him at the trade deadline. \nIn that time, the Mets catapulted themselves to a National League East title. \n\"You thought it was going to be easy after we clinched,\" Collins said Wednesday afternoon. \"Didn't you? \nHe didn't know how right he was. The Mets also said Wednesday that Steven Matz was scratched from his start Thursday due to lingering back stiffness. \nYour browser does not support iframes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:46:31.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
