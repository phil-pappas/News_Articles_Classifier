Geneseo boys’ golf coach Kyle Bess wanted to eliminate the urge from his players heads at the 2A Freeport Sectional on Oct. 12. Bess told his players to play relaxed and not worry about their totals and go shot-by-shot during their round at Park Hills Golf Course. The Maple Leafs’ Wyatt Wade couldn’t help himself. He had to know. “I peeked,” Wade said. “I knew 77 would be up there. I didn’t think it would be that low. I thought 73 or 74 would win out there. In the wind, I was happy with a 77.” A senior, Geneseo was paced by Wade’s round of 77 which landed him in a tie for second-place medalist. For the rest of the Maple Leafs team who didn’t look, the wait was worth it. The Maple Leafs became the first boys’ golf team to earn a state berth, and Geneseo did it in style winning the sectional title. “It was pure elation,” Wade said. “It’s one of the best moments I’ve ever had on a golf course. We realized we had won and we were hugging and shaking hands. It was awesome.” Geneseo posted a 319 team total to hold off runner up Wheaton St. Francis (321) in the 12-team field. With the top seven individuals earning medalist honors, the Maple Leafs’ Austin Jump fired a 78 for a share of sixth. Nathan Lauritzen and Ryan Ford each carded an 82 to kept the Geneseo team score low. The Leafs’ Marshall Rice finished with a 92, and Jordan Anderson clubbed a 93. Geneseo had won the regional championship on Oct. 6, but the Leafs knew they were capable of better after shooting a 349-team score. Getting the most out of their depth and having every player contribute has been the calling card of the Maple Leafs season. “On most teams (Ford and Jump) would have to carry them,” Bess said. “If you look at regionals, Jump shot an 87. His quote after that was, ‘The team really carried me.’ “It’s a bonus. Those guys don’t have to play with the expectation and pressure where if they don’t shoot well, then we won’t do well as a team. There’s other guys who can carry the load on any given day to allow those two to relax and focus on their game.” With the stakes raised at the 2A IHSA State meet at Weibring Golf Club at Illinois State University in Normal, Geneseo brings the same attitude of playing loose while they are breaking new ground for the program. Page 2 of 2 - “These guys play well relaxed,” Bess said. “When they are having fun and playing with that mindset and attitude they do well.” But if someone’s having a low round, don’t be surprised if they feel like they have to peek.
