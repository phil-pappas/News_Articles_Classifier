Could New Orleans be a possibility?!' So I'm excited and I'll be there and be cheering them on and I'm excited just to be experiencing it here.\"\nHoliday announced her retirement from club and country soccer shortly after the World Cup and is already scheduled to play her farewell game October 25th in Orlando against Brazil. Now that she is no longer playing club football in Kansas City, she hopes to have an influence on the sport in Louisiana. \"I would love to grow the game here. The women's side...I don't know if it's as big as other states so I would love to see what I can do here and inspire young girls and boys to continue to play the game I love.\"\nTicket information has yet to be released.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
