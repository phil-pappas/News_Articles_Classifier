That was his last regular-season start until Friday, when he stepped into the crease after Semyon Varlamov struggled in Colorado's 1-2 homestand. He also relieved Varlamov and stopped all five shots he faced in a 22-minute stint against Boston on Wednesday. \n\"I feel really good, I'm really happy,\" Berra said. \"I worked really hard the last couple of months for this win ... Especially mentally, I was so confident and saw the puck really good. I didn't care about the score, I just played every puck. The biggest thing about confidence is to have success, to have wins.\" \nBerra also saluted the Avs' penalty-killing, which was staunch as the Ducks went 0-5 with the man advantage and couldn't score in a 6-on-4 advantage after Erik Johnson was called for boarding with 3:37 remaining the Ducks pulled goalie Frederik Andersen. And Colorado ended up credited with 41 blocked shots. Advertisement \n\"The guys played great in front of me,\" Berra said. \"I don't know how many blocked shots and stuff we had. I felt a couple of times that I was beat and I couldn't find the puck ... The guys blocked shots and two times the post saved me. I was also lucky today, but for big wins like that, you need luck.\" \nAnaheim now has scored one goal — yes, just one — in its first four games, going 0-3-1. And this is the team that had 109 points last season, winning a third consecutive Pacific Division title. It all makes for \"what's wrong with the Ducks\" chatter at Orange County's In-N-Out Burger locations or on the sands of Newport Beach. OK, maybe not, but at least among the savvy hockey constituency in the area, this is perplexing — and some of those fans in the sellout crowd were booing at times Friday night. \nBerra became the third goalie to blank the Ducks this season ... all in the span of seven days. Jack Skille and John Mitchell also scored for the Avalanche, now 2-2 heading into a Sunday night meeting with the Los Angeles Kings at the Staples Center.

What I like about our players is we made a great commitment blocking those shots and it was great to see that. We wanted that game tonight and our guys played really hard.\" He said of the Avalanche's overall defensive effort: \"The tracking was phenomenal. We talked about this morning, we wanted to make sure we played well in our zone. We have great leaders in this room and the guys knew that we have to play better defensively if we want to win some hockey games and that's exactly what we did tonight.\" Colorado Avalanche right wing Mikko Rantanen (96), of Finland, shoots the puck toward Anaheim Ducks goalie Frederik Andersen (31), of Denmark, during the first period of an NHL hockey game in Anaheim, Calif., Oct. 16, 2015. ( Alex Gallardo, Associated Press file ) \nAfter the Avalanche spent much of last season appearing as if it had lost confidence in Berra and would do anything to avoid playing him — including shuttling Calvin Pickard between Colorado and the AHL to use him instead — Berra has looked like a bona fide NHL goalie in his last handful of regular-season appearances. And that's not only because he is 6-foot-4 and can seemingly fill the net. \nThis is what Colorado had in mind when it acquired Berra from Calgary at the 2014 trading deadline and nine days later signed him to a three-year, $4.35 million contract extension that locked him up through the 2016-17 season. \nAlthough outshot, the Avalanche also played a much more sound game against the Ducks than in its previous outings with Varlamov in the net. Yet when the Avs required big saves, Berra provided them. \nMacKinnon put the Avs up 1-0 only 53 seconds into the first period, beating Andersen from the outer edge of the right circle. \n\"That was exciting,\" MacKinnon said. \"That was a big game for us. We wanted to get out to a good start and it's always fun to score a big goal like that early. It turned out to be the game-winner because we really locked it down, I thought. It was a solid 60 minutes for us, for the first time this season.\" \nSkille — the veteran winger who made the Avs' roster after coming to camp on a professional tryout — made it 2-0 at 7:11 of the second. From the top of the left circle, Skille one-timed a pass from Nick Holden, and Mikhail Grigorenko, the 21-year-old Russian acquired from Buffalo in the Ryan O'Reilly trade, got the second assist while playing his first game after being a healthy scratch in the first three. \nMitchell iced it with an empty-netter, his fourth goal in four games, with 44.9 seconds left. He had also done significant work up front on the PK all night, along with Carl Soderberg. On defense, Nate Guenin and Holden were effective with the Avs short-handed, and Francois Beauchemin — the former Duck — logged 4:54 of PK time alone. \n\"We just worked hard,\" Mitchell said. \"We tried to keep our shifts short when we had the opportunity. Sometimes you're going to get hemmed in there, but you just have to stay tight and obviously you're going to be blocking shots. Obviously, huge credit to Reto. He played awesome tonight, he played unbelievable. He was seeing pucks and even when he didn't, he was making himself big enough to block them. I think Reto was our best penalty killer, for sure.\" \nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @tfrei", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:14:22.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
