That's up from 44 percent six years earlier.\nRoughly 90 percent of hospitals teach moms breast-feeding techniques and how to recognize and respond to infant feeding cues.\nBut only about a quarter refrain from giving infants breast milk alternatives - like formula or water - unless medically necessary.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed about 2,700 hospitals for the report released Tuesday.\nOverall, about 80 percent of U.S. babies breast-feed, at least briefly.\n___\nOnline:\nCDC report: http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:21:43.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
