It's a safety issue,” parent Bridget Anderson said.\nMayor Murray and City Council President Tim Burgess visited the neighborhood on Wednesday with a promise to build more sidewalks at less cost, if voters pass the $930 million Move Seattle levy.\n“We're going to do 250 sidewalks for the cost of what we would have done 150 sidewalks for,” said Mayor Murray.\nThe cheaper new sidewalks would be made of asphalt that has been stamped and stained to look like brick.\nThat's quite different from the traditional concrete sidewalks the city will continue to use in neighborhoods closer to downtown.\nSo is the mayor offering “second class” sidewalks?\n“Twenty-five years ago,” said Murray. “I worked for a city councilmember and the big issue was what we were going to do about sidewalks. We haven't done anything. So one of the ways we answer the equity issue is to begin to do something.”\nAfter the mayor left, we took a walk on the cheaper sidewalk with the president of the community council and asked if he felt the new sidewalks were “second class.”\n“No, I don't think so,” said Dan Keefe. “I’m just all for safety and getting as much safe walking surfaces down for the kids going to school.”\nThe Seattle Department of Transportation plans to install the lower-cost sidewalks at the following locations next year:\nNorth Seattle: At least seven blocks on 30th Ave. NE between NE 130th St. and NE 137th St. Southwest Seattle: Two blocks near Arbor Heights Elementary School Broadview Neighborhood: Partnering with Seattle Public Utilities on sidewalk improvements and stormwater control elements Southeast Seattle: Two blocks (locations under evaluation) comment (5)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:13:28.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
