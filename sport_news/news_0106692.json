That’s why I’m out,” Kerr said, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . “I wanted to be clear to you guys and the fans. I want to be upfront about what’s happened. Because I’m still having symptoms, it makes it difficult for me to be on the floor. … \n“The prospects are good. I’m going to heal.” \nKerr had two offseason back surgeries -- on July 28 to repair his injury and then on Sept. 4 to address the leak -- after rupturing a disk in his back during Game 5 of the NBA Finals but is still experiencing headaches and a lack of energy. He was forced to take a leave of absence on Oct. 1. \nWith the season-opener against the New Orleans Pelicans on Oct. 27 just around the corner, the answer to the question of whether Kerr’s health will force him to miss any regular-season action is rapidly approaching. \nKerr won’t put a timetable on his recovery, though, and remains out indefinitely. \n“I have to get my health right before I can coach the team and before I can bring the energy that’s necessary to coach the team,” Kerr said. “I’m extremely bored. It’s not fun. I want to be here. \n“This is my dream job. These are my guys. We’re coming off a title, and the season starts in two weeks. It’s unbelievably frustrating. I want to be here, but I also know that I’ve got to be careful.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:56:31.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
