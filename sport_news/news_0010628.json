But the gap is much smaller than it was. \nSaban's total pay is $7.09 million in the 2014-15 year, followed closely by Michigan's new coach, according to the USA Today database . Jim Harbaugh is set to pull in $7 million without bonuses. The base pay is actually higher than Saban's $6.9 million, but the Alabama coaches' $425,000 in bonuses vaulted him back to the top spot. \nIn terms of bonuses, Saban's was the ninth largest nationally. Missouri's Gary Pinkel made $900,000 to top the rankings, according to USA Today . Saban's bonuses were still larger than national champion Urban Meyer who made $400,000 above his $5.9 million base pay. \nSaban received three bonuses. A $200,000 check followed Alabama's playoff semifinal appearance. He also got $125,000 for the SEC title and $100,000 for Alabama's academic performance. Scoring above a 930 on the annual APR triggered that bonus. Alabama football scored 978 this year. \nA year ago , Saban was the highest paid coach by a margin of $1.5 million over Michigan State's Mark Dantonio. Saban's total pay actually went down $72,706 from last year, according to USA Today's research .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:16:09.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
