Again, Trocheck had a hand in the only Panthers goal, with an assist, but the result was another defeat in a Panthers campaign that would fall just short of the playoffs.\nTrocheck, now 22, returns to the Consol Energy Center on Tuesday as an established NHL player with hope of celebrating a victory for the first time in front of the large contingent of family and friends that turns out each time he comes to town.\nTrying to keep up with all the ticket requests can be as much of a challenge as he'll face from Sidney Crosby and Co. on the ice, though he has a different strategy this time.\n\"It was a challenge last year. I usually just have my mom deal with them,\" Trocheck said Monday before the Panthers left on a three-game trip that will also take them to Chicago and Dallas. \"Last year I got a suite, had like 25 tickets, but that still wasn't enough. So this year I'm just kind of letting everyone do their own thing.\"\nAlso different is that the 3-2 Panthers are off to a better start than the 2-3 Penguins, and Trocheck is outscoring the player he most admired as a young fan.\nInexplicably, Penguins superstar Crosby has yet to register a mark on the scoresheet, matching a career-worst streak of five games without a point.\nTrocheck scored 1:23 into the opener against Philadelphia, the earliest Panthers goal to start a season. He would contribute three assists to the 7-1 victory against the Flyers for his first four-point game.\nBut momentum shifts quickly in the NHL. Trocheck and linemates Dave Bolland and Jussi Jokinen have produced only one goal in the four games since, an empty-netter by Jokinen.\n\"You'll have your nights. We had our night against Philly that first game. [Saturday] night we were just kind of playing a defensive role,\" Trocheck said of the 4-2 loss to Dallas. \"We've just got to worry about playing our role. We can't sit back; no matter who we're playing against we've still got to be the aggressors.\"\nThat is a team-wide mantra for this trip against three teams that each feature dangerous sharpshooters. The Panthers saw the Stars' star duo of Tyler Seguin and Jamie Benn turn a 2-0 deficit into victory in short order.\nThey are wary of Crosby's scoring slump as indicative only that the league's best scorer is long overdue.\n\"He's having a little struggle right now scoring, but he could get four or five points any night,\" Panthers coach Gerard Gallant said. \"We've just got to make sure we're playing our game again and worrying about our team.\"\nTrocheck is only too familiar with what Crosby and cohort Evgeni Malkin can do on any given night, from his younger days rooting for them night after night. They have been joined this year by another scoring force in Phil Kessel.\nBut Trocheck has an ally from Penguins past glory in Jaromir Jagr, who leads the Panthers in scoring. It would be understandable if the kid from Pittsburgh had to pinch himself now and then between shifts Tuesday to make sure he's not stuck in some unlikely dream.\n\"The first time it was a little surreal playing against the guys I grew up watching, but now I've kind of settled into it,\" Trocheck said. \"Every time I go back I still have 40, 50 people coming to the game to watch. It's still a lot of fun to go and play in front of my family.\"\nTop dogs\nThis first extended trip will present an early gauge of the Panthers' readiness to contend for a playoff spot. Last season they had a knack for playing their best games against the league's upper echelon, including going 3-1 against Detroit and 2-0 against Anaheim.\n\"Last year we earned respect from a lot of those teams. This year we don't want to earn respect, we want to be known as a good team,\" Gallant said.\nLetting a two-goal lead slip at home against Dallas wasn't a step in that direction, so the Panthers have something to prove on this trip.\n\"People look at the schedule and say, 'Well, the first three or four games wasn't real strong competition,' according to last year's standings. But every team is a battle in this league, and you can't take any night off,\" Gallant said. \"I'm looking forward to playing these top teams. â€¦ We've got to be ready to play every period.\"\n Ice Hockey Florida Panthers Travel Pittsburgh Penguins Sidney Crosby NHL Jussi Jokinen", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56256262/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-1020-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:50:48.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
