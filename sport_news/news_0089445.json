The 22-year old posted a 3.22 ERA, the best among rookies with at least 20 starts. Hard-throwing Yordano Ventura got the ball for the Royals. He finished the season with a 2.38 ERA in his last 11 starts.\nBoth pitchers started the first inning by hitting a player on the hand. Neither throw appeared intentional.\nIn the second inning, Royals catcher Salvador Perez was visibly upset after a foul ball hit a young fan. Shortly after that, he hit a two-run opposite field home run, giving the Royals the lead.\nIn the bottom half of the frame, Ventura gave up a home run to centerfielder Carlos Gomez. He gave up a second home run to Carlos Correa in the bottom of the third. Ventura is pitching on short rest.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
