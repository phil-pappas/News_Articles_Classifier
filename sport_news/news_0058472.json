In a complaint filed last week, John “Trey” Enloe III says he now suffers from “traumatic and catastrophic brain injuries” because of a game on Oct. 16, 2014, at Point Loma High School. Concrete Slab Crushes Construction Worker A part of La Jolla High’s junior varsity team, Enloe took a hard hit during the game’s first quarter. He soon started complaining of “a headache and nausea, and was noticeably rattled, confused, and unable to follow simple direction,” the complaint says. Enloe approached the team’s assistant coach, Steven Wachs, and told him something was not right, according to the document. SDPD Tows Van in Deadly Hit-and-Run Investigation Wachs allegedly told him “he did not have time” for Enloe and demanded the player return to the game, Enloe says. When the student returned to the game, he suffered a second hard hit. Later that night, Enloe was taken to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a serious concussion. Wachs was later suspended from his role as assistant coach. Crash Kills 2 South County Teachers Enloe is still recovering from the injuries and may never recover fully, the complaint says. NBC 7 has reached out to Wachs, but we have not heard back. He previously told NBC 7’s media partner Voice of San Diego that neither Enloe nor anyone else told him the athlete was injured. Report: CBP Agents Use of Force Incidents Drop The former player claims the San Diego Unified School District coaches, staff and personnel acted carelessly and negligently when they failed to recognize the signs of Enloe’s injury and put him back in the game. According to the complaint, the district holds responsibility for failing to hire “competent athletic department personnel,” failing to train the personnel to recognize and address symptoms of serious head injuries, and failing to establish rules on what to do if players have a potential head injury.

The complaint seeks general and special damages from the district, including medical and health care-related expenses and costs of the suit. Photos Pres.
