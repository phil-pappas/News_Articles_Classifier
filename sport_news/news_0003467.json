The 74-year-old Pele, who graced the boys' Under-17 summit clash of Subroto Cup tournament, sent the near full house stadium of 20,000 capacity into frenzy as he made a round trip of the ground on an open top Indian Air Force jeep on the final day of his India visit, which commenced in Kolkata on October 11.Pele, who arrived here on October 14, gave away the winners' trophy to All India Football Federation team which beat Little Angels Paradise School, Thoubal, Manipur 4-1 in the final in a ceremony which was attended by Chief of the Air Staff Arup Raha. He will leave for Brazil in the wee hours tomorrow.Surprisingly, Pele was not asked by the organisers to address the enthusiastic crowd at the stadium who shouted 'Pele Pele' for most part of the evening. Sporting a light blue shirt and trouser with black shoes, Pele stood silent on the dais even as Air Marshall Raha addressed the crowd.But the Delhi football fans did have an evening they will cherish throughout their lives as they saw the man who is known by many names, including the 'Black Pearl', 'King Pele' or 'King of Football', from close range in flesh and blood.Just after arriving at the stadium and several people trying to come close and get autographs from him, Pele was asked to proceed to the ground so that the players of the two teams and match officials could introduce themselves.Pele, who has had three surgeries this year, including the recent one in his hips, struggled to get down from the dais and onto the ground. He clutched his right hand on his walking stick while the left hand was held by a companion even as another Air Force officer lent him support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:34:39.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
