Angela Ripley is in her first year as head band director after serving for five years as an assistant. She says the students put in long hours of practice despite the fact that many of them are involved in other activities.\n\"We have about on sixth of the student body. We have athletes from every sport from football to cross country, to all soccer teams both girls and guys, volleyball just about everybody is in the band,\" said Ripley.\nRipley says the students work just as hard in the classroom. She says the band has long tradition of high academic performance among it's members. Their halftime show features music by the band Queen. In addition to a large group of talented musicians they also has six member flag corps. Band members say it's a challenging routine but the hard work pays off when they are playing in front of a huge crowd on a Friday night.\n\"Once I get up there an I'm doing it. I just get into it. I don't even think about the crowd. I'm just thinking about the band, trying to make them better and when it's all over I feel so good about it,\" said Field Commander, Nathan Clemons.\n\"When I first started marching I couldn't march and play at the same time. I had to practice and seeing the new members practice that makes me happy because I know how difficult it is to get your feet, your mouth and mind all working together at the same time,\" said senior, Abigail Heart.\n\"I love the ability to express yourself through playing an instrument. Most art forms you can be able to express how you feel so when I play my trumpet I can express how I feel through the trumpet,\" said senior, Kaleb Kimble.\nThis Friday night the band will put on what promises to be a spectacular halftime show. It's called their lights out show. The stadium lights will turned off and the members will wear lighted costumes throughout the performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:09:49.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
