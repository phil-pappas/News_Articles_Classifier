At season’s end, the top 10 players on the Volvik Race For The Card money list will graduate to the LPGA Tour next year. The $15,00 0 first-place prize could go a long way to making that dream come true for one of the hopefuls.\nOne of those is former LPGA Tour member Vicky Hurst, a 2011 U.S. Solheim Cup member who stands seventh on the list entering the IOA. Hurst, who has won titles in two of her last five starts on the Symetra Tour, saw her LPGA Tour career cut short when she suffered a wrist injury in 2013. She hopes to make it back there next season with a good showing this week.\n“If I hit a lot of balls or if the ground is really firm, I’ll feel something, but nothing serious,” said Hurst. “After a tough workout I might feel something, but it is much better now.”\nAbout the pressure of re-gaining her LPGA status she said, “The best way to not think about it (money list) is to focus on the hole I’m on and the shot I have,” said Hurst. “I need to just stick with my routine and game plan, especially on this golf course. This course is tough with narrow fairways.”\nThe 3rd annual IOA Golf Classic will feature 118 professionals and two amateurs competing in a 54-hole stroke play event. The field is one of the strongest the Symetra Tour has ever seen. There are four LPGA Tour winners - Charlotta Sorenstam (2000 Standard Register Ping), Heather Bowie Young (2005 Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic), Silvia Cavalleri (2007 Corona Championship) and Jimin Kang (2005 LPGA Corning Classic and 2010 Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia). There are 12 players in the field with at least one LPGA Tour top 10 finish.\nFirst-round play begins on Friday, October 9 at 7:45 a.m. from the first and tenth tees. There will be a cut to the top 70 and ties following second round play on Saturday. The final round will begin at 8:00 a.m. and a one-tee start will be used with an approximate finishing time of 4:30 p.m.", "external_links": ["http://www.alaquacc.com/events/ioa-golf-classic", "http://symetratour.lpga.lightmakercloud.com/volvik-race-for-the-card"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:15:56.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
