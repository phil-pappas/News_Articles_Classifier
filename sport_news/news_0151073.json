Photo: Marko Metzinger for The Wall Street Journal “THIS GAME—IT’S a rabbit’s hole. After only four moves, there’s more than 300 billion options to consider.” So declares actor Peter Sarsgaard, portraying the coach of legendary chess king Bobby Fischer in the new biopic “Pawn Sacrifice.”\nNovices making their opening moves in acquiring a chess set can feel similarly daunted, considering all the options: miniature travel-friendly versions (often with magnetic pieces and roll-up boards); wooden boards of various sizes and grains, not to mention precious-stone and marble ones; elaborate ornamental and memorabilia sets with themes ranging from the Battle of Waterloo to “Star Trek.” Battle pieces come in plastic, wood, metal and a wealth of rare and exotic materials. Forty-thousand-year-old Woolly Mammoth ivory, anyone?\nThe half dozen chess historians, collectors and grandmasters we interviewed provided these winning strategies.\nAdvance with Staunton. While chess originated in 6th-century India, it wasn’t until 1849 that the pieces we’re familiar with today were standardized. Known as Staunton Pattern pieces, they consist of a king crowned with a cross (the tallest piece), a coronet-topped queen, realistically rendered horse-head knights, castle-shaped rooks, slash-ingrained bishops and simple round-headed pawns.\nStyled Horses Noble knights from four smart sets ENLARGE Clockwise from top left: Savano Series Artisan Chess Pieces, $1,195, houseofstaunton.com; Calvert Faux Ivory Chess Set and Board, $249, houseofstaunton.com; Rosewood Camelot Chess Men, $162, chessngames.com; Large Staunton Metal Men, $333, chessngames.com Photo: Marko Metzinger for The Wall Street Journal The design offered functional benefits that hold up today. The varying heights of the pieces reduced the chance that pawns could “hide” behind other pieces, said Jon Crumiller, one of the foremost collectors of antique sets and a tournament player himself.\nThe Staunton set was originated by architect Nathaniel Cook, manufactured by Jaques of London and named after Howard Staunton, the world’s top player at the time. Today, Staunton Pattern chessmen are the only style sanctioned for competitive play.\nEven if you’re just in it for fun, Maxim Dlugy, a chess grandmaster and a consultant on “Pawn Sacrifice,” recommends simplicity. “Some of the decorative sets are difficult, less manageable to play with,” he said. “Of course, if you are willing to be Star Trek’s Mr. Spock out of sentimentality and your opponent feels the same, go for it.”\nPick your price point. While top-line sets—featuring ornate, hand-carved chessmen and boards made of expensive woods—can run $20,000 and more, you can find a sturdy, handsome set for much less. Shawn Sullivan, Managing Director of Huntsville, Alabama-based manufacturer the House of Staunton said quality sets can be had for well under $100. His company’s “economy line” is its fastest-growing division. “Quality, when it comes to chess sets, doesn’t have to break the bank,” Mr. Sullivan said.\nChoose your chessmen. A common misconception is that plastic chess pieces weigh less than wood chessmen. But this isn’t the case, according to Mr. Sullivan. “Unless you’re talking about a hollow plastic chess set you buy at a Rite Aid or Toys ’R’ Us, the vast majority—wood or plastic—are weighted with a metal slug in the base,” he said. Chess retailers often tout the fact that their pieces are weighted, but it’s a given.\nRelated Bridging the Generation Gap With Chess In Chess, Variability in Play Is Not Dumb Luck Top 10 Chess Culture Shocks: Expat Student Champs in the U.S. Tell All WSJ. Magazine: Magnus Carlsen\n’s Parents on Raising the World’s Best Chess Player So should you go with plastic or wood? In general, the latter provides the most lasting value. “Properly kept it will last a lifetime,” said chess grandmaster Yasser Seirawan. But don’t discount plastic. The Play Magnus Educational Chess Set, codesigned by 24-year-old reigning world-champion Magnus Carlsen, has a modernized Staunton styling, a cool matte finish, and a nifty carrying tube. It costs less than $50.\nLevel the playing field. House of Staunton’s Mr. Sullivan suggested that novices begin with a quality roll-up board, which are often used in tournaments, then trade up to a more conventional wooden model. Roll-up sets are lightweight, portable and affordable (as low as $5). “And if you drop it, throw it or even spill on it, it’ll still be perfectly functional,” he said.\nIf you decide to go with a wooden board, chess pro Mr. Dlugy advised purchasing the flat as opposed to the fold-up style. “Solid boards are simply more stationary,” he said. Mr. Seirawan agreed: “A flat board is much preferred as the fold is distracting.”\nAnd remember that the board’s aesthetic can affect game play. The alternating colors on chessboards should be muted—“soft to the eye, not glaring or highly reflective, as players study the board for hours at a time,” said Mr. Seirawan. “Tanned wood earth tones are preferred. Harsh black and red are terrible.”\nFor those looking for a chess set that will appreciate in value, Mr. Seirawan and other experts said that thematic, “collectors’ sets” offer little resale value. In contrast, “beautiful old vintage, wooden chess sets will always have buyers.”\nWhen it comes down to it, purchasing a chess set isn’t as complicated as it seems: “Just avoid sets that are made cheap and look cheap,” said Mr. Seirawan.\nMore in Gear & Gadgets Smart Little Suckers: Next-Gen Robot Vacuums Should Parents Play Videogames With Their Children?
