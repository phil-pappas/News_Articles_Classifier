But he added: \"I actually feel the lines continuing to arc away from each other, incident by incident, video by video.\"\nMost of the country's 50 largest cities have seen an increase in shootings and killings, he said, citing Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas and others. In Washington, D.C., he said homicides are up more than 20 percent. And he added that Baltimore is averaging more than one homicide a day — a rate higher than New York City, which has 13 times the people.\n\"Why is it happening ... all over and all of a sudden?\" he asked. \"I've heard a lot of theories — reasonable theories.\"\nHe suggested other factors, including the availability of cheaper heroin, guns getting into the wrong hands for wrongdoing, and street gangs becoming smaller and more territorial.\nBut he said his conversations with officers often come back to cellphones. He said they describe encounters with young people and their cellphone cameras \"taunting\" them \"the moment they get out of their cars.\"\n\"They told me, 'We feel like we're under siege and we don't feel much like getting out of our cars,'\" Comey said.\nHe said he has been told about higher-ranking police telling officers \"to remember that their political leadership has no tolerance for a viral video.\"\nA spokesman for the ACLU of Illinois , Ed Yohnka, said later Friday he disagreed with Comey's assessment.\n\"Police officers who respect civilians and the law will only enhance the reputation of their departments when recorded by civilians,\" Yohnka said. \"And officers should be trained to conduct themselves with professionalism regardless of whether a camera is recording them.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.law.uchicago.edu/", "http://embed.newsinc.com/Single/iframe.html?WID=2&VID=29637948&freewheel=91223&sitesection=advance&height=349&width=620", "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/10/05/bloody-baltimore-post-freddie-gray-spike-in-homicides-shootings-continues/", "http://www.aclu-il.org/"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:37:20.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
