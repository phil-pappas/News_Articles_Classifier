(Associated Press) \nGood morning! \nThe U.S. women’s national team will resume the World Cup victory tour tonight in Seattle with the first of two meetings against Brazil. About 21,000 tickets have been sold for the friendly at CenturyLink Field. Kickoff is at 10 p.m. ET on ESPN2 and WatchESPN. The second meeting comes Sunday at Orlando’s Citrus Bowl (2:30 ET, Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports Go). Ticket sales in Florida have hit 30,000. Tonight’s match marks the international farewell for midfielder Shannon Boxx. Sunday is the end for Lauren Holiday and Lori Chalupny. Coach Jill Ellis summoned 31 players for the two matches . \nThe National Women’s Soccer League has added a 10th club: Orlando Pride, owned by the group that runs MLS’s Orlando City . The new team will begin play next year at the Citrus Bowl. MLS clubs now operate three NWSL teams; Portland and Houston are the others. To supply Orlando with players, the NWSL will conduct an expansion draft Nov. 2. The Pride will also have the first pick in each round of the college draft in January. \nQuarterfinal slots in the 2015-16 CONCACAF Champions League are almost set, and it’s looking like an all-MLS/Mexican competition. D.C. United, the Los Angeles Galaxy, Real Salt Lake and Seattle Sounders have secured passage. So have Club America, Santos Laguna and Queretaro. The final berth will be settled tonight as Tigres needs only a draw at home against Costa Rica’s Herediano. The first leg of the knockout stage will take place in late February. Pairings are based on point totals in group play. At the moment, it’s looking like United will face Queretaro or the Galaxy. \nI’m hearing the Philadelphia Union has narrowed its search for a sporting director/team executive to two well-known European-based figures: former U.S. national team forward Earnie Stewart, who runs football operations for Dutch club AZ Alkmaar, and former German international Fredi Bobic, the ex-director of football at Stuttgart. \nMLS tonight: Sporting Kansas City will clinch a playoff berth and jump into third place in the Western Conference by defeating the last-place Colorado Rapids at Sporting Park (9 ET, MLS Live). \nAt the Under-17 World Cup in Chile, the United States raced to a two-goal lead before settling for a 2-2 draw with Croatia , leaving the Americans (0-1-1) in need of victory against the host team Friday in order to secure passage to the round of 16. \nAmericans abroad: \nTuesday \nD Eric Lichaj played 90 minutes and scored in the 73rd in Nottingham Forest’s 1-1 draw with Burnley [ video ] \nMF Danny Williams played 90 in Reading’s 1-1 draw at Rotherdam United \nD Jonathan Spector entered in the 73rd of Birmingham City’s 1-0 victory at Bolton Wanderers \nGK William Yarbrough played 90 in Leon’s 2-0 victory over Cruz Azul in Copa MX \nMF Joe Corona entered in the 57th minute and converted during a shootout as Veracruz lost at Chivas after a 1-1 draw in Copa MX \nWednesday \nMF-D Fabian Johnson and Moenchengladbach at Juventus in UEFA Champions League (2:45 ET, ESPN2, WatchESPN, foxsoccer2go.com) \nD Tim Ream and Fulham vs. Leeds United \nD Michael Orozco, MF Alejandro Guido and F Paul Arriola for Tijuana at Atlas in Copa MX (9 ET, ESPN Deportes, Galavision, WatchESPN) \nMF Jose Torres and Tigres vs. Herediano in CONCACAF Champions League (8 ET, Univision Deportes, foxsoccer2go.com) \nOn the college soccer front, 20th-ranked Maryland scored an 88th-minute equalizer, then conceded the winning goal 65 seconds later in a 2-1 home defeat to Delaware. Typically invincible at home, the Terps (6-4-4) fell to 3-3-2 at Ludwig Field. They will host No. 17 Washington on Friday. Steven Goff is The Post’s soccer writer. His beats include D.C.
