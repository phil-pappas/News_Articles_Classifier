In five games, the Kings have been fairly dismal on the power play (10.5 percent) and stellar on the penalty kill (90.5 percent).\nThat’s more in line with the Kings’ stats from 2009-14, and in contrast to last season, in which they tied for 11th in power-play efficiency (19 percent) and tied for 16th in penalty killing (80.9 percent).\nIt’s not necessarily an either-or situation – there’s nothing stopping a team from being great at both – but the Kings built their recent success largely on stout defensive play and desire a return to it.\n“Off and on it was good (last year),’’ center Trevor Lewis said, ``but I think for this team, our penalty kill is such a momentum boost for us. When we get a big kill, you can see the guys on the bench get up and get a little bit more energy, so I think it’s a big part of what we need to improve on this year.’’\nIt’s unwise to draw many conclusions from exhibition games, because it’s rare that a full complement of veteran players is in the lineup, but the Kings’ penalty-killing strength would seem to be encouraging.\nRobyn Regehr and Jarret Stoll, two penalty-killing stalwarts of recent seasons, departed over the summer and another key member of the group, Matt Greene, has been limited by illness and injury.\nThe power play is a great concern. The Kings added Milan Lucic during the summer but have scored just two power-play goals in 19 chances in their five exhibition games.\n“The power play’s up to the top guys,’’ Coach Darryl Sutter said. “I mean, you give them fundamentals and basics and different breakouts and things like that, but at the end of the day, they’ve got to produce. If they’re not, that’s on them.’’\nSETTLING IN \nThe Kings made a low-impact move when they signed veteran goalie Jhonas Enroth as their backup goalie in July, but Enroth has been one of the surprise standouts of the preseason.\nIn three games, Enroth stopped 45 of 48 shots in 112 minutes. That’s good for a 1.61 goals-against average and a .933 save percentage\n“I’ve been here two to three weeks now,’’ Enroth said, ``and you can tell why these guys have been so successful the last couple of years. They’re true champions, all of them, and it’s a definite step up from what I’ve been used to the last couple of years and I’m excited to be here.’’\nEnroth previously played in Buffalo and Dallas and hasn’t been on a playoff team since 2011.\nMORE PROGRESS \nThe Kings didn’t practice Wednesday, but defenseman Jake Muzzin, who suffered an upper-body injury Sunday, skated for a second consecutive day. It’s not yet known whether Muzzin will be able to play in the Kings’ final exhibition game on Saturday, and the status of Matt Greene (upper-body injury) is also unclear.\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:20:26.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
