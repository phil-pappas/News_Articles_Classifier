By MyJoyOnline \nIs there anything different between what ensued at the 2014 World Cup which warranted a Commission of Inquiry and the M Plaza soap opera involving the All African games Gold winning Black queens and Sports Ministry/Government? \nDon't struggle to puff answers. It's a big no! \nSo, where do I even start?Well, before I draw the seeming similarities between the two scenarios, this is how special our Queens had become after winning gold at the All Africa Games. \nThe national women team since its formation have come close to winning major silverware thrice - 1998, 2002 and now the 2015 All African Games. And that's why this feat represents the biggest achievement for the women's national soccer team, historically. \nYou have to wonder why it took President Mahama 2,016 hours to give the all powerful order for part payment of monies owed the Queens. Or why it took the sports ministry the same number of hours to notify the President that urgent attention was needed to prevent what was fast becoming another embarrassing spectacle for Ghana's statecraft. \nTruly ironic!The last two international shams for Ghana are identical in procedure; they just differ with the occasion. The first was when the Black Stars performed poorly at the 2014 World cup and secondly when the Queens defied all odds to win gold for the country at the All Africa Games. \nAnd interestingly, both scenarios needed emergency phone calls to mitigate highly flammable impasses. \nBut could it also be that personnel at the sports ministry were deliberately delaying monies with the hope of gaining? \nAll of these possible scenarios could be negated or confirmed if Mr President reacts by firing the minister or issuing tough statements about his subjects' unpardonable frailties. \nIf nothing happens then it will be assumed President Mahama only realized at the last hour, that the girls were in no mood to take less than $5000 and gave the order. \nProblem is, all other national teams who followed the M Plaza soap opera have now been socialized into thinking along these lines. \nFirst and foremost, the country will not appreciate you even if you win gold. Therefore there is no need to die for the country and worst of all, when you are owed monies, you must continually use forceful tactics that include screaming on every available media platform. And it also includes striking to arrest the attention of those who matter. \n[PHOTO]http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/Unfortunately, no lessons have been picked from repeated shambolic episodes in our sporting history in the eyes of the world - counting from the May 9 disaster of 2001, the 2011 Maputo sham, 2014 World Cup fiasco and the 2015 Rwanda cash airlifting saga. Now the Black Queen M plaza soap opera becomes the latest in our Hall of Shame. \nWe just don't learn!So let's stop the hypocrisy and tickling ourselves unnecessarily in attempts to give the impression that things are being corrected, only to repeat them in heavier doses. \nWhat we need is a true generational mental overhaul, and soon. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
