A perverted celebrity chef arranged a sexual encounter with an underage Bronx high school student in a Best Buy parking lot and then shared videos of the sick deed online, authorities charged Thursday.\nMatthew Tivy, the chef and owner of Café du Soleil in the Upper West Side, faces charges of sex with a minor and distribution of child porn.\nA criminal complaint in Manhattan Federal Court states that the NYPD first arrested Tivy on May 6 for sexual abuse of a minor. After examining the 54-year-old's cell phone, investigators learned of the Dec. 30, 2014 encounter with the student, papers read.\nTivy allegedly arranged the meet-up through the hookup app Grindr.\n“That was really fun,” Tivy texted afterwards, according to papers. “Even though you were very bad not to tell me how young you are haha but I don’t mind.”\nHe added “I’ve been with a high school guy before so it’s cool,” documents charge.\nHe later bragged about the sick meetup.\n“I have one kid that I f---ed in my car. He’s a high school sophomore,” he allegedly wrote. Papers state that the student is now a junior.\nFurther examination of Tivy’s social media accounts revealed he shared sick photos and videos of underage boys — sometimes with other underage teens, papers read.\nHe allegedly boasted of an encounter with a 14-year-old and swapped twisted videos with a 16-year-old living in Florida, the complaint charges. He also had images on his phone of a New Jersey 15-year-old, papers allege.\nTivy is to be presented in Magistrate’s Court this afternoon.\n“Not guilty — at this point, that is the assumption we all must make,” Tivy’s attorney Glenn Hardy said. “Our investigation into this matter will continue.”\nIn addition to earning recognition for his popular restaurant, Tivy has appeared on the Food Network’s “Chef Du Jour” and cooked recipes for seared sea scallops with black truffle vinaigrette and raviolis of Maine lobster with white truffle sauce.\nsbrown@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:17:02.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
