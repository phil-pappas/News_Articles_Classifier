Ragland seems to be making the most of his decision to return for his senior season instead of joining the annual NFL draft exodus for the Tide, which visits No. 9 Texas A&M on Saturday.(Vasha Hunt/AL.com via AP) Browse for Republican American Reprints COLLEGE STATION, Texas - During four seasons of SEC membership, the Texas A&M football program has been home to a Heisman Trophy winner and a destination for blue-chip recruits.A $485 million renovation of Kyle Field, completed in August, has added energy and extra seats to the game-day experience at a facility with a listed capacity of 102,512.But despite the elevated decibel levels in their home venue, one significant commodity is missing from the Aggies' body of work as an SEC member: a signature triumph over a fellow league member in College Station.Although the Aggies have pulled some notable upsets in road venues, they own a 5-7 mark against conference peers at Kyle Field during their brief SEC tenure. That includes an 0-4 mark against the three schools that have combined to win the last eight SEC West titles (Alabama, Auburn, LSU).Football logic and basic math suggest the ninth-ranked Aggies (5-0, 2-0 in SEC) will not play in an SEC championship game until they can hold serve at home against one of the traditional bullies in their division. A&M gets another shot to break through that glass ceiling Saturday against No. 10 Alabama (5-1, 2-1), the defending SEC champion that finds itself in win-or-else mode after dropping a Sept. 19 game to No. 13 Ole Miss, 43-37.The Crimson Tide, a 59-0 winner in last year's matchup against A&M, has been installed as a four-point favorite heading into Saturday's showdown. That only heightens the statement-game opportunity for the Aggies in the estimation of players and coaches.\"It's always fun proving people wrong,\" A&M offensive guard Joseph Cheek said. \"We've got the talent. We have the ability. It's about executing . It's a big game to go out and make people want to shake their heads if they didn't believe in us before. It's all about us.\"For a change, many of the pre-game intangibles seem to favor A&M in a matchup against Alabama, the nation's winningest FBS program since 2008. A&M is playing at home and coming off a bye week that refreshed players and allowed coaches to add new wrinkles to the game plan. A&M (plus-2) ranks higher than Alabama (even) in turnover margin, a factor that often decides close games.But the biggest difference, said quarterback Kyle Allen, is a deep-seeded belief that an improved defense and a productive offense can allow A&M to extend its 5-0 start after hitting the wall at a similar juncture last season. Players believe, Allen said, even though Saturday's opponent is Alabama. Even though A&M's five home wins over SEC peers as a league member have come against teams with a combined SEC record of 12-23.\"The difference is the mindset. It's huge,\" said Allen, who became the Aggies' starting quarterback after last year's loss to Alabama capped a three-game midseason swoon. \"We're a lot more mentally tough and we're physically tougher (this season). I think you can see that's changed our team a lot.\"Allen has compiled an 8-2 record as A&M's starting quarterback, including last year's 41-38 upset of then-No. 3 Auburn in Auburn, Ala. Saturday marks the Aggies' first matchup against a top-10 opponent since that triumph and Allen said he will push to keep the team's mental edge sharp.\"A top-10 matchup, you're going to have emotions running wild,\" Allen said. \"But as a team, I think we're really good at controlling those. We keep our emotions in check but we still have the energy there.\"The A&M offense will need that when facing an Alabama team that ranks sixth nationally in total defense (264.5 yards per game) and fourth against the run (77.3 average). But the pregame focus falls on an A&M defense that ranks 11th among the 14 SEC teams in yards allowed (374.8 per game) after being the league cellar-dweller the past two seasons.\"We're not great but we've definitely improved,\" coach Kevin Sumlin said.Defensive end Myles Garrett, a sophomore from Arlington Martin who leads the team in sacks (7.5) and tackles for losses (9.5), welcomes the chance for the Aggies to test their defensive mettle against a top-10 opponent in an emotion-charged setting.\"We've said we're improved on defense and this is our chance to prove it,\" Garrett said. \"So we've got to go out there and do it. Emotions shouldn't do anything but increase our level of play and how well we execute.\"Emotions certainly will be high for first-year defensive coordinator John Chavis, a longtime assistant at multiple SEC schools. Asked if he felt an extra buzz when scheming to stop the Crimson Tide, Chavis said: \"Yeah. I hate to admit it, but probably so. You look at their stature. This is a big game for Texas A&M. You've got a chance to go and compete against one of the best teams in the league. If that doesn't get you excited as a coach and a player, there's something missing.\"For A&M, the biggest thing missing on their SEC ledger is a victory in Kyle Field over a high-profile league rival. Saturday offers the next opportunity to change that.Â©2015 Fort Worth Star-TelegramVisit the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at www.star-telegram.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:24:05.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
