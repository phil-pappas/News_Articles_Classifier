The sophomore forward came off the bench to score the winning goal in a 3-1 victory over Truett-McConnell and added another in a 4-2 win over Tennessee Wesleyan.Much like in the men’s game, the Lady Eagles (9-1-1, 4-1) also needed a comeback to beat Tennessee Wesleyan. Trailing 2-1 with 20 minutes to play, Reinhardt rallied to score three goals in a 15-minute stretch.Megan McCall started the comeback, scoring her second goal of the game in the 71st minute. Lindsey White added the go-ahead goal in the 82nd minute, and Goodrich put the game out of reach with her score in the 85th minute.Both teams will be back in action today, with the women visiting Georgia Gwinnett and the men traveling to Barbourville, Kentucky, to face No. 16 Union.♦ ♦ ♦Liam Byrne threw for 345 yards, ran for 3, had 15 yards receiving and accounted for four total touchdowns as Woodstock’s offensive player of the week in a 37-22 win over Cherokee.
