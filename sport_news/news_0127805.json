Then their outside set was so fast, our middles couldn't get there. Then, their outsides can just jump out of the gym and put the ball straight down.\" \nHar-Ber had plenty of breathing room in the first and third sets, but had to fight back from an early 8-1 deficit to take the second. The Lady Wildcats scored five out of the last six points in that set for the win keyed by aces from Bailey Baxendale and Jaden Willliams. \nSchisler loved the way her team focused on defense that fed the Har-Ber attack. \n\"I want my teams to be gritty and to go the wall for every ball,\" Schisler said. \"I thought our defense played a lot better tonight. We didn't rely on one person to dig the ball. Everyone did their job. That's important for us and our serve receive was better, too. \n\"When a game gets tight, a lot of times those things tighten up. I thought in game two we stayed loose and did a good job.\" \nJunior libero Emily Doss led the Har-Ber defense with a match-high 23 digs. Setter Elizabeth Williams contributed 35 assists and two blocks. Emily Thompson also added three solo blocks. \nSenior Elleson Dunagin led Heritage (16-9-1, 5-7) with 14 kills and 13 digs, while senior libero Alye Darter had 21 digs. Senior setter Lindsay Glynn contributed 24 assists and 11 digs, while middle Regan Turner chipped in five blocks. \nSports on 10/14/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:04:11.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
