Who is bad? Transitive property to the rescue \nPosted 9:05 a.m. today Your friends e-mail addresses (comma separated): * Subject: * You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters More on this Ace in Atlanta brightens Coastal outlook for Fedora, Heels By Lauren Brownlow \nHow can you begin to tell which teams are good and bad when Ohio State can’t put away NIU or Indiana, Michigan State struggles with stinky Purdue and Baylor hasn’t played anyone? TCU kind of has, so they might be good. Northwestern seems good, but they looked like garbage in a win over Bowling Green. \nStanford might be good, but they looked like garbage against Northwestern in a loss. Clemson looks pretty darned good, but boy do they make it difficult on themselves. Alabama looks like…well, Alabama. But even they have a loss. Notre Dame seems impressive each week until their opponents over the previous weeks play more games. Then less so. \nSo when we don’t really know who is good, and all three Triangle games have the same record, how do we settle this? \nWith the power of transitive. And all three area teams could use a little help from their opponents, who are not carrying their weight. \nNC STATE Opponent record in all other games not vs. NC State: 9-9, 3-9 FBS, 0-5 Power 5 Future opponent record: 22-10, 14-10 FBS, 8-9 Power 5 \nTroy (1-3, 0-3 FBS) : NC State opened the year winning 49-21 against Troy in a score that was closer than the game itself. Troy then beat Charleston Southern 44-16 before losing 28-3 at Wisconsin and 24-18 at home to one of NC State’s other non-conference opponents, South Alabama. But NC State does have the most points scored against Troy this year by far. \nEastern Kentucky (2-2, 0-2 FBS) : The Colonels are an FCS team, but a pretty good one – this is the same team that nearly knocked off Kentucky at Kentucky last weekend (losing 34-27). Eastern Kentucky has wins over Valparaiso and Austin Peay by a combined score of 103-23. This is the best FCS win of the Triangle teams. \nOld Dominion (2-3, 1-3 FBS) : The Monarchs began the year 2-0 with wins over Eastern Michigan and Norfolk State. (How bad is Norfolk State? IT LOST TO RUTGERS BY 50. RUTGERS COULDN’T BEAT A COMPETENT TEAM BY 50 IF THEY TRIED, FCS OR NO.) After losing 38-14 to NC State at home in probably its best game of the year, Old Dominion has since lost 49-0 to Appalachian State (3-1) at home and then 27-7 at Marshall (4-1). So that means Appalachian State would beat NC State because transitive. \nSouth Alabama (3-2, 2-2 FBS) : USA beat Gardner-Webb (1-3) to begin the year, then lost 48-9 at Nebraska (2-3). A Nebraska team that just lost to Illinois. Then the Jaguars raised some eyebrows by winning at San Diego State (2-3) the week before NC State. But it turns out San Diego State might be bad. USA’s third win is over a team NC State also beat – Troy. Verdict? Meh. \nLouisville (2-3, 1-3 FBS) : I rolled my eyes at the notion that Louisville was more battle-tested than NC State simply because of its much tougher opening schedule. Mostly because they looked like a mess on offense and defense. But Louisville did open the year with three one-score losses to teams with a combined record of 11-2, and Auburn – preseason No. 6 – is the one dragging that group down (3-2). \nBest transitive win: South Alabama > San Diego State \nBest transitive moral victory: Eastern Kentucky L 34-27 @ Kentucky \nWorst transitive loss: Houston > Louisville (that’s according to FPI rankings, which still have Auburn at 35, a spot below 5-0 Northwestern, so okay then, agree to disagree, advanced metrics) \nNORTH CAROLINA Opponent record in all other games not vs. North Carolina: 12-7, 4-5 FBS, 1-5 Power 5 Future opponent record: 19-13, 12-13 FBS, 5-10 Power 5 \nSouth Carolina (2-3, 2-3 FBS) : I said it at the time that North Carolina would regret derping this game away. South Carolina lost 26-22 to Kentucky at home, was housed 52-20 by Georgia (who was housed by Alabama last week) and then beat UCF 31-14. UCF has no wins and is awful. Then they lost 24-10 at a Missouri team that couldn’t even put up more than 10 on UConn at home. Gross. Transitively, this loss makes UNC terrible. \nNorth Carolina A&T (3-1, 0-1 FBS) : After pounding Shaw 61-7 in the opener, they lost 53-14 at UNC and proceeded to beat a bad Elon team just 14-7 before winning 45-31 at Hampton. I have no idea if that’s good but clearly A&T is road-tested. Big game in Triangle-area transitive on Saturday as they travel to Norfolk State, a team that one of NC State’s non-conference opponents (ODU) beat earlier this year. \nIllinois (4-1, 3-1 FBS) : Illinois has the only win by a UNC opponent so far over a Power 5 team, edging Nebraska 14-13 last week. The Illini won their first two games against Kent State and Western Illinois by a combined score of 96-3, but then looked…underwhelming in a 48-14 loss at UNC. They edged Middle Tennessee 27-25 before getting that big win at home over Nebraska. So maybe Illinois is like….not a dumpster fire? By Big 10 standards anyway. \nDelaware (2-3, 0-1 FBS) : Delaware (of the FCS ranks) looked pretty gross in its first two games, losing 20-14 to Jacksonville (not the Jacksonville State that almost beat Auburn) and then won 19-9 over Lafayette before losing a 28-21 heartbreaker to Villanova. Delaware looked really good at times against North Carolina in a 41-14 win that was a one-score game in the second half, but maybe UNC was actually spending all that time preparing for Georgia Tech. Either way, a very meh win for transitive purposes. \nGeorgia Tech (2-3, 1-3 FBS) : This feels like UNC’s best win. Last year’s Coastal/Orange Bowl champs! Maybe it will be…but not right now, going on solely this year. Georgia Tech is 1-4 against FBS opponents with the lone win coming against Tulane. The Jackets fought hard to cut the Notre Dame game to eight points but fell 30-22, then lost 34-20 at Duke and blew a 21-0 lead to UNC. Right now, the power of this win for transitive purposes is in name and reputation only. And preseason expectations. Which, thanks a lot, Georgia Tech, for making me look like an idiot. (I don’t need any help.) \nBest transitive win: Illinois over Nebraska, 14-13 \nBest transitive moral victory: Georgia Tech L 30-22 at Notre Dame \nWorst transitive loss (tie): South Carolina (losses to Kentucky and Missouri) \nDUKE Opponent record in all other games not against Duke: 12-6, 6-5 FBS, 2-4 Power 5 Future opponent record: 16-16, 9-15 FBS, 5-10 Power 5 \nTulane (2-2, 1-2 FBS) : Well, Tulane lost 37-7 to Duke at home to open 2015 and then lost 65-10 to hand Georgia Tech its only FBS win to date. Then the Green Wave lapped gently over FCS Maine, 38-7, and beat a winless UCF team 45-31 at home. So Tulane is just lukewarm garbage. \nNorth Carolina Central (1-3, 0-2 FBS) : The Eagles pounded St. Augustine’s 72-0 in the season opener and it’s been all downhill from there. The Eagles lost its best player Mike Jones, which was brutal, and it’s shown in the results – they had him for the 55-0 loss to Duke, but they didn’t for the 39-14 loss at FIU or the heartbreaking 28-26 loss to Bethune-Cookman. \nNorthwestern (5-0, 4-0 FBS) : I’ll admit, Northwestern’s early results underwhelmed me, even with the 16-6 win over Stanford. Their performance at Duke was complete and thorough, though, and they followed that up with a 24-19 win over Ball State and a dominant 27-0 win over Minnesota. Doubt the Wildcats at your own peril. Certainly the best loss for a Triangle team this year and it’s not close. \nGeorgia Tech (2-3, 1-3 FBS) : Georgia Tech’s early schedule has been pretty tough, but it’s not going to get much easier. So just like with North Carolina, Duke’s transitive record might not get bolstered too much by this win, sadly. \nBoston College (3-2, 1-2 FBS) : BC is offensively challenged. That defense, though, is legit. It’s had to do too much as the offense has mustered just 21 points in three games against FBS opponents and seven against its two Power 5 opponents (FSU and Duke). Boston College has no good transitive wins or moral victories to speak of right now. Just a bunch of dudes. \nBest transitive win: Boston College > NIU \nBest transitive moral victory: Georgia Tech L @ Notre Dame, 30-22; Duke > Boston College > NIU L @ Ohio State, \nWorst transitive loss: N/A (Northwestern, the only team to beat Duke, is undefeated) Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:21:14.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
