State’s Dak Prescott was jumped while enjoying his Spring Break in Panama City, only to be matched by Drew Barker fighting Patrick Grafree’s fist with his jaw in Richmond soon after. \nThe two quarterbacks were blindsided by cowards, so this one is a push. \nHOTTEST FAN Kindly vs. Stingray \nThough they likely have a similar bra size, Kindly is the winner in this contest and it’s not even close. I’ll take Kindly against anyone here. \nThis does not change my appreciation of Stingray, however. The guy is a star. I just have no interest in seeing him in a bikini. \nFALL FUN! Keeneland vs. Vardaman Sweet Potato Festival \nAs a regular at Keeneland’s fall meets and a one-time Vardaman Sweet Potato Festival attendee, I can say with the 100 percent confidence that Keeneland is the better of the two. While the old ladies of Vardaman look good in their cross-stitch sweaters, nothing compares to the scene on a Saturday afternoon at Keeneland. \nGive me the bourbon and horses over the sweet potatoes all day. \nRESTAURANT Tolly Ho vs. Beef O’Brady’s, Starkville \nTolly Ho was named one of the Best Drunk Eats In America by Buzzfeed earlier today and you’ll have a hard time finding anyone who disagrees. The Beef O’Brady’s in Starkville, on the other hand, is your typical Beef O’Brady’s. It’s nothing special. Lukewarm wings and celery and soggy fried pickles and stuff. \nWinner: Tolly Ho \nDisclaimer: I have no idea if people eat at the Beef O’Brady’s in Starkville, but I assume everyone eats at the Beef O’Brady’s in Starkville. Starkville seems like a very Beef O’Brady’s type of town. I bet it stays packed. \nNot Living In Starkville vs. Living In Starkville \n\nAnd in the most important category of them all, Not Living In Starkville takes the crown over Living In Starkville. If you live anywhere not named Starkville, you are winning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:58:02.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
