Washington beat a ranked team for the first time under second-year coach Chris Petersen. \nCody Kessler had two interceptions while passing for just 156 yards on a disastrous night for the Trojans (3-2, 1-2), the popular preseason pick to win the conference. \nInstead, USC couldn't score a touchdown until Ronald Jones II's short run with 12:02 to play.
