But I'll tell you who I think is the most important player for the game and that's Matt Elam. \nYou may remember Matt as a recruit. He was a kid from Hardin County that was ranked as one of the best players in America. Kentucky had to beat out Alabama to get him. He's on the defensive line and since hes come to UK hes struggled with weight issues. \nHes never really had a chance to play a ton and the reason is hes been behind Melvin Lewis, one of the best players on the team. Well Melvin broke his leg and now it's Matt Elam's time. It's interesting for Mark Stoops that if you're looking at ratings, Matt Elam was probably the highest rated recruit hes brought in. A lot of people in this state have waited to see what he can do. \nNow is the time for Matt to step up. He gets a chance to play against a top notch SEC team and make an impact. There's no ability now for him to rest on someone else's talent. Hes got to do it. Hes got to be in shape and hes got to make the plays. \nFor Kentucky to be good the rest of the season, he has to play a major role. It's Matt Elam's time and it's up to Matt to see if he can perform.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:38:18.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
