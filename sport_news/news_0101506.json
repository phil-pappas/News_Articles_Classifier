Louisville improved 3-4 and 2-2.\n“We are up against it because we need seven this year, we don’t need six,” said BC coach Steve Addazio. “But my focus right now is to try to shore up where all the leaks are right now, and they keep coming.”\nThe Eagles lost their second quarterback this season when freshman Jeff Smith was crushed on an 8-yard touchdown run with 2:55 to play in the third quarter. Addazio did not know the extent of Smith’s head injury but hinted he might not practice for next Saturday’s home clash with Virginia Tech.\nBC began the season with sophomore Darius Wade under center. Wade fractured his ankle in a loss to Florida State on Sept. 18.\nRedshirt freshman Troy Flutie finished the game at quarterback and completed 4-of-11 passes for 46 yards. Flutie started three games after Wade’s injury and feels confident he can command the offense against the Hokies.\n“I’ve been working hard this week and thought I could do it, but some plays didn’t go our way and I missed some passes,” said Flutie. “I’ve been in there and I’ve played enough. If I end up playing (against Virginia Tech) — and I have no idea what’s going on yet — I think with a good week of practice, I’ll be ready.”\nBC’s floundering offense took its worst hit of the season. The Eagles were held to 79 total yards, with minus-14 rushing yards, four first downs and gave up eight sacks and 14 tackles for a loss. Addazio was frustrated by the way his young offensive line repeatedly lost one-on-one battles and exposed both quarterbacks to unrelenting pressure.\nThe Eagles’ problems were accentuated with minor injuries to tailbacks Tyler Rouse and Marcus Outlow. Myles Willis (22 yards) carried the load in the second half despite a tender shoulder. BC has been without featured tailback Jon Hilliman since he was injured on Sept. 26.\nThe Eagles defense and special teams kept BC in the game to the end. The Eagles forced four turnovers, recorded seven sacks, 16 tackles for a loss and gave up 365 yards of total offense. Most of the Cardinals yards were on big gains. BC scored on a blocked punt that was returned for a touchdown by Elijah Robinson in the second quarter.\n“Obviously disappointing because our kids battled but to give up eight sacks and an unaccounted number of negative plays was . . .” said Addazio. “There was effort all over the field but eight sacks, I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before.”\nSmith’s demise began with a Louisville fumble that gave the Eagles first-and-goal on the Cardinals’ 6-yard line with 3:33 to play in the third.\nDefensive tackle Connor Wujciak stripped tailback Jeremy Smith on the 40 and it was returned 34 yards by end Harold Landry. On second-and-8, Smith swept right but was hit hard at the goal line by Louisville strong safety Josh Harvey-Clemons. Mike Knoll made the extra point to cut the lead to 17-14.\n“That was a roll out and we tried to roll out as much as we could to get away from the pressure and there was a lot of field there for (Smith),” said Addazio. “He got the corner and we were able to score there and that’s when he got knocked out.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Bad+to+worse+for+BC", "http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url="], "published": "2015-10-25T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:24:26.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
