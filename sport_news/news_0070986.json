Hopefully we'll find some more performance in the USA.\n\"The car performed quite well in the race and we seemed to take care of the tyres more than the others. I'm happy with the weekend.\"\nAlonso's penalty promoted Dutch teenager Max Verstappen of Toro Rosso to 10th place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:45:17.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
