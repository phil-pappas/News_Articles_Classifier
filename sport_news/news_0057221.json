Up by a score of 23-21 with 10 seconds remaining, U-M botched a punt on its own side of the field that was returned by MSU for a touchdown as time expired.\nIn a matter of seconds, the Big House crowd of over 111,000 went from euphoria to agony, while Spartans fans witnessed a magical outcome that preserved their undefeated season.\nAfter a few days to regroup, the Michigan fanbase is still in shock after somehow losing a game in which its team led for 59 minutes, 50 seconds. This one painfully ranks right up there with Colorado in 1994 and Appalachian State in 2007.\nBut the big picture is a whole lot brighter for the Wolverines.\nNobody is going to chalk this one up as a moral victory, but U-M backed up the hype for the most part on Saturday.\nIf anyone followed the box score during the game without seeing the score, it would have been logical to assume that the Spartans had led throughout. Connor Cook showed the NFL hype surrounding him was legitimate and MSU's defense did a nice job of limiting what Michigan could do offensively.\nThough, there Jim Harbaugh's Wolverines were. Special teams was the clear advantage for U-M and that's what helped them lead through most of the game.\nBlake O'Neill will go down in Michigan football history as the guy who messed up, but he was spectacular on Saturday, nailing an 80-yard punt and pinning the Spartans back deep often. He, along with returner Jabrill Peppers, helped the Wolverines flip the field and put the team is positions to succeed.\nHarbaugh said after the game that Michigan played \"winning football\" and did not get the result. While normally that could be filed under the coach speak, that statement rings true in terms of the game.\nWith the win at the Big House, MSU has now won seven of the last eight in the series.\nHowever, Michigan is no longer the doormat in this rivalry. In a lot of ways, the game on Saturday parallels Mark Dantonio's first game in this rivalry. The home team was up by two scores in the fourth quarter only to have victory snatched away from them in dramatic fashion.\nThat game was the one that turned the tide in this entire rivalry, which was stamped by Mike Hart's \"Little Brother\" comments. Since then, MSU has become a national power and used that statement as a rallying cry for the program.\nThis year's edition featured a bit of that drama as well, though not quite as covered and overblown.\nFollowing the conclusion, there was no postgame handshake between Harbaugh and Dantonio. It was a unique circumstance where a player was injured in the end zone following a wild walk-off victory, but it still never took place.\nThere is also video of Dantonio yelling, \"Where did all the Wolverines go?\" as he ran off the field and through the Michigan Stadium tunnel.\nDo not expect that to go over lightly in the Michigan locker room.\nAt the end of the day, it was a great game played by two very good football teams with conference title implications on the line, and that's likely what will be at stake from here on out when these two teams play year in and year out.", "external_links": ["http://mailto:abroome1110@gmail.com/", "http://www.maizenbrew.com/"], "published": "2015-10-19T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:47:59.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
