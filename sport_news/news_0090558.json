The men’s team will be introduced at 10:15 and the event will include both teams scrimmaging and the raising of the Final Four banner that Izzo’s team earned last season. \nAs usual, the most anticipated sight will be Izzo as … something. \n“I don’t know why I keep doing it – part (MSU athletic director Mark) Hollis, part our incredible marketing department, part the fun of being able to make a fool of yourself and laugh at yourself … It really is a fun night,” Izzo said. “You get to enjoy it with young kids that don’t normally get to see the game. That’s the cool part of Midnight Madness for me, a lot of people that don’t get to enjoy the games during the year get to come and with their parents.” Where was Izzo? In the Big House tunnel, of course \nFans can enter at gates A, B, C and D. Because there’s an MSU hockey game Friday night at Munn Arena, parking is $5 before 7:15 p.m. and free after that where available. There will be a shuttle from the Communication Arts and Sciences parking ramp at the corner of Red Cedar and Trowbridge roads starting at 7:30. \nThe first 4,500 fans will receive a free Final Four 2015 seat cushion. Izzo will be signing autographs across from section 108 and Merchant will be across from section 129, with their players spread out around the concourse.
