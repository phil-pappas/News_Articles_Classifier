From the fact that the 6-foot-4, 300-pound McCoy leads all defensive tackles in sacks since 2012 with 26, to his contract. \nIt’s a whopper. \nThe 27-year-old McCoy signed a six-year, $95.2-million extension with $51.5 million guaranteed last year. He’s the sixth-highest-paid defender in the league. \nBeadles went against McCoy in 2012 while he was playing for Denver. Beadles, who made the Pro Bowl that season, also saw McCoy last preseason. McCoy played 13 snaps in the opener on Aug. 8 at EverBank Field, recording a tackle behind the line and a quarterback hit. \nThe Jaguars are struggling to score points. The last thing they need is for McCoy to be coming straight at quarterback Blake Bortles consistently. \n“As far as an interior defensive lineman, he’s definitely one of the best in the league,” Beadles said. “He’s just a complete player: strong, quick, plays with good pad level and is good with his hands. He has a multitude of moves that he uses. That’s the biggest thing is he has so much he can do to you.” \nThe Jaguars faced arguably the best defensive tackle earlier this season in Miami’s Ndamukong Suh. That went well for the Jaguars. Not only did they win 23-20 on Sept. 20, but Suh was a non-factor registering one tackle, which wasn’t behind the line. \nThat would seem to bode well for the Jaguars, except for two huge factors. \nSuh has struggled to fit in with the Dolphins, who have already fired their coach and defensive coordinator. \nMost importantly for the Jaguars, right guard Brandon Linder is out for the season with a shoulder injury. \nJaguars rookie offensive guard A.J. Cann got a taste of life in the NFL last week in his first start. \nCann replaced Linder in a 16-13 overtime loss to Indianapolis. \nNow, the third-round pick’s task greatly increases. Cann has only focused solely at right guard for a couple of weeks, having started training camp out on the left side. \n“McCoy is probably one of the best in the game,” Cann said. “He can be powerful, athletic and has a heck of a get off. It’s probably the best I’ve seen of any NFL guy. His ability to read snaps is really good and it messes up the protections, because his penetration is so good coming off the ball. We’ve got to put a hat on a hat, wherever he’s at.” \nAh, there’s the key issue for the Jaguars — locating McCoy. \n“What they do maybe different than some is at times he has a three-way go,” Jaguars coach Gus Bradley said. “He can slide inside, stay outside or come into you. So there are different things that he does that they keep him on the move at times. That makes it even more of a challenge. … He’s lined up on the edge too and you’re seeing him there, so that poses a problem or issue as well.” \nCenter Stefen Wisniewski will be largely responsible for identifying where McCoy is and dictating the blocking. Like Beadles, the former Oakland Raider went against McCoy in 2012. \nWisniewski said McCoy and Suh are similar players, but that McCoy “might be a little stronger” than Suh. \n“It’s tough, because you don’t know where he’s going to line up,” Wisniewski said. “You can’t call your plays accordingly, so you adjust as you’re going based on where he is. Most of that comes down to the center. I’ll be aware of where he is and plan things accordingly. We have a specific plan for him.” \nMcCoy has been selected to the Pro Bowl in each of the last three seasons and already has three sacks this year. A shoulder injury limited him in practice this week, but he's listed as questionable and is expected to play. \nMcCoy was well versed on the Jaguars when asked about them earlier this week. \n“They’ve got a vet in Beadles and a rookie guard,” McCoy said. “I think [Cann] held his own last week in Indy. I honestly think he was on the left side, I believe, before they moved him into right guard. To play like he did — no penalties — I think he played pretty well. The center, we brought him in here on a visit, so obviously he’s got some skill to him. He’s a vet. I think that those three guys in the middle, they can do a good job for Bortles.” \nThe Jaguars seem close to hitting their offensive stride. They gained 431 yards against the Colts last week, but only managed 13 points. \nYardage totals like that are usually rewarded more on the scoreboard, but that’s been a consistent theme. The Jaguars are 18th in total offense in terms of yardage, but rank 31st in scoring. \nFinding the end zone consistently against the Buccaneers will mean keeping McCoy in check. \n“The bottom line is you have to line up knowing you’re going to be matched up one on one at times,” Beadles said. “And you have to win more of those than you lose.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:46:03.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
