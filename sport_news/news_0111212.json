It was his fifth straight game with more than 300 passing yards and multiple touchdown passes.\nWith Lynch at the helm, Memphis' offense reeled off 31 unanswered points to turn a double-digit deficit against Ole Miss into a double-digit lead.\n\"He's very calm. He has no pressure,\" wide receiver Mose Frazier said of Lynch. \"Paxton's done a great job leading this team.\"\nLynch, a Deltona, Florida, native, is one of five active AAC players to have received three or more weekly conference awards. Memphis kicker Jake Elliott leads all AAC players with five career weekly awards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:35:13.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
