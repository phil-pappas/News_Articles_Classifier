That can be at the bottom or the top. \n\"At the present moment, we just have to get over that hump and once we do, we have got the talent and ability - we have shown that - that we will win games.\" \nNewcastle's season has not been all doom and gloom - they played well to draw 2-2 with Chelsea after leading 2-0 on September 26 and reached half-time at Manchester City a week later at 1-1 before succumbing to a Sergio Aguero blitz which saw them lose 6-1. \nMcClaren is desperate not to pile any added pressure on to his under-performing players as they attempt to end their wait for a league victory against the Canaries, and is simply demanding a 95-minute performance from them. \nHe said: \"If you say, 'It's a must-win', that's a lot of stress, anxiety, over-arousal, under-performance, and we want a performance, so the pressure is to fight for 95 minutes. \n\"That's the pressure, that's the pressure from the fans and everybody at this football club, the pressure to be disciplined and do your job and the pressure to play football. \n\"That's the pressure that we put on the players, and that's every week. If we get that pressure in, we handle it and we perform, we will win football matches.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:10:48.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
