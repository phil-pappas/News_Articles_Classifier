(AP) - New Hampshire's universities and community colleges say the safety of students, faculty and staff is paramount and that officials constantly review security and emergency response plans.\nThe state's four university campuses design and review their own emergency response plan to a shooting. The seven community colleges customize their plans based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security template. Both systems said the plans are regularly checked.\nThe emergency plans include how to prevent situations from escalating, intervening with people who might be at risk of turning violent, notifying people in case of an incident. They also spell out what the law enforcement response should look like.\nAt Keene State College, for example, incoming students are taught how to identify possibly dangerous behavior and what to do in case a shooting takes place.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
