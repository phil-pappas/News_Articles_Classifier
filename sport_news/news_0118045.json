(Photo: Kirthmon F. Dozier DFP) Buy Photo \nA week later and nothing has changed. \nMichigan fans still are steaming. Michigan State fans still are starry-eyed. \nThose stunning final 10 seconds in Ann Arbor last Saturday won't be forgotten soon. There was one Spartans fan I encountered in a grocery store this week who downloaded the ESPN audio of the Michigan botched punt and Michigan State recovery touchdown as his cell-phone ringtone. \nBut the true legacy of that game will be defined by the strength and character of the principals of that dramatic moment. Michigan punter Blake O'Neill and Michigan State special-teams player Jalen Watts-Jackson are interminably linked. O'Neill's folly became Watts-Jackson's fortune when he grabbed the loose ball and rambled 38 yards for the game-winning touchdown with no time remaining. \nBut both exhibited tremendous perseverance through their respective pain in the immediate days following that frantic finish. How they handled their respective adversities not only made their institutions proud, but both might have accomplished the unthinkable — bringing the fan bases together in agreement that these young men are the examples for which college football should strive. And both programs do a pretty good job of producing such examples. \nWatts-Jackson vowed that he'll play again after surgery to repair a broken hip, the injury he suffered at the end of his dramatic touchdown run. Hopefully, he can play again. But it's always iffy when you're dealing with hip injuries. Yet, knowing the long, uncertain road he faces going forward — the young man said he wouldn't have traded a thing. \nO'Neill endured boorish social-media comments straight from the stable-room floor in the aftermath of his blunder. But he stood tall before reporters three days later, assuring all that he was fine and ready to happily move forward with his career. He could have hidden. Most of us would have in the aftermath of such a gut-wrenching defeat. \nThe emotions remain raw between the rivals. But amid the mutual name-calling and belittling of the other's achievements, there might emerge a reciprocated appreciation of both programs doing what matters most in the larger context. Developing tough-minded young men with strong character. Staff picks: Michigan State gets to 8-0, but it won't be easy \n■ A botched punt of picks: A 20-17 record overall (4-2 last week against the point spread) for the all-seeing, all-knowing, famed seer, sage, soothsayer and former chief mathematician for Michigan football special teams … The Great Boodini. \nIndiana (plus-16 1 / 2 ) at Michigan State: Hoping to prove that last week's thrilling finish wasn't a miracle but rather standard operating procedure, coach Mark Dantonio vociferously complains to the referee that the Hoosiers get flagged for lining up more than eight blockers against the Spartans' 11 on a punt in the final minute. The Big Ten strongly reprimands Indiana for such a blatant violation of league protocol. Pick — Indiana. \nOhio State (minus-21) at Rutgers: It's learned that Urban Meyer's decision to make J.T. Barrett the No. 1-ranked Buckeyes' starting quarterback came only when an errant football came flying through Meyer's office window this week. It was later revealed that it was one of Cardale Jones' moon-launch passes from last week's game that finally came down to earth. \nPick — Ohio State. \nWisconsin (minus-6 1 / 2 ) at Illinois: It's homecoming for the Illini, and they're honoring the occasion by wearing replicas of the uniform Red Grange wore during his heyday more than 90 years ago. It also marked the last time anybody actually cared about Illinois football. \nPick — Wisconsin. \nPenn State (minus-6 1 / 2 ) at Maryland: Considering his inability to stay upright due to Penn State's atrocious offensive line, quarterback Christian Hackenburg officially has his surname changed in the game program to \"Sackenburg.\" Pick — Penn State. \nNorthwestern (plus-7 1 / 2 ) at Nebraska: Pick — Nebraska. \nContact Drew Sharp: dsharp@freepress.com.
