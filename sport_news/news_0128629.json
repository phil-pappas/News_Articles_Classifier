Buy Now Tyler Dahlgren \nFort Calhoun's Taylor Marshall receives a Conestoga serve during the early stages of a thrilling 31-29 Pioneer win in the first set on Tuesday night. \nFort Calhoun was on the offensive Tuesday night, and after prevailing in a back-and-forth marathon of a first set, there was little slowing the Pioneers down. \nThe result was a 31-29, 25-23, 25-22 sweep of Conestoga on the road in an enthused environment to snap a two-game slide. Prevailing in the thrilling first set, in which Conestoga got within a point of winning on two separate occasions, the momentum permanently swung in the Pioneers' favor. \n“Getting that first win after being down 8-3 was a huge advantage going into the night,” head coach James Slie said. “Momentum quickly changed and the girls fought all night long to keep ownership of the match.” \nThe two sets that followed were equally as competitive, but Conestoga wasn't able to keep up with the Pioneers, who finished with 99 attempts at hitting the ball in the sweep. The Pioneers' passing precision created opportunities at the net. Opportunities that players like Grace Whitlaw and Rylee Marshall capitalized on. \n“Grace played the best volleyball she has played in a while,” Slie said of his senior, who recently committed to Briar Cliff University. “Her passing and defense was on point and her decision-making skills at the net were spot on. She was able to put the ball down when needed and find holes in the defense throughout all three games.” \nWhitlaw finished with 15 kills, including seven in the crucial opening set. Marshall was just as destructive to Conestoga's defense, leading the way with 23 kills. She was set 39 times, and Slie said the sophomore was unstoppable on Tuesday night. \n“She's a threat any time we pass the ball,” Slie said. \nAshlyn Dipple and Taylor Marshall each finished the match with three aces, while Sarah Johnson, Marshall and Skylar Wear each added one. Whitlaw received 12 Conestoga serves, while senior Dacey Boudle successfully handled 25 and led the way with seven digs. \nThe Pioneers will have a week off before hosting Arlington on Tuesday night. The Eagles have won 10 out of 11 games and have boosted their record to 17-7. \nSlie is still searching for consistency from his Pioneers, now 12-14 on the season, but believes the team that showed up Tuesday night is capable of finishing the season strong. \n“The girls, at times, are hungry to win and when they show up with that mindset, they are a tough team mentally and physically on the court.” \nFort Calhoun 3 Conestoga 0 \nFort Calhoun (12-14) 31 25 25 3 \nConestoga (12-14) 29 23 22 0 ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:20:20.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
