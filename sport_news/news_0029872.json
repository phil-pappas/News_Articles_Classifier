The day he’d been waiting for. His first official practice at the collegiate level. \n“I always wanted to play college ball, and now it’s here,” said Lamb, a freshman swingman who starts at Marist with a unique background that includes two surgeries to repair torn anterior cruciate ligaments. \nNonetheless, he was prepared and in top shape, running up and down the floor. \n“I was ready to play.” Marist's Maker proud of who recruit Lamb is \nOn the first official day of a season in which the Red Foxes will try to fill the void left by three four-year contributors, second-year head coach Mike Maker stressed the idea of veteran instruction to the younger players, as well as communication. The upperclassmen took heed and acted accordingly. \nMarist College's Kyle Daugherty, left, and Khallid Hart, right, scrimmage on Monday. (Photo: Alex H. Wagner/Poughkeepsie Journal) \nSenior forward Phillip Lawrence was asked by freshman swingman Ryan Funk which way to cut when he puts the ball into the offense. \n“I had to tell him he needs to enter from the left side,” Lawrence said. “That completes the offense and gets it flowing.” \nMarist's roster features seven freshmen and four sophomores. Redshirt junior guard Khallid Hart has embraced his veteran role, and recognizes that distributing knowledge is key. \n“(The freshman are) really great picking up directions and not messing up too many more times after that,” Hart said. “They’ve been asking us questions ever since the summer. We’ve been demonstrating it a few times before so they would understand what they were doing, and even after they finished, they’d come and ask more questions. \n“It’s good they want to know what they’re doing and how to fix it if they’re doing it wrong.” \nDirection by the team leaders was merely one idea the Red Foxes put into action. Before running a shooting and passing drill, Maker gathered his team under the basket. He attributed communication as a means for success, using the example of the Duke University men’s basketball team. \n“The great teams like Duke, they communicate all the time,” Lawrence said. “We’re getting the freshmen to talk too, so we can all be on the same page together.” \nMaker said team chemistry comes into play when teaching communication. He feels it’s going to be vital to his team’s success this season. \nMarist College's Kentrall Brooks, right, and Obi Momah, left, scrimmage on Monday (Photo: Alex H. Wagner/Poughkeepsie Journal) \n“There are a lot of different ways to lead. I think we have more guys, but fewer of them, who are more comfortable leading by example than they are vocally,” Maker said. \n“Verbal communication is very important to team harmony and also to execution, both offensively and defensively. We don’t talk nearly enough, and that’s going to be a point of emphasis.” \nReplacing Chavaughn Lewis, the program’s all-time leading scorer, is a feat Maker said will have to be done “collectively.” Marist also lost key contributors T.J. Curry and Manny Thomas to graduation. To accomplish that feat, Marist will boast a mixture of new faces like Lamb, Funk and Brian Parker, as well as an older crew like Lawrence, Hart and Eric Truog. \n“We’re taking a look at a lot of players,” Maker said. “It’s going to be an entirely new look for us.” \nA.J.
