Comment By Kevin J. Stone/Daily News Correspondent   By Kevin J. Stone/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 10:28 PM Updated at 10:37 PM By Kevin J. Stone/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 10:28 PM Updated at 10:37 PM ASHLAND â€” With just two weeks worth of games remaining before playoff seedings are determined, the Tri-Valley League Small division was clogged up heading into action on Friday night, and two of those teams in the thick of things were Ashland and Dover-Sherborn, who met at a soggy Ashland High School. Thanks to some stingy defense and timely scores, it was the Clockers handing the Raiders their first loss of the season, 21-7. With the win, the TVL Small remains crowded as Ashland moves to 4-1 overall and 1-1 in league play while Dover Sherborn falls to 4-1 overall and is now also 1-1 in TVL action. \"Our kids played really hard and our defensive line had a great game,\" said Ashland coach Andrew MacKay. \"That's a really good team with a few really good players. Obviously, they were undefeated coming into this game and our guys were ready for the challenge, we're very proud as a staff with the effort these guys had tonight.\" Leading 14-7 at the half, the Clocker defense was phenomenal in the third and fourth quarters. The Raiders had four possessions in the second half, but the Ashland defense forced a punt and three turnover-on-downs, including a big one with two minutes remaining. Following that, junior Colin Hanrahan had the only score of the second half, a 26-yard touchdown run with 1:34 left to make it 21-7. Both teams entered the game with strong defenses, and it showed throughout the game. Ashland entered having given up just 17.3 points per game while Dover-Sherborn entered even stronger, giving up only 13.3 points per game. It was the Clocker defense that outplayed the Raiders in the first half, leading to a seven-point lead for Ashland at halftime. The Clockers received the opening kick and wasted little time scoring first, driving 70 yards in just eight plays. Senior Shamus Reardon capped the drive with a 10-yard touchdown reception from quarterback and classmate Mitchell Porter with 7:03 left in the first quarter. It turned out to be the only score of the first 11 minutes, but Dover-Sherborn got on the board with 1:58 left before the half. After forcing an Ashland punt, D-S took over on its own 41-yard line with 7:25 left. Junior quarterback Eric Levine then led an impressive 11-play drive, capped off with a 7-yard touchdown run from senior John Hargreaves and Levine added the extra point. However, the Ashland offense quickly responded to give itself a lead heading into the break after starting at its own 19-yard line. From there, Porter led his team down to the D-S 38-yard line with 30 seconds before halftime. A long touchdown heave to senior Max Feinberg seemed to give Ashland the lead, but it was called back on offensive pass interference. Not to be discouraged, Ashland went right back to the same play, and completed it down to the 11-yard line with 17 seconds left. One play later, Hanrahan hauled in an 11-yard touchdown reception and the Clockers headed to the locker room with all the momentum. Page 2 of 2 - In a third quarter littered with clock problems and penalties, neither team scored and the only big play came when Ashland coughed up the football at the Dover-Sherborn 20-yard line with 6:28 left after driving from its own 35 in 11 plays, giving the Raiders some life. Ashland's defense decided it was going to be the Clockers' night though, grinding out the huge victory. \"This one feels great, but we've still got two more tough ones left too,\" acknowledged MacKay. \"The guys will enjoy this one tonight but we've still got plenty of work to do.\" By Kevin J.
