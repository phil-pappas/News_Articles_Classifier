New Mexico’s sack yardage (135) also leads the Mountain West.\nNational sack leaders\n1. Oklahoma State, 4.4 per game\n2. Pittsburgh, 4.25\n3. Penn State, 4.2\n4 (tie). Texas A&M, New Mexico, 3.8\nMountain West sack leaders\n1. New Mexico, 19\n2. Fresno State, 15\n3. (tie) Air Force, Boise State, 13\n5. Colorado State, 11 • • • • •\nSaturday\nNew Mexico at Nevada, 5 p.m. Mountain West Network (online), 770 AM\nIt must be noted that 13 of those sacks came against eminently stackable offenses: Mississippi Valley State (6) and New Mexico State (7).\nNonetheless, says UNM sophomore linebacker Kimmie Carson, the defensive pressure the Lobos are exerting is no mirage.\n“We’re in a more aggressive style (this year),” said Carson, who has 1½ of those 19 sacks and leads UNM in tackles overall with 38. “Our coaches always tell us to be the hammer and not the nail. We’re gonna bring it to ’em.\n“We don’t like to sit back and just be on our heels; we like to go get ’em. That’s what we’ve kind of been doing, and we’ve just got to build off of that.”\nWith seven games left on the schedule, the Lobos seem almost certain to surpass last season’s sack total of 24.\nJunior nickel safety Lee Crosby (just one sack for 7 yards, but a big one against New Mexico State) didn’t play last year, having sat out the season as a redshirt. But, having practiced with the defense throughout 2014 and having seen the games, he’s happy to be part of a far more disruptive unit in 2015.\n“It’s way more aggressive, ten times,” Crosby said of the defensive scheme. “Everybody’s finally starting to play for the team instead of for themselves. They know the talent that we’ve got, so everybody’s starting to play as one.”\nNevada (2-3, 0-1), the Lobos’ opponent Saturday in Reno, has allowed 10 sacks this season.\nDuring his Tuesday news conference, Nevada coach Brian Polian called the UNM defense “high pressure. Over 60 percent of the time you’re getting pressure from them.”\nA little recent sack history seems likely to be made this season.\nLast year’s season total of 24 sacks was the highest a UNM team has registered since 2006. The last time the Lobos led the Mountain West in that category — of course, there’s no guarantee the 2015 Lobos will do that, despite being the leaders in the clubhouse — was in 2004 with a total of 42.\nThe school record of 52, achieved by the 1982 team that went 10-1, appears safe. Nor is any Lobo likely to threaten Robin Cole’s 1975 individual season record of 17; linebackers Dakota Cox and Maurice Daniels share the current lead with 3½ apiece.\nNevertheless, Carson said, the UNM defense is aiming high.\n“No matter what kind of award (we get) or record we break, it’s gonna be history,” he said, referring not just to sacks but to the season as a whole. “… It’s real big to everybody just to make a name for ourselves here at UNM and get our names in the record books.”\nINJURY UPDATE: Regarding UNM’s defensive line, there’s bad news and good.\nSophomore defensive end Kene Okonkwo’s ankle injury suffered against New Mexico State involves torn ligaments, coach Bob Davie said. Okonkwo will be out from six to eight weeks.\nDavie said junior defensive end Nik D’Avanzo (hamstring), in whose place Okonkwo started against NMSU, should be ready to go Saturday at Nevada. Junior nose tackle William Udeh (knee) is expected to start after playing sparingly against the Aggies.\nSophomore defensive end Sam Mabany (ankle) will not play at Nevada, Davie said.\nNO TV: Saturday’s game at Nevada will not be televised, but will be digitally streamed at the Mountain West Network/Campus Insiders.\nThe Lobos have telecasts upcoming on ROOT Sports (Hawaii on Oct. 17, San Jose State on Oct. 24, Colorado State on Nov. 21); CBS Sports (Utah State on Nov. 7) and the ESPN family of networks (Boise State on Nov. 14, Air Force on Nov. 28).\nThe Boise State and Air Force games, if placed on ESPN or ESPN2, would trigger a $500,000 bonus for UNM. But both or either of those games also could be relegated to digital streaming on ESPN3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:31:51.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
