(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) Former UGA quarterback Matthew Stafford fined by NFL By Dave Birkett Detroit Free Press – published Friday, October 9, 2015 \nBlue shoes are apparently a no-no. \nDetroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford confirmed today that he was fined for wearing improper cleats in Monday night’s 13-10 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. \nStafford said he was fined “the generic random amount” for a uniform violation, which is $5,787 according to the NFL’s schedule of fines. \nStafford’s wife, Kelly, posted a text exchange with news of the fine on social media earlier this week, but quickly took down the post. \nStafford wore blue Nike cleats in Monday night’s game that he said were the same as ones that both Ndamukong Suh and Reggie Bush wore at times last year. He wore the same cleats in the preseason and was not fined for them then. \nStafford wore a different cleat for the Lions’ first three games, a metallic and blue color, but those shoes ripped in a Week 3 loss to the Denver Broncos. \nHe had the same blue shoes in his equipment bag for this week’s game against the Arizona Cardinals. \n“They’re going to the game again,” he said. \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
