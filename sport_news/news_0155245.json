The first will be held Saturday for Eric James, a 19-year-old Tuolumne County resident who is battling alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. James was born and raised in Tuolumne County and graduated from Soulsbyville Elementary and Summerville high schools. He finished his first year at Columbia College last spring while being diagnosed, at which time he began a 54-week chemotherapy/radiation treatment at Stanford Medical Center. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare cancer that forms in the body’s soft tissues, such as muscle and connective tissues. Saturday’s benefit will include a spaghetti dinner, silent auction and prize drawing at the Sonora Moose Lodge, 20921 Longeway Road, near Crystal Falls Drive. Dinner will be catered by Pinocchio’s Italian Cafe. Music will be provided by the Jank Tones. Tickets cost $10 per person or $30 for a family of four. The second event is the annual Share the Lane for Amy Wayne run on Oct. 11, which will benefit Chylee Miller, a Crystal Falls girl who has been battling leukemia since age 9. Event organizers have known Miller since her diagnosis and “we just felt led to support them in any way that we could, and this was a way to show our support,” said Becky Silva, one of the event’s organizers. Chylee, now 12, has made bracelets to hand out to younger participants. The event will also feature a raffle and music. Registration will begin at 7 a.m. at the Tuolumne Veterans Memorial Hall. A 10K will begin at 8 a.m., and a one-mile fun-run will begin at 8:30 a.m. An awards ceremony will begin at 10 a.m. The 10K costs $39 per person, and the one-mile fun run costs $25, if registration is done today. Both entry fees include a T-shirt. Cost to register for the 10K on the day of the event is $45, and a T-shirt is not guaranteed. Kids 10 and younger are free, and T-shirts can be purchased separately. To sign up or find out more information, go online to www.sharethelaneforamywayne.com. The event was created in memory of Amy Wayne, 27, of Sonora, who was running on Jamestown Road on Oct. 26, 2012, when she was struck by a vehicle and killed. The event aims to remind drivers to be aware of runners and all others sharing the road. To register today, go online to www.sharethelaneforamywayne.com.
