And this is the same attitude which Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar will be flaunting in his upcoming film Singh Is Bliing, where he sports different kinds of turbans. For Akshay, this is the second time after Singh Is Kinng that he would be playing up his attitude through the turban. Well, turbanators in Bollywood and Punjabi music and film industry are actually defining style statements. It is the different ways in which they tie a turban that make them stand apart, uniquely different from one another. While most of us have heard of the royal Patiala Shahi style, there are many more defining attitudes! The side story\nPopular singer-actor Ravinder Grewal has been known for his neatly seven pleated turban in the Malwaai style. “Now, the young guys prefer smaller turbans, which means 5 meter length. But many of us are going back to the Patiala Shahi style, which the royal lineage and the officers in the Army would sport.” The Patiala Shahi or the Royal Patiala turban was made popular by Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, and it is known to make the wearer look manly and handsome. “All the singers, be it Diljit, Gupreet, Ammy, wear their pagg in a particular style,” shares Simardeep Gill, another turban tieing expert who has worked with renowned actors, helping them get the right shape and style. You shouldn’t be surprised at the fact that turban styles stand as Nikku style (8.5 mt), Diljit style (6.5 mt), Patiala Shahi (7.5 mt) and NRI style (5.5 mt). “The others styles are Morni Dastar, Barnala Shahi Dastar, Watta Wali Dastar, Patiala Shahi Dastar and Amritsar Shahi Dastar. When it comes to what is in fashion, Simardeep zeroes in on the Morni Dastar. “The last larh is given a V- shape with a pin.” Turn to fame\nEarlier, Saif Ali Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Irrfan Khan and Ajay Devgn had sported turbans for their roles in films. But all had hired professionals that gave them a particular style. Lead singer of Faridkot, band Inderpreet Singh is known for the Bhagat Singh style turban. “One, it is 5 mt, two is tied in an untidy manner and third the last larh is suppose to be hanging. I have stuck to this style for four years now, and that defines my style.” As for singer-actor Ranjit Bawa, the Gurdaspuri pointed style is what he calls his signature style. “I like all bright colours, even though youngsters are moving to softer shades, I prefer maroons, blue, red, yellow.” jasmine@tribunemail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:22:28.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
