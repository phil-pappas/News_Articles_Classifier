Shortly after the 2014 season ended, hitting coach Bill Mueller resigned, and the Cubs replaced him with John Mallee. That happened before Maddon was hired in early November.\nWhen Maddon came in, he was able to hire his longtime bench coach and former Cubs player Dave Martinez.\nOn Wednesday, Maddon was asked specifically about pitching coach Chris Bosio, who worked under Renteria and his predecessor, Dale Sveum.\n\"I'll just say the whole coaching staff has done a great job,\" Maddon said. \"I think I've said that on numerous occasions. Every manager probably says the same thing about their coaching staff. These guys are good, and their prep is outstanding. The way they deliver the message to the players is right on. When we go into a game, we are ready for that game in all aspects of the game.\n\"To come into this situation and really only knowing Davey, to work out as well as it did is pretty interesting. It doesn't always happen often or easily where we all got on the same page.\"\nMissing Russell: The Cubs have played the National League championship series without starting shortstop Addison Russell, who injured his hamstring in Game 3 of the division series against the Cardinals.\nJavier Baez took over for Russell.\n\"Of course we miss Addison,\" Joe Maddon said. \"If you look at the record we had with him playing shortstop, and this is by no means negative toward Javy. Addison, with the combination of what he does for us defensively and offensively, this guy can drive in a critical run. Just understanding what's going on the field, he really grew quickly this year. Of course you miss him. Javy's doing fine.\"\nSwinging the bat: Mild-mannered closer Hector Rondon surprised a few people Tuesday night by taking a bat to the water fountain in the Cubs dugout. Apparently, he was upset about walking the Mets' David Wright in a scoreless ninth inning. Wright was the only baserunner Rondon allowed.\n\"I already went over to tell him he's out of the game and to congratulate him,\" Maddon said. \"He was fine. He picked up a bat, which I thought was curious. Then he went to the water fountain. I cleared out of the way because I didn't want to get any backswing. He nailed it, man. Solid contact.\"\nRecord-setting Schwarber: Rookie left fielder Kyle Schwarber entered Game 4 of the NLCS with 5 homers in the postseason, surpassing the franchise record for homers in a single postseason, 4 by both Alex Gonzalez and Aramis Ramirez in 2003.\nThe 5 homers were second most by a rookie in a single postseason. Tampa Bay's Evan Longoria had 6 in 2008. Schwarber is the only player in major-league history to hit at least 5 home runs before turning 23 years old.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
