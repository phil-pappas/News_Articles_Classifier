The big man came to the United States after an earthquake ravished his native Haiti in 2010 . He played for Reach Your Dream Prep, a team affiliated with Hamilton's nonprofit, after being ruled ineligible at two Memphis-area high schools. \nLabissiere has been practicing with the team. \nCoach John Calipari grew agitated with questions regarding Labissiere's eligibility at last week's SEC basketball media day. \n“Everything is good to go,” Calipari said before referring back to the school’s policy not to comment on a player’s eligibility until the first game. “There’s probably 50 players that have a review. Last year, we had five players have a review; a couple of them got cleared the week before the game. \n“Every year we’ve been here, players go through the review. You won’t believe this: It’s always the best players who go through the review. I think my team will be fine and you guys will figure it out when we go out the first day and everybody’s got uniforms. You’ll know, ‘Ah, they must’ve been cleared.’ ” \nUK will not comment on player eligibility until the season-opener, per a university spokesman. Kentucky freshman Skal Labissiere -- projected top draft pick -- has received NCAA eligibility to play 2015-16 season, sources tell Yahoo. 171 CONNECT 43 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1LSRwU6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:09:17.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
