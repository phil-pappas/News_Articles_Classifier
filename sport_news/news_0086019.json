(David Santiago / AP) Ira Winderman Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel \nTo say the Miami Heat have a busy upcoming week for the preseason would be an understatement, with back-to-back exhibitions on Monday and Tuesday and then another back-to-back set next weekend, with a public scrimmage at AmericanAirlines Arena in between on Wednesday night, basically five games in seven nights. \nBut that also comes with the Heat carrying a 20-player camp roster, five over the regular-season limit, and with no victory-at-any-cost demands on veterans. \nWhat matters most is what the NBA did for its players this offseason by reducing the number of back-to-back sets during the regular season and practically eliminating sets of four games in five nights. \nAs it turns out, the adjustment by the NBA came in the wake of a meeting between Heat guard Dwyane Wade and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \n\"I sat down with the Commissioner this summer and just sat and talked,\" Wade said after Friday's practice. \"His whole thing is about obviously growing the game and making the game be the number-one game in the world. And to do that, you've got to have your guys on the floor, you've got to have your star guys on the floor, you've got to have your players out there playing.
