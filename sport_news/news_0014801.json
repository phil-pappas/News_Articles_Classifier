(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nSteve Spurrier retired during his 11th season at South Carolina with a 228-89-2 record, not including bowl games, in his college coaching career. Spurrier was far more successful in the college ranks, where he led Duke to the 1989 ACC title and Florida to the 1996 national championship, than he was during a short stint with the Redskins from 2002-03. \nWhile Spurrier failed to coach ’em up in the NFL, the Head Ball Coach never failed to crack us up en route to 12-20. His two seasons in Washington are even funnier in hindsight. \nThe Gatorskins \nIn Spurrier’s mind, replicating the high-powered offense he was known for at Florida was as simple as bringing in a few of his former players . The Redskins roster featured five former Gators, all of them quarterbacks or wide receivers, in Spurrier’s first season. \n“Just remember, these Gators aren’t costing us very much,” Spurrier said in March 2002 after the Redskins signed quarterback Danny Wuerffel and wide receiver Reidel Anthony. \nNevermind that Wuerffel hadn’t started a game since 1998. \n“Did any of you see him play in college?” Spurrier said. “Tennessee and Georgia and Florida State, they play a little bit of defense. He didn’t do it all accidentally.” \nSpurrier said he’d dial back his Gator-hunting ways after a 7-9 season. \n“We’re certainly not against guys that went to Florida,” he said before the 2003 draft. “But probably because a lot of guys didn’t pan out the way we had hoped, we’re not going to be as quick to go after some of my former guys.” \nThe Redskins drafted Florida receiver Taylor Jacobs, who slipped to the second round. Wuerffel was released before Spurrier’s second season. This will be great. (Koji Sasahara/AP) \nOsaka Optimism \nSpurrier’s first game with Washington — a 38-7 preseason win over San Francisco in Osaka — provided false hope that the Redskins would be an offensive juggernaut under his watch. \n“The last game I had, I was standing up there getting a bowl of oranges,” Spurrier said after the win. “This one, it’s a nice trophy. . . . Winning and losing [a preseason game], nobody is going to [care] five, six weeks from now. But tonight there’s a winner and a loser, and we’re going home a winner. So the trip home won’t feel quite as long.” \nWashington cracked 30 points twice in the first five weeks of the 2002 season and only one other time in Spurrier’s two years in D.C. To commemorate Steve Spurrier's illustrious career, I shall salute him with a legendary NFL GIF. pic.twitter.com/JNWAO7MQMr \n— Jake Russell (@_JakeRussell) October 13, 2015 \n“It’s sleet.” \nFormer Redskins offensive lineman Tre’ Johnson told a story in 2009 about the time Spurrier exited the building at Redskins Park, walked into a wintry mix and asked, “What the hell’s this?” \n“No, we can’t go out in this,” Johnson recalled Spurrier responding. “Go watch some film fellas, go to the gym, do something, we can’t go out in this. Then Marvin Lewis comes out, N COACH WE GOTTA GO OUTSIDE!!!. You know, Marvin was our conscience. You loved Marvin, but [it was] like, ‘Damn Marv, we could have had another day off, c’mon man.’ ” \nAttention to Detail \nESPN’s John Keim shared a few funny stories from Spurrier’s tenure in D.C., including his struggles to remember the names of his defensive starters. Lineman Ross Tucker, who was cut by the Redskins midwday through Spurrier’s first season, has some great stories as well. \n“You know what’s crazy is I got cut by him midway through the year, and I got picked up on waivers the next day by the Cowboys,” Tucker said on 106.7 The Fan in 2011 . “So I went into Redskins Park to get my bag and all my stuff, and he looks at me and he says Cowboys, huh ? And I’m like yup . And he’s like, well, don’t be telling ‘em any of my secrets . I’m sitting there thinking number one dude, your secrets are pathetic, and number 2, as soon as I get there tomorrow, I’m actually going to tell them every single thing I can remember about your pathetic offense.” \nFinal Press Conference \nSpurrier’s end-of-season press conference after the Redskins went 5-11 in his second year was a classic. Via For The Win’s Chris Chase : \n“Big crowd here! Hey Frank! How we doin’ my man? \n“Who’s that guy with the Gator hat on? Yup. Florida Gator cap. \n“Got a big crowd in here! Ok, we wound up 5-11! Not very good! But there was some worse ‘un us. I guess that’s one positive way to look at it, we weren’t the worst team in the league. But it wa’n’t very good. And we’re disappointed. And offseason’s here, so we’ll try to regroup. And try to make this team, this franchise better. \n“Redskin fans deserve a championship team. They’re the best. I’ve said that many times, they fill the ballpark, scream and yell, and even though we didn’t play very well this year I thought they were super. Redskins fans are the best in pro football. That’s my opinion anyway. \n“Some guys had pretty daggum good years. I think our kickers, John Hall and Bryan Barker, had exceptional years, they really did. And a lot of players played well. A lot of players. But overall, we simply didn’t get it done, as coaches and players. We lose together. And certainly the close losses probably added up and we didn’t have much gas in our tank last night. \n“So I really don’t have a whole lot of great information for you guys today to sum up the season. And obviously when you have a disappointing year changes are gonna be made, we all know that, and hopefully all the changes will be for the best interests of the Redskins, and the Redskins will be a stronger year next year. So, when the changes are official, we’ll let everybody know, but right now, really, no official change in too much right now that I know about. So that’s where we are.” \nResignation \nHere’s Mark Maske on Spurrier’s resignation a few days later : \nThe final hours of Spurrier’s tenure were as confused and exasperating as much of his tenure with the team. On Monday, Spurrier retained agent Jimmy Sexton to work out the final details of the resignation and returned to his home in Florida. He informed Snyder of his resignation plans yesterday morning, according to the Redskins. \nThe Redskins received Sexton’s approval to announce Spurrier’s resignation with a midday news release, according to club officials. But Sexton was dealing with a personal matter and Spurrier’s cell phone battery died while he was on a Florida golf course. Spurrier used another cell phone to call a reporter and say that he had not resigned. In a second phone conversation, he said he had been made aware of what Sexton had told the Redskins but still wasn’t sure his resignation was official. He finally acknowledged the resignation in a third phone interview. \n“We had a little miscommunication,” Spurrier said, “but that’s all settled now. . . . I was not forced out. This was the best thing for all concerned. It’s time for someone else to have a chance to coach the Redskins . Maybe someone else can do better. . . . These people that do it in the NFL a long time — Bill Parcells, Bill Cowher — maybe there’s something different about them. It’s a long, tough grind, coaching in the NFL. There are some other things in my life that I’ve ignored that I’ll get around to doing now.” (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) Scott Allen writes about all things D.C. sports.
