(AP) — Muhammad Ali has tweeted support for the University of Louisville and basketball coach Rick Pitino despite a scandal in which an escort alleged in a book that former Cardinals staffer Andre McGee hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players. \nThe three-time champion and Louisville native posted comments from his fan and personal Twitter accounts Thursday evening that said, “From one champion to another, I will always stand behind and support UofL. Go Cards! #UniteLouisville.” The tweets did not reference the allegations that have led to four separate investigations. \nThe 73-year-old boxing great received the Grawemeyer Spirit Award from the school last month for helping inspire others, and he occasionally attends Cardinals football games. His son, Assad, played baseball at Louisville. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:32:12.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
