In fact, Pagano was so certain the Colts had possession he challenged the call even though he knew the replay had to show a “clear” recovery for the call to be overturned. \nPagano lost the challenge, and the New England Patriots took advantage of the good field position by driving for a touchdown. \nOf course, Pagano has taken plenty of criticism this week for gambling on another play: Down six points in the third quarter, Pagano called for an unusual formation and a fake punt that blew up in his face. A premature snap to the safety ended with the Patriots taking over and driving for a TD. \nNone of the failures seem likely to deter Pagano from staying aggressive. \n“We’ve got the best kicker in the league at doing it,” Pagano said earlier this week, a reference to Pat McAfee and his onside kicks. “I think our special teams coaches do a fabulous job of designing ways to get extra possessions if you will. If there’s something there and it’s to be had, I see these guys practice it and practice it and practice it over and over and over again during the week and weeks past. It’s not just something we pull the dust off.” \nWith Pagano in the final year of his contract, the Colts can’t afford to back down as they try to stay atop the AFC South. \nThey’re in the midst of a brutal five-game stretch in which they face some of the league’s best quarterbacks and top teams. After losing to Tom Brady and the perfect Patriots last weekend, they get Drew Brees and the Saints (2-4) on Sunday, Cam Newton and unbeaten Carolina the following week, Peyton Manning the unbeaten Broncos on Nov. 8 and Matt Ryan and the one-loss Falcons on Nov. 22. \nThat doesn’t mean anything goes, though. \nOffensive coordinator Pep Hamilton said Thursday it was never his intention to run 26 consecutive pass plays in the fourth quarter last weekend and that he has to do a better job finding balance even if the Colts are trying to get back into a game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:40:19.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
