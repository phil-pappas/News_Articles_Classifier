That's still a lot of points. \nBowling Green comes into the game 3-2 after a 28-22 win at Buffalo. UMass has never beaten the Falcons, falling 47-42, 28-7 and 24-0 over the past three years. \nUMass is 2-2 against the spread this season after Saturday's 24-14 win over Florida International. \nFor the Minutemen, this game is the most important they'll face in league play. As back-to-back MAC East champions, the road to Detroit goes through BG. The Falcons were picked to three-peat in the division during the preseason, and their play has lived up to those expectations so far, netting the team road victories at Maryland (48-27) and Purdue (35-28) another near-win against Memphis. \nSaturday's game kicks off at Doyt Perry Stadium in Ohio at 2 p.m. and will be broadcast online via ESPN3/WatchESPN. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T00:59:46.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
