Among the competitors for the boys will be Chase Kennedy, who won the Alexander Invitational in Douglasville last weekend, and the girls race will feature East Jackson’s Sue Ann Morales, who finished third in Douglasville. \n\nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 14 \nSoftball: First round of state tournament \nWinder-Barrow (15-14) finished as the fourth seed from Region 8- and will open play in the Class state tournament at Chapel Hill (23-2, the No. 1 seed from Region 5- ). \nIn Class AAAA, Madison County (19-10) and North Oconee (16-15) both qualified for state, with the Red Raiders the No. 3 seed and the Titans the fourth seed. Madison County will play at Whitewater (22-9, No. 2 seed from Region 5-AAAA) and North Oconee will play at Carrollton (20-5, No. 1 seed from Region 5-AAAA). \nIn Class AAA, Oconee County (13-15), East Jackson (21-10) and Jefferson (10-16) are all headed to state. The Warriors, the No. 2 seed from Region 8-AAA, will host Pepperell (17-8, No. 3 from Region 5-AAA), East Jackson (No. 3 seed) will play at Cedartown (21-7, No. 2 seed), and fourth-seeded Jefferson will play at Central, Carrollton (19-8, No. 1 seed). \nIn Class A, both Prince Avenue Christian (15-7) and Athens Christian (15-10) have both qualified for the Class A state tournament but were playing Monday in the final rounds of the Region 8-A tournament. The Wolverines were playing for the No. 1 seed and the Eagles were playing for the No. 3 seed and both will meet to-be-determined opponents. \nVolleyball: First round of state tournament \nIn Class , Winder-Barrow (30-20), the No. 3 seed from Region 8- will play at Chapel Hill (16-13-1, No. 2 seed from Region 5- ). \nIn Class AAAA, both North Oconee and Madison County advanced to state. The Titans (34-8, No. 2 seed from Region 8-AAAA) will host Redan (22-11), No. 3 seed from Region 5-AAAA) and the Red Raiders (19-19, No. 4 seed) will play at Jonesboro (15-11), No. 1 seed). \nIn Class AAA, Region 8-AAA’s top seed, Oconee County (28-12), will host South Atlanta (No. 4 seed from Region 4-AAA), Jefferson (34-7, No. 2 seed) will host North Clayton (10-15, No. 3 seed) and East Jackson (18-13, No. 4 seed) will play at top-seed Jackson in Butts County. \nIn Class A, Area 6-A champions Athens Academy (34-2) will host Whitefield Academy (14-22), the No. 4 seed from Area 5-A, at 6 p.m. \n\nFRIDAY, OCT. 16 \nFootball: George Walton at Athens Christian, 7:30 p.m. \nAthens Christian (3-4, 2-3 in Region 8-A) rebounded from its early season swoon to blister its last two opponents, Providence Christian (51-13) and Towns County (35-7). The test figures to be infinitely more difficult this week when the Eagles host George Walton (3-3, 3-1), which has outscored its last three opponents 107-20. If Athens Christian wants to improve in the Class A Private power rankings, this is a good place to start. \nFootball: Oconee County at Morgan County, 7:30 p.m. \nOconee County fans hope that last week’s bye won’t cool down the Warriors (5-1, 2-0 in Region 8-AAA), who before their week respite defeated Greene County, East Jackson and Jackson County by a combined 99-3 score. After Friday, the Warriors still have Hart County, Jefferson and Elbert County left to play, so gathering more momentum is critical against Morgan County (3-3, 1-1), which was shut out by Jefferson last weekend. \nFootball: North Hall at Madison County, 7:30 p.m. \nThe Red Raiders (1-5, 1-2 in Region 8-AAAA) snapped an eight-game losing streak dating back to late last year with a tremendous effort Friday at Chestatee, scoring 31 first-quarter points in a 59-29 victory. North Hall (2-4, 1-2) whipped up on North Oconee two weeks ago and was crushed by Buford on Friday. It will be interesting to see if Madison County can produce another exciting performance, as the Red Raiders close out the season with Buford, Stephens County and North Oconee. \n— Chris Starrs/Staff \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:54:29.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
