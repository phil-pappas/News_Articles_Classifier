One of things greatly affecting the odds and lines this week are all the quarterback changes that have occurred. Reliable starters and proven winners like Tony Romo, Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees have been replaced by unreliable backups like Brandon Weeden, Michael Vick and Luke McCown.\nIn Chicago, the Bears are struggling without Jay Cutler and in Cleveland the Browns keep starting a quarterback who has never had much success in the league instead of giving a younger QB a chance. That is always a big mistake. Good luck to all the NFL teams and especially the bettors in Week 4 of the NFL season!\nBaltimore -2.5 at Pittsburgh (O/U is 44) Even though the team is 0-3 in 2015 the Baltimore Ravens are a 2.5 point favorite playing at Pittsburgh this Thursday night. The Ravens are favored because the Steelers are playing without QB Ben Roethlisberger. Replacing Roethlisberger is Michael Vick who has a 59-50-1 record as a starting QB in the NFL. Vick is only 6-13 as a starter since 2012.\nNew York Jets -2 vs Miami Dolphins in London (O/U is 41) The New York Jets are favored by two points over the Miami Dolphins in a game that will be played starting at 9:30 am EDT in Wembley Stadium in London, England. This is the first game for the Jets in London, while the Miami Dolphins are 1-1 playing overseas in England. The over/under for this game is low at 41. In the previous 11 NFL regular season games played in London the average points scored per game is 47.7.\nJacksonville +9 at Indianapolis (O/U is 47) The Colts finally got a win in Week 3 but it was not easy as they beat the Titans 35-33. The Jaguars got tattooed by a score of 51-17 last week by the fired up New England Patriots . The line for this game is pretty high at nine points. Andrew Luck's career record as a starting QB in the NFL is 34-17. Luck leads the AFC with seven interceptions in 2015.\nHouston +6.5 at Atlanta (O/U is 46.5) The Texans finally got a win last week as they beat the Buccaneers 19-9. The Falcons are 3-0 after they stormed back from a halftime deficit to beat the Cowboys 39-28. Atlanta is averaging 29 points per game while the Texans are only giving up 16.7 points per game. So something is going to have to give in this game.\nCarolina -3 at Tampa Bay (O/U is 40) Jameis Winston is certainly a work in progress and things won't get any easier this week vs Carolina. The Panthers are giving up just 16 points per game which is third best in the league. The Buccaneers are averaging just 16.3 points per game. Tampa Bay is a home underdog this week but only bet them if you believe in Jameis Winston.\nNew York Giants +6 at Buffalo (O/U is 47) Six points is a lot to be giving up vs Eli Manning and the New York Giants. Eli Manning has a record of 92-78 in the NFL as a starting QB, but he's just 14-21 since 2013. The Bills were dominant last week vs Miami but were helped a lot by three Ryan Tannehill picks including a pick-six.\nOakland Raiders -3 at Chicago Bears (O/U is 44) The Raiders beat the Browns 27-20 last week in Cleveland as an underdog. This week the Raiders are favored on the road at Chicago. The big question mark for this game is will Jay Cutler play? The Bears were shutout last week by the Seahawks with Jimmy Clausen at QB. Clausen is now 1-11 lifetime in the NFL as a starting QB. At least his pro beach volleyball wife is hot .\nEagles -3 at Washington (O/U is 47.5) The Eagles finally got a win last week vs the Jets. This is a game featuring two QBs who have never had much success in the NFL. Sam Bradford's record as a starting QB is 19-32-1 while Kirk Cousins is just 3-9. If the QBs stink look to the coaches. Chip Kelly is 21-14 as a NFL head coach while Jay Gruden is 5-14.\nKansas City +3.5 at Cincinnati (O/U is 42.5) That was a really good win last week for the Bengals at the Ravens to improve their record to 3-0. The Chiefs faced an almost impossible task trying to beat the Packers at Lambeau on Monday night. This game should be easier for the Chiefs but can they win it?\nCleveland +7.5 at San Diego (O/U is 45) Why would the Browns start Josh McCown who has a career record of 17-34 in the NFL as a starting QB over Johnny Manziel? It makes no sense and it's a great way for a coach to get fired. Everybody already knows Josh McCown stinks. Johnny Manziel might stink too but give him the chance to prove otherwise.\nMinnesota +6.5 at Denver (O/U is 43) Peyton Manning is the opposite of Josh McCown. Manning has a lifetime record of 182-77. So even though he obviously cannot thrown the ball the down the field well anymore he just keeps winning by making the throws he can still do. Eventually, Manning's arm strength problems will catch up to him especially in the playoffs but until then he wins games.\nGreen Bay -9.5 at San Francisco (O/U is 48) Colin Kaepernick was awful last week throwing four picks including two pick-sixes in the 49ers embarrassing 47-7 loss to the Cardinals. The 49ers have played awful in their two road games but did play well at home when they beat the Vikings in Week 1 by a score of 20-3. So there's some hope the 49ers can play well this week at home vs the Packers.\nSt. Louis +6.5 at Arizona (O/U is 42.5) The Cardinals crushed the Bears and the 49ers over the last two weeks. Can they do the same to the Rams at home this week? The Rams are up against it the next two weeks having to play at Arizona Sunday and then play the Packers at Lambeau next week. Expect the Rams to play hard this week.\nDallas +4 at New Orleans (O/U is 46) This game hinges a lot on the status of Drew Brees. If Brees can play the Saints obviously have a much better chance than if they have to go with backup Luke McCown. The Cowboys have to start Brandon Weeden or Matt Cassel with Tony Romo out. Weeden's record as a starting QB in the NFL is 5-17 while Cassel is 34-38.\nDetroit +9.5 at Seattle (O/U is 43) Will Matthew Stafford ever be a winning quarterback in the NFL? The guy has a great arm but he makes awful throws and the Lions are 0-3 this season after going 11-5 last year. Seattle finally got a win last week vs the hapless Bears. Was it a coincidence that Seattle shutout the Bears last week and got a win with Kam Chancellor back?", "external_links": ["http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/V/VickMi00.htm", "http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/KellCh0.htm", "http://www.footballlocks.com/nfl_odds.shtml"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:21:59.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
