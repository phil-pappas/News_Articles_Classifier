Susana Martinez and the Republican-led House.\n“I call it anti-worker legislation, because that is what it is,” he said.\nHe also said collective bargaining has resulted in safer working conditions, 40-hour workweeks, higher salaries, paid sick leave, health care benefits and retirement pensions.\nThe day included remarks by Obama and a town hall with him.\nAt least one other New Mexican also was at the summit: Carmella Salinas, an early childhood educator in Española and a member of New Mexico Early Educators United, an affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers. Salinas is president of PEOPLE for the Kids, a partnership of educators, parents and early learning center owners.\nAG GALLERY: Attorney General Hector Balderas and some of his predecessors will officially dedicate a portrait gallery of New Mexico’s AGs dating back to territorial days at the Santa Fe office on Friday.\nFormer U.S. Sen. Fred Harris will moderate the program, which will include remarks by Balderas and these former attorneys general: former U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, former Gov. Toney Anaya, Paul Bardacke, Gary King, David Norvell and Hal Stratton.\nThe portrait gallery – mostly photos – honors attorneys general reaching back to 1846. Located just off the main lobby of the AG’s Office, the Hall of Attorneys General will be open to the public during office hours.\nThe dedication ceremony will be held at 3 p.m. Friday in the courtyard next to the office.\nNew Mexico has had 51 attorneys general. The only woman among them, Patricia Madrid, had a scheduling conflict, according to a spokesman for Balderas.\nDeborah Baker: dbaker@abqjournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:17:37.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
