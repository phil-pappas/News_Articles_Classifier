The name was rejected.\n“I think it’s kind of silly,” a university spokesman said at the time.\nBut that was the point. Stanford has always had a countercultural side. Now, as it is a more buttoned-up university with teams named the Cardinal (as in the color, like the Harvard Crimson) and innumerable Silicon Valley connections, the best place to find traces of the university’s insouciant ethos is the student-run band, which, in a nod to the institution’s full name, refers to itself as the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band.\n“It really emphasizes the history of Stanford’s student body — intelligent but can cut loose,” the drum major Peter Adelson, a senior who is known as Sippycup, said of the band.\nCampus Corner A look at some of the well-known and not-so-well-known college football traditions on campuses across the country.
