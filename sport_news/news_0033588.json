(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) \nTORONTO (AP) — Mike Hoffman had the decisive goal in the first shootout of the NHL season, sending the Ottawa Senators to a 5-4 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday night. \nKyle Turris, Alex Chiasson, Milan Michalek and Mark Stone scored in regulation for the Senators, and Craig Anderson finished with 37 saves. Reigning Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson had three assists. \nThe NHL moved to a 3-on-3 overtime for this season to cut back on shootouts, and the Senators and Maple Leafs played the first tiebreaker in the league's 19th game. Anderson had seven saves in OT. \nPierre-Alexandre Parenteau scored for Toronto in the first round of the shootout, but Tyler Bozak and Joffrey Lupul were unsuccessful. Bobby Ryan tied it at 1 in the second round before Hoffman lifted Ottawa to the win. \nLupul, Bozak, Peter Holland and Daniel Winnik scored in regulation for Toronto, which trailed 3-0 early in the second period. James Reimer made 29 saves. \nAfter the Leafs dominated a scoreless first period, Turris put the Senators in front 46 seconds into the second. As four Toronto penalty killers converged on the boards, Karlsson found a wide-open Turris in the slot for his third goal of the season in his 400th NHL game. \nOttawa quickly added two more power-play goals. Chiasson left the penalty box to score on a breakaway at 3:38 of the second, and Michalek corralled a rebound of a shot by Karlsson and beat Reimer in front at 4:56. \nWith Winnik pressuring, Ottawa defenseman Patrick Wiercioch turned the puck over right to Lupul at 7:05, and he scored the Leafs' first even-strength goal of the season. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:15:05.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
