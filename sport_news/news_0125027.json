You’ve got some flour on your face there, Shelly! Look at these happy dorm mates– they spent all day on these two cupcakes, and they’re going to be delicious. Get out of here Jason, these two cupcakes are for ladies only ! Just kidding; you can have one half of one of them so we all get an even amount. Would you like some sprinkles? We have a whole bowl full and again we only have two cupcakes so we have plenty. \nThere’s no place better to study the natural sciences than Mississippi State University. Ken is going to sit on all these dinosaur eggs until one of them hatches. Good luck, Ken! \n“Do you like the wonderful cafeteria food here at MSU?”“What?”“Don’t you think the food here is good?”“Oh, I’m sorry, I’m listening to contemporary pop music on my headphones. They’re way bigger than they need to be.”“Hahaha, yes they are. Do my headphones look good too? I can’t hear any music on them.”“That’s because your headphones are covering your dreadlocks, not your ears.” \n“Gretchen, I don’t know how to put this, because you’ve done such a great job on Captain Jangles, but Mrs. Everly in room 22A just passed away. Were you aware of that? There’s probably going to be a lawsuit. You should have probably been paying more attention.” \nIntroducing your 2015-16 Student Government officers!

If you see NorTron X89 on campus PLEASE DO NOT APPROACH IT. It’s a tragedy, yes; but you can’t make an omelet without breaking some eggs, right? For the greater good! \nMississippi State’s Judo team won top SEC honors last in last year’s conference-wide competition, except for Barry. Get out of the picture Barry. No, you DON’T get a trophy.
