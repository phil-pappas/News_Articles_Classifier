In case you haven’t heard, wildlife biologists with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department recently announced plans to ramp up their efforts to collect more tissue samples from hunter harvested whitetail deer for CWD testing this fall and winter. TPWD made the announcement in a press release last week, citing the recent discovery of CWD in two captive-deer breeding facilities in Medina and Lavaca counties as the primary motive for testing more wild deer in the state’s eight ecological regions. Both facilities remain under quarantine as the investigation continues and deer breeders all over the state are now required to adhere to restrictive guidelines under a Breeder Deer Movement Qualification Standards Plan before they can relocate deer from one facility to the next or release breeder deer into the wild for hunting. Finalized in mid-August, the plan has stirred up quite a stink resulting in Texas deer breeders filing a lawsuit against TPWD in Travis County District Court. The court document indicates that deer breeders feel the action plan violates their rights, and that the plan was developed “largely in secret, in violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.” Filed on Oct. 1, the Executive Summary of Petition document names Carter Smith, TPWD Executive Director, Clayton Wolf, TPWD Wildlife Division Director, and Mitch Lockwood, TPWD Big Game Program Director, as the defendants in the lawsuit. CWD is a contagious neurological disease that is always fatal. It affects deer, elk and other cervids and can remain on the landscape for years in the form of animal wastes and carcasses. CWD was first recognized in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado. It has since been documented in captive and/or free-­ranging deer in 23 states as well as Canada. The disease was first detected in Texas in 2012 in free-ranging mule deer in the Hueco Mountains in far West Texas. However, it has never been documented in a free-ranging Texas whitetail. TPWD began monitoring the state’s free-ranging whitetail deer herd for CWD in 2003 through random testing of brain stems collected mostly at packaging houses from hunter-harvested deer. To date, about 30,000 samples from wild whitetail deer from the state’s eight ecological regions have been tested with no confirmed CWD cases. Around 4,000 whitetails have been CWD tested with negative results in the Pineywoods region alone, according to District 6 wildlife biologist Gary Calkins of Jasper. “We’ve met our sampling goal of 300-400 animals every year since 2003,” Calkins said. “The Pineywoods and Hill Country have been sampling at a pretty intense level. Not because we feel like there is any kind of threat, but because that’s the way we go about our business. To my knowledge our other districts are pretty close to that.” Calkins says he has set a goal to double the number of Pineywoods deer tested for CWD this year. Other districts across the state will be ramping up their testing efforts as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:12:28.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
