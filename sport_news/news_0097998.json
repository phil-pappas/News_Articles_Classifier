Edison's football team reached a higher gear Saturday afternoon and rallied for a 16-12 victory over Spencer-Van Etten at Northrop Field behind big plays from the offense, defense and special teams. \nJunior quarterback Adam Houghtling scored the go-ahead points on a 1-yard run in the third quarter that was set up by a blocked punt. \nThe Spartans' defense, victimized by two touchdowns from the Panthers' passing game in the first half, shut out Spencer-Van Etten in the second half after avoiding a three-score deficit with a goal-line stand in the second quarter. \n\"I think when Spencer went up 12-0, the seniors rallied the kids,\" Edison head coach Mike Bennett said. \"I heard a lot of talk about, 'Keep your heads up,' from our captains, who led the team here. I think really it was nothing to do with coaching or anything; it was just that the boys on the field decided this is not how we want to go and they changed it.\" \nTarryl Garner scored on a 41-yard run with 1 minute, 48 seconds remaining in the first half to help send the Spartans into halftime down 12-8. \nBoth touchdowns for Spencer-Van Etten (0-4) came on throws from junior Anthony Chiusano to junior Garrett Swayze. The first was a screen pass on the game's opening drive that covered 44 yards and the second was a 21-yarder that saw Swayze make a diving catch in the end zone on third-and-15. Swayze finished with five catches for 93 yards and ran 11 times for 53 yards. Chiusano passed for 136 yards. \nThe Panthers recovered an onside kick after Swayze's second score and were in position to extend their 12-0 lead after picking up four first downs. But Edison, facing third-and-goal from its own 5, stuffed the next two plays and took the ball over at its own 4. A 25-yard scramble from Houghtling and a 12-yard gain from Logan Baker helped get the ball inside S-VE territory. Garner took the ball on a counter and found an opening before outracing the Panthers' defense for Edison's first points. Houghtling ran in the 2-point conversion to cut the lead to 12-8. \n\"That goal-line stand kept us in the game, no doubt about it,\" Bennett said. \"We took the ball from that goal-line stand and went right down and made it a one-score game. That's a huge turning point in the game. ... It really boosted the kids at halftime. The energy in the locker room at halftime was tremendous. They were really hungry today.\" \nThe Spartans, coming off a 1-8 record in 2014, lost their first three games this season by scores of 46-12 to Elmira Notre Dame, 26-6 to Moravia and 31-0 to Lansing. With the potential to break into the win column, the players didn't want a second-half letdown. \n\"We had a pretty good motivational talk in the locker room,\" senior offensive lineman/linebacker Corey Garrison said. \"We switched some stuff. Coach got into our heads that we needed to go 100 percent harder, so we all did.\" \nBoth teams went three-and-out on offense to start the second half, but a low snap on Spencer-Van Etten's punt led to a block that set up the Spartans at the Panthers' 1-yard line. Houghtling sneaked in on the next play and his two-point pass gave Edison a 16-12 lead with 8:07 remaining in the third quarter. \nHoughtling finished with 80 yards on 16 carries and Baker added 54 yards on 11 attempts.
