The Division Bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Sureshwar Thakur directed the CBI not to file challan without the court’s permission in the FIR registered in Delhi on September 23. The Bench also directed the CBI and the Himachal Chief Secretary to file their replies within four weeks and listed the matter for further hearing on November 18. The court orders came on a petition filed by the CM and his wife Pratibha Singh seeking quashing of the FIR. The couple had questioned the CBI raids at their premises on September 26, which coincided with the wedding of their daughter. “By way of abundant precaution, it is made clear that the petitioners shall not be arrested. It is also made clear that as and when the dossier is complete, it shall be open for the CBI to approach this court for permission to interrogate the petitioners in accordance with law,” the court observed. Arguing for Virbhadra, senior counsel Kapil Sibal contended that the registration of the FIR was in violation of a Supreme Court law. The mandatory consent from the state government under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act was not obtained at the time of registration of the FIR, investigation and carrying out raids at the premises of the CM, he claimed. Sibal maintained that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and CBI Manual too were not followed. He claimed permission from the Himachal Legislative Assembly Speaker should also have been obtained. Arguing for the CBI, Assistant Solicitor General Ashok Sharma contended that the petition was not maintainable. He said “no part of cause of action had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this court”, and that the Delhi High Court was already aware of the matter. He said there was no proposal of any arrests. For disposing of the petition, the court also formulated 11 points, including whether cause of action had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the FIR registered by the CBI. It also raised a question whether there could be second preliminary enquiry after the closure of the earlier such exercise purportedly as per the CBI manual.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:01:29.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
