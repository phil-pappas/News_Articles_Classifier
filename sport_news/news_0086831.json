He's not alone in the Mountain West, because it's not as if many great ones remain for the taking once Power Five conferences are finished signing them each February. This isn't a good league by any means and you don't need two hands to list the number of truly gifted quarterbacks in it. You might not need more than a finger or two.\nPalandech made his first career start in place of injured senior Black Decker, and the sophomore nearly executed enough plays to rally UNLV all the way back from a 10-point second-half deficit and steal a West Division victory.\nBut he is limited in the passing game to the point you wouldn't think there exists many teams on UNLV's schedule he could beat through the air. It makes him serviceable but not dangerous, in need of several good things to happen elsewhere for the Rebels to find the end zone.\n\"I thought he did a good job extending plays with his feet,\" Sanchez said. \"I'm proud of him. He got into a nice rhythm at the end.\"\nPalandech completed 15 of 30 passes for 217 yards and two scores, both touchdown passes coming in the fourth quarter and the last one with 3:41 remaining in regulation that pushed UNLV back into the lead at 24-20.\nHe played really well there for about eight to 10 critical minutes.\nBut he also threw two interceptions, one with UNLV up 7-0 and driving deep into San Jose State territory and another that led to a Spartans touchdown that tied the game at 10 midway through the second quarter.\nHe makes mistakes you'd expect from a young quarterback — holding onto the ball too long, taking sacks at the worst of times, not going through his entire progression and choosing to tuck-and-run instead of showing patience as things develop in space.\nSanchez on Tuesday said the Rebels might throw Saturday night more than they had all season, and they actually attempted six more passes than their average through five games. But he also said UNLV coaches wanted Palandech to attack, attack, attack.\nHe isn't built for that. Not as a passer.\nHe's good enough with his feet — Palandech rushed 18 times for a team-best 47 yards — that defenses have to honor that part of his game. You would think that might open up more downfield opportunities. It really doesn't.\nDecker is a solid Mountain West quarterback with a banged up left shoulder. Dalton Sneed is a freshman who the Rebels are intent on redshirting this season. Some believe he's the future. No one knows for sure.\nBut in a conference where it appears anyone not named Boise State could find themselves close to even in ability on a weekly basis, quarterback play becomes even more significant than usual. This game was there to be won, and while Palandech certainly didn't take part in a forgettable fourth-quarter defensive breakdown — where the closest Rebel on a 21-yard scoring screen pass for the Spartans off fourth-and-10 was in Ely — he needed to make more plays early once UNLV led 10-0.\n\"If you look in our locker room right now, the guys are just devastated,\" Sanchez said. \"These are games we expect to win. We're not being pushed around and walked over any more. We have to continue to improve. There is no quit in our guys. That's a positive. We want to play for the conference championship and win the West. That road will be a little tougher now, but it's still doable.\"\nThe quest continues at Fresno State on Friday night against a Bulldogs team best described as awful. UNLV will be the better team and a victory would push its conference record to 2-1. There is much to play for if you're the Rebels.\nThe assumption is that Decker would return, but if the season's first six games have told us anything, it's that he will at times find himself in harm's way and hurt. It's almost certain Palandech will play more this year, and with time and experience often comes better reads and results and resiliency.\nBut quarterback isn't a position of strength for UNLV, and that makes winning difficult.\n\"I need to watch the film,\" Sanchez said.\nKnow this: It won't lie.\n— Ed Graney can be reached at egraney@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-4618.
