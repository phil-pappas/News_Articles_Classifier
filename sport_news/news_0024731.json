Are we trying to encourage defections from one party to another? This is not for our political gain ... this is to make the government respond,\" Leader of opposition in the assembly K Jana Reddy (Congress) said.\nThe people had served \"first warning\" to the government through today's bandh, he said.\nClaiming that the bandh was a success, TDP leader L Ramana said the opposition had come together on the issue of farmers' welfare keeping aside their (separate) party flags.\nMeanwhile, agriculture minister Pocharam Srinivasa Reddy said the bandh had failed.\n\"Farmers, for whom they have called the bandh, did not support it in any district or mandal. The farmers did not participate because they know the history of these parties. Congress and TDP do not have opportunity to criticise the government on any issue. That's why they are doing all this on the loan waiver issue,\" he said.\nIT, Panchayat Raj minister K T Rama Rao said the government was in touch with RBI for waiving farm loans at once.\nThe opposition's demand is that loan waiver (of Rs 8,500 crore) be announced at one go, to deal with the agrarian crisis and the farmer suicides. The government had paid about Rs 8,000 crore in loan waivers earlier.
