It was a positive finish after an ugly start.\nThe Diamondbacks can only hope it was a sort of metaphor for his time in the organization; Lopez had, by all accounts, a rocky first season in professional baseball.\nThe Diamondbacks spent more than $16 million to sign the 22-year-old Cuban in January – a signing bonus north of $8 million, plus another $8 million in penalties for exceeding their international allotment – because they believed he was a potential frontline starting pitcher who could help their big-league rotation in short order.\nAZCENTRAL\nBickley: Diamondbacks must bring playoffs back to Valley\nBut Lopez did not pitch well in spring training and was sent to Double-A Mobile, the beginning of a turbulent year in which his results were only fair, his health inconsistent and his behavior off the field highly questionable. It is far too soon to call Lopez a bust, but his season did not unfold the way the Diamondbacks had hoped.\nThe low point of the year came during the first week of July. Sources said he did not board the team bus to the ballpark in Jackson, Tenn., on July 2, a day before he was scheduled to pitch. Without notifying the organization, he apparently left town.\nOn July 3, a photo of him was posted to someone else’s Twitter account. “Me and Yoan Lopez of the Arizona DiamondBacks chilling at the Crib,” the tweet reads .\nMe and Yoan Lopez of The Arizona DiamondBacks chilling at the Crib. #Mlb #Cubans #Baseball pic.twitter.com/n1K5dZjpeL\n— V I C E (@ALMIGHTY_GABE) July 3, 2015 The owner of the account lists his residence as south Florida, which was where, days later, the Diamondbacks managed to track him down, according to sources.\nThat wasn’t Lopez’s only misstep. At one point, multiple sources say, he posted a video to his Snapchat account in which he was wearing a Miami Marlins hat and saying, “No mas D-Backs; ahora Miami Marlins.”\nLopez would not comment for this story, saying through an interpreter he wanted to focus on the upcoming Arizona Fall League season. He is not known to have publicly addressed his departure from the team.\nAZCENTRAL\nDiamondbacks XTRA app: Get latest news, analysis, scores, photos\nThrough a spokesman, Diamondbacks Chief Baseball Officer Tony La Russa issued a statement on Lopez.\n“As a very young man in a completely new country, Yoan had some challenges in his first year in the U.S., but we are glad that he has learned from those experiences and is focused on improving both on and off the field,” La Russa said. “It’s a learning process that all of us in MLB expect and are prepared to help our young players handle.”\nAfter the Diamondbacks found Lopez in Florida, they sent him to Arizona, ostensibly so he could work his way back into shape before going back to Mobile in late July, where he apologized to his teammates prior to his return to the mound. It is unclear if he was fined by the organization for his absence. Throughout the summer, Diamondbacks officials said only that he was away from the team due to “personal reasons.”\nIt was during Lopez’s hiatus in Arizona that he hit No. 1 overall pick Dansby Swanson in the face with a fastball during a simulated game at Salt River Fields. Farm director Mike Bell said at the time that Lopez “felt awful” and texted multiple times to check on Swanson’s condition. Swanson needed 14 stitches and suffered a concussion.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Diamondbacks' Archie Bradley motivated, eager\nLopez missed about a month early in the year with a blister on his finger, and his season ended early when he experienced elbow discomfort in August.\nWhen Lopez did pitch, he drew mixed reviews from scouts. The most positive among them viewed him as a potential back-of-the-rotation starter. He made only 10 appearances for Mobile, posting a 4.69 ERA with 32 strikeouts and 24 walks in 48 innings.\nDuring his outing on Thursday, his fastball ranged from 92-96, though he left several up in the zone. At times, he showed a sharp slider, although he hung one that was hit for a monster three-run homer by San Francisco Giants prospect Chris Shaw. In his five innings, Lopez walked two and struck out one. He is expected to transition this week to the fall league, where he'll pitch for the Salt River Rafters.\nAZCENTRAL\nPitching a focus for Arizona Diamondbacks' offseason\nThough he was said to have rubbed many teammates the wrong way, multiple sources said his behavior and attitude improved upon his return to Mobile. Lopez was escorted back to Double-A by coach Larry Pardo, who was said to have served as his chaperone the rest of the year. One source said that when Lopez needed to return to Florida for a personal matter later in the season, Pardo accompanied him there, as well.\n“It was his first year in the U.S., and there’s a huge cultural difference,” minor-league pitching coordinator Dan Carlson said during an interview in September. “I think (Bell) had Larry Pardo go out there and more or less be his support. Once that happened, that truly helped him out a lot. There were some off-the-field issues of just getting used to the U.S.\n“I think in Cuba, he had somebody watch over his every move. You grow up that way and now you’re the one who has to make all the decisions -- I don’t know if he was fully equipped to handle all those decisions.”\nNLDS Game 1: Mets vs. Dodgers - David Wright's two-run single in the 7th inning gives the Mets a 3-0 lead.
