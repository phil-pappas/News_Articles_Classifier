My gift to them is 50 minutes of college football previewing and against-the-spread picking, plus whatever I choose off their Amazon wish list. \nWe begin in the SEC with Tennessee - Georgia , Alabama - Arkansas and Florida - Missouri before taking it national with Michigan - Northwestern (with Over/Under picks too!), Georgia Tech - Clemson , Miami - Florida State , Utah - Cal and much, much more. \nDon't forget there are many ways to access the SEC on CBS Sports Podcast. You can download to MP3s below or subscribe on iTunes , Stitcher Radio and TuneIn . \n( MP3 download )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:43:30.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
