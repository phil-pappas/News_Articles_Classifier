They raised their play to a higher level during the third game and went on to win. \nThe victory raises the Lady Vikings’ District 32-5A record to 4-4, which is tied with Porter and trails Edcouch-Elsa (7-1), PSJA High (7-1) and Donna High (6-2). Behind Pace and Porter in 32-5A are Mercedes (2-6), PSJA Southwest (2-6) and Donna North (0-8). The top four teams go to the playoffs, so the Oct. 17 match between the Lady Vikings and Cowgirls at Pace promises to be a huge one. \nPace coach Gavin Rudder hopes Tuesday’s victory provides some momentum for his team’s upcoming matches. \n“What stood out the most to me was the fact that we lost the first two sets and didn’t give up,” Rudder said. “We showed a lot of heart and fight to continue on and win the next three games. \n“I hope we can carry that same mindset and momentum into Saturday’s match (at home) against Donna (High), and really, the rest of the season,” he added. “If we continue to play the way we are playing, we can do some very good things.” \nAfter playing host to Donna High at 2 p.m. Saturday, the Pace girls play at PSJA High next Tuesday before entertaining Porter on Oct. 17. \n“The next three matches are very important for us,” Rudder said. \n  @ HessRgehess. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:47:59.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
