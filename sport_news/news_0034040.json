With a veteran team that won a playoff game last season, there was very little chance of the Generals falling there. \nMilwaukee Riverside, King's No. 1 rival in a handful of sports, is the kind of matchup that could elevate the Generals' focus. \nThe bottom line remained the same, though. King scored a 38-15 victory over the Tigers in a non-conference game Thursday at Custer Stadium to complete an undefeated season. \n\"That's real important to get juiced up for the playoffs and have that big game,\" said King coach Tom Wozniak, whose team improved to 9-0. \"These guys just know each other from the neighborhood. They play each other in multiple sports. It's a big rivalry for us and it's nice for them to have that big game at the end of the season for sure.\" \nJunior quarterback Justice King had a combined 211 yards rushing and passing, and Devin Lacy, a junior running back, had 133 yards in 25 carries for the Generals. Meanwhile the defense, which had posted four consecutive shutouts, held Riverside to 188 yards and returned an interception for a touchdown. \nThere was one key loss in the personnel department, though. Junior Royce Buckner, who entered play with a team-high 641 receiving yards, took a helmet-to-helmet hit in the first quarter and didn't return. \n\"I feel like this game was very beneficial to us,\" senior linebacker Julius Buchanan said. \"We got to see a team that's playoff material. They can play in the playoffs and they have played in the playoffs and went to the semifinals in 2011.... \n\"Running against them was a good test for us so that we can look at film and see we did wrong and then fix that, so that we can do better in the playoffs.\" \nWhat the film will show is two trips inside the red zone and another inside the Riverside 25 in the first half that produced no points for the Generals. \nThe team was never out of control, though. Buckner set the tone by returning the opening kickoff to the Riverside 13. Four plays later, Lacy scored from 2 yards for the first of his two touchdowns. Justice King's two-point conversion made it 8-0 with 9 minutes 53 seconds left in the first quarter. \nThe Generals' other score of the half came with 16 seconds left on a 24-yard halfback option from senior Chris McCants to junior D'Anthony Lee on fourth and 10. Justice King's two-point conversion made it 16-0 with 10 seconds left in the half. \nIn between those scores, Justice King had a pass intercepted by senior defensive Elijah Dotson at the 5 after it bounced off a receiver's hands. Later in the second quarter, King's pass on fourth and 14 at the 22 was just out of the reach of Lee. Another possession ended during that quarter with a ball being dropped in the end zone on another fourth-down play. \nA short punt gave the Generals a first down at the Tigers 24 with 47 seconds left in the half, and this time the team wouldn't be denied thanks to some razzle-dazzle. \n\"We wanted to punch it in. That was our message,\" Wozniak said. \"We're not (always) going to get all these opportunities. Let's take advantage of them when we get them. That was huge.\" \nAfter Buchanan returned an interception 30 yards three plays into the second half, it was clear that King was on its way to a victory. The Generals and the rest of the state's playoff qualifiers will learn of their matchups Saturday. \n\"I feel like we're going to be a really good playoff team this year,\" Buchanan said, \"because I feel like we all have the heart and the determination to be something great.\" \nRiverside, which dropped to 5-4 and finished with a 5-1 record in the Richardson Division, will play in the postseason as well, though the Tigers are battling a number of injuries. \n\"We've just got to get healthy. We're banged up. That is our biggest problem,\" Riverside coach Patrick Wagner said. \"It's always been little nagging injuries....They're a better team than we are and the scoreboard showed it.\" Â© 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
