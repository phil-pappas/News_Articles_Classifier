His yards were muted slightly by the fact he went under center to start the second half, quarterbacking two series to kick off the third quarter. \nRunningback Enrique Rivera went off for 71 second-half yards and a touchdown. \nMeanwhile, Live Oak’s offense sputtered. \nThe Acorns’ average starting field position was its own 82, compared to Oak Grove starting on average at its own 44. \nErik Ornduff completed just four passes for 61 yards with two interceptions. \nRunningback Jacob Ryder went for 41 yards on seven carries and a lost fumble. \nThe two teams were even in the turnover battle, 3-3, and the Eagles really didn’t make Live Oak’s turnovers hurt other than by killing drives. Oak Grove turned Live Oak’s three turnovers into just seven points, but two of the turnovers came at crucial times. \nAt the end of the second quarter, the Acorns were pushed back on their own 10 when a pair of passes to Mitch Conforti got the Acorns up to their own 45. \nBut the drive ended when Ornduff was intercepted by Anu Tuiono at midfield. \nTuiono returned the ball to the end zone, but a pair of personal foul penalties called on the Eagles negated the score and Live Oak got a turnover on downs to end the half. \nThen in Live Oak’s first drive of the third quarter and Oak Grove leading 22-0 following a 10-play, 70-yard touchdown, Ornduff was scrambling and tried to thread the ball into double coverage. \nTuiono tipped the ball and Grady Ryan came down with the interception, just keeping the ball off the ground on a diving play. \nAgain, Oak Grove failed to score, instead settling for a three-and-out. \nThe final Live Oak turnover proved the most costly. \nThe Eagles had gone up 29-0 at the start of the fourth quarter and Live Oak was once again driving. \nRyder had the ball past midfield and was fighting for more yards when he was hit from behind and the ball popped out and into the arms of Tuiono. \nThis time the Eagles did score, putting the game away at 36-0 and starting a fourth-quarter running clock. \nThings started well enough for the Live Oak offense, as a Conforti pass to Paul Lomanto fell incomplete leading to a Oak Grove being called for a pass interference on the game’s first play from scrimmage. \nLive Oak converted on third down on a Lomanto run, but that’s where the drive stalled thanks to two false starts. \nBut the defense answered the bell. \nDespite Fontenette rolling early, the drive eventually stalled at midfield, forcing an Eagle punt. \nLive Oak’s ensuing drive stalled deep in its own territory and Fontenette returned a punt deep into Acorn territory. \nTuiono got the Eagles on the board on a dive play that went 38 yards for an early 7-0 lead. \nIt wasn’t until late in the second quarter that Oak Grove found the endzone again. \nOak Grove was facing second and 37 when quarterback Tyler McGovern hit Marcel Baker for a 45-yard pass setting up Fontenette for his first score of the night from three-yards out. \nAfter Live Oak got flagged for too many men on the field, Fontenette converted the two-point play for a 15-0 lead. \nThat’s where the game stood at the half. \nGemo said he felt his boys were still in the game at that point. \nBut the third quarter started ominously. \nRivera took the ball seven times, finally finding paydirt on a 14-yard carry and a 22-0 second half lead. \nOak Grove didn’t score again until the fourth quarter when Fontenette took the ball 18 yards for a 29-0 lead to open the final frame. \nHe then scored on a 59-yard carry to officially put the game on ice. \nLive Oak must now regroup quickly to host a resurgent Pioneer team on Oct. 30 at Rickert Field. \nThe Mustangs have won three in a row after starting the season 0-4 and getting blown out in all four losses. \n“We still have to work. We’ve got three games to go 9-1 and that’s still our goal,” Gemo said. “We want to be 9-1 now. We’re going to look past this, try to get better and take the next three.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:40:16.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
