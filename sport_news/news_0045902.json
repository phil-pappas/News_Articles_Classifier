(AP) - A vehicle crashed into a crowd of spectators Saturday during the Oklahoma State University homecoming parade, causing multiple injuries, authorities said.\nOklahoma Highway Patrol Lt. John Vincent said he could provide no details about the incident Saturday morning in Stillwater except that multiple people were injured. Phone calls to Stillwater police and to Oklahoma State officials were not immediately returned.\nDave Kapple of Houston told the Stillwater News Press that he and his son were about 10 feet away when they saw the vehicle barreling into the crowd.\n\"We heard somebody scream, 'Look out!.' (He) plowed through a police motorcycle, and then a crowd of people,\" Kapple said. \"People were flying everywhere.\"\nKonda Walker, from Anchorage, Alaska, was attending the festivities ahead of the homecoming game between Oklahoma State and Kansas.\n\"At first we thought it was part of the show,\" Walker told the News Press. \"People were flying 30 feet into the air like rag dolls.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
