Now under the direction of former Coronado Head Coach Brad Talich , the Rattlers have a new attitude and a new star that has the team looking like a strong playoff threat with just one game remaining on the schedule. \nWith the Cimarron Spartans visiting, the Rattlers wasted no time putting their division foe away running out to 28-0 lead by the half with running back Ty'Shun McClinton scoring twice and quarterback Brannon Flowers accounting for two more scores. \nAlong the way, the Rattler defense dominated the mistake prone Spartan offense as they racked up less than 80-yards in the first half. \nThe second half saw a bevy of personal foul penalties as the aggressiveness of the Rattler defense saw tempers flair at times during the game but the Rattlers didn't take their foot off the pedal. McClinton opened the third quarter scoring with a 4-yard run that made the score 35-0 midway through the quarter. \nA Rattlers' special teams mistake allowed the Spartans to get on the board with a pass from backup quarterback Adrian Camberos but missed tackles and defensive mistakes would allow the Rattlers backups to continue to pull away. \nAthlete Brandon Peterson would add a 29-yard fourth quarter score and Dylan Andrews would add the final touches with a 4-yard score with just three minutes remaining to take a 49-7 win. \nThe Rattler defense held 1000-yard rusher Tyree Riley to less than 50-yards and the Spartans team to less than 165-total yards on the night. \nAt (6-2), the Rattlers move on the play Centennial (6-1) next week in the final game of the regular season as they seek a #2 playoff seed.<>The (1-6) Spartans move on to face the highly ranked Arbor View Aggies before preparing to close the regular season in a battle versus the Bonanza Bengals to take the final Northwest League playoff spot.
