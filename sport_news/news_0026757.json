All you want to do is make them proud.” Playing in the final Federal League game of her career Wednesday night, Wilson made four saves and the Polar Bears beat Lake 3-1 to finish a perfect conference season for a program that has won 20 league titles in 22 seasons. “Lately, more and more teams have more and more quality players,” Jackson coach Frank Gagliardi said of the Federal League. “They’re really recognizing strengths and weaknesses on both sides, and it’s making it much more challenging. So, it’s all that much more rewarding every year that goes by.” Jackson sophomore Brooke Parsons scored two goals and sophomore Lauren Hattery added a goal and an assist for Jackson (10-4-1, 6-0), which plays its final regular-season game Saturday before starting tournament play Oct. 22. “We’ve put in so many hours to this point where we don’t want to let each other down,” said Harold, the only returning starter from Jackson’s back line. “I think all of us through the club, we’ve ball-girled for these games and dreamed of playing under these lights.” Senior Lauren Aten scored for Lake with 16:22 left, cutting the Blue Streaks; deficit to 2-1. But Parsons put the game away with an unassisted goal with 8:30 left. Sophomore Autumn Schultz had four saves for the Blue Streaks (10-3-3, 3-2-1). “Hats off to other teams in the Federal League for upping their level,” Gagliardi said. “It’s fun for us to get to fight against teams that are coming out hungry to play the best they can and try to find a way to win.” When asked if he thinks Jackson has helped those teams raise their level, Gagliardi said, “Sure. You see that with all sports. Obviously, if you have one community that’s a little better, the other communities are like, ‘Man, we’ve got to find a way to overtake (them).’ It’s just general competitiveness and it makes it fun.” Reach Joe at 330-580-8573 or joe.scalzo @cantonrep.com.
