He is the captain of the team after being elected to the spot by his teammates. \nMontrose High School’s Dylan Atwood isn’t too concerned about where he plays on the football field, as long as he is on the field. \nAtwood, a 6-2, 175-pound senior has played defensive back, receiver and quarterback this year for the Indians, and that is just how he likes it. \n“I will play wherever they need me to, it doesn’t matter to me,” Atwood said. “I just want to help the team win.” \nMontrose head coach Jim Scarry said Atwood’s attitude is refreshing and somewhat unusual. \n“He was playing quarterback at the beginning of the season, but then when I told him I was moving him to receiver, his attitude was ‘whatever makes us a better team I will do,’” he said. “Too many kids would quit or make life difficult for the team, he put the team first and you just don’t see that much.” \nAtwood has been playing the sport since third grade flag football. He said his favorite position is safety on defense. \n“You can work out aggression because you get to hit people pretty hard, I like that,” he said. “It’s an important position because people can see it when you mess up, but maybe not when you do the right thing. But your teammates know and appreciate it, so that’s what counts.” \nScarry said Atwood is a natural on defense. \n“My favorite Dylan quote is ‘I just want to play defense and hit people,’” he said. “He has the right attitude about everything.” \nAtwood said the team this year is the best he’s been around. He said it’s because they are all close. \n“It’s been great, the seniors work with the sophomores and other underclassmen,” he said. “We are friends, we hang out together outside football. We have all been around coach awhile now and know his style and what he wants and can work together to make it right.” \nScarry said Atwood has the respect of his teammates. \n“It shows how much they like and respect him because this summer when captains were selected, his teammates selected him,” he said. “He cares about his teammates and it shows in everything he does, so it was an easy pick.” \nFootball is Atwood’s only athletic endeavor. He said after middle school, he decided to focus on football. \n“I like to hike, hunt and fish, but I’m not interested in any other sports,” he said. “My dad Cam coached me in fifth and sixth grade, and my mom Bridgette has always been involved. They are proud to watch me play.” \nScarry said Atwood can lull people to sleep with his demeanor. \n“He is so calm, but that just hides his competitive spirit,” he said. “He is one of the most competitive people I have been around. He just wants to do the the right thing and help us win.” \nAfter graduation, Atwood said his football career will be over. He has no plans to play at the college level. \n“I want to go to lineman school, my dad and grandpa both did that and have made pretty good money through their lives,” he said. “I’m not interested in playing in college, I would prefer to stay in the family business.” \nIn the classroom, Atwood likes English class best. \n“I like being able to express myself and be creative doing it,” he said. “A lot of people complain about English class, but I enjoy it. It’s something I can keep doing through life.” \nScarry said Atwood is also a great role model for younger players. \n“He’s a great young man, we never have any issues with behavior with him,” he said. “He’s a responsible young man and sets a great example for those around him.” \nAtwood said the Indians have some lofty goals for the season. \n“We want to win the league, if we play the best we can, we can do it. As seniors we want to play the best we can and have no regrets,” he said. “If we are playing our best and lose, we have to tip our hats to the other team and know they were better. But it’s upsetting to lose when we didn’t play our best, that makes losing a lot tougher and harder to forget.” ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:28:55.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
