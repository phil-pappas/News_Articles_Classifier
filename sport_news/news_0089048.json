The quality is there.” \nEffenberg won the last of his 35 caps for Germany in 1998 and has been working as a television pundit since retiring from football a decade ago. \nHaving jetted back to Germany from his home on sunny Mallorca and touched down in heavy snow in North Rhine-Westphalia, Effenberg said he would not have taken the job if he had any doubts Paderborn could avoid a second relegation in as many seasons. \n“I signed with full conviction. I wouldn’t be here if I was not convinced of success,” said Effenberg, who helped Bayern win the Champions League in 2001. \nWilfried Finke, president of Paderborn, said he was delighted when he heard Effenberg was interested in replacing Markus Gellhaus, who was sacked after last week's 1-0 defeat to Duisburg. \n“As the name Effenberg came to me, I was downright euphoric,” beamed Finke. \n“Not many footballers in Germany have his quality. He is the right coach at the right time. Only Alpha types are able to guide a group.” \nEffenberg, whose team are just one place above the relegation spots, has wasted no time and took training this afternoon while his first match will be at home against fourth-placed Eintracht Braunschweig on Friday evening. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:53:50.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
