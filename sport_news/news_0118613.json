If they do that someone else will be free and will have more chances to do something for us. \n“Playing as a No 9 is not something that I am used to, but if the manager asks me to do it I will do. I don’t have a lot of experience there but I have played everywhere in my career. You have one game where you play good on the right and another good on the left. \nThe skillful forward is excited for his winning goal against Sevilla in the Champions League clash midweek but says the focus is now on the Super Sunday derby. \n“I am happy with the goal against Sevilla because it gives us a little advantage going into the final three games of the Champions League group. \n“But a derby is a completely different game, it’s something special. Hopefully we can play a good game and win over there because it is one of the main goals for the supporters also. \n“Derbies are the same everywhere. I think whether they are here, in Belgium or Germany, If you can win this one for the supporters they will be very happy and they will talk about it for half a season until the next game. It is a big deal for them,” the Belgian said. \nCity are currently topping the table with United in third, behind Arsenal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:44:40.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
