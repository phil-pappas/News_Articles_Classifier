It was also Tarnowski's third career 300-yard passing game. \nTarnowski, a graduate of North Royalton, is 15-2 as a starter. He has thrown for 4,069 yards (sixth all-time at AU), 33 touchdowns (fourth all-time) and just 10 interceptions in 17 games. \nDespite Ashland's success, Saturday's game against Northern Michigan is not easy. Three Wildcats are in the top five in the GLIAC in their respective categories. \nMarcus Tucker is tied for second in receiving touchdowns (6), Shaye Brown ranks third in passing yards per game (275) and fifth in touchdowns (16). On defense, L.J. Liston ranks first in the conference and is 12th among Division II players in tackles per game with 12. \nIn a Division II game on Thursday night, Notre Dame College defeated West Liberty, 59-51. \nIn Division III, Hiram (1-5) will attempt to continue one streak and stop another when it plays host to Wittenberg (4-2) at 1 p.m. Saturday. \nHiram won its first game of the season last week. The Terriers, however, have not defeated Wittenberg in 15 tries.
