For the first time in roughly forever, the Crimson Tide were a very slight underdog. It was finally Georgia’s time. Yeah, about all of that. The Crimson Tide scored two touchdowns in 60 seconds late in the first half to turn a slog through heavy rain into a rout. Bama’s defense stuffed Georgia. And perhaps most important for the Tide’s bigger picture, Jake Coker made several big plays, including a 45-yard touchdown pass late in the first half that stretched the lead to 24-3 and set the rout in motion. If Alabama is growing a quarterback, it’s very possible the Tide is set up for another long run toward the College Football Playoff. Alabama rolled all over Georgia in the first half \nWHAT WE’LL BE TALKING ABOUT: Georgia wasn’t ready for the big stage. Again. Going into the game, the talk was that the emergence of transfer quarterback Greyson Lambert had completed a lineup without obvious deficits on either side of the ball. But when Georgia struggled to run, Lambert wasn’t good enough to bail the Bulldogs out. He wasn’t good, period — he was yanked before halftime. At least mathematically, The Bulldogs are still the favorites to win the SEC East, which would get them to the SEC championship game and another shot on a big stage — possibly against Alabama. But if Georgia doesn’t get better quarterback play, that kind of talk is wholly unnecessary. Lambert had been very efficient, but he was only 7-for-17 for 70 yards, missed badly several times and looked overwhelmed as the first half wore on. Brice Ramsey’s first pass of the second half was a pick-six. Their performances don’t bode well for rebounding, at least not to a championship level. \nTHE DECIDING PLAY: Up 17-3 after a blocked punt for a touchdown late in the second quarter, Alabama forced a quick three-and-out, took possession near midfield — and went for the jugular. Jake Coker faked a handoff to Derrick Henry, then threw deep, where freshman receiver Calvin Ridley had gotten behind everybody. The 45-yard touchdown pass stretched the Crimson Tide’s lead to 24-3. It was Alabama’s second score in less than a minute of game action, and with Georgia’s offense stagnant, it was a decisive moment. Almost got ugly pre game. Alabama and Georgia players barking.
