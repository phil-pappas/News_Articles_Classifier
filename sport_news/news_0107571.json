The bowlers suffered through the game, but the worst was reserved for the Batting Powerplay, which was usually taken in the overs 36-40 — in these five overs, no more than three fielders could be placed outside the circle. Thus, from over 36 to 50, the batsmen had a terrific blast, making the game extremely lopsided, especially on the flatter pitches of India. Since 2012, of all the ODI series in India, the bowlers were most severely punished when Australia toured India for six One-dayers in 2013. India scaled the barrier of 350 runs in three of their five completed innings; Australia got past 350 on two occasions. Nine centuries were made, including a double century by Rohit Sharma. In the last 10 overs, Australia scored at 8.59 an over when they batted all those 10 overs; India’s scoring rate was 12.5 in the games they batted all overs from 41 to 50. Australia’s overall run rate in overs 41-50 (including innings they batted only a few of the last 10 overs) was 8.72; India’s corresponding scoring rate was 9.72. The ICC has changed the rules again — the Batting Powerplay has been done away with, and up to five fielders can now be placed outside the 30-yard circle in the last ten overs. The effects of the change are obvious. Bowlers make comeback\nIn the four games of the current series against South Africa, both teams have scored at a run-rate of 5.48. In their last 10 overs, India have made the runs at an average of 7.70, which is much lower than the 9.72 they logged against Australia two years ago. South Africa, similarly, have scored much fewer runs in the last 10 overs than Australia did, at a run rate of 7.76 against Australia’s 8.72. Thus, only once in the eight innings has 300 been topped during the current series, that too due to an extraordinary knock of 104 off 73 balls by AB de Villiers in the first match of the series. After India’s win in Chennai yesterday, Dhoni confirmed that the rule changes have had a huge effect on the ability of the batsmen to score fast. A score of 300 had become easily chaseable since 2012, but the new rules have made 300 a defendable total again. “Now as we are seeing in the 40th to 50th (overs), it’s not easy just to go in and slam big shots and get 80-90 runs,” Dhoni said. “You’ll see most of the sides saying, ‘Last 10, if you are chasing, you shouldn’t have more than 65 runs or 70 runs’. That also you have to have a good day.” Dhoni said that these numbers could vary according to the conditions at the ground and the skill of the bowlers. “But on a good day, when they are bowling well, it will be very difficult to get something like 80 or 90 in 10 overs. That used to be the case with the previous rules,” he said. In the series against Australia in 2013, it was normal to see over 80 runs scored in the last 10 overs — Australia made 80, 122 and 99 in the last 10 overs of different ODIs then, and India scored 99 and 151 in the two innings they played all of their last 10 overs. The difference after the new rules is remarkable – India have made 84, 82, 77 and 69 in the last 10 overs of the four matches in this series. South Africa have made 109, 60 and 64 in the three innings they batted all 10 of overs 41-50. The ICC had forced the bowlers to cede ground to the batsmen since October 2012. After the recent rule change, the early data suggest that the situation has been set right to an extent. This can be only good for the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:15:54.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
