Pic/Getty Images \nThe Gunners have yet to pick a up single point in European competition following defeats by Dinamo Zagreb and Olympiakos this season.\nBut they are going well in the Premier League, with Saturday's victory, courtesy of goals from Alexis Sanchez, substitute Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey, lifting them back into second spot.\n\"For me the important game was today,\" Wenger said. \"Because I knew that first of all that to win today was vital to stay in touch with the top teams.\n\"Secondly, the best way for us to prepare for Tuesday night was to win the game.\"\nWenger opted to play his strongest side against Watford, who matched Arsenal until Sanchez broke the deadlock in the 62nd minute to record his tenth goal in just six games for club and country.\nAnd those players will, in the main, start against the German champions at the Emirates Stadium in the first instalment of a back-to-back double-header.\n\"There is no obvious reason to completely change the team,\" Wenger added. \"There might be some, I don't know yet, I will have to see how completely everyone recovers.\n\"I was able to rest a little early Mesut Ozil and Sanchez. We have of course to put pace into the Bayern game. We are playing against a big team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:13:33.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
