And fortunately for them, there was no particular rush to process it.\nThe Bears do not play this weekend, a welcome break in the schedule that allows them to recuperate and take stock of a 2-4 start that includes a pair of fourth-quarter comeback wins and an array of growing pains.\n\"I like where the locker room is,\" Cutler said Sunday with the pain of defeat still fresh. \"Obviously it's a loss, but no one is too down right now. We'll get re-energized for the second half.\"\nThe team practiced Tuesday before lightning interrupted the session, and they'll do so again Wednesday. Then players have a four-day break before returning Monday to begin preparing for the Vikings' Nov. 1 visit to Soldier Field.\nThe coaching staff will exhale as well, while examining how the team can ascend over the final 10 games. Coach John Fox offered few specifics Monday, other than including red-zone offense in the list of areas under the microscope.\n\"We'll self-scout some things â€¦ we want to present to the players and what we want to do to improve it in all three phases,\" Fox said.\nThe list is substantial, given the Bears' record and some stats that reflect a team in the nascent stages of Fox's program.\nOn offense, the Bears rank 28th in the NFL in yards per play (5.07). Injuries have been a major hindrance, particularly the strained hamstring that cost Cutler a game and a half and the hamstring injury that sidelined No. 1 receiver Alshon Jeffery for four.\nThose injuries reinforced the Bears' commitment to the run. They rank 24th in yards per carry (3.86) but 14th in rushing yards per game (112) because of how consistently they've fed Matt Forte, the NFL's rushing leader with 507 rushing yards.\nAgainst the Lions, though, Forte was limited to 69 yards on 24 carries behind an offensive line missing injured first-string left tackle Jermon Bushrod and center Will Montgomery.\nRight tackle Kyle Long was openly self-critical about run blocks he missed, saying that will be a focus for him and the line during the off week.\n\"We have to get better at football,\" he said Tuesday after practice.\n\"There's nobody that we're preparing for, necessarily, but we can self-scout and we can figure out where we're struggling in terms of technique and assignment. We took an opportunity today in individual (drills) as an offensive line to do some things that maybe we need some shoring up on.\"\nThe Bears' run-heavy, ball-control identity helped minimize the defense's exposure through the first five games. On Sunday, Jeffrey's return and the Lions' stout front pushed the Bears more toward the passing game.\nThe offense's No. 9 ranking in time of possession helps explains the disparity between the Bears' total defense ranking (ninth) and where they rank in yards allowed per play (25th).\nFrom a personnel standpoint, outside linebacker Pernell McPhee and defensive lineman Jarvis Jenkins, free agents whom general manager Ryan Pace signed in March, have emerged as effective defenders in the new scheme. They lead the team with four and 31/2 sacks, respectively.\n\"We're going to get it rolling,\" linebacker Sam Acho said. \"We know we have something special. We believe in each other. A game like (the Lions) doesn't change what we know we can do.\"\nCultivating that sense of belief could be the Bears' most important accomplishment to this point. It at least will be a key component of what propels them forward.\nCoat note: The team on Monday kicked off its 27th annual coat drive.
