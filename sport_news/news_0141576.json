He could enter the game as part of a double switch or come off the bench. \nThe Dodgers want to see what Puig can do before they establish their roster for the playoffs, which begin next Friday against the New York Mets. \nPuig has been limited to 77 games this season because of injuries. He is hitting .256 with 38 RBIs and 11 home runs. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:15:55.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
