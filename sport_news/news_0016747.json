(AP) - Patrick Mahomes threw for 359 yards and a score, De'Andre Washington rushed for 160 yards and a TD and Texas Tech held off a late-charging, winless Kansas team 30-20 on Saturday.\nThe Red Raiders (5-2, 2-2 Big 12) racked up 225 yards rushing and a touchdown on the ground. Texas Tech's 30 points were the least amount the team has scored all season.\nFive different Texas Tech offensive playmakers recorded over 50 yards receiving. Zach Austin led the Red Raiders with 80 yards receiving, Jakeem Grant had 76 yards, Devin Lauderdale had 50, Cameron Batson, 58, and Reginald Davis, 57 yards and a score.\nTexas Tech continued its streak of perfection, as the Red Raiders are 9-0 inside Memorial Stadium, a record dating to 1966.\nKansas (0-6, 0-3) is riding a nine-game losing streak and is 0-6 for the first time since 1988.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
