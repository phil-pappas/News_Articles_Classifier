(AP) - A suburban Chicago garden with a disappointing rainforest plant that refused to bloom now has a new star attraction.\nThe Chicago Botanic Garden announced Tuesday that a second corpse flower is not only on display in its semi-tropical greenhouse, but it is blooming.\nGarden officials say the smell is a combination of Limburger cheese, garlic, rotting fish and smelly feet.\nVisitors have been flocking to the garden to see the plant as it blooms. The garden is live-streaming the titan arum plant on its website (www.chicagobotanic.org/titan_arum_corpse_flower ).\nThis plant has been nicknamed Alice. In August, another corpse flower, nicknamed Spike, didn't open after much anticipation. Garden scientists finally opened the flower manually.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:00:25.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
