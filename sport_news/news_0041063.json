Around 500 nationals are thought to be in Syria or Iraq, 133 of which have died.\nA hotline set up for families to report radicalisation in April 2014 has drawn more than 3,000 alerts, 23 percent of which concern minors -- most of them girls.\nThis week France also launched a series of television, Internet and newspaper adverts in which parents and siblings of those who have lost children to terrorist organizations recount their tales.\n*The story was edited by Ahram Online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:27:32.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
