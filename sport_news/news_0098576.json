Because it's in for a big test on Monday night. \nThe Chargers host the Pittsburgh Steelers , trying to win their second straight game and go to 3-0 at Qualcomm Stadium. \nThree key Chargers defensive backs continue to practice after being out of Sunday's win over the Browns. \nCornerback Brandon Flowers left with a concussion. Jason Verrett, the other starting cornerback, was a late scratch with a foot injury. Strong safety Jahleel Addae (ankle) missed his third straight outing. \nWithout them, the Browns' Josh McCown threw for 356 yards against the Chargers. \nFlowers was a full participant in Friday's practice. Verrett and Addae were limited. \nSteelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger isn't expected to play because of a knee injury. But his favorite targets will be active. \n\"It is going to be a really big challenge to stop them,\" Flowers said. \"Everyone knows about Antonio Brown and that he's a great playmaker.\" \nBrown is tied with Atlanta's Julio Jones with an NFL-best 478 receiving yards. Brown in second in the league with 34 receptions and also has two touchdown catches. \nThe Steelers will lean on running back Le'Veon Bell, but the Chargers are cognizant of their receiving options, even without Roethlisberger. \nMichael Vick replaces Roethlisberger and he'll be looking for Brown, Martavis Bryant and Darrius Heyward-Bey. \n\"But we're getting healthy and getting some guys back,\" Flowers said. \"We're ready to go.\" \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:27:57.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
