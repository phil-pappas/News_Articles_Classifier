(AP) - Energy officials say this winter shouldn't be as punishing on New Hampshire consumers as the harsh 2013-14 heating season.\nAt the New Hampshire Energy Summit on Monday, Robert Scott, a commissioner with the state Public Utilities Commission, said all energy providers have submitted rates that are from 8.6 percent to 40 percent cheaper than last year.\nIn the winter of 2013-14, Scott said state consumers spent about $5 billion more than a benchmark the state uses to compare seasons. This year, he expects that number will be about $1.3 billion.\nSeveral factors affect consumer costs: Gas pipeline capacity, the cost and availability of other fuels, weather and demand.\nNew England pays more than other regions for electricity: Compared to New York state, it's 88 percent more expensive in New England.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
