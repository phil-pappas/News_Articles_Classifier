Coach John Fox doesn't appear to have any objections to having fifth-round pick Adrian Amos and undrafted Harold Jones-Quartey on the field Sunday against the Chiefs. \"This thing is about playing good,\" Fox said. \"We're kind of performance-based. There's really no limitations, eligibility-wise, whether you're a first-year or a 12th-year guy. It's just about how you perform. \"The young guys have worked hard at their craft and got us out of the game. We've got a time frame here to get prepared for the Kansas City Chiefs. We'll get to see how that test goes on Sunday.\" Amos has started all four games, but Jones-Quartey was signed just over a month ago after he was waived by the Arizona Cardinals. Both are 22. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio was a bit more critical of Jones-Quartey. \"Harold came in and played in the game, and he's an option,\" Fangio said, but added, \"He needs more practice. But, in defense of him, he hasn't been getting a lot of (practice) reps. \"Anytime you have to play this early in the season, and you weren't in the off-season and training camp, you're behind the 8-ball, and he was behind the 8-ball. But he survived. There were plays that he could have played better and should have played better, and hopefully now with a week's practice, he'll do better.\" Just for kicks: Punter Pat O'Donnell is the holder for Robbie Gould's kicks, but he missed last week's game with a knee injury. Spencer Lanning filled in for O'Donnell last week and handled the holding duties as well. But quarterback Jay Cutler practiced during the week as the emergency holder. \"It's a different dynamic back there, especially in Soldier Field with the wind,\" Cutler said. \"I've got to throw it, (but) a 49-yard kick to win games in that kind of wind, that's some kind of pressure. \"He doesn't flinch. He goes out there each and every week in some of the toughest conditions. And our field -- I'm not going to get into the field -- but our field isn't in top shape, and for him to go out there and do what he does, it's impressive to say the least.\" Gould is known as a perfectionist, but Cutler said he was laid-back in practice. \"He wasn't picky with me,\" the quarterback said. \"He was just, 'Get it down. I'll kick it. I'll handle it.' So I think I did an OK job.\" So, is Cutler the backup holder? \"Yeah,\" he said, \"if there is one.\" Get well soon: Another day, anther name on the injury list. Thursday's injury report was one worse than Wednesday's, which included 13 players. Quarterback Jay Cutler (hamstring), offensive tackle Kyle Long, (back/ankle), wide receiver Alshon Jeffery (hamstring), defensive linemen Jeremiah Ratliff (ankle) and Will Sutton (elbow), linebacker Shea McClellin (elbow), cornerback Alan Ball (groin) and punter Pat O'Donnell (knee) were all limited for the second straight day, and offensive tackle Tayo Fabuluje (ankle) was added to that group. Cornerback Sherrick McManis (hamstring), who did not practice Wednesday, was limited. Wide receiver Eddie Royal (ankle), offensive tackle Jermon Bushrod (concussion), guard Patrick Omameh (ankle) and safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) did not practice for the second straight day. For the Chiefs, linebacker Josh Mauga (groin/Achilles) did not practice and wide receiver Albert Wilson (shoulder) was limited. Back for more: Linebacker John Timu, who was waived on Tuesday, was signed to the practice squad Thursday. He appeared in the first four games on special teams.
