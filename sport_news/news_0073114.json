(“Umbrage” in the St. Louis dialect apparently means calling me a “#*$&-gurgling gutter *$&#.”)\nAt about the same time as aspersions were being cast my way, some interesting, 100-percent real news was coming out of St. Louis and spreading around the world.\nPer the Associated Press , and I swear this is absolutely true:\n“Beneath the surface of a St. Louis-area landfill lurk two things that should never meet: a slow-burning fire and a cache of Cold War-era nuclear waste, separated by no more than 1,200 feet.\n“Government officials have quietly adopted an emergency plan in case the smoldering embers ever reach the waste, a potentially ‘catastrophic event’ that could send up a plume of radioactive smoke over a densely populated area near the city's main airport.”\nThe Cubs returned to Wrigley on Oct. 11, 2015, for a little brunch, Bears and batting practice.\nThat’s right. There’s a garbage fire underneath St. Louis and it’s creeping close enough to a landfill full of radioactive waste that an emergency plan has been put together.\nHorrible Garbage City doesn’t seem so far-fetched now, does it, people who sent me emails with the subject line, “Your an idiot”?\nThe AP story continued: “The cause of the fire is unknown. For years, the most immediate concern has been an odor created by the smoldering.”\nLook, there’s nothing funny about nuclear contamination or a city being at risk because there is literally flaming garbage underneath its surface. So even though the fact(ish) things in my column were above reproach (I don’t know what “reproach” means), I’d like to extend an olive branch to Cardinals fans.\nTheir beloved team is in Chicago and will face off against the Cubs tonight at Wrigley Field in Game 3 of the series. With the series tied 1-1, this is a critical game for both teams.\nAs Cubs face Cardinals, a VERY TRUE history of St. Louis, aka 'Horrible Garbage City' Rex W. Huppke As the Chicago Cubs get ready for their first-ever postseason matchup against the St. Louis Cardinals, it would be easy to roll out the classic newspaper columnist ploy of picking a fight with residents of the opposing team’s town.\nIt’s a cheesy, overplayed bit where a writer with no fresh ideas...\nAs the Chicago Cubs get ready for their first-ever postseason matchup against the St. Louis Cardinals, it would be easy to roll out the classic newspaper columnist ploy of picking a fight with residents of the opposing team’s town.\nIt’s a cheesy, overplayed bit where a writer with no fresh ideas...\n(Rex W. Huppke) I want the Cubs to win, of course, but I want the Cardinals and any fans up from St. Louis to feel good and comfortable. So I have a simple request for all Cubs fans who will be attending the game, as well as anyone who will be in the Wrigleyville area: Please try to smell as nice as possible.\nShower before the game and then lay the deodorant and perfume or cologne on thick. Steer clear of any garbage and keep the area around your seats as tidy as possible.\nConsider stuffing your pockets with aromatic potpourri or wearing fashionable air fresheners around your neck. Avoid flatulence-producing food before and during the game, and if you must pass gas, do it into your Cubs hat and then place it back on your head until you get home later.\nThe Cardinals players and St. Louis fans in the stands will undoubtedly appreciate the refreshing scent and, since the area around the ballpark usually smells like a fraternity house ate a group of drunk, sweaty 30-somethings and then barfed them out onto the street, all Chicago residents within a one-mile radius will be grateful as well.\nPutting our freshest-smelling foot forward seems like the least we can do to welcome the St. Louisians who are here taking a break from their underground garbage fire. After all, it seems like they’ve got a lot more to worry about than just a baseball game.\nrhuppke@tribpub.com\n St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Cubs Wrigley Field National League", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617c419/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-huppke-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561aa33e/turbine/chi-ct-cubs-workout04-ct0031637632-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb753/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-wrigley-huppke-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561b0759/turbine/chi-ct-cubs-workout05-ct0031637644-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bddd7/turbine/ct-photos-brunch-batting-practice-wrigley-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:28:50.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
