No Checkdown Charlie. Athletic, yet without the dangers of a gunslinger mentality. There are mistakes. True. Still, he has the looks of being a keeper. \nThe Bills bought in to their young quarterback before the season started, giving him the No. 1 job, then showed even more confidence dealing away veteran backup Matt Cassel. The rest of the league is finding out what Rex Ryan already suspected when the Bills signed him in the off-season after Taylor spent his first four years behind Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco in Baltimore. \nTaylor is an athletic beast. \nAnd this week, it’s the Giants’ turn to puzzle over a way to stop him, with coach Tom Coughlin noting Taylor can hurt a defence with both his arm and his legs. \nThrough three games, Taylor’s completion percentage has soared to 74.4 with seven touchdowns, three interceptions, and a passer rating of 116.1. Buffalo is third in scoring at 33.3 points per game. Taylor also averages 5.6 yards per rush, including plays of 31 and 26 yards. \n“Outstanding quarterback ... also a running threat,” Coughlin said. “He has a 74% completion percentage and does an outstanding job with the deep ball. A lot of play-action, a lot of movement, a lot of bootleg, a lot of great perimeter. He is a force to have to defend.” \nThe Giants will again be without Robert Ayers, out with a hamstring injury, which isn’t going to make it any easier to contain Taylor. \n“He’s real dynamic,” the defensive end said. “And he doesn’t play like this is his first time being a full-time starter, for sure. He has a lot of weapons at his disposal, and he has a good defence to depend on and lean on, so he can just play comfortable ... the team believes in him.” \nNone of this comes as a surprise to Giants defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo who, when he was with the Ravens, lobbied to get Taylor to play on his Baltimore defence. \n“He was the best athlete on that team,” Spagnuolo said. “He just had fun, and now he’s taken that into his starting role in Buffalo. I’m happy for him. I don’t want him to do too good this Sunday, but I’m happy for him. He could have done anything. I kept trying to get him to play safety or corner. Every day. And he was smart enough to know he was a quarterback.” \nCAUGHT SHORT \nWell, it was nice while it lasted. \nThe Steelers didn’t just lose a game Thursday, wide receiver Antonio Brown also had one of the most impressive records in NFL history scuttled. \nBlame it on Ben Roethlisberger. Sort of. The two have been like Batman and Robin, like Mantle and Maris, like ham and cheese. One, without the other, just isn’t the same. So with Roethlisberger sidelined against the Ravens, Brown’s streak of 35 consecutive regular-season games with at least five catches and 50 yards ended. \nBrown and backup Michael Vick just didn’t have the same chemistry. When the timing did click, Brown had a deep end-zone pass slip through his fingers. He finished with five catches for 42 yards in a 23-20 overtime loss. \nFOOTBALL GEOGRAPHY 101 \nThe NFL is considering widening its field next season. \nNo, it’s not converting to the CFL way of thinking. The field they’re thinking about is the marketing one. \nThe playing field is just fine the way it is. But the NFL Network reports that games could be played in Mexico and Germany next season, with the schedule in London ramping up to four games. \nA game in Mexico City in 2005 drew more than 100,000 fans. \n“We feel good about the U.K., but the idea of moving forward with other countries is attractive, too,” said Mark Waller, in charge of the league’s international expansion. \nThere is a way to get 100,000 fans to a game in Toronto, too. But you’d have to promise people that the halftime entertainment would include a Maple Leafs game. \nTHE HURT LOCKERS \nWashington receiver DeSean Jackson complained about a “smear campaign” run by the Eagles when they released him in 2014. So its even more disappointing that he’ll miss Sunday’s game with a twitchy hamstring against his former team ... The Giants will be without receiver Victor Cruz but there’s a chance left tackle Ereck Flowers could play ... Arian Foster and left tackle Duane Brown will be game-time decisions for the Texans ... The Jets brought wide receiver Eric Decker (knee), who had 10 catches for 134 yards and two touchdowns in the first two weeks, to London, suggesting he might play against Miami ... Cornerback Darrelle Revis (hamstring) will play ... Dolphins will be without Branden Albert at left tackle ... Bears’ left tackle Jermon Bushrod (shoulder) is out, while Jay Cutler and receiver Alshon Jeffery remain questionable ... LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins will sit out for the Bills ... Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly is out against the Buccaneers but running backs Jonathan Stewart and Mike Tolbert were back at practice on Friday. \nQUICK HITS \nThe Eagles-Redskins game will be played as scheduled now that Hurricane Joaquin has turned away from the U.S. coast ... The biggest news for the Saints is that Drew Brees is expected to start at quarterback. However, just as valuable to a defence that has allowed 397 yards a game is the return of cornerback Keenan Lewis and safety Jairus Byrd ... Former Seattle running back Christine Michael took first-team reps with Dallas this week and is expected to get a chance to play, perhaps this week against the Saints.
