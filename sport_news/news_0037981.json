September 29th 2015 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/More Sports/ A QUARTER of Jarryd Hayne’s debut NFL season is already in the books. \nAfter the crazy highs of the preseason, Hayne’s performances have become more what you’d expect from a punt returner on a San Francisco team that has struggled to a 1-3 record. \nHe’s produced one memorable highlight, made an error or two but largely been prevented from ripping off the big plays we saw with regularity during the trial games. But it’s no surprise. This is the NFL. Teams don’t just hand out opportunities for dangerous opposition players to wreak havoc. \nPerhaps the most frustrating trend across the opening four games has been Hayne’s decreased role in the 49ers offence. His offensive snap count has dropped each week — from 10 in a week one win against Minnesota to none in Monday’s 17-3 defeat against the Packers. \nBut let’s continue to celebrate this for what it is. An Aussie rugby league star who had never played American football before is the starting punt returner for an NFL team. He has one of the highest selling jerseys in the league. Magic freaking Johnson knows who he is . This is an unabated success story. \nWEEK ONE — SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 20 MINNESOTA VIKINGS 3 Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:50:46.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
