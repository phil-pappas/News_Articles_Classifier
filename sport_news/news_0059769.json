I thought we did that. Two, push the ball, and defensively, I thought we did a good job of communicating. Through those first three quarters, I thought we did those things, and you could see, with our transition, how we pushed the ball. You only can do those things when you get stops, and I thought we did a great job of that. \n\"Obviously, we didn't make a lot of shots today. They're long and they outrebounded us. It wasn't by much, but like I said, we thought we did a good job of hitting those goals. Obviously, you want to win, and that's a goal we didn't reach, but we did a good job of competing. Effort was one. We didn't think we had great effort last night, and I think we exceeded that tonight with how we played.\" \nIn a game marred by 51 fouls, the Cavaliers found themselves at the free-throw line for 44 attempts, and they knocked down 35 of those shots. \n\"For us, it was important to attack to the basket, and it showed,\" Williams said. \"We were in the bonus early and often. That was a point of emphasis, and I thought we did a good job of getting to the line. Even I shot free throws and I don't get to the line too much. \n\"It was probably was ugly to y'all, but it felt pretty good to us. Every game takes on its own identity, and this one was no different. You've got to go out and play the game.\" \nIn addition to accomplishing most of the team's goals, Williams believes the Cavaliers have a better understanding of the who the Bucks are and what type of systems they use on both sides of the floor, which will come in handy as the Central Division foes will face off four times during the regular season. \n\"They're going to be a good team,\" Williams said. \"They're long. They switch a lot. In preseason, I don't think coaching changes. Players may change, but coaches stay the same, the style, what they're going to run. I think more for us, when we see them again, we know they're going to switch and get into our counters. \n\"They're a long defensive team. They're a good defensive team, but preseason is just getting in your rhythm, executing, doing things to get better each and every day, and I thought we took some steps in the right direction.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RGHqX7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:18:22.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
