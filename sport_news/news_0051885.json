By Seattle Times staff The Associated Press and Fort Worth Star-Telegram \nTORONTO – Backup infielder Hanser Alberto singled home the go-ahead run in the 14th inning and the Texas Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-4 Friday for a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five American League Division Series. \nThe underdog Rangers will return home and try to sweep the Blue Jays in Game 3 Sunday. Martin Perez will start for Texas against Marco Estrada. \nReliever Keone Kela, a graduate of Chief Sealth High School in Seattle who also played at Everett Community College, was the winning pitcher. He stayed relatively calm after a dust-up with Toronto slugger Josh Donaldson that led to the benches and bullpens emptying. \nThey exchanged heated words after Donaldson sent a deep foul down the left-field line. Kela struck him out and got Edwin Encarnacion with a deep fly to the wall in center to end the 13th inning.

He delivered an RBI single with two outs in the 14th, and DeShields followed with an infield hit for another run.
