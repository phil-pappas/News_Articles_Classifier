He also ran for 142 yards and a TD on 14 carries. \nDuring one fourth-quarter keeper, Cummins hurdled a would-be Franklin tackler, drawing oohs and aahs from both sides of the field. \nThe Chargers scored first on their opening possession when Cummins capped a five-play, 50-yard drive with a 6-yard keeper. Matt Pachota's extra-point made it 7-0. \nThe Patriots were seemingly stymied on their next drive, facing a fourth-and-10 from the Churchill 39. \nFranklin quarterback Denzel Adams gets dragged down from behind by Churchill’s Sean Stenzel.

A mishandled snap on the extra point left the score at 13-7. \nThe most exciting play of the night that didn't count occurred on Franklin's next possession when Adams scrambled for what seemed like a half hour, before hitting tight end Rob Erwin in the left flat. \nAs soon as Erwin headed upfield, he bulldozed a Charger defender before finally getting dragged down in the Chargers' red zone. An illegal-man-downfield infraction against Franklin brought the play back, but Erwin's play seemed to ignite a flame in the Patriots. \nThe Patriots' grabbed a 14-13 lead (following Jake Giacobbi's second extra point of the night) with 5:20 left in the first half when Jacob Clark scored from five yards out – one play after Chris Nehasil rumbled 67 yards on a jet sweep. \nTo keep the game's ping-pong theme intact, Churchill then regained the lead, 19-14, when Cummins hit a diving Mike Hill on a 26-yard scoring pass (the two-point conversion pass was no good). \nFranklin cut its halftime deficit to 19-17 13 seconds before halftime when Giacobbi split the uprights on a 37-yard field goal. \nThe second half, which was more wild than the first, got rolling when Binkiewicz found pay dirt from 15 yards out to give his team a 24-19 lead. \nThe Chargers responded at the 8:25 mark of the third quarter when Cummins hit a streaking Jamal Allen for a 50-yard TD pass. Allen then ran in the two-point conversion to give the visitors a 27-24 lead. \nChurchill's defense managed to keep Denzel Adams (red jersey) in check for most of the night, but the senior quarterback made enough plays to win.

Ke-Mauri Heard had a significant sack to thwart another Churchill fourth-quarter threat. \newright@hometownlife.com 124 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.hometownlife.com/story/sports/2015/10/10/livonia-franklin-football-team-defeats-churchill-43-27/73720222/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:58:31.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
