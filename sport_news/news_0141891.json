Week 9 prep football final scores \n“The last three games we’ve really taken off with rushing the ball,” Lees said. “We stayed patient and the kids ran hard. (Running a lot) isn’t what we are used to in the past, but at this point, if it is a win that is what we need.” \nThe Jags’ backfield showcased a “two-headed” beast with Marquise Ross (two TDs) and Jaelyn Allen (one TD) breaking tackles all night in the win. \n“I thought the outside runs were working for us tonight,” Ross said. “We had to see what the defense was doing first, then we had to adjust. \n“It’s good to get this district win. It gives us a lot of confidence. When we play on the road, we know we gotta represent for our school and play our hardest.” \nDefensively, the Jaguars were challenged with stopping one of the area’s top recruits, QB Cody Saunders – who is committed to the University of West Virginia. \nSaunders averages 190 passing yards per game, 106.8 rushing yards per game and a couple of touchdowns. \nWest Florida responded well to the challenge, sacking Saunders six times – three by Adarius McWilliams – and limiting Arnold’s big plays. \nThough West Florida created a 14-3 lead at halftime, the Marlins surged in the second half to cut the lead close. \nIn the first drive of the fourth quarter, Saunders capped off an Arnold drive with a short TD run and the Marlins followed it up with a two-point conversion to cut the lead to 21-11. \nWith 2:18 to play, Saunders found Trever Kilcrease on a slant for a 5-yard TD to make it a three-point game. \nThe Jags recovered the onside kick, and pounded the ball with Allen and Ross before kneeling out the clock. \n“We knew it was gonna be close, every game Arnold has played in has come down to the wire,” Lees said. “I’m so proud of our kids. Our defense played hard.” \nArnold fighting to keep chances alive Now on WF 5 yard line 2:30 to play in regulation WF leads 21-11 (Photo: Brian Achatz/bachatz@pnj.com) \nWest Florida dads having some fun out here in PCB.
