FILE - In this March 1, 2009, file photo, then-Louisville's Andre McGee pretends to have trouble hearing the cheers of fans after scoring during the second half of their NCAA college basketball game against Marquette in Louisville, Ky. Escort Katina Powell says she has no proof that Louisville coach Rick Pitino knew that a former Cardinals staffer hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with former recruits and players. But Powell said Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015, on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that with “a boatload” of recruits and dancers, “loud music, alcohol, security, cameras” in a campus dormitory and others aware of the shows, “how could he not know?” In her first interview since the release of her book earlier this month, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" Powell says that the coach had to be aware of some of 22 shows she alleges that former staffer Andre McGee paid and took place in the players’ Billy Minardi Hall campus dormitory from 2010-14.
