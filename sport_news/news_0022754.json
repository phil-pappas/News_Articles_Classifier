He and the Redskins hope to gain a better understanding about his availability for the following game some time next week, coach Jay Gruden said. \nKerrigan, who fractured the bone late in the first quarter of Sunday’s win over the Bucs and did not return, will have a follow-up visit next week. There’s a chance that the linebacker will be able to play on Nov. 8 when Washington returns from the bye week for a road game against New England, Gruden said. If he’s able to play, Kerrigan will wear some kind of cast, his coach expects. \nMeanwhile, the statuses of cornerback Bashaud Breeland, linebacker Keenan Robinson and other injured teammates remain unknown for now. \nBreeland strained a hamstring while running down running back Doug Martin to prevent a touchdown late in the fourth quarter. Gruden said, “there’s some concern there,” but added that the second-year cornerback will be monitored on a day-to-day basis. \nRobinson is believed to have suffered a “slightly fractured” rib, according to Gruden. Gruden was optimistic that Robinson, who left the game late in the first quarter, but returned in the second half and finished the game, would be fine to play in the next game. \nLinebacker Perry Riley Jr. left the game with a lower leg strain and is day-to-day. \nMeanwhile, cornerbacks Chris Culliver (knee) and DeAngelo Hall (toe), who both missed the game, will continue to receive treatment and be monitored on a daily basis. The same goes for wide receiver DeSean Jackson, who has missed the past six games with a strained hamstring. \nStarting center Kory Lichtensteiger missed his second straight game with a disc-related injury in his neck. The injury has impacted Lichtensteiger’s left shoulder, diminishing his full use and strength of the limb. Gruden estimated that Lichtensteiger is probably at about 60 percent. \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:58:56.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
