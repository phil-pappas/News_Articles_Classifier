Matsatsantsa went into the break leading 1-0 following great interplay by both sides. Chances came flying for either side and in the ninth minute Clayton Daniels saw his header being punched over the posts by the Arrows shotstopper. An opening arrived in the 32nd minute when Kingston Nkhatha gave his side the lead with a superb half volley. Serame Letsoaka’s men tried all they could to level matters before the break, however some solid defensive play by the home side meant they took a 1-0 lead to the break. After the restart, Gordon Igusend’s men looked more positive and Nkhatha almost doubled his side’s lead in the 47th minute but the keeper was alert to the danger. In the 52nd minute Thuso Phala powered his way past his man but his shot went way over the bar. Igesund’s men looked more lethal heading to the latter stages of the match, however luck seemed to have eluded the capital club. The Durbanites looked like a side that could equalise in the 84th minute however the referee awarded a penalty against them. Jeremy Brockie slotted home to make it 2-0. In the 87th minute, the New Zealand striker completed his brace feasting on a defensive error and slotted home to make it 3-0. Shortly after that, Katju Ikea grabbed one back for the visiting side. Despite late pressure from both sides, Abafana Bes’thende could not replicate their league win over United and are out of the tournament. SuperSport on the other hand is on its way to the final four.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:12:26.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
