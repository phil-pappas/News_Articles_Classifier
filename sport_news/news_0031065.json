He'll require surgery on Tuesday and miss four weeks, the school announced.\nHawkins, a former Mr. Basketball from Richmond, Ky., is expected to return to practice in early November.\n\"I really feel bad to have to report this because Dom was playing well,\" coach John Calipari said in a news release. \"He was so much more confident, so much more skilled. There was no doubt he was in the rotation, and now he's just got to get back and stay in shape. We're looking forward to getting him back in November.\"\nHawkins has played in 56 career games and started nine last season. He's only scored 54 points at UK, but is known as a lockdown defender who shined during the Wildcats' 2014 Final Four run. Hawkins came off the bench to harass the best scorer for Louisville, Michigan and Wisconsin and help UK reach the NCAA title game.\nHis sophomore highlights included a six-assist game against Eastern Kentucky and six points, three assists and two steals in 20 minutes against Missouri. Hawkins said during preseason interviews that he was working on becoming a more confident scorer.\n\"I feel like my offense has improved. In pickup games, I've definitely been showing that I'm not afraid to shoot the ball anymore or drive to the rack,\" he said this summer. \"I'm not going to lie: I was afraid. I was afraid to miss it and come out of the game … (felt) like I let the team down if I don't make that shot.\"\nBut Hawkins, who has struggled to carve out a larger role on loaded UK teams the last two years, said his teammates have encouraged him to play free \"because they want me to show people that I'm a great offensive play as (I am) defensive.\" And with seven players from last season's 38-1 team leaving early for the NBA, he sensed an opportunity.\n\"Hopefully this is my moment,\" said Hawkins, a relentlessly positive person who planned to do \"whatever Coach Cal wants me to do. He's a Hall of Fame coach; he knows what he's doing. If he puts me in, I'm going to be happy about it. But if he doesn't put me in, I'm still going to be happy about it. I believe that whenever I get my chance, I'll be able to make the right moment for myself.\"\nKyle Tucker can be reached at (502) 582-4361.
