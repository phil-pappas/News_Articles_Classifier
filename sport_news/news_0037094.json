Meanwhile, almost two-thirds of home fire deaths resulted from fires in homes with no smoke alarms or no working smoke alarms.\nThis year's Fire Prevention Week campaign includes the following smoke alarm messages:\n• Install smoke alarms in every bedroom, outside each separate sleeping area and on every level of the home, including the basement.\n• Interconnect all smoke alarms throughout the home. This way, when one sounds, they all do.\n• Test alarms at least monthly by pushing the test button.\n• Replace all smoke alarms when they are 10 years old or sooner if they don't respond properly.\n• Make sure everyone in the home knows the sound of the smoke alarm and understands what to do when they hear it.\nFor years now the New Orleans Fire Department has been conducting its \"Save Lives, Install Dat\" Smoke Detector Installation Program.\nFire department officials say uniformed, on-duty NOFD personnel will visit homes, churches and non-profit organizations to assess fire safety needs and install 10-year Lithium Battery Smoke Detectors or replace 9-volt batteries in hard-wired smoke detector systems for any Orleans Parish Resident in need.\nNew Orleans Fire Department Superintendent Tim McConnell often states that during his \"entire career in the fire service, I have never experienced a fire related fatality where a working smoke detector was present.\"\nMcConnell encourages residents to learn more about the department's Community Outreach and Fire Safety Programs and activities.\nTo request a smoke detector through the \"Save Lives, Install Dat\" Smoke Detector Program, \" call 504-658-4714 or visit nola.gov/nofd\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
