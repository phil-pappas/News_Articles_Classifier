For the first time this year, we took a triple hit in Friday Pickorama.\nThe trio of East Boston, BC High and Walpole all lost by double digits, proving how badly we underestimated the winners (Madison Park, Andover and Milton, respectively).\nWith the possibility of another rough week in Pickorama, we’re heading to the excuse board. Any game lost this weekend will be attributed to Hurricane Joaquin.\nTEWKSBURY over Andover: Should be a crazy night with the portable lights in Tewksbury.\nBC HIGH over Brockton: Basing this pick on the real possibility that Kerry Raymond doesn’t play.\nFoxboro over CANTON: Feel good about the Warriors unless it goes to overtime, where the Bulldogs have been lethal.\nHolliston over WESTWOOD: Going against the advice of a certain parent — even if he is from Wolverine Country.\nMarshfield over BRIDGEWATER-RAYNHAM: Could be one of the better contests this weekend.\nMELROSE over Watertown: Red Raiders prevail in this battle of unbeatens.\nLawrence Academy over GOVERNOR’S ACADEMY: Hope this isn’t my annual get burned for picking against Governors game.\nCentral Catholic over EVERETT: The Raiders have a history of excellence at Everett Memorial, even if it’s just a one-game history.\nST. JOHN’S PREP over Malden Catholic: Eagles have too much arsenal for the upstart Lancers.\n(HOME TEAM IN CAPS)\nLast week: 7-3 (.700)\nSeason to date : 23-7 (.767)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:39:50.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
