Growing up, he spent his summers with his grandparents, Luke and Irene Wagley, on their farm. Some of his fondest childhood memories were made there, working by his Grandaddy's side. \nIn his early years, after graduating from Brownwood High School, Terry received his Peace Officer degree from Tarleton State University and went on to work as a police officer at the Brownwood Police Department. He later worked as an officer at the Early police department, then as a volunteer at the Comanche Sheriff’s Office. Ending his career, Terry retired after fourteen years and one month as the NCIC coordinator for the State of Texas. \nTerry had a passion for creating, and a fine artist he was! Among other artistry, wood crafting was one of his greatest talents; Terry built rocking chairs and toys, such as wooden trains and cars for his grandchildren. He also designed jewelry from rocks he tumbled, hand polished and carved by hand. Terry was also a great musician; he loved to play the piano and the violin, and hardly would a moment pass that he wasn’t humming a tune or singing a song. \nThe sweet spirit of Terry will never be forgotten; he had an infectious smile, and when he laughed, he did so from the depths of his soul. He loved his family and wasn’t ever afraid to show it. In lieu of flowers or donations, hug your children, grandchildren, your parents, or your friends, tell them how much you love them, and continue your lives with a smile on your face, knowing that Terry is enjoying the gift of eternal life, with a grin from ear to ear. “If there ever comes a day when we can’t be together, keep me in your heart, I’ll stay there forever.” – Winnie the Pooh \nVisitation will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015 at Heartland Funeral Home. Services will be held at 2 p.m. Friday, Oct. 2, 2015 at Austin Avenue Church of Christ, followed by burial in the Jordan Springs cemetery. \nCondolences can be offered to the family at heartlandfuneralhome.net .
