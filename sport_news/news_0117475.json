Whitman’s Cherokee Washington led all players in digs with 20, while teammate Natalia Zea was a defensive presence at the net, closing her night with four blocks. The Missionaries (4-13, 2-9 NWC) owned leads against Whitworth (15-6, 9-2) in both the second and third sets. Each time, though, the Pirates were able to rally for a win, ending the match 25-18, 25-18 and 25-20. The best chance for Whitman to steal a set came in the third, when it raced out to an early lead and parlayed that momentum into a 10-7 advantage. Whitworth steeled itself against the Missionary attack, however, and ran off seven consecutive points to take hold of the game. Whitman didn’t go quietly, rallying back from a 20-15 deficit with four straight points. A Pirates setting error handed over the third straight point and then Zea threw up a brick wall near the right antennae to record a commanding solo block that pulled the Missionaries within a point a 20-19. Five of the next six points then fell Whitworth’s way, allowing the hosts to escape with the set and match win. Abby Seethoff and Megan Henry spearheaded Whitman’s attack at the net with eight and seven kills, respectively. Washington posted a career night on the floor, and she gained help doing the dirty work down low from Codie Conching (12 digs), Anna Dawson (eight digs) and Seethoff (eight digs). That quartet helped lead Whitman to a 57-50 edge in digs during the match. Whitman heads to George Fox on Saturday.
