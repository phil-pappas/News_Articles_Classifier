The star back was injured on the first play from scrimmage in the 38-31 loss. Georgia’s director of sports medicine said in a release Sunday that Chubb damaged several ligaments and cartilage, but did not have an ACL tear. Director Ron Courson added the damage is repairable, full recovery is expected and surgery will take place within two weeks.
