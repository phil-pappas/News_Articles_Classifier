(John McCoy/Los Angeles Daily News via AP) \nNEW YORK — Chase Utley was not in the Los Angeles Dodgers' starting lineup for Game 3 of their NL Division Series against the New York Mets on Monday night. \nInstead of Utley, Los Angeles manager Don Mattingly started Howie Kendrick at second. \nUtley appealed his two-game suspension assessed by Major League Baseball on Sunday night for an illegal slide in Game 2, which broke the right leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada. The appeal meant the penalty could not start until after a hearing and a decision. \nKendrick is 1 for 6 against Mets Game 3 starter Matt Harvey, while Utley is 6 for 18. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:04:08.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
