The Mount St. Joseph University freshman died from brain cancer in April. \nXavier and Mount St. Joseph say the bobbleheads depict her scoring against Hiram College last Nov. 2. \nHill used her last months to raise money for cancer research and to remind people that life is precious. \nHiram will visit again as part of a doubleheader, with proceeds going to cancer research. Xavier's women's team plays Evansville. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:58:10.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
