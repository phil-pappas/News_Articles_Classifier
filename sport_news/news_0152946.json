Almost a month down the road, the Skyhawks (7-3, 4-1 Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference) suffered their third loss of the season, 3-0 at Colorado Mesa, snapping the winning streak at seven games. “We didn’t give our best representation of who we are (Sunday) but all the credit to Colorado Mesa, they were the better team and deserved to win,” Fort Lewis head coach Oige Kennedy said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “One thing about ending a winning streak is that you have the chance to start another.” Fort Lewis was struck by the injury bug Sunday. Malik Badawi, who scored his first goal of the year in Friday’s 3-0 win against Westminster College, was injured in warmups, and major offensive threat Tamino Kroeger was sidelined with a leg injury. The Mavericks (7-2-1, 4-1 RMAC) took the lead just before halftime on Luis Schraidt’s rebound in the 43rd minute and never gave it up. Alec Dinsmore and Blake Carlson added goals for Colorado Mesa in the second half to put the game out of reach. Fort Lewis had some chances to get back in the game but couldn’t capitalize on those chances. Yannis Becker and Raul Pescador led the team with two shots, but Fort Lewis was outshot 15-7 by Colorado Mesa for the duration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:56:50.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
