Birmingham Seaholm’s fifth-year boys soccer head coach sweated through both in Thursday’s Division 1 district semifinal game against Berkley played at Bloomfield Hills. \nIt turned into a positive experience for Whitelaw’s Maples. \nAfter going scoreless through 80 minutes of regulation time and 20 more minutes of two overtime sessions, Seaholm and Berkley were forced to decide the outcome via shootout. \nMaple goalie Joey Kopmeyer set the tone on the shootout’s first shot by stopping Berkley senior Peyton Gallagher with a diving save to his right. Seaholm senior captain Sebastian Fay followed with a goal for the 1-0 advantage. \nEach team made their remaining shots which allowed the Maples to stay alive in the state tournament with an official 1-0 victory after winning the shootout 5-4. \n“That was something else. It’s the first shootout I’ve ever had in the districts and it was pretty intense, to say the least,” said Whitelaw. “We enjoyed this one. It’s exciting, you know.” \nKopmeyer, a junior having an excellent season for the Maples, stopped all five shots he faced in regulation time and one more in the first overtime to keep Berkley off the board. In the shootout, he guessed right on the first shooter and came up with the key save which proved pivotal. \n“I saw when (the Berkley shooter) first approached the ball that his hips turned a little bit to the left,” said Kopmeyer about that initial save. “And so when I dove to my right I was lucky and fortunate enough to get a foot to it and keep my team from going one goal down. \n“It’s very intense out there, but I think it’s very important to keep your cool and not let the moment get to you,” he said. “It was a great game. Our fans came out and the team really stepped up. I’m really proud of the guys.” \nWhitelaw praised Kopmeyer’s play and indicated that first save was the key. \n“We have an outstanding goalie,” said Whitelaw. “I believe we have the best goalie in the state. I think he proved it on the first save. That was the difference between the win and loss. \n“When you save that first one with a very good goalie, it builds confidence as a shooter,” he said. “I can tell you that as an old player. It feels great when the goalie makes that first save. You have a little more zip in your step when you shoot.” \nSeaholm’s other shootout scorers after Fay were junior Alex Kerstetter, senior Devin Smock, junior Tom Booth and junior Aaron Weiss. Weiss poured in the eventual game winner as the teams were tied 4-all in shootout goals. \n“It was the best feeling in the world,” said Booth about his game winner. “My mindset was it was just like practice and don’t worry about the fans and just bury it. I was lucky it went in. I was nervous when I went up there, but I just tried to go as quick as possible and bury it.” \nIt was a well-played game full of strong midfield battles and steady defensive play by both teams. \nBerkley, an OAA Red Division member, had the better scoring chances in the first half and enjoyed three corners to Seaholm’s zero. In the second half, the Maples, representing the OAA White Division, picked up the intensity and held a 5-4 edge in shots. \nHowever, neither team was able to score. \nFay and Booth both had strong attacks in overtime, with Booth pounding the ball off the far left crossbar midway through the second OT session. Berkley senior Zachary Combs slammed a shot just wide of the goal in the second OT. \n“We had a couple guys go down late so we finished the game with a different lineup than we were anticipating,” said Whitelaw. “They were giving it all they had. They were two good teams and it was an evenly matched game, I thought. \n“They had their chances, we had a few,” he said. “For a 0-0 game, it was actually pretty entertaining, I thought. It was a great win for us. You have to give it up to Berkley, they are a heck of a team.” \nSeaholm (11-4-5), which opened the district with an emotional 2-1 triumph over Brother Rice on Tuesday, will play for the district championship 5 p.m. Saturday afternoon against Bloomfield Hills. The Black Hawks advanced with a 6-0 victory over Royal Oak. 4 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.hometownlife.com/story/sports/high-school/birmingham/2015/10/22/seaholm-survives-shootout-advances-district-final/74434946/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:12:50.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
