By Rod Zundel | Posted Oct 7th, 2015 @ 10:00pm 0  \nSALT LAKE CITY — Larry Krystkowiak and the No. 15-ranked Utes' men's basketball team have gone through practices in the opening week of preseason, and they're still looking to fill the role left by Delon Wright, who is now with the Toronto Raptors. \nWright, who averaged 14.5 points, five rebounds, five assists and two steals per game a year ago while leading the Runnin' Utes to the Sweet 16, will be missed not just for his all-around game but for his leadership presence. \nKrystkowiak didn't put any pressure on finding \"the next Delon Wright,\" though. \n\"There's not going to be a guy who does what Delon did,\" the sixth-year head coach said. \"Each season, there's a different cast of characters, and we're going to have a different identity.\" \nBrandon Taylor could be one guy tasked with picking up the load. The senior point guard averaged 10.6 points and 3.3 assists per game last year, when he was named to the all-Pac-12 second team. \nBut he's not the only one who will be asked to do more. \n\"I think we're a lot deeper than last year, and I think ironically we are more talented than we were last year,\" Taylor said. \"Us being deeper players is in our favor in so many ways. I think that's the biggest difference from last year.\" \nReplacing Wright's production, then, will likely come by committee. \n\"Collectively, you hope that everybody is ready to pitch in a few more percents, assists, steals, or whatever is coming up,\" Krystkowiak said. \"There's no heat on anybody to try to fill that void. We had two great years with (Wright), and he's off to greener pastures. Now it's time for these guys to step up.\" Rod Zundel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:28:44.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
