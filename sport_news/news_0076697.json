(Photo: Palladium-Item Joshua Smith) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMatt Fisher sees this as a golden opportunity for the Red Devils. \nHis Richmond volleyball team drew not only a perennial sectional contender in New Castle but also the host of Class 4A Sectional 9. \n\"We're excited about the challenge,\" Fisher said. \nAnd about the chance at some redemption. \nNew Castle knocked off Richmond 2-0 in pool play Sept. 12 during the New Castle Invitational. \nFisher does not believe his team was at its best that day. \n\"That was probably our worst game of the year,\" he said. \"We were able to review that match and we have a game plan going in.\" \nRichmond and New Castle face off at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in the second match of the sectional's opening round. Greenfield-Central will play Pendleton Heights at 6 p.m. \nMount Vernon and Connersville both received byes to Saturday's semifinal round. Semifinal matches are at 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., with the final scheduled for 7 p.m. that night. \n\"Our sectional is still extremely competitive,\" Fisher said. \"It will certainly be interesting this year to see who comes out on top.\" \nRichmond finished its regular season 22-11 and placed third in the North Central Conference Tournament. \nWhile Fisher wanted to see the Red Devils play for a title that day, he was happy with their response to a semifinal loss as they rebounded to defeat Harrison in the third-place match. \nIt's a similar reaction he wants to see Thursday. \n\"It was probably the one we wanted the most, to be able to prove to ourselves we can play much better than we played the first time,\" Fisher said of drawing the Trojans. \"Our girls know the first time around we did not give it our best effort and play to our ability. We are extremely determined. \n\"They (the Trojans) have a really good middle who has led their offense this year we have to look out for. They've played some good teams throughout the state and play a good schedule. ... As a coach, you like to see how much your team has gained over the year, and certainly New Castle will be a good measuring stick for that.\" \nJosh Chapin: (765) 973-4463 jchapin@pal-item.com or twitter.com/JoshChapinPI \nClass 4A Sectional 9 \nMatch 1: Greenfield-Central vs. Pendleton Heights, 6 p.m. Thursday \nMatch 2: Richmond vs. New Castle, 7:30 p.m. Thursday \nMatch 3: Match 1 winner vs. Match 2 winner, 11 a.m. Saturday \nMatch 4: Mt.
