It was the third time this year the Vols lost a game in which they led by 10 or more points. \nBoth coaches know how the fans feel. \n“I’m disappointed for us a team, players and coaches, but I know our fans are sick about it and I don’t blame them,” coach Mark Richt said after the loss to Alabama. “We got whipped. We all know it and we’ve got to do something about it. We’ll watch the film and face the truth and look at ways we can improve. We as coaches have to make decisions to do that.” \nOffensive tackle John Theus said Georgia (4-1) will bounce back. \n“In this league you can’t focus on one game for too long, so we will watch film, learn from it and move on,” the former Bolles standout said. \nTennessee’s problems also include close losses to Oklahoma and Florida. \n“I feel the pain of everyone involved,” head coach Butch Jones said. “I am responsible. I get that. I hurt with them, but I also see the progress, and I think that is evident by the number of people that have reached out to us from all levels, saying ‘Stay the course. You’re getting close.’ ” \nMississippi State still a work in progress \nThe schedule-makers clearly didn’t do the Bulldogs (3-2) any favors with three Top 25 opponents — two of them on the road — in the first five games. But that’s still not an excuse for their 1-2 start in the SEC West, head coach Dan Mullen said. \n“We have guys that will fight and play hard,” he said after a 30-17 loss last Saturday at Texas A&M. “The one thing we have to learn how to do is to go expect to make plays. We have guys expecting to make plays, but we have a lot of guys who are looking around at somebody else to go make plays. \n“As we go forward, they will get a lot less worried about ‘Am I doing the right thing?’ and just letting it go and playing at 100 miles an hour. If we get 50 guys playing that way, we’ll be a really good team.” \nThe Bulldogs finally get a break with three consecutive home games — Troy, Louisiana Tech and Kentucky — when they should be listed as favorites. \nLSU wants S. Carolina \nto feel ‘at home’ \nWhile South Carolina was forced to move Saturday’s home game to LSU following massive flooding around Columbia, S.C., the Tigers said they will do everything possible to make the Gamecocks feel at home. \nThe game will be played at Tigers Stadium at 3:30 p.m. South Carolina will wear white jerseys, while LSU will wear its visiting purple jerseys. \nIt’s the first time an SEC team played a “home” game on the road since LSU switched to Arizona State in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina. \nClasses were canceled for the entire week at South Carolina. \nLSU season ticket holders had until 6 p.m. Thursday to buy seats for the game. After that, the rest went on sale to the general public. The Tigers don’t expect to open its upper decks. LSU will give ticket and some concessions revenue to the Gamecocks after they recoup the expenses — about $500,000 — of hosting the game. \n“We’ve been through this in Louisiana,” LSU athletics director Joe Alleva said. “We want to help any way we can.” \nEtc. \nOne streak continued and another one ended with Alabama’s 38-10 win at Georgia. RB Nick Chubb ran 83 yards for a TD with five seconds remaining to finish with 146 yards to tie Hershel Walker ’s Bulldogs record of 13 consecutive games with at least 100 yards in rushing. At the same time, Alabama’s string of being the favored team ended at 72 games. Georgia was installed as a one-point favorite by Las Vegas bookmakers. … The SEC Nation pregame show featuring Tim Tebow, Greg McElroy and Marcus Spears will make a detour to Knoxville, Tenn., for Saturday’s game between Tennessee and Georgia. The network was supposed to go to South Carolina for its matchup against LSU, but that game was moved to because of heavy flooding in Columbia, S.C.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:44:19.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
