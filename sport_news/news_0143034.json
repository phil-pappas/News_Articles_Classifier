After picking up two on penalty kicks, the 23-year-old Brazilian racked up two more, firstly, by cashing in on a deflection and then off an assist by his buddy Luis Suarez. That buddy, meanwhile, tapped in the fifth and final goal in Barca’s 5-2 victory off an assist from Ney. \nAnd while Barca fans were happy to see the team dominate even without leader Lionel Messi, who’s currently recovering from a knee injury, they might’ve been more happy about what Neymar told broadcaster beIN Sports after the game. He reassured fans that he’s going to be with Barcelona for the long haul and that he’s not thinking about transferring to Manchester United or anywhere else. \n[ Neymar’s dad says Manchester United made a bid for his son this summer ] \n“The [contract] renewal is under way. … I’m going to sign. The fans can relax,” Neymar said (via ESPN FC ). \nThe player, who now leads La Liga with eight goals this season (rival Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid is in second with six goals total), also expressed his joy over his performance. This was the first time the player scored four goals in a single Barcelona game. \n“[It] was an historic night which I am going to savor for all my life,” he said. “I want to congratulate the team for producing a great performance.” Marissa Payne writes for The Early Lead, a fast-breaking sports blog, where she focuses on what she calls the “cultural anthropological” side of sports, aka “mostly the fun stuff.” She is also an avid WWE fan. sports Success!
