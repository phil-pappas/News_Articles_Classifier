Doesn't this sound like just what the Dolphins need? He demands these players become, \"primates again,\" as they were in his first game as head coach. Just like he can be right down to his musical tastes. (He also likes country music and classic rock.) \nCampbell once stood in line all night to land tickets to see Metallica, knowing they'd sell out when the box office opened at 8 a.m. He got there plenty early, too. Have Dolphins transformed from finesse to physical team? \nX's and Omar: Sun-Sentinel's Omar Kelly and CBS 12's Matt Lincoln discuss the Dolphins situation as they prepare for the Texans. \nX's and Omar: Sun-Sentinel's Omar Kelly and CBS 12's Matt Lincoln discuss the Dolphins situation as they prepare for the Texans. See more videos \n\"I was like fourth in line,\" he said. \"It worked out.\" \nThis was in college at Texas A&M, and Campbell bought tickets for his roommates, one of whom was Shane Lechler, the Houston Texans punter who faces the Dolphins at Sun Life Stadium this Sunday. \nLechler texted Campbell on Wednesday that he \"dropped a bomb\" to the Houston media about their college days. Campbell soon heard. It was how his roommates called him, Dan-tallica,\" because of his Metallica love. \nAsked his favorite Metallica songs, Campbell said, \"'Ride the Lightning' was a good one, 'Master of Puppets.' 'One.' 'Unforgiven.' 'Nothing Else Matters' …\" \nHe chuckled. \"I could go on.\" \nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra occasionally threatens players that he might play music from his generation — U2 and 2Pac — if practices don't go as planned, rather than what players prefer. \nThere has been no Metallica takeover at Dolphins practices just yet. \nLong snapper John Denney is a heavy-metal fan. He attended a Metallica concert last year with former Dolphins punter Brandon Fields at the BB&T Center with tickets courtesy of former special teams coach John Bonamego. \nCameron Wake, who listens to, \"anything but country,\" has Metallica songs on various playlists he's made, which also include the likes of Rick Ross and The Black Eyed Peas. Like Denney, he hasn't noticed any Metallica at practice. \n\"I may slip one in at some point, but half those guys I don't even know if they are going to know who [Metallica is],\" Campbell said. \"It would probably do the opposite effect for them. It might drag them down.\" \nMetallica sports fame derives from longtime New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera always coming into games to the song \"Enter Sandman.\" That led to an ESPN SportsCenter commercial last year that joked about Metallica having plenty of free time now that Rivera is retired. \nCampbell hasn't met any Metallica band members. But this could be leading to an AFC East version of Battle of the Bands. New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, after all, is known for his friendship with Jon Bon Jovi. \n\"Look, I like his music, he likes football, so that's a good thing,\" Belichick once said. \nThe Patriots have owned the Dolphins for years. But if we're going by the coach's personal band, do you want a haired-up Bon Jovi singing, \"It's my life, it's now or never …?\" \nOr do you want a coach who enjoys guitars thrashing in Metallica's \"The Unforgiven II\" to the lyrics, \"Speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run …?\" \nThe big transition here is for Anne Rodriguez, who remains the assistant to Dolphins coaches. From the Carpenters to Metallica? She again must brace for changed music from the new guy.
