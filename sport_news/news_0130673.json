It was awesome.” \nPlayers who are injured or not on the active roster often talk about how they no longer feel part of the team, that they’re basically ghosts to the guys in the clubhouse and nobody really wants to have much to do with them. \nBut Kawasaki is clearly a different story in these American League playoffs. Time and again, Blue Jays players have mentioned — unsolicited — how great it is having the Japanese infielder around, even though he isn’t playing. Knuckleballer R.A. Dickey mentioned a time during the ALDS against the Rangers when Kawasaki had the team in stitches when he launched into a impromptu jig. And now that the Jays find themselves down 0-2 in the ALCS to the Kansas City Royals, Kawasaki’s presence is more welcome than ever to the Jays, many of them who call him their best teammate ever. Veteran lefty Mark Buehrle has certainly said that many times. \n“He always says, ‘Never bad day. Never bad day.’ And he’s not lying,” said Colabello, who is hitting a cool .375 in the post-season. “He’s everything you look for in a teammate because he’s the epitome of positivity.” \nPlayers who aren’t in the active lineup will sometimes become hostile when approached by the media. The last thing they want to do is bring attention to themselves given that they aren’t contributing anything on the field. But, again, Kawasaki is a different story. Colabello and right-handed starter Marco Estrada were asked on Sunday if Kawasaki’s act ever gets old, especially if the club finds itself in a tough spot and nobody’s in a great mood. Both insisted that’s never the case with the outgoing infielder and they’re thrilled that he’s still here. \n“That’s why he’s here. He’s a huge part of this team, on the field and off the field,” said Estrada. “He’s just a great guy to be around and we all enjoy him so much that I think that’s why they kept him here, just to keep the morale up, keep everybody nice and loose and makes us laugh a little bit. \n“I mean, you’ve seen him on TV, the way he is. And he’s basically the same guy here. I’m not really sure how he does it, he just does it,” Estrada added. “He’s one of my favourite teammates, he’s awesome to have around. He’s just a good guy.” \nJapanese players have long had a reputation as being stoic and reluctant to speak to the North American media. But Kawasaki loves to talk and has no filter, for instance joyfully informing millions of Canadians on TV following the Jays’ clinching the AL East title that he was drunk. He certainly was a happy drunk. On Sunday, Kawasaki launched into an upbeat speech when asked what his message has been to his teammates during the ups and downs of the MLB playoffs. \n“Very important they smile. Smile,” he said. “Lose? Lose no good. But smile. Yeah. Very important. Just smile.” \nAs for his address to the team following the loss in Game 2 of the ALDS, Kawasaki said: “I say, ‘Let’s go.’ F... yeah. F..king go. Let’s get up. My teammates? The best. You are the best. I said, ‘You are Ironman, Spiderman uh, Spiderman, Ironman...’” \nUnable to come up with any more superheroes, Kawasaki repeated “Ironman” once more. \n“The Hulk?” he was offered. \n“Hulk! You are very good,” Kawasaki replied. “Okay, good thinking. Just play, just have fun and enjoy the game. I love my teammates. I love Toronto. My respect my teammates. Wow. \n“We still have very important game to come,” he continued. “We want to stay focussed. Everybody plays the best they can. Play the best because everybody good player, great player. Kansas City, good player too. Good game. Great game. And fun. We’ll just have fun and enjoy the game.” \nIt’s tough to argue with that.
