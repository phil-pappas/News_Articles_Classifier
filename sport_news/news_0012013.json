Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 10:27 pm | Updated: 10:36 pm, Thu Oct 15, 2015. With three teams jockeying for the second seed in Class 5A, Region 3, Sylacauga’s high school football team hopes to pull ahead of the pack in a matchup against Central Clay County in Lineville on Friday night at 7. The Aggies (5-2, 3-1) lost to the Volunteers 24-17 in 2014 at Legion Stadium. Sylacauga coach Matt Griffith said after his team’s 49-48 win over Shelby County last week that he wanted to get his players more work tackling, but it wasn’t outside the norm to focus on tackling fundamentals during practice. “We always emphasize it … it’s the biggest thing,” he said. “After going back and watching film, our kids are in position to make plays, and they’re not making plays. You’ve got to be able to make a tackle when you’re unblocked. That comes down to a kid making that (play). “We just stressed that (as much) as we stress it every single day. Our defensive staff does a great job of coaching our kids, and it just comes down to kids making plays when they’re supposed to.” He added the Volunteers (4-3, 3-1) have played a stout schedule that has them prepared for the matchup against the Aggies. “Their three losses are to three excellent football teams,” Griffith said. “They’ve lost to Leeds, (which has a team that) is outstanding. They’ve lost to Benjamin Russell, and they’ve lost to Beauregard, who’s probably going to win the region. “The biggest concerns we have are they’re very well-coached defensively. Defense is their strong point. Offensively, (Damion Ford) and (Davyn Flenord) are very dangerous at receiver, and that takes the pressure off their run game. You’re so worried about those two big receivers that it opens up gaps for the running backs.” Griffith said the team will rely on the play-making abilities of quarterback Jackson Walker and his one-two punch at running back: Alex Thomason and Ke’Vion Ross. “The biggest thing is we’ve got to have a big offensive night,” Griffith said. “We’ve got to be able to move the football and we’ve got to be able to knock out first downs … If you knock out first downs consistently, then the home runs come. “We’ve got to be very consistent on offense, move the football and do what we do well. We feel the home runs will come if we do that.” He provided an injury update on a pair of players who won’t play Friday – defensive back Keaton Wilson and wide receiver Bailey Ward. “(Wilson) had a shoulder pop out of place and pop right back in,” Griffith said. “He’s in therapy right now. We really feel that he’ll be back next week, but we are going to hold him out this week. “Ward, our X receiver, we really got good news on him. We really thought it was a torn ACL. It’s a strained MC. “We’ll be holding him out. Hopefully, we’ll get him back next week or the next. We’re a little banged up but not as much as we were last year going into the same ball game.” Griffith said his players and coaches know just how tough an opponent they’ll be facing Friday. “We’ve got our hands full,” he said. “We feel, as a coaching staff, that it’s a very evenly-matched football game. It’s two very good football teams with very good traditions. Both teams, we feel, are very well-coached, and it’s going to come down to team that makes the least mistakes.” Contact Shane Dunaway via email at sdunaway@dailyhome.com or on Twitter @DailyHome_Shane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:23:22.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
