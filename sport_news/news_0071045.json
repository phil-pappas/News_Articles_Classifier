One goal was going to win tonight.”\nBoth power plays went 0-for-3, as the Penguins had a great opportunity to change that in the third. Mark Borowiecki was called for a delay of game penalty early in the period when he backhanded the puck over the boards — despite the vehement protests of coach Dave Cameron, who pointed out his defenceman was in the neutral zone when he shot.\nThe Senators couldn’t reverse the call, but did kill off the 1:21 of 5-on-3 they were left playing as Erik Karlsson was already in the box.\nAfter a scoreless second period which saw the Senators outshot 16-6, the Penguins struck quickly in the second.\nMalkin scored his 19th goal in 30 regular season meeting with Ottawa at the 23 second mark of the period took a puck shoved up the right wing boards by Patric Hornqvist and, with Erik Karlsson as the lone man back, fired a shot from the offensive zone circle between Anderson’s right arm and his body.\n“It went through my six-hole there,” said Anderson. “It’s just one of those things ... he’s one of the best in the world, and when good players have a knack for scoring, they score. Make that save, different game? I don’t know.”\nMethot was caught up ice on and couldn’t get back time to disrupt Malkin.\n“We pinched and we still have guys back, it’s a routine play,” he said. “I think he got a little lucky on that shot too. At the end of the day, those are the breakdowns that kill you, and we’ve got to clean it up.”\nJust 2:02 later, former Senator Matt Cullen set up rookie Sprong up in the slot for a shot that found the back of the net up high as Anderson tried to stack the pads. It was Sprong’s first NHL goal.\nShortly after that, Crosby was set up on a 2-on-1 but uncharacteristically missed the open side.\nThe Senators failed to take advantage of two power play chances in the middle period, the second of which began with 1:17 to go before the intermission. Before the horn sounded, Bobby Ryan, Karlsson and Turris all missed the net with point blank chances.\n“One good thing is we’re beating the goalie,” said Anderson. “We just weren’t able to put it on net.\n“We’re going to get our chances, we got our chances. It was one of those nights where our sights just weren’t on.”\nThe Senators were outplayed early in the first period, although while holding the territorial advantage the Penguins only had five shots on goal through nine minutes. Ryan had the Senators best when he was set up alone in front by Mike Hoffman, but Fleury made a nice shoulder stop.\nAnderson came up big by making a save off a Kris Letang wraparound and then, after Ryan gave the puck to the Penguins on a 3-on-2 rush, when Pittsburgh charged back into the zone for more chances.\nTurris had a close in chance with one minute, but Fleury made a good stop on him too.\n“We just couldn’t capitalize off the rush,” said Turris. “It definitely would have made it a different game.”\nMeanwhile, one Ottawa streak was continued, albeit a short one. For the second game in a row, Borowiecki laid a pounding on an opponent, this time thumping Bobby Farnham in the third period.\nThe Senators returned home after the game to prepare for Saturday’s visit by the Nashville Predators.\nTwitter: @sundonib\nSenators stop Sid, but not Penguins\nBy Don Brennan , Ottawa Sun First posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 09:57 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 15, 2015 10:51 PM EDT\nThe Senators were able to extend the scoreless streak of Sidney Crosby to four games, but they could not push the Penguins to a similar drought.\nIn their second of back-to-back games against a winless team, the Senators had little success, falling 2-0 to the Penguins Thursday at Consol Energy Center.\nIt was the Ottawa's first regulation time road loss since Feb. 3, a string that was snapped at 14-0-3, and left the Senators with a 3-2-0 record coming out of the gate to greet the 2015-16 campaign.\nThe Penguins are now 1-3-0.\nMeanwhile, Crosby has still yet to register a goal or an assist this season, equalling the second longest pointless stretch of his illustrious career counting playoffs.\nOnly once has he gone five games without a point, and that was back in November, 2009.\nEvgeni Malkin and Daniel Sprong had the Pittsburgh goals, while Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 21 shots for the shutout.\nAlso in this article Sens vs. Pens, Oct. 16, 2015 About the author Don Brennan Don Brennan's Blog Follow Don Brennan on Twitter Other Stories Ottawa Senators explode for 7 against Jackets\nFor the first part of Wednesday's game at Nationwide Arena, the Senators looked like they were distracted.
