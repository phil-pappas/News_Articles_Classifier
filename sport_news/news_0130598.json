On the one hand, the Palestinian president was calling on the nations of the world to take punitive actions against Israel as a country that is supposedly illegally occupying another nation.\nBut, in what can be seen as a positive non-declaration, Abbas stopped short of calling for an end to security and economic cooperation between the PA and Israel. That’s because he understands that an end to such cooperation would lead to the collapse of the PA. And this would be a disaster for the Palestinians, as well as for Israel.\nTens of thousands of PA employees would stop getting paid. Everything from garbage collection to law enforcement would cease to function properly and Hamas and Islamic Jihad would take advantage of the situation.\nTherefore, Abbas would like to keep in place the mechanisms that enable him and his Fatah party to remain in power, while at the same time keep the pressure on Israel to meet Palestinian demands.\nAbbas is likely to succeed in convincing the international community to up that pressure, but the leaders of the nations of the world should ask themselves whether Israel is the only obstacle to the creation of a democratic and free Palestinian state, as Abbas would have them believe.\nGranted, Israel has not kept to the letter of the Oslo Accords in issues ranging from water rights, tax collections and transfer of monies, to settlement building and house demolitions, but it is certainly not a one-way street. And most of the Israeli “infractions” have been a direct result of violations by the Palestinians.\nIsrael could decide that, like the PA, it is no longer bound by the Oslo agreements as a viable framework, and either take unilateral steps or propose a new tack to move forward.\nBut at the same time, the Palestinians should ask themselves whether it is Israeli “occupation” that is the source of all of their troubles or whether they play a role as well.\nPalestinians living in the Gaza Strip undoubtedly face harsh economic conditions, a lack of political and religious freedom, and brutal repression. But it is not because of Israel’s blockade of Gaza. It is because Hamas, a terrorist organization governed by a distorted and violent interpretation of Islam, imposes its brutal rule.\nBut apparently, like Hamas, Abbas wants the world to continue to believe that Israeli “restrictions” are to blame for the delays in rebuilding Gaza.\nSimilarly, Abbas was quiet about how Hamas regularly uses force to disperse Palestinians protesting against power shortages in the southern Gaza Strip. The lack of electricity has triggered widespread protests and many Palestinians hold Hamas directly responsible for the problem.\nEyewitnesses said Hamas police used live ammunition and clubs to disperse protesters.\nAnd Hamas has embarked on a crackdown against Fatah activists in Gaza as Fatah attempt to hold internal elections.\nThe situation under the PA in the West Bank with regard to human rights is not much better. PA security forces arrest Palestinians almost daily and hold them without trial. The PA arrests Palestinians who criticize the Palestinian leadership on social media.\nBut Abbas knows that the hypocritical “international community” does not really care when Palestinians repress other Palestinians or when Arabs repress other Arabs. This is part of the reason that only now, after the massacres in Syria have begun to affect Europeans, the “international community” is demanding that something be done to stop the bloodshed.\nAbbas is grandstanding in an effort to put the Palestinian issue back in the spotlight, but amid the glare, the facts are a little hard to see. The world should look closely before jumping on the Palestinian bandwagon.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:34:34.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
