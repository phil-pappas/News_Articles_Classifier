Unfortunately, once the sun goes down, we can't continue our daytime activities,\" said an inventor from Hicksville, N.Y. \"I wanted to be able to continue our hobby into the night, which inspired me to invent this recreational electronic flying device.\"\nHe developed THE NIGHT KITE, an electronic flying device designed to be flown both night and day. It is easily visible at night or in low-lighting conditions. The toy promotes family fun and togetherness, and offers hours of entertainment for any age. Additionally, it is easy to control and features an eye-catching design.\nThe original design was submitted to the Long Island office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
