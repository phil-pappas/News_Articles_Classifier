Through the opening five innings they held a 2-0 lead but had already hit into three double plays. \nIn the sixth the Jays had the bags loaded once again but Chris Colabello ground into a 3-2-3 double play and it look like another chance to blow the game open would be squandered. \nIt was then that Tulowitzki, who was 0-for-11 in the series, leaned into a 3-2 pitch that carried into the seats in left for his three run bomb and a 5-0 lead that would prove to be more than enough. \nSalvation and another game set to go Monday afternoon. \nLike a wise man once said: ‘It ain’t over ‘til it’s over.’ \nTHE WHEELS ARE TURNING \nIn Game 2, Rangers manager Jeff Banister walked Edwin Encarnacion intentionally in the eighth with first base open and Texas went on to retire the next batter to get out of the inning. On Sunday night, with one out in the fourth and Josh Donaldson at third, Bannister made the unusual call of intentionally walking Encarnacion again with Colabello coming to bat. I believe he overthought that one. The strategy backfired as Colabello walked on four pitches to load the bases for Tulowitzki. No matter, Martin Perez walked him on four pitches to bring in a run. \nNow it was Dioner Navarro at the plate, the count went to 3-2 and the next pitch Navarro tagged but pulled foul by third base. Perez collected himself and then induced Navarro to ground into a routine 4-6-3 double play to end the inning and put the brakes on what was shaping up to be a big Jays inning. \nThe Rangers caught a big break there. \nTAKE THE LEAD \nThe Jays took their second lead of the series when they went in front 1-0 in the third inning. The inning looked like it might add up to something significant when Navarro opened with a double over centre fielder Delino DeShields head and Kevin Pillar followed with an infield single putting runners on the corners with nobody out. The big inning never happened as Ryan Goins ground into a double play, Navarro scoring on the play. \nThe lone other time the Jays held a lead in the series was in the fifth inning of Game 2 when they went up 4-3. That lead lasted until the eighth. \nTHE ODOR OF DEFEAT \nPost-season play is often the platform where an unheralded player rises to the top. \nIt’s happening this series for the Texas Rangers. \nAlthough the Rangers lineup boasts big-time names such as Shin-Soo Choo, Prince Fielder and Josh Hamilton, it is second baseman Rougned Odor that has made the most noise. \nSimply put, Odor has been a complete pain in the ass for the Jays. \nOverall, he’s scored five of the Rangers 11 runs in the first two games chiefly on his speed and base-running smarts. \n“We’ve got enough respect for Odor to know that he can burn you,” manager John Gibbons said of the pop in Odor’s bat. “We saw what he did to Price the other night with the homer. He’s hit, what, 17 or 18 this year (16). \nKeeping him off the bases is a priority given the damage he’s done. \n“We’re trying not to hit him I know that,” Gibbons said which drew a laugh. “Try not to walk him. Going into the series we’ve seen him on the highlights, he’s got a lot of sock in his bat. But he’s dangerous down there (in the lineup). I don’t know what we’re going to do any differently but we’ve got to get him out.” \nThis night Odor made a nifty play in the field to start a double play in the fifth while at the plate drove in the Rangers first run on a RBI grounder to short. \nStill a pain. \nNEW MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB \nIt wasn’t Mount Kilimanjaro but it was an uphill route for the Jays entering the game. R.A. Dickey, the starter for Game 4, was asked for comparisons. \n“Well, I don’t feel as nauseous as I did when I was halfway up the mountain, that’s for sure,” Dickey said before the game. “You know, like I said before, this is not an insurmountable peak. It is one that we can get to and we have gotten to it, and at times during the season when we’ve needed to win games or we’ve needed to make a move, to put ourself in position for post-season games. Like we’ve played pretty much the whole month and a half under the yoke of having to win and here we are again having to win. \n“So personally, I think that we’re feeling good in there, everybody’s loose, you don’t see any differences in behavior, people aren’t meditating in the corners or doing what you might think that they would be doing when the game is on the line. Guys are having fun and we’re enjoying being around each other. I think (Munenori) Kawasaki might help with that a little bit, but it’s a neat experience but there is a finality to it and we’re all aware of that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:05:00.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
