(AP) - A former Mississippi parole officer is pleading guilty to a federal charge that he took bribes from a parolee he was supervising.\nAndra (AHN'-dray) Smith entered the plea Friday before a federal judge, admitting he took $2,400 from a man he was supervising to allow the parolee to leave Mississippi for work.\nSmith faces up to 10 years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines. Federal prosecutors say they also want him to repay the bribe money.\nProsecutors say there are audio and video recordings of Smith taking the bribe from the parolee, and that he was bribed with money from the FBI, indicating authorities were already suspicious.\nU.S. District Judge Tom Lee scheduled Smith's sentencing for Jan. 7. He remains free on $10,000 unsecured bail.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
