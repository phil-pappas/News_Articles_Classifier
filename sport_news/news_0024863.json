A raucous announced crowd of 20,548 appeared ready to anoint Golovkin as boxing’s next big star, chanting his name at regular intervals, and then exploding after the referee Steve Willis stopped the contest at 1 minute 32 seconds of the eighth. Golovkin knocked Lemieux down with a left hook to the ribs in the closing seconds of the fifth round. Lemieux, 26, bounced back in the sixth, but over all, he could not sustain the offensive momentum necessary to keep up with Golovkin. Before Saturday night’s bout, Golovkin had last fought at the Garden on July 26, 2014, when he posted a third-round knockout victory against Daniel Geale of Australia. In an interview with HBO’s Max Kellerman after the fight, which was broadcast over the Garden’s public address system, Golovkin memorably invoked a phrase that has defined his climb up the boxing ranks.

Thanks to the excitement generated by the Geale fight and three subsequent knockout wins, the big drama show is now taking place before a wider audience. Compared with a crowd of 8,572 at the Geale fight, Golovkin’s bout against Lemieux was announced as a sellout. Golovkin (34-0, 31 knockouts) has now knocked out 21 consecutive opponents, 12 of them within three rounds. In the process, he has captured the World Boxing Association and International Boxing Organization championships, and now he has won the International Boxing Federation championship, which Lemieux held. Until Saturday, Golovkin had been unable to get a highly respected opponent to challenge him. But Lemieux (34-3, 31 knockouts) was widely thought to be a significant upgrade. Ranked the No. 4 middleweight contender by Ring magazine, Lemieux captured the I.B.F. title in June when he defeated Hassan N’Dam of Cameroon. “This is the biggest test for me,” Golovkin said before the fight. “He’s the I.B.F. champ. It’s a big situation, unification.” Golovkin’s trainer, Abel Sanchez, disagreed with his fighter, citing Curtis Stevens — whom Golovkin defeated by an eighth-round technical knockout in November 2013 — as a more difficult foe. But then, Sanchez does not believe that anyone in Golovkin’s weight class can put a stop to his fighter’s consecutive knockout streak. “I don’t think anybody at 160 pounds stays with Gennady for 12 rounds,” Sanchez said. Entering the contest, Lemieux was not intimated by Golovkin’s punching power, or the knockout streak. “I am aware of his record,” Lemieux said. “But I am also aware of who I am and what I can bring to the table.” Saturday’s card was seen by many in and around boxing as an opportunity for the sport to move beyond the Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao era. The May 2 showdown between those superstar welterweights was a hit at the box office, but the bout’s relative lack of action left many viewers disappointed. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:06:02.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
