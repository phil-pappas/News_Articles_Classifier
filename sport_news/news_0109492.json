The program said there will be no further comment regarding this matter until the proceeding is concluded.\nLatham was also suspended for the team’s season opener against Southern Illinois on Sept. 5, but a specific reason was never provided.\nOut of high school, Latham was rated a 4-star prospect by most recruiting services. He was part of the 2013 recruiting class that brought in three 4-star prospects, according to 247sports. The other two, Antonio Allen and David Kenney, are no longer with the program.\nIn three active games this season, Latham has compiled 10 tackles and five tackles for a loss, including two sacks. IU Coach Kevin Wilson said he had made a lot of progress this offseason.\nWilson and defensive line coach Larry McDaniel have both recently said Latham is a talented player who needs to work on following his assignment instead of trying to be a playmaker.\nIU will face No. 1 Ohio State on Saturday at Memorial Stadium.\nBrody Miller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:37:51.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
