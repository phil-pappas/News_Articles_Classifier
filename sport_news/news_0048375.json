The next largest buyer purchased only 325.\nTom Davis is a bidder of horses at the facility in Canon City. ( Dave Phillips ) When investigators from the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Inspector General confronted Davis about the purchases and asked him how many of those horses had been re-sold for slaughter, he told them, \"Probably close to all of them.\"\nAccording to the report, Davis sold many of the horses to buyers near the Mexican border. Investigators found records indicating those same buyers transported large numbers of horses across the border to slaughterhouses in Mexico â€” though, because local inspectors who certified the transports often didn't actually inspect the horses, the inspector general investigation could not verify that they were the same horses.\nAdvertisement Davis told investigators that he assumed the wild horses would be slaughtered, saying there was only \"one place to go ... to the kill plant.\"\n\"I'd rather see me send them down there than I would see the Government send them down there,\" Davis told investigators, according to the report.\nInvestigators first began looking into Davis's dealings after news reports, including some published in The Denver Post , raised questions about where he sent the horses he bought.\nSince 1978, when the BLM first implemented a sales program as a way to control herd sizes, it has been against federal law and policy to send wild horses sold through the program to slaughter.\nIn purchasing the horses, Davis had to tell federal officials that he would not re-sell them for slaughter. According to the report, Davis told BLM marketing specialists that he was selling the horses to good homes, either to people wanting \"pasture pets\" or people hoping to graze the animals on their lands for tax breaks. He repeatedly refused to name his buyers, and BLM officials apparently did little to follow up on where the horses went.\nAccording to the inspector general report, BLM marketing specialists' performance evaluations were based partly on how many horses they adopted out or sold.\n\"Although we found various discussions concerning allegations that Davis was sending BLM horses to slaughter, none of these discussions yielded evidence that BLM employees sold horses to Davis knowing that he was doing so,\" investigators wrote in the report.\nDavis typically bought horses by the truckload from the BLM, paying $350 for a 35-horse haul, according to the report. Most, if not all, of the horses were older and had been unsuccessfully put up for adoption before. Davis told investigators he would re-sell the truckload of horses for $3,500 to $4,000.\nBetween 2008 and 2012, Davis spent $17,940 on horses from the BLM. Because it was the BLM's policy until 2012 to transport large sales of horses to the buyer, the BLM spent more than $140,000 delivering the horses to Davis, according to the report.\nIn a written response provided along with the report, Steven Ellis, the BLM's deputy director of operations, said the BLM has procedures in place to make sure wild horses go to good homes and lamented \"Mr. Davis's deceitful actions.\"\n\"The BLM has taken additional steps to strengthen our ability to prevent this type of situation from happening,\" Ellis wrote.\nFederal and state authorities in Colorado declined to prosecute Davis for his actions, according to the inspector general report. In addition to the prohibitions on slaughter, a previous report published in the Colorado Springs Gazette suggested that Davis may have skirted Colorado brand-inspection laws.\nJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or @johningold", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1023/20151023__tom-davis~p1_200.jpg", "https://www.doioig.gov/sites/doioig.gov/files/WildHorseBuyer_Public.pdf", "http://gazette.com/article/153122"], "published": "2015-10-23T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:04:32.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
