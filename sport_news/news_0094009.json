There were times during the preseason when he looked like the elite Carmelo Anthony, the top-10 player who can score when he wants, who jab steps and buries the jumper as if the two points were choreographed. Then there were other times when he’d move slowly, when he’d drive to the rim and get rejected by Amir Johnson, when you’d notice there was no lift on that jumper. Which all led to the conclusion that it was preseason, and it doesn’t matter.\n“I’m healthy, yeah. I’m healthy. I’m healthy,” Anthony says after a rough night in Friday’s preseason finale in Boston. “So for me, I’m excited to go into the regular season healthy. That was my No. 1 thing to be healthy going into the regular season to continue my rehab. This week was kind of my last week of kind of my rehab. It feels good to go into the regular season healthy.”\nIf you weren’t counting, that was six references to “healthy” in one short answer — as if repeating the word makes it more convincing, whether to the group of reporters or himself. Left unsaid is that Anthony BETTER be healthy coming off knee surgery, because if he isn’t, the Knicks are going to stink. Nobody will score. And if the Knicks stink, it’s not a giant leap into turnover and chaos.\n“I thought overall we had a good preseason,” Anthony says. “Any time you can win four out of six, we’ll take it. But that doesn’t matter anymore. And now the real deal starts.”\nAnthony already ranks 34th in the NBA’s all-time scoring rankings and has a great chance to pass Hall of Famers Larry Bird, Clyde Drexler and Gary Payton this season.\nThere’s only one player above Anthony on the list who hasn’t played more seasons: LeBron James.\nStill, Anthony has faced criticism throughout his career about not being a winning player and avoiding defense. He squashed much of that talk three years ago by leading the Knicks to 54 wins, their best regular-season finish in 16 years. But the ensuing Phil Jackson takeover coincided with a fall in public perception for Anthony, with a $124 million contract that was second-guessed before it was even signed, and with two seasons for the Knicks that might’ve been more disappointing than the Dark Ages of Isiah.\nLast season’s knee injury and the lack of production fueled the debate: Is Carmelo Anthony still elite? Should the Knicks still operate as if Carmelo Anthony is a franchise player?\n“That may be the dumbest question ever asked,” Anthony writes last month on Instagram.\nAway from social media, he’s more articulate.\n“My mentality is just to come out strong and want to get back to where I was before the injury. That’s just me motivating myself. As far as proving anything to anybody, I’m not trying to prove anything,” says Anthony. “I know what I can do. My teammates know what I can do. Guys in the NBA know what I can do. Teams know what I can do. So I’m not about going out there trying to prove anything.”\nThere are signs the Knicks have already begun transitioning away from Anthony, although he holds the cards with four years remaining on his deal and a no-trade clause. The Kristaps Porzingis draft pick was a move made for beyond the Anthony era, and the free agency haul doesn’t fit into the 31-year-old’s win-now-or-at-least-very-soon timeline.\nBut there’s been hope in Anthony’s words since the summer. Also logic concerning his knee surgery.\n“If I was a guy who kind of played above the rim and played at a fast pace and just running and jumping — that was my game, very athletic — then I’d probably be sitting here singing a different tune,” Anthony said. “But the way that I play, the way that I know how to pace myself, the way I know how to pick my spots out on the basketball court, I’m not a guy who’s playing above the rim every play so it works in my favor.”\nWhile immersed in the long days of recovery from February to July, Anthony said that he was so eager to get back on the court — so motivated to get back to life’s work — that there were extra steps taken towards prevention.\n“I wasn’t allowed to go near the court,” he says. “They had a ‘No Melo on the Court’ sign on the door. They had my picture on the door with an X.”\nNow he’s allowed back in — the player who will always need help to get it done, but who can individually save the Knicks from another disappointment like last season. And while the doubters and detractors are more widespread than ever in Anthony’s 12-year career, a lot is riding on his ability to recover from major knee surgery.\nRelated Stories NBA GMs don’t think much of Knicks or Carmelo Anthony Melo's body and mind healed — and it shows Melo 'hated' Vujacic before they became Knicks teammates Isola: Healthy Carmelo Anthony good news for Knicks coach Melo continues strong preseason form as Knicks top Wizards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:10:14.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
