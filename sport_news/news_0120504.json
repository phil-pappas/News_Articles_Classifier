The maximum value of the franchise tag set aside for the unsigned Pierre-Paul has been reduced from $14.813 million to $9.587 million, roughly $871,000 each week for the six regular-season games he’s missed.\n\"We’ll know more about that when it happens,\" coach Tom Coughlin said. \"I don’t really have a lot to talk about there.\"\nThere is doubt regarding how effective Pierre-Paul will be on the field following the July 4 fireworks accident that ended up costing him his right index finger and part of his right thumb. Pierre-Paul and the Giants likely will have to negotiate a compromise on the price for his one-year deal. A contract must be signed by Nov. 17, or Pierre-Paul would be declared out for the season.\nFELLS OUT OF HOSPITAL: The team received some good news Tuesday as tight end Daniel Fells was released from Hackensack University Medical Center after being there since Oct. 2 to receive treatment for a MRSA infection in his foot.\nFells will have a nurse with him at his home while he heals. He will continue to take antibiotics to fend off the MRSA infection that is now under control.\nTAYLOR RELEASED: The Giants have released safety Cooper Taylor, the team’s 2013 fifth-round pick. Taylor had finished his previous two seasons on injured reserve, and this season has featured the emergence of veteran Craig Dahl in the secondary.\nThe Giants return to practice today in preparation for Sunday’s game against the Cowboys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:32.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
