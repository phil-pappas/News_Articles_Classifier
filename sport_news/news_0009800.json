Two brazen gunmen turned a crowded Brooklyn beauty salon into a bloody shooting range Monday, killing a young man and wounding four other people - including an off-duty cop getting her hair done.\nThe barrage of gunfire broke out about 1:30 p.m. on Fulton St. in Fort Greene , sending terrified pedestrians in the bustling neighborhood of brownstones ducking for cover.\n\"It was like Vietnam ,\" witness Chan Lee , 55, said of the fusillade of firepower that broke out in front of his restaurant.\nThe gunslinging killers, still on the loose last night, jumped out of an SUV, taking aim at a group gathered outside the famed Cake Man Raven Confectionery shop, witnesses said.\nCops reviewing surveillance video last night said it showed the group dropping their pieces of velvet cake and scattering in all directions as the gunmen fired wildly, littering Fulton St. with spent shell casings.\nThe killers chased one of the men into the Deluxe Gallery All Natural Hair Alternative salon at 704 Fulton St., shooting him in the head in front of stunned beauticians and customers.\nA source identified the dead man as Lethania Garcia , 20, who had a Florida driver's license.\nGarcia had a pending lawsuit against the city accusing police of brutality, false arrest and imprisonment stemming from a series of arrests between June 2006 and April 2007. The city denied Garcia's allegations.\nThe shooters haphazardly sprayed bullets throughout the shop. Three bystanders inside, including unarmed off-duty cop Andrea Cox , 41, were wounded, as was a male bystander outside the shop.\nCox, who works out of the 76th Precinct in Brooklyn, suffered a bullet wound to her right toe and was treated at Bellevue Hospital . She returned home last night. Cox was getting her hair done when bullets started flying.\n\"She's under a lot of medication. She's kind of traumatized,\" said Eric Rivera , a friend who answered the door at her home.\nThe 30-year-old owner of the salon said workers and customers, including Cox, rushed into a room at one end of the shop when they first heard gunfire. He said the intended victim swept in and followed them into the room, where one of the gunmen tracked him down.\n\"The guy just came in and killed him right there and other people got shot,\" said the employee, whose pants and sneakers were splattered with blood.\n\"I decided to play dead. I thought the guy was a madman just killing people,\" he said. \"Then someone said, 'He stopped shooting. He's gone.' We got up and saw the dead guy on the floor.\"\nNigel Telesford , a reporter for the Trinidad Express newspaper, had just arrived at the salon to get his dreadlocks braided when the shooting broke out.\n\"I'm glad to be alive,\" said Telesford. Moments before the shooting, he was taking photos and getting an autograph from the rap star Common, who was a few doors away at a barbershop, he said.\nShovane Williams , 27, said her sister Samantha Reid Boston, 29, of Brooklyn, a hairdresser at the salon, was hit in the arm and leg.\n\"It was her day off and she went in,\" Williams said of Boston , who was being treated at Kings County Hospital .\nThe names of the two other wounded victims, including a passerby shot outside the hair salon, were not immediately released. They were both shot in the legs, police said.\nPolice said the suspects - one wearing a dark hooded sweat top, the other in a dark ball cap - piled back into the blue Chevy Tahoe and bolted from the chaotic scene.\nRegoberto Savio , 60, a neighborhood chess coach, said he heard as many as 15 shots. \"There was a pop and then a series of staccato pops,\" he said. \"It sounded like a semiautomatic.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:41:24.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
