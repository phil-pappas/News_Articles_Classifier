The Burros showed improvement offensively, hitting a .252 efficiency with 49 kills. Hunter Scott led the team with 19, adding a .302 hit efficiency. “Hunter had really solid hitting tonight,” said BHSassistant coach Gary Beckstrom.“She made few errors and did really well offensively.” Blocking was a focal point for the Burros in this contest, and they improved from that. Olivia Henden and Lindsey Berry had four, and Rachel Fortney had three blocks in the match. Morgan Jones and Abbie McCormick also spread around the court defensively, with 17 and 13 digs, respectively. The Burros will return home to host Apple Valley on Monday. Having faced them before (Burroughs lost on the road 3-1), they know to expect a hard-hitting offense and heavy defense. “We have to look to kill the ball; find kinks in their armor,”Beckstrom said.
