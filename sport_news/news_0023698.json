( Go here to listen to postgame analysis from The Plain Dealer's Dennis Manoloff and Cleveland.com's Dan Labbe.)\nA Browns apologist might argue the team could be 4-2 or even 5-1, letting possible victories slip away against the Raiders, Chargers and Broncos.\nLetting victories slip away is the Browns way, unfortunately. You are what your record says you are.\nThe Browns had opportunities: They took a 20-16 lead in the fourth quarter when linebacker Karlos Dansby returned an interception of Peyton Manning for a touchdown.\nIt was a lead that lasted only seconds: On the first play of the Broncos' next drive, Manning hit Emmanuel Sanders for a 75-yard touchdown.\nAfter getting to overtime, the Browns got another interception of Manning but could do nothing with it. The next time he got the ball, Manning drove the Broncos to the winning field goal.\nBrowns’ Josh McCown on his two interceptions in loss to Broncos Cleveland Browns quarterback Josh McCown talks about his two interceptions in the 26-23 loss in overtime to the Denver Broncos at FirstEnergy Stadium. His first interception was a pick-six. The second, at the end of regulation, ended the chance to win then. Sunday, Oct 18, 2015. Dave Andersen, Northeast Ohio Media Group\n\"To be on the brink of a heck of a win and to not be able to finish it, it's a tough deal,\" Browns coach Mike Pettine said . \"Look in the players' faces, you see the disappointment. We said all week that playing a team like that, they minimize your margin for error, and we just made too many mistakes to come away with a win. ... It's frustrating to be at home and be that close, and come up short.\"\nHad the Browns won, \"It would've been a season-changer,\" linebacker Paul Kruger said. \" ... That's why this is a brutal loss. It doesn't mean we don't have everything in front of us. We have a lot of division games left, lot of football left, it's not a hang-your-head type of a loss. At the same time, that was a really big game that would've created a lot of momentum for us.\"\nMary Kay Cabot and Tom Reed discuss the lack of offense early in the game Mary Kay and Tom respond to a tweet about the Browns playing like the Browns, it just took a little longer in today's game.\nThis kind of talk doesn't impress Cleveland.com beat writer Tom Reed , because it's been heard for far too long in Cleveland:\nThe Browns have been talking about changing the culture here for more than decade. You don't accomplish it with slogans and mantras and signing free agents from successful franchises. You do it by finishing games like Sunday after winning ones like last week in Baltimore. It's what fosters belief in each other. It's what builds muscle memory for players who find ways to triumph even when they are far from their best.\nWith the culture of losing with the Browns, Plain Dealer columnist Terry Pluto said \"you could feel it coming\" against Manning and the Broncos ... the familiar feeling that an agonizing loss was ahead :\nThat's the problem with following the Browns. There are times when you know ... just know deep in your bones ... that your team won't win. Especially when the team facing the orange helmets is the Denver Broncos. ... The Browns were so close to knocking off the undefeated Broncos. They were so close to making their record 3-3 and raising the hopes and heartbeats of everyone who bleeds Cleveland Browns orange. So close.\nMary Kay Cabot and Tom Reed discuss the Browns two-point play Mary Kay and Tom respond to a tweet that suggested the Browns should have kicked for the extra point instead of the failed two-point conversion attempt in the fourth quarter.\nAfter the loss, quarterback Josh McCown said \"It makes me sick\" and took much of the blame. ( Go here to read Dennis Manoloff's QB report. ) McCown did not play horribly ... he had two touchdown passes to tight end Gary Barnidge ... but he also threw two picks, one returned for a touchdown and the other on a terrible throw with less than a minute to play, ending any chance to win in regulation.\n\"I was just stepping up trying to throw the ball out of bounds and avoid a sack so we could keep moving up to get in field goal range and win that thing, and I just didn't get enough on the ball when I threw it,'' McCown said. \"So it just makes me sick because there was an opportunity there in regulation to win.''\nBrowns explain why they went for failed two-point conversion in 4th quarter in OT loss to Denver Cleveland Browns head coach Mike Pettine and left tackle Joe Thomas talk about why they went for a failed two-point conversion in the fourth quarter instead of kicking the extra point, which in hind sight, would have won the game in regulation against the Broncos . Sunday, Oct 18, 2015. Dave Andersen, Northeast Ohio Media Group\nBut some are pointing fingers at Pettine for deciding to go for a 2-point conversion after Dansby's touchdown return, which failed. Had the Browns kicked the extra point, they would have taken a 24-23 lead on Travis Coons' 26-yard field goal with 3:21 remaining. Plain Dealer columnist Bud Shaw comes to Pettine's defense :\nThe Browns didn't lose because they failed to convert for two, or because after an offsides penalty moved the ball a yard closer they eschewed a handoff (Robert Turbin?) and threw incomplete. They lost because Manning made one of his best throws of his modest season, a 75-yard TD to Emannuel Sanders against solid coverage, on the next play. ... Killing Pettine for his decision presumes Denver would've failed at its own two-point conversion after the Sanders TD. Leading 22-21, they almost certainly would've gone for two. It glosses Josh McCown's terrible interception near midfield with 53 seconds remaining in regulation. ... You've seen this movie enough to know there's never one culprit.\nMcCown did not play his best. Should that resume calls to replace him with Johnny Manziel? Don't tell that to former CBS analyst Bill Cowher : He says the Browns should send Manziel packing after his latest off-the-field incident :\n\"I've watched Johnny Manziel now for a year and a half and I think he's a backup quarterback at best. And he's a distraction off the field,\" Cowher said on The NFL Today. \"And listen, I believe in second chances but after the second chance, to me there's a zero-tolerance policy. He can't put himself into the position he put himself into. I would ask for his release and I would do it for this reason: in that locker room players want accountability ... and that's the message that needs to be sent right here, that you're accountable for your actions both on the field and off the field.\"\nSpeaking of \"you are what your record says you are\" ... the Broncos are 6-0, which is hard to believe. Denver Post columnist Mark Kiszla knows there's some luck involved with this, but he's not complaining. Still, he writes there is some tension between Manning and offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak:\nThe cause is a Super Bowl ring. The Broncos cannot win a ring unless their offense improves. But here's why Manning and Kubiak are indeed lucky: If there were two or three losses on the record, and Broncos Country was howling louder about how either Manning was too old or Kubiak was too stubborn, there would be the real potential for real destructive tension. At 6-0, however, the ultimate goal of a championship makes it far easier to set aside egos, philosophical differences or anything that might drive a wedge between Kubiak and Manning.", "external_links": ["http://www.denverpost.com/kiszla/ci_28988655/manning-kubiak-marriage-uneasy-but-broncos-undefeated"], "published": "2015-10-19T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:48:17.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
