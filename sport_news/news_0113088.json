TORONTO — Troy Tulowitzki, Josh Donaldson and the slugging Toronto Blue Jays were eager to return to their homer dome after dropping the first two games of the AL Championship Series in Kansas City.\nThey showed everyone why.\nThe Blue Jays came out swinging and their rowdy fans were singing from the start, with Tulowitzki and Donaldson connecting in a six-run third inning as Toronto roughed up Johnny Cueto and the Royals for an 11-8 victory that cut Kansas City’s lead in the best-of-seven series to 2-1.\n\"That’s really what we’re all about,\" Jays manager John Gibbons said. \"We needed that breakout.\"\nVeteran knuckleballer R.A. Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the series this afternoon. He faces Kansas City’s 6-foot-10 right-hander, Chris Young.\nThe 49,751 fans serenaded Cueto with a sing-song \"Cueto-Cueto!\" chant from the game’s first pitch and never quieted down.\nRyan Goins also homered and had a two-run single one game after his misplayed pop fly set off Kansas City’s winning rally Sunday.\n\"He’s been carrying that load around a little bit,\" Gibbons said of Goins. \"But he stepped up, really got us on the board with that great at-bat, picking up those two runs, base hit to left, and then, of course, the home run.\"\nThe resilient Royals tried to come back this time, too, scoring four runs in the ninth, capped by Kendrys Morales’ two-run homer off Roberto Osuna. before Osuna closed it out.\nEven with a big lead, Tulowitzki lost his cool. He was given a rare playoff ejection for arguing balls and strikes before the top of the eighth.\nTulowitzki, who struck out looking in the seventh, was restrained by teammates as he argued with plate umpire John Hirschbeck when the Blue Jays took the field for the eighth. Gibbons and bench coach DeMarlo Hale also came out to break it up. Cliff Pennington replaced Tulowitzki, entering at second base, while Goins moved from second to shortstop.\nDespite being outhit, 15-11, by the pesky Royals, Toronto pounced on Kansas City’s pitching in the first ALCS game in Toronto since 1993 for their most runs ever at home in the postseason.\nKansas City scored four times off starter Marcus Stroman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:46:27.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
