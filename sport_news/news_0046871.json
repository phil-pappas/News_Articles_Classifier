Anderson as starters and would divide carries as equally as possible. That's a horror for fantasy owners of both players since neither would get the workload of the average starting running back and scoring opportunities could be luck of the draw.\nBut I'm not buying it, Kubiak.\nCoaches often say one thing publicly and do something else on the field. Kubiak named Hillman his offensive player of the game Sunday after his 103-yard effort that included a 72 yard touchdown run down the sideline.\nHillman provided a boost to a struggling offensive line and a rushing attack that had averaged 57 yards per game through three weeks. He appears to have more elusiveness than Anderson, who also has been dinged up.\nAnd it just feels like Anderson's losing his grasp on the job. Not only should Anderson owners feel comfortable picking up Hillman, but they should start Hillman over Anderson for the time being. Hillman seems better equipped to make big plays despite the offense's deficiencies, which makes him the No. 1 priority on the waiver wire this week.\nI wouldn't discard Anderson, however. He's a more powerfully built back who's better suited as a pass protector and inside and short-yardage rusher. Kubiak likely knows his best option to establish a physical running attack and preserve Manning long term rests with Anderson.\nUnless Hillman proves otherwise.\n2. Duke Johnson, RB Browns\nJohnson is basically a stash until the schedule lightens up in the second half of the season. Isaiah Crowell has been a mauler, but coaches apparently don't see the potential in him that they envision in Johnson.\nSunday was a sign of how they plan to use him -- as a run- and pass-catching threat, moving around the field and letting him use his natural gifts, which he displayed on his first career touchdown catch .\n\"Anytime you have a back that can be a first or second down back between the tackles, and a guy that you can also split out your number one wide out and hit him on a vertical route, that puts a lot of stress on a defense,'' said coach Mike Pettine, according to cleveland.com . \"He certainly will be a big part of our plans moving forward. That's a pretty good glimpse of how we'll be using him.\"\n3. Allen Hurns, WR, Jaguars\nIs it possible for Hurns and Allen Robinson to have big games in the same week? It certainly seems like it has to be one or the other, though Hurns likely was helped by Robinson's matchup against Colts cornerback Vontae Davis on Sunday. Don't get too happy, though, or entertain notions of dropping Robinson for Hurns. Hurns received 15 targets on Sunday but had only four in each of the previous two weeks.\n4. Blake Bortles, QB, Jaguars\nBortles is owned in 3.5 percent of nfl.com leagues and 19.7 percent in ESPN leagues. He plays at Tampa Bay, then home against the Texans and Bills, three teams that have given up a combined 25 touchdowns to opposing quarterbacks. Bortles also might get back tight end Julius Thomas, who has been out since the first preseason game with a broken hand. Thomas was evaluated by doctors Monday and the team will update his status for Week 5 on Wednesday.\n5. Tavon Austin, WR, Rams\nI'm not ready to jump on the Austin bandwagon with both feet just yet. Austin opened eyes on Sunday after catching six passes for 96 yards and two touchdowns. Austin had been relegated to punt returns and the occasional gadget running play in his first two seasons. Mind you, he has been pretty effective in those roles, with a combined five rushing and special teams touchdowns since his rookie year, but the Rams have had a other \"hot\" receivers who have flamed out as quickly as they flashed.\n6. T.J. Yeldon, RB, Jaguars\nI apologize, there seems to be an inordinate amount of Jaguars in the column this week. Yeldon had the first 100-yard rushing game of his career with 105 against the Colts in Week 4. At some point someone in Jacksonville has to get a rushing touchdown (though I said that last year about Chiefs receivers scoring a touchdown) and that could be next week at Tampa Bay.\n7. Gary Barnidge, TE, Browns\nJohnny Manziel has his Travis Benjamin. Josh McCown has his Gary Barnidge. The tight end has had two six-catch, one-touchdown performances in consecutive weeks. The Browns don't have a lot of options for playmakers, so Barnidge is a safe buy.\n8. Richard Rodgers, TE, Packers\nIs Rodgers making tight end relevant again in Green Bay? All the numbers point to Richard Rodgers (17 targets, 110 yards, 2 TDs) being Aaron Rodgers' third favorite target behind Randall Cobb and James Jones. Just for comparison, Andrew Quarless had 77 yards and one touchdown on 11 targets by this point last year.\nQuarless didn't do much more the rest of the season, but then the position hadn't meant much to Green Bay's offense since 2011.\nYear: Tight end (team receiving rank) -- Yards-touchdowns\n2015: Richard Rodgers (3rd) -- 110-2 (through four games)\n2014: Andrew Quarless (5th) -- 323-3\n2013: Andrew Quarless (5th) -- 312-2\n2012: Jermichael Finley (4th) -- 667-2\n2011: Jermichael Finley (3rd) -- 767-8\n9. Doug Baldwin, WR, Seahawks\nBaldwin is the fantasy football equivalent of that iffy looking leftover sandwich that you've passed over a few times but now there's nothing else in the fridge and you really don't feel like cooking but you're too hungry to wait on delivery so you decide to bite the bullet (perhaps literally?) and go for it. Baldwin's numbers can be feast or famine (well, midnight snack or famine), but you could do worse for a flex. Right now, he has more points on ESPN (30) than Brandin Cooks (19) or Sammy Watkins (15).\n10. Kamar Aiken, WR, Ravens\nAiken has had one decent game (89 yards against the Raiders) and one good game (77 yards and a touchdown against the Steelers), but for Joe Flacco, he may be the only game in town. Steve Smith Sr. is week-to-week with a back injury, Michael Campanaro (back) is out for the season and Marlon Brown just isn't a factor. We'll see if Aiken, a former practice squad player, can step up into the No. 1 role, but he won't lack for opportunities.\nplthompson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ _phil_thompson\n Fantasy Sports Ronnie Hillman Tavon Austin Fantasy Football Games Andrew Quarless Jermichael Finley ESPN", "external_links": ["http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2015/10/watch_duke_johnsons_first_care.html", "http://twitter.com/_phil_thompson", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2015/10/duke_johnson_cleveland_browns.html", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56140df7/turbine/ct-week5-fantasy-football-waiver-wire-20151005"], "published": "2015-10-06T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T16:00:50.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
