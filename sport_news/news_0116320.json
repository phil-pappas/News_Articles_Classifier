He made a lot of good saves,\" Giroux said. \nThe Flyers were badly outshot and looked rusty in the first period. Maybe it was the five-day layoff. Or maybe it was because they were facing a speedy, relentless Dallas team that leads the NHL in goals per game. \nDallas had a 14-7 shots domination in the first period and took a 1-0 lead on a bizarre goal with 51.8 seconds left in the session. \nFrom deep in his own zone, Dallas defenseman John Klingberg fired the puck off the side boards in the Flyers' end. Flyers defenseman Brandon Manning failed to corral the bouncing puck, and Jamie Benn got a piece of it and sent a slow bouncer in front to Tyler Seguin, who batted a knuckleball-like shot that beat Steve Mason to the short side. \n\"I saw the replay and I think it was kind of a lucky bounce,\" Giroux said. \"We wish we had [that luck] tonight. I'm sure soon we're going to have those bounces.\" \nThe goal was the first allowed by the Flyers in two-plus home games this season, ending a scoreless streak of 139:08 at the Wells Fargo Center and 151:13 overall. \nEleven seconds into the second period, Benn and Seguin again teamed for a goal. Seguin fed Benn, who broke in on a two-on-one and scored his sixth goal in six games, whipping a shot from the left circle. \n\"I felt more comfortable as the game went on,\" said Mason, playing for the first time in 10 nights. \"It was nice to get back out there and get my feet back under me.\" \nAfter a family medical development caused him to miss two games, Mason returned to the lineup for the first time since Oct. 10, when he allowed four goals in the first 6:46 and was removed from the game, an eventual 7-1 defeat in Florida. Later, it was revealed he was dealing with a family emergency. \nMichal Neuvirth had consecutive shutouts - blanking Florida, 1-0, and the defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks, 3-0 - while Mason was unable to play. \nThe Stars swarmed in the first 25 minutes before the Flyers finally applied some power-play pressure after Antoine Roussel decked Sam Gagner and got two more penalty minutes than the Flyers' forward. (Gagner went after Roussel because of a nasty center-ice hit he delivered to Brayden Schenn.) \nDuring the ensuing power play, Niemi made six saves, including close shots by Voracek and Giroux.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:17:19.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
