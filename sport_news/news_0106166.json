From worrying if they were even going to be fielding a team because of low numbers to 3 straight undefeated regular seasons, the Skyhawks journey has been pretty enjoyable for everyone involved.The Shiloh Christian Skyhawks are heading to the postseason with a perfect record. Just as in 2013 and 2014. But it didn't used to be that way before Funnon Barker and Jeff Carlson joined the coaching staff. \n\"Football, before we were scrounging to get kids to come out. One year we were thinking of not having a team because we didn't have enough kids. Once Barker and Carlson showed up they started getting people into the football thing I guess you could say,\" Dawson Fagerland says. \n\"When I first came to Shiloh the varsity team went 6-3 and they made the playoffs for the first time. Once people started to see the success that the football team, then more and more people wanted to go out every year,\" Chad Coulter says. \nCoach Barker is quick to deflect praise on the program he oversees to his players. \n\"Football is more a part of the culture of Shiloh now then when I first came here. That goes to the kids. They've done a terrific job. Not only getting each other to keep playing and to get our numbers up. They talk to the elementary kids. They talk to the middle school kids.\" \nIt used to be weird when Shiloh won a game now if the Skyhawks lose, it's not expected. That was the case in 2013 in the semifinals with Westhope and in 2014 in the state championship with Cavalier \n\"It drives us a lot. A lot of us seniors played in both of those games and we took those losses personally. Every year we've taken steps to get better and we've gotten one step further. This year we want to end with a state title,\" Matt Fettig says. \nWith three straight undefeated regular seasons, Shiloh would love to end the whole season with no blemishes, something that would be huge for kids who remember the lean years \n\"It means a lot. This program a few years ago before I first came here we won one or two games a year. Now when we lose a game, it's a disappointment. It shows how much growth this program has had since Coach Barker and Coach Carlson have come here.\" \nShiloh has a bye this weekend in the first round of the playoffs. They'll play the winner of LaMoure-LM and New Rockford-Sheyenne next Saturday the 24th.
