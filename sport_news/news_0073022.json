There is reportedly no tension between Mattingly and the team’s front office, as the manager felt he was treated well and the Dodgers’ brass is quite fond of him. \nMattingly won three consecutive division titles in LA, but a payroll that is north of $300 million has left the team with incredibly high expectations. The mentality has basically been World Series or bust since Magic Johnson’s ownership group purchased the Dodgers back in 2012. \nHeyman notes that Mattingly wants to keep managing and the Miami Marlins are one team that is already said to be interested. \nMattingly managed the Dodgers for five seasons after taking over for his close friend Joe Torre. He compiled a record of 446-363 during that span. He managed to hold the team together through some situations that could have ended a lot worse, most recently with Andre Ethier being the odd man out in the outfield. Ethier was shown at camera screaming at Mattingly in the dugout during Game 5 of the NLDS.
