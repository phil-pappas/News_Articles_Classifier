The NFL record for the most 5-0 teams in a single season is five, set in 2009.\n___\nSTREAKS & STATS\nGreen Bay's Aaron Rodgers threw two TD passes, including a 65-yarder to James Jones, in the Packers' 24-10 win over St. Louis. Since becoming the starting QB in 2008, Rodgers has 31 touchdown passes of at least 50 yards, the most in the NFL over that span. Rodgers' streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis' pick of a tipped ball for the Rams. Rodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third. The Packers had their first four-interception game since Sept. 13, 2012 in a game against Chicago. ... Bears coach John Fox improved to 8-1 against Kansas City. Most of those wins came with Denver. ... The Bears' Jay Cutler needs three TD passes to surpass Sid Luckman (137) for most in franchise history. ... The Bills' Tyrod Taylor became only the second quarterback since 1966 and fifth ever to throw for at least 100 yards, run for at least 70 and catch a pass. ... Mario Williams' sack of the Titans' Marcus Mariota in the second quarter gave him 40 with the Bills in 53 games, making him the second-fastest to 40 sacks in Buffalo. Only Bruce Smith was faster with 40 sacks in 48 games. ... The Seahawks allowed a touchdown on the opening drive, ending Seattle's streak of 20 defensive possessions without allowing a touchdown. The 17-point collapse matched the biggest in Seattle history. ... The Buccaneers' 38-31 win over the Jaguars snapped an 11-game home losing streak that dated to December 2013, the same month the Jaguars began a road skid that stands at 12. The Broncos' Peyton Manning has more interceptions (seven) than TD passes (six) through five games for the first time since his rookie season. The Broncos have won 14 straight road games against a division opponent. ... The Lions (0-5) have the distinction of being the NFL's only winless team, for a second straight week, and are off to their worst start since becoming the league's only 0-16 team in 2008. ... The Lions' Matthew Stafford and Dan Orlovsky combined to set an NFL record with 70 pass attempts in a regulation game, surpassing the 69 thrown by Vinny Testaverde of the New York Jets in a 2000 loss to Baltimore, according to STATS.\n___\nMILESTONES\nThe Falcons improved to 5-0 with a 25-19 overtime win against Washington. The Falcons, who trailed in the fourth quarter against the Redskins, are the first team in NFL history to start 5-0 with four of those wins coming when trailing at some point in the fourth quarter. ... The Bengals overcame a 24-7 deficit to beat the Seahawks 27-24 in overtime. It was the second time Cincinnati had overtime a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter and won, according to STATS. The Bengals also did it at Baltimore in 2004 for a 27-26 victory. Cincinnati overcame an 18-point deficit to beat Arizona 24-21 in the 1997 season. The Bengals are one win shy of matching the best start in club history. They went 6-0 in 1975 and 1988. ... Calvin Johnson became Detroit's career leader in receptions. He caught five passes for a total of 675. Herman Moore had 670 for the Lions.\n___\nSIDELINED\nIf the preliminary diagnosis on Jamaal Charles' injured right knee is correct, the Pro Bowl running back for the Kansas City Chiefs could be done for the season with a torn ACL. Charles' knee buckled as he tried to cut to the left in the third quarter of Kansas City's 18-17 loss to the visiting Chicago Bears. Charles will have an MRI on Monday. He missed most of the 2012 season after tearing the ACL in his left knee. Two other big-name players who exited were a pair of pass rushers: DeMarcus Ware of the Broncos, and Elvis Dumervil of the Ravens. Ware left on a cart with an injured back during the first half against Oakland. Dumervil hurt his groin in the first half against Cleveland, and was joined on Baltimore's sideline by DBs Lardarius Webb (thigh) and Will Davis (knee).\n___\nSPEAKING\n\"We overcame a lot of things in this game. Down the line, this will be motivation for us that we'll be able to look back on. We've been in this situation, and we've overcome it.\" — Bengals cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick on his team's rally from a 17-point deficit to beat the Seahawks 27-24 in overtime.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCONNECT 20 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
