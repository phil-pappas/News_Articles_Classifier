The result of the play was a fractured right fibula for Tejada. \nUtley reached out to Tejada after the game, offering an apology . However, the damage was already done and Utley had already become Public Enemy No. 1 for a move many labeled as dirty. \nOn Sunday, Major League Baseball announced Utley would be suspended for the next two games for his slide into second base. MLB chief baseball officer Joe Torre issued the following statement in a press release: \n“I recognize that there has been much commentary and many questions regarding the unfortunate play in last night’s game in which Ruben Tejada was injured. As I said after the game, the determination of whether a baserunner has intentionally interfered with a player attempting to turn a double play is left to the judgment of the Umpire on the field, and that judgment call is not subject to review. I should add that determining where to draw the line between an illegal slide and a legitimate hard play is an extremely difficult call for our Umpires.” \n“However, after thoroughly reviewing the play from all conceivable angles, I have concluded that Mr. Utley’s action warrants discipline. While I sincerely believe that Mr. Utley had no intention of injuring Ruben Tejada, and was attempting to help his Club in a critical situation, I believe his slide was in violation of Official Baseball Rule 5.09 (a)(13), which is designed to protect fielders from precisely this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.” \n“We have been in discussions with the Players Association throughout the year regarding potential rule changes to better protect middle infielders, and we intend to continue those discussions this offseason.” \nAs Ken Roesnthal notes , Utley will appeal the suspension using examples of similar slides that did draw punishment. \nHowie Kendrick started the first two games of the series at second base for the Dodgers, with Utley appearing as a pinch hitter both days. He appeared in 34 games for the Dodgers during the regular season after being acquired from the Phillies via trade in August.
