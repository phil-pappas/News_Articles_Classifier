In a game where field position, strong defense and turnovers told the story, the visiting Dragons pulled out a 14-7 win over rival Shelby to claim first place in the West Division for the upcoming Tri-County Conference playoffs that begin Oct. 28. Crest (4-1, 3-0 league) gave up an early score to Shelby but held on fourth-and-two against the Blue Devils(5-1, 3-1 league) inside their 10 midway in the second period which turned the tide. “When we play them, it’s always going to come down to one play or one point,” Crest coach Robert Melton said. “They came out in the first quarter and had that 10-play drive and scored, then when we got the stop on fourth down it changed the game.” Dragons’ running back Jalin Graham then did the rest. On a day when the Crest tailback rushed for 232 yards, he broke a 52-yard scoring play late in the half to tie the score. Then with 3:23 to play, he sailed 74 yards off the right side to the end zone for the go-ahead points. Frank Kennedy kicked extra points after both Dragon scores. “Going with our heavy (offensive) set was really not in the game plan, we hadn’t practiced it that much,” Melton said, “but we went with it and Jalin ran hard.” Shelby had gone in front on its initial possession of the game. A 19-yard pass from Nick Stites to Nick Corry set up George Dunlap’s 2-yard touchdown. Caden Sheeley kicked the point after. But two turnovers in Crest territory, plus the ill-fated fourth-down pass attempt at the Dragons’ 7 foiled the Blue Devils. “We had not been in this situation,” Shelby coach Tommy Wease said. “We’d only given up eight points all year and we hadn’t had to punt. But I thought Crest played more physical than we did and their backs ran hard. We didn’t block well.” The win ensures Crest – which closes out the regular season at home against R-S Middle School -- will have a home game against the East Division runner-up in the opening round of the playoffs. Shelby will be the No. 2 seed from the West Division and will play on the road against East champion Kings Mountain in the first round on Oct. 28. The championship round will be the following Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:21:33.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
