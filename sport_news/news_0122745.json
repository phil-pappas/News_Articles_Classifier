But the straight-up victory is not what this is about here in this space. It’s about the points, and in this matchup, six seem like too many.\nThe Jets’ 3-1 start has been fueled by two key numbers — an NFL-low 55 points allowed, and a plus-six turnover margin. However, the overall yardage numbers are reasonably close, with the Jets averaging plus-76 yards per game and the 2-3 Redskins averaging plus-46.\nMore important than that, though, is the logistical situation the Jets are in for this game. Some would say being home off a bye is a benefit. But look at it the other way: They had the long trip to England, where they used the finest American toilet paper to wipe up on the hapless Dolphins. Then another long trip followed by a week off. They are not in midseason, slug-it-out mode, and figure to be a little stale.\nThe pick: Redskins +6.\nBROWNS (+4) over Broncos: Denver is 5-0 despite Peyton Manning looking fairly decrepit. The reason is the Broncos’ No. 1-ranked yardage defense (278 yards per game), but that defense will be without DeMarcus Ware and possibly Aqib Talib. Roll with red-hot Josh McCown.\nBILLS (+3) over Bengals: Hard to know this far from game time if Tyrod Taylor will play, and if he’ll be able to move on his sprained knee. But the Bills’ pass rush will give Andy Dalton trouble, and the Bengals needed a miracle win over the Seahawks to get to 5-0. Letdown looms.\nVIKINGS (-4) over Chiefs: This line is so low, you have to be a little suspicious. But the Chiefs come in at 1-4 without Jamaal Charles. And Teddy Bridgewater has won his last five at home, including margins of 10 and 17 this season. Don’t over-think it.\nTexans (pick) over JAGUARS: Good price to get a better-quality Texans outfit. They have best player on the field when they’re on defense (J.J. Watt) and offense (DeAndre Hopkins).\nLIONS (-3) over Bears: The Lions have to win a game sometime, right? Well, in 2008, they didn’t. But this was a playoff team last year. Maybe Matthew Stafford’s in-game benching last week in a 42-17 loss at Arizona will have a positive carryover.\nCardinals (-3¹/₂) over STEELERS: Mike Tomlin showed he has brass fixtures with that game-winning run call on Monday night. But that’s a tough way to have to try to win. Michael Vick had a good fourth quarter in San Diego but will have trouble vs. the Arizona D. A good homecoming for Cardinals coach Bruce Arians, the former Steelers offensive coordinator.\nTITANS (-1¹/₂) over Dolphins: Dan Campbell will try to wake up the sleepwalking Dolphins, who have better talent than 1-3 suggests. But according to the Trend Machine, since 2000, teams that have fired their coach during the season are 6-19 straight-up and 8-17 against the spread in their next game.\nSEAHAWKS (-7) over Panthers: Carolina is 4-0 and allowing just over 17 ppg, but you don’t want to be the team that has to go to Seattle the week after the Seahawks blew a 24-7 lead in the fourth quarter. Wrong place, wrong time.\nChargers (+10¹/₂) over PACKERS: Don’t usually go with the visitor at Lambeau, but this one stat stands out: The Packers are 5-0 and are plus-47 yards per game. The Chargers are 2-3 and are plus-59 yards per game. That suggests we’re in for a back-and-forth QB duel between Aaron Rodgers and Philip Rivers.\n49ERS (+2¹/₂) over Ravens: First meeting since the Harbaugh Bros. Super Bowl. Colin Kaepernick may have turned a corner in the second half vs. the Giants, leading TD drives of 88, 80 and 80 yards.\nPatriots (-10) over COLTS: This looks like an inflated price, particularly if Andrew Luck were to return. But consider the Patriots have dedicated this season to punishing everyone for Deflategate. And the one game they circled was this one. Tom Brady said he doesn’t see this as revenge for Colts GM Ryan Grigson tipping off the NFL about the deflated balls. Yeah, right.\nMonday night EAGLES (-4) over Giants: Injury questions on both sides for the Giants. Prince Amukamara, Robert Ayers and possibly Jon Beason will be missing from the defense, and it’s too soon to know what Odell Beckham Jr. and Rueben Randle will be able to do. Eagles put up 39 points last week. It was against the terrible Saints, but could be the igniter for their offense.\nBest bets: Patriots, Vikings, Texans\nLock of the week: Patriots (Locks 3-1 in 2015)\nLast week: 11-2-1 overall, 2-0-1 Best Bets\nThursday night: Falcons\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bettor's guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:56:08.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
