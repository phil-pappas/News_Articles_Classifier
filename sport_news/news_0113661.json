Three years ago, he transferred to Memphis from Arkansas-Pine Bluff and fought for repetitions on the scout team.\nThose three players — Alan Cross, Anthony Miller and Mose Frazier — are part coincidence and part proof. When Justin Fuente arrived at Memphis in 2012, he knew that walk-ons would play a key role in the growth of the program. He and his staff sought out players who were overlooked or undervalued. He knew they were out there, many of them right in Memphis.\nHowever, Fuente did not know that so many of those walk-ons would one day be catching passes.\n\"You'd think there would end up being a lineman or a DB, it'd be mixed in there,\" Fuente said jokingly.\nInstead, most of Lynch's primary targets this season are players who did not come to Memphis with a scholarship. In addition to Cross, Frazier and Miller, sophomore wideout Phil Mayhue and senior Tevin Jones also originally walked on to the team. Those five players caught 28 of Lynch's 39 completions Saturday in what was Memphis' first win over a ranked team since 1996.\n\"The way our team works, it doesn't matter if you're a walk-on or a scholarship player,\" Miller said Saturday. \"If you can contribute, then you'll be on the field.\"\nElsewhere on the field, other walk-ons played important roles with less fanfare. Christopher Roberson, a walk-on from Central Baptist School, started at left guard Saturday and played all 94 snaps. Punter Spencer Smith, another walk-on, downed two of his four punts inside the Rebels' 20-yard line.\nFuente said director of player personnel Adam Lechtenberg deserves much of the credit for Memphis' walk-on program, as does assistant head coach Darrell Dickey, who recruits many of the local high schools. Their efforts have helped the Tigers attract players like Miller, who came to Memphis because he did not have any scholarship offers from Football Bowl Subdivision schools.\n\"No other school wanted me,\" Miller said. \"I just give glory to God that Coach Fu gave me the opportunity to be here.\"\nFuente said the Tigers do not distinguish between preferred and non-preferred walk-ons like some other schools. What constitutes a preferred walk-on, and what that term means, can vary from school to school depending on the coach.\n\"We just try and get good kids in our program that want to work hard and do the right thing,\" Fuente said.\nTiger Insider\nMemphis graduate Akeem Davis announced on Twitter that he signed a contract with the New Orleans Saints on Tuesday. Davis is now one of nine former Tigers on NFL rosters.
