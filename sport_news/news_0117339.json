They would then discuss what happened.\n\"I think we have some experience and we just need to have a calm approach and a firm approach of how we would like them to compete,\" he added.\nHamilton and Rosberg have been friends and rivals since their karting days but went through a glacial phase last year when the title battle went down to the wire.\nThey mended fences and there have been fewer flare-ups since, with Hamilton leading this year's championship all the way, but the rivalry remains fierce.\n\"They are enemies in the same team and it is clear that we cannot expect him (Rosberg) to cheer up in such a situation,\" said Wolff.\nRosberg, unsmiling and unresponsive on the podium, told reporters that what Hamilton had done at the start was \"not good\" but the Briton defended himself.\n\"I didn't try and push him out, it wasn't intentional,\" he said. \"I don't feel like I was aggressive. At the end of the day I was on the inside so it was actually my line.\n\"Growing up, as a family, we never had anything handed to us. We always had to grab with both hands and push for it. I was going to take him anyway. Somehow I was going to get past him in those (last) 10 laps.\"\n(Editing by Tony Jimenez )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:43:58.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
