There’s also nothing a 15-year-old can do when his favorite team’s best hitter goes down looking at a curveball in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series. \nFor more than two decades, Steven Matz was another helpless Mets fan cheering and losing from his family’s home on Long Island, cycling through the difference-making daydreams of every kid who sided not with the behemoths in the Bronx but with the underdogs in Queens. \nEvery kid wants to be the one to save the day, and on Tuesday night, Matz gets his chance. \nIn the game that could determine this National League division series, the 24-year-old Matz will start for the Mets against Dodgers’ ace Clayton Kershaw. \nWhat his younger self might think of a moment like this is lost to time and adolescence. \n“That's a tough question,” Matz said. “I mean, I don't really remember what I was thinking back then, but I do remember watching it and thought it was pretty awesome. You know, my dream was always to play in the Major Leagues, so it's safe to say that, yeah, that's correct, I was definitely thinking about being in that spot.” \nBecause of back spasms, Matz hasn’t pitched in a Major League game since September 24, but he pitched in an intrasquad game at the Mets’ minor league complex in Florida on Thursday and declared himself ready to go in Tuesday’s Game 4. \nHe will, essentially, complete the cycle of this young Mets’ rotation from Jacob deGrom to Noah Syndergaard to Matt Harvey to Matz. \nIt’s Matz who has the least experience of the bunch, but he’s the Game 4 choice ahead of more experienced alternatives Jonathan Niese and Bartolo Colon. \n“I watched him in Spring Training this year,” Niese said. “And from the first bullpen that I had seen him throw, I knew he was going to be really good. His stuff is electric. And then coming up into the Big Leagues, you know, being a rookie starting and having the success he has, it's not easy. You know, I remember in 2008 when I came up, it didn't go well for me. And for him to have the success he's having, being able to stay composed the way he has, it's pretty impressive.” \nIn six regular season starts, Matz went 4-0 with a 2.27 ERA. He won his debut in June, beat the Dodgers in July, and won a high-profile matchup against the Yankees in September. \nHe will be up against Kershaw, the Dodgers’ three-time Cy Young winner who will start on short rest after pitching Game 1. \n“Do you have to explain that one?” Dodgers’ manager Don Mattingly joked. \nNo explanation necessary from the Dodgers, and no questions asked of the Mets about their choice. Matz is expected to be a key piece of the team’s present and future, and after watching the 2000 World Series and 2006 NLCS from afar, he will take matters into his own hands on Tuesday. \n“You know, postseason baseball is where you want to be,” Matz said. “You want to be playing this time of year, and like I said before, I'm not really looking at it as a fan. Kind of taking the emotions out of it. We've got a job to do, and I got a job to do (Tuesday), and that's win the game. So that's just the way I'm looking at it.” 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RDkPuF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:38:54.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
