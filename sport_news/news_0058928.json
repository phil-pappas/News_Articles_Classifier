As one of the great attacking stars of the last decade and a half, would Drogba really care now, at the end of his career in MLS, to give his utmost? And at the age of 37, how much left did he have to offer?\nAdChoices All of that that was anyone’s guess.\nAs much as one could imagine Drogba, a player who has scored hundreds of goals for Chelsea and the Ivory Coast at the highest levels of soccer, being just as dominant, or even more so, in North America, one could also picture perfunctory performances — an old star expecting MLS to be easy and then, as a consequence, not caring very much to really exert himself. Many designated players, despite their prior European pedigrees, have not done well in MLS because it's a league that is unlike any other in the sport. Long air travel, very dissimilar climates (playing during the summer months rather than in the winter ones) and diverging altitudes are only some of the elements that make the league challenging for newcomers who are used to cooler and generally more comfortable conditions.\nAs Impact midfielder Patrice Bernier explained, there also is the fact that MLS is a league that features a wide range of talent, which often tends to be a source of frustration.\n“You never know what you get when you get these high-profile players because they played at a high level,” Bernier told Goal Canada. “I had a chance to talk with (Thierry) Henry and (Alessandro) Nesta and I know that there’s that bit of irritation when you’re not playing with people around you who are playing at the same level or thinking at the same level. Sometimes it can be a downer for them, even if they’re always trying to push the team forward.”\nLess than three months into his 18-month contract, Drogba has been everything the Impact could have hoped for — and much more.\nTaking no time at all to acclimate to the league, he’s helped propel the Impact into the playoffs with nine goals in 10 starts. A win over Canadian rival Toronto FC in the last game of the season Sunday could see Montreal finish as high as second in the Eastern Conference. Drogba’s physical presence in and around the box, his ability to hold up the ball and help his teammates move up the field, as well as his prowess at taking free kicks (he has three goals from dead-ball situations already), have added a completely different dimension to an Impact attack that was struggling in the weeks prior to the Ivorian’s arrival.\nPerhaps most surprising of all has been the fact that Drogba’s desire to win hasn’t seemed to have diminished and that his attitude, both on the field and off it, has been nothing but positive.\n“I think he seemed to realize quickly, to understand what type of league this is and his main objective is winning,” Bernier said. “He’s been very positive; he’s never been down, saying, ‘The situation is bad.’ He’s always thinking about what we can do to be better, what we can do to get a result.”\nAlthough primarily a goal scorer, Drogba has proven to be very willing to help track back and defend, like in the Impact’s recent away win over New England. Moreover, it's rare to see him lash out at teammates over a bad pass or a play gone wrong. In fact, he’s often the first one to recognize the positive contributions of others. After Evan Bush made a diving save to preserve a crucial win over Colorado, Drogba ran over to Bush to celebrate at the final whistle, acknowledging the goalkeeper’s heroics.\n“It speaks more to who he is as a player and what he’s here to do,” Bush said. “A lot of guys, you see it around the league, come in later in their careers and they don’t necessarily care as much about winning. You saw that with the way he reacted to the save and getting the three points that he’s totally invested in this group and this team and he wants to go all the way with us.\n“You hear all these things about him before he came about how great he is in the locker room, his leadership qualities, and he’s been everything people said he was going to be and even more so. We’re obviously excited to have him here and it couldn’t be working out better.”\nWhile Drogba has helped transform the Impact’s season, he has also helped to consistently sell out games at Stade Saputo, something the Impact had not been able to do for almost two seasons before his arrival. Many worry that the Impact will not be able to sustain anything to close to this level of supporter enthusiasm beyond Drogba’s short contract, but it’s worth noting Drogba’s own enthusiasm at being a part of the Impact.\nA video released last week via the Impact academy's Twitter account demonstrates this clearly, as an exuberant Drogba is seen gathering a group of youth players inside the Impact’s first team for a dance circle.\nIn his first days with the Impact, Drogba did his best to play down his star status. “The star is only what you see,” he said. The reality was, he insisted, that he was just a “simple guy.” After his debut, inside a booth in one of the corners of the locker room, he was sitting with a towel over his head, hiding from the swarm of reporters who were hoping to speak to him for the first time. Like a shy child in the presence of strangers, he did his best to fix his gaze elsewhere.\nBut even without him necessarily wanting the spotlight, Drogba has still very much become the star of the Impact, and the greatest one they’ve ever had. There was so much hype upon his arrival, and he’s simply living up to it.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:09:58.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
