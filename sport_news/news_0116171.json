However, he would respond in a big way with birdies on four of his final six holes, including birding three-straight from 13-15. The sophomore has logged a par or better round in seven of 10 rounds this fall. He sits just one shot off of the individual lead with 36 holes to play. \nEuler emerged on the leaderboard in a tie for eighth with a 72 on the afternoon. The freshman shook off two bogeys in the opening nine to rally for a 34 on the back nine. He posted red numbers on the par-four 12 and 16 to conclude the day at even par. \nJunior Stephen Stallings and sophomore Cooper Musselman are tied for 25th overall on the individual board following an opening round 76. Stallings ended his afternoon with a birdie on the 18th, while Musselman began his round with a birdie on the No. 1 to highlight the day. Senior David Snyder currently is tied for 40th following an opening round of 78. \nFreshman Jalen Ledger, player as an individual, sits in a tie for 34th following a 77 on the opening day of play.

Sophomore Chris Meuth was the final Wildcat in action and he is in a tie for 58th through the opening 18 holes. He notched a birdie on the par-five No. 2 to highlight his afternoon. \nThe Tournament Field: \nKentucky fired a 5-over par as a team to move into third place on the team leaderboard. Kentucky is in the hunt, just a mere five shots off of the overall leader in Lipscomb. Troy currently sits in second after a 3-over par day. Middle Tennessee State is a mere stroke back of the Blue and White, while Western Kentucky rounds out the top five through 18 holes of play with a 10-over par round. \nThe Course: \nThe Grove opened in 2012 and was designed by PGA tour player Greg Norman. His design incorporates the natural rolling hills, meandering stream beds and native grasses, which maintains the natural character of the site, while creating exciting play for golfers at every level. \nRound two of the three-day tournament will begin at 9 a.m. ET on Monday morning. The teams will play 18 holes on Monday with a final round of 18 set for Tuesday.
