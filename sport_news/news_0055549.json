They probably will be without several important players who are recovering from injuries. And even if some of them are back, they won't be close to midseason form.\nBut at least they got a few clues in a preseason loss at Cleveland on Monday about their roster. It's slowly clearing up as to who will make the 15-man team.\nThey still have to trim five players.\nDwight Powell made a strong preseason debut against the Cavaliers, and he appears to be one of the players that the Mavericks are going to keep. He is a rising young big man who can play two positions and can shoot. And he grabbed seven rebounds to go with his 11 points in 24 minutes.\nRebounding is going to be one of the Mavericks' biggest challenges this season, and anybody who can show he has a nose for the ball is going to get coach Rick Carlisle's attention.\n\"I thought Powell played hard,\" Carlisle said. \"He's a little out of rhythm, as you can expect. He's been out for so long. But a lot of good things -- he always goes hard, he's an athletic guy that knows how to play, he's got skill and we need him. So it's good to get him back.\"\nPowell suffered an elbow injury while playing for Canada in the Olympic qualifying tournament. That kept him out of practices and exhibition games until last weekend.\nThe 6-11 second-year man out of Stanford is the last remaining asset from the trade that brought in Rajon Rondo from Boston last season and cost the Mavericks a package of players and draft picks, including the probable loss of next summer's first-rounder.\nWho'd have thought Powell would have been the keeper out of that deal? He has proven to be a nice, rising talent.\nSo who doesn't make the roster? It would appear that Jamil Wilson, Maurice Ndour, Jarrid Famous and Brandon Ashley -- all of whom had flashy moments in training camp -- are long shots. The final spot could come down to centers Samuel Dalembert and Salah Mejri.\nDalembert is older and more experienced. Mejri, 29, a rookie, is full of potential but raw and not as strong as Dalembert.\nThose who have roster spots sealed up: Projected starters Dirk Nowitzki, Chandler Parsons, Zaza Pachulia, Wesley Matthews and Deron Williams; and reserves Devin Harris, J.J. Barea, Jeremy Evans, Charlie Villanueva, JaVale McGee, John Jenkins, Justin Anderson, Raymond Felton and Powell.\nThat leaves one spot for either Mejri or Dalembert.\nBriefly: The preseason home finale is Wednesday against Phoenix. The 0-5 Mavericks then conclude their exhibition schedule Friday at Lincoln, Neb., against Chicago. ... Final cuts have to be made by Monday at 4 p.m., but expect the Mavericks to make cuts perhaps as early as Saturday to allow players to clear waivers quicker and perhaps catch on with another team.\nTwitter: @ESefko\nOn Twitter:\n @ESefko", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ESefko"], "published": "2015-10-21T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:58:50.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
