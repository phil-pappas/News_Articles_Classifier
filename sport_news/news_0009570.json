A survey released this summer by the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks found 40 percent more pheasants in South Dakota fields than last year. \nIf traffic at the Super 8 in Huron is any indication, wildlife officials may be right in predicting more pheasant hunters this season compared with the last two. \n\"Well, we're full for the next three weeks, so it looks like we're going to do quite well this year,\" general manager Inez Muilenburg said. \nMuilenburg says about 75 percent of her visitors come every year regardless. The rest fluctuate based on bird counts which are up this year. They're well above counts from two years ago, which were the lowest the state had seen in decades. \nGame, Fish & Parks biologist Travis Runia says bird counts have a direct economic impact in the state. \n\"Last year it was estimated that over $150 million got spent in South Dakota directly by pheasant hunters. When we had a few more hunters back in the mid to late 2000s, it was well over $200 million were spent in South Dakota just by pheasant hunters alone,\" Runia said. \nRunia says most hunters come to South Dakota within the first few weeks of the season, so license sales early on should be a pretty good indicator of the strength of this year's season. \n\"It really sounds like there's a renewed interest for pheasant hunting in South Dakota from non-residents, so I'd expect to see a good five to ten percent increase and we'll have to wait and see if that's correct,\" Runia said. \nAt the Huron Chamber and Visitors Bureau, general manager Laurie Shelton says an annual hunting event in the community has drawn more participants this year, just one indicator more visitors could be coming. \n\"Last year we had around 5,900 hunters throughout the hunting season, so we're hoping that increases,\" Shelton said. \nLooking into the future, Runia says he isn't expecting the pheasant population to rebound to the high levels the state saw in 2007 and 2008. Still, he does expect to see what he describes as good, solid pheasant hunting. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
