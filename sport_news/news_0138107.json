Manohar has already asked for a full report of the incident from the Odisha Cricket Association.\nAlso on the agenda would be finding a new sponsor for the IPL after PepsiCo expressed its desire to end the association.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:12:27.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
