Will need to aim up defensively with Argentina adept at attacking out wide. \nArgentina: Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe is a genuine menace at the breakdown – which will be even more of a factor against an Australian team boasting the triple threat of Fardy, Hooper and Pocock. But the skilful 33-year-old is also the leading tackler for Argentina at the World Cup with 46 and carries the ball well, which opens up the field for the team’s dynamic back three. \nTeams: \nAustralia: Israel Folau, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, David Pocock, Michael Hooper, Scott Fardy, Rob Simmons, Kane Douglas, Sekope Kepu, Stephen Moore (capt), James Slipper.
