It's been a head-down week, focusing on the game. We won't look at the league table until we get a few wins. \n\"There's a long way to go in the season.\" \nIf the Magpies are to make the short journey back from Wearside with a positive result, they will have to break a losing streak against their neighbours which was extended to five games home and away by Jermain Defoe's lone strike on Wearside in April. \nHowever, McClaren, who arrived at St James' Park during the summer, will not look back to that game as he prepares his new-look team for a game in which form is often irrelevant. \nHe said: \"We don't do that on any other game, so we are not preparing for this any differently, and why should we? Why should we put any more importance on this? That would be saying that we are not putting important on any other game. \n\"In this Premier League, every game is vital and Sunday is no different. It's a little bit special because the fans are also competing against each other.\" \nMcClaren has no fresh injury concerns after defenders Paul Dummett and Massadio Haidara and midfielder Cheick Tiote emerged from the Norwich game unscathed on their return from injury. \nHe has also been boosted by the sight of defender Kevin Mbabu and midfielder Rolando Aarons to training after hamstring and calf problems respectively, although the game could come too soon for them.
