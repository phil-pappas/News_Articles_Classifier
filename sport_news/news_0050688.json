The loan was extended by IDBI, which has put the sum down as Non-Performing Asset (NPA). The loan was illegally sanctioned in violation of the company’s rules for credit limits. Mallaya, director of the now-folded Kingfisher Airlines; the company itself; its Chief Finance Officer A Raghunanthan and some unidentified people of the bank were recently booked for consipracy and corruption as part of a wider investigation into criminal default of loans public sector banks put down as NPA. Mallya is likely to be called soon for questioning. The bank will also have to explain why it extended loan to a debt-ridden company despite a warning against doing so by its own panel of experts. Unable to take losses, Kingfisher Airlines had shut down in October 2012. The airline has an outstanding debt of 7,000 crore in 17 banks in total: it owes almost a quarter of the sum — Rs 1,600 crore — to State Bank of India alone. The CBI is investigating some 27 cases of bad loans by pubic banks registered by the agency in 2013. CBI had previously claimed that bulk of the NPA was connected to 30 defaulter accounts. UB Group spokesperson confirmed raids on the company's premises. \"The CBI officials visited UB Group premises in Bengaluru, Goa and Mumbai in the course of an investigation regarding a loan facility availed by Kingfisher Airlines. The company cooperated with the officials and provided the necessary documents and will continue to offer co-operation,\" UB Group spokesperson Sumanto Bhattachrya said. United Breweries Group, which has its headquarters in Bengaluru, is the parent company of Kingfisher Airlines. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:21:04.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
