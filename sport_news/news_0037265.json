They are keen to revitalise the Australian scene in particular. \nParker won't feature on the Australian and Poland promotions with his ties linked to headlining New Zealand events but also pushing into bigger markets. Ad Feedback \nLonergan has just returned form a lengthy trip to Europe mixing business with pleasure and believes it's an area where Parker's increasing profile can be utilised. \nLonergan will attend the WBO conference in Florida at the end of the month and continue to build the American contacts for Parker in the biggest and most lucrative fight zone. \nParker fought in Germany and the United States last year. He will start 2016 with a January fight in Samoa but push further afield during the year. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:57:31.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
