Here are five things to watch this week:\nFormer NFL rushing champion to watch So much for the notion Adrian Peterson’s game would suffer from a forced year off and from turning the dreaded (for a running back) 30 in the offseason.\nAfter a mystifying opener in San Francisco in which the Vikings gave Peterson just 10 carries, he is looking like All-Day all over again.\nPeterson is back in the familiar position of leading the NFL in rushing (291 yards) and rushing average (97 yards per game) after back-to-back big days against the Lions and Chargers. His matchup Sunday in Denver against the league’s top-ranked defense looks tantalizing as a result.\nThough quarterback Teddy Bridgewater has regressed so far in his second season (he has just one TD pass in the first three games combined), he is competent enough to be the pressure valve Peterson always has lacked in Minnesota.\nThe three-year, $42 million restructured contract the Vikings gave Peterson in June also appears to have made him happy.\nThat combination of fresher legs, a more balanced offense and a better attitude looks likely to keep being very bad news for teams tasked with stopping Peterson.\nEx-Jets coach to watch Eric Mangini isn’t exactly rebuilding his coaching resume with the 49ers so far.\nWhile in-over-his-head Jim Tomsula and struggling QB Colin Kaepernick are getting most of the blame after two straight blowout losses, Mangini is due for a massive amount of second-guessing, too.\nWith the former Jets boss in his first season as defensive coordinator, San Francisco has been abysmal on that side of the ball since opening with 20-3 win over the Vikings.\nChris Johnson stiff-arms San Franciso’s NaVorro Bowman.

Not all of that hideousness was on the defense (Kaepernick opened the Arizona game with two pick-sixes), but Mangini’s unit is a disaster.\nThere already is talk Mangini’s scheme is too complicated, especially for a young defense still adjusting to a flood of offseason personnel losses, and he is under pressure to simplify it.\nWith Aaron Rodgers and the red-hot Packers next, though, it could get even worse for Mangini before it gets better.\nRejuvenated team to watch Even just a marginally better defense appears to be making all the difference in the world for the Falcons.\nAtlanta is one of the NFL’s surprise 3-0 teams heading into Sunday’s home matchup with the Texans (already half the Falcons’ win total all of last season), but the credit for the early rebound shouldn’t go entirely to the supercharged offense.\nNew coach Dan Quinn, the former Seahawks defensive coordinator, has gotten better effort and results out of an Atlanta defense that was an embarrassment the past two years.\nWith key contributions from former Cowboys linebacker Justin Durant, ex-Jets cornerback Phillip Adams and rookie pass rusher Vic Beasley, the Falcons have improved to 16th in the NFL in points allowed and 23rd in total yards.\nThough that might not sound all that impressive, it sure beats their usual spot at or near the bottom in 2013 and 2014. And with Matt Ryan, Julio Jones and Devonta Freeman powering one of the league’s most explosive offenses, it’s more than enough to make the Falcons contenders again.\nInevitable quarterback injury to watch Jets’ Quinton Coples brings down Andrew Luck. Photo: AP Though it appears Andrew Luck will rally from his mysterious shoulder injury to face the Jaguars on Sunday, it now looks highly questionable whether Luck will be able to make it through the season in one piece.\nIf it seems like Luck has taken a lot of punishment behind the Colts’ woeful offensive line, it’s because he has. According to ESPN, no quarterback in the league since Luck arrived in 2012 has taken more hits while throwing than Luck (90).\nThat’s another black mark on the record of GM Ryan Grigson, who instead of fortifying that line or Indianapolis’ porous defense in the draft last May took another undersized wide receiver in Phillip Dorsett.\nImprobable trade to watch Though the winless Bears look primed for a firesale after their moves this week, don’t look for the much-speculated trade of Matt Forte to be the next domino to fall in Chicago.\nBecause of the way Forte’s contract is structured, a team would need nearly $7 million under the salary cap to acquire him before the Nov. 3 trade deadline. And because clubs out of necessity need to budget for injuries, about $15 million in cap room is the more likely figure for teams interested in Forte.\nThat applies only to the Jaguars, Titans, Browns and Raiders, none of whom appear to be in need of an expensive half-season rental of a running back headed for unrestricted free agency.\n  adrian peterson ,  andrew luck ,  atlanta falcons ,  chicago bears ,  indianapolis colts ,  jim tomsula ,  minnesota vikings ,  new york jets ,  nfl ,  san francisco 49ers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:23:06.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
