A team can win without a foreign player. And it can also win without having to rely on a tall player.\nSan Beda, however, relied on those two attributes plus a deep bench to gain the NCAA finals for the 10th straight time.\nThe Knights, one of only two teams playing All-Filipino, survived the desperation of Mapua, 91-90, to forge a title duel with their nemesis who beat them in the finals in 2012 and 2013.\nLetran guard Mark Cruz is forced to look for an open teammate after four Mapua defenders, including frontliners Justin Serrano (No. 12) and Allwell Oraeme, gang up on him as he drives to the basket during their NCAA Final Four match at the Mall of Asia Arena yesterday. The Knights won, 91-90, to advance to the Finals. (Bob Dungo Jr.)\nAnd so for the third time in four years, the two teams, which are 1-2 in the eliminations, will again meet for the championship of the country’s oldest college league after the Bedans dispatched the Heavy Bombers, 78-68.\nWhile the top-seeded San Beda had a relatively easier time in its game against Jose Rizal University, even using second stringers in the second half, Letran had to survive Mapua’s upset bid and did it behind the heroics of Marc Cruz, the tournament’s smallest player, to escape a knockout game.\nCruz, a 5-foot-5 daredevil, delivered the dagger from near and far and held the enthralled Letran community in his fingertips with a performance of a lifetime.\nHe led all scorers with 24 points, had six rebounds and six assists in a memorable display of all-round playmaking which the Knights are now hoping he can repeat against the Red Lions on Friday in the first game of their best-of-three series.\nIt was Cruz who carried the Knights in the second half, especially when Mapua, hoping to get back to the finals after 24 years, battled with the ferocity of a team fighting for its life.\nCruz was there to deny the Cardinals as the wily guard scored 18 of his total points in that stretch while the rest of his team combined for only six. He shot three 3-pointers in the same period.\nHe was also mesmerizing attacking the basket such as when he scored on an amazing lay-up over the outstretched arms of Mapua’s Cameroonian “import” Allwell Oraeme, absorbing contact and converting the free shot.\nThis sparked an 8-0 rally which turned a 76-71 Mapua lead to a 79-76 lead for Letran, a lead the Knights never relinquished.\n“Siyempre masarap. Nobody expected us to be here (in the finals),” said Aldin Ayo, an unknown tapped to coach the Knights at the start of the season.\nBut he said the tournament is not over. They also made a statement with the victory by playing all-Filipino.\n“Sobrang gratifying. Yan kasi ang battlecry ng mga supporters namin. All-Filipino.”\nSan Beda, on the other hand, was all business after trailing, 40-48, then grabbing the lead, 56-53, on a 16-5 blast and never looked back.\nTo everyone’s surprise, San Beda coach Jamike Jarin decided not to field his starters in the fourth quarter even in the midst of repeated rallies from JRU.\nDonald Tankoua, Roldan Sara and Radge Tongco combined for 18 markers in the fourth period for the Lions.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:55:22.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
