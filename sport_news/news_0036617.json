Melissa Bachman, host of Winchester Deadly Passion , is prepared with both, as she returns to South Dakota for a chance at a giant whitetail. Rattling and decoys are just a few of the tricks up her sleeve, but she’ll have to pull from her extensive experience to maintain composure on one of her most intense bowhunts of the season. Tune in to Winchester Deadly Passion , on Sportsman Channel Sunday, October 25 at 11:30 a.m. ET. \nWatch a sneak peek here: http://www.thesportsmanchannel.com/shows/winchesters-deadly-passion/ \nBachman is familiar with whitetail hunting in East River, South Dakota, as she returns year after year, scouting the land and learning whitetail patterns. Her in-depth knowledge will bring her face-to-face with one of the biggest bucks she’s ever seen in the area. A combination of rattling, calling and decoys keep big game from wandering back into the woods. Now it’s up to Bachman to get the right shot. It’s early morning, and not quite light enough to draw her bow. The huntress must work to remain at ease as she prepares to, hopefully, harvest the biggest buck she’s seen. \n“I’d been sitting in a blind all morning, so seeing that monster buck in front of me was really exciting,” said Bachman. “The adrenaline was really kicking in, but I knew it was too dark. Timing is everything, and I had to make sure I was spot on before making any moves.” \nLearn more about Winchester Deadly Passion at http://MelissaBachman.Com on, Instagram at http://Instagram.com/Melissa_Bachman and http://Facebook.Com/WinchesterDeadlyPassion \nAbout Winchester Deadly Passion : Every good hunter needs a solid role model, and Melissa Bachman, host of Winchester Deadly Passion , fits that bill perfectly with a unique ability to share her love for hunting with passionate fans and viewers.
