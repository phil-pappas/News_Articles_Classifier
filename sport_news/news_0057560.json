(AP) - Illinois said Thursday that starting running back Josh Ferguson will miss the Illini’s game Saturday at No. 22 Iowa because of a shoulder injury. \nInterim coach Bill Cubit had said earlier this week that he doubted Ferguson would play. \nFerguson injured the shoulder early in Illinois’ 14-13 victory over Nebraska and did not return. The senior has 397 yards and three touchdowns on 71 carries for the Illini (4-1, 1-0 Big Ten). \nFreshman Ke’Shawn Vaughn took over for Ferguson on Saturday and was the only other Illini back to carry the ball. Vaughn had 98 yards on 24 carries. \nCubit has said Illinois will need junior Henry Enyenihi to help pick up the rushing load at Iowa (5-0, 1-0). \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:54:41.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
