Torgersen wasn't deemed to have suffered a concussion against the Big Green, but Penn coach Ray Priore felt that after a hit to the head the junior was too woozy to return to the game.\nThe Quakers defense should be bolstered by the return of linebacker Colton Moskal. He and fellow linebackers Tyler Drake and Donald Panciello will have their hands full trying to contain Fordham running back Chase Edmonds, who leads the FCS in rushing with 654 yards and is second in touchdowns (10). \nWhile Edmonds is the big threat, Rams quarterback Kevin Anderson is not to be taken lightly. He's fifth in the FCS with 13 passing touchdowns and has racked up 1,226 yards with a completion percentage of 61.5. Things you might not know \nFordham has won seven straight Ivy League games. \nWhen these two played last season, Penn placekicker Jimmy Gammill connected on a school-record five field goals. One of his kicks, from 48 yards, was the longest Quakers kick since 2004. \nPenn's loss last season was the Quakers' first to Fordham in six meetings. The Rams, Penn's final nonleague opponent, have never won a game at Franklin Field (0-3). \n- John N.
