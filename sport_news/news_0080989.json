The blood, sweat, and tears past players and coaches have put forth won't be lost and I look forward to continuing the success and building on it for years to come.\" \nHuddleston, a Jeff West product, was a member on both of ESU's national runner-up teams in 2006 and 2008. She hit .324 with 30 RBIs during the 2008 season. \n“When this position opened, I felt the time was right to look at our former softball student-athletes, those who built the program into what it is today, those who have invested some sweat equity, if you will,” Emporia State athletic director Kent Weiser. “April Huddleston exemplifies the hard work and passion for Emporia State softball that sets the program apart from others.” \nEmporia State has posted an overall record of 653-268 since 2000, making 11 straight regional appearances from 2004-14. \n“I would like to thank Kent Weiser for this opportunity and am excited to be back in the Hornet athletics family on a full-time basis,” Huddleston said. “I would also like to thank Julie LeMaire for our time spent together as a staff while she led the Lady Hornets and wish her the best of luck.” \nHuddleston will be formally introduced at a news conference at 10 a.m. Friday in the Blue Key Room of the Emporia State Memorial Union.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:35:25.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
