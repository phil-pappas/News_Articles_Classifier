Elmohamady passed low from the right side of the area and Meyler steered his shot in off the post.Just two minutes later the home side went further ahead when Andy Robertson beat two defenders down the left and fed Hernandez, who turned and shot home right-footed from just outside the six-yard box.Birmingham started the second half with David Cotterill and Andrew Shinnie on in a more attacking formation.The hosts were denied a penalty when Chuba Akpom appeared to be blocked off in the area - but referee Eddie Ilderton ignored the home side's appeals.Akpom forced Kuszczak to dive to his right and push away a low shot with half an hour to go as Hull searched for a third goal.Jonathan Grounds was in the right place to block a shot from Akpom as the Arsenal loan striker looked for the right finish.Clucas then hit a low shot across goal which Kuszczak dived low to save for what would been no more than a deserved third for the home side, before Shaun Maloney shot into the side-netting in what was another assured performance from Hull.
