The two come to Edmonton with impressive backgrounds and their impact on the Oilers was immediate. \nChiarelli addressed two of the Oilers’ biggest deficiencies from the past two seasons with the acquisition of goaltender Cam Talbot and the signing of free-agent defenceman Andrej Sekera. \nThe club hopes Talbot becomes a quality starting goaltender, having caddied for Henrik Lundqvist with the New York Rangers for the past two years. \nChiarelli also believes Sekera is the top-end defenceman the Oilers have been lacking during their playoff drought. They hope Sekera also acts as a mentor to the team’s younger, talented blue-liners. \nEdmonton missed the playoffs by 35 points last year, which will be tough to make up in a strong Western Conference. However, the club should be more competitive this season and, with all the off-season changes in management, will likely no longer be the laughing stock of the league. \nFORWARDS \nMcDavid joins a team already loaded with first-overall picks, which should help his transition into the league. McDavid is considered a generational talent and will be the focus of attention this season, but with Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Nail Yakupov also on the roster, the rookie will not be depended upon to provide all the offence for the Oilers. With Jordan Eberle and Benoit Pouliot in the mix as well, McDavid will have plenty of skilled forwards to play with. \nDEFENCE \nThe biggest question going into the season is whether the Oilers have done enough to shore up a blue line that conceded the most goals in the league last year. A big part of their struggles was due to the dysfunctional defensive system put in place by the previous coaching staff, so having McLellan in charge should bring about immediate improvement. The addition of Sekera will also help, but the Oilers’ progress on the blue line will be dictated by development of younger defencemen such as Oscar Klefbom, Justin Schultz, Griffin Reinhart and Darnell Nurse. \nGOALTENDING \nThe Oilers believe their goaltending issues have been resolved with the acquisition of Talbot. Just to be sure, the Oilers also acquired Anders Nilsson, who spent last season in the KHL and was unable to find a spot on the New York Islanders roster. \nCOACHING \nFormer GM Craig MacTavish rolled the dice by hiring unproven rookie coach Dallas Eakins prior to the 2013-2014 season and it backfired on him. This year, Peter Chiarelli went with a much more experienced and successful coach in McLellan to run his bench. McLellan brings instant credibility and stability. \nBOTTOM LINE \nThe Oilers will be better this year than they were the previous two years, which is not saying much considering how low the bar has been set in Edmonton. A new star player in McDavid and strong management structure has the Oilers pointed in the right direction, but it’s up to McLellan and his staff to facilitate improvement. There is little doubt the team will be much better than last season, but whether it’s enough to snap a nine-year playoff drought remains to be seen. \nUnsung hero: Matt Hendricks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:59:07.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
