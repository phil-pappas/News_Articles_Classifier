(REUTERS) \nTainted Pakistan fast bowler Mohammed Aamer has been fined 100 per cent of his match fee by the Pakistan Cricket Board for breach of discipline during a domestic cricket match in Karachi, it has been reported . Aamer, representing the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) in the qualifying round of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, has been in superb form, taking 30 wickets in just four first-class matches. The 23-year-old, desperate to make a comeback to international cricket after the spot-fixing scandal, was reprimanded by the PCB after indulging in a bitter verbal exchange with PIA’s Faisal Iqbal who allegedly called him a \"thief\". The match referee imposed fines on both Faisal and Amir. Aamer has been instructed to strictly follow the code of conduct set by the PCB to increase his chances of returning to the international scene.“Apparently Aamer was sledging Faisal and some other PIA team players during the match and at one stage the situation got out of hand and the latter reminded him of his deeds and called him a ‘Chor’ (thief),” The Nation reported quoting unnamed sources. Aamer had apparently retorted back by advising Faisal to stop relying on his uncle (Javed Miandad) and to play cricket on his own.
