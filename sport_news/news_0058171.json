He said he had trouble lifting his left arm and was replaced in the bottom of the inning by Juan Lagares.\nIt would seem unlikely that Cespedes would be out golfing if the series had been a bit tighter, but if the injury is worse than expected, New York will lose one of its most valuable weapons.\nCespedes said after the game that he has a joint issue not related to golf and he'll be fine in a few days.\nNBC Chicago's Peggy Kusinski posted a picture on Facebook of Cespedes playing his round at Medinah Country Club.\nA CALL TO VETERANS: With his team nursing a 3-0 series lead, manager Terry Collins said before Game 4 that he leaned on his veterans to make sure the team didn't get too far ahead of itself and assume the World Series was a given.\n\"Don't look for tomorrow,\" Collins said. \"Let's get this over now. Let's go out there and play our game and let's go home.\"\nReliever Tyler Clippard echoed those sentiments.\n\"You're in the moment and you're trying to win the game,\" Clippard said. \"It makes it pretty easy to just go out there and do your part and try to get it done. That's what we've done each and every night. We have a lot of confidence we're going to win each time.\"\nREVERSING THE TREND: The team was 0-7 against the Cubs in the regular season — meeting in May and July — and had not won at Wrigley in the past two seasons before dominating this series.\n\"We knew we had a big challenge in front of us. We just said going in we're a little different team than we were when we played them,\" Collins said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:59:22.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
