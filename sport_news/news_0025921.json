Playing without its two best running backs and its top wide receiver, the Bills rallied with a pair of second half touchdowns to nip the Titans 14-13 on Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor shook off an ineffective first half and was the unquestioned leader of the Buffalo comeback. Taylor ran for one touchdown and threw for another in bringing Buffalo back from a 10-0 deficit. Stephon Gilmore's interception of a Marcus Mariota pass with less than 2 minutes remaining iced the game. Buffalo improved to 3-2 with the surprising win. It doesn't get any easier next Sunday. The undefeated Cincinnati Bengals will take on the Bills at Ralph Wilson Stadium. Full game coverage, page A12.
