They’re all knock out,” Cheika said after the Wallabies secured top spot in Pool D with a courageous 15-6 denial of Wales on Saturday. \nWith their strongest side available, third-ranked Wales would ordinarily fancy their chances of toppling the fourth-ranked Springboks. \nBut Warren Gatland’s injury-ravaged Red Dragons will need to conjure something special to keep their World Cup hopes alive at Twickenham in Saturday’s first quarter-final. \nIreland against Argentina looks the tightest of the four quarter-finals and the tantalising prospect of the Wallabies needing to complete a grand slam sweep of the four home nations to make a fourth World Cup final remains a distinct possibility. \nIreland, though, also are a battered outfit and will likely need to conquer the inspired Pumas without inspirational lock and captain Paul O’Connell (leg), flanker Peter O’Mahony (knee) and goalkicking playmaker Jonny Sexton (ribs and groin). \nStar No.7 Sean O’Brien could also be in strife after replays showed the openside flanker striking French second-rower Pascal Pape in the stomach in the opening minute of the match. \nWORLD CUP QUARTER-FINALS (prefix denotes world ranking): \nSaturday: \n4-South Africa v 3-Wales at Twickenham, London (4pm local, 0200 Sunday AEDT) \n1-New Zealand v 6-France at Millennium Stadium, Cardiff (8pm, 0600 Sunday AEDT) \nSunday: \n5-Ireland v 7-Argentina at Millennium Stadium, Cardiff (1pm, 2300 AEDT) \n2-Australia v 9-Scotland at Twickenham, London (4pm, 0200 Monday AEDT)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:44:54.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
