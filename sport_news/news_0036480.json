Wexler/Staff photographer Dean Anzalone (24), Zeyad Hamza (18) and Kyle Mack (28) congratulate teammate Jimmy Conboy (9) after the second of his two first-half goals in the Maroons’ 2-0 win over Emerson in the county tournament preliminary round last Thursday. \nThe Ridgewood boys soccer team probably deserved better. \nPlaying third-seeded Tenafly in the Bergen County Round of 16, and leading throughout much of the contest, the 14th-seeded Maroons showed why they belonged among the tournament’s best. \nBut Tenafly’s goal with less than 30 seconds remaining sent the game to overtime knotted, 2-2, and after two scoreless extra periods, the Tigers edged the Maroons on penalty kicks, 4-3, Sunday in Emerson. \n\"It was definitely a really tough loss for us,\" senior captain Luke Eckels said before the team’s practice Tuesday. \"I was proud of the guys to keep on fighting and keeping it 2-2 through overtime. PK’s is a tough way to lose, but there’s nothing we can do there.\" \n\"The sting is deep,\" head coach Joe Gyulay said. \"I know our coaching staff hasn’t gotten over it and won’t forget it. It’s not something we’re going to harp on, but we’re going to learn from that.\" \nMaroons senior Nick Bigger gave his team an early 1-0 lead, which disappeared when Tenafly’s Kodai Ueyama scored before the half. However, an early second-half goal by junior Dean Anzalone put Ridgewood back on top and appeared to be the deciding tally even as the Tigers mounted a furious charge late in the game. \nBut Andres Morales scored the equalizer off a corner kick in the final minute, staving off tournament elimination and robbing the Maroons of a trip to the quarterfinals. \n\"We were almost there,\" said Eckels. \nThe Maroons fell just short in the penalty kick portion of the contest, but Gyulay acknowledged that his team showed some guts in the loss. \n\"They did a tremendous job under tremendous pressure. Being the underdog and leading the entire game was something that we proved to the county we aren’t a 14-seed,\" Gyulay said. \"I believe we should have been in the semifinals; I think that’s the caliber of talent that we have, and we just need the ball to bounce our way one or two more times.\" \nThe defeat — which is counted as a tie on the Maroons’ ledger since it went to penalty kicks — put a damper on the team’s county experience, but it still could not take away Ridgewood’s momentous win over Emerson in the preliminary round last Thursday. \nThe Maroons dominated the Cavaliers in a 2-0 win that seemed like a blowout due to Ridgewood’s suffocating defense. Senior Jimmy Conboy scored both Ridgewood goals in the first half, and goalie Thomas Benson had to make only one save, thanks to the solid defensive effort in front of him. \nThe victory was the program’s first in county play since 2011. \n\"It definitely meant a lot to everybody on the team, especially some of the seniors who hadn’t made the county tournament at all,\" said Eckels, who played significant minutes the past two seasons for teams that failed to qualify for the tournament. \nThe Maroons, ranked 15th in The Record Top 25, now turn their focus to their second go-around through Big North Freedom Division play, which began Thursday with a senior night contest at home against Paramus (after press deadline). \nThe team’s record sat at 5-2-3 entering that game, with the only losses coming against No. 2 Ramapo in double overtime and No. 9 Northern Highlands by a 1-0 margin. \n\"We haven’t lost any games by more than a goal. We’re in every game, and we know we can compete with everybody on our schedule,\" Gyulay said. \nWhile a division title might be a long shot at this point, it’s not an impossibility. Ridgewood would need to run the table in its five divisional games and root for another Ramapo loss within the division to tie the Green Raiders atop the standings. \n\"That’s our main focus right now, trying to win the [division],\" Eckels said. \"So just win the rest of our league games and play really well against those high-caliber teams like Ramapo and Highlands.\" \nLooking ahead to the state tournament, the Maroons appear to be solidly positioned in the lower half of a potential 16-team bracket in North 1, Group 4 with 157.25 power points at the start of the week. However, with three more matches to go before the 13-game cutoff, Ridgewood could climb the rankings with a few more wins. \nEmail: birchenough@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:28:32.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
