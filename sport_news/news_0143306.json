Georgia coach Mark Richt and the Bulldogs' football family: They have shown unbelievable compassion in the wake of Southern player Devon Gates breaking his neck in last Saturday's game vs. the Bulldogs in Athens. Richt has rallied support from the Georgia fan base to contribute to Gales' fund set up by Southern. Also, Georgia flew Gales' parents to Athens and escorted them to the hospital where their son underwent surgery. Hopefully, LSU will set up something at its home games to collect funds for Gates.\n2. LSU running back Leonard Fournette: Yes, I could write his name in this space every week and not get much of an argument since he's recording 200-yard rushing games like a guy out for a morning jog around LSU's campus lakes.\n3. Kentucky coach Mark Stoops: After his team collapsed down the stretch last year failing to get to a bowl, he has the Wildcats at 3-1 overall and 2-1 in the East, looking very much like a possible 7-win bowl team.\nFizzle\n1.: Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp: Auburn is loaded with defensive talent. Yet under Muschamp, the highest or one of the highest paid coordinators in college football, Auburn is last in the SEC in total defense (413.5 yards per game), last in rushing defense (216.5 ypg) and last in scoring defense (26.5 ppg). The man with the flashpoint temper known as \"Coach Boom\" has become \"Coach Boo.\"\n2. Auburn coach Gus Malzahn: The blame for Auburn's 0-2 SEC start shouldn't fall all on Muschamp. No doubt Malzahn has proven time and again that he's one of the best playcallers in college football. But he failed to develop a backup quarterback behind starter Nick Marshall last year who could step in this season after Marshall graduated. Jeremy Johnson, who Malzahn raved about in preseason, was a turnover machine in his first three starts and new starting QB Sean White, a redshirt freshman, was average in his debut last week in a loss to Mississippi State.\n3. Missouri's quarterback situation: Junior quarterback Maty Mauk, 17-5 as a starter with 18 straight starts, was suspended for Saturday's game against South Carolina for a violation of team rules. Mauk, whose father just underwent cancer surgery, has struggled this season with six TDs and four interceptions. Freshman Drew Lock, a strong pocket passer who shined in preseason scrimmages, will start in place of Mauk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:48:18.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
