They play very hard,” said La Salle coach Juno Sauler. \nThe Archers themselves were coming off a win, a 71-64 dismantling of the University of the East Warriors last Sunday. \nThe Growling Tigers trail the Far Eastern University Tamaraws at second with a 4-1 card, while the Archers are right behind at 3-2 in a tie with the Blue Eagles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:28:32.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
