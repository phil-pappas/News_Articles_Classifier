Tousignant said her daughter got kicked out on purpose so she could go to a house party.\nTousignant said the school called and gave her the option of picking the girl up from the office, but she chose not to because they lived only a block away. It's a decision she has come to live with.\n\"I blame myself sometimes,\" the girl's mother said. \"She would've snuck over there anyway.\"\nTousignant started searching the neighborhood when she realized her daughter was missing, and even went to the home where her body was later found.\nThe case went quiet until someone repairing an old deck came across the girl's body 17 months after her disappearance.\n\"She spent two of her birthdays underneath that porch,\" Tousignant said.\nFerreira was a teenager when Jopek died. He is now 50 years old, and it's not clear why he chose to call the TV station.\nHe appeared in court Saturday, Milwaukee police spokesman Tim Gauerke confirmed via email. Ferreira's attorney, Melissa Nepomiachi, didn't return a message from The Associated Press seeking comment Sunday.\nFerreira remains in custody in Milwaukee County Jail.\n\"I never put it out of my mind,\" said Tousignant. \"Every time I watch 'Cold Case'\" or some other detective show, I would hope and pray one of these days we get the person who did that to Carrie.\"\n\"I miss her,\" she added, \"so much.\"\nCopyright redistributed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:19:38.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
