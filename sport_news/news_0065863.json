However, Wales front-line regulars Dan Biggar, Scott Baldwin and Alun Wyn Jones were absent. \nIn-form Connacht made five changes from their win over Zebre with Carty, Darragh Leader, Shane Delahunt, Aly Muldowney and Eoghan Masterson all coming into the team. \nConnacht had much the best of the first half to lead 11-8 at the break - but Ospreys struck first blood with Davies kicking a penalty on three minutes. \nCarty missed a seventh minute penalty but after a fine break from scrum-half Kieran Marmion the fly-half was able to put over an easier attempt from in front of the posts. \nThe visitors lost captain and full-back Tiernan O'Halloran after hurting himself in a mid-air collision with Richard Fussell and two minutes later Ospreys were in front with a try for Baker created with a dart up the left by Walker and good link work from full-back Fussell. \nA combined attack from Marmion and Aki forced Josh Matavesi into a cynical piece of ball-killing by his posts which earned him a yellow card. It also allowed Carty to kick his second penalty. \nAnd, down to 14 men Ospreys, conceded a try when wing Healy went over on the left exploiting space from the blindside of a scrum courtesy of Marmion. \nDavies had a penalty chance to draw the points level at the break but his long-range effort fell short. \nThe second half saw a change of referee with Welshman Sean Brickell replacing Irishman Andrew Brace. \nAfter only four minutes of the restart Connacht stretched their lead to 10 points with a try for the lively Aki after good work by his co-centre Craig Ronaldson, who also converted. \nOspreys brought on Tipuric and James, making his first appearance for the region for three seasons, and the double change had an effect as Davies kicked a 49th minute penalty. \nBut Davies was not having his best day with the boot, missing a penalty in the 65th minute. \nHowever, with 11 minutes remaining Tipuric was over for the Ospreys' second try after good work by Davies, Scott Otten and Dan Evans - but Connacht still led 18-16 after Davies failed with the conversion, meaning the home fly-half had missed three penalties and two conversions - a total of 13 points. \nTwo minutes from time Ronaldson kicked a penalty to extend Connacht's advantage to five points and complete the scoring.
