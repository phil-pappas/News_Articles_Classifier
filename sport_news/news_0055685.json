Eastern Michigan is allowing 373.2 yards rushing per game, last among 127 FBS teams nationally .\nLSU coach Les Miles is never one to lay it on an opponent, so Fournette could be relaxing in the fourth quarter if his team takes care of business.\nHere's a schedule of the times of interest for the game and here are 5 things to know about the matchup .\nScroll down for a breakdown look at the game and both teams, position by position:\nWHEN: 6:02 p.m. CT Saturday\nWHERE: Tiger Stadium (102,321)\nRECORDS: LSU 3-0, 2-0 in SEC; Eastern Michigan, 1-3, 0-1 in MAC.\nRANKINGS: LSU is ranked No. 9 in the AP poll; No. 8 in the Amway coaches poll. Eastern Michigan is not ranked.\nCOACHES: LSU, Les Miles, 106-29/11 th season at LSU, 133-50 overall; Eastern Michigan, Chris Creighton, 3-13, 2 nd year at EMU; 142-59, 19 th season overall.\nTV: ESPNU\nREPLAY: SEC Network, Sunday, 11 p.m.; Monday, 11:30 a.m.; Thursday, 2 a.m. All times central.\nRADIO: WWL-870/105.3 (New Orleans), 98.1 (Baton Rouge), Sirius ch.134, XM ch. 201\nONLINE & TWITTER: NOLA.com/LSU, @JimKleinpeter, @RandyRosetta, @RonHigg, @JeritRoser, @JeffDuncan_\nLAST MEETING/SERIES RECORD: First meeting.\nINJURIES (as of Tuesday)\nLSU: S Jalen Mills (leg) doubtful; TE Dillon Gordon (Achilles) doubtful; DE Tashawn Bower (questionable); DE Isaiah Washington (arm) probable.\nEastern Michigan: DL Pat O'Connor (undisclosed) out; DB Brandon Bossard (undisclosed) out; DB Brady Hoying (undisclosed) out.\nWHO HAS THE EDGE?\nQUARTERBACK: LSU hasn't had to lean on Brandon Harris but it's clear he's getting better. He had four passes dropped last week but his best stat is zero interceptions in 47 passes thrown. Harris has a streak of 76 passes without a pick, going back to the Hail Mary throw on the final play of LSU's 2014 loss to Mississippi State. His QB rating is 129.72 and would be much higher with more use. He's improved his running instincts and his third-down instincts, throwing one ball away and scrambling for another last week. Brogan Roback has taken over for the Eagles since replacing Reginald Bell in the opener and has thrown for 877 yards and five TDs with four interceptions. He's been more productive but Harris is a much better runner and overall the better player. Advantage: Even\nRUNNING BACKS: Duh, Part 2. Leonard Fournette is facing the nation's worst rush defense and he will get his chances, but he will also get some rest in this game. The over/under is 12.5 carries. Younger backs like Derrius Guice and Nick Brossette need some work to get ready for the later-season grind and thus far only have 15 carries between them. David Ducre' also might get a tote or two. Darius Jackson brings balance to the Eagles with 407 yards and seven TDs on 59 carries, a 6.9 average. Shaq Vann backs him up with 240 yards and three touchdowns. Overall, Eastern Michigan runners have averaged 5.7 yards per carry. Advantage: LSU\nOFFENSIVE LINE: LSU had its streak of SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week awards broken at two but this unit continues to prosper. Fournette wasn't touched on his 62-yard scoring run and the 87-yarder called back was nearly a carbon copy. Will Clapp continues to play aggressively and is especially adept at dominating linebackers. The Tigers gave up two sacks, last week, one on a safety blitz and the other when Vadal Alexander was beaten. But they kept Harris clean in the second half and just look at all the rushing yardage. Eastern Michigan has stayed with the same five starters all season and it's a well-seasoned group. All five are fourth-year juniors. Four sacks allowed in four games isn't a bad track record. Advantage: LSU\nWIDE RECEIVERS/TIGHT ENDS : Brandon Harris has kept his part of the bargain and improved his play considerably in 2015. The LSU WRs, not so much. Four drops marred last week's offensive performance and were one more reason LSU could never finally put Syracuse away. Travin Dural also committed a costly penalty and the group as a whole could be more willing blockers. The Tigers will likely be without starting TE Dillon Gordon for the second week. The chances are good they will get come more targets, although Eastern Michigan is allowing only 127 yards per game through the air. Dustin Creel and Kris Strange have a combined 30 catches, which is more than all of LSU's wide receivers combined. Eddie Daughtery at 5-7 and 157 pounds is probably the smallest player LSU will see this season, but he's dangerous. He's averaging 19.6 yards per catch and his two TDs include a 64-yarder. TE Cody Tuttle with seven catches is an occasional target. Advantage: Eastern Michigan\nDEFENSIVE LINE: This area continues to not only excel but get deeper. Greg Gilmore had the Tigers' only sack and he and Frank Herron played more snaps than the week before. Starting DE Tashawn Bower might sit out even though Les Miles said he was available. That would allow a few more snaps for freshman DE Isaiah Washington, who has yet to play. Arden Key has held up well for a freshman and Lewis Neal plays with a hot-running motor that got him in trouble last week for pursuing a play without his helmet. The strength is in the middle where Christian LaCouture is an unsung hero and Davon Godchaux really pushes the pocket. Eastern Michigan's 3-4 defense is on the light side up front, which may account for the defense allowing 373.2 rushing yards per game, last in the nation. The Eagles have used four different starting combinations in four games and six different players. NT Kwanii Figueroa is the biggest at 282 pounds. This crew is in for a long night. Advantage: LSU\nLINEBACKERS: With Deion Jones back for a full game, all is right. Kendell Beckwith grows stronger and the depth isn't as bad as first thought. Lamar Louis and Duke Riley acquitted themselves well in his place, keeping Syracuse out of the end zone. Jones and Beckwith are 1-2 in tackles, the way it's supposed to be. For EMU, Great Ibe is the playmaker and leading tackler, with a forced fumble, PBU and half a sack. Derric Williams has four TFLs and two of those sacks. Advantage: LSU\nSECONDARY: LSU's strength will get stronger soon when S Jalen Mills returns but the young guys continue to play well. Tre'Davious White keeps people away with his cover skills and freshman Kevin Toliver has shown he won't back down. Syracuse went after him one play after an interference call and he continued his good coverage. LSU safeties are play-makers and hard-hitters. The Tigers have forced only three turnovers but more could happen this week. Donte Jackson has quitly improved and got the most snaps this season last week. The Eagles are undersized and the low passing yards allowed number (127) is more a function of teams being able to run on them, and playing triple-option Army last week. Opponents have completed 58.2% of their passes. Eagle DBs have only two of the teams eight passes broken up and no interceptions. Advantage: LSU\nSPECIAL TEAMS: LSU punter Jamie Keehn seems to get worse each week and it's a real puzzle as to why. He's kicking at home this week and that might help. Trent Domingue hit two more field goals and is solidly entrenched there but his kickoffs are falling shorter. He had no touchbacks on seven tries last week. The coverage teams struggled in the first half but rallied in the second. LSU is second-to-last in the SEC in kickoff returns and although Tre'Davious White brought a punt back for a score last week, he still struggles with his decisions to field the ball. Sophomore Austin Barnes is having a good year with a 47-yard punting average and Brendan Reinus has had only seven of his 25 kickoffs returned. The Eagles have only two punt returns all year. Opponents have had little success returning punts or kickoffs. Advantage: Eastern Michigan\nINTANGIBLES: \"Win one for the money\" might be the Eastern Michigan rallying cry. The Eagles get $985,000 for coming a long way to take it on the chin. LSU will likely be razor sharp after tripping over penalty flags all day at Syracuse. The crowd won't be magical like on Alabama nights and most will probably be gone by halftime to enjoy the rare fall weather in Baton Rouge's fall. Advantage: LSU\nPREDICTION\nComing off a poorly played road game is just poison for any team coming into Tiger Stadium. Eastern Michigan is trying to get going and taking this money game with an eye to the future. Les Miles will call off the dogs early and won't let Leonard Fournette get his hair mussed too badly before sending in the troops. We might even see some Anthony Jennings and likely a lot of freshmen who haven't yet played. But LSU needs to look sharp. Every game counts, especially with the one that wasn't played. That was a chance lost to impress the College Football Playoff committee, which almost certainly will have LSU in its sights when it begins to meet in earnest and talk about which teams are in the hunt. LSU has to take care of business and win impressively whenever it has the chance, and there's no better chance than Saturday.\nLSU 52, Eastern Michigan 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:47:29.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
