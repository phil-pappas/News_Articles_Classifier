Maryland's and Penn State's game captains face each other after a contentious pregame confrontation that culminated with the Terps' refusal to shake hands before the coin toss. (Abby Drey / MCT) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Carroll County Times Maryland & Penn State players appear to have put last year's (lack of a) handshake behind them. \nLast November, the aftermath of Maryland’s 20-19 victory over Penn State centered less on the Terps’ fourth-quarter comeback for only their second victory ever against the Nittany Lions and more on the happenings before kickoff. That was, of course, when captains Stefon Diggs, P.J. Gallo and Sean Davis refused to shake hands with Penn State’s captains, creating a stir in the college football world. \nThis year, it appears that things are going to go a little more cordially. \nWhen asked Tuesday if he planned to shake hands with Penn State players before Saturday’s game in Baltimore, right guard Andrew Zeller replied, “Absolutely.” \nPenn State players look to be keeping the same tact. \n“We’re just going to play it like a regular game,” Nittany Lions safety Marcus Allen said Tuesday when asked if Penn State had discussed last year’s game. “We've got to play with it to the best of our abilities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:44:26.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
