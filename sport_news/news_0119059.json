Rawat, Secretary General of ASSOCHAM while releasing the chamber's analysis.\n\"The QSR segment is expected to witness increased activity via market expansion and entry by various players,\" said Mr Rawat.\nAt the city level, a large share of the QSR market rests in metros and mini metros due to higher consumption, heightened consumer awareness, and exposure in key cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad.\nSlowly, QSRs have established their footholds in the major cities and are now expanding into smaller cities with smaller formats.\nThe fast food or QSR, format took off in India about 19 years ago with the arrival of McDonald's in 1996. Many global brands followed the suit since then, either through company-owned stores or the franchisee model, or a mix of both.\nThe chain space is marked by the presence of more than 120 brands with more than 4,000 outlets spread across various cities in India.\nTo withstand the competition, most of the players are tailoring their offerings in terms of flavours, pricing, services etc. to meet Indian consumers? inclinations.\nSome efforts reflecting this include the opening of pure vegetarian restaurants in certain parts of the country, offering no beef based products, establishing separate cooking areas for vegetarian and non vegetarian food, introducing local flavours in the menu, offering home delivery services etc.\nWith the entry of Indian and International brands into the space encouraging affordable eating and enabling the indulgence of even customers with smaller pockets.\nThe market is quite competitive in nature with players operating via core menu offerings and introducing variations in Indian and international foods.\nA noteworthy aspect is the focus of Indian players on multiple cuisines, which contrasts the international players? focusing on a single cuisine or product category.\nIn terms of menu, Indian QSRs like Haldiram's, Bikanervala etc. have a skew towards vegetarian food in contrast to which international players like McDonalds, Dominos, KFC, Subway etc. offer a mix of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian offerings. Even Mayonnaise in Indian McDonald outlets is free from eggs.\nBy 2020 it is expected that 35% of India's population will be in urban areas by 2020 totaling to 52 crores compared to the current urban population of 34 crores.\nWith a young population, a high rate of urbanization, rising disposable incomes, increased participation of women in the workforce, increased exposure to international cuisine and needs for elevated protein consumption, industry sources envision growth within the QSR sector.\nIndian consumers are increasingly spending large sums, eating out with family and friends on weekends and holidays, churning up a huge appetite for the QSR business.\nYoung and old Indians can be seen devouring billions of dollars worth of fast food at shopping malls, multiplex complexes, metro stations, and highway eateries and even in office blocks, as the eating out culture spreads across urban India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:17:11.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
