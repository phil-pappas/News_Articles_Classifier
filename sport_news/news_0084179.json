The Academy will be offering free SPOTme® skin cancer screenings with local board-certified dermatologists during the Cowboys Rally Day on Saturday, Oct. 10. Screening participants will be eligible to win autographed Cowboys memorabilia. Board-certified dermatologists will provide a visual inspection of exposed skin areas. SPOTme® skin cancer screenings will take place in a private booth on the sideline. An estimated 2,410 new cases of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, are expected to be diagnosed in Texas this year. Although skin cancer can affect anyone, men ages 50 and older have a higher risk of developing melanoma than the general population. Skin cancer is highly treatable when detected early, but it is still estimated that 9,940 people in the United States will die from melanoma this year. By encouraging fan participation in the free SPOTme® skin cancer screenings, the Academy and the Cowboys aim to save lives by educating the public about skin cancer prevention and detection. Visit SPOTme.org for additional information and valuable resources.
