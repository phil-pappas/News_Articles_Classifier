Key penalties and big plays led directly to points, and even though the No. 7 Panthers held the Redbirds to 241 total yards — including just 56 total yards the entire second half — being down 21-7 at the break was too much to overcome. \n“I’m pissed at the defense because we gave up penalties and touchdowns. That shouldn’t happen. That’s more on us than it is on them,” Farley said. “They played the wrong game in the first half. To me, the defense put them in a tough position. \n“Those are mental, physical errors when you confront somebody. We got moved at the line of scrimmage, and I’ll give them credit for that. They moved it with those tight splits. In the second half, it was a different story. But again, it doesn’t matter. The first half is part of the game, too. We dug ourselves a hole, thus we have to live with the outcome.” \nTo Farley’s point, UNI (2-2, 0-1 Missouri Valley Football Conference) had six penalties in the game for 83 yards. Five of those came in the first half, and three of those were personal fouls. \nTwo personal fouls were called on Edwin Young, who started in place of Makinton Dorleant — out for the first half of Saturday’s game after being ejected for fighting at Cal Poly. Young was called for a pass interference that extended a drive in the first quarter, then was called for a personal foul away from the ball after a third down play that would’ve sent either the punt or field goal unit for Illinois State. The Redbirds (3-1, 1-0) scored on a one-yard Marshaun Coprich touchdown two plays later. \nBut even after the Panthers cleaned up the penalties and big plays, the offense couldn’t find any kind of rhythm. \nStarting quarterback Aaron Bailey finished his game 7 of 17 for 108 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. He was relieved by Sawyer Kollmorgen, who went 5 of 14 for 38 yards and one interception. UNI only managed 104 total yards on the ground, with Tyvis Smith leading the way with 14 carries for 54 yards. \nThe biggest indictment on offense from Farley, though, came against the receiver group. They had at least six clear drops from a combination of Charles Brown, Marcus Weymiller, Rod Hall, Braden Lehman and Daurice Fountain. Brown and Weymiller each had drops in the end zone that could potentially have brought UNI to 21-17. \nThey were more than aware of what they didn’t do on Saturday, and the receivers know a long week awaits. \n“We really got a gut check at the receiver position,” Fountain said. “Coach nailed it on the head. They’re a good football team, but we shot ourselves in the foot a lot. We left a lot of big plays out on the field. \n“Aaron (Bailey) was getting pressured and scrambling a lot. But that’s not excuse. We should’ve been able to hit a couple big plays. We’ve got to get better.” \nFarley laid it out pretty simply. \nIf the Panthers execute on even a handful more plays in the second half alone, UNI potentially leaves a sold-out Hancock Stadium with a victory even after the poor first half. But there were no so-called momentum shifts to be had. \nAs in every game, this one was about making plays, and the Panthers didn’t. \n“Lack of execution. Weymiller had the one catch in the back of the end zone; that was a score. It was well-played and well thrown; should’ve been caught. Charles Brown in the other corner should’ve been caught,” Farley said. “It’s because of penalties is why we gave up the 21 points. If we catch the footballs that are thrown to us, that were catchable, then we’re probably ahead or it’s a different football game going down the stretch even though it’s still ours to take at the end. \n“We didn’t play very well and at the same time we’re in position to tie the game going down the stretch when we’re not even playing good football. It’s more on us than it is on them.” \nl Comments: (319) 368-8884; jeremiah.davis@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T18:45:08.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
