Wilson didn’t have the bulk to block effectively and didn’t have the strength to break tackles.\n\nWith the emergence of other playmakers and Braxton Miller’s switch to hybrid, it seemed like Wilson might get lost in the shuffle in 2015. It didn’t help that Wilson required two surgeries on the foot he broke in the Michigan State game last year (before making a crucial touchdown catch in that game).\n\nWilson was suspended for the 2015 season opener for violating team rules, but now he looks ready to re-emerge as the Buckeyes open Big Ten play against Indiana, Meyer said.\n\n“He’s really been working hard to get back to where he needs to be,” Meyer said on his radio call-in show on Thursday. “He’s never been a full-time player because he’s never been big or strong enough.”\n\nMeyer said that only now is Wilson capable of being an effective perimeter blocker. \n\n“The first year and a half he just couldn’t do it,” he said. “He wants to play and maybe someday play at the next level. There’s only one chance. You don’t see 175-pound receivers anymore. You need big, strong guys, especially all-purpose guys, or you’ll play five to 10 plays, and that’s not what he wants.”\n\nWilson’s 2015 stats are modest. He has only four catches for 34 yards. But the way Meyer talks about his development, he has the chance to make his mark, however belatedly.\n\nCelebration spoiled \n\nAdolphus Washington described his interception for a touchdown last week against Western Michigan as “definitely a dream,” but he had a grand finale planned that he didn’t get to execute.\n\nWashington said that he and fellow defensive linemen Joel Hale and Tyquan Lewis talked to strength coach Mickey Marotti on Saturday morning about a possible touchdown celebration if any of them scored.\n\n“We were saying what we would do if we got into the end zone,” Washington said. “I told him, ‘I’m going to get a penalty because I’m going to throw the ball in the stands.’”\n\nBut Washington was tripped as he crossed the goal line. When he got back up and raised his arms in celebration, defensive end Sam Hubbard inadvertently knocked the ball free while congratulating him.\n\n“When I got to the sideline, coach Mick said, ‘What happened to you throwing the ball into the crowd?’” Washington said.\n\nHe said it wasn’t his first touchdown. He scored as a tight end at Cincinnati Taft High School and also returned an interception for a score.\n\n@brdispatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:24:25.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
