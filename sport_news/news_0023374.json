Loup is away from the team dealing with a personal matter. The Blue jays have not disclosed the reason for his absence. \nWith lefty Brett Cecil out for the postseason after tearing his left calf in Game 2, Toronto doesn't have any left-handed pitchers available for the decisive game. \nManager John Gibbons says right-hander Marco Estrada could be available in relief of Marcus Stroman. Estrada started and won Game 3. \nRangers third baseman Adrian Beltre is in the lineup for Game 5, batting fourth. He left Game 1 with a strained back but returned with two hits in Game 4.
