They were arrested last week in Oregon.\nAn arraignment hearing for 24-year-old Sean Michael Angold, 23-year-old Morrison Haze Lampley and 18-year-old Lila Scott Alligood has been set for Wednesday, authorities said. It's unclear if they have retained lawyers.\nMarin County District Attorney Ed Berberian said each suspect is charged with two counts of murder with special circumstances, including lying in wait — charges that could lead to the death penalty.\nThe body of Audrey Carey, 23, was discovered in Golden Gate Park the morning of Oct. 3. She was shot once in the head, police said.\nInvestigators believe Carey was camping in the park, which was hosting a free, three-day bluegrass festival.\nTantric yoga instructor Steve Carter, 67, was found dead two days later along a popular hiking trail in Marin County, 20 miles north of San Francisco. He was still clutching the leash of his dog, the Marin County Sheriff's Office said. The dog also was shot but is expected to survive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:18:28.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
