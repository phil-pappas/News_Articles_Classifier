Comment Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 11:13 PM Cheboygan, Mich. sports@cheboygantribune.com CHEBOYGAN — A few steps forward … then several steps back. For the Cheboygan Chiefs, now 1-4, that’s been somewhat of the theme throughout their three-game losing streak, including a recent 38-7 homecoming loss to Alpena. On offense, it’s usually been a silly turnover or bad penalty that’s halted potential point-scoring drives, while big plays by the opposing team’s offense has haunted the Cheboygan defense. When you put it all together, one word comes to mind — frustrating. “I mean I think everybody gets frustrated when we feel like we’re in good positions, we have kids accomplishing good blocks, executing good runs, but we just don’t finish drives because we might end up having a penalty,” said Cheboygan head coach Dave Schulz, whose team will head to Sault Ste. Marie for a 7 p.m. contest on Friday night. “It’s just a matter of putting it all together. It takes good practices along with good focus and execution in the game.” Offensively, it’s been nothing short of a nightmare for the Chiefs, who have only combined to score 21 points during their last three games against Kingsford, Petoskey and Alpena. Perhaps the most frustrating of the three defeats came last Friday, when the Chiefs squandered several opportunities to score against the Wildcats. Despite a solid drive to get themselves back in the game in the second quarter, the Chiefs came up empty in their other attempts to score touchdowns. The games will not get any easier for the Chiefs, who will battle a Sault Ste. Marie (4-2) team hungry for a state playoff berth. The Blue Devils will have plenty of confidence coming into their homecoming contest following a 37-27 victory over Gladstone last week. Like some of the teams the Chiefs have already faced, Schulz said the Blue Devils are impressive on both sides of the ball. “We’ve seen a variety of different offenses and defenses, so we feel like we’ve played games that have prepared us to play in a game like this against the Sault,” Schulz said. “They’ve got good team speed where they can attack out, hit you inside, too, because they have good power, and their backs are good. “Defensively, it’s a big challenge to keep all that contained and make good tackles on those kids who do have speed. When it comes to the Blue Devils on offense, Nicholas LaCross leads the way as the team’s starting quarterback, while Justin Fountain might be the team’s biggest threat at tailback. In last week’s victory over the Braves, Fountain rushed for 136 yards. Ryan Jones, another tailback, is another Blue Devils player to watch for on Friday. Page 2 of 2 - With multiple playmakers, the Blue Devils’ offense will be a massive challenge for a struggling Cheboygan defense. “I think the quarterback (LaCross) is a great leader,” Schulz added. “He gets the team going not only throwing the ball but making some big plays with his legs, and everybody else kinda follows through.” As far as the Chiefs are concerned, they’ll be hoping to improve upon what was a decent rushing performance against the Wildcats last week. Leading the Chiefs was senior tailback Austin Sidelinker, who used shiftiness and tough running to nearly rush for 100 yards in the game. For the Chiefs on offense, it’ll simply come down to not shooting themselves in the foot during drives. “We’ve got to try to attack and take advantage as best as we can and do it consistently,” Schulz said. “No turnovers, no penalties, especially ones at crucial times, and if we do that, that allows us to be consistent. It’s like when you have turnovers and negative plays, that’s what causes you to be inconsistent. It’s not like the kids don’t try on the next play, it’s the offsides, it’s the penalty or something like that, and that’s what creates the inconsistency, the breakdown in pass protection, if somebody runs the wrong route. It’s those types of things, not executing the big play when you can make a catch.” Playing the role of spoiler could also be on the minds of the Chiefs, who handled the Blue Devils during a 45-13 thrashing at Western Avenue Field last season. For Schulz, playing a solid game — and possibly ruining the Blue Devils’ postseason hopes — would be quite satisfying. “We just want to go out and play our best football,” Schulz said. “If our best football wins the football game, then great. We’re not gonna make this an easy road for them (Sault). We’re going to go play to win a football game, and that’s what we do every week.” WCBY Radio will carry the Cheboygan-Sault Ste.
