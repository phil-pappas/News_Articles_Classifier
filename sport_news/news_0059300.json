That set up a second-round meeting with Republic of Congo. \nKenya had won its first-leg match 5-2 against Mauritius last week, meaning a 0-0 draw Sunday was more than enough to take the Kenyans through. They will play Cape Verde in the second round next month. \nTanzania held on for a 2-1 aggregate win over Malawi and now faces top-ranked African team Algeria. \nThe three were the first of 13 lower-ranked teams who will make it to Africa's second round. The other 10 first-round matchups will be settled Tuesday. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:49:12.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
