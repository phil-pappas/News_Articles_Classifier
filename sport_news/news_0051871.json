Defensive coordinator Joseph Carter called McCutcheon the “joker” of the defense, but his play has been no laughing matter. \n“He understands the concepts and what we’re trying to do on defense. I can move him all over, he’s a guy I call a joker,” Carter said. “To me, he’s my brain out there. Some other guys at other positions don’t do those other things quite as well, but we require them to do it. But he’s my catch-all guy. At times at he’s going play like a linebacker, he’s going to play like a safety and he’s going to play like a corner.” \nMcCutcheon and the rest of the Tuskegee defense are all business this week as they prepare for the 80 th annual Tuskegee-Morehouse Classic in Columbus, Georgia. But still, they have some fun. \nMcCutcheon, free safety Michael Robinson and linebacker Jewell Ratliff make a game out of who will get the most interceptions. The young gun currently has the leader over his senior counterparts. McCutcheon leads the team with interceptions, while Ratliff has two and Robinson has one. \n“It’s a little bit of competition. We just battle it out each week,” McCutcheon said. “What you going to do this week? Who’s going to get it this week? That’s how we roll out.” \nRatliff led the team with three interceptions last year. Even though McCutcheon is currently setting the pace, Ratliff said it’s a win-win. \n“He’s got the lead. I mean, we’re not mad at him. We’re rooting for him,” Ratliff said. “When you have those type of ball skills, I don’t mind him having the lead in the competition. We’re always competitive throughout the week, even on Sunday we talk about what we’re going to do on Monday.” \nMcCutcheon is coming off of a season-high four tackles last week against UNC Pembroke. Once a question mark in the secondary, coach Willie Slater said McCutcheon has been a big addition to the defense. \n“He’s coming along. I see what coach Carter saw in him. He has been a pleasant surprise for us,” Slater said. “He has a couple of interceptions in the book. That’s a couple more than we had in that position last year. Plus he makes some tackles. He’s been a good addition. And he’s young, so we’re going to have him around a while…It’s good to have a guy like that.” 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RyIwnZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:15:49.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
