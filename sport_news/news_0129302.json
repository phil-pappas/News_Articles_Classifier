Norwalk to 5-1 for the season.\nThe Warriors were able to take an early lead they would not relinquish with a 35-yard touchdown pass from Brady Brandsfield to Justin South in the first quarter. Brandsfield then hit Sonny Onken with a 22-yard strike in the second quarter to take a 14-0 lead at half.\nChariton came out inspired and got on the scoreboard on a 57-yard touchdown run early in the third to make it 14-7. Norwalk was able to extend its lead later in the third quarter on a 2-yard run by Coby Klocko and a 1-yard run by Brandsfield to make it 27-14.\nChariton was able to climb back within a score with back-to-back touchdown passes to close the gap to 21-7. But, Norwalk shut the door later in the fourth quarter on Klockoâ€™s second 2-yard TD run of the night to clinch their fifth victory of the year.\nAs has been the case most of the season, it was a heavy dose of Brandsfield that paved the way to the triumph. He was 17-27 for 188 yards through the air. He also added 95 yards rushing on 10 carries. Klocko also had a big night on the ground, rushing for 106 yards on 19 attempts.\nDefensively, the Warriors were a very opportunistic bunch, forcing four Chariton turnovers. Will Fraser picked-off his fourth interception of the season. Tanner Downs, Dylan Polka, and Sonny Onken all pounced on Chariton fumbles as well. Chris Bowles led Norwalk in tackles with 11 followed by Logan Foetisch with nine.\nNorwalk will begin the final third of the season on the road Friday at Oskaloosa.\nRead //dmreg.co/1RqVzaT", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//dmreg.co/1RqVzaT&mini=true", "http://dmreg.co/1RqVzaT", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/05/IAGroup/DesMoines/635796432578676696-norwalk.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//dmreg.co/1RqVzaT&text=Norwalk%20moves%20on%20toward%20playoffs%20with%2031-24%20win%20at%20home&via=DMRegister", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a2b8df6a94dd5e9040206aca654f0c3c656f74a8/r=500x291/local/-/media/2015/10/05/IAGroup/DesMoines/635796432578676696-norwalk.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aeba34342af62f053ba746b2e9d433280a12db28/c=161-0-1278-840&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/05/IAGroup/DesMoines/635796432578676696-norwalk.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:30:32.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
