Now, so does the rest of the country. Garwood, a senior at HLGU, was named NAIA National Women's Cross Country Runner of the Week on Sept. 30, the first time the standout has achieved the honor. Garwood became eligible for the award after being named American Midwest Conference Runner of the Week for the second time this season. Her selection made her eligible for the national award, chosen from a pool of more than 30 female runners. “I was kind of surprised because I had never won the award before,” Garwood said. “It feels pretty good. To me, it feels like my hard work is paying off.” Garwood's honor came after a strong performance at the Rhodes College Cross Country Invitational in Memphis, Tenn., on Sept. 29. She set a personal-record time of 21:17.44 in the 6-kilometer race that featured 180 runners. Garwood finished second, but did so only after pushing Martina Rodriguez of Division I Memphis to the limit. Rodriguez finished in 21:15.85. Garwood's time was an improvement by more than a minute and a half from her 2014 fifth-place performance at the same race. Her outing left Lemons gushing with compliments. “She's as good as anybody, she really is,” the coach said. “She's one of the bets in the country, and it's not even close. “She'll be the greatest athlete to walk out of Hannibal-LaGrange when it's all said and done.” Lemons high praise for Garwood comes a year after the young runner was named a 2014 NAIA All-American in both cross country and indoor and outdoor track and field. Garwood said the national recognition is nice, and that being named national runner of the week is a special honor, but said it means little in regard to the big picture. “I think maybe it's just motivation to just keep trying to get after it and do the best I can,” she said. “Whether I got this recognition or not, it's not going to affect how I run. I'm just going to keep staying focused and improving over the next two months to get ready for nationals.” The NAIA Championships take place on Nov. 21 in Charlotte, N.C., and Lemons is convinced Garwood has a shot to win it all. “She's definitely going to be right there with everybody else,” he said. “She's had some fine races this season, but the Rhodes invite really showed a lot of people what she's capable of, and I think she's only going to get better heading into the national competition.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:56:15.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
