While facing the No. 2 team in the state in Class 2 as of October 16th, the Pirates gave Southern Boone everything they could handle and more before falling by a score of 1-0. Southern Boone, 23-1-1 on the season, will face Fatima in the sectional round of the state playoffs on Tuesday, Oct. 27th in Ashland starting at 6 p.m. The Comets beat Sullivan 1-0 on a penalty kick in the championship in the Class 2 District 10 Tournament Thursday night in St. Clair. The winner of the SBC-Fatima game will advance to the quarterfinals on Saturday, Oct. 31st. While the loss closed out Boonville’s season at 13-6-1 overall, head coach Tim Brown said this was the third straight year that Boonville has met SBC in the district final and each year the Eagles have been one of the top-three ranked teams in the state. “We put up a good fight, but man-for-man, they are a much more skilled team than we are,” Brown said. In the only score of the game, SBC finally broke through Boonville’s line of defense at the 13-minute mark in the first half when Zach Culley hit a straight on shot from 30 yards out to make it 1-0. From there the Eagles controlled the ball while stopping only a handful of shots by Boonville. Meanwhile, in the second half, the Pirates came out with a few scoring opportunities early on corner kicks but were denied by a more senior dominated SBC team. Then, with less than 10 minutes left in the match, the Eagles again made a charge in front of Boonville’s net. However after several attempts to score, the Pirates thwarted SBC with great play at the goalie position by junior Riley Lang and the two center backs. SBC finished the game with 24 shot attempts and 10 shots on goal while Boonville had 12 shot attempts and only four shots on goal. As for saves in the match, Lang turned back nine shots by the Eagles but was busy all night in his box. For the season, junior Alec Adair led the Pirates with 38 goals and tied for the team-high with Philip Udinyiwe with 17 assists. Adair also had six game-winning goals and scored a total of 93 points based on a point system by Coach Brown. Philip Udinyiwe had 26 goals, 17 assists and four game-winning goals for a total of 69 points, followed by Luke Rehagen with six goals and six assists for a total of 18 points, Cristian Vivas with three goals and nine assists for a total of 15 points, Brady Gholson with one goal, 11 assists and one game-winning goal for a total of 13 points, Brian Brown with three goals and four assists for a total of 10 points, Gio Strickland with two goals, four assists and one game-winning goal for a total of eight points, Skyler Blumhorst with one goal and two assists for a total of four points, Trent Monk with one goal for a total of two points, Joshua Udinyiwe with one goal for a total of two points, Riley Lang with one assist for a total of one point and Matt Shafer with one assist for a total of one point.
