Years ago, that earned the company a spot on the Standard & Poor's Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that annually increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.\nStrong sales overseas help Abbott push quarterly profits up 7.6 percent John Russell Abbott Laboratories, maker of heart stents and diagnostic equipment, said Wednesday that strong sales of generic drugs in emerging markets overseas led the way to a robust third-quarter performance, and it was on track to achieve its full-year earnings projections.\nBy the numbers: The North Chicago-based...\nAbbott Laboratories, maker of heart stents and diagnostic equipment, said Wednesday that strong sales of generic drugs in emerging markets overseas led the way to a robust third-quarter performance, and it was on track to achieve its full-year earnings projections.\nBy the numbers: The North Chicago-based...\n(John Russell) \"Dividends are an important part of Abbott's heritage and investment identity, as many of our investors are looking for a combination of growth and income,\" Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel said.\nAbbott shares the Dividend Aristocrats index with 53 other companies, including several others from Illinois, such as McDonald's, Walgreens Boots Alliance, McDonald's Corp. and Illinois Tool Works Inc.\nSome can boast they've been around nearly as long as Abbott. Walgreens, for example, has paid a regularly quarterly dividend for 83 years (36 cents a share last quarter). Others are relative newcomers; McDonald's has done so for 39 years (85 cents a share last quarter).\nSo who loves dividend stocks the most? Think of a retired person, or someone nearing retirement, who doesn't want to take a lot of chances with their life savings, said James Early, an income-investment adviser at Motley Fool, a financial-services company in Alexandria, Va.\n\"These people want to sleep at night,\" Early said. \"They want something safe. They want reliable yields. They want a proven business model. And companies on the Dividend Aristocrats Index have paid dividends faithfully, year in and year out.\"\njrussell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @johnrussell99\n Walgreens Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562aae3f/turbine/ct-abbott-dividends-streak-1023-biz-20151023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627a8cf/turbine/ct-abbott-earnings-1022-biz-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:22:46.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
