By CantonRep.com staff report Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 10:21 AM Updated at 10:26 AM Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 10:21 AM Updated at 10:26 AM • Former Perry teacher, swimming coach charged with having sex with student... The national governing body that oversees competitive swimming in the United States has banned former Perry High School and club coach Eric Spaulding from coaching for life after his July arrest on sexual assault charges. USA Swimming has placed Spaulding on its permanently suspended list as his court case continues to make its way through the legal system. A pretrial hearing was set for today in Stark County Common Pleas Court in Canton. No action was taken and another pretrial date was set for Nov. 2 before Judge Taryn Heath. Spaulding is charged with sexual battery, accused of having a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old student. Ohio law makes it a crime for a teacher, administrator, coach or other person in authority employed by or serving in a school to have sex with a student in the same school even when they reach 18 years old. Sexual battery is a third-degree felony that can bring a prison term of up to five years with a conviction. The Perry Police Department opened an investigation on April 14 after the alleged sexual encounters were reported to the school’s resource officer. USA Swimming banned Spaulding, who has since resigned his teaching position at Perry, for violating two of the organization’s code of conduct rules for having “pending charges for a felony ... (and) any crime involving sexual misconduct.” The second violation was for conduct detrimental to the sport.
