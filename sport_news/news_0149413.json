He’s a quality player and he’s shown that for the Rebels. \n“And at training he’s just been terrific, really ripping in every training. He’s ready to go if he’s needed.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:01:38.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
