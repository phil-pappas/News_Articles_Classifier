Rutgers figures to be a heavy underdog in all three of those games.\nA Nov. 14 home date versus Nebraska (2-4) looks more winnable than it did before the season, although the Cornerhuskers — who have lost all four of their games on the opponent's final offensive play — may be the best four-loss team in the country.\nA loss to Indiana this week and Rutgers faces the likelihood of being eliminated from bowl contention before it even hosts Nebraska in mid-November. Defeat Indiana and the final three-game stretch — home versus Nebraska, at Army (1-5) and home versus Maryland (2-4) — will have meaning regardless of how ugly Ohio State, Wisconsin and Michigan turn out to be.\nHere are five stories from Sunday to get you up to speed on the latest Rutgers football news:\nRutgers AD Julie Hermann on Norries Wilson: 'Truly we're lucky he was here to step in' Blame Kyle Flood for Rutgers' fourth-down spike snafu | Politi 10 takeaways from Rutgers' loss to Michigan State Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio: Don't be 'too hard' on Rutgers quarterback Chris Laviano What happened to Rutgers running back Paul James after his 72-yard run?
