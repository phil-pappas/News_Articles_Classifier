What makes two over-easy eggs so special? The ingredients speak for themselves. The runny yolks come on a bed of spicy pork chorizo-jalapeno-red pepper hash (yes, this is real, and it's spectacular) laden with melted cheddar cheese and artsy drizzles of ancho ketchup and sour cream. That would be enough to sell us, but add a generous dollop of guacamole, and this plate takes a turn for the legendary. Especially when loaded onto a thick slice of buttery multigrain or sourdough toast, the Sassy Eggs earn their title. 4943 N.
