On a come back after an Achilles injury had forced her off the circuit for a while, the former world number four showed she had not lost much in her sharpness.\nThe accurate returns with early pick ups kept Joshana away to the back. Though the Indian fought back with her prowess up front, to grab the second game, Joelle never showed any signs of tiredness or weakness on her legs as she went about business-like giving little leeway to finish off the match 3-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:30:47.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
