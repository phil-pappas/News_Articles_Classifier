Forward Jack Downing had a pair of goals, while forwards Christiaan Minella, Joe Wilson, and Nick Huard each chipped in one for the Cyclones, who win their fourth straight season opener, and second season opener in a row against Toledo. \nThe Cyclones wasted little time getting on the board, as just 1:02 into the opening period, forward Andrew Yogan skated around the Walleye net on a wrap around attempt, and slid the puck to Downing who tipped it past Walleye goaltender Jake Patterson, giving the Cyclones a 1-0 lead. \nThat lead held up throughout the remainder of a very physical first period, and in the second, Cincinnati pushed that lead to 2-0, when defenseman Riley Weselowski sent a pass to Minella who skated in on Patterson and fired a wrister past him, 5:49 into the second. \nThe third period saw more offense from the Cyclones, as midway through the frame, Yogan fanned on a shot attempt but the puck went right to Wilson who launched it past Patterson, extending the Cyclones' lead to 3-0. The goal marked the first of Wilson's professional hockey career. \nAfter a power play goal from Walleye forward Alden Hirschfeld cut Cincinnati's lead to 3-1, Downing potted an empty netter for his second tally of the night, putting the Cyclones back up by three, 4-1, with under three minutes left in the game. \nCincinnati capped off the big night with just 15.5 seconds remaining in the frame, when Huard skated in on a 2-on-1 rush and fired a shot past Patterson, sealing the 5-1 win. \nCincinnati outshot Toledo, 31-26 on the night, while the powerplay was held scoreless on all five of its chances. Cyclones netminder Brad Thiessen was stellar in net, stopping 25 of the 26 shots he faced in the win. \nCincinnati wraps up their brief two-game, season-opening home stand next Saturday night against the Kalamazoo Wings. Faceoff is scheduled for 7:30pm. \nInformation provided by the Cincinnati Cyclones Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:51:59.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
