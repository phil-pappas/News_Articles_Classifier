Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series Tuesday afternoon. He faces Kansas City’s lanky right-hander Chris Young in Game 4.\nToronto’s Ryan Goins hits a home run in the fifth inning to help the Blue Jays beat the Kansas City Royals, 11-8, in Game 3 of their American League Championship Series Monday in Toronto. It was Toronto’s first win in the series. (AP)\nDespite being outhit 15-11 by the pesky Royals, Toronto pounced on Kansas City’s pitching in the first ALCS game in Toronto since 1993 for their most runs ever at home in the postseason – after scoring just three in two games in Kansas City.\nThe Blue Jays needed them, too. Kansas City scored four times off starter Marcus Stroman and then added four in the ninth, capped by Kendrys Morales’ two-run homer off Osuna.\nSeemingly not distracted by the contentious federal elections that were being held in Canada on Monday, 49,751 fans serenaded Kansas City pitcher Johnny Cueto with a sing-song “Cueto-Cueto!” chant from the game’s first pitch and never quieted down.\nThe Royals took a quick lead when Alcides Escobar led off the game with a sinking liner that went under right fielder Jose Bautista’s glove for a triple off Stroman. Ben Zobrist drove in Escobar with a grounder, but that was the only advantage Kanas City would hold in having its nine-game ALCS winning streak snapped. The string dated to the 1985 series against Toronto.\nBlue Jays center fielder Kevin Pillar quashed that rally with a fantastic, over-the-shoulder catch that sent him crashing into the wall.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:57:55.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
