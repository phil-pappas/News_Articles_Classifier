Teeter was slated to appear at the PA PREPS All-State Camp back in March but suffered an injury that prevented him from attending the event. Teeter attended several prospect camps over the summer that included a stop at Ohio State. It was at the Ohio State prospect camp that Teeter recorded a 40-yard dash time in the 4.4 range. Teeter has had a productive season so far through five games. Teeter has caught a total of 17 passes for 377 yards (22.2 yards per catch) and four touchdowns. From a recruiting standpoint, Teeter does not have an offer at this time. Teeter is a little bit under the radar from a recruitment standpoint, but with his height, pass-catching ability and speed to separate from defenders down the field, he should start to get more notice. Check out his highlights from his first four games:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:10:22.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
