And I can't emphasize how proud I am of him.\" \nClarke Central jumped out to a 10-0 lead only to watch Winder running back Cece Green find enough running room to make it 10-7 just before the half. After a scoreless third quarter Winder faced yet another late battle -- and the Bulldoggs (5-3, 5-2 Region 8- ) answered the bell. \n\"I feel good about the way the guys are playing and their resiliency,\" said Webb, whose team will take on region leader Lanier next week. \"We take every week as something new. The past has no bearing on what's going to happen Friday night. That's how we approach it.\" \nIt's working. Winder is on a four-game win streak -- all of which have been decided by a total of 17 points. Their refusal to yield has the Bulldoggs alone in fourth place in the Region 8- standings.
