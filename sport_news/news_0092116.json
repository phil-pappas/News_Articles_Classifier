Pierre-Paul remains unsigned, and the Giants and his reps likely will have to negotiate a compromise on the price for his one-year deal. A contract must be signed by Nov. 17, or Pierre-Paul would be declared out for the season.\nBeckham doesn’t practice \nWR Odell Beckham Jr. (hamstring) didn’t practice Wednesday, but the Giants likely will monitor his participation the way they did last week to make sure he’s ready to go Sunday. … LB Devon Kennard (hamstring) returned to practice as a limited participant. He said he expects to play against the Cowboys on Sunday after missing two games. \"Two weeks felt like two months,\" he said. … The Giants signed CB Leon McFadden from the Arizona practice squad to fill the roster spot created by S Cooper Taylor’s release Tuesday. CBs Trumaine McBride (groin) and Trevin Wade (concussion) did not practice. \n— Art Stapleton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:01:02.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
