Casady-Morales, who was a member of the 1997 Bearcat women's tennis team which was inducted into the Northwest Missouri State Hall of Fame Class in 2011, will be part of the 1996 team that will be honored this weekend in Maryville. \nCasady-Morales played tennis for four years at Northwest Missouri State, playing mainly the fourth position in singles and was on the school’s No. 2 doubles team. The 1994 Ottumwa Female Athlete of the Year still ranks seventh all-time at the college for most doubles victories in a career with 70. \nCasady-Morales was part of some of the best teams in Northwest Missouri State women's tennis history, including the 1997 squad finished 28-2 and beat three Division I programs and captured the program’s sixth MIAA title. The team had an unprecedented 24-match win streak, and featured five MIAA individual champions and the program’s first national quarterfinal appearance. \nCassidy-Morales won both singles and doubles MIAA titles during the 1996 season. As a team, Northwest Missouri State went 20-5 and won its fourth MIAA team championship in five years. \n“Being inducted into Northwest Missouri State’s Hall of Fame is a great honor,” said Casady-Morales. “I owe all my successes with tennis to my parents, (Ottumwa) Coach (Dan) Staggs, and Coach (Mark) Rosewell (at Northwest Missouri State).\" \nActivities this weekend for the M Club Hall of Fame will include a tennis social taking place on Friday at 9:30 p.m. On Saturday, there will be activities including an alumni tennis match starting at 9:30 a.m. The induction of the team will take place during halftime of the Northwest Missouri State football game, which kicks off at 2 p.m. \nFor more information, please contact head coach Mark Rosewell at 660-562-1312.
