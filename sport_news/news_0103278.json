Congress has done graduation in corruption, now they are doctorate. Lokpal bill is the solution for corruption,\" Hazare said addressing to the media here.\nHazare also voiced the removal of poll symbols from ballot papers and Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).\n\"Use of election symbols (on ballot papers and EVMs) is against the Constitution of India. It is nowhere written in the Constitution that there should be election symbols and they should be removed. For this we don't have to speak to the government but to the Election Commission,\" he added.\nAnna Hazare had earlier received an anonymous threat letter in Sikar where he is scheduled to hold a rally on Sunday, after which security was beefed up at the place where he is staying.\nSecurity enhanced outside the place where Anna Hazare is staying in Sikar (Rajasthan)after an anonymous threat letter pic.twitter.com/4g6URg0bFg\nâ€” ANI (@ANI_news) October 11, 2015 Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/653040154580418560", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://t.co/4g6URg0bFg"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:06:10.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
