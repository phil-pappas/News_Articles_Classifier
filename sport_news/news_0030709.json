Three big hits. It’s great to see him get to the second level.”\nWilson said he thought the defense stopped Elliott well, until it came to the three long runs.\n“The rest of the day he has 72 yards,” Wilson said, subtracting the yardage of Elliott’s three longest runs. “There were less than 173 plays. To me, the difference in the game is they turned it over a couple of times and gave us a chance, but they made three big plays, and we didn’t really make one.”\nJones, who led the Buckeyes to a National Championship victory last season, threw for just 245 pass yards and also threw one interception to sophomore linebacker Tegray Scales in IU territory.\nBarrett never touched the ball, and Miller ran the ball twice, once for minus-nine yards and once for 14 yards. Both players are athletes who have been in the Heisman trophy conversation.\nThe Hoosiers also forced three Buckeye turnovers while not surrendering any.\n“(The turnovers) were big,” Scales said. “Our team was able to capitalize on them. We just have to play one play at a time, and then just see what happens. Tonight, we just came up on the short side. We need to continue to build.”\nWhile the Hoosiers hung in the game with the defending champions, a team that has won 18 games in a row, and did not allow the point-differential to exceed 14, Wilson said that he was proud of the team and the way it held Ohio State down.\nMeyer said that he thinks IU will be going to a Bowl game this season.\n“They beat Missouri las year,” Meyer said. “They’ve got Division I scholarship athletes, too, and that’s a team that will be going to a Bowl game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:04:08.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
