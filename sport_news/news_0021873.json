Their motion has been sealed from public view, and neither side would describe the evidence. \nJudge Jeffrey Locke is expected to hear arguments during a hearing Tuesday. \nHernandez is accused of following the men, then opening fire as they sat in their car at a stop light. He has pleaded not guilty. \nHernandez was convicted in a separate murder earlier this year and is serving a life sentence. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:08:10.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
