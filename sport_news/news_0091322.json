Early in the game, Cartersville's Tiamon Pennymon finds, or more like slides into the end zone to give the Hurricanes a 7-0 lead.Flash forward, Pennymon again finds an opening and just walks right into the end zone, 14-0 Hurricanes.Looking to score again, Lawrence throws a long pass down the middle of the field, but it's going to be intercepted by the Generals #21 Austin Ferguson.Heritage now with a chance.Unfortunately, all hopes would be lost when Quarterback Corbee Wilson would be sacked for a loss by the Hurricanes Darrien Poellintz.Second quarter, Hurricanes with ball, and Lawrence is going to keep the ball and navigate his way through the traffic and dive right into the end zone for the touchdown.Cartersville still rolling, Lawrence back to work; fakes a hand off to Dominique Williams, and will find his way to the end zone again.Hurricanes now leading 42-0 going into halftime.Final score Cartersville rolling all over Heritage 42-6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:55:38.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
