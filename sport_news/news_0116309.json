Martinez then fired home in the 29th and Torres added another in the 63rd to put the game out of reach at the Vicente Calderon Stadium in Madrid. \nThe fourth goal came when Astana defender Denys Dedechko turned the ball into his own net while trying to clear a low cross in the 89th. \nThe victory leaves Atletico with six points from three matches in Group C. Benfica, which lost 2-1 at Galatasaray, also has six points but trails the Spanish club on goal difference. Galatasaray reached four points, while winless Astana remains in last place with only one point. \nAtletico will travel to Kazakhstan to play Astana in the next round, while Benfica hosts Galatasaray in Portugal. \nAtletico, the Champions League runner-up two seasons ago, had a slow start but was in control throughout the match. \nNiguez found the net with a remarkable back-heel touch after Yannick Carrasco picked up a pass from a short corner and drove into the area before firing a low pass to Niguez in front of the goal. \nMartinez's shot deflected off a defender before going in for Atletico's second goal, and Torres came off the bench to seal the victory with a chip shot over Astana goalkeeper Nenad Eric after a run through the right side of the penalty area. \nMartinez had one of his best performances since joining Atletico this season, and his second goal since arriving at the Spanish club came as a relief following a long scoring drought. In addition to having a goal disallowed in the 27th, the Colombian also came close to scoring with a close-range header brilliantly saved by Eric in the 40th. \nFollow Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:52:09.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
