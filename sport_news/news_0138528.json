Alabama will kick off against Arkansas at 6:00 p.m. at Bryant-Denny Stadium.\nEli Gold hosted and USA Today college football writer George Schroeder was the media guest. Take a look below for a full recap of the show:\nSEGMENT 4\n--Saban finishes his show by saying people think he doesn't like the media, but he says that's not the case. He says he appreciates quality journalism.\n--Saban says team has to win at line of scrimmage to win against the Razorbacks.\n--Saban wraps up his radio show asking fans to recreate support and enthusiasm that fans showed last week in Georgia win. Says it really helps maintain focus and intensity and will be needed this Saturday against Arkansas. Said fans kept team in the game against Ole Miss.\nSaban discussing the pop pass. Says it makes it difficult for defense, but that it comes down to fundamental execution. He's reiterated that point for weeks.\nSEGMENT 3\n--Schroeder asks about nine-game SEC schedule. Saban thinks every player should get to play every SEC team during his career. He brings up how Alabama has already played three top 20 teams in five games: \"How many other teams have done that?\"\n--Saban said it wasn't his idea to think off WWE belt for defensive turnover winners, but that he likes it.\n--Saban talks about Grandma Saban cooking for him all the time. Talks about an old lady asking him if defense was going to play bump-and-run, man-to-man defense or if it would be more soft coverage.\n--Saban says pass protection is like fractions. In every fraction, everyone has to identify who the OL will block.\n--Schroeder asks when recruiting quarterbacks, what's the thing Saban looks for the most. Saban says most important things are judgment, accuracy and leadership. Says it's so much about decisions they make and that football intuition is imperative. Says it's very hard to judge if a guy has \"it\" when going through the recruiting process.\nSEGMENT 2\n--AL.com reader asks about whether Saban will go back to having coaches in the booth. He says it's completely up to the coach and where he wants to be. Said Kiffin had typically been in the booth as a coordinator, but Saban wanted him on the sidelines to help Blake Sims. Saban said he used to prefer being up in the booth but Bill Belichick made him do it from the sidelines when they worked together with the Cleveland Browns. Saban thinks it made him a better coach.\n--Saban talks about all of the great coaches and mentors he's had over the years, mentioning people like Don James and Bill Belichick. Says he's been very fortunate.\n--Saban said defensively Arkansas is the same as last year. Saban says offensively Arkansas does a lot of the same running skills, but have a different offensive coordinator (Dan Enos) and that they've opened it up more in the passing game.\n--Saban said Alabama knew Calvin Ridley could be special. Said he's a mature young man for a freshman and that's helped him make an early impact.\n--Schroeder asks about Jake Coker evolving. Saban says he's gotten more confident and comfortable with his teammates. The thing Coker did a great job of was going 7 of 8 early in the game, the Alabama head coach said.\nSaban said center Ryan Kelly did the best against Georgia out of the offensive linemen. Also complimented left tackle Cam Robinson.\nSEGMENT 1\n--Saban says roughing the center is a good rule, but on Saturday didn't think his team roughed the center. Said it wasn't like someone ran over the center, that it was accidental contact as a player raised his hands up to block the kick. Didn't think it was a malicious incident.\n--Pee-Wee calls in and brings up the AL.com story on the Satsuma brothers coming up this weekend. Saban can't comment on it because of NCAA rules.\n--Saban said he hopes if anyone sees his players this week that Arkansas is really tough as opposed to giving them a pat on the back.\n--Saban is still harping on the defensive miscue that led to Nick Chubb's big touchdown last Saturday. He's brought it up multiple times since it happened.\n--Fan asks Saban how you keep team focused after big win last week. Saban says Arkansas has a really good team. Very capable of beating anyone it plays.\n--Saban says playing Arkansas used to be familiar, but now it's different because of how many teams go no-huddle, uptempo. Said he made the switch to doing more of that last year on offense because 12 of their 14 opponents used that offensive strategy.\n--Saban said he got the inspiration for Saturday's motto -- needing players to be extraordinary -- from a letter sent to him from an Alabama player that played under Bear Bryant.\nUSA Today national college football writer George Schroeder is tonight's media guest.\nSaban on Saturday's win: \"That was a good one. The players made a little bit of a statement.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:30:04.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
