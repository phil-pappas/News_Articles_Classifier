The Jackets, who began the season as favorites to win the league’s Coastal Division, must regroup before hosting No. 11 Florida State next weekend.\nBoyd, the ACC’s leading receiver this year, began the winning drive by recovering his own fumbled punt return at the Pitt 31, but he kept the chains moving with a 5-yard catch that converted the second of two fourth-down plays on the possession.\nPeterman connected with J.P. Holtz for a 6-yard TD that put the Panthers up 28-21 late in the third, their first lead since Boyd’s 6-yard catch made it 7-0 early in the first.\nPitt’s defense, which began the day seventh in the nation in yards allowed, gave up a staggering 337 yards in the first half, but the Panthers recovered to hold Georgia Tech’s potent rushing attack to just 112 yards rushing in the second half.\nPitt had to do without its season leading tackler, Jordan Whitehead, when the freshman safety left the game with a head injury late in the second and didn’t return.\nGeorgia Tech’s Marcus Marshall broke off a 58-yard touchdown run to make it 7-all in the first quarter, and quarterback Justin Thomas had runs of 51 and 45 yards to set up two other TDs.\nThe Panthers kept the score tied 21-all at the end of the second quarter when Khaynin Mosley-Smith blocked Harrison Butker’s 50-yard field-goal attempt.\nMarshall, who added a 7-run TD run to make 28-all early in the fourth, had 159 yards rushing on 10 carries. Thomas had 95 yards rushing and was 6 of 15 for 106 yards and a touchdown.\nPittsburgh 7 14 7 3—31\nGeorgia Tech 7 14 0 7—28\nFirst Quarter\nPitt_Boyd 6 pass from Peterman (Blewitt kick), 7:50.\nGaT_M.Marshall 58 run (Butker kick), 6:29.\nSecond Quarter\nGaT_Jeune 29 pass from Thomas (Butker kick), 14:52.\nPitt_Ollison 1 run (Blewitt kick), 12:40.\nGaT_Skov 1 run (Butker kick), 7:06.\nPitt_Boyd 17 pass from Peterman (Blewitt kick), 2:48.\nThird Quarter\nPitt_Holtz 6 pass from Peterman (Blewitt kick), :51.\nFourth Quarter\nGaT_M.Marshall 7 run (Butker kick), 13:35.\nPitt_FG Blewitt 56, 1:11.\nA_46,208.\nPitt GaT\nFirst downs 21 19\nRushes-yards 43-200 40-376\nPassing 191 106\nComp-Att-Int 15-23-0 6-15-1\nReturn Yards (-3) 0\nPunts-Avg. 4-40.8 3-44.3\nFumbles-Lost 2-0 3-1\nPenalties-Yards 4-30 5-54\nTime of Possession 34:20 25:40\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nRUSHING_Pittsburgh, Ollison 22-83, Hall 8-38, Peterman 5-31,\nBoyd 5-26, James 3-22.
