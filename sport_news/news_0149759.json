Klemz took first place with at time of 16:20. By Eric Turner The Capital-Journal \nThere were no changes at the top at the city boys cross country meet Saturday as Hayden’s Jacob Klemz repeated as the individual champion and Washburn Rural won the team title for the ninth straight year. \nKlemz finished the 5-kilometer race at Washburn Rural in 16 minutes, 20.8 seconds, about four seconds ahead of teammate Robbie Schmidt. Klemz won in 16:43.5 a year ago and placed second in 2013. He had a different goal in mind Saturday. \n“Winning was obviously a goal coming into today, but I was wanting to get the school record,” said Klemz, who ran 16:04.9 two weeks ago at Rim Rock to tie the Hayden record of John Etzel set in 1991. “I didn’t have the best performance. I wanted to run a better time.” \nSchmidt finished in 16:24.5, nearly 14 seconds better than third-place Pierce Flanders of Washburn Rural. \nFlanders led a Rural contingent of three of the top six finishers along with Cason Cropp in fifth and Michael Knapp in sixth. \nThe Junior Blues had eight medalists and edged Seaman 38-43 for the team race. \n“We’ve got a top core of people who’ve put a lot of time and energy into it,” Rural coach Scott Shufelberger said. “It means more to them if they get beat, so they try not to get beat. \n“That’s nine in a row. They don’t want to be the team that loses.” \nThe team title appeared to be in jeopardy halfway through the race as Seaman posed a challenge. \n“About the mile and a half mark, they were beating us,” Shufelberger said. “Our front three were up there, but their other guys were beating us. So our guys must have either ran a great last half or the Seaman guys went out a little too hard the first half.” \nSeaman finished with four of the top nine — Dawson Podlena fourth, Colton Sturgeon seventh, Noah Loethen eighth and Jordon Jensen ninth. \nBrandon Hoefner was 11th for Rural. The team race swung as Rural’s Maxx Burkholder and Maxx Bradley placed 13th and 14th ahead of Seaman’s Nathan Heinen and John Forrer in 15th and 16th. \nHunter Henderson was 10th for Shawnee Heights. \nTEAM SCORES \nWashburn Rural 38, Seaman 43, Hayden 59, Shawnee Heights 115, Topeka West 122, Topeka High 174. \nINDIVIDUAL RESULTS \n1.
