Annual appraisals were done on paper, 360 feedback evaluations were completed in a separate system, and learning and training needs were extracted by manually reading through each appraisal in the employee's personnel file, which may or may not have been complete.\nSince implementing Halogen solutions for performance and learning in 2014, Sport Wales now has a talent management system that unifies the employee performance management and 360 feedback processes with employee development programmes. The integrated online system is easy to navigate and HR and other executive leaders can automatically view important information about employee and organisational performance.\nJennifer Hill , Senior HR Officer, Sport Wales, comments on the transformation since deploying Halogen solutions: \"At Sport Wales we place significant priority on the development of our staff. That's why it was so important to us to have an efficient system in place that delivered. With Halogen in place, we are now able to accurately assess employee performance from various sources, easily link learning and development activities to improve performance, then report on individual, department and organisation performance. We see tremendous value in the fact our employee objectives and their ongoing development plans are now directly aligned to our top level organisational priorities.\"\nAbout Halogen Software\nHalogen Software (TSX: HGN) offers an organically built cloud-based talent management suite that reinforces and drives higher employee performance across all talent programmes - whether that is recruiting, performance management, learning and development, succession planning or compensation.
