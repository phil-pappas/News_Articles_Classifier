Failure to wear a seatbelt, meanwhile, was listed as a factor in 45 deaths and impaired driving was listed as a factor in 29 others.\nThe number of fatal accidents in which failure to wear a seatbelt was a factor is up so far in 2015, however OPP say that they have seen a reduction in accidents in which the other three factors played a part.\n“Drivers and passengers must be mindful of the critical role they play in changing dangerous driving behaviours. The OPP knows that enforcement works and educating the public about safe driving practices is a priority,” Deputy Commissioner Brad Blair said in a press release announcing the blitz. “Motorists will see an increased presence on our highways as OPP officers work with police across this country during Operation Impact to make Ontario’s roads the safest in the world.”\nOperation Impact is conducted each October long weekend in partnership with the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police.\nRemember for instant breaking news follow @cp24 on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:07:46.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
