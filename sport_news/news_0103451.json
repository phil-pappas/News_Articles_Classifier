A freshman running back, Rodriguez was impressive with 57 total yards and a touchdown in the Owls' 27-26 loss against Rice.\n\"There were certainly times that he looked electric,\" FAU coach Charlie Partridge said. \"We expected him to be able to do some things when he got out on the perimeter. He's got a chance to help us move forward.\"\nIt was Rodriguez's first action since being suspended the first four games of the season because of a violation of team rules. He was one of the team's most highly touted recruits in the 2014 class, but a transcript issues caused him grayshirt last year.\nAfter sitting a year, he was on pace to becoming the team's No. 3 back before being derailed by off-the-field problems.\nNow back, he expects to play a major role in the offense the remainder of the season. He averaged 7.1 yards in eight touches, including the touchdown early in the fourth quarter before play was halted because of lightning.\nRodriguez scored on a 9-yard run, putting the Owls ahead by 12 points before they faltered late. The play was reviewed by officials before it was determined the ball crossed the goaline before his knee touched.\n\"It felt like another game,\" Rodriguez said. \"I just had to get that first initial hit and all the jitters got out. It was pretty fun.\"\nStoshak injured\nReceiver Jenson Stoshak did not return after sustaining a shoulder injury in the fourth quarter. Partridge said he will be evaluated on a daily basis.\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619bdce/turbine/fl-fau-owls-notes-1010-20151010", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619b1e3/turbine/sfl-photos-rice-at-fau-20151010-029", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619aa72/turbine/sfl-photos-rice-at-fau-20151010-023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619aad5/turbine/sfl-photos-rice-at-fau-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-11T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:29:45.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
