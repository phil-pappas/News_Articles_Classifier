At least that was the view of Broncos' fans watching in disbelief as Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton raced down the field without cornerback Chris Harris shadowing him.\nThe Broncos' defensive coordinator delivered his worst performance in his last performance. Still, had Harris covered Hilton, negating chunk plays, it remains debatable if the Broncos would have won. The Broncos failed to pressure Colts' quarterback Andrew Luck, and Peyton Manning couldn't connect on long passes.\nThe Broncos were a flawed team with a broken windshield that cracked under stress, certainly not helped by coach John Fox, Del Rio and offensive coordinator Adam Gase, all of whom were eyeing employment elsewhere.\nDel Rio makes an easy villain because he's on the schedule this week and his schemes in that playoff loss backfired. He enjoyed a strong run as the Broncos' defensive coordinator, earning the right to coach the Raiders, the team he rooted for as a child. As bad as the Broncos' defense played against the Colts — uninspired and vanilla are some of the printable descriptions — it can be argued the loss was the best thing to happen.\nSimmer down. Give me a second.\nDoes anyone believe the Broncos would have beaten the Patriots in New England? To hear Denver receiver Demaryius Thomas tell it last January, some of the Broncos didn't even believe it.\nAdvertisement Had the Broncos gone to New England and played well, perhaps there would have been no coaching changes other than the dismissals of the offensive and defensive line coaches.\nFox, who won four consecutive AFC West crowns, and Del Rio had taken this team as far as they could. The crippling playoff loss created an avenue for a fresh start. Del Rio's poor playoff outing paved a way for defensive greatness this season.\nOAKLAND, CA - SEPTEMBER 13: Head coach Jack Del Rio of the Oakland Raiders looks on during the first half of their NFL game against the Cincinnati Bengals at O.co Coliseum on September 13, 2015 in Oakland, California. (Getty Images North America | Thearon W. Henderson) It remains debatable how comfortable Peyton Manning will ever be in new coach Gary Kubiak's offense, but Manning no longer has to be perfect with the Broncos running Wade Phillips' 3-4 defense.\nThe Broncos have 18 sacks, leaving them on pace for 72, which would shatter the franchise record of 57 set in 1984. By any measure, this is a championship defense. It changes how this team should be viewed. The Broncos can now win without Manning playing his best. That wasn't usually the case under Fox.\nAnd great defense travels, immune to weather permutations and schematic changes.\nDel Rio, in odd, perplexing fashion, did the Broncos a favor. Don't be angry. Be happy. The Broncos weren't winning the Super Bowl last season, and Del Rio has given them their best chance this year.\nFootnotes. The NFL will continue to look at ways to expand instant replay after the debacle in Seattle last week when the official failed to flag Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright for batting the football out of the end zone. The league can't review all penalties or the games would last five hours. But adding penalties in the end zone perhaps is a start.\nHBO's Hard Knocks crew should receive an Emmy for making the Houston Texans look like an NFL contender.\nStat to chew on: The Packers' Aaron Rodgers has thrown 48 touchdowns and zero interceptions in his past 19 home games.\nTroy E.
