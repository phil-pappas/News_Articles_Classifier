(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT \nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Adrian Beltre was excused from the Texas Rangers’ workout at the ballpark Saturday to rest his back in the AL Division Series. \nBeltre missed Game 2 on Friday because of a lower back strain that also forced the third baseman’s early exit from the series opener on Thursday. \nThe Rangers say Beltre is resting, taking medications and still considered day to day. \nBeltre will be evaluated before Game 3 on Sunday night. A Rangers’ win over Toronto would clinch the best-of-five division series.
