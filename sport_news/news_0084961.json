If his recovery is two months, he will miss the entire first round.\nRain or Shine will play the Star Hotshots in the opening game of the PBA’s 41st season today at 7 p.m. This game would have been played last Sunday but Typhoon Lando altered the schedule that included the opening ceremonies featuring the parade of 12 PBA teams and their muses.\nThe parade and the speeches will hardly matter to Guiao whose concern will focus on who will step up to fill the shoes of the injured Lee who averaged 15.5 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists last season.\n“It’s just being tough not just physically but mentally,” said Guiao after the team’s practice session yesterday at the Northeast Green Hill in San Juan City.\n“I’m confident we can survive without him. Of course, we’re definitely a different team without him. Magiging crucial ang papel ng mga rookies namin, lalo na si Maverick (Ahanmisi). It’s an opportunity for him to prove himself and rise up to the challenge,” added Guiao.\nRain or Shine though remains formidable even without Lee as the team still has its veteran core of Jeff Chan, Gabe Norwood, Beau Belga, Jireh Ibanes and Chris Tiu, who inked a one-year deal after initially thinking about retirement.\nThe other holdovers of the franchise include Jericho Cruz, Raymond Almazan, JR Quinahan and Jeric Teng. Returning to the team is free agent Ronnie Matias.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:57:20.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
