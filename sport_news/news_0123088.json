This is also one of the first papers to show these infections are increasing outside of the health care system in the community,\" Anderson said.\n\"The larger issue speaks to antibiotics,\" Anderson added. \"Antibiotics are extremely important and useful in medical care, but we know we overuse them.\"\nStudy lead author Dr. Joshua Thaden, a fellow in Duke's division of infectious diseases, added that, \"Overall, the majority of E. coli infections occurred after health care exposure, which makes all hospitals, big and small, important areas of focus to reduce transmission.\"\n\"It's important to consider that a patient's skin may be colonized with drug-resistant bacteria, but because they do not display symptoms, providers may not test them or use extensive contact precautions during care,\" Thaden said in the news release. \"We may be close to a point where it becomes worth the cost and effort to actively screen patients for resistant E. coli.\"\n U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about E. coli .\nCopyright ", "external_links": ["http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/", "http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:07:37.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
