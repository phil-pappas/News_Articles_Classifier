Cory Schneider, whose wife was due to give birth, was unavailable. \nBoucher, 22, did not score in the Devils' opening night loss to the Winnipeg Jets. He was scratched from Saturday night's game in Washington. \nIn 35 career NHL games, Boucher has eight points (three goals, five assists). \nDanis was signed as a free agent this summer to give the Devils some veteran depth. \nRich Chere may be reached at rchere@njadvancemedia.com .
