The chants of his name filled the air, underlining the fact that legends are beyond the trappings of nationality and generation. Age may have wrinkled his body but not his legend; it has only grown year after year. More so at a time when the world governing body FIFA is neck-deep in crisis and desperately in need of a figure who can win back its lost confidence. And who can be a better ambassador for football other than Pele? The 74-year-old might be reluctant to be the FIFA president but then, when did icons like him need positions to cast their influence?He showed the thousands who gathered here on Friday what it is to be a legend as he limped his way through a flight of stairs, his once prized feet fumbling, and entered the ground to shake hands with the two finalists of under-17 boys event of 56th Subroto Cup — AIFF FC and Manipur team.Pele was 15 when he first played for his club Santos and part of the Brazilian national team when just 16. His enthusiasm towards meeting young footballers was, therefore, understandable. Before that he appreciated the cultural programme by school children and skilful display by Air Warrior Drill Team of the Air Force.He later spiritedly climbed an open jeep to take a circle of the stadium. He blew kisses and waved tirelessly, often bringing his hands to his heart, to acknowledge the adulatory crowd. People craned their necks, hung on the railing of stands, screamed his name and clicked away at his moving figure to freeze this rare moment for posterity.The Brazilian, once known for his ruthlessness in front of the goal and supreme athleticism, however, didn’t come down again from his VIP enclosure for the prize distribution, as previously planned. He recently had undergone a hip surgery and obviously wouldn’t have preferred further exertion.Instead the AIFF FC captain Deependra Negi and coach Floyd Pinto, after beating Manipur 4-1 in an entertaining match, went up to the VIP enclosure to receive the prize money and trophy from the great man. The top officials of the Air Force, the organisers of the tournament, also presented Pele with a life-size portrait and a memento.“It was the most cherished moment of my life. I feel on top of the world. He appreciated our game and asked us to keep working hard. His presence inspired us,” chirped young Negi.The dark, evening sky soon sparkled with attractive fireworks but people’s eyes rested only on the ‘Black Pearl.’ They thronged around Pele’s enclosure to hear him speak. He didn’t. Instead, he waved to them again and slowly made his way back, his weeklong visit to India finally coming to a surreal end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:02:28.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
