Mosley remedied that Thursday night at Arnold High School, winning a thrilling five-set match over the Lady Marlins in the District 1-5A final. The Lady Dolphins won 25-15, 21-25, 25-21, 20-25, 15-9 to sweep the season series, earn home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs, and give coach Michelle Mask her first district crown since taking over in 2013. “This is awesome. We’ve been wanting this all year,” Mask said. “This was one of our benchmarks that we wanted to accomplish this year. We knew what winning a district championship meant in terms of having home court in the playoffs and it’s really all we’ve been talking about.” It’s a match that Mosley junior T’ara Ceasar said they’ve had circled on the calendar “for a long time.” “We’ve talked about it since we started practicing (before the season),” she said. “It feels good. We played together as a team and played great.” It was the third win in as many tries for the Lady Dolphins over their arch rivals and the fourth straight since Arnold won last year’s district championship match 3-1. That’s a match that Mosley senior Kenley Adams said stayed with her and her teammates all year. “Oh yeah, we wanted revenge,” she said. “It feels amazing. We’ve worked so hard for it. We haven’t won a district championship since I’ve been here, so it’s pretty great to win it my senior year.” The Lady Dolphins had to work pretty hard Thursday night, with Arnold forcing them to five sets for the first time in a district match this season. Mosley won the first two meetings 3-1 and 3-0, but the Lady Marlins raised their play to perhaps its highest level this season to push the Lady Dolphins to the brink. “It was a great match and we knew it would be,” Arnold coach Sheryl Heninger said. “(The Lady Marlins) competed a lot better than the last two times we played them. It was one of the best matches we’ve played all year. Unfortunately, I feel like we’ve got a different team that shows up each game. If we get that one team to be consistent every time through, I think we’ve got a shot.” Page 2 of 3 - The Lady Dolphins dominated the opening set, running off 10 of 12 points to go up 14-6 on a serve by Savannah Stanton. The lead grew to 18-8 on an ace by Adams, who finished the set off with a kill on game point. Arnold fought back in the second set, taking advantage of some early Mosley errors to jump out to a 12-6 lead following a kill by Eden Hawes. The lead was 19-7 following a kill by Casey Justice, but Mosley clawed its way back to get to within three at 24-21 on a kill by Ceasar. Another kill by Justice closed it out and leveled the match at a set apiece. Mosley led 14-7 midway through the third set, but Arnold rallied with 11 of the next 16 points to get to within one at 19-18 after a kill by Gabby Crowley following a Justice serve. Consecutive kills by Adams put MHS back up by three, with another kill by Adams and a block by Ceasar giving the Lady Dolphins set point at 24-21. Adams finished it off with a kill off her own serve to put her team up 2-1. Mosley scored seven of the first 10 points in the third set and seemed primed to close it out, but Arnold charged right back with a 6-1 run to surge ahead 9-8 on a kill by Crowley. The margin grew to 16-12 after a kill by McKinley Hart and a serve by Patricia Butherus and the Lady Marlins didn’t relinquish the lead the rest of the way. A kill by Gabby Fisher ended the set and forced a deciding fifth. Ceasar took control of the match in the final set, registering kills on the first six Mosley points to put her team ahead 6-4. Three straight serves by Savannah Gibbs culminating with a kill by Adams made it 9-4. Three straight serves by Savannah Stanton and another kill by Adams made it 13-5, and Ceasar ended the match with her seventh kill of the set and her 31st of the match. “It was a crazy match,” Adams said. “Arnold played awesome. We played great. Honestly as a team we came together better than I’ve ever seen us.” Ceasar’s 31 kills led Mosley to go with 15 digs, two blocks, and 18 serve receives, while Adams added 21 kills, 35 assists, 14 digs, 12 service points, and two aces. Kiana Yangson led with 25 digs, while Gibbs had 14 digs, 28 assists, and three aces. Justice led Arnold with 18 kills and 14 digs, with Hawes posting 15 kills, 12 digs, and an ace. Crowley had 35 assists and four kills. Hart had eight kills and three aces, and Sydney Painter had a kill and six blocks. Mosley will host its playoff opener Tuesday against the runner-up from District 2, while Arnold will be on the road against the winner. The teams could face off again Saturday for a fourth time at Mosley if they win Tuesday. Page 3 of 3 - That match, should it happen, would have a high bar to clear to best Thursday’s epic. “It was great,” Mask said. “Arnold’s a great team. They’ve got a great coach and a great squad. We knew it would be a battle. It’s always a battle. It’s one of the greatest games all year. That was pretty awesome.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:00:55.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
