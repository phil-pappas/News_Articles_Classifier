Hamlin won the Chase opener at Chicagoland and Kenseth won last week at New Hampshire to earn automatic berths in the next round.\nThe rest of the Chase grid looks like this: Jimmie Johnson is fifth, followed by Ryan Newman , Kurt Busch , Brad Keselowski, Martin Truex Jr., and Jeff Gordon. Jamie McMurray is 11th and Dale Earnhardt Jr. 12th.\nJohnson won at May in Dover for the latest of his 10 career wins on the mile concrete track.\nHarvick is 0-for-29 at Dover. He has two wins and a series-best 18 top-fives, but has busted out in the Chase. Harvick finished 42nd in the Chase opener and was 21st last week at New Hampshire. He was runner-up to Johnson in May in the first Dover race.\nHarvick thrives on pressure and took the checkered flag in must-win races last season at Phoenix and Homestead to take the championship.\nThe only excitement Friday was found inside Dover's media center.\nGordon, a five-time Dover winner, was feted by the track as he winds down his 23-year career. Gordon received proclamations from the city of Dover and Delaware's House of Representatives and Senate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:24:05.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
