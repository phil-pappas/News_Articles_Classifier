Subban"], "text": "Tweet MONTREAL -- P.K. Subban and Max Pacioretty each had a goal and an assist and the Montreal Canadiens beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-3 on Saturday night to extend their NHL season-opening winning streak to nine games. \nThe Canadiens are a victory away from matching the NHL record for the longest winning streak to open a season set by the Maple Leafs in 1993-94 and matched by Buffalo in 2006-07. Montreal is at Vancouver on Tuesday night. \nCarey Price made 49 saves, and Lars Eller, David Desharnais and Brendan Gallagher added goals. The Canadiens have won every game in regulation time. \nElsewhere in the league, Columbus came back to beat Colorado 4-3 for its first win in nine games this season, Chicago beat Tampa Bay 1-0 in overtime in a rematch of the Blackhawks' Stanley Cup victory, and Detroit ended a four-game losing streak with a 3-2 overtime win over Vancouver. \nIn Denver, Ryan Murray and Brandon Dubinsky each scored goals early in the third period as Columbus rallied for the victory. \nBoone Jenner had two goals, and Sergei Bobrovsky made 31 saves for the Blue Jackets. Their 0-8-0 start was the worst in the NHL since the New York Rangers lost their first 11 games in 1943-44. \nCoach John Tortorella got his first win with Columbus after losing at Minnesota in his first game since replacing the fired Todd Richards. \nChicago's Jonathan Toews scored his first goal of the season 17 seconds into overtime to secure the win over Tampa Bay. \nToews netted the winner when he barreled into the Tampa Bay zone and muscled between Anton Stralman and Valtteri Filppula to the net. Rookie goalie Kristers Gudlevskis stopped Toews' initial shot, but the Chicago captain knocked in his own rebound. \nCorey Crawford made 21 saves for his first shutout the season and 13th of his career in Chicago's third straight victory. \nIn Vancouver, Gustav Nyquist scored in overtime to lead the Red Wings to victory. \nThe Canucks killed off a tripping penalty on Daniel Sedin earlier in the extra period to stay alive, but were beaten when Detroit goalie Petr Mrazek fed a stretch pass to Nyquist during a Vancouver change. Nyquist moved in on Ryan Miller and buried his fourth of the season. \nIn other games, Adam Henrique scored twice and added an assist as New Jersey beat Buffalo 4-3 for its fourth straight victory after an 0-3-1 start. \nJoel Ward had a hat trick and San Jose beat Carolina 5-2 to end a three-game losing streak in front of 15,814 fans â€” the Sharks' lowest attendance in nine years. \nSam Gagner and Claude Giroux scored in a shootout to lift Philadelphia past the New York Rangers 3-2. \nDevan Dubnyk stopped 15 shots for his first shutout of the season and 15th of his career, leading Minnesota past reeling Anaheim 3-0. \nMikhail Grabovski scored his first goal of the season 4 minutes into overtime in the New York Islanders' 3-2 victory over St. Louis. \nMikkel Boedker scored three goals and Arizona beat Ottawa 4-1 to end a four-game losing streak. \nNick Bjugstad had a goal and an assist in Florida's 6-2 victory over Dallas, and Phil Kessel scored 41 seconds into overtime to lift Pittsburgh past Nashville 2-1.
