Think for a moment that we’re not even technically halfway through these 2015 playoffs yet. That midpoint becomes official once the Mets and Dodgers wrap up their half of the NLDS tonight in Los Angeles. But regardless of who is triumphant there, the truth is we’re looking at the prospect of a historic champion no matter who reigns in a few weeks.\nAdChoices The five teams alive for the World Series have each gone decades without winning it all, which is going to make for a rather tense rest of October, even for neutral fans. But with perennial recent champions like the Giants, Red Sox and Cardinals already playing offseason golf, the presence of new blood in these playoffs will make for a memorable ending either way.\nMLB PLAYOFFS 2015: Each team's most heartbreaking postseason moment | Blue Jays-Royal will be special\nBlue Jays (1993) OK, they’re at the top here, which means they have the shortest drought of anyone, but get this: In the 22 years since they last made the playoffs, the Blue Jays only finished higher than third in the American League East once (second place, 2006). That’s 20 third-, fourth-, or fifth-place finishes over that span. Toronto hasn’t really sniffed the playoffs since then, but man are they sitting pretty after a rousing comeback win in Game 5 of the ALDS against Texas. If the Blue Jays bring a championship back north of the border, expect a bronzed statue of Jose Bautista’s bat flip outside Rogers Centre by opening day next year.\nDodgers (1988) Remember those ‘88 Dodgers? Orel Hershiser and his scoreless innings streak. Kirk Gibson hitting the home run off Eckersley. Mike Scioscia ripping into the chests of all Mets fans and individually pulling out every heart and stomping on them in succession? Good times, indeed, but that’s been it for the blue crew in terms of World Series appearances. That’s expected to change this year for the $300 million Dodgers, who have two of the three best pitchers in baseball in their rotation. Like Toronto, Los Angeles’ title drought is also a World Series appearance drought, so just getting past the Cubs would mean party time in Chavez Ravine.\nMets (1986) The Mets have actually had something of a playoff history between then and now. They took the Dodgers to a seven-game NLCS in 1988. The Braves walked off (literally) in the 1999 NLCS. There was an incredible 2000 NLCS win followed by a wholly forgettable Subway Series loss. And Mets fans still wake up in night sweats over Beltrain taking that curve in Game 7 of the 2006 NLCS. So they’ve had their chances over the years — good ones, even! — but it’s never quite come together. But if they get past the Dodgers in Game 5 (and don’t over-extend Noah Syndergaard in relief of Jacob deGrom), they can throw Harvey and Sydnergaard in Games 1 and 2 at home and then again in games 5 and 6. If necessary, that would mean deGrom in a Game 7 at Citi Field and you’d have to like the Mets’ chance, no matter who* the Cubbies put out there.\n(*OK, except for Arrieta.)\nRoyals (1985) Here we meet again. By all rights, the Royals should be vying for their second-straight title, but then Madison Bumgarner had to go ahead and do what a Madison Bumgarner does, which is throw six shutout innings in relief in Game 7 and lock down the Giants’ third title in five years. So the Royals are back, arguably better than last year, and still looking for that first title since knocking off St. Louis 30 years ago. With the experience of having gone through this last year, KC’s young players (Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Sal Perez) are a year older and wiser and should be a formidable threat to knock off Toronto and make back-to-back World Series for the first time since Texas lost in 2010 and 2011. And if Johnny Cueto keeps pitching like he did in Game 5 against Houston, KC will actually go all the way this year.\nCubs (1908) So, the Cubs haven’t won the whole shebang in a while, perhaps you’ve heard? It’s only been 107 years since their last title, but it’s been 70 years since they’ve even been in a World Series. What’s really nutty is that they might be the scariest team left in these playoffs. Their young players (Kris Bryant, Kyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo and so forth) are mashing the ball with confidence and consistency. They’ve got Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester at the top of their rotation and will get two starts from each in the NLCS. The only downside for them is not having home-field advantage, but even the importance of that’s a little overblown at this stage; they’re plenty comfortable playing in either Dodger Stadium or Citi Field. Even just advancing to the World Series will be a mind-blowing sight. Winning it all would be indescribable.\nErik Malinowski is a freelance sportswriter based near San Francisco and a frequent contributor to Rolling Stone, Sports on Earth, and Uproxx.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-15/mlb-playoffs-2015-blue-jays-royals-schedule-tv-channel-players-stats", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657357-mlb-teams-worst-postseason-memory-yankees-red-sox-braves-cardinals-cubs-bill-buckner-steve-bartman-jorge-orta"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:56:59.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
