We've played him before. He's an unbelievable quarterback and an unbelievable challenge and we knew with a guy like that, he's fought through injuries before, so we knew he probably would be playing.\"\nIn seven career games against the Cowboys, Brees is 4-3, throwing for 2,421 yards, 18 touchdowns and five interceptions. In last year's 38-17 loss to Dallas, Brees was 32 of 44 for 340 yards, two touchdowns and one interception.\n\"It doesn't really matter what quarterback is playing,\" Cowboys defensive tackle Tyrone Crawford said. \"For us on the D-line, it's simple, we just play our ball out there and focus on us and do what we have to do and read our keys and everything should work out.\"\nMORE MUST-READ COWBOYS Is Brandon Weeden the answer at QB?\nCowboys VP: Brandon Weeden needs to step up, missed opportunities in Atlanta game\nMoore: The truth about Cowboys QB Brandon Weeden's ability to throw\nCowlishaw: Cowboys must test Brandon Weeden soon, because Patriots sure will\n10 things to know about Cowboys QB Brandon Weeden, including the first impression he made on Dez Bryant\nDo the Dallas Cowboys have a quarterback controversy?
