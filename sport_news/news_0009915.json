Columbia jumped Hendricks for five first-inning runs and two home runs, by Dario Pizzano and Alex Ferrera.\nHendricks pitched three years for Dartmouth — he was a first-team All-Ivy League selection as a junior and did beat Columbia as a freshman — before he was selected in the eighth round of the MLB First-Year Player Draft in 2011 by the Detroit Tigers.\nThe Mets’ lack of Ivy League players was never so glaring.\n  Filed under chicago cubs ,  columbia lions ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:30:35.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
