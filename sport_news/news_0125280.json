(AP) - Pennsylvania's most iconic chocolate maker is doubling-down on one of its most popular treats.\nThe Hershey Company on Tuesday announced its Hershey Kisses Deluxe.\nThe new Kisses, on sale Nov. 5, will be twice the size of a normal Kiss - the oversized, chocolate chips wrapped in silver foil - and feature a hazelnut center and rice crisps in the chocolate.\nThe bigger Kisses are wrapped in gold foil and, according to the company's website, will be packaged in quantities ranging from 3 to 75. The three-Kiss box will cost $1; the 75-piece gift box will be $32.\nCompany officials tell USA Today the innovation is the biggest since the central Pennsylvania company added almonds to the Kisses 25 years ago.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
