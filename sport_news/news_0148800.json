She avoided having blow-up holes, which was great considering how miserable it was out here. \n\"She was mentally sharp and didn't have her best stuff, but was able to grind out that 79.\" \nMalapit had double bogeys on No. 1 and No. 10, but made birdies on No. 11 and No. 12 to bounce back. \n\"I had a really bad hole (before No. 11), but McClung always says not to get down on myself and to look forward to the next hole and do better,\" Malapit said. \"I was really excited after those two birdies, my morale was way up.\" \nAlthough she said her driving game is usually her strength, over the past two days, her putting was her strong suit. \nWith the weather conditions causing trouble, Malapit said she stayed conservative yesterday, but tried to have an equal mix of being conservative and being aggressive on Saturday. \nOn No. 11, she was aggressive and it worked out. \n\"There were some holes I could have been more aggressive on, but look at how I did on No. 11.,\" Malapit said. \"You have to be careful, you can't always be super aggressive or you'll get doubles and triples (bogeys). \nEvansville North won the team portion of the state championship, shooting a 651 while Westfield was second with 677. Lake Central's Alexis Miestowsi had the top individual score with 145, while Evansville North's Hadley Walts and Bloomington South's Cherise Otter both shot a 151 to tie for second. Miestowsi and Walts are both sophomores. 181 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1Rnqm8E TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:19:38.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
