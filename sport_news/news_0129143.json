(AP Photo/Martin Meissner) \nLEVERKUSEN, Germany (AP) — Bayer Leverkusen squandered an early two-goal lead, then struck twice late in the match to earn a 4-4 draw with Roma in a wild Champions League group match on Tuesday. \nDaniele de Rossi scored two goals to cancel out early strikes from Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez, before Roma took a 4-2 lead on goals from Miralem Pjanic and substitute Iago Falque. \nBut Kevin Kampl began Leverkusen’s comeback in the 84th and substitute Admir Mehmedi scored two minutes later to salvage the draw. \nLeverkusen now has four points in Group E, while Roma is bottom with two points. Barcelona’s 2-0 win at BATE Borisov gave it seven points and BATE is third with three.
