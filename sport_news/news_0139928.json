At 4-2 down, Kuznetsova fought back to win the next four games and take the match.\n\"I was comfortable, had it together,\" Kuznetsova. \"There was a while in the second set when I stopped playing the right tennis, the right tactics, but then I recovered it just in time.\"\nPavlyuchenkova is one match away from retaining her Kremlin Cup title after beating Russian qualifier Daria Kasatkina 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 in just over two hours.\nPavlyuchenkova landed just 54 percent of her first serves and said she had been feeling tired after winning in Linz last week.\n\"Even being on the court was hard. My condition was really bad today,\" she said.\nIf Pavlyuchenkova wins Saturday's final, she will be the first woman to retain the Kremlin Cup title since Anastasia Myskina , now Kuznetsova's coach, did so in 2004.\nIn the men's event, top-seeded Marin Cilic of Croatia will play a semifinal against Russian wild card Evgeny Donskoy .\nCilic, last year's U.S. Open champion, swept past Russia's Andrei Kuznetsov 6-2, 6-1 in less than an hour in their quarterfinal. \"I'm very happy the way I played today. Very aggressive and I was hitting the ball very early,\" said Cilic, who is the reigning champion in Moscow.\nDonskoy won an all-Russian quarterfinal 6-3, 6-2 against Teymuraz Gabashvili.\nSecond-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain reached the other semifinal with a 6-4, 6-2 win over France's Lucas Pouille .\nHe next faces German Philipp Kohlschreiber, who won 6-2, 6-4 against Dutch player Robin Haase .", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:38:25.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
