He got what he was looking for Friday night in Virginia Tech's 28-13 victory against North Carolina State. \nRunning back Travon McMillian sealed the win when he got a key block from left guard Wyatt Teller, hurdled a defender and raced 59 yards up Tech's sideline with 6:54 left in the fourth quarter to account for the final points. Tech (3-3 overall, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) snapped a two-game losing streak. \nWith what may be a huge Coastal Division game at Miami next Saturday on tap, Beamer thinks his team is back. \n“It’s super big,” said Beamer of the significance of the win. “Get back in the conference race, and I think we’re in it, but we had to get a conference win to stay in it. We’ll see what happens with Pittsburgh and so forth, but yeah, this was critical. We as a football team, players and coaches, talked about it. Some games are just bigger than others, and this one was absolutely big. Big and critical.” \nTech quarterback Brenden Motley turned in a gutsy performance, completing 14 of 28 passes for 158 yards and three touchdowns to go along with 44 yards rushing. All three of his touchdown passes went to wide receiver Isaiah Ford in the second quarter. \nThe 2015 Virginia Tech football season in photos. \nMotley left the game for one play with 28 seconds left in the third quarter after being sandwiched between two defenders, but returned on the next drive to lead Tech through the fourth quarter despite a noticeable limp. \n\"I was just banged up a little bit,\" said Motley, who described it as an aggravation of a previous foot injury. \"It's what happens in the game. When you get banged up, you've got to get up and keep going and keep fighting. You've got to be a tough guy...At the time, you think it's worse, but you get to the sideline and get checked out and ready to go.\" Virginia Tech's Isaiah Ford discusses having \"juice\" against N.C. State \nFord on how he thinks Tech never lost its confidence, and how it was a point of emphasis this week in practice \nFord on how he thinks Tech never lost its confidence, and how it was a point of emphasis this week in practice \nHe started for a fifth straight game after Michael Brewer, who returned to practice this week a month after breaking his left collarbone in Tech's season-opening loss to No. 1 Ohio State, wasn't medically cleared to play in the game. \nMotley was particularly effective when Tech absolutely had to have a big play. \nTech converted 5 of 12 third-down opportunities, including a 17-yard pass from Motley to receiver Cam Phillips in the second quarter that moved the Hokies to the Wolfpack's 22. Motley finished the 12-play, 71-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Ford with 18 seconds left that put Tech up 21-10. \nMidway through the fourth quarter, with Tech leading 21-13, the Hokies were staring down a third-and-7 from their own 15. Motley dropped back and calmly put a perfect pass into the hands of tight end Bucky Hodges for a 26-yard gain on a deep out. McMillian scored his touchdown two plays later. \nMcMillian finished the game with 11 rushes for 96 yards and a touchdown, perhaps establishing himself as Tech's primary tailback moving forward. Other than Sam Rogers, who ran while lined up in single-back formation on several plays, no other Tech running back carried the ball. Rogers had eight carries for 57 yards. \nMcMillian's touchdown run represented the first points scored against N.C. State (4-2, 0-2) this season in the fourth quarter. \nTech offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler has referred to McMillian as \"the dude\" a few times this season. It's a term of endearment that carries an expectation of better things to come. \nBeamer shares Loeffler's enthusiasm. \n“I think he’s a guy that can make a difference in the ballgame,” Beamer said. “He’s dangerous. He’s got speed. He’s got power. Our fans are going to like that guy a lot before he leaves here. He’s got it.” \nTech's offensive line, which was largely responsible for the Hokies giving up seven sacks and producing just nine rushing yards last weekend in a 17-13 loss to Pittsburgh, recovered in style, paving the way to 200 rushing yards and just one sack surrendered against N.C. State. \n\"They were blocking really hard (Friday),\" said McMillian, adding Loeffler told him early in the week to expect to get the bulk of the carries. \"We told them that we needed them to open up the run game, and we had a really good week of practice. I think that good week of practice really benefited us during the game.\" \nFord caught touchdown passes on three consecutive possessions in the second quarter. Motley connected with him on touchdown passes of 27, 5 and 2 yards, helping the Hokies bounce back from a 10-0 deficit. Ford finished the game with four catches for 39 yards. \n\"It's like in basketball when you can't miss,\" Ford said. \"I couldn't not get open, and (Motley) was finding me. (Friday night) was special.\" \nTech's defense limited N.C. State in the second half, holding the Wolfpack to 123 yards and keeping them out of the red zone on five of six possessions. Tech finished the game up 358-270 yardage category. \nN.C. State quarterback Jacoby Brissett saw his streak of passes without an interception come to an end at 241 with 1:20 left in the fourth quarter when he was picked off by safety Adonis Alexander. Brissett finished the game 12 of 25 passing for 113 yards, a touchdown and an interception. \nBrissett's 12 completions were a season-high against Tech's defense, which is giving up 150.5 passing yards per game. Prior to Friday, Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones' 10 completions were the most against Tech this season. \nRunning back Matt Dayes entered the game averaging 104 yards rushing per game for N.C. State, but he was held to 66 yards on 14 carries. With Tech leading 21-10 in the third quarter, Dayes looked like he was hitting his stride on a drive that featured nine straight running plays, including six carries by Dayes for 33 yards. \nFacing a third-and-2 from Tech's 14-yard line, N.C. State elected to have Brissett pass instead of sticking with the run. He was hurried by linebacker Deon Clarke, forcing an incompletion. \nN.C. State had to settle for a 36-yard field goal with 56 seconds left in the quarter by Kyle Bambard, cutting Tech's lead to 21-13. \n\"We had to work (Friday),\" Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster said. \"They were doing a couple little things a little bit different, and then they kind of caught up with how we were attacking them, particularly in that one long (drive in the third quarter). We were trying to adjust, and we finally did. Our kids stepped up big on that third down play, which was critical.\" \nBrissett's evening opened up with a lot of promise. He helped N.C. State jump out to its 10-point lead with 13:56 left in the second quarter via an 8-yard touchdown pass to receiver Jumichael Ramos, who leaped over free safety Chuck Clark in the end zone to make the catch. \nN.C. State went 91 yards on 12 plays on the touchdown drive, but Tech's defense made life difficult for the Wolfpack after Ramos' touchdown. N.C. State had seven plays for minus-8 yards on its last three drives before halftime. \nLess than an hour before kickoff, fans were required to exit Lane Stadium when lightning strikes were detected near the stadium. Fans were permitted to re-enter the stadium at 7:45 p.m. \nKickoff took place at 8:06 p.m., just five minutes after the originally-scheduled start. The stadium was barely half-filled when the game started, but filled to near capacity as the rainy first quarter progressed. \nAs fans got settled, Tech sputtered through the opening quarter, failing to cross its own 42 on its first three drives while N.C. State scored on a 33-yard field goal and drove into the Hokies' red zone twice. Tech took control early in the second quarter. \n\"I told them before we left the hotel (Friday night), I go, 'We're going to find out if we're men or not,'\" Loeffler said. \"The fact of the matter is bad things are going to happen, bad things are going to happen with your family, in life. It's how you respond.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:30:05.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
