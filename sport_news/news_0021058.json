From there, he was flown in a small plane to the Sinaloan mountains, the official said.\nSeveral days ago, Mexican Attorney General Arely Gomez told Congress that authorities captured a pilot who aided Guzman. The federal official said Saturday that it was the pilot who flew the escaped drug lord in the small plane.\nFriday, Mexico's government said Guzman had avoided capture in an operation in the mountains of northwestern Mexico.\nAdvertisement A statement by Mexico's Security Cabinet said officials think the legendary drug lord injured a leg and his face fleeing Mexican marines in the rugged terrain. It provided no details on when or exactly where the operation took place, but the area of mountains of Sinaloa and Durango is in northwest Mexico.\nThe statement cited information-sharing with international agencies for leading authorities to the area.\nGuzman previously escaped from another maximum-security prison in 2001, and evaded capture for years in the mountains of Sinaloa.\nHis most recent escape strained relations with Washington, which had formally requested the drug kingpin's extradition just weeks earlier.\nA variety of U.S. officials, including lawmakers and law enforcement officials, had called for Guzman's transfer to the U.S. since his arrest in February 2014. Mexican officials, however, said Guzman wouldn't be sent to the U.S. until he had served time for all of his crimes in Mexico.\nGuzman escaped through a sophisticated tunnel that opened in the floor of his cell's shower. A surveillance video of Guzman's cell shows him walking to the shower — where there was a blind spot in the security camera's view — crouching down and then vanishing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:03:32.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
