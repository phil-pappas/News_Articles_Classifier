Elon (12-4 overall, 5-2 CAA), which is ranked as high as No. 10 in national polls, was a shutout victim for the first time this season. Hofstra (11-5, 6-1) clinched at least a share of the CAA regular-season title and the right to serve as host of the CAA Tournament from Nov. 13-15 at Hofstra Soccer Stadium. The defeat gives the Phoenix its first losing streak of the season after an overtime loss Tuesday night at Duke. Elon held Hofstra to two first-half shots, though the Pride ended up with a 13-11 edge in shots. Elon goalkeeper Matthew Jegier was credited with three saves. Walcott’s goal came when he retrieved the ball off a rebound and booted it into the net. It was the second career shutout against Elon for Hofstra goalkeeper Patric Pray. Elon is in second place in the CAA standings and can secure a bye in the conference tournament by defeating College of Charleston next weekend.
