(AP Photo/Eric Gay) \nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Nico Rosberg navigated wet conditions at the Circuit of the Americas to post the fastest time in the first practice session for the United States Grand Prix. \nWith the cars shooting giants plumes of spray behind them Friday, Rosberg’s fastest time was 1 minute, 53.989 seconds. Points leader and Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton was fifth at 1:55.693 after taking just four laps. \nHamilton is chasing his second consecutive world championship and third overall. He can clinch the title if he finishes nine points ahead of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel and two points ahead of Rosberg on Sunday. \nHamilton may have to battle wet conditions all weekend to do it. Forecasters predict heavy rain through Saturday with the potential for some showers again for Sunday’s race.
