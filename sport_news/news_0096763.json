Chase Wilkerson passed for 233 yards and one touchdown, which was caught by LJ Pope who finished with seven catches for 128 yards.Kameron Watts had a rushing TD for the Patriots, who were outscored 18-7 in the second half.“Our kids understand that you got to play big in big games,” South Paulding coach Ed Koester said. “I thought we did play really well particularly in the first half. In the second half, we had a couple of things get away from us. I think our kids understand you got to be focused for 48 minutes because you never know what play is going to make the difference in the ball game so you got to play them all hard.”The Patriots defense also surrendered 260 rushing yards and a touchdown to Russell Halimon. Quarterback Brandon Rainey also rushed for two scores.“Halimon is a good running back,” Koester said. “He did some really great things and is an Arizona commitment. He is tough to stop and they do a good job of using him. But I think the thing that broke our back was their quarterback. He played exceptionally well and had a couple of great runs at inopportune times for us. That was really kind of a difference in the game.”“It was a great high school atmosphere,” Allatoona coach Gary Varner said. “The noise definitely threw us off in the first quarter but we adjusted and handled it well in the second half. Our kids are resilient, believed the whole time and they just came through.”Now, South Paulding has to deal with a similar rushing attack, which is led by New Manchester quarterback Tabashi Thomas and running back Brian Herrien.“Their quarterback is a very gifted athlete who throws the ball well and runs it extremely well so containing him will be a big key in the game,” Koester said. “I think the running back is a very good football player and athlete.”Last Friday, the Jaguars were not off but did suffer their first loss of the season, a 46-21 setback to East Paulding at Raider Stadium.Last season, the Spartans improved to 3-0 all-time against New Manchester with a 30-17 win.“Our kids are smart kids and they are all resilient,” Koester said. “I feel confident that we can bounce back although New Manchester is very athletic and very dangerous.”After this contest, South Paulding will host Paulding County at Timothy D. Glanton, Sr. Field and not have another Friday off.“Our approach to the bye week this time around was to focus on us, correct mistakes, take a second look at some of our personnel and make sure we got kids in the right place,” Koester said. “We tweaked some things that needed tweaking and rested up because it’s a big stretch from here on out.”Even though the Spartans lost to Allatoona, Koester remained positive about the team finishing as Region 5- champions.“All of our goals are still ahead of us,” Koester said. “Even with the loss to Allatoona, we can end up as region champs -- that is something we set out to do. If the cards fall in the right place, we can still be region champions. All of the goals that we set in the preseason are still available to us. There are six solid opponents ahead of us and any one of them can sneak up on us so we got to be prepared to play every week.”Last week, East Paulding was the only team in Paulding County in action but Friday each team will be on the field. Hiram will visit Lithia Springs and the Raiders will travel to Paulding County. Last year, the Patriots edged the Raiders 12-10 and the Hornets cruised past the Lions 41-9.In Class , North Paulding will host Harrison and seek a 2-0 start in region competition. Last season, the Wolfpack won the matchup 49-35.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:08:58.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
