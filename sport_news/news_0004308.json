Joe Nicholson / USA Today Oct 8, 2015 at 11:03p ET 0Shares \nTrailing 6-3 in the third quarter against USC on Thursday night, Washington head coach Chris Petersen thought it was about time to dive into his bag of tricks. \nPetersen called for a double pass, which completely fooled the Trojans defense. Huskies QB Jake Browning tossed a pass to wide receiver Marvin Hall , who in turn quickly flicked the ball to Joshua Perkins for a 27-yard touchdown. It's a touchdown! @UW_Football gets tricky and grabs a 10-6 lead. #UWvsUSC http://t.co/M1xRkg36Ce â€” Pac-12 Networks (@Pac12Networks) October 9, 2015 \nNice call, coach Petersen.
