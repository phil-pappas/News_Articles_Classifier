Authorities retrace Lamar Odom's visit to Nevada brothel   \nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Authorities are retracing Lamar Odom's $75,000 visit to the brothel to find out why the former NBA and reality TV star was found unconscious. \nThere's been no official word on Odom's condition at a Las Vegas hospital, but the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Wednesday he's on life support. Odom's grandmother, Florence Odom, declined to comment on his status Thursday, saying she was distressed at unfounded speculation that her grandson would be taken off life support. His father, Joe Odom, also declined to discuss his condition, saying that information was confidential. kAm}J6 r@F?EJ =2H 6?7@C46>6?E 2?5 3C@E96= @77:4:2=D D2:5 ~5@>VD :?4:56?E H2D 2 C2C:EJ 7@C E96 {@G6 #2?49[ :?
