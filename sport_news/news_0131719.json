He gets the start again tonight as the Royals open their final regular-season series of 2015 at Minnesota. \nYoung has been tough to hit all season, holding opposing batters to a .203 batting average. And he has been lights-out against right-handers, who have been frustrated to the tune of a .165 average this season -- the lowest mark against any hurler with more than 100 innings pitched. That's 48 points lower than Young's career mark of .213 against right-handed batters, which is second only to Clayton Kershaw (.211) among active pitchers who have thrown at least 1,000 innings.
