Those are pretty explosive plays.” \nUNC scored on a fourth consecutive drive, highlighted by a 61-yard reception by Austin Proehl which fell just short of the goal line, to take a 29-14 lead into halftime. \n“It’s a rhythm thing,” Proehl said. “The more the game goes on – it’s like coach (Seth) Littrell says, you get one first down and you just move. You get in a rhythm, you get a spark and you keep going.” \n“One thing happens and another thing happens and things just keep rolling. We keep (defenses) on their heels and that’s big for our offense.” \nNorth Carolina covered 413 of 538 total offensive yards on 20 plays that were each longer than 10 yards. The Tar Heels scored all but one of their touchdowns on drives shorter than two minutes and three of those drives were sub-one minute drives as the team proved just how fast it can be when it’s working right. \n“They love it, they love scoring quick,” Fedora said. “It makes it hard on your defense because they’re – I think the defense was out there for 37 minutes – it’s tougher on the defense but I don’t think the defense gets too upset about it.” \n“When we get going, it’s hard to stop us,” said Hollins, who caught three passes for three touchdowns. “Our job is just start off as quick as possible. If we can do that, you can see what we can do. You take away the first quarter, it looks like nobody can stop us. We've just got to be able to come out first quarter and do it.” \nThe win moved North Carolina to 2-0 in ACC for first time since 1997 and to 5-1 on the season for first time since 2011. The trouncing was the most points UNC has scored against WF since 1994’s 50-0 shut out, but all the marks mean nothing for the team that knows it, “can’t get complacent,” Williams said. \n“We know we can run you out of our stadium,” he said. “It’s just exciting just to see the future of our offense if we just keep improving. We’ve got to execute, find a way to beat whatever (defenses) throw at us. As an offense, there’s going to be stuff you can’t control but it’s how you respond to the adversity and we continue to respond very well.” \nAnd the pace of that response is continuing to speed up, too. \n“We know we can go faster,” Hollins said. “I don’t think there’s any team that can keep up with us if we keep rolling.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:48:50.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
