LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis Rams fans appear eager to let the NFL know how they feel about the franchise's possible relocation to Los Angeles. \nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch ( http://bit.ly/1S0JuJU ) reports that the NFL has closed registration for Tuesday night's scheduled public hearing on the matter at St. Louis' Peabody Opera House. \nThe league closed the registration Thursday, saying the 1,500 available seats are now claimed. \nRams owner Stan Kroenke is seeking to move the franchise to Los Angeles. A new billion-dollar riverfront stadium is being proposed in St. Louis, though it's unclear if the city will have an NFL team when such a stadium is finished. \nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
