That’s the good news. \nBut like we’ve seen throughout this season with the Ducks, even the victories seem to provide more questions than answers. \nWith graduate transfer Vernon Adams out with a broken finger, Oregon rotated two quarterbacks — junior Jeff Lockie and sophomore walk-on Taylor Alie — and neither was particularly impressive. \nLockie completed 8 of 11 passes for 54 yards, no touchdowns and one interception — his interception was thrown in the end zone. Lockie also rushed for 18 yards. \nAlie completed 4 of 9 passes for 83 yards, with one touchdown and no interceptions. He also rushed for 22 yards. \nOn Sunday, Oregon coach Mark Helfrich said that he is comfortable using two quarterbacks moving forward “if it makes sense.” \n“The game plan last week dictated that, and there were some things that I thought both guys would do better than the other guy, if that makes sense,” said Helfrich, whose team hosts Washington State at 3 p.m. Saturday at Autzen Stadium. “I think they’re both capable of executing the whole thing but they played well enough and execute to their deal at a high enough level to warrant that. We’re not done game planning for Washington State yet so that, we’ll see.” \nThe Ducks had 81 plays on offense against Colorado, and 60 of them were on the ground, as they rushed for 361 yards. \nExpect more of that from Oregon this season. \nThe Ducks have great options at running back, with Royce Freeman (163 yards, two touchdowns) and Taj Griffin (110 yards and a touchdown) having big games at Colorado. \n“We know how great Royce is, and he was getting stronger and stronger as the night went on,” Helfrich said. “And part of that is being able to have a guy go in and spell him a little bit. And Kani Benoit has been doing a really good job. Tony Brooks-James is improving. So our depth there is good. \n“Whenever you can run the ball, you can kind of do anything,” Helfrich added. “And so that’s, obviously, something that we want to get going.” \nThe coaching staff did a good job of recognizing the limitations they have at quarterback right now and found creative ways to get the ball to their playmakers, including moving the quarterback out of the pocket, running the option and even executing a reverse with wide receiver Bralon Addison throwing a touchdown pass to Charles Nelson. \nUntil Adams is 100 percent, which might be the Oct. 29 game at Arizona State, the Ducks will need to continue their creative game planning. \nOregon has Washington State this week, and then travels to Washington on Oct. 17. The Ducks then have a bye before traveling to Arizona State. \nCan Oregon sweep the Washington schools with its current quarterback situation? Yes. \nThe Ducks’ defense showed much improvement against Colorado, with the front seven getting five sacks, which matches what they had in the first four games combined. And Oregon held Colorado to 77 rushing yards. \n“There’s definitely progress,” Helfrich said about the defense. “I think we improved in every phase, which is encouraging, but there’s still a lot of meat on the bone in every phase, which again, glass half-full, glass half-empty type of situation. We did a nice job in four-man pressure. Again, as the night went on, creating a ton of pressure, making them as one-dimensional as possible was big.” \nThe secondary is still a work in progress, but really for the first time this season, there was improvement. \n“We made a few plays in the secondary, and we missed a few plays in the secondary,” Helfrich said. “But coming out of that, I think we’ll do nothing but improve.” \nOregon is 3-2 this season, including 1-1 in the Pac-12, and are not ranked in the AP poll for the second week in a row. \nThe Ducks have been hit hard by critics this season, particularly with the quarterback situation, and that criticism intensified last week after they lost 62-20 to Utah at Autzen Stadium. \nBut it’s important to understand how good the teams that beat Oregon — Michigan State and Utah — are this season. Michigan State is unbeaten and ranked No. 4 in the nation, and Utah is undefeated and ranked No. 5. \nThe Ducks have talent, and they still control their own destiny in the Pac-12 North. \nBut, as we saw Saturday night, win or lose, every week will be a grind. 14 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://stjr.nl/1Rq4glL TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:11:42.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
