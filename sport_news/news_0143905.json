That year, a group of community organizations led by the Chesterfield Community Council drafted legislation called the “Illinois Conflict Resolution Act.” Introduced in Springfield by former State Rep. Constance Howard, it required school districts with populations of more than 150,000 to provide three weeks per year of education in violence prevention and conflict resolution from kindergarten through high school. School districts could include it in their social studies curriculum.\nWe held community hearings to inform people and build support for the law. During the hearings, we discussed the breakdown of the family structure and the need for more government intervention in some instances. On July 8, 2011, Gov. Pat Quinn signed the bill. But since then, no school district, including Chicago, has funded this initiative.\nOur kids are inundated with violent images on television and in games. I realize that this law is not a cure-all for the violence plaguing our streets. But until there is a return to solid families structures, we must take aggressive action to encourage our youth that violence is not the answer.\nEli Washington\nChairman\nChesterfield Community Council\nSEND LETTERS TO: letters@suntimes.com .

Murder with gun – death penalty\n2. Shooting and wounding somebody — 20 years without parole.\n3. Using a gun or claiming to have a gun while committing a robbery — 10 years, no parole.\n4. Straw buyer purchase of gun — 5 years, no parole.\nGet tough on gun crime the right way.\nRon Scacco, Barltett\nAccess to guns is the problem\nCongratulations on the timing of your Thursday editorial on guns — right after another round of senseless gun violence in Chicago and before the mass shooting in Oregon. As usual, you have missed the point. There are more than 300 million people in this country and almost 300 million guns. The wrong people will always have access to guns. And the threat of prison for gun crimes is no more a deterrent than the threat of the death penalty is for murder. Doomsday will come and go before that strategy wins the battle. In the meantime, gang shootings and bystander casualties will continue. There will be another mass shooting, and another and another. Gun control is a myth. Illegal guns aren’t the problem. Access to guns is the problem.\nMichael Hart\nWest Ridge", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:56:18.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
