Western Illinois defeated Southern Illinois 37-36. \nLAST TIME : Western Illinois defeated USD 44-29 last year at the DakotaDome and have won three straight times. \nRANKINGS : Western Illinois is receiving votes in both FCS polls. \nRADIO : KVHT-FM 106.3/1570 (Yankton/Vermillion); KQSF-FM 95.7 (Sioux Falls); KUQL-FM 98.3 (Mitchell); KKSD-FM 104.3 (Watertown); KIMM 106.7/1150 (Rapid City) \nLIVE CHAT : Mick Garry will host a live chat from the game at argusleader.com Summer of bond-building now tested for South Dakota Coyotes \nINTRODUCTION : These are a pair of Missouri Valley Conference programs who have felt the brunt of the league’s collective ascendance as an FCS power conference. Both are looking to climb up out of perennial appearances toward the bottom of the MVFC standings and the Leathernecks made a move toward that with a win last week over Southern Illinois. \nTHE GAME : After a disappointing performance at home against a good team last week, the Coyotes head to Macomb, Illinois, this week to sort out their issues. Historically for USD, the Western Illinois contest has always looked winnable on paper, but during the FCS era the Coyotes have never taken advantage of the opportunity with a sound effort. Two years ago, a 24-14 loss was particularly disappointing and last year’s DakotaDome loss was another conspicuously poor effort. \nIn a world where challenges are opportunities, this will be a week for the Coyotes to show that last week’s issues on offense were an aberration and that last week’s impressive defensive effort was a sign that more of the same is coming throughout the season. \nWhen the Coyotes have been able to run the ball this year they’ve won. When they can’t, they lose. Starting tailback Trevor Bouma, who has run for 329 yards on 47 carries, will be healthy enough to play after sitting out the second half last week with a sprained ankle. \nThe Leathernecks are young on defense, particularly in the secondary, so there should be better opportunities for Ryan Saeger (50-96-618 yards) to find open receivers than last week. If he’s repeatedly have to throw in third-and-long situations, however, it’s going to be more difficult. Hence the need to be able to consistently run the ball. \nTHE INJURIES : The Coyotes have no injuries to report. Enter weekly pick 'em contest, win prizes \nWESTERN ILLINOIS : The Leathernecks have a quarterback in Trenton Norvell who has 28 starts and a wide receiver in Lance Lenoir who also has 28 starts. Both are strong players with Norvell throwing for 920 yards in four games. Lenoir has 26 catches for 360 yards, which is more than twice as much as any Coyote receiver. The game could hinge, however, on the Coyotes’ ability to deal with Nikko Watson, a 250-pound tailback who has averaged 165 yards and 5.9 yards a carry over the last two games. \nOPINION : If the Coyotes are to come out of 2015 looking a lot better than they were in 2014, now is the time to prove it. They’ll have to do by unshackling the offense a week after nothing worked out the way they wanted.
