Settle in early for the New York Mets vs. the Los Angeles Dodgers because the starters will dazzle. \nThey did that Friday night at stifling Dodger Stadium, to be sure. For the first six innings of the opening game of their National League Division Series, what could have been more enjoyable or electrifying than watching deGrom, the Mets’ long-maned right-hander, and Kershaw, the Dodgers’ scruffy lefty, fire pellets at the opponents? \nTurns out, though, that’s the preamble. We learned, in the Mets’ stirring 3-1 victory, that starting pitching might define the series. The bullpens will decide it. [ Lackey pitches Cardinals past Cubs in other NLDS game ] \nThere’s no doubt deGrom’s performance was the signature Friday, and he will forever be the player most remembered from Game 1. Ever heard of Tom Seaver? Before Friday, he was the only Met to strike out 13 hitters in a postseason game — 42 years ago. Then deGrom did it, seemingly with ease in seven innings. He allowed five hits. His only walk was intentional. Once he erased the Dodgers’ only two-runner threat — first and second, one out in the fourth — he sat down the final 11 men he faced. Throw in Daniel Murphy ’s solo shot off Kershaw, and the Mets had all they needed. \nBut there was one moment that, inescapably, tilted this game to the Mets. And it set up an unsettling feeling for the Dodgers for the rest of the series. \nThrough six innings, Kershaw had all but matched deGrom, striking out 11 and allowing only that Murphy homer in the fourth. But in the seventh, he was tiring. He walked Lucas Duda leading off. With one out, he got ahead of Ruben Tejada 1-2 — but lost him, putting men on first and second. When deGrom executed a bunt to push runners to second and third, it made sense that Kershaw would have one hitter — the lefty-swinging Curtis Granderson — before he could be done for the night. \nWhen Granderson came up, Kershaw was still throwing hard — 95 mph on his 110th pitch. But his command was off. When he missed, he missed badly. With 112 pitches behind him, he threw a 95-mph, 3-2 fastball. Granderson took it — just outside, Kershaw’s third walk of the inning. The bases were loaded. [ Rangers take 2-0 lead on Blue Jays in 14 innings ] \nThe dilemma: Mets third baseman David Wright , a savvy and accomplished right-handed hitter, was next up. Wright had walked in the first inning, but then struck out twice against Kershaw, making him 3 for 16 in his career against the man who, more seasons than not, is the best pitcher on the planet. But it would be Kershaw’s fourth time through the order, and his faltering command would be a good indication of fatigue. There was, too, some precedent that played in here, precedent that had to weigh on the mind of Dodgers Manager Don Mattingly. Kershaw, all of Los Angeles — and, indeed, all of baseball — knows, is somehow not exactly the same pitcher in the postseason. His career ERA in the regular season: 2.43, the best of any active starter. His career ERA in 11 postseason appearances prior to Friday: 5.12. \nBut the precedent gets even more specific. Last year, in Game 1 of the NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals right here, Kershaw entered the seventh inning with a 6-2 lead. By the time Matt Carpenter came to the plate, the Cards trailed just 6-4, and the bases were loaded. Right-hander Pedro Baez was warming in the bullpen, but Mattingly stuck with Kershaw. Carpenter tagged him for a bases-clearing double, Baez came in a batter too late, and Kershaw lost. \nJust four days later, Kershaw carried a 2-0 lead into the seventh in St. Louis, with the Dodgers needing to win to stay alive. When the first two Cardinals reached base, Mattingly again had Baez warm. But left-handed Matt Adams was coming up, so he stuck with Kershaw for one more hitter. You guessed it: Adams took Kershaw deep, the Cardinals won 3-2, and the Dodgers’ season was over. [ Royals edge Astros, even series at 1-1 ] \nWith that as the backdrop, what was Mattingly to do? Bases loaded, down 1-0, the right-handed Wright coming up. He stepped from the dugout, walked to the mound — and called for Baez. \nThere is no Met more excited, relieved, ecstatic — pick an adjective — to be in the postseason than Wright, the modern version of Mr. Met, who wandered through the wilderness with this franchise for a decade. Facing Baez for the first time in his career, he worked the count full. And when Baez came with 99-mph heat, Wright was ready, such a professional response in a moment that called for professionalism, driving the ball back up the middle. \nDuda scored from third. Tejada came around from second. Wright pumped his fist with gusto at first. The Mets had vanquished Kershaw, sure, and all three runs were charged to him. \nBut more importantly for the rest of the series, they had pushed doubt into the mind of Mattingly, doubt into the 54,428 fans who rocked the stadium. In this series, when the starters are tiring, what’s the right response: Stick with the aces, or pull another card? Whoever answers that question correctly more times than not will win this series.
