The Miami Heat are looking to reclaim a spot at the top of the Eastern Conference, but Dwyane Wade knows that road leads through LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nAdChoices In an interview with ESPN, Wade said he hasn’t bothered telling James about Miami’s aspirations because the Cavaliers star already knows his former team’s mindset.\n“Some things you don’t have to talk about. LeBron knows we’re coming for him. They’re at the top of the Eastern Conference, everybody is going for them.”\nCleveland is hoping to take the next step after representing the East in the NBA Finals but falling short against the Golden State Warriors for the title.\nMiami, on the other hand, is looking to bounce back from an injury-riddled campaign that wasn’t helped by LeBron’s departure during the summer. When Wade and Chris Bosh missed time, the roster was without the Big Three that had guided the team for the previous four seasons.\nBut as Wade mentioned in the interview—at least for now—the Heat are at full strength, which isn’t a luxury Cleveland currently has. Kyrie Irving, Iman Shumpert, Kevin Love, Matthew Dellavedova and J.R. Smith are battling injuries, and Tristan Thompson still isn’t under contract.\nThe Cavaliers will host Miami on the opening weekend of the 2015-16 season, and Wade will have a chance to remind James that the Heat are ready to challenge him for the Eastern crown.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=13939969", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:57:58.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
