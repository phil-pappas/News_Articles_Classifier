Good luck, kid. theSkinny81 October 14, 2015 at 6:27 pm | Permalink \nI’ve been to both the Volkswagen and Audi dealerships in Lawrence, and you aren’t lying – there is nothing there.

Kansas has no shot at the Title and i am being nice for Rupp’s sake he came out of Kansas .Kentucky develop’s NBA players ! I know some people want to be the star of there team. Excuse me but the NBA has teams of the best of the best the Top Guns.To be the best you must face the best day in and day out you know like Kentucky players do .I understand Kentucky isn’t for everyone and thats OK .But Kansas , Puke, N.C. please have class go see Kevin at Vandy Vandy is an class act and needs some top players. I would love to see Vandy in the hunt every year because they are class and have the second best coach in the SEC .I wish Mr Bolden the best with his career but you are making an huge mistake as some others have done over the pass 6 years but it’s not to late watch BBM on TV and see what you are missing ! Does Kansas have weekly reports like Kentucky what our Cats done in the NBA this week. This is an family an huge Blue family for life who’s support follows you threw out your life. .
