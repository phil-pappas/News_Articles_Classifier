Those conversations will remain private and we will refrain from further comment at this time.\" \nThe report revealed a witness had called police when she saw Manziel's white Nissan pass her at high speed using the shoulder of the road. \nCrowley also reportedly tried to exit the vehicle while they were driving and threw the football player's wallet out of the car window at one point. \nWhen police stopped the couple, the report said Crowley told police Manziel had pushed her head into a window, but police determined an abrasion on her arm was due to Manziel's attempt to keep her from exiting the vehicle while it was moving. \nThe couple were not charged because according to the report, police believed the couple were not intoxicated to the point of being charged, and Crowley had told officers she was not interested in pressing charges. \nThe report said both left the scene in Manziel's car. \nCopyright   Friday, October 16, 2015 at 7:06PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:55:44.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
