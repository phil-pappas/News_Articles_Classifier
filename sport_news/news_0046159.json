The coaches agreed to move the game to Saturday after rain forced their previous matchups to be rescheduled to the start of this week. Thomas Dale Knights head coach Kevin Tucker anticipates a packed house for the lone Central District contest on Oct. 10. \"We don’t expect it to be a blowout on one side of the ball or the other,\" Tucker said, noting it could be a \"knockdown, drag-out, four-quarter football game.\" Dinwiddie Football head coach Billy Mills agreed: \"We always have wars - expecting it to be the same.\" In looking ahead to their coming game, Mills pointed to the Knights' \"tremendous defense\" - the linebacker core is the best they've seen, the defensive line is big and fast, especially at the end, they make up for being a little smaller in one of the D-tackle spots in quickness and strength, and they have perhaps the best secondary that Mills has seen in a while. \"They’re very good at locking you down and they tackle well,\" Mills said. \"They’ve got great vision, play the ball well. it’s going to be a real challenge to get the ball up to our receivers this week.\" Thomas Dale battled a little bit of rust on both sides of the ball along with their opponent Prince George as both teams didn't have that time to get outside for practice. \"Offensively, we turned the ball over on those first three possessions and that’s just comes from the rust, not being able to be out there. We were in the gym for two days last week because of the rain and then the county shut us down on Friday, so we didn’t get to practice, so we had a little quick walkthrough on Monday,\" Tucker said. \"But until you get out there and you can be full speed in game action, that’s hard to simulate what you need to do.\" But as has been the case for almost all year, the Knights' defense clamped down on the Royals, limiting them to 8 points in the game. Tucker also pointed to the turnovers that they've been creating, and gave credit to his defensive coaches Dennis Jones (defensive coordinator), Eric Richardson (defensive backs and special teams) and Quentel \"Q\" Lambert (wide receivers/linebackers) for getting the defenders to where they're flying around and making great plays. \"If you take away the 21 points offense gave up versus Bird, our defense is averaging about six points a game given up. Which is amazing, that’s one of the top defenses in the area,\" Tucker said. \"I think those three guys (Jones, Lambert, Richardson) are doing a heck of a job with that unit over there this year. That’s going to carry us a long way this year.\" Dinwiddie With a really good practice on Wednesday, Mills feels like his athletes are coming together; he said they're still a tight-knit group, and they're not letting last week's loss separate them. As the Generals move forward, Mills said they needed to do a better job with fundamentals. He expressed his disappointment in execution on the offensive side of the ball over the past two weeks. \"Things that we were doing well two weeks ago, we’ve kind of regressed on. We had to shift our focus a little bit more toward the defensive side because we weren’t doing very well on defense, but I anticipated us being able to at least maintain where we were offensively,\" he said. \"I think we regressed little bit ... there’s things that we worked very hard on, the details and the little things and execution, and we didn’t do a very good job with that this last Monday.\" With Dinwiddie coming off a 32-22 defeat to Matoaca, Tucker said that, in viewing film, Dinwiddie's still a very talented team. \"They had some bad breaks in the game, and I think that Matoaca did a great job of executing and taking advantage of those breaks as far as the turnovers, the safeties, working with a short field,\" Tucker said. But when he looks at the game, that's not the Dinwiddie Generals that Tucker and his Knights expect to see Saturday. \"We expect to see a team that’s disciplined, well-coached; they’ll have their game plan ready and in effect,\" he said. Mills said his team had to continue to get better in all phases. He noted that, even though his Generals blocked a Matoaca punt and returned it for the touchdown, they still lost the special teams battle that night due to giving the Warriors the short field pretty much every time on the kickoff and, after the Generals defense would force the punt, the offense would be backed up inside their 10. But Mills did note that, outside of a busted assignment and a given-up long pass, defense did a tremendous job against Matoaca through the first three quarters, keeping them in sight at 16-14 - even with multiple turnovers by the offense in the first half - before the Warriors took off near the end of the game and doubled their score. \"Offensively, first half, we moved the ball, we had drives going,\" Mills said before adding that his quarterback Bryce Witt \"had a tough game. \" \"Sometimes you go through that. He's still a junior quarterback,\" Mills said. \"He still has some growing pains ... He's still our guy -- and I still feel really good about him.\" And Mills is confident in his players as a team. \"We’ll come together and we’ll right the ship.\" Game Time Dinwiddie plays the Knights at Thomas Dale High School (3626 W Hundred Rd, Chester) on Saturday, October 10, 1 p.m. Thomas Dale is 4-1.
