Photos by Steve Spring. Researchers in Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands studied the effects that ingredient had on multiple species of coral.\nThe study concluded oxybenzone \"poses a hazard to coral reef conservation and threatens the resiliency of coral reefs to climate change.\"\nOne of the biggest climate change threats to coral is something called coral bleaching . (Video via NOAA )\nThings like changing ocean temperatures and polluted runoff can cause algae that lives on coral to leave, making the coral pale in color.\nBut it's about more than just looks — coral depends on algae for food. And without algae, coral is prone to disease.\nIn the study, the larval form of coral showed more coral bleaching with more exposure to oxybenzone. (Video via NOAA )\nThe findings showed that even a small amount of the ingredient can damage coral.\nAs The Washington Post put it, \"The equivalent of a drop of water in a half-dozen Olympic-sized swimming pools\" can have negative effects.\nOh, and people collecting samples for the study didn't wear sunscreen, in case you were wondering.\nThe video includes an image from Getty Images.\nTrending on Facebook\nBride's family donates reception meal to homeless after groom cancels wedding What killed man who bit another passenger on Aer Lingus flight?
