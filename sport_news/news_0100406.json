(Photo: Robin Buckson, Detroit News) \nThe Lions received some good news about a couple of potentially devastating injuries.\nQuarterback Matthew Stafford underwent X-rays on his left, non-throwing hand after Sunday's loss to the Vikings, but coach Jim Caldwell said Monday they came back negative.\nCornerback Rashean Mathis left the game late to undergo testing for a brain injury, but he did not suffer one, according to Caldwell.\n\"It was deemed that he did not have a concussion, so he was cleared to go back into the game and he is fine today,\" he said of Mathis.\nStafford suffered the left hand injury at some point in the third quarter. After one drive, trainers dressed the hand with black tape before Stafford put a glove over it. He said the injury didn't impact his play, though Dan Orlovsky was warming up while Stafford dealt with trainers.\nDETROIT NEWS\nNiyo: Warning signs pointed to Lions' defensive woes\nStafford took seven sacks and 13 quarterback hits in the game, which the Vikings won 28-19 after the Lions once led 17-6.\nMathis underwent some concussion testing early in the game after tackling running back Adrian Peterson in the first quarter. He returned after missing just a few plays, but exited again in the fourth quarter.\nThe Lions can't afford to lose Mathis, who has started 36 games at cornerback for them the past three years.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:50:26.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
