I knew I was wrong for doing it, but I had a lot of stress on my mind and I needed a day off, but that was the wrong day to take off, and I'm really sorry I did it.\" \nRecent family strife, Smith said, caused him considerable stress, so instead of Monday's practice, he went to the junior varsity football game at 29th and Chalmers to clear his mind. \nAs penance, first-year head coach Damond \"Smash\" Warren didn't start Smith on Thursday, an important game with playoff implications for the Mustangs (2-2, 2-3). \nPerhaps as repayment, Smith played with abandon, racking up three rushing touchdowns and adding another in the air. \nHe also returned a third-quarter fumble, which set up a touchdown, and added a 50-yard kickoff return that led to his winning touchdown and two-point conversion. \nHe also learned a valuable lesson. \n\"Never let my team down and never give up,\" he said. \"And if it's not very, very important, practice always comes first. I love my team.\" \n\"He paid his discipline,\" Warren said. \"After a while I put him back in for us and he did his thing. He's a good kid.\" \nSmith finished 3 of 6 for 63 yards in the air and added 19 yards on 8 carries. \nFor Boys' Latin (0-4, 2-4), senior quarterback Troy Hester finished with four ground touchdowns and 89 yards on 25 carries. Rasheed Wilson added an interception for the Warriors. Javon Oglesby-Rice blocked two punts. \n\"I really let my team down so I had to make it up to them, Smith said. \"I thank my line, and our defense played very, very hard. We needed this win for a playoff spot and we did what we had to do.\" \nDobbins 8 6 6 8 - 28 \nBoys' Latin 6 6 2 12 - 26 \nBL: Troy Hester 1 run (run failed) \nDB: Wonsale Dahkwe 52 pass from Brandon Smith (Andre Witherspoon run) \nBL: Hester 2 run (run failed) \nDB: Smith 1 run (pass failed) \nBL: Safety \nDB: Smith 1 run (run failed) \nBL: Hester 4 run (run failed) \nBL: Hester 7 run (run failed) \nDB: Smith 5 run (Smith run)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:41:31.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
