The Dodgers’ Triple-A team excelled once it left Albuquerque. The Rockies’ Triple-A team arrived and did not.\nAt the next level, the emergence of Toronto and Houston – the latter arriving a little early – has sparked great interest and hope for franchises slogging in the mud. The Dodgers and their $300 million payroll won their third straight NL West title. Washington and its accumulation of talent gravely disappointed – Nationals fans, anyway.\nThe Rockies were bad, pardon the repetition. But the silver lining to go with all that purple is that poor seasons means high draft choices. High draft choices mean potential stars threading their way through Isotopes Park before they hit the Mile High City. No reason in the world not to bring the parent club’s top prospects to Mile High Lite.\nColorado fans, we kid because we care. Besides, I watched the Rox employ a very Isotope-ish pitching staff to beat the beloved Atlanta Braves in two games of a four-game sweep in Denver. Atlanta went on a “break it down to build it back up” campaign in 2015. Well, management got the “break it down” part done right.\nWe could have a World Series involving Los Angeles or the New York Mets that could make TV executives happy. Prior to Wednesday night’s game, we also could have had a Toronto-Pittsburgh pairing that would have had some committing — what’s the term? — Harry Caray.\nAnyway, there are other things to like about the emerging trends.\nGame times are down, offense is up. Both developments needed to happen. The experiment of the pitch clock in Double- and Triple-A also worked. The games didn’t devolve into cricket or anything, and the players ideally will develop habits to carry into their big-league careers.\nNow, could the sport be better? Relative to the postseason, sure. If the baseball world was ruled from this computer:\n⋄ No Game 163: I always in principle feel less is more, and the regular season should be as meaningful as possible. If two teams tie for a wild-card or the division title, the winner of the head-to-head season matchup is the champion. Head-to-head is the first tie-breaker in the NFL, and that’s a fairly successful operation.\nThen suddenly you have a very meaningful Game 19 between the Yankees and Red Sox (which means the 19th one airing on ESPN) if the series is tied 9-9 and both are in contention for the AL East title. Or maybe a deciding seventh game of the season between the Rangers and Tigers, knowing that the season-series winner might get an edge in the wild-card chase. Which brings up another proposal:\n⋄ One wild-card team, not two: That’s obviously a regression that won’t happen. Imagine, however, if the Cubs and Pirates – two very good teams capable of going all the way – were battling this past weekend for postseason life, not simply home-field advantage for Wednesday night’s pairing. How exciting would that have been?\nBesides, just one wild-card team in each league instead of two facilitates the next big idea:\n⋄ Top seed in each league declares its first-round opponent: The idea that all the games start simultaneously on Finale Sunday was inspired. Next time, one hour after the last out is recorded and the playoff teams are determined, have the team with the best record in each league submit to the commissioner whom it wants to face in the first round. Doesn’t have to be the wild-card team. It could be an opponent it feels is a better match-up. The other two teams in the league pair off, best record getting home-field advantage.\nThen you can have a Sunday night postseason show, similar to the College Football Playoff or NCAA Tournament selection shows, announcing the matchups. That just might get ridiculously excellent ratings.\nAnd then for the few days between the announcement and the first pitch of the series, the chatter begins. Imagine the cries of “No respect! No respect!” (no, ex-Lobo-types Kendall Williams, Drew Gordon and Steve Alford didn’t trademark the phrase) from the team picked as the sacrifice at the altar.\n⋄ Rotate World Series home-field advantage between the two leagues: It’s arbitrary, to be sure, but it’s fair. It’s silly to pretend something should be at stake in the grandest exhibition game in our sports culture. Let that at least be fun.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/harrison-for-web-175x171.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:15:06.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
