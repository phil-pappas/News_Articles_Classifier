When it comes to the activity, you pick two and they can’t be too closely related.\n“You don’t have to be a player – you can also opt to be a coach or an official,” explains Paddy O’Reilly, who, with Gerry McDonnell, supervises the course at Trinity. Also involved is Chris Steele of Celtic Sports Academy. Because of the link with Northern Ireland, Gaelic games are covered by the GSCE curriculum. Schools can pick their own activities – Holy Child Killiney is opting for netball and orienteering.\nDemonstrating the active side of the course was a group of footballers (outdoors) and judo players (indoors). Among the judo instructors was Elanor Gallagher, a student at Trinity Comprehensive.\nFitness training is one of the “sports” that students can decide to adopt and set out in the gym was a circuit training course, which the students had a chance to try out. They then took a break and attempted to complete part of last year’s written exam.\nAt the end of their year’s study, the students have a practical test with an examiner coming in from England. A week later, they sit the written test.\nOverseeing it all last week was Joe Asana from ED Excel, the British-based organisation that supervises the course and accredits schools wishing to include the GCSE in PE in their curriculum.\n“It gives sporty kids a chance to get accredited in something they’re good at and we’re getting increasing interest from Ireland,” he says.\nA second introductory day is taking place at Trinity Comprehensive on December 9.
