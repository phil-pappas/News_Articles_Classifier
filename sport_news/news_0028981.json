(AP) - A University of New Hampshire scientist has developed a new cherry tomato called \"Rambling Rose,\" designed to be grown in hanging baskets in greenhouses.\nThe pink fruit was developed by Becky Sideman, a researcher with the New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station, and collaborators from the University of Vermont and Gordon College.\nRambling Rose originated from self-pollinating a single hybrid Tumbler cherry tomato plant at UNH in 2009. Tumbler was selected as the parent material due to its desirable uniform growth and habit.\nThose interested in seed trials or commercial seed production should contact Maria Emanuel, associate director of UNHInnovation.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:54:10.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
