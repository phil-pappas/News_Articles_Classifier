AP PHOTO Related article » LOS ANGELES – If the Dodgers beat the New York Mets Thursday night in Game 5 of their National League Division Series, they would advance to the NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs beginning Saturday at Dodger Stadium – three days after Clayton Kershaw was outstanding pitching on three days rest.\nBut Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said it was unlikely Kershaw would be asked to make a second consecutive start on short rest.\n“We just kind of planned up to this point and we’ll see where we go from there,” Mattingly said Tuesday night in New York after Kershaw allowed just three hits in seven innings to win Game 4. “I don’t look too far ahead. But we probably wouldn’t go short-rest/short-rest, I wouldn’t think. If we’re able to get the ball back to him (in the next round), that means we’re in a seven-game (series) and I don’t think we would do that.”\nKershaw has started on short rest three times now, once in the NLDS each of the past three post-seasons. The Dodgers have won two of the three games and Kershaw has a 1.89 ERA and 0.74 WHIP in those short-rest starts. According to ESPN Stats & Info, Kershaw’s fastball averaged 94.5 mph during his Game 4 start Tuesday night, his highest fastball average in a start in the past five seasons.\nSo would Mattingly considering using Kershaw in relief in the winner-take-all Game 5 Thursday night?\n“I don’t know. He’ll probably want to but I really haven’t thought of that scenario,” Mattingly said. “But since the Mets might be listening – Yes, he could pitch.”\nThe first two games of the NLCS would start at 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Dodger Stadium – or 8 p.m. ET at Citi Field.\nVAN SLYKE HEALED\nThe wrist problem that led to outfielder Scott Van Slyke being left off the Dodgers’ roster for the NLDs against the Mets has improved and Van Slyke has been taking batting practice again.\nVan Slyke had inflammation in his right wrist during the final week of the regular season and got a cortisone injection in the wrist. He was unable to swing a bat for several days.\nVan Slyke said he is “ready, willing and able” to play if the Dodgers were to advance to the NLCS and add him to the roster. Yasiel Puig made the NLDS roster, essentially in Van Slyke’s spot as a reserve right-handed hitting outfielder. Puig is hitless in six at-bats in the series with three strikeouts.\nROSTER CHURN\nLike shopaholics, the Dodgers’ front office just can’t stop.\nOn the day off between Games 4 and 5 of the NLDs, they claimed right-handed reliever Brooks Brown on waivers from the Colorado Rockies and designated reliever Jim Johnson for assignment.\nJohnson was acquired from the Atlanta Braves at the trade deadline with the hope that he would help solidify the Dodgers’ bullpen. He did nothing of the kind. Johnson was 0-3 with a 10.13 ERA in 23 games for the Dodgers.\nBrown, 30, is 1-4 with a 3.97 ERA in 64 relief appearances for the Rockies over the past two seasons. A first-round pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2006, Brown made the majors for the first time last season and had a 2.77 ERA and a .208 opponents’ batting average in 28 games. He was limited by shoulder problems this season.\nNOTES\nMattingly said catcher Yasmani Grandal is “50-50” to play in Game 5. Grandal’s ongoing shoulder issues have flared up again. The problem affects his swing but not his ability to catch. During the regular season, Grandal started 26 of Game 5 starter Zack Greinke’s 32 starts as well as Game 2 in the NLDS. A.J. Ellis caught just 47 innings from Greinke during the regular season (Grandal caught the other 175 2/3). … Left-hander Hyun-Jin Ryu has begun a throwing program. Ryu had labrum surgery in April.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8iiw-claytonkershawworkoutap.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8iiw-claytonkershawworkoutap.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:25:56.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
