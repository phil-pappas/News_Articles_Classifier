Bryan Lemos and Steven Ruggiero had the assists for their first career points. Just under three minutes later, Mingoia was awarded a penalty shot and the senior cashed in, beating Miami goalie Jay Williams for a 2-1 lead. The Friars increased their lead to, 3-1, 1:42 later when Anthony Florentino scored off assists from Jake Walman and Jankowski. Miami made it a one-goal game 1:35 into the second period on a Colin Sullivan tally but PC extended the lead back to two six minutes later on a Brandon Tanev goal. Jankowski and Mingoia were credited with the assists. Mingoia's second goal of the game, off Jankowski's third helper, made it 5-2 late in the second period.
