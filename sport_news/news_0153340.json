Northern Kentucky football games to watch Enquirer Media sports writers Adam Baum, Rick Broering, Nick Robbe, and Scott Springer look back at last week's games and take a look ahead to this week's matchups. The Enquirer/Glenn Hartong Rick Broering Enquirer contributor 4:16 p.m. EDT October 1, 2015 Buy Photo Bishop Brossart's Craig Pfefferman has thrown for 300 yards and four touchdowns and is one of the team's leading rushers. (Photo: The Community Recorder/James Weber) Buy Photo \nBishop Brossart (5-0) at Ludlow (4-2) \nWHERE/WHEN: 7 p.m. at James Rigney Memorial Stadium, Ludlow \nWHAT TO WATCH: Brossart kept its perfect season alive with a 27-20 win over Nicholas County last week. Ludlow lost a hard-fought game to Williamsburg, 23-14. Both team's offenses are led by a dynamic quarterback and running back duo. For Brossart, seniors Frank Cetrulo and Craig Pfefferman rank first and second on the team respectively in rushing, but they've been even more dangerous in the passing game where Cetrulo has hauled in 20 passes from Pfefferman for 300 yards and four touchdowns. For Ludlow, sophomore quarterback Justin Blackburn is a dual-threat, leading the Panthers with 659 rushing yards and eight TDs to go with 826 passing yards and eight more scores. Senior running back Jeremiah Martin has pitched in with 481 yards and four touchdowns on the ground.

(Photo: The Community Recorder/James Weber) \nNewport (1-4) at Beechw ood (4-1) \nWHERE/WHEN: 7 p.m. at Edgar McNabb Field, Fort Mitchell \nWHAT TO WATCH: Beechwood rolled past Holy Cross, 55-24, last week, while Newport lost at Owen County, 8-6. Beechwood showed how balanced its talented offense can be last week when senior quarterback Kyle Fieger completed 13 of 15 passes for 284 yards and four touchdowns, senior Brett Slusher hauled in eight catches for 151 yards and three scores, and senior running back Ethan Stringer led the Tigers with 177 rushing yards and three touchdowns. Newport's defense only gave up a combined eight points and 276 yards over the last two games, but the Wildcats went 1-1 over that stretch because their offense only mustered 14 points on 469 yards.

Both teams quarterbacks come into this game with a hot hand. Conner dual-threat senior Kyler Padgett leads his team in rushing with 324 yards and seven touchdowns, but his decision-making in the passing game has been even more crucial as he's gone five games without an interception. He had a hand in all three touchdowns the Cougars scored against NewCath â€“ throwing for two and rushing for one. Lloyd sophomore quarterback Jordan Fann had his best game yet by completing 10 of 15 passes for 203 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions last week. This game has the potential for lots of offense with electric playmakers on both sides of the ball.

(Photo: Jim Osborn for the Enquirer) \nBethlehem (4-1) at Holy Cross (2-3) \nWHERE/WHEN: 7:30 p.m. at Tom Ellis Field, Covington \nWHAT TO WATCH: Holy Cross lost its third straight game last week, 55-21, at Beechwood, while Bethlehem shut out Bellevue 23-0. Keep an eye on Holy Cross junior receiver Jaylin Williams. Williams has provided a big spark for the Indians' offense in their last two games, racking up a combined seven catches for 223 yards and four touchdowns. Bethlehem has a run-heavy offense led by junior Hunter Downs with 507 rushing yards and six touchdowns. Downs is also the team's top receiver with 112 yards and another score. The Indians will have to play tougher against the run as they've allowed opponents to rush for an average of 284.4 rushing yards through five games.

(Photo: Jim Owens for the Enquirer) \nGeorge Rogers Clark (0-5) at Ryle (5-0) \nWHERE/WHEN: 7:30 p.m. at Borland Stadium, Union \nWHAT TO WATCH: Ryle rolled over Campbell County, 52-7, last week, while George Rogers Clark lost its fifth straight game to Scott County, 55-21. Three of GRC's losses have come down to one possession. Ryle should be able to overwhelm a struggling Cardinals defense with its loaded arsenal of weapons in the passing game. Last week junior quarterback Tanner Morgan completed 16 of 24 passes for 214 yards and three touchdowns, and no individual receiver caught more than three passes. Seven different Ryle receivers had multiple catches, and 11 Raiders were involved in all. GRC's defense gave up an average of over 200 passing yards per game to its first four opponents. Buy Photo \nJose Torres and his Dixie Heights teammates won their first game of the season against Boone County last week. (Photo: The Community Recorder/James Weber) \nDixie Heights (1-4) at Cooper (4-2) \nWHERE/WHEN: 7:30 p.m. at Jaguar Stadium, Union \nWHAT TO WATCH: Cooper shut out Lexington Catholic, 28-0, last week, while Dixie ended a four-game slide by beating winless Boone County, 35-21. Last week Dixie's defense had three interceptions in the win. Senior Noah Caple, senior Owen Sammons and junior Zachary Borchers all had a pick. The Colonels may need that same type of production on defense this week to help spark their offense against a stingy Cooper defense that's allowed an average of 53 rushing yards per game in the Jaguars' four wins. Watch the Nathan Brown to Dante Hendrix connection for Cooper on offense. Last week the senior quarterback found his junior target eight times for 164 yards and three touchdowns. Buy Photo \nScott's Roberto London follows Ron Rice's blocking, a gameplan that has worked out well for the Eagles this year. (Photo: Jim Osborn for the Enquirer) \nHarrison County (2-4) at Scott (5-1) \nWHERE/WHEN: 7:30 p.m. at Eagle Stadium, Taylor Mill \nWHAT TO WATCH: Scott picked up its second straight win, 43-7, over Mason County last week. Harrison County bounced back from a tough loss at NewCath to beat Holmes, 25-14. Scott has two of the most talented rushers in Northern Kentucky with seniors Roberto London and Deondre Pleasant. Over the last two weeks the duo has ran for a combined 551 yards and six touchdowns. For Harrison County, watch senior receiver and defensive back Jovon Williams. He led the Thorobreds with five catches for 65 yards last week on offense, and he also intercepted two passes and returned one of them 55 yards for a touchdown. \nHalsey Page \nOwen County (2-3) at Walton-Verona (2-4) \nWHERE/WHEN: 7:30 p.m. at Walton-Verona Sports Complex, Verona \nWHAT TO WATCH: Both of these teams had a shaky start to the season but have since recovered. After starting 0-4, Walton-Verona won its second straight game last week, 21-0, over Carroll County. Owen County started 0-3 before stringing a pair of wins together, including last week's 8-6 home victory over Newport. Both of these teams are led by run-heavy offenses featuring multiple backs. Walton-Verona seniors Halsey Page and Noah Richardson have combined for 1,263 yards and nine touchdowns on the season, while Owen County junior Austin Riggs and senior Tristen Hudson have tallied 411 yards and three touchdowns on the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:44:29.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
