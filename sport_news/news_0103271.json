It was just a weird, weird, weird game.\"\nYou could say that again.\nIn a season that has seen its share of high-scoring contests, Olive Branch and DeSoto Central took it to another level, with the Quistors prevailing 87-86 in triple overtime. Records from earlier eras are sketchy, but it's a very safe bet the game is the highest-scoring in DeSoto or Shelby County history.\n\"I've never been part of anything remotely like it before,\" Buckley said. \"And I don't want to again.\"\nSaid Olive Branch's Parker Pulliam, who went the whole game at right tackle, \"I got really exhausted, but you don't even really notice it. I was just like, 'Dang. This is crazy.' I don't know how the guys stuck it out.\"\nAfter a 5-yard touchdown run by OB quarterback Brady Burse and Luis Garcia's 10th extra point of the game gave the Quistors an 87-80 lead, Alan Lamar scored his 10th touchdown of the game for DeSoto Central on a 3-yard run. Jaguars coach Matt Wallace had no hesitation in going for two and the victory, but Olive Branch snuffed out the play.\n\"It was like a heavyweight slugfest with both teams just trading haymakers for 12 rounds,\" said Wallace, who coached on crutches due to a hip problem.\n\"We were gassed. A lot of our players go both ways and we were just absolutely exhausted. It was the right call to make.\n\"I joked with one of the officials that anybody on either team associated with coaching defense should have been fired on the spot. It was a coach's nightmare.\"\nAnd also one for the stat keepers.\nThe biggest night belonged to Lamar. The 5-9, 185-pound senior carried 59 times for 421 yards, scoring on runs of 60, 4, 5, 55, 11, 13, 4, 10 and 3 yards. In addition, he threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Keshuun Abram and brought a punt back 86 yards for a touchdown, finishing with 597 total yards.\n\"And he had an 80-yard punt return called back,\" said Wallace. \"He's the leading rusher in the state of Mississippi, runs a 4.3 (40-yard dash), has a 30 on his ACT and a 4.6 grade-point average but doesn't have a single offer from a Power Five school or from Memphis. Somebody's not doing their job.\"\nOB's Burse also had a huge game, throwing for 354 yards and eight touchdowns — both school records — and running for a ninth. In two weeks, the 6-0, 170-pound senior has rewritten the Quistors record book; he set game records for completions (26) and attempts (41) in last week's loss to South Panola.\n\"Brady's coming along,\" said Buckley. \"Sometimes it takes time with a new system, but he's really improved and recognizing what we're trying to do.\"\nThe teams combined for 59 yards and 1,323 yards. Rewatching the contest will require a significant time investment; there were 243 plays from scrimmage.\n\"There were a couple of times in the huddle where I told the guys 'Hey, we can pull this off. I have faith in us,'\" said Jaguars quarterback Cameron Bowman, whose team trailed 35-15 early, then scored two touchdowns and two 2-point conversions in the final three minutes of regulation just to tie it.\n\"I've been playing with Brady since we were 8 years old and then with the DeSoto Central-Olive Branch rivalry. ... It was just wild. Unbelievable.\"\nFORMER MR. FOOTBALL DIES\nAbe Felix, who won the TSSAA's Mr. Football Award in 2002 after a record-setting career at Houston, has died at the age of 30.\nHis death was announced at Houston's game against Arlington Friday. No other details were available.\n\"He was a one-of-a-kind player,\" said Tim Haney, who coached Felix at Houston. \"And he was a very good person. He was never in any kind of trouble and everybody loved him.\n\"He was the one that really got Houston football over the hump — he was our only Mr. Football — and he got the program to where it is today.\"\nListed at just 5-6 and 172 pounds, Felix led the Shelby-Metro area in rushing in 2001, finishing with 1,788 yards during the regular season. That year, he also set the area record for carries in a season (373) as Houston finished 10-4 and advanced to the state semifinals before losing to Hendersonville.\nThe next year, Felix was named 5A Mr. Football and also won the Pepsi Best of the Preps player of the year award after gaining 1,818 yards and scoring 22 touchdowns. He remains Houston's all-time leading rusher.\nAfter graduating, he was a standout performer at Northeast Mississippi CC before finishing his career at West Georgia.\nDESOTO STARS HONORED\nSeveral DeSoto County football standouts will take part in all-star games at the end of the season.\nDeSoto Central running back Alan Lamar and offensive lineman Dareuan Parker, Olive Branch defensive back Sanchez Blake and Southaven offensive lineman Cordell Birge have been chosen to play in the Mississippi-Alabama all-star game Dec. 12 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.\nThe 6-5, 320-pound Parker has committed to Mississippi State and Blake has committed to the University of Memphis. Lamar, who currently leads in the area in rushing, has offers from 16 schools including Louisiana-Monroe, Navy, Air Force and Yale.\nDeSoto County will also be well-represented at the 67th Bernard Blackwell North-South all-star game, which will be Dec. 9 in Gulfport.\nRepresenting the North will be DeSoto Central quarterback Cameron Bowman and offensive lineman Kendall Terry, Center Hill athlete Dan Ellington, Horn Lake wide receiver Kameron Coleman and Southaven defensive back Devan Hollins and linebacker Daylon Fox.\nDeSoto Central coach Matt Wallace was chosen as an assistant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:27:56.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
