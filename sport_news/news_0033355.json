And he remained brutally honest during his Monday press conference, stressing the immediate aftermath of that showing, along with the remaining seven games, are going to test this players' commitment, leadership and ability to grow while facing a difficult Pac-12 slate in Year 1 of Andersen's rebuilding project.\n\"It's time to sit down, put on our big-boy pants as coaches and as players and look each other in the mirror and make sure that we really want to be in this fight,\" Andersen said. \"I (do). I'm gonna throw those haymakers and (have) seven more weeks of throwing them, and I hope we can find it will be eight more weeks.\n\"I'm gonna keep throwing them, but are those kids really gonna sit there and throw them and do they really want to be here?\"\nAndersen elaborated much more on this topic during his weekly meeting with the media, which also touched on the struggles in all three phases and Saturday's upcoming visit to Washington State. Here are the highlights:\nOn the state of the team following the Arizona loss:\nI always like to try to make sure I reflect the same message to the kids, to you guys (the media) and to the fans — we are where we are because we deserve to be where we are. We have to work to get out of it. We have to grind away. We have to find a way to make sure that football means a ton to all of us as we continue to put in work. We had a long team meeting and talked about it. It was, I think, a good team meeting. It was a very challenging team meeting for myself, for the coaches, for the kids. We are where we are. For this next seven weeks, we're gonna do everything we can to allow these seniors to have some success their senior year. That is the most important thing, and it matters a lot to us. And every day, as we go through, we need to continue to work for those juniors and those sophomores. We need to grind away at it, and we're excited about that opportunity.\nOn what he's learned from previous rebuilding projects as a coach that he can apply this season at OSU:\nFirst of all, I don't really want to be patient, nor do I think I need to be patient with this crew of kids. What I take from the past is I've learned everywhere all the way down the road — there's a lot of coaches that are walking down right now that haven't been down this road, either — I look at them and I try to help them understand, \"Hey, this is real.\" All that you do when you come into a program, you set a foundation and a belief factor for the kids to understand where they're at. I've learned that in the past. It's the best way to do it. Let them understand who you are, what you're about, what your rules are. And it's all fun and games. Go to school, take care of business, get some nice new stuff, get good grades, get a pair of shoes. It's all fun stuff, as long as you just keep your nose clean, and it's easy to do that. Work hard in the offseason, lift, do some things, a couple tug of wars, compete in spring ball, run around. All that stuff's fun. It's great. Kids like that. But now it's real. It's real football. So now it's time to step up and be a man, and it's not that much fun anymore when you get called out and you don't produce in front of your teammates. So that's what I've learned is it's time to sit down, put on our big-boy pants as coaches and as players and look each other in the mirror and make sure that we really want to be in this fight. I (do). I'm gonna throw those haymakers and (have) seven more weeks of throwing them, and I hope we can find it will be eight more weeks. I'm gonna keep throwing them, but are those kids really gonna sit there and throw them and do they really want to be here? That's what I've learned, because that's where we're at. We're at a swinging gate. Where are we going? Go right, go left. Figure out where you want to be. Doesn't mean you have to be an all-conference player, an All-American. But it does mean you have to be all in. And that's just where we're at. That's probably the biggest thing I've learned at this point. But I care for them. I want them to be successful. But we have to be able to be better. Does that mean we still win? I don't know that. If we just do things the right way, it's still a tough league to win. It's a battle every single day. But I'm gonna stay with them. They're working hard. They've got a good attitude. They'll come back. And I've learned that this is a team that, I think, wants it more than the earlier days at a couple other places that I've been as far as listening, wanting to bounce back, not pointing fingers. I'm sure there's some that I don't see — probably more so after today than there's been in the past. But that's OK, because the real warriors will not let that happen.\nOn if he's seen leadership examples from players in the aftermath of the loss:\nThere's definitely maturity taking place. And maturity comes with responsibility, and with responsibility comes maturity, in my opinion. I see it in a few kids. I see it after a few kids want to come and sit down and talk and let (me) know what they feel. And I want the kids to be able to express their concerns, if they have concerns. I want them to be able to understand where we're coming from. The locker room is probably in a good spot, for the most part, right now. But I guarantee you, with where we are and the challenges that are taking place for the young men in this program, there's a lot of decisions that are going to be made. And have to be made. It just has to be that way when we're in the spot that we're in, because we're not producing the way we need to produce. Up-front, honest, truthful with them is the way we've always been. I've asked the leaders to look at them and be honest with themselves, and if they don't think that's right, then come in and sit down and talk about it. No one's come in my office and said \"Man, Coach, I think we're way off-base with where we're sitting and how we're playing. I think we're playing pretty good.\" No one's come in and said any of that stuff. There is some growth. I want to see more, just the little things as we travel the right way. It's always going to hurt coaches more than it hurts most kids. But I want to see it hurt more. When we lose the amount of Pac-12 games that have been lost for a long period of time, there's only one way to change that. And it's with, first, really good players, and that's through getting them better or recruiting. That's through coaches doing their best, and that's being completely invested in a tough, tough, tough league and understanding that probably four or five times during the season, it's gonna to come down to the last play. I took whatever they may say are the four best (Pac-12) teams — which I guess would be Utah, UCLA, Cal and Stanford — and I threw up four or five games that they've had this year and I broke those down to the kids and I let them understand exactly how hard it is to get to whatever those teams' records (are). Shared it with them. Hopefully those little things help. A couple kids came in my office and sat down and said it lets them understand how tough is. So we'll see, but the leadership's getting better. We're still youthful but growing.\nOn how to balance expressing disappointment and accountability with keeping morale positive after the loss:\nYou're gonna be challenged. You're gonna be upset. But we are where we are, and it's a game that we play. I've got a smile on my face. I'm moving around. I'm frustrated. I want to win. But I love the challenge that we're in. And you have to understand, that is what we do. We play to compete. We're trained to battle every single day and do something that not very many people in the world get to do — go out and play on this stage in this conference. We are where we are because we deserve to be where we're at. It's a lot easier to have fun and smile when you're winning, yes. This is a process. Every time we lose a game, it's unexpected, absolutely. But did we expect adversity? Yes. And I think that's important to show that with your kids that the good times are earned, but the bad times can't ruin your life. Then I try to explain to the kids, with the morale side of things, I told them today, I said, \"This is hard times, but only in football.\" It's not life or death. Almost every kid in that room has been through something way more tragic than what we're talking about right now. It's not the end of the world, but it's got to mean a lot to all of us. I've been blessed in my life. I've gone through some tragic things, but not even close to what a lot of those kids in that room have gone through. End of the world? Absolutely not. Does it matter if you just cave in these moments and just go to the next game and say it doesn't matter? Then I think that's a horrible message as a coach to send to a kid for the rest of his life, quite frankly, let alone his football life. We take it hard. We move on. We've moved on to this point. Like I always say, never forget it, but let's go to the next one and work on getting better and be as good as we can and see what happens.\nOn the biggest struggles in the Arizona game:\nThere's a lot of things when you sit back and look at it, things we'll try to fix some of it. If I evaluated the tape overall, it becomes clear that we still need to take advantage of opportunities when opportunity knocks. In this league, that's essential that you are able to do that. We are not in several situations. Our ability to give teams a couple layups per game and big plays on defense is a huge problem right now. Those two long plays that we gave up can be definitely fixed quickly. We've shared that with the kids. We made a teaching tape today. That, I think, is sometimes a valuable way to do things. We reflected back on how we played it in practice and what we did in practice and the exact rep that we played in practice — more than once. Then we didn't execute it in the game. So we shared that with the kids. And that's what you do. You coach them. You teach them. You try to be a better coach and you try to be a better player in those situations. So those are a couple things. We continually work to find the right pieces to the puzzle. As you go through a year, people figure you out. I've said it many times. Good coaches, good players. A couple games, you might get away with this, you might get away with that early in the year. And then pretty soon, they're gonna hone in on who you are, what you're all about, what you can do and, quite frankly, what you can't do and try to take away your best players. That's what we see and that's what we're going to continually see on offense. And they're going to look at those weaknesses that they believe that you have on defense, and they're gonna work like crazy to exploit those weaknesses.\nOn how much stock to put in one game:\nOne particular game, especially early in the season, can (sometimes) not put you in a position that you're truly in, for whatever reason it may be. That happens year in and year out and week in and week out. I think that's why you see a lot of those games that are played early that can flip off and go one way or another, just because of the amount of youth or the it's the first game or whatever it may be. You don't know each other. So some of that is applicable. In this last game, we were definitely overmatched. There's no way to look at it and say anything different. If we do, then I think we're kidding ourselves and we're kidding our kids in the program and everything else ... but the lopsided victories are crazy right now, to really answer your question. It's amazing to see people get beat badly, and then you have to turn around and react. Arizona did it. Arizona came back after a couple big losses and they strapped up their helmets and tied up their cleats and went out and played very well in that football game. That's a sign of a team that has the ability to bounce back with some maturity and has some really good players on it.\nOn any positives taken from the Arizona game:\nThe one place we weren't outmatched was we were not outmatched on the line of scrimmage, which was good to see. It was give and take. It was push and shove. Just because they had all those rushing yards does not mean that we got knocked around on the defensive line. Those defensive linemen, those three kids hung in there. They cracked some big runs with some very good players who were consistent in the running game. I feel the same way about the offensive line. It was a defensive line and an offensive line on both sides, Arizona's and ourselves, that hung in there and battled their tails off, which was a good thing to see ... Two of some of the best effort plays I've seen in a long time was the one that Justin (Strong) made on the big pass, and I believe it was Larry (Scott) on the long run. Those two plays were a couple kids that make tremendous effort plays. I was extremely disappointed in the play of our linebackers, and it's nothing that they haven't been told and that we understand. If you look at Jaswha James, he played at a championship level in that situation. It's hard to swallow sometimes when your kid that played at a championship level gets double-teamed off the line of scrimmage on the big run, and then we're backed up because we don't line up in the right spots as linebackers. I told the kids this, too, I'm a head coach now, but if I'm the defensive line coach, and I know Coach Chad (Kauha'aha'a) feels the same way, that irritates me. That really would drive me nuts, and it should. Jaswha James, I'm sure it does, because we're putting him in a bad spot and we don't have to do that. Those are the things we have to understand. Accept responsibility. Be a tough guy. Play the game. It's hard enough if you don't line up right. Line up right, play it tough and we'll be OK.\nOn the defensive struggles:\nDefensively, we've got to make sure we have the right players in the right spots. There is no magic defense, so you put them out there. They've been challenged mightily. They need to accept that role, or they need to not be involved in the defense. Like I said before, we have the ability to put 70 kids on an airplane. We put 67 on an airplane (for the Arizona game). So if next week, if we have 70, we'll put 70. If we have 65 that I believe and trust (to) compete and play at a high level, then we'll them on that airplane. We won't compromise what we do, what we believe and what we feel. We'll put the best kids out there and let them fight and battle for the spots. That's where we are on defense. They're playing with effort, but they don't, as a whole group, completely understand the responsibility factor of playing big-time, Division I football on the defensive side of the ball. That's where we're at. And that's a lot of youth. It's all the things that you can talk about try to make a case for somebody feeling sorry for you. I'm not interested in any of that garbage. I'm interested in getting these kids better and, quite frankly, challenging them mightily to accept that role.\nOn the offensive struggles:\nThe bottom line is this: In this league, people snap 80 times (and) they're gonna score points. If they snap it 100 (times), they're gonna score more points. You have to score to be able to win, and again, (I) shared with the kids today that fact with the offense. The offense has to score points. You don't get style points. You don't get pretty-play points. You get points when you earn points and you get in the end zone and you put it through the goal posts. We flat-out don't score enough points. There's frustration that comes with not scoring points. There's some good players out there where we're having a hard time getting them the football. And that's the bottom line, fact of the fact. Do we need to run it better and can we run it better? Yeah, I expect us to be able to continue to do that. With Storm (Barrs-Woods) continually feeling better and better and better and the O-line hanging in there, we need to get more production and blocking (with) a few other guys out there. But for us to be able to stay in games offensively and hang in there offensively, we can't just rely on looking to throw the ball to one guy and then take off running. It's not gonna win you a championship. It's not gonna put you in a spot to be able to go to a bowl game. We'll wrap the thing up in six-and-a-half weeks and move onto January if that's the case. My expectation level is for us to be able to throw the ball better, have better play at all positions on the offensive side of the ball and continue to coach them better in those spots. It's never pointing fingers at the kids, but it is the bottom line. We have to be better to create a scheme that allows us to be as effective as we can. It would be nice to get 6 (Victor Bolden), we want to get the ball in that kid's hands. Yeah, Victor wants the ball. Jordan (Villamin) wants the ball. Hunter (Jarmon) wants the ball. We have to be able to throw it to them to give them a chance, and they got to catch it.\nOn if he considered playing backup quarterback Marcus McMaryion in the second half after starter Seth Collins was injured and the score was out of hand:\nI thought about both ways in there. But with Seth being our starting quarterback and giving ourselves the best opportunity to win, it's important that we keep the pedal down as much as we possibly can with this football team and show them that we are going to push hard to win and grind it out and never quit in any way, shape or form. I felt like putting Seth back in there would give us an opportunity for him to grow personally, for the offense to hopefully grow and take some steps forward and to show the team that we're not just gonna go in there and \"Hey, OK, this is over. Let's move onto next week.\" Marcus had his opportunity and we didn't go very far with the offense at that point — not that we did with the other guy in there that much, either.\nOn Washington State coach Mike Leach's style:\nI've never studied him and I've never played him. But from what I hear with the coaches flying back over (following the ESPN \"Car Wash\" this summer) — Coach Leach was on that plane, by the way — it was said many times that all he does is the same thing over and over and over and no one can stop it. From what they've said, I would say it hasn't changed much. It's an interesting, interesting offense that a lot of people have implemented into their programs as they've gone through. I know that Coach (Sonny) Dykes was heavily involved, and that list goes on and on (of coaches) that have been around Coach Leach for a number of years. I don't know if they've taken on the pirate side of him, but they've taken on the offensive side a lot of times.\nOn Washington State's run game:\nI've seen a couple backs that have flashed at me. I've seen that kid (Gerard Wicks) carry piles. He had a couple big plays in that game where he kept going (with) two or three kids on him. It's the read-zone stuff that comes out of there. There's another running back that's in there that does some good things for him. So it's concepts. There's two backs a lot of times in there, where you have some misdirection run plays coming out. And the offensive line is definitely more than just pass blockers, for sure. The run, maybe that's more of a weapon than it's been in the past. But I look at it and say that these guys run the ball as well as throw it. Do they throw it more? Yes. But they are not afraid to run the ball and they also have a very, very wicked screen game that they use at times to cause you issues.\nOn Washington State's defense:\nI can't remember the rushing yards in the last game that Oregon had (410). (Royce) Freeman's as good as I've been around for a long time in this game of college football, and stopping that guy is always tough. That game, to me, was the ultimate Pac-12 game, where it's offenses and defenses trying, really, to get a stop. I didn't have an opportunity to watch it. I hope to watch it maybe tomorrow night and watch it from top to bottom, as far as the TV copy. I obviously watched our film copy. But, hey, Washington State won a big game in a big-time moment. That's against the guys that played for the national championship. They should be really happy about winning that football game, because it's a great team they beat.\nOn playing another road game after a difficult loss away from home:\nI don't really talk about going and playing on the road. I think we've prepared well every single week. We're going to go up to another foreign stadium and have to be able to play and it'll be a different locker room. But like I said, same routine, same situation. When you don't play well, it's the natural tendency to say, \"Well we didn't play well on the road because we were 'this,'\" or \"Gosh, they look tired\" or \"Gosh, they didn't have any emotion.\" Those are all easy things to say when you don't play well. That's the easiest thing for (if) I'm a talk radio guy, so I'm gonna say this or I'm gonna say that. That's simple stuff. It's hard to be able to look and find out why you didn't (play well). I don't see a sign that says, \"Hey, we played better at home because of this or because of that.\" I think we've given it our best swing. If we're gonna win on the road, we've got to do a lot of things better. We've got to play better at this spot and that spot and do these things and coach better and all that stuff. That's where we are.\nOn if he's ever been to Pullman:\nPlayed there a long time ago. Played them a few times at Utah. I played there as a player, but that was so long ago I don't remember anymore. It was '85 or '86. And then we played them one time there, I believe, as a coach, and then we played them at home one time. Don't remember a lot about it, but I'm sure it'll be a good crowd and a nice Pac-12 place and a nice stadium. I've heard they've done some unbelievable things to upgrade their facilities, so I'm looking forward to seeing that.\nOn settling into a more normal routine after odd scheduling during the season's first six weeks:\nYeah, it is nice to settle into it, but then I changed it yesterday. We were settled in to come in on Sunday and have Monday off, but what we ended up doing is taking Sunday off and meeting with the kids this morning. And we can flip that around with whatever we think is best, depending on travel or where we're sitting. But it was different to sit back and say, \"Whoa, tomorrow we could be off or (Monday's) gonna be off, one of the two,\" because the normal weeks have not been this way. I think it's good for the kids. They had yesterday off and now they're off for the rest of the day, off for school and taking care of their business, but hopefully focusing on film. But it's good, I guess, to get back to normalcy, if you will.\"\n-- Gina Mizell | @ginamizell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ginamizell"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:16:37.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
