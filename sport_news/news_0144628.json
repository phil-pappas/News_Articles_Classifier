(AP)\nHonolulu — Kobe Bryant scored five points in his first action since undergoing surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in the Los Angeles Lakers’ 90-71 loss to the Utah Jazz on Sunday.\nBryant was 1-of-5 from the field, with his only made basket coming on a 3-pointer from the left corner. He made both of his free throw attempts.\nDerrick Favors had 16 points and nine rebounds for the Jazz in the preseason opener for both teams.\nBryant played the entire first quarter and sat the rest of the way despite numerous second-half chants of “Kobe! Kobe!” by the sellout crowd of 10,300 at the Stan Sheriff Center. His first shot, a jumper from the corner, hit the side of the backboard.\n“I felt good. It felt good to get out there,” Bryant said. “(My legs) feel strong, I didn’t feel tired at all. It’s just about getting the timing down.”\nLakers forward Julius Randle started and played 21 minutes, finishing with seven points and seven rebounds. Randle, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, broke his right tibia in last year’s season opener and missed the rest of the season.\nD’Angelo Russell, the No. 2 overall pick, started at point guard and finished with five points, three rebounds, two assists, two turnovers and a steal in 21 minutes.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:30:36.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
