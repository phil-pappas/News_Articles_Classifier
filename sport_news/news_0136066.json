And the milestone remained a hot topic of conversation 24 hours later. \n\"I'm not sure if it's my lucky number - that's 11, but it's pretty amazing to get to 700 wins,\" Venus said in her on-court interview afer the match on wednesday. \n\"I'm happy to finally be playing in Wuhan and performing so well here.\" \nHaving already accounted for No.7 Agnieszka Radwanska in the first round, Williams now has six victories over members of the top 10 to her name in 2015 -- her highest tally since 2009. \nShe is likely to face top seed Simona Halep next round if the Romanian can get the better of qualifier Johanna Konta. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:06:55.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
