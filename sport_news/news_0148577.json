Hingle, USA TODAY Sport Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sport Fournette’s in the lead, but TCU quarterback Trevone Boykin isn’t far behind. His push for the Heisman involves highlight-reel moments in the face of dire straits, as seen in the Horned Frogs’ win against Kansas State: Boykin’s 69-yard touchdown run and long scoring pass to wide receiver Josh Doctson allowed TCU to overcome a sizable second-half deficit.\nIt’s Fournette, then Boykin, then everyone else. California quarterback Jared Goff stumbles after his five-interception game against Utah. Georgia running back Nick Chubb is out indefinitely after a knee injury. It’s a two-player race for the Heisman.\n1. LSU RB Leonard Fournette\n2. TCU QB Trevone Boykin\n3. Baylor WR Corey Coleman\n4. Utah RB Devontae Booker\n5.
