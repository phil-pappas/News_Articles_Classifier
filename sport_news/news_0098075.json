Zack Grover was chosen as one of a handful of kids to represent the US in the 2016 student athlete World Games in Austria this Summer. \nZack plays basketball for the Bucks, and AAU basketball in Portland. His coaches wrote letters of recommendation on his behalf, saying Zack was the best person to represent the state overseas because of his hard work and friendly personality. \nZack's friends and family say he looks a lot like Boston Celtics center Kelly Olynyk. Zack says Olynyk is his favorite player, and his inspiration to keep practicing. \nA fundraiser is being held to help Zack with the cost of his trip at the Silver Spur in Mechanic Falls on November 13th.
