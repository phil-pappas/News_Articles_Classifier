The 28-year-old rom Anahim Lake, British Columbia has a 1.00 GAA and a .963 save percentage including his shutout over the New York Rangers Oct.15. It was his 35th career shutout and a great way to start another season of possibly becoming a back-to-back MVP in the league.\nHis 31 saves against the Pittsburgh Penguins helped his team use their offense to beat them 3-2 for their fourth victory of the season. After taking care of the Rangers on opening night at Centre Bell, the Habs went on to tame the Detroit Red Wings 4-1 to end their week with three wins.\nLast season, Price had such a strong season that he was awarded the Hart, Vezina, William M. Jennings Trophies as well as the Ted Lindsay award. While this is the first time the league has given him honors this season, it wont be the last as we have seen just the beginning of what Price can do in the net.", "external_links": ["http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8471679", "http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8475794", "http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8475765"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:20:53.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
