The first Welsh side to qualify for a major tournament since the 1950s \nIt is the first time Wales have qualified for a tournament of note since the 1958 World Cup - and it will be their first ever appearance at the Euros. \nColeman said: \"Wow - I can't explain to you how it feels. Unbelievable. It's been an absolute dream.\" \nGenerations of talented Welsh footballers have famously been denied the opportunity to showcase their skills in international tournaments - but the world's most expensive footballer, Gareth Bale, is now set to feature in France next summer. Gareth Bale could be one of the stars of the tournament \nBale said: \"This is the best loss of my life! We've done it, everyone's very happy. \n\"This is right up there (in my career) - this was one of my dreams of things to do. \n\"Now we've got to go and get things done in France next summer.\" \nWales join England and Northern Ireland in the tournament - and Republic of Ireland could follow on Sunday.
