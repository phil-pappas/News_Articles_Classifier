It’s just a couple of series of bad events happened and I got a little unlucky, and it’s pretty easy to pitch at home when you have the Mets fans.”\nSyndergaard was 7-2 with a 2.46 ERA at home this season and would be a strong candidate for NL Rookie of the Year if he could have carried those numbers to the road. But on the road he was 2-5 with a 4.23 ERA and didn’t show signs of recovery until late in the season.\nThe fact Syndergaard had dominant starts at Atlanta and Cincinnati in the final month convinced manager Terry Collins he would be the right choice for Game 2, regardless of the locale. In those two starts, Syndergaard pitched to a 1.84 ERA.\nIt also didn’t hurt Syndergaard’s case that he pitched a gem at Dodger Stadium on July 3, when he allowed one run over six innings in a no-decision against Clayton Kershaw.\n“The atmosphere here was electric,” said Syndergaard, who has a bit of breathing room, thanks to Jacob deGrom’s masterpiece in the Mets’ 3-1 victory in Game 1 on Friday night. “I can’t imagine what it’s going to be [now].”\nSyndergaard’s development this season had hinged largely on refining his secondary pitches. In addition to a changeup, Syndergaard has come to depend on a two-seam, sinking fastball.\n“One of the things you try to do at this level is try to get easy outs — to get outs early in the count,” manager Terry Collins said. “The two-seamer has allowed him to do that. Now he has a lot more confidence to pitch to contact early in the count, where he doesn’t have to worry about trying to strike somebody out, so it’s been a big help to him.”\nEven so, Syndergaard combined to strike out 21 batters over his final two starts of the regular season. Against the Nationals last Saturday, he allowed one run over seven innings with 10 strikeouts.\nCollins skipped Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom and Matt Harvey for a start apiece in September because of concerns about their workloads, and the manager has been rewarded.\n“[Syndergaard] has gone out and as we saw, pounded the strike zone with quality stuff,” Collins said. “You talk about who the rest has helped maybe the most, I think it may be him. His stuff has been electric since we pushed him back.”\nSyndergaard, who joined the Mets in May after spending a season-plus at Triple-A Las Vegas, has learned a valuable major league lesson.\n“Big league hitters can catch up to the fastball no matter how hard it is,” said Syndergaard, who consistently has thrown his heat in the 97-98 mph range. “So as long as you’re able to change speeds, I feel like I’m going to have success [Saturday] night.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  noah syndergaard", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:41:52.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
