Mancini has a team-high 12 goals for the Mustangs, who are 11-0. \n“Once you give her some space, she’s going to take it and beat you 1-on-1,” Clifton coach Konrad Kruczek said. “And she has an excellent finish. She can finish with both legs.” \nSenior Brittany Morales scored the other goal for Clifton and keeper Carly Egyed recorded a five-save shutout. In the past four games, Egyed has only allowed two goals. Clifton won the county tournament in 2012, but lost in the championship game to Wayne Hills in each of the past two seasons. \nLAKELAND 4, HAWTHORNE 0 (at Wanaque): The third-seeded Lancers scored all four goals in the second half to defeat No. 6 Hawthorne and advance to a semifinal matchup against Clifton next Saturday. Sami Foley scored the go-ahead goal seven minutes into the second half and Madison Burgner chipped in a pair of goals for Lakeland. The rejuvenated Lancers offense has scored a combined 17 goals in its three wins this week. \n“It’s the forward play,” Lakeland coach Rick Capozzi said. “They’ve been moving really well. They’ve been switching fields really well and the midfielders have been able to find the forwards on their runs.” \nLakeland became the first team this season to score four goals against Hawthorne’s stout defense. \nWAYNE HILLS 3, PASSAIC TECH 0 (at Wayne): The first-seeded Patriots kept their dream of a three-peat alive with a shutout over the eighth-seeded Bulldogs. \n“PCTI is a much improved team,” Wayne Hills coach Greg Rehberger said. “They have some quality players there. But we played one of our better games [of the season].” \nOlivia Prusakowski, Gillian Brogna and Deana Abdou scored for Wayne Hills, winners of the past two county championships. \nWayne Hills is looking to become the first team to win the PCT outright in three straight seasons since Wayne Valley won four in a row from 1996-99. \n“We’re very cognizant of the history,” Rehberger said. “And we are tied with Wayne Valley with the most county wins (11) in history.” \nWAYNE VALLEY 3, DePAUL 2 (at Wayne): Imani Thompson saved the Indians with two goals in the second half to help Wayne Valley overcome an early 2-0 deficit. Thompson headed in the game-winner with about seven minutes remaining off a cross from Jen Cannarella. \n“We had a lot of possession and attack and in the end we were finally able to break through after hitting a post in each half and a crossbar in the second half,” first year coach Kathy Sinram said on the win. “Our perseverance was able to get us through.” \nNo. 4 Wayne Valley faces top-seeded Wayne Hills in the semifinals. Wayne Hills beat its crosstown rivals, 2-1, earlier in the season. \nSinram said her team is eager for a chance to play spoiler. \n“I think Wayne Valley respects what Wayne Hills has,” Sinram said. “But in the same token, we’re ready to play with them.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:19:46.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
