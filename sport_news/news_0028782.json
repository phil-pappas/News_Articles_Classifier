The team will continue with its usual pregame preparations Saturday at both the team hotel, and a nearby high school field. \nGarrett, a Princeton grad, was playing for the Giants on 9/11. \n\"It was a significant tragedy in our country's history, and I feel like they captured it so well,\" Garrett said. \"The tragedy of it, and then also the inspirational response that everyone in New York, and in the surrounding areas and in our country to this tragedy. Being there this summer, I think you feel both those things. You feel the tragedy, but you also feel the response and the resiliency of our country, as manifested by that Freedom Tower.\" TALK IS CHEAP, Ep. 28: Sloppy Giants got what they deserved vs. Eagles \nWe knew it was going to be a tough spot for the Giants, but after the ugly 27-7 loss in Philadelphia, some may be wondering: Is this déjà vu all over again?
