At least, that’s what I’ve heard on television. And in school. There are some trends that numbers make it very difficult to argue with, in spite of what conventional wisdom might tell us. \nSECOND-HALF TAR HEELS? \nThis one is sort of true? It’s much truer defensively than offensively for UNC, even as UNC’s defense as a whole has improved tremendously from last season. \nIn 2014, through seven games, North Carolina was allowing 43.9 points per game and 6.51 yards per play. Through seven games this year, the Tar Heels are allowing 16.7 points per game and 4.89 yards per play. \nFirst-year defensive coordinator Gene Chizik has clearly made a huge difference. And what’s even more obvious is that he’s able to make halftime adjustments. There was some concern – understandably so – being expressed over the ease at which Virginia was moving the football on North Carolina in the first half. \nVirginia is not a good offense, and the Cavaliers particularly have issues running the ball usually. They had no such issues in the first half against UNC, running for 6.0 per rush and averaging 6.6 per play, scoring 13 points (and it really should have been more). \nIn the second half, though, North Carolina held Virginia to 4.2 yards per carry and just 3.6 per play, helping force or taking advantage of five Virginia turnovers as well. It’s the second straight week North Carolina’s defense has pitched a second-half shutout in ACC play and overall, the Tar Heels have allowed three ACC opponents to score a total of 10 second-half points (all by Georgia Tech) compared to 48 in the first half. \nIt’s worth pointing out that obviously, Wake and Virginia are no offensive juggernauts, and those were two of North Carolina’s first three ACC opponents. It’s more to point out the difference between first and second half because the adjustments are worth noticing/appreciating, even if two of their ACC wins have come against bad offenses. \nIf the Tar Heels play a team that can make them pay more for first-half defensive miscues – like, oh, I don’t know, Pittsburgh this Thursday – it could be an issue. Right now, though, the Tar Heels aren’t going to complain about 3-0 in the ACC as of right now, nor should they. \nThe numbers also challenged my thought process from watching these games that UNC’s offense started slowly, too. Now, they’ve turned it over a bit too much in the first half – all four of their turnovers in ACC play – but they’re averaging 8.5 yards per play and have scored 56 points compared to 58 in the second half (but 6.8 yards per play). They’re a bit less boom-or-bust and more steady in the second half, but still. Not a huge difference. The defense is the difference. \nWho ever thought we’d say that about North Carolina’s defense? The tougher offenses are coming, of course, but it’s impressive. \nFIRST-QUARTER WOLFPACK? \nThat was definitely my impression from having watched NC State’s ACC games this year. There’s some truth to it, but it’s not completely accurate. Every game has definitely been its own entity for NC State. NC State’s ACC games definitely have seen a drop-off from Quarter 1 production to the rest of the game (NC State averaged 12.2 yards per play in the first quarter of its last two games combined compared to 3.1 in Quarters 2-4; overall in league play its 10.9 per play in the first quarter and 3.1 in the final three). NC State’s offense has put up just 31 points in three ACC games spite of the good first-quarter numbers, and 28 of them came yesterday. Ultimately that was the biggest difference for NC State as they were able to make big plays (um, understatement) and make their opponent pay for any and all mistakes. \nThis is the crazy part, though: NC State has allowed just seven first-quarter points and allowed just 3.3 yards per play (just 1.8 in its last two games in the first), but then allowed 58 points in quarters 2-4, including 45 in the last two games combined (and 5.5 per play in the last two). Ultimately, though, it doesn’t matter if NC State can put points on the board and that’s what it did against Wake Forest. \nNC State’s coaching staff deserves credit for the way its team has started out the first three ACC games. They clearly have scouted out opponents well and scripted plays on both sides of the ball that put their players in the best position to succeed. Finally against Wake Forest, they were able to turn their solid early play into points, which had to help this young team get the confidence it needed to cruise to a win. \nATLANTIC ANARCHY VS. COASTAL CLUSTER \nAtlantic Division honks sometimes don’t sound all that different than a lot of SEC honks – clinging to the coattails of its top teams desperately as they tweet dismissively about another league (the ACC, the Coastal Division), hoping no one notices the Vanderbilt log in their Twitter avatar – or, in this case, the rest of the Atlantic Division beyond Clemson and FSU. \nWell, this year, the rest of the Division is noticeable. Boston College’s defense is legit, Louisville is better than their record and NC State is a solid team. But Wake Forest is still not good enough to compete every week in the ACC, Boston College can’t score (like, at all) and has yet to beat a Power 5 team and Syracuse looks to be bad. Again. \nThat would essentially put three of the league’s four worst teams (Boston College, Syracuse, Wake Forest) in the Atlantic Division. So while the frustration of Atlantic Division fans is understandable – you essentially have two guaranteed losses on your schedule each year because of Clemson and FSU – it’s somewhat balanced out, at least this year, by having easier games against the bottom half of your division. \nVirginia is the only team that can make a claim in the Coastal to being in that bottom group when it comes to the whole ACC. Week in and week out, Coastal teams are more often than not playing a team that is capable of beating them – and a team that they’re capable of beating, on the flip side, which has its own benefits. Is there a great team in the Coastal? A guaranteed loss, if you will? Not usually, but one could argue that the Atlantic has had much weaker teams at the bottom in recent years than the Coastal. And it definitely does this year. \nOn Saturday night, the last place team in the Coastal – one that was better than its record in Georgia Tech – knocked off Florida State, giving the Seminoles their first ACC loss since 2012. So maybe it’s time to retire the easy and lazy idea that the Coastal is somehow significantly easier than the Atlantic. It was probably already time. \nThe Coastal is 6-3 against the Atlantic this year, and all three losses were to either Clemson or Florida State (not to mention the only win over FSU by anyone). That’s not a new trend: the Coastal is 27-12 since/including the 2012 season against teams not named FSU or Clemson from the Atlantic. Virginia has three of those losses, and Virginia Tech – in spite of having relatively easy crossovers – has four. North Carolina is 5-2 versus the rest of the Atlantic and has squandered chances in years where it has not faced FSU and Clemson, dropping games to Wake Forest and NC State in the last three seasons. Duke, Georgia Tech and Pitt (albeit with a smaller sample size) are all undefeated since 2012 against the Atlantic’s “other” teams. \nLet’s use NC State as an example – not to pick on the Wolfpack, but I know some NC State fans wonder how much better their ACC record might be in the Coastal. Well, NC State is 1-7 in its last eight games against the Coastal and 6-7 against Atlantic teams not named Florida State and Clemson in that same span. (Four of those losses came in Dave Doeren’s first year when the Wolfpack went winless in ACC play, as did two of the Coastal losses, for the sake of providing the full picture.) \nThe last time NC State arguably wasn’t rebuilding – back in 2012 ,Tom O’Brien’s final season – the Wolfpack went 4-1 against the Atlantic (including beating FSU) back in 2012 but was 0-3 against the Coastal, including getting blown out at home by an awful Virginia team. \nNC State has already lost to a middling Virginia Tech team this year – a winnable game out of the Division for a steadily-improving Wolfpack team. If the Atlantic is better, than an average-to-bad Coastal team shouldn’t be a problem, even on the road. It’ll never be easy, but it’s a game NC State could and arguably should have won. (I would have said the same thing about Duke, by the way, had the Blue Devils not escaped in overtime on Saturday.) \nClemson and Florida State are a combined 16-2 against the Coastal and 30-1 versus the rest of the Atlantic since/including 2012. The rest of the current teams in the Atlantic Division have a combined seven wins over the Coastal since 2012 and three were by Wake Forest (thank you for that special 6-3 OT win over Virginia Tech, Deacs). So NC State is not the only non-FSU/Clemson Atlantic team who can’t manage to get over on Coastal opponents – far from it. \nWould NC State have as good a chance as anyone to win the Coastal if it were in it? Probably so, but that’s because that’s how the Coastal shakes out year by year anyway – it feels like everyone has a chance (except Virginia), even if the same 2-3 teams actually end up winning it. And obviously NC State’s record against the Coastal in recent years wouldn’t indicate that they’re a Division change away. \nIf you’re talking about winning the Division being tougher in the Atlantic than the Coastal, I absolutely agree with that. There’s little to no margin for error, and you almost certainly will have to beat either Clemson or FSU. But when you start comparing the Divisions side by side and saying one is overall tougher than the other and look at their respective depth? I’m just not seeing it.
