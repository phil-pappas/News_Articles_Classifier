Their asylum case is expected be heard on December 11. \n\"The decision shows that the rule of law in Botswana is on solid ground and we are happy to be beneficiaries of it,” Abane Ghebremestel of Eritrean Movement for Democracy and Human Rights in Pretoria, said. \nSimilar mass defections by Eritrean soccer players occurred in Kenya in 2009, Tanzania in 2011 and Uganda in 2012. They were fleeing a country where slavery-like practices are routine and torture widespread, the United Nations said after a year-long investigation. \nThe U.N. investigation also found that Eritrea subjected its citizens to indefinite national service and killed people who try to flee the country. The Eritrean Foreign Ministry dismissed the report without addressing specific allegations. \n(Writing by Tiisetso Motsoeneng.
