It is a major reason the Dublin Jerome senior committed to play tennis at Utah State next fall.\nWhen Bullock takes the court in the Division I state tournament Friday and Saturday at the Lindner Family Tennis Center in Mason, she would like to attain that same level of nirvana. But conquering the head games associated with her 24-0 record may be Bullock’s top challenge.\nShe entered as a favorite a year ago with a 22-2 record but bowed out in the second round.\n“Although I was hoping to do a little better last year, I’m not going to make any excuses because my opponent just played better than me,” Bullock said. “Even so, I’m going in with a different outlook this year. I’ve had a great senior year and a great career, and I feel like it’s all for fun now. I just want to go out and relax and play my best and whatever happens, happens.”\nJerome coach Tyler Stephen had predicted that Bullock would challenge for the title a year ago and regrets doing so.\n“There was just a little too much pressure on her last year,” he said. “No matter how many tournaments you’ve played in, going in as a favorite at the state is not easy for a high-school girl to handle. … I’ve emphasized to her that if she plays like she’s capable of playing, she can play with anybody. That should be her mindset.\n“But she’s got nothing to prove. She shouldn’t feel any extra pressure to atone for anything.”\nBullock hasn’t dropped a set all season. The only opponent to win more than three games in a set was Claire Ghidotti of Watterson, who pushed her to 7-5, 6-4 in a district semifinal.\nBullock is considered among the favorites in a group that includes Alexa Abele of Cincinnati Sycamore, Molly Sandberg of Hudson and Emily Thomas of Cincinnati Princeton. Sandberg was runner-up a year ago, and Abele placed third after her three-set, second-round upset of Bullock.\nIf this year’s bracket holds form, Bullock would again face Abele (24-2) in the second round.\nBullock will return Sunday to help Dublin Jerome try to defend its Ohio Tennis Coaches Association title at Reynoldsburg.\nAt Mason, central Ohio will be represented by four singles players and four doubles teams in Division I and two singles players and three doubles teams in Division II.\nThe area has dominated Division I doubles in recent years, capturing four straight titles and five of the past six. Upper Arlington’s Kyra Jung, who teamed with Audrey Berger to win the state title a year ago, returns with a new partner in Anna Marie Reynolds. Another UA duo, sisters Olivia and Paige Kompa, won the district title.\nIn Division II, the top area threat in singles is district champion Marissa Madison of Columbus School for Girls. But the field includes defending champion Lauren Gillinov of Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown and runner-up Olivia Rohrbacher of Sandusky Perkins.\nSisters Makela and Lexis Hughes of Columbus Academy comprise the area’s top doubles team.\n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BlackiePreps"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:41:39.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
