He had completed his chemotherapy in late September and had undergone scheduled post-treatment testing at Massachusetts General Hospital on Wednesday. Farrell was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's Burkitt lymphoma on Aug. 10 and took a leave of absence from the team on Aug. 14. It's expected that he'll still require much of the offseason to recover fully enough to handle the rigors of managing the Red Sox. Team president Dave Dombrowski announced just before the end of the season that Farrell would return as manager next season, health permitting. Bench coach and longtime Farrell friend Torey Lovullo took over as interim manager for the rest of the reason and will return as bench coach next season, giving up the chance to interview for managerial jobs to provide insurance should Farrell not be back to 100 percent by next spring. \"I am extremely thankful for the outpouring of support I have received from the Red Sox, my family, friends, and fans throughout this process,\" Farrell said in a statement. \"I am also especially thankful for the talented doctors who cared for me in Detroit and here at MGH.\" Dodgers, Mattingly agree to part ways LOS ANGELES — Don Mattingly and the Los Angeles Dodgers stuck to their scripts Thursday, insisting they agreed to a mutual parting of the ways while never revealing the exact reason he won't return as manager. Like a publicist announcing the demise of a Hollywood marriage, the parties insisted the split was amicable. Mattingly even suggested he \"will be friends like forever\" with his former bosses. \"I don't really want to get into details of our conversations. They were good conversations, they were open and they were honest,\" Mattingly said by phone from his offseason home in Evansville, Indiana. \"It just became evident that this was the best thing for both parties.\" Coe-Brown boys win JV state title NORTHWOOD — The host Coe-Brown boys won the Division II/III JV cross country state title on Thursday, scoring 25 points to edge Oyster River (30).

Pitino on website: 'I will not resign' LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Louisville coach Rick Pitino vows to Cardinals fans that he \"will not resign and let you down\" as investigations continue into an escort's book allegations that one of his former staffers hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players. In a season preview Thursday on his website, the Hall of Fame coach apologized to fans for having to \"endure the pain\" of allegations by Katina Powell that Andre McGee paid strippers to perform 22 shows from 2010-14 at the players' dormitory. The 63-year-old Pitino has denied knowledge of the activities described in Powell's book and said Thursday, \"someday I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years but that time is not now. I do not fight these accusations by others but rather turn the other cheek.\" Muhammad Ali tweeted his support for the school from the boxing great's personal and fan Twitter accounts Thursday evening, saying, \"From one champion to another, I will always stand behind and support UofL. GoCards! (hash)UniteLouisville.\" Pitino's latest comments come two days after Powell broke her silence after the release earlier this month of \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen.\" Powell told ESPN's \"Outside The Lines\" program that she had no proof the coach knew McGee paid her $10,000 to arrange the shows that took place in the players' Billy Minardi Hall dorm. seacoastonline.com Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 11:54 PM Updated at 11:55 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:34:04.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
