(AP) - Once Aaron Rodgers and Co. warmed up in the second half, the Green Bay Packers kept their unbeaten start rolling.\nRodgers passed for 224 yards and a touchdown, ran 17 yards to set up a key second-half score, and the Packers beat the hapless San Francisco 49ers 17-3 on Sunday for their first 4-0 start in four years.\nRichard Rodgers caught a 9-yard touchdown pass on the game's opening drive before Rodgers got his team going in the second half after a slow start to snap a four-game losing streak to San Francisco, which included a pair of playoff defeats.\nClay Matthews added his own flair to this one. When he sacked Colin Kaepernick in the third quarter, he kissed his right biceps Kaepernick-style to punctuate the play - one of Green Bay's six sacks.\nWhile methodical with nothing fancy, Green Bay (4-0) seemed unfazed with a short week and long trip West after beating Kansas City last Monday night. This is the team's first 4-0 start since winning the initial 13 games in 2011.\nThe Packers certainly hope their trip to Levi's Stadium will be the first of two this season. The Super Bowl comes to the second-year, $1.3 billion Bay Area venue in four months for its 50th year celebration.\nKaepernick threw his fifth interception in two games and the 49ers (1-3) have been limited to 28 total points over three games while giving up 107 points. The quarterback, sacked six times, was booed in the fourth quarter along with rookie punter Bradley Pinion.\nThe Packers capitalized shortly after San Francisco's Reggie Bush was stuffed for no gain trying to go up the middle on third-and-11 in a play call that was immediately scrutinized.\nOn the ensuing drive, James Jones caught a 38-yard pass on the left sideline by barely staying in bounds. Rodgers then scrambled 17 yards to set up John Kuhn's 1-yard scoring burst.\nGreen Bay made just enough plays. The Packers sacked Kaepernick on consecutive snaps late in the first half, and the Niners settled for Phil Dawson's 33-yard field goal in their best scoring opportunity of the day.\nJones wound up with five receptions for 98 yards in the fifth meeting between the rivals since 2012, while Randall Cobb had his streak of seven games with either a touchdown or 100-plus yards receiving snapped. Eddie Lacy ran for 90 yards and converted two fourth downs.\nOn one particular 49ers mishap, Australian rookie returner Jarryd Hayne was trying to catch a punt on the sideline when he was run into by two teammates, first L.J. McCray and then Jaquiski Tartt, and the ball bounced off the pile of 49ers before teammate Dontae Johnson recovered.\nAll of this on a day home run king Barry Bonds and the NBA champion Golden State Warriors were in attendance.\nGreen Bay played on the road after a Monday night game for just fifth time since 2006, improving to 4-1 in those games. The Packers also improved to 10-2 during the regular season in California since 1990.\nKaepernick, who had played some of his best games against the Packers, was 13 for 25 for 160 yards and a 55.4 passer rating.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
