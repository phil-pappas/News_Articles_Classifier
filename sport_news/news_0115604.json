He left the opening game of the season after trying to helicopter into the endzone.

And, in his defense, he probably slipped on the part of the field that wasn't covered. Also, thankfully, he came away unscathed, meaning it's kind of OK to laugh.", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/eVLUYUr11jx/embed/simple", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:59:59.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
