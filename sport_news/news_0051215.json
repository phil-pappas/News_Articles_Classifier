Lindsay Whalen limped off the floor with a badly sprained ankle. Maya Moore couldn’t hit a shot. \nThe third championship for the Minnesota Lynx was by far their most difficult. \nWith a suffocating defense and a yearning to celebrate in front of their loyal fans, the Lynx turned a tense WNBA Finals into a runaway. \nSylvia Fowles had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and the Lynx captured their third title in five years with a 69-52 victory over the Indiana Fever in Game 5 on Wednesday. \nAugustus added 16 points and Rebekkah Brunson grabbed 14 rebounds for the Lynx, who also won it all in 2011 and 2013. Moore scored just five points on 1-for-8 shooting, but the Lynx forced 21 turnovers and held Indiana to 35.7 percent shooting in the league’s first Game 5 since 2009. \nTamika Catchings had 18 points for the Fever, who were looking for their second championship. \nStar guard Briann January scored six points in the first quarter for Indiana, but didn’t score again until six minutes were gone in the third. She finished with 13 points on 6-for-15 shooting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:55:49.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
