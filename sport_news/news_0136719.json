The Mustangs won five straight matches after losing against Deerfield, but they are looking to increase their scoring output. By JASON ROSSI - jrossi@shawmedia.com \nBERWYN – Adan Carriedo says there is a lot of room for improvement for Morton’s boys soccer team to make. \nIt’s not so much a criticism as a desire to raise expectations and the level of play as the Mustangs approach the postseason. \n“Lately I wouldn’t say we’re playing bad, but our finishing has been terrible,” Carriedo said. “We push up as a team and when it’s time to finish we have a little bit of trouble and that’s what comes back to bite us.” \nThe Mustangs rode a five-game winning streak into a showdown against Kennedy on Oct. 5, but they scored just two goals in four of those matches, including a 2-1 overtime win against Fenwick. It’s a frustrating change of circumstances for a team that routinely was scoring four or five goals a game earlier in the season. \n“That’s pretty much what it is, we dominate possession and we can’t finish in the final third, and until we can focus on the final third we’ll continue to out-possess people 80-20 or 90-10 in the game,” Morton coach Mike Caruso said. “We just have to focus better in the final third. \n“We’re getting the ball to the end line and serving it in. We’re just not getting on the end of it.” \nPart of the downturn in scoring output was the level of competition in the PepsiCo Showdown tournament, which Morton followed with a tough West Suburban Gold conference game against Downers Grove South. \n“These guys are pretty smooth [with the ball], and if it frustrates me eventually it’s going to frustrate them not being able to put the ball in the net,” Caruso said. “We’re treading a fine line where any little thing can be the difference.” \nThe Mustangs have time to work out the kinks. Starting with the Kennedy game Oct. 5, they are scheduled to play six games in nine days before the playoffs start Oct. 20. \n“I think we just need to work on communicating,” Carriedo said. “Once we’re in the box, just communicate. Whether it’s passing or shooting, we have to get the ball in the net.” \nDan Santaromita contributed to this report. \n– \nWho: Hinsdale South at Morton \nWhat: West Suburban Gold boys soccer \nWhen: 4:30 p.m. Oct. 8 \nWhere: 2400 Home Ave., Berwyn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:05:57.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
