The man from French Camp wore a helmet with a flashing light on it with a Stockton Heat sticker on it, and a Thunder sweatshirt. It was a perfect hybrid outfit for a fan base that is quickly embracing the Heat of the AHL and still fond of their Thunder memories. Pagala was part of an estimated crowd of more than 300 who attended Sunday’s Fan Fest for the Heat at Stockton Arena. Fans met with players to chat and get autographs, engaged in a question-and-answer session with coach Ryan Huska and Calgary Flames assistant general manager Brad Pascall, and took tours of the newly renovated locker room. For lifetime hockey fans such as Pagala, the best thing about the Fan Fest is that it’s an indication the beginning of the season is close. “It’s great and exciting,” said Pagala, a French Camp resident who obtained the autograph of every available Heat player on his white helmet. “I can’t wait until the season starts.” The Heat starts the 2015-16 season when it hosts the Rockford Ice Hogs 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Stockton Arena. Pascall stood near the front door at one point and watched the people enter the arena. ‘This is a great turnout,” said Pascall, who handles the day-to-day hockey operations for the Heat. “There’s a lot of enthusiasm.” It was also a big day for the Heat players. Defenseman Aaron Johnson said he enjoys these types of events. “It’s a good time,” Johnson said. “It’s great for the players to get a chance to meet the fans, and for the fans to put a name to the face. It’s always tougher when you get the helmets on, so it’s nice to get out there and meet them.” The most popular spot on the tour of the locker room was the cubicle of Garet Hunt, the longtime Thunder fan favorite who is trying to make the Heat’s roster as a tryout player. People posed in front of his locker and took selfies or photos of friends and family. “He’s worked so hard for our team for so long, and we’ve been following his career,” Pagala said. Other fans were anxious to get a chance to see a Triple-A team whose players are just a step away from the NHL. “You can see guys progress on their way to the NHL,” said Monica Sousa of Santa Rosa. “I’m pretty excited about it.” One question that has been asked frequently has been when the Heat’s mascot will debut. The identity remains a secret, but team President Dave Piecuch said the plan is to reveal the mascot opening night. The Calgary Flames of the NHL, who own the Heat, announced Sunday they had acquired center Freddie Hamilton from the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for a conditional seventh round pick in the 2016 NHL Draft. Hamilton will be assigned to Stockton.   @ScottLinesburgh.
