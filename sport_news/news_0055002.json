That might be short-term compensation of the reduced grid pattern, but it may also contribute to the development of Alzheimer's dementia in the long term, according to the researchers.\n\"Our studies may contribute to a better understanding of early changes of Alzheimer's dementia,\" said Axmacher.\n\"Now, it has to be verified if such changes also occur in older people at an early stage of Alzheimer's dementia and if they can be affected by the application of drugs,\" said Axmacher.\nThe study was published in the journal Science. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:10:36.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
