The Roma midfielder picked up a pass from Jordan Lukaku outside the box and let fly, with his effort taking a wicked deflection off Marc Rebes on its way in.\nMarcio Vieira fired a tame free kick straight at Simon Mignolet for the hosts, while De Bruyne could only clip the outside of the post from close range after being cleverly slipped through by Hazard.\nBut the Manchester City star found his range superbly moments later. After Hazard had won a free kick 25 yards from goal, De Bruyne dispatched a perfect effort in off the post.\nAndorra made a stunning impact five minutes into the second half, with Victor Moreira drawing a reckless foul by Jan Vertonghen in the box and Lima sending Mignolet the wrong way from the spot for his 10th international goal.\nBut the hosts shot themselves in the foot almost immediately when captain Oscar Sonejee foolishly jumped up to handle Mertens' corner. Hazard calmly rolled home the spot kick - his fifth goal in seven internationals.\nIt was four for the visitors on 64 minutes. Mertens raced down the right and whipped in a perfect cross for Depoitre, who applied the finishing touch to mark his international debut with a goal.\nAnother handball in the penalty area - this time from Gabriel Riera as he attempted to block Vertonghen's header - gave Hazard another opportunity from the spot, but this time Pol got down to save what was a poor effort from the Chelsea man.\nThat was not enough to break Belgian spirits, though, as the team celebrated booking its ticket to France with its large traveling support after the final whistle.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:57:09.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
