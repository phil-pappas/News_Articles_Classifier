It was agreed to in 2012 and now we’re halfway through that agreement they’re looking to change that.\n“I am not sure if you’ll find anywhere else in the world an employer asking one group of employees to pay for another group of employees.”\nUNFAIR: Women earn nothing from $70m windfall\nAustralia’s female cricketers are asking for an equitable cut of the earnings. Source: Getty Images\nCA is paying its female contracted players a total of $2.26 million, which it wants the ACA to take on from the players’ pool. If CA continues to pay out of its own funds, all of which is put back into the game, then it’s understood several development officers and coaches would need to be made redundant.\nNegotiations between CA and the ACA will begin in coming weeks for the new CBA to start from 2017, and under the circumstances it will be tense at best.\nWACA CEO Christina Matthews, believes male players would be willing to part with some of their player pool cash.\n“It would be interesting to know if the players who are playing now, if asked whether they’d be happy to give up $2 million of that $70 million to give the women a great increase, would support it — I would be very surprised if most didn’t,” Matthews said.\n“I understand the ACA’s point of view, they’re going into negotiations and they don’t want payments that have already been agreed to be decreased.\n“But I’m sure that in this instance an arrangement could be made for a one-off payment, on the understanding that it all starts with a new platform for an MOU if the parties can agree this is not a precedent.”\nBut the female players are not universally demanding the men dip into their own pockets.\nSpin bowler Erin Osborne said while she’d love to cash in on some of the $70 million, she’d prefer not to do so at the expense of her male counterparts.\n“I see where the men are coming from, they shouldn’t be responsible for funding our wages,” she said.\n CA: Guys have to give up a chunk", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/17/1227572/744152-6b753e5c-74a1-11e5-9c0a-ce1ed3f9b0e3.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-australia-to-demand-male-players-split-payments-with-females-in-next-cba/story-fni2fnmo-1227572744179"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:44:32.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
