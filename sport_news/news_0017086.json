(AP) - More boat ramps on the Ross Barnett Reservoir have been closed because of low water conditions caused by drought.\nReservoir officials announced the closure of seven more ramps Friday, bringing the total number to 10. On Friday, the water level of the 33,000-acre lake was slightly over two feet below normal.\nThe Clarion-Ledger reports ( http://on.thec-l.com/1Lf0Pw1 ) the most recent closures include ramps at the Campgrounds of Goshen Springs, Lake Harbor Road, Harbor Lane, the Madison County side below the Spillway and Glen Cove, Bay Park and Harbor View ramps in Pelahatchie Bay.\nFannin Landing, Brown's Landing and Twin Harbor were closed over a week ago.\nReservoir officials warn boaters to use caution with launching, returning, and driving across the lake as low water has brought obstacles closer to the surface.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
