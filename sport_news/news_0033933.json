(AP Photo/L.G. Patterson) slideshow \nGAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) â€” Florida quarterback Will Grier was suspended indefinitely for violating the NCAA's policy on banned drugs, a person familiar with the situation said Monday. \nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the school has not announced the decision. Grier is considering an appeal. \nThe eighth-ranked Gators (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) have a news conference Monday afternoon and are expected to announce Grier's suspension. \nGrier, a freshman, has started the last five games for the Gators and would have started Saturday at No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0). Sophomore Treon Harris is expected to start in his place. \nGrier is the first Florida quarterback to pass for more than 200 yards in three consecutive games since Tim Tebow in 2009. Grier has completed 65.8 percent of his passes for 1,204 yards, with 10 touchdowns and three interceptions. \nThe NCAA does not regulate the use of recreational drugs during the regular season, only during championship events and bowl games. It does, however, have rules banning the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The suspension could cost Grier as much as all of this season and half of next. \nGrier and the Gators have been one of the most surprising teams in the country under first-year coach Jim McElwain. The Gators already have matched last year's regular-season win total and have a commanding lead in the SEC East race. \nHarris started Florida's opener against New Mexico State, and he and Grier split the snaps in the second week against East Carolina. He has not thrown a pass since. He is 19 for 27 for 269 yards and two touchdowns. \nHe played nine games as a freshman last season, completing 45 percent of his passes for 1,019 yards, nine touchdowns and four interceptions.
