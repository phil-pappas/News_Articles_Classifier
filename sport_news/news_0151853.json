Kings want to manage the goaltender's weight this year. How will the Los Angeles Kings attempt to keep Jonathan Quick in top form all season long? The answer, as reported by LA Kings Insider , might be by controlling Quick’s weight.\nAdChoices Bill Ranford, the goaltending coach for the LA Kings, was asked about Quick’s weight and how a fluctuation might impact the goaltender’s mechanics. Ranford’s answer revealed that Quick’s weight will be closely monitored this season.\n“We really want to control his weight, and as the season goes on, his weight tends to climb a little bit and it’s more about just maintaining it this year and keeping an eye on it. A lot of it has to do with diet – once you get on the road and making sure that you’re eating smart.”\nThe weight monitoring is an effort to keep Quick healthy as opposed to improving his play. When he likely added a few pounds as the year wore on, his play actually improved. Last season, Quick was actually better following the All-Star Game (1.96 GAA, .925 SV%) than he was prior to the break (2.47 GAA, .912 SV%). That point aside, the Kings will lean heavily on Quick and that means they’ll do whatever it takes to keep him on the ice.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://lakingsinsider.com/2015/09/30/ranford-shares-a-preseason-goalie-evaluation/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:32:57.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
