The first quarter produced zero points for either team and a pair of turnovers. After beginning the third quarter down 15-13, Metamora began to pull away en route to a 25-22 Mid-Illini Conference nail-biter over Pekin. A victory would have nearly secured an at-large playoff bid for Pekin (4-4, 3-3). The Dragons have one more game, home against Limestone next week, to reach the coveted five-win plateau. The Dragons made it interesting late in the fourth quarter with a touchdown from quarterback Nick Campbell to Sebastian Fuller with 1:43 left in the game. The Redbirds recovered the ensuing onside kick. The recovery lead to a first down and the victory formation securing the victory for Metamora (6-2, 4-2). Pekin’s nearly scored earlier in the fourth quarter before getting stopped by the Metamora defense. The Dragons marched down to the Metamora 11-yard line before getting stopped on fourth down. The Dragons missed the first down by only a few chain links. Pekin received the ball to begin the second half before going three-and-out on the ensuing possession. The Redbirds capitalized on a 49-yard run by backup quarterback John Brunton on the second play of the half for Metamora at the 10:33 mark in the third. The Redbirds went for two but the pass by Brunton was no good. Metamora took its first lead of the game at 19-15. The Dragons failed to answer on their following possession going three-and-out again. Pekin could only muster a 15-yard punt, setting the Redbirds up in prime territory on Pekin’s 42-yard line. Brock Modglin extended the lead for Metamora with 8:40 left in the third with a 42-yard scamper to the end zone. The Redbirds did not convert their extra point; however, they extended their lead to 25-15 at the end of the third quarter. Pekin’s defense stopped Metamora on their first drive before punt returner Julian Hill fumbled the punt, giving the ball back to the Redbirds. Hill quickly made up for his gaffe on the next drive of the game by intercepting Brunton, who is filling in for starter Jacob Mitchell who missed the game for an undisclosed reason. Later in the quarter, Hill was injured during the a running play of which he hit the ground hard. He did not return to the game. Pekin opened the second quarter with a touchdown on a 1-yard quarterback sneak by Campbell with 11:29 left to go in the second quarter. The Dragons lined up to kick the extra point, however a low snap to holder/backup quarterback Mason Carr ended up working in the Dragons favor. On the low snap, Carr rolled right and found Connor Eubanks in the corner of the end zone for the two-point conversion making it 8-0 in Pekin’s favor. The Redbirds answered back as a part of four straight possessions leading to a touchdown for the two teams. Brunton found Garret Dominay on a 44-yard touchdown strike with 8:03 left in the second quarter. The ensuing extra point was good, cutting the Dragon lead to 8-7. Relentlessly, Pekin answered back. Campbell found the end zone, again, this time on a 38-yard scramble with 4:39 left to go in the half. Kicker Shea Goessman converted the extra point extending Pekin’s lead to 15-7. Again, Brunton aired the football down the field to Brant Welborn with 1:33 left to play in the half, keeping Metamora close. In an attempt to tie the game going into halftime, Metamora went for the two-point conversion on a designed quarterback run but the Dragons stuffed the Redbirds to keep their lead. Pekin led for the entire first half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:45:19.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
