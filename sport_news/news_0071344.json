Third St., Cannon Beach, closed earlier this month so construction could begin on a new brewery, according to a press release.\nPublic Coast Brewing Company, set to open next spring, will produce seven house beers from a 10-barrel brewing system, according to the release. Portland Brewing Company co-founder Fred Bowman is collaborating on the project.\nThe Lumberyard was purchased in 2004 by Ryan and Stephanie Snyder of Martin Hospitality, which also operates Cannon Beach's Stephanie Inn, Surfsand Resort and The Wayfarer Restaurant.\n\"We're excited to move forward with a project that's been a lifelong dream for me,\" Ryan Snyder said in the release. \"We look forward to offering a unique new venue on the North Coast, and leaving our mark on Oregon's respected beer culture.\"\nAccording to the Oregon Brewer's Guild, Public Coast will be the 23rd Oregon Coast brewery and third in Cannon Beach, after Bill's Tavern & Brewhouse and Warren House Pub.\nFood, including fish and chips, grass-fed burgers, homemade sausages and gluten-free fare, comes courtesy of Martin Hospitality Chef Will Leroux. The brewery's name was inspired by the Oregon Beach Bill, the 1967 legislation that ensured the Oregon Coast would remain open to the public.\n-- Michael Russell Follow @tdmrussell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tdmrussell"], "published": "2015-10-19T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:10:34.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
