On Thursday, Millar and another former Sox player, Sean Casey, shared a bit of insight into such things with Seth Meyers on Late Night .\nThey confirmed that Manny Ramirez did indeed put Viagra in some beverages and chatted about when Casey caught a foul ball at the Home Run Derby.\n Millar also discussed his way of dodging Red Sox fans when he really needed to get somewhere.\n“I used to walk off the bus, and you’d leave there, and there are people, and the next thing you know, you got fans,” Millar told Meyers. “And you can’t sign for everybody, and if you’ve got a two minute bus, you’ve gotta roll, right? You’ve got a stream of people.”\n“So you’d have to fake [a] phone call walk of shame through,” he explained. “[You’d be like,] ‘Hello? Yeah, yeah,’ and you’re talking—‘What?! Come on, honey!’—and you start screaming and then it gets more uptight. Next thing you know, you’re good. Like, ‘Woah, that guy’s crazy, next. Lou Merloni, can I have your signature?’”\n“So you pretended to be crazy?” asked Meyers.\n“I pretended to be crazy. I wasn’t crazy, correct.”\nOK, Kevin, gotcha.\nWhat if the Red Sox were all homegrown?\nPrevious -- of -- Next Catcher: Chris Iannetta – Born in Providence, Rhode Island; attended St. Raphael Academy in Providence; MLB stats through 2014: 760 games, .236 BA, 90 HR, 344 RBI.
