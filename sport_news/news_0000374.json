Pieri waived his right to a jury trial when proceedings began Monday morning.\nThe trial's opening comes four years after the Lake County State's Attorney's office brought criminal charges against Pieri, who at the time was the highest-ranking member of the Highwood Fire Department and the husband of a sitting alderwoman, as well as the son of a former alderman.\nThe state's attorney's office previously dropped the most serious charge of theft involving more than $100,000, but the former Highwood fire official still could face prison time and forfeiture of his firefighter's pension for a felony conviction related to his employment.\nAfter Pieri turned himself in to Lake County Sheriff's police in the fall of 2011, the city of Highwood placed him on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation into the theft charges. Pieri, of the 500 block of Lockard Lane in Highwood, continued to draw his salary of about $66,000 until two years ago, when former City Manager Scott Hartman filed a formal complaint with the city's Board of Fire and Police Commissioners. Weeks later, the board voted 2-1 to suspend Pieri without pay.\nJudge shortage delays ex-Highwood fire official's theft trial Jim Newton The official misconduct and theft trial of suspended Assistant Highwood Fire Chief Ronald Pieri was postponed Monday to July 6.\nJudge Victoria Rossetti said Monday that the number of judges available this week in Lake County Circuit Court left her without a back-up judge to handle the regular court...\nThe official misconduct and theft trial of suspended Assistant Highwood Fire Chief Ronald Pieri was postponed Monday to July 6.\nJudge Victoria Rossetti said Monday that the number of judges available this week in Lake County Circuit Court left her without a back-up judge to handle the regular court...\n(Jim Newton) Hartman's complaint alleged that Pieri \"falsely claimed and/or reported compensation time for work he could have performed, at least in part, during his regular shift.\" The complaint alleged his actions had cost city taxpayers about $50,000 since the start of 2007.\nHighwood's fire and police board is awaiting the outcome of the criminal case before conducting a hearing to determine if Pieri's employment should be reinstated. The panel had hired the McGrath Consulting Group to conduct a study of how Pieri was paid, and whether his position — serving both as a fire department administrator and an on-call firefighter — fell under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The commission later decided not to apply the results of the study.\nPieri's defense lawyers say that if anything, the former deputy chief was underpaid for the hours worked, and have blamed the city's poor record-keeping for the discrepancies.\nkberkowitz@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter @KarenABerkowitz\nCopyright © 2015, Lake County News-Sun Crime Highwood", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-553e8c19/turbine/ct-lns-pieri-trial-st-0428-20150427", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56251180/turbine/ct-hpn-ronald-pieri-trial-tl-1022-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:28:30.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
