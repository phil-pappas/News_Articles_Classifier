Latest Yankees stories A-Rod, Gardner sit for Game 2 \nAnd it will be there only because the Diamondbacks did the Yankees a huge favor with their victory over the Astros in Phoenix. \nRegardless, the Yankees (88-74) enter the postseason an utter mess, having lost six of seven, including Sunday's 9-4 loss the Orioles in front of 33,224 at Camden Yards that completed a Baltimore sweep. \nIt was a game in which many of the issues plaguing the Yankees the last month swirled together on a cloudy, 56-degree afternoon: erratic starting pitching, few trustworthy bullpen options and, of course, a lack of timely hitting, even against a starter who came in with a 5.05 ERA. Yankees Yankees vs. Orioles \nMichael Pineda failed to get out of the fourth inning and, in that inning, Joe Girardi turned to lefthander Chris Capuano, who allowed an inherited runner to score and one of his own, allowing the Orioles to take a 5-1 lead. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nThe lead grew to 7-1 before the Yankees scored three runs late to make it 7-4. Chris Davis' second home run of the game, which gave him an MLB-high 47 on the season, made it 9-4 in the eighth. \nOrioles righthander Chris Tillman, who entered 10-11 with a 5-plus ERA, allowed two runs, seven hits and four walks over 51/3 innings. The Yankees managed plenty of baserunners but were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position through five innings, on their way to a 1-for-12 performance. \nIt did not start well for Pineda, who needed 26 pitches to get through the first, and ended up allowing four runs and six hits over 32/3 innings. \nAfter the Yankees put two on with two outs in the first but did not score -- Brian McCann ran his hitless streak to 19 at-bats with a flyout with runners at second and third -- the Orioles scored twice in the bottom of the inning. Gerardo Parra singled with one out and went to third on Davis' two-out double. Matt Wieters then lined a 2-and-2 slider to right for a two-run single that made it 2-0. \nThe Yankees came right back in the second, cutting their deficit in half. Greg Bird led off with a double, went to third on Chase Headley's groundout to first and came in on Dustin Ackley's groundout to second. \nIt remained 2-1 until the fourth when Wieters led off with a double. Pineda retired Steve Pearce and Steve Clevenger, but J.J. Hardy delivered a five-hopper up the middle for an RBI single that made it 3-1. \nGirardi then called for Capuano, DFA'd three times in the season's second half, to face the lefthanded-hitting Ryan Flaherty. The second baseman ripped a shot off the pitcher's leg, the ball ricocheting and landing near Ackley, the Yankees' second baseman, who saw it cue-ball past him into right for an odd-looking double. After an intentional walk to Nolan Reimold, Parra improved to 8-for-12 with five RBIs in the series with a two-run single that made it 5-1. \nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s sports newsletter for stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:14:17.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
