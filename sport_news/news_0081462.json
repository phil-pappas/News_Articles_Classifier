As a result, Blatter and Platini were suspended by Fifa’s ethics committee.\nOn to the game outside Fifa’s boardroom, Pele termed Argentine forward Lionel Messi as the “best in last 10 years”, but also spoke highly of fellow Brazilian Neymar and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo.\n“It’s very difficult to make a comparison of players of different generations. But in last 10 years Messi was the best. Ronaldo plays forward and tries to score while Messi plays with a different style. In my team I would love to have both... We have Neymar who also has good future,” he said.\nThe 74-year-old agreed that the sport has become highly competitive, but Pele said he would have been successful had he played in this generation. “No doubt football today is more tough than before but when God gifts you to play football it’s the same in any generation. Football is all about skill. I’m sure Beto would have been equally successful had he played in this era,” he said.\n sports football Pele Sepp Blatter Also Read Martina Hingis will play for Hyderabad in Champions Tennis League Sania Mirza- Martina Hingis in Wuhan Open semifinals Google dedicates a doodle for India vs Pakistan World Cup clash Louis van Gaal looks to replicate Dutch success with Manchester United", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151013/sports-football/article/pele-has-no-interest-fifa-top-post", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Brazil%20Pele%20Hospitali_Kand_1_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Brazil%20Pele%20Hospitali_Kand_1_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:11:02.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
