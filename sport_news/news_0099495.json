Tony Snell has started every exhibition game, including Monday night’s against New Orleans, and Fred Hoiberg had no immediate plans to change that.\n“I like the rhythm right now that Doug’s had coming off the bench,’’ the first-year coach said. “Again, we have five more opportunities to evaluate that, and again, early on in the beginning of the season we’ll see what lineup fits best.\n“Again, it doesn’t matter to me who starts the game. I want to see the guys that go out and deserve to be out there at the end of the game when you’re trying to win, and who is going to make the clutch plays. Doug’s been awesome, he’s been great.’’\nMore importantly, he’s been confident.\nThat wasn’t the case last season for the 11 th overall pick. A knee injury and an inability to grasp the Tom Thibodeau defense seemed to zap the forward of confidence as the year went on.\n“It’s big for me,’’ McDermott said of that growing confidence. “I’m kind of approaching every day the same. I’m getting better every day and keep building on what I’ve done so far.’’\nEspecially on the defensive side.\n“I think I’m moving a lot better than last year,’’ McDermott said of his defense. “Now it’s getting the terms down, the terminology they have us doing.’’\nEven with all the improvements, however, as well as a replacement needed for Mike Dunleavy (back surgery) in the starting lineup, Hoiberg continued to hint that McDermott might serve the team better as a scoring punch off the bench.\n“I like it,’’ McDermott said of life as a bench player. “It kinda gets you a second to take the game in, adjust to the atmosphere. I’d do either but right now I’m in a good little groove and I’m confident.’’\nInjury updates\nJoakim Noah has been dealing with some knee soreness, so missed the Monday game against the Pelicans, while the Bulls were still being cautious with Taj Gibson and his recovery from offseason ankle surgery.\nThe good news was that Dunleavy was on a treadmill for the first time Monday, which was his first activity since undergoing the back surgery just before camp started.\nRookie praise\nFirst-round pick Bobby Portis continued to open eyes, and not just in preseason game, but anytime he steps on the court.\n“The kid plays for dinner,’’ Hoiberg said. “He goes out every time. He runs the rim every time. The great thing about him is he’s asked to come out of the game three times already. That’s a great sign. I love when guys are playing so hard that they have to come out for a break.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:30:35.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
