Can the Eaglesâ€™ pass defense contain them? Yes. View results \nJohnson, who was limited at practice with a right knee and ankle injury, is the team's starting right tackle. He does not practice at left tackle, and Kelly said the Eagles would not put him there if Johnson doesn't practice in that spot. If Tobin is the left tackle, the team could play Dennis Kelly at right guard. \nThe good news for the Eagles was that left guard Allen Barbre (groin) returned to practice after sitting out Tuesday. Kelly does not anticipate adding an offensive lineman this week, which would indicate that the team does not expect to be missing more than one lineman for the game. Just like Andy \nKelly took more of the responsibility for the team's offensive woes, going beyond his usual claims that the problems are related to execution. Kelly channeled former coach Andy Reid's famous response to similar problems. \n\"I've got to do a better job play-calling and put us in better situations so we've got a little bit manageable third-down situations, in terms of always being in third-and-long,\" Kelly said. \"Percentage-wise, you're just not going to convert as much as you are going to convert on third-and-short and third-and-medium.\" \nThe Eagles have converted 26.5 percent of their third downs. That's the second-worst percentage in the league. The only team worse is the Chiefs, coached by Reid. Sitting out \nAlso missing practice were cornerback Byron Maxwell (quadriceps), linebacker Kiko Alonso (knee), defensive end Brandon Bair (groin), and linebacker Mychal Kendricks (hamstring). Defensive ends Cedric Thornton (hand) and Taylor Hart (shoulder) practiced after missing the last two games. Safety Chris Maragos (quadriceps) practiced after missing the Washington game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:36:41.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
