Jarryd Hayne has described the San Francisco 49ers' last-minute loss to the New York Giants as tough, but insists he'll keep trying to make the most of opportunities on the field. \nHayne was rarely sighted in the 30-27 defeat at the Giants' Met-Life Stadium and sat out the entire first half. \n\"Making the most of my opportunities,\" Hayne wrote to fans on Instagram. \n\"Tuff loss against the Giants! \n\"Close losses are the worst.\" \nHayne added it was \"good to see\" a fan in a Parramatta Eels jersey in the stadium. \nFans took to social media during and after the game to call on the 49ers to give Hayne more playing time and the Australian might get that with running back Reggie Bush aggravating a calf injury against the Giants. \nWhen Hayne was given opportunities in the Giants game he excelled, including coming in as running back in the third quarter and almost scoring a touchdown. \n49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick handed Hayne the ball, the Australian broke through the Giants' defensive line on an eight-yard run and was brought down just four yards short of the end zone. \nWith Giants' quarterback Eli Manning commanding his team's offence with 41 completions from 54 passing attempts for 441 yards and three touchdowns, Giants' Australian punter Brad Wing only had two opportunities to punt to Hayne. \nHayne, encircled by Giants, killed the first with a fair catch. \nThe second punt showed the skills of both Australians, with Wing's left foot booting the ball 55 yards downfield, Hayne ran to his right, caught the ball over his left shoulder near the sideline and then went on another powerful run for a 16-yard return. \nThe 49ers had a 27-23 lead with 1:45 left, but Manning threw the match-winning touchdown to tightend Larry Donnell with 21 seconds left. \nIt was the 49ers' fourth straight loss and fall to a one win, four loss record while the Giants improved to three wins, two losses. \nThe 49ers return home next weekend to take on the misfiring 1-4 Baltimore Ravens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:51:51.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
