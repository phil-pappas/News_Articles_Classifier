Nathan Fellinger CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nKIRTLAND, Ohio -- This is the kind of story that will make you smile. \nAccording to Kirtland Superintendent Ray Sullivan, Kirtland's 7th grade football coach and coaches from Chagrin Falls, got together to discuss giving Kirtland's Nathan Fellinger a chance to run the football in their game Tuesday. \nWhat those in attendance won't ever forget was the touchdown Nathan Fellinger scored on his first career carry. \nFellinger, a seventh grader at Kirtland, suffers from severe ADHD and a cognitive developmental delay, and had never suited up for a game before. \nInstead, he carried water bottles and did whatever he could for the past few seasons just to be a part of the team. \n\"He's been with me for the last few years,\" said Kirtland seventh grade coach Ray Sullivan. \"I wanted to get him one play last year when I was coaching the 'A' team, but youth regulations were a little bit tougher.\" \n\"At first, the idea our kids had was to allow Nathan a chance to carry the ball, but the Chagrin players came forward and wanted to see him run for a touchdown. That's exactly what he did!\" Sullivan said. \n\"These kids on both sides of the ball created a moment for Nathan that he will never forget. They also created a moment for themselves and all of us that will endure for a long time to come. The score of the game didn't matter. In the end, kindness won!\" \n\"Thanks to Ray Sullivan, Kirtland's Athletic Director, Matt Paul, Chargrin's Athletic Director, Charlie Barch, and Chagrin middle school coach, Todd Tombs and the wonderful 7th graders from Kirtland and Chagrin Falls. \nThanks also to Steve Hare from Ohio Varsity for capturing the story. We are proud of you all!
