It wasn't clear whether those involved were fans of rival teams. Detectives were interviewing witnesses and reviewing stadium surveillance footage, Hernandez said.\nDodger spokesman Steve Brener said Tuesday that the team had no comment.\nSecurity at Dodger Stadium came under national scrutiny after a 2011 attack in the parking lot on opening day left San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow with brain damage. Two men -- Marvin Norwood and Louie Sanchez -- pleaded guilty in the beating and went to prison.\nStow sued the Dodgers and their former owner Frank McCourt, blaming them for the attack because of insufficient security and lighting. A jury faulted the team, along with Sanchez and Norwood, and awarded Stow nearly $18 million after a six-week trial in 2014.\nTop Baseball ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:29:21.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
