The Old Lady will have to do without Alvaro Morata and Paul Pogba when they return to Turin. \nInitial reports suggested Morata may have fractured his leg but recent news has been more encouraging for Juve fans with estimates of around three weeks being reported in terms of recovery time. \nKarim Benzema scored twice for France against Armenia but was forced to leave the pitch minutes before the full-time whistle with a hamstring injury. \nFunnily enough it may have been caused by Antoine Griezmann jumping on Benzema’s back during celebrations. That’s Athletico’s Griezmann on Real’s Benzema. Suspicious… \nEngland’s record goalscorer and Dream Team darling Wayne Rooney is set to miss out on England’s trip to Lithuania on Monday. However he should be ready to play at least some part against his boyhood club Everton on 17 October. \nFinally we come to Chelsea, it’s only fitting we leave them to last. \nBoth Branislav Ivanovic and Nemanja Matic were forced off in Serbia’s hostile match with Albania although Chelsea fans were considerable less annoyed about the former’s injury. \nWith another round of games still to play we advise international managers take the proper precautions to prevent further losses. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
