Remaining in that position will be tough when they travel south to face the undefeated Carolina Panthers in Sunday Night Football (KGW-8 (NBC), 5:25 p.m. PT/8:25 p.m. ET) .\nThe Eagles (3-3) have moved into the to spot in the NFC East behind tough defense and a resurgent running game. The Eagles defense has forced 16 turnovers, second in the NFL and they've allowed 18.3 points a game, sixth in the league.\nThe offense hasn't been as consistent, particularly quarterback Sam Bradford. He has thrown nine interceptions, tied for second in the NFL. Most glaring is his three interceptions in the end zone in the last two games.\nThe Panthers (5-0) are riding the high of beating Seattle, arguably their biggest regular season win in franchise history. Not only did they beat the two-time defending conference champions, they won by scoring the game-winning touchdown with 32 seconds remaining in Seattle, where the Seahawks rarely lose.\nIf you want to watch the Eagles take on the Panthers, here's what you need to know:\nWhat : Philadelphia Eagles at Carolina Panthers\nWhere : Bank of American Stadium, Charlotte, NC\nWhen : Sunday, Oct. 25, 5:25 p.m. PT/8:25 p.m. ET\nTV : KGW-8 (NBC)\nWatch online : You can watch the live stream online on DirecTV's live stream package\n-- Geoffrey C.
