Carlson, who kicked three field goals in Auburn's 30-27 win, was named one of the three \"Stars of the Week\" on Monday by the selection committee of the Lou Groza Award, which honors the nation's top kicker with a year-end award. Carlson kicked field goals of 34, 29 and 52 yards as Auburn's special teams continued a solid season. Carlson is the only kicker in the country with three field goals of at least 51 yards this season. His 56-yarder in the season-opener is the second longest in the nation. His four 50-plus-yard field goals in his last seven games match all the 50-plus-yard field goal over the previous 150 Auburn games. Carlson, who also kicks off, has teamed with punter Kevin Phillips to control the opposition's efforts to return kicks. Opposing teams have returned only four kickoffs, the fewest in the nation, and three punts against Auburn. The combined 131 return yards are the fewest in the country. Elliott Fry of South Carolina and Austin Rehkow of Idaho were also honored by the Lou Groza Award this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:15:50.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
