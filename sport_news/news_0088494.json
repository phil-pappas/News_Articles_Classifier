Perry IV has had no shortage of advice when it comes to preparing for any of the three sports in which the junior excels. That will happen when your family’s name fills up the record books and the banners in the rafters of your high school gym.\nThe family legacy was borne through his grandparents. The late Ernie Perry Jr. coached track at Lawrence, Central Catholic and Methuen. His maternal grandfather, Jim Curtin, was a legendary baseball coach at Burlington High, amassing 612 wins over a 52-year career.\nHis father, E.J. Perry III, is the current football and girls basketball coach at Andover. On his father’s side, Perry’s uncle John was one of the greatest wide receivers ever to play at the University of New Hampshire and currently coaches tight ends with the Houston Texans. James Perry was an Ivy League Player of the Year as a quarterback at Brown and currently coaches at Princeton. Uncle Tim was a star quarterback at Harvard and Uncle Matt was a standout receiver for Northeastern.\nOn his mother Kathleen’s side, Kevin and Jimmy Curtin both pitched at Harvard while Jack Curtin pitched at Boston College.\n“Everywhere you look, whether it’s the record book or up in the rafters, you see my uncles’ names and the legacy they’ve left,” the younger Perry said. “The only thing that they don’t have over me is a state championship, and that’s really the only thing I’m trying to get on them.”\nWhile everyone in the family is more than qualified to weigh in with on-the-field accomplishments, perhaps the most important piece of advice Perry has taken to heart came from his uncle James.\n“The biggest thing is, my uncle James tells me just to focus on today,” Perry said. “Every single day you have to work to get better. His main motto is every single day you’ve got to come with the attitude that you need to get better, whether it be in school, the classroom, the field, no matter where you are. You can’t just go through the motions.”\nThe 6-foot-2, 190-pound junior has clearly heeded those words. Perry had a breakout season as a sophomore, throwing for 2,128 yards and 26 touchdowns. With a fleet of talented receivers to throw to such as Dan Gemmell, Andy Soucy and Brandon Marti, Perry has thrown for 797 yards and 11 scores in three games (all wins) this season and helped engineer the eighth-ranked Golden Warriors’ biggest victory in years with four TD passes in a 38-15 victory over BC High last Friday.\nOne of the big things E.J. Perry III taught his son early on was, to become a great quarterback you first have to earn the respect of your receivers and your line. While he couldn’t remember the exact game, the Andover coach most certainly saw the moment when that came to fruition for his son.\n“There was a pass that he made that Andy Soucy made this spectacular, one-handed catch that went for a touchdown, and when Andy came back, he tapped E.J. on the back and told him it was the best pass he’d ever seen,” the elder Perry recalled. “I was laughing because I thought it was maybe the best catch I’d ever seen, but that Andy came to E.J. and patted him on the back for the throw, it showed me he was becoming a leader and had earned their respect.”\nThat leadership, along with his inherent athletic gifts and the wisdom of his family’s legacy have all worked together and have Perry and his Andover teammates pointed in exactly the direction they wish to go.\n“The most important thing is the next game, so right now it’s Tewksbury (tonight),” Perry said. “But in hindsight, we have goals. We want to win a Merrimack Valley Conference title and make a deep run in the playoffs and hopefully get to a Super Bowl. That’s the highest standard we set for ourselves and what we hope to accomplish throughout the season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:41:17.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
