Fugon and Gustavo Barahona, another Honduran migrant worker, were arrested by New Llano (LAH-noh) police May 29 outside a motel as they waited to go to work.\nLast week, their lawyers released an email in which a DHS attorney recommended releasing the men because they appeared to be arrested \"solely for an immigration status check.\"\nBarahona's lawyers say he faces deportation later this week.\nThey spent more than 140 days in detention.\nThe New Orleans Workers' Center for Racial Justice has filed civil rights complaints with the Justice Department.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
