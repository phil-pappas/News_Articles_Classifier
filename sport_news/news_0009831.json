Defensive coordinator Will Muschamp was asked if Lawson could make his return against the Rebels.\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"Coach (Gus Malzahn) will address that. He met with Dr. (James) Andrews over the weekend and I think Gus will address that Tuesday.\"\nMalzahn addresses injuries and personnel decisions with the media Tuesday mornings. Auburn did not practice Sunday to rest following a quadruple-overtime loss at Arkansas on Saturday.\nLawson traveled with the team to Kentucky on Oct. 15 and Arkansas on Saturday, and did so without the support of crutches for the first time since injuries his hip in the first half agaisnt Louisville. He finished the season opener with four tackles, including a sack and two drops for losses.\n\"His presence means a lot for our guys,\" Muschamp said. \"He's certainly a leader on our defense and a guy that is an experienced good football player, a productive football player. Part of being a leader is you've got to be productive. He's a guy that's been there and done that at a high level and continues to provide good leadership to our guys. Certainly, hopefully, if we get him back on the practice field this week it will be a huge bonus for us from a mental standpoint as much as anything.\"\nLawson returned to practices last week and was running along the sidelines during the Tigers' typical group practices. He did not participate in practices against teammates. He met with Andrews last week, too.\nMuschamp said Wednesday \"we certainly expect him back, unless we have some sort of setback.\"\nJumping out the gym\nâ€” carl lawson (@carllawson14) October 25, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/carllawson14/status/658079617962659840"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:07:04.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
