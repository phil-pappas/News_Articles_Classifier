Cespedes hit .286 with three RBIs in the NLCS and expects to be ready for the World Series that starts Tuesday night at either Kansas City or Toronto. \n\"This is incredible — this has been the greatest moment of my career this far,\" he said through an interpreter. \"I really don't have words to explain how I'm feeling right now.\" \nCespedes walked and scored on Lucas Duda 's three-run homer in the first inning of Game 4. He struck out looking in the second and was replaced by Juan Lagares before the bottom half of the inning. \n\"After the first at-bat when I went back to the dugout, it just started bothering me,\" Cespedes said. \"That's when I felt it.\" \nCespedes, who turned 30 on Sunday, was acquired in a July 31 trade with Detroit and helped New York win the NL East title with 17 homers in 57 games with the Mets. He is eligible for free agency after the season. \n\"Cespedes' shoulder is going to be OK,\" manager Terry Collins said. \"They didn't think there was any damage. They thought an injection would calm it down in a day, so he'll be ready. We're going to work out on Friday and I'm sure he'll be ready for that.\" \nJay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap New York Mets' Lucas Duda is congratulated by Yoenis Cespedes, left, and Curtis Granderson, right, after hitting a three-run home run during the first inning of Game 4 of the National League baseball championship series against the Chicago Cubs Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015, in Chicago.
