His  last century was against Pakistan in a World Cup match at  Adelaide in February early this year. \n\nVirat Kohli plays a shot en route his 138 against South Africa in  Chennai on Thursday \nKohli shared a 104-run partnership for the third wicket  with Ajinkya Rahane (45) in 18.2 overs and then added 127 runs  in 18.4 with Suresh Raina (53) for the fourth wicket to  catapult India to a fighting total in their stipulated 50  overs. \nFor South Africa, Dale Steyn (3/61) and Kagiso Rabada  (3/54) took three wickets each, while Chris Morris (1/55)  scalped one at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here. \nEarlier electing to bat, India slumped to 35 for two  after both the openers -- Rohit Sharma (21) and Shikhar Dhawan \n(7) were sent back to the pavilion by Morris and Rabada  respectively. \nRohit was the first to be dismissed when his uppish shot  off Morris found the safe hands of Faf du Plessis at midwicket,  while Dhawan's downfall was brought by a stunning catch by  wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock. \nKohli and Rahane then joined hands as India scored just  43 runs losing two wickets in the first 10 overs. The duo  slowly started accelerating and helped India to cross the  100-mark in 19 overs. \nKohli was the more dominant between the two as he scored  his fifty in just 51 balls with the help of two boundaries and  two sixes. \nThe India Test skipper notched up his century in the 38th  over when he charged down the ground and blasted a six off  Phangiso over long-on. He scored his century in 112 balls,  with the help of four fours and three sixes. \nRaina too marked his return to form with a 52-ball 53  which was studded with three boundaries and one six before  becoming a victim of Steyn. Looking for a big shot, Raina  ended up giving a simple catch to de Villiers at midwicket.  \nIn pursuit to score more in the final overs, India lost  Kohli and Harbhajan Singh (0) in the same over with Rabada  doing the damage in consecutive deliveries of his last over. \nSkipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (15) too perished in the  last over when he tried to play a shot by making room for a  short ball from Steyn, only to find de villiers at mid off as  India got just 29 runs from the final 30 deliveries, losing 4  wickets in the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:45:34.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
