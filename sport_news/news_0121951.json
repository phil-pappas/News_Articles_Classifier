If Slauson starts at center, it will be a new player at all five spots since the dress rehearsal that is the third week of preseason.\nIt's hardly ideal but serves as an early reminder that when arranging positions of need with an eye toward the future, you can't forget the line. Circumstances have created a situation in which the coaches and front office will be able to evaluate young players on the roster, and that will be beneficial and perhaps even fortuitous if left tackle Charles Leno and center Hroniss Grasu perform well.\nLeno is expected to start at left tackle for the second straight week in place of Jermon Bushrod, who has a concussion and shoulder injury, and center Will Montgomery's broken left leg means it's only a matter of when, not if, third-round pick Grasu gets action.\nSticking with five guys just to have awareness and timing that comes with continuity doesn't make sense if they're not the best five players, and certainly that factored into the move of Long to right tackle even if the timing was less than ideal.\n\"Look at the team that won the Super Bowl last year,\" offensive coordinator Adam Gase said. \"I remember watching a game about five or six weeks in, and they were talking about the different groups of linemen they had gone through. Sometimes it takes time to find the right group you want together.\"\nGase has good recall on the Patriots. At the midpoint of last season they had seven linemen who had logged significant playing time at the three interior positions. Tackles Nate Solder and Sebastian Vollmer remained in place, but it was up for grabs on the inside for about two months partly because the Patriots had traded mainstay guard Logan Mankins to the Buccaneers in late August.\nThat's not to suggest the Bears are going to find their glue in the trenches and mount a Super Bowl run. But along the way they just might discover some answers.\nNow Grasu needs to prove he's stronger than he was in preseason. The next step for Leno is putting together consistent performances after a solid showing Sunday against the Raiders. He's an important piece when considering back issues have plagued Bushrod all year.\nThere is a cautionary tale for general manager Ryan Pace in the downfall of former GM Jerry Angelo, who did a lot of good things in helping to build an NFC contender. Angelo and his staff went the nontraditional route putting together a strong offensive line built almost entirely through free agency. But he didn't make preparations for the future, and when most of the linemen went downhill in a short period, it created a mess. There weren't any young, able bodies on rookie contracts to fill in.\nIt's easy to point to busted draft picks and say that is why Angelo was dumped after 11 seasons, but trace his problems closely and they were rooted in not maintaining the offensive line.\nIn a span of five drafts from 2003-2007, the Bears had 42 total picks with 23 coming in the top four rounds. Only one of those 23 was an offensive lineman and only three linemen were selected overall â€” one in the sixth round and two in the seventh. The fourth-rounder, Josh Beekman, made 20 starts and didn't pan out.\nThat pushed the Bears into a corner, and they had to draft an offensive lineman in 2008. They chose Chris Williams 14th overall and left Brandon Albert, who then-line coach Harry Hiestand preferred, on the board.\nAlbert, the 15th pick, has started 94 of his 96 career games for the Chiefs and now the Dolphins. Williams, who came with a back injury, was a bust. Angelo was forced to re-draft the position in 2011 with Gabe Carimi 29th overall. He didn't work out either, and the franchise has been piecing it together since.\nThe point is the line is such a critical element that it almost always is going to fall into the need category. We will find out how much need the Bears have based on how young players perform in the final three-quarters of the season.\nSpecial stuff\nThe Bears will face former special teams coordinator Dave Toub, who left after the 2012 season when he was interviewed but not offered the head coaching position. He reunited with Andy Reid on the Eagles and went with him to the Chiefs.\nIn Toub's nine seasons on Lovie Smith's staff, the Bears had five different players earn Pro Bowl honors on special teams and scored 25 return touchdowns (including the postseason).\nCurrent coordinator Jeff Rodgers is adjusting quickly. The Bears, who used an NFL-high 67 players on special teams last season, already have had 47 this year. Only the Redskins, Texans and Chargers (48) have used more. The team has acted quickly, bringing in veteran special teamers Chris Prosinski and LaRoy Reynolds last week after consecutive games with a kickoff return touchdown allowed.\nOne of the issues the team faced last year when it struggled on special teams was an overabundance of inexperienced players. Late in the season, the Bears used rookies or first-year players for 38 percent of the snaps taken on special teams. Rodgers has a core of rookies he's using as well but that figure is down to 28.4 percent through four games.\nThat's the nature of the beast on special teams. Backups stock those units, and in many instances young players are lower on the depth chart. It's a process finding which ones can make plays and then hoping they stay in place through the ebb and flow of the roster as the season unfolds.\nbmbiggs@tribpub.com\nTwitter @BradBiggs\nPrivacy Policy Hroniss Grasu Kansas City Chiefs New England Patriots Kyle Long Adam Gase Tampa Bay Buccaneers Will Montgomery", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561895de/turbine/ct-bears-essentials-biggs-spt-1011-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-10T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:14:46.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
