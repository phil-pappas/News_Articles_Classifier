Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow Creekview will look to extend its lead in Region 7 (A) when it hosts preseason favorite Dalton on Friday, but it won’t be a typical home game for the Grizzlies though.Instead of the game being played at the Grizzly Den as planned, it was moved to Etowah’s Eagles Stadium. After Creekview’s home opener last week was marred by rain and a malfunctioning lighting system, coaches and administrators elected to move the game.“We got out on the field on Wednesday, and we just made the decision for safety reasons to move the game,” Creekview coach Terry Crowder said. “It looks like we’ll be getting more rain on the way, and I don’t want to put anybody at risk playing on a sloppy, muddy field. Etowah was gracious enough to host us, so we decided to make the change.”Though the move may take away the traditional home-field advantage for Creekview (3-2, 2-0), it may give the Grizzlies an even greater advantage. Before the move was made, Crowder expressed concern with throwing in the adverse conditions, after quarterback Kyle Wilkie only completed nine passes for 90 yards last week, but he has much more faith in his passing offense now that the game will be played on artificial turf.In addition to the possible resurgence of its passing game, Creekview should also benefit from the emergence of a running game. Last week, Wilkie and freshman Cade Radam combined to rush for a season-high 163 yards in the Grizzlies’ 21-14 win over Cass. “I think it gives us confidence, because we really had to get away from what we like to do,” Crowder said. “The conditions were no good, but we found a way to score enough points to win. It was a tough game to win, but, at the end of the day, we got the job done.”Defensively, Creekview will have the unenviable task of stopping Dalton (3-2, 1-1) and its two-headed rushing attack of Drake McCowan and Darien Hill, who have combined to rush for 560 yards and eight touchdowns this season.However, defense is another area in which Creekview gained confidence last week after forcing four turnovers and holding Cass to 236 total yards. The Grizzlies will also get a boost from the return of senior Kevin Jones, who will join leading tacklers Dylan Carl and Addison Prater at linebacker.Crowder said the key to stopping Dalton will be forcing the Catamounts into tough situations and making them throw the football.“I think you just have to limit their big plays,” he said. “You have to be good on first and second down to get them in a third-and-long situations and limit their play-calls. We have to take them out of their comfort zone.”Although Creekview is a game up on Dalton in the subregion, Crowder said the Catamounts are better than their record indicates, and the Grizzlies won’t take tonight’s game lightly.“I think they’re a very good football team. They just had one bad game,” Crowder said. “They did not play very well against Cass, and it cost them the game. Every other game I’ve watched, they’ve been very good, so I think we’re going to have to play our best football game of the year.”A win tonight would allow Creekview to avenge its only subregion loss from last year, and Crowder held nothing back when discussing the importance. If the Grizzlies can get past Dalton, their final subregion games would be against Woodland-Bartow, Sequoyah and River Ridge — teams that are a combined 2-12 on the season. “This is a big game,” he said. “A win (tonight) lets us control our own destiny. We won’t need help from anybody, and I think it would pretty much assure us of a spot in the region championship game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:14:21.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
