By moving defender Andre Bois into the midfield as part of a 3-5-2 system, the Warriors erupted for six second-half goals, led by senior Jackson Hill’s hat trick, cruising past their Atlantic Coast League rival Clippers, 7-0. With the win, Nauset – which entered the game as a consensus top-10 team in the state – improves to a 8-0, 4-0 ACL and needs just one more victory to qualify for the Div. 2 South Sectionals. Falmouth falls to 3-5-1, 1-2-1 ACL. “I thought we were a little flat at practice and a little flat again here today,” McCully said. “Our energy level wasn’t high, but we changed our system and the start we had in the second half with two goals in the first 10 minutes really set us up.” Falmouth willingly handed Nauset possession in the opening half, sporting a low-pressure defense that attempted to keep all 11 defenders behind the ball. With a significant advantage on the attack, the Warriors failed to convert on a handful of scoring chances as frustration began to mount. But in the 35th minute, senior Noah Casey got the offense going when he sent a high cross in front of the net, finding Vance Bates briefly before James McCully finished off the play, sneaking the ball inside the near post. A halftime lead was nice, but not enough for coach McCully, who made the adjustments and saw them pay off immediately. Nauset needed just six minutes to double the lead, which came off a Falmouth own goal. Under significant pressure from the Warrior attack, Falmouth’s Sam Akkawi attempted to head a ball over his own net, but instead snuck one over keeper Zach Bowerman. Six minutes later, Nauset’s Hayden Yakola fired a bouncing ball inside the far post as the Warriors finally broke through the Clippers’ defensive wall. “Credit to Falmouth,” said McCully. “They played a low-pressure defense (and) they were willing to keep the score down and defend. “It took us a while to break them down, but once we did we could spread the ball.” Hill took over scoring for the remainder of the second half, scoring the next three Nauset goals from the middle of the field, beginning with a beautifully set up ball from Yakola that only required a tap in from Hill. Bois etched his name onto the score sheet eight minutes later when he lofted a perfect ball from 25 yards out onto the foot of Hill, who finished off the play. “We have a nice combination of balance,” McCully said. “We’re not blazing fast, we have good speed, but we are well-balanced and strong up the middle and have good flank play.” Nauset didn’t require the services of keeper Connor Canesi often, but the sophomore came up with a big save midway through the first half to keep the game scoreless. Off a misplayed clear at midfield, Falmouth’s Tyler Dufresne took off on a semi-breakaway but Canesi came away with a diving save.
