The only player out for the Jets will be running back Bilal Powell (ankle), which leads to the question of whether the Jets will activate running back Stevan Ridley from the PUP list.\nJets running back Stevan Ridley's name did not appear on Friday's injury report because the Jets have still not activated him from the PUP list (knee). Head coach Todd Bowles said the coaching staff would evaluate whether to do so Friday evening. For Ridley to be eligible to play Sunday, he must be activated by 4 p.m. Saturday.\nCannon was hurt last week at the Colts, the first game he played in place of Nate Solder, who's out for the season with a torn biceps.\nThe Pats are already without starting center Bryan Stork, who's on short-term IR. Last week, after Cannon was injured, they moved right tackle Sebastian Vollmer to the left side and had Cameron Fleming play on the right side. Fleming had only been activated from the practice squad a day earlier.\nThe Jets' defense has been fantastic this season, their defensive front in particular. A patchwork Patriots line is obviously advantageous for the Jets, but quarterback Tom Brady, per Pro Football Focus, has been taking just 2.19 seconds to get rid of the ball this seasonâ€”fastest in the league.\nRight guard Willie Colon is questionable for the Jets with a knee injury, but Bowles said Colon hadn't had any setbacks.\nWide receiver Chris Owusu, who is probable, told NJ Advance Media on Thursday he felt good to go.\nFor the latest on Jets slot corner Buster Skrine (concussion), click here .\nThe complete injury report for both teams:\nJets Out\nRB Bilal Powell (ankle)\nDoubtful\nS Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee)\nQuestionable\nRG Willie Colon (knee)\nProbable\nS Dion Bailey (elbow)\nOLB Quinton Coples (elbow)\nWR Eric Decker (knee)\nQB Ryan Fitzpatrick (right elbow)\nNT Damon Harrison (finger)\nWR Brandon Marshall (calf)\nWR Chris Owusu (knee)\nCB Buster Skrine (concussion)\nCB Marcus Williams (hamstring)\nDid not practice Friday\nRB Bilal Powell (ankle)\nLimited at practice\nRG Willie Colon (knee)\nWR Eric Decker (knee)\nS Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee)\nWR Brandon Marshall (calf)\nWR Chris Owusu (knee)\nCB Marcus Williams (hamstring)\nFull practice participation\nS Dion Bailey (elbow)\nOLB Quinton Coples (elbow)\nQB Ryan Fitzpatrick (right elbow)\nNT Damon Harrison (finger)\nCB Buster Skrine (concussion)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:48:49.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
