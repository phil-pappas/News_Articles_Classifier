Craig's only experience as a coach has come with Miami's Summer League team and that is why he and the Skyforce ownership are excited to see what he can do in a full season. \n\"I'm thrilled for the opportunity to be a head coach with a first class organization. For me it was very humbling and very exciting for myself and my family to come out here and bring value to the organization,\" Craig said. \n\"For them to trust that we will be a good place for Dan to be is really neat for us,\" Skyforce President, Mike Heineman said. \"To see the value in sending him to Sioux Falls to further his coaching career, I think, speaks volumes for what we are doing here in Sioux Falls,\" he added. \nAnd that is exactly what the Skyforce have done with their last two coaches. Both Pat Delany and Phil Weber each used their success in Sioux Falls to earn them coaching jobs in the NBA. Skyforce President, Mike Heineman, isn't concerned with the turnover knowing that his team is in a developmental league. \n\"As long as you get good ones after the other good ones leave, it's not that big of a deal. Obviously we are used to it though. You can't get mad about it, that is just the business we are in and the business we have chosen to be in. As long as we keep getting good guys after other good guys it's not so bad,\" Heineman said. \nAs for Craig he began in the video department as an intern with the HEAT more than a decade ago. He is inheriting a Skyforce team that finished first in their division last season and in the top ten in both offensive and defensive scoring. Two things he hopes to bring from South Beach to South Dakota. \n\"I have spent the last 12 years with the Miami HEAT and a lot of what we were doing there was blue-collar work with our team. We are the hardest working, most prepared, and best conditioned team. That is something that I am looking forward to bringing to Sioux Falls,\" Craig said. \nCraig and his Skyforce will tip off their season at home Saturday, November 14th against the Iowa Energy. Tickets are on sale now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:20:22.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
