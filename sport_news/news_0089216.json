Sophomore Jevon Carter is the presumptive frontrunner for that spot. As a freshman, Carter was West Virginia's third-leading scorer and that hope is that added responsibilities on offense won't affect his shooting ability. Junior Tarik Phillip emerged late last season and he too could step in at the point. Unfortunately for the Mountaineers, freshman guard Beetle Bolden is lost for the year with a torn ACL. While Bolden is ticketed for a redshirt, fellow true freshman Esa Ahmad will be counted on at a number of different spots on the floor. West Virginia's leading rebounder and leading returning scorer is Devin Williams. 67 games and two seasons into his Mountaineer career, Williams has established himself as one of the premier big men in the Big 12. He may add the responsibility of being a go-to guy in crunch time much like Staten was last winter.
