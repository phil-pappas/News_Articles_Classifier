(AP) - Ravens tight end Dennis Pitta has returned to the practice field, hopeful that he can rebound from a hip injury that's kept him sidelined since last year. \nPitta is on the physically unable to perform list. Baltimore has three weeks to decide whether to place him on the 53-man roster or season-ending injured reserve. \nAfter Wednesday's practice, Pitta said, \"It's a start. Obviously this is an assessment period.\" \nPitta had 61 catches for 669 yards in 2012 and scored a touchdown in the Super Bowl. \nBut after dislocating his hip the following year in training camp, he missed the first 12 weeks of the season. \nHis 2014 season ended in Week 3, when he fractured and dislocated the same hip without being touched.
