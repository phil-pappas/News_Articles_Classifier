I played soccer, and the most races I'd do in a season was probably four. Soccer wasn't going so hot for me, so I and my dad decided the best fit for me would be moving to Davis because I needed more of a team aspect.\"\nTimpanogos High continued its successful week, with the girls' soccer program advancing to the state championship game for an attempt at a three-peat, by capturing the Class 4A team title for its first-ever cross country title with a score of 69, which topped Mountain View's 88.\nProvo's Kate Hunter, a junior, won the individual medal in 4A with her time of 18:15.9. Olympus' Olivia Hoj (18.31.2), Mountain View's Mimi Miyazawa (18:35.1), Springville's Julie Sumsion (18:36.4) and Salem Hills' Haley Johnston (18:48.7) rounded out the top five.\n\"I'm really happy because there are a lot of good girls this year,\" Hunter said after winning her second straight individual title. \"… I was planning on staying behind the first person until 800 meters before [the finish]. I felt good at the beginning, the ending was really hard.\"\nThe Class 3A race featured controversy regarding whether runners from several teams cut at inappropriate junctures in the course rather than staying on the assigned pathway. In the end, Stansbury (60) earned a one-point victory over second-place Pine View (61). After finishing third as a freshman last season, Union's Kennedy Powell crossed first with a time of 18:58.4.\n\"I've been running this entire week, trying to convince myself that I would win,\" Powell said. \"Right afterward it hurts, but it's so amazing. Everything I worked for. I'm really happy at the moment.\"\nNorth Summit staved off Millard with a first-place total of 55 for the Class 2A title. The Eagles finished with 62. The two programs battled for the first-place individual honors, too, with Millard's Anna Camp (18:48.0) beating North Summit's Sadie Sargent by two-tenths of a second for her third consecutive medal.\n\"Run faster than the other girl,\" Camp said when asked what her thought process was at the final turn. \"It feels really good.\"\nParowan inched past Panguitch by two points to claim the Class 1A championship, but it was Panguitch's Whittni Orton who completed the perfect high school record with her fourth individual title with a final time of 18:29.1.\n\"I was trying to keep the pace. It's kind of hard to push myself,\" said Orton because of her lead over second-place Meghann Clare from St. Joseph (21:05.1). \"I'm really happy. This has been my goal for years.\"\n\ntphibbs@sltrib.com \nTwitter: @trevorphibbs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:38:15.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
