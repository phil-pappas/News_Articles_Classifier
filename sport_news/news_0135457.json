Granderson, Murphy and Flores were all excellent at the plate in the NLDS. David Wright (.063 batting average), Yoenis Cespedes (.250, though one of those hits was a monster home run), Lucas Duda (.111), Travis d'Arnaud (.158) and Michael Conforto (.143) were not. The Cardinals hit a lot better than the Mets did in the NLDS, and the Cubs wiped them out. A team with as much power as the Cubs has can strike at any moment. Duda and Wright, in particular, need to get going. \nCan they get the starters to match up right? Using Noah Syndergaard for one inning in Game 5 of the NLDS shouldn't, theoretically, keep him from starting Game 2 of the NLCS. While they'd probably rather have him or Game 5 starter Jacob deGrom kicking this off, it lines up well for them: Assuming there are no rainouts, the Mets should have the better starter for five of the seven games of this series … and those other two games (against Jake Arrieta) could be Syndergaard starts, if the Mets so choose. Playoff series are more than just pitching, but you'd rather have the matchup advantage, and the Mets do. \nWill there be a Cespedes moment? We asked this last series, but it's worth bringing up again: There is no player who electrifies the Citi Field crowd more than Cespedes. (Man, if he would have come up with the bases loaded in the eighth inning of Game 4 like he almost did, that place would still be shaking.) Every Cespedes at-bat has a chance to become immortal … and, for that matter, increase his price tag in the offseason. Even with the July additions, the Mets' offense is not a team strength, but they have one guy who can carry them in that area -- and that is clearly Yo. Three questions for the Chicago \nCan a third starter step up? Because they took care of the Cardinals in four games, Lester didn't have to start Game 5, allowing the Cubs to line up their rotation with Lester and Arrieta one-two. But that still means Hammel and Hendricks are going to have to start a game. Joe Maddon had extremely quick hooks with both of them in the NLDS, but that's harder to do when you're playing seven games in nine days rather than five in seven. The Cubs' bullpen is effective but patchwork; they will need more innings from their non-stud starters. Will they get them? \nWill they miss Addison Russell? The rookie shortstop was a halfway decent bat but, mostly, he was a steadying defender for a sometimes-shaky infield. Now, he's out for the entire NLCS, replaced by Baez, who hit the home run that gave the Cubs a Game 4 lead they'd never relinquish. Baez also made some mistakes on the infield, though, and the Cubs' defense, at least in the early innings before Maddon usually starts switching people around, has some issues. They will miss Russell. But how much? \nCan they keep getting all the big hits? The central organizing principle of the Cubs' wins over the Cardinals at Wrigley Field were all the home runs: Every time the Cards started a rally like the ones that have won them all those postseason series in the past, another Cub would launch a homer deep into the Chicago night. The Cubs are too young and too powerful, it seems, to realize how stressful these games are supposed to be. But eventually, no matter how good you are, October gets you. How will the Cubs react? They've had a relatively frictionless couple of months. But friction is coming. Prediction \nIf you pick postseason series based off pitching, you'll go with the Mets. If you pick them based on lineup depth and flexibility, you'll go with the Cubs. If you go with experience, you'll choose a tie -- but you can't a choose a tie because the series can't tie. Both teams come in with crazy momentum and an undeniable sense that This Is The Year. Your pick just depends on your personal philosophy. For this angle … I'll take the team with four starters who can throw the ball by you and a closer who faced 16 batters in the NLDS and didn't allow a baserunner. But this is going to be crazy no matter what happens. \nMets in seven. \n*** \nEmail me at leitch@sportsonearth.com ; follow me @williamfleitch ; or just shout out your window real loud, I'll hear you.
