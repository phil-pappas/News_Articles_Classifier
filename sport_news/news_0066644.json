The Mets scored 10 times in the first four innings against those two on their way to a 13-7 rout of the Dodgers in Game 3 of their National League Division Series Monday night.\nAnd now, for the second consecutive postseason, the Dodgers find themselves down two games to one in a best-of-five NLDS. And for the second consecutive October, they will turn to Kershaw â¦ on the road â¦ on three daysâ rest â¦ to pitch the series back to Los Angeles.\nâYou always feel good when youâve got that two-headed monster on our side,â Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal said, referring to Kershaw and Zack Greinke lined up for a potential Game 5. âTheyâve been doing it for us all year. If we go down, weâre going to go down with our two horses.â\nGrandalâs optimism is fresh out of the box. He wasnât around a year ago when the Dodgers were eliminated by the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 4 when Kershawâs night and the Dodgersâ season were ended on a three-run home run by Matt Adams.\nâI know weâre going with Kershaw. Heâs our guy,â Dodgers outfielder Andre Ethier said. âWe can have all the confidence in the world but weâve got to do our job as an offense and do a better job of getting more than three runs and take some pressure off him.â\nTheir offense couldnât reasonably be expected to keep up with what the Mets did to the soft underbelly of the Dodgersâ starting rotation Monday night. The 13 runs allowed by the Dodgers are the most theyâve ever given up in a postseason game. Nine of the 10 runs off Anderson and Wood scored with two outs.\nIf Kershaw gets another chance to change his postseason narrative in Game 4, Anderson and Wood were not ready for their moment in Game 3. Instead, they helped make history, each doing his part on a day that saw 20 home runs hit in playoff games â\" the most on a single day in postseason history.\nâThose guys have been OK. Theyâve been OK,â Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said, damning with faint praise when asked about the weakness at the back of his teamâs rotation â\" a season-long issue that only a healthy Hyun-Jin Ryu and Brandon McCarthy might have changed.\nâActually, Wood is throwing the ball pretty good for us. Brett has thrown the ball good, for the most part. No, theyâve been fine.â\nNot when the Dodgers needed them the most.\nMets right-hander Matt Harvey was not particularly sharp either, and the Dodgers grabbed an early 3-0 lead on Yasmani Grandalâs two-run single and a run-scoring error in the second inning. Whatever chance the Dodgers had of taking a raucous Citi Field crowd out of the game disappeared along with their lead in the bottom of the inning.\nYoenis Cespedes started the inning by bouncing a ground ball to Jimmy Rollins, making his first start in the series at shortstop with rookie Corey Seager on the bench. Cespedes beat Rollinsâ late throw to first base for the first of four consecutive Mets hits that drove in one run and loaded the bases. After Harvey struck out for the second out, Curtis Granderson ripped a double off the center field wall to drive in three runs. The Dodgersâ lead was gone and it quickly faded from memory as the Mets piled up more offense.\nTravis dâArnaud took Anderson deep for a two-run home run in the third inning, Andersonâs last of the night. The left-hander allowed six runs on seven hits while lasting just three innings. It was Andersonâs shortest stint since he left a July start in the third inning with an injured ankle.\n1 2 Next Page Related: Moura: Gotham loves its new villian in Chase Utley Chase Utley's takeout slide in Game 2 still a hot topic before Game 3 Mattingly says Kershaw on three days rest is best option for Game 4 NLDS Game 4: Dodgers at Mets, Tuesday, 5 p.m. Dodgers-Mets box score", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/utley-687278-game-mets.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/kershaw-687279-game-guy.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/utley-687304-game-night.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mets-687280-game-field.html", "http://sports.ocregister.com/mlb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=351012121&final=true"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:12:19.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
