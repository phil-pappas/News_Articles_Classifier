They weren’t much better with four turnovers of their own, but they refused to simply roll around in the slop with the Giants, coming away with a 27-7 victory at Lincoln Financial Field. \nAnd yes, they’re now tied with the Giants atop the division at 3-3. \nIt was nice to see Neptune native Vinny Curry do his Shamoney sack dance for the Eagles, getting 1.5 sacks, while another pressure of Eli Manning forced an intentional grounding penalty. \nThe Giants’ Damontre Moore did perform his sack dance as the first half was winding down, after their defense had been pushed down the field by the Eagles. Moore’s sack meant Caleb Sturgis had to kick a 37-yard field goal in the final seconds to give the Eagles a 17-7 halftime lead. \nIt came one play after the Giants second obvious roughing the passer penalty, with Moore picking up the first to jumpstart an Eagles first touchdown drive. Middletown Super Bowl alum joins heroin fight \nBasically, there was nothing to celebrate for the visitors. \nManning went from playing of the best games of his career in the dramatic comeback win over San Francisco, to playing one of the worst. \nAnd he got absolutely no help. \nThere was the interception where Eagles linebacker DeMeco Ryans took the ball away from tight end Larry Donnell as the Giants were about to enter the red zone after driving for a touchdown on their opening possession. \n``We both got there at the same time and he just made a great play,'' said Donnell. \nThe Eagles then drove for their first touchdown, thanks in large part to Moore’s roughing the passer call, as the Giants were stopping the Eagles on third down. \n``It was a bad penalty, and we had a bunch of them,'' Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. \nThe Giants would not score another point, their offense completely deflating when the Eagles stopped them on a fourth-and-one the next time they got the ball. \nThen there was the play where receiver Rueben Randle slipped while crossing with Dwayne Harris in the left flat, leaving Eagles cornerback Nolan Carroll in position to jump the route, make the interception and return it 17 yards for a touchdown. \n``A bad turnover on my part on the interception, I can’t do that,'' Manning said. ``They started getting good pressure. We tried to get ball downfield based on coverages and we just couldn’t do it.'' \nI could go on, but you get the point. \nThe Giants were terrible, after a pretty good start on both sides of the ball. \nWhat’s so stunning is that it was not supposed to go down this way. \nThe Giants looked like they had overcome their fear of primetime last Sunday against the 49ers with Manning’s fourth-quarter heroics, culminating with a perfectly thrown 12-yard touchdown pass to Donnell, with linebacker NoVorro Bowman draped all over him in the back of the end zone, with 21 seconds to play. \nThey seemed poised to seize control of the NFC East, in a game where a victory would have given them a 1 1/2-game lead in the division, with the Cowboys coming to the Meadowlands next Sunday. \nBut it wasn’t to be. \nThese were supposed to be the type of games Manning wold take over, which is why the Giants shelled out $84-million to extend his contract. There was no return on that investment in this one. \nNow the Giants, who have already lost to the Cowboys, face a must-win next Sunday. \nAnd it’s hard to know what to expect. Because after three straight wins, no one anticipated what transpired in Philadelphia Monday night. \nStaff writer Stephen Edelson is an Asbury Park Press columnist: sedelson@gannettnj.com 4 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RTh7gA TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:47:42.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
