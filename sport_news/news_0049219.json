It was the final home game of the season for Neelin and the team was disappointed it couldn’t produce a better result. \n“I think we just didn’t work as a team the way we should have, the way we’ve been practising. I think we need to put more of an effort in,” said Lincoln Zentner, a Grade 11 Spartans linebacker who had four tackles. “This is tough. Everyone wanted to win for our last home game, but it just didn’t happen.” \nThe loss drops the Spartans to 2-3 in the division, while the Tigers improve to 3-1. Only four teams from the Currie Division remain in it for the playoff round while the bottom seven drop into a newly formed Tier 4 playoff. The Spartans are on the outside looking in with one game remaining in Dryden, Ont., against the host Eagles (3-1) on Oct. 23. \nOn Thursday, the Spartans found some late life when quarterback Dayton Black scored on a quarterback sneak with 5:53 left in the fourth quarter to cut the deficit to 28-12. However, a long completion on the Tigers’ next drive set up a touchdown of their own 2:43 after Black’s score. \nThat dashed any hope of a comeback for the home side. \n“Of course it’s heartbreaking because you really think you should be able to come back with four minutes left in Canadian football,” said Neelin coach Robert Cullen. “We were moving the ball. We had two or three drives that were 80 or 90 yards plus. We just couldn’t score.” \nBlack went 6 of 12 passing for 72 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He also rushed for 138 yards on 20 carries. Lane Tufts ran for 87 more yards on 12 carries, while Dawson Harris caught three passes for 40 yards. Clark Nachtigall scored Neelin’s other touchdown on a 10-yard reception. \nEric Jenkins had four tackles and an assist while Justin Mulvaney and Braeden Marlow both had three tackles. \nNeelin’s playoff situation will be a little more clear before they play their next game and Cullen hopes his team stays motivated for its season finale. \n“The kids just have to want to play,” he said. “If you love to play, you’re going to be out there and playing. The unfortunate part of it right now is I’m not really sure how many love the game.” \nYARDSTICKS: The Spartans celebrated and honoured their alumni at Thursday’s game and provided a meal for them as well as current players and families after the contest … Neelin also officially opened its press box with mayor and alumnus Rick Chrest cutting the ribbon. The initial work on the press box began in September 2012 and was built with the support of the booster club and an $8,500 donation from UCT No. 448. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:42:07.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
