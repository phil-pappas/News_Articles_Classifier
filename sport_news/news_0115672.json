Posted: Thursday, October 22, 2015 6:00 pm \nD allas Stubbs is a Gator. \nAgain. \nThe Gainesville High alum earned a spot on the Florida football team after competing in Wednesday’s walk-on kicker tryout. \n“It was amazing,” Stubbs said Thursday. “I’m just so thankful and I hope to make everyone proud.” \nUF has yet to announce the addition of Stubbs to the roster. \nStubbs walked on at Florida in 2013, but said he was cut after the season to make room for Jorge Powell and Virginia Tech transfer Brooks Abbott. \nAbbott left the team last year but participated in Wednesday’s tryout. \n“The last time I was on the team, I felt like I didn’t get much of a chance,” Stubbs said. “This is just a new opportunity, brand new coaching staff.” \nA total of 216 students signed up for the tryout this week after the Gators announced they’re in need of a kicker following the season-ending injury to Powell last Saturday. \nAfter UF compliance reviewed the eligibility, credit hours and class schedules of the students, 77 made the c ut for Wednesday’s tryout in the indoor practice facility, including two women. \nBut Florida took Abbott, Stubbs and another student to kick separately in The Swamp. \n“We had a competition, three strikes and you’re out,” Stubbs said. “It came down to on-field performance and that’s what separated me.” \nStubbs made 42 of 50 field goal attempts dur ing his GHS career and won the District 7 Kicker of the Year award as a senior. In his last home game at Citizens Field, Stubbs hit a 52-yarder to help the Hurricanes beat Lake Gibson 10-9 and advance to the Class 4A state semifinals. \nStubbs will compete with Austin Hardin for the kicking job and get another chance to live out his childhood dream.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:11:30.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
