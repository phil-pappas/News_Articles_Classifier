Paul Yaras, the child was walking alone on Oleander Avenue and Suffield Street at 4:30 p.m. when Burke, who police said is in his 40s, pulled over and coerced the boy to his car and then exposed his genitals.\nBurke allegedly told police he had been driving in the area that day and also admitting to speaking to the boy, but he denied exposing himself, according to police.\nPolice said Burke lured the boy toward his vehicle by asking him if he lost $20 on the street, and when the child approached he noticed Burke was undressed from the waist down.\nBurke lifted up his shirt to expose his genitals and drove away, police said. A witness gave police a license plate that was later connected to the Palatine address of Burke's elderly parents.\nBurke's mother told police that her son had been driving the car, and Burke called Morton Grove police Wednesday night to turn himself in, according to Yaras.\nBurke has no sexual-related offenses on his record, police said.\nA community alert that was issued last week to schools near where the incident took place was canceled Thursday.\n\"There's no danger to the community, but we still want to put it out there that kids should never make contact with someone they don't know,\" Yaras said. \"If it's an adult, he should be asking another adult if he has a question â€” not a child.\"\nNatalie Hayes is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.\n Crime", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ff3c1/turbine/ct-mgc-exposure-arrest-tl-1022-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:15:58.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
