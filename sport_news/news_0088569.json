It feels like it’s the beginning. … People are not moping. It’s not like other postseason losses where people are plunged into depression.”\nWatch the complete Michael Wilbon interview:\nWilbon cited the young team and manager Joe Maddon as reasons why he isn’t as disappointed as he was, say, back in 2003 when the Cubs lost the NLCS in seven games.\nIn fact, Wilbon is so over the loss that he’s already thrown his support behind the NL-champion Mets – who eliminated the Cubs in four games.\nMaybe there's room on the W.S. Bandwagon for a Cubs fan…\n— Michael Wilbon (@RealMikeWilbon) October 22, 2015\nSo Chicago, how depressing was last night’s loss?
