Watch out for the firebrand No.7 to step into the shoes of Michael Hooper with ease. McMahon plays a different style to defensive pest Hooper, but his all-out aggression and focus on attack will be felt. He’s been man of the match in his past two Wallabies performances. \nWales: George North. Everybody in Australia remembers this guy from his brilliant British and Irish Lions tour in 2013. Most famously, North showed off brute strength to fling would-be defender Israel Folau up on his shoulder and carry him 10 metres downfield. Wales have moved him to the centres to involve him more. \nTeams: \nAustralia: Israel Folau, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, David Pocock, Sean McMahon, Scott Fardy, Dean Mumm, Kane Douglas, Sekope Kepu, Stephen Moore (capt), Scott Sio. Res: Tatafu Polota-Nau, James Slipper, Greg Holmes, Rob Simmons, Ben McCalman, Nick Phipps, Matt Toomua, Kurtley Beale. \nWales: Gareth Anscombe; Alex Cuthbert, George North, Jamie Roberts, Liam Williams; Dan Biggar, Gareth Davies; Taulupe Faletau, Justin Tipuric, Sam Warburton (capt); Alun Wyn Jones, Luke Charteris; Samson Lee, Scott Baldwin, Paul James.
