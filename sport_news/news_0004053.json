(AP) - A 14-year-old has pleaded guilty to killing a 13-year-old boy whose family had immigrated to the U.S. to escape the war in Iraq.\nJean Sanchez pleaded guilty Friday in Erie County Court in Buffalo, New York, to second-degree murder in the slaying of Ameer Al-Shammari in May 2014.\nSanchez was 13 when Ameer was killed. He was charged as an adult, but the maximum sentence he faces because of his age is nine years to life in prison.\nProsecutors say Ameer was trying to get his stolen cellphone back when Sanchez knocked him down, tied him up with his own shoelaces, sodomized him and strangled him with the string from Ameer's hooded sweatshirt.\nProsecutors say the plea comes three years and one day after Ameer immigrated to the U.S.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:00:06.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
