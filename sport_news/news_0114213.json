Just that quickly, the Cavaliers effectively gave the game away, too. \nThey lost 26-13 to North Carolina on Saturday after turning it over five times in the second half. \nTaquan Mizzell rushed for 117 yards and Matt Johns was 17 of 30 for 148 yards with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Hopkins for the Cavaliers (2-5, 1-2 Atlantic Coast Conference). \nJohns had one fumble and four interceptions in the second half, and was picked off in the end zone on a fourth-and-goal with under 6 minutes left. \n\"We didn't finish the game like we showed we could last week,\" coach Mike London said, referring to a triple-overtime win over Syracuse. \"It was disappointing to finish the way we did.\" \nElijah Hood rushed for 101 yards with two 3-yard scoring runs, T.J. Logan added a 16-yard TD and Nick Weiler kicked two field goals. \nNorth Carolina (6-1, 3-0) broke a 13-all halftime tie by scoring on its first three possessions of the second half, and pitched its second straight second-half shutout. \nIn their five games against FBS opponents, the Tar Heels have allowed a total of 24 second-half points. \n\"It's not about the adjustments and the speech and all that,\" UNC coach Larry Fedora said. \"It is really just staying calm and being patient ... and letting (the players) adjust to it. Our guys have played really well in the second half.\" \nVirginia's first four losses were to teams that either are or have been ranked in the Top 25. The Tar Heels, the nation's only unranked one-loss team from a power conference, hope to join that group when the new poll is released Sunday. \nMarquise Williams was 21 of 26 for 226 yards for the Tar Heels, who overcame two turnovers and a season-worst 13 penalties for 135 yards and set up a game with huge Coastal Division implications Thursday night when they visit No. 25 Pittsburgh. \n\"It's a win. We'll make it good,\" Fedora said. \"We'll point out the problems we had but how we overcame them is\" what's important, he added. \nThis was North Carolina's lowest-scoring win of the season. The Tar Heels — who have the ACC's most productive offense, averaging 482 total yards and 40.5 points — had scored at least 38 points in each of their victories. \nNot that anybody's complaining, not with the vastly improved defense playing like this. New defensive coordinator Gene Chizik's crew has held every opponent except Georgia Tech (31) to either 13 or 14 points. \nHood capped North Carolina's longest drive of the season — by yardage, distance and time elapsed — with the touchdown that finally gave the Tar Heels some breathing room. \nOn the first play of the fourth quarter, he plowed up the middle and fell as he extended his arm toward the goal line, and when the ball popped out, Virginia's Zach Bradshaw scooped it up in the end zone. The officials discussed the play and called it a touchdown, and the decision stood after a review. \nSimmons intercepted Johns on Virginia's next series, Weiler kicked a 37-yard field goal with 9:07 left and Shakeel Rashad then picked off Johns in the end zone with 5:50 to play. \nWeiler gave the Tar Heels a 16-13 lead with a 29-yarder on their first possession of the half. That came after Virginia tied it at 13 at halftime, turning two North Carolina turnovers into field goals by Ian Frye. \nFollow Joedy McCreary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joedyap \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:40:17.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
