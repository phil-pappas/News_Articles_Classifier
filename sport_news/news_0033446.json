Lee’s golf team and Fort Defiance’s Parker See punched their tickets to state golf tournaments Tuesday on separate golf courses in Harrisonburg and Williamsburg. \nLee, playing on the Kiskiack Golf Club course in Williamsburg, bested fellow Conference 36 opponent East Rockingham by 12 strokes to capture the 2A East Regional and repeat as the regional champion. Maggie Walker finished third in the eight team field with a 336 while Central Woodstock was fourth with a 340. \nMeanwhile, See qualified as an individual at the 3A West Regional at the Lakeview Golf Club. \nRobert E. Lee was led by freshman Thomas Otteni who was low medalist with a 3-over par 75. Other counters for the Leemen were Banner Robson with a 78, Jordan Plogger 79 and Gunner Cook 82. \n“A couple of our golfers did not have their best stuff today but their teammates picked them up when they had to,” Lee coach James Corbett said. \nThe Lee coach was really impressed with Otteni. \n“He has been consistent with his short game, and it paid off today,” he said. “He holed out from 135 yards on No. 9, a par-4, for an eagle. And Banner had a really steady round, and played exceptionally well. He grounded it out and posted a really good round for it.” \nOtteni didn’t have a good start on his way to being low medalist. \n“I had three bogeys on the first three holes,” he said. “After that I got a lot of pars. On No. 9 I had a good drive down the middle and holed it from 140 in. On the back nine, I tried to get as many pars as I could. I had one birdie and that was on No. 16 with a 10-foot putt.” \nOtteni and Robson were named all-region while Corbett repeated as the region coach of the year. \nThe Group 2A state tournament will be Monday and Tuesday at the Golden Eagle Golf Club in Irvington. \nMeanwhile, Fort Defiance’s See qualified for the Group 3A state tournament as one of six indiviudals at the 3A West regional at Lakeview. \nSee finished the 18 holes with a 4-over-par 76. \n“He’s been our team leader the last three years,” said Fort coach Dean Greer. “He has a great short game, but I’d like to see his scoring average come down a bit.” \nSee was the lone Indian golfer to qualify for the state. For a while it looked as if Atlee Hanger would also go. But he signed a wrong scorecard and his 75 didn’t count. \n“It’s a shame he can’t go,” Greer said. “He signed for the wrong score. It was an honest mistake in the heat of battle.” \nBesides See and five other individuals, defending champion Hidden Valley and Abington qualified as teams for the state which will be held Monday and Tuesday at the Glenrochie Country Club in Abington. \nHidden Valley edged Abington by one stroke 314-315, while Rockbridge was third with 322 and Fort fourth at 334. Then came Spotswood (336), Tunstall (338), Lord Botetourt (339) and Rustburg (363). \nIronically, Blacksburg sent four individuals to the tournament with three of them qualifying for the state. The combined total of the four was a 306 which bested all eight teams there. \nFor Fort, even if Hanger’s 75 counted, the Indians still would not have qualified as a team, missing out by five strokes. \nSee’s round of 76 over the Peak and the Lake courses would have even been better had he not bogeyed three of the last four holes. \n“I hit the ball well off the tee, but chipped and putted very poorly,” See said. “When I could putt, it wasn’t my best. And my wedge game was poor today. I was trying to kick the rust off, and it was wet.” \nSee played the Peak Course first, and was 1-over with bogeys on Nos. 3 and 4. He recorded a birdie on the par-5, No. 5. \nHeading to the nine-hole Lake Course, he parred the first three holes before burying his ball in a sand trap on the par-3, No. 4 and settling for a bogey. On the par-5, No. 5, he was on the green in two shots, missed a 20-foot eagle and settled for a birdie to go back to 1-over. But he bogeyed three of the next four holes to finish 4-over. \nFort also got an 82 from Devon Payne. \n”I could have putted better,” he said. “But my iron game saved me today.” \nPayne had one birdie in his round, a 14-footer on the Peak Course No. 3. \nAlex Gough checked in with an 86. ”The course was very wet and I couldn’t hit a green today,” he said. \n”I’m really proud of our team,” Greer said. ”We had a really great year. We ended up five shots from where we needed to be. I knew it was going to be close.” 191 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/2015/10/06/lee-wins-regional-forts-see-qualifies-state/73490258/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:02:31.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
