First Half Highlights: Montclair attempted to fake a punt and were caught, giving Seton Hall Prep the ball on the 26-yard line. They made the best of their opportunity when Dylan Badger scored from three yards out for a 6-0 lead after missing the extra point, as the first quarter ended. Two plays into the second quarter, Mike Mughetto picked off a deflected pass and returned it 30 yards for the score and the Pirates were up 13-0. Montclair needed to make something happen and did just that. On third and thirteen from their 49, Tarrin Earle found DJ Williams for 46 yards for first and goal from the 5. After having a touchdown called back, Earle found Elijah J Robinson on a fade in the right corner of the end zone and it was 13-7. Montclair then started on their 31 and on third and ten, Earle found Williams for a 59-yard score to pull in front, 14-13. Seton Hall Prep had the ball at mid-field and were stopped on fourth and one for no gain, giving Montclair the ball on their own 48. It only took one play, as Earle to Robinson hooked up for a 52 yard score, putting them in front, 21-13, with three minutes left in the half. Second Half Highlights: After forcing Montclair to punt, Seton Hall Prep put themselves in good position on their first two plays: James McGuire taking a handoff for 26 yards, followed by Connor Merklinger going 24 yards for a first and goal from the seven. A Montclair penalty brought a first goal at the three, but Montclair's defense was unyielding and capped it off when Williams tackled Badger at the two on fourth down for a one yard loss. Montclair turned around, getting themselves away from the goal line with two Daniel Webb runs for first downs to the 30-yard line. At that point, Earle found Robinson down the right sideline, where he cut to the middle of the field for the 70 yard score to make it 28-13. Seton Hall came down the field with four first downs to set up a first and goal from the one, which Zach Keller took in for the score and it was 28-19 as the quarter ended. The key play was a 31-yard screen pass to Dwayne Warren. Montclair marched down the field, with a steady diet of Daniel Webb running the ball eleven times. They had the chance to extend the lead, but a touchdown was called back and they turned it over on downs. The Prep came down the field again, with a first and goal from the one when Keller found Tyree Chapman. After several tries, they scored on fourth down when Badger ran through the line to make it 28-26 with 2:43 left. Montclair was forced to punt and the Prep had 60 yards to go with eleven seconds left. Keller found Warren for ten yards and the first down, followed by another connection between the two. As Keller scrambled around, Warren got behind the Montclair defenders, catching the ball, but being brought down on the three as time expired. Play of The Game: The Williams stop short of the goal line on fourth down to keep Seton Hall Prep out of the end zone. Game Balls: The trio of Earle, Robinson, and Williams for making the plays. Webb didn't look great in the stat column, but he gained many tough yards. Audibles: Montclair head coach John Fiore - \"During the bye, we said we were 0-0 and the season starts today. It's a big load off our shoulders to get the first win and even better, we kept the lead. They did a great job of taking Daniel Webb away, but that also left our receivers open. The future is bright for us and it starts right now. We have to get ready for West Orange Friday night and get ready quick.\"Montclair WR Elijah J Robinson - \"Today was really big for both me and the team. This feels great after starting off 0-4. It's a big win; we just had to win this game. We've been trying to pick everyone else up.\"Montclair WR/DB DJ Williams - \"When I made the stop on fourth down from the one-yard line, I just thought I had to make the stop and we can't lose this game. On my touchdown, it was my job to get the safety to back off. Once I caught the ball, nobody was going to catch me. It feels good to win again, but we're not done.\"Montclair RB Daniel Webb - \"Everything feels back to normal. We just wanted to keep going and if we get in the playoffs, anything can happen. I wasn't frustrated by not getting room to run at all: we wanted to win.\" FEATURED PRODUCT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:09:12.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
