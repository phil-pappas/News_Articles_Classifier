A lot of good habits,\" Aldoff said. \"We've only practiced three days. I thought everybody did real well. Decisions are going to be very hard.\" \nAll teams in the Southern Professional Hockey League must trim training camp rosters to 22 players Sunday, then 18 on Wednesday for the season-opening weekend. The Ice Flyers will leave Wednesday for Peoria, Ill. where they open on the road next Friday and Saturday against the Peoria Rivermen. \nAfter two scoreless periods, all the scoring Saturday was in the final 20 minutes. Filip Bjork scored the game's first goal on a wrist shot just inside the blue line with 13:39 left. Joe Caveney, who helped the Ice Flyers to a pair of SPHL championships, along with newcomer Patrik Divjak had assists. It became a 2-0 lead for the Ice Flyers a few minutes later when Ryan Kesti got a bounce off the boards and turned into a breakaway goal. \nLouisiana scored with 9:19 left on a deflection and the IceGators pulled goaltender Matic Marinsek with 90 seconds left for an extra attacker. The Ice Flyers did not allow a good scoring chance and skated off with the win. The two teams will next meet on Oct. 30 in the Ice Flyers home opener at the Bay Center. \n\"It was a well rounded game,\" Aldoff said. \"A good game to evaluate as much as you could.\" \nThe Ice Flyers outshot Louisiana 39-31 Saturday. Former Boston College goaltender Brad Barone played the entire game for the Ice Flyers with the other two goalies, Andrew Walsh (who was in uniform) and Jimmy Sarjeant, dealing with slight injuries. \n\"I thought Brad handled himself very well,\" Aldoff said. \nBy resting players he knows will be on his team, Aldoff was able to take longer looks at guys he must choose from to eventually reach a season-opening roster. \n\"I know what those guys can do. They played here,\" said Aldoff of his returning scoring leaders. \"I wanted to see what some other guys can do..We can't keep everybody. So we have to sit here and evaluate some things and think over some things.. It is a tough side of the business but it's part of the business. \n\"We saw guys step up and be leaders from last year and some new guys step up, so we have real, good core group of people in that dressing room and it's nice to see.\" \nICE FLYERS TIMELINE \nSunday -- All teams in SPHL must trim roster from maximum 30 players allowed in training camp to 22. \nWednesday -- Teams must submit season-opening roster. The Ice Flyers will leave later in day for Peoria, Ill. \nF riday -and Saturday -- The Ice Flyers face Peoria Rivermen in back-to-back games to open season on road. \nOct. 30 - - The Ice Flyers play their home opener against IceGators at Bay Center.
