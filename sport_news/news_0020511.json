The nexus between some doctors of the city and towns of the district and rural medical practitioners and private medical practitioners is growing stronger by the day. Doctors are allegedly relying on these RMPs by “offering commissions” to the tune of 20 per cent to 30 per cent on the bill charged to patients. The district has over 7,000 RMPs. Scores of doctors belonging to the district allegedly sponsored funds to the tune of `70 lakh for organising a meeting for thanking public representatives as the state government sanctioned `40 lakh in order to train the RMPs as paramedics. Seven doctors of the city erected huge flex posters inviting participants to the meeting held in the city recently. Indian Medical Assoc-iation Karimnagar chapter president Dr Y. Narendra said that show-cause notices were served on the seven doctors and a complaint was lodged with authorities of MCI. “The doctors gave their explanations which were forwarded to IMA state president Dr K. Shyamsundar for taking necessary action,” he said. “We serve people of villages. We treat patients of rural areas without forcing them to pay fees. We have cordial relations with people. Our patients request us to accompany them to a hospital. Few doctors offer some amount to us as a token of gratitude. A section of organisations are harassing us for accepting incentives from doctors,” said D. Manohar, president of Karimnagar district RMP and PMP welfare association. “Who has allowed them to practice medicine? Doctors cannot solicit these touts by any means. It is unethical according to the code of ethics of the MCI, the apex body that sets norms and guidelines for medical services in the country. It amounts to a major violation of the code of conduct of the MCI,” said Dr K. Ramesh Reddy, member of MCI. Lok Satta Udyama Samstha lodged a complaint with the DGP and MCI’s state wing against RMPs for using the prefix doctor before their names. N. Srinivas, district president of LSUS said that they would bring this issue to the notice of the SP. No of RMPs and PMPs in district: 7,000. Around 100 RMPs treat patients in 57 mandals of the district, according to information provided by Karimnagar district RMP and PMP welfare association. This means, the state has nearly 70,000. About 1.50 lakh quacks can be found in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Quacks usually do not register their clinics with concerned department, violating norms. All kinds of clinical establishments from the public and private sectors, including single doctor clinics should register with district medical and health officer by paying fees, according to the Andhra Pradesh Allopathic Private Medical Care Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Rules, 2007. The quacks prescribe scheduled drugs, flouting the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and Rules 1945. The scheduled drugs cannot be prescribed by anyone other than qualified doctors, as per the Act.
