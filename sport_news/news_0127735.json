Thank God I was there again. \n\"I believe it was a fair result. We were much better in the second half and we created chances. They had chances to go ahead as well, but fortunately we were able to defend those. \" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:19.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
