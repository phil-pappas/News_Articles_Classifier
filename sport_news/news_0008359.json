In the aftermath of Tuesday's loss, the Jaguars seem intent that the loss to Arkansas State won't define its season. \n\"There is no blame on anybody,\" head coach Joey Jones said. \"We're going to stick together as a family and we'll come through this. We just played a very good football team. We're not happy we lost; you're never happy about losing. But there's a lot of things we can build on from this ball game. The guys played hard and I can live with that.\" \nSaid linebacker Blake Dees, \"It's hard to take the loss, especially when you're up late in the game. It hurts. But we can bounce back against the next opponent, and that's what we're going to do.\" \nThat next opponent is Texas State, which is 1-4 this season and had a bye this week. The Jaguars travel to San Marcos, Texas, to meet Dennis Franchione's Bobcats at 6 p.m. Oct. 24. \nWhat frame of mind South Alabama will be in by the time of that game remains to be seen. After three days off, the Jaguars return to the practice field on Saturday. \n\"It's heartbreaking that we didn't win, but we can learn from it,\" wide receiver Danny Woodson said. \"We just have to practice hard next week on our next opponent. We know what we have to correct.\" \nSouth Alabama is 0-4 all-time against Arkansas State, losing by a combined score of 94-41 the last two seasons. The Jaguars appeared poised to end that slide on Tuesday night, leading 31-20 after Gerald Everett's touchdown run with 13:12 to play. \nThe next five minutes were a dizzying barrage of Red Wolves touchdowns, one on a pass, one on a run and two one defense — a fumble recovery in the end zone after a sack of Jaguars quarterback Cody Clements, followed by an interception return. The South Alabama defense allowed just 342 yards, holding Red Wolves quarterback Fredi Knighten relatively in check. \n\"I thought the defense played well, played hard,\" head coach Joey Jones said. \"They were just on the field a little too long. We gave them some turnovers and some points, and it kind of got away from us.\" \nNo one took the loss harder than Clements, who threw for a season-best 272 yards and three touchdowns, but also was directly responsible for four of the Jaguars' five turnovers. Three of those came in an eight-play span during Arkansas State's shocking 29-point outburst. \nNevertheless, Clements said the Jaguars proved there are a legitimate contender in the Sun Belt race. \n\"You can take something out of it,\" Clements said. \"That team was one of the best in our conference. We're right up there. We're not lower than anyone else. When we play our football, we're a hard team to beat.\" \nSouth Alabama came out of Tuesday's game with a handful of new injuries, including starting tailback Xavier Johnson (bruised heel) and offensive guard Cameron Blankenship (knee). Blankenship is sidelined for at least 2-3 weeks after undergoing knee surgery on Thursday. \nIn addition, outside linebacker Akeem Lewis was ejected for targeting in the fourth quarter against Arkansas State. By rule, he must sit out the first half of the Texas State game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:22:54.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
