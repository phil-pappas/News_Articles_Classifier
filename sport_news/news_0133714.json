I like it,\" the Astana team leader, fresh from winning his maiden Tour of Lombardy on Sunday, added: \"it's still too early to make a decision yet.\"\nHeld over 21 stages from May 6-29, next year's race totals 3383km and features six mountaintop or uphill finishes and four days in the thin air of the high mountains.\nAfter the opening time trial of 9.8km in Apeldoorn and two further, flat stages in the Netherlands the peloton transfers to the 'sole' of the Italian peninsula where the race resumes on stage four at Catanzaro.\nThe first foray into the high mountains comes on stage 14 over 210 km from Alpago to Corvara - one of three stages on the race given a five-star difficulty rating.\nThe next day's stage, a 10.8km uphill time trial from Castelrotto to Alpe di Siusi, has an average gradient of 8.3 percent.\nA further three days will be spent in the high mountains, on stages 16, 19 and 20, taking in trips across the border to neighbouring France which hosts the summit finish of stage 19 in Risoul.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:54:31.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
