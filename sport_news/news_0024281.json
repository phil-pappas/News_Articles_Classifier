You can read Detroit Bad Boys blogs every Friday and find Sean on Twitter at @sean_corp .\nStan Van Gundy has worked hard not only to reshape the Detroit Pistons roster in his image, but to increase competitiveness from the first man to the 15th.\nThrough four preseason games, it's not just stars Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond who are exciting the Pistons fan base, but less heralded players like rookie Stanley Johnson and NBA vagabond Reggie Bullock. Instead of a mish-mashed collection of parts, Detroit finally seems like it has a team that fits and enough talent to make roster decisions difficult and minute allocations painful.\nIf Van Gundy decides Johnson deserves minutes right away and Bullock eventually claws his way into the regular rotation, it could mean Cartier Martin gets released, and Jodie Meeks and Anthony Tolliver could see reduced roles.\nJohnson was supposed to be good eventually, but he's impressed right out of the gate. The lottery pick currently leads the team in minutes and is second among all NBA rookies in both points and minutes per game. He's had his ups and downs , and he'll get even lower once the grind of a real regular season hits, but he seems poised to grab a place in rotation from the beginning.\nWhile Johnson, by virtue of being a lottery pick, came to the team with high expectations, Bullock was practically an afterthought. He was a late first-round pick just two years ago and shined at North Carolina, but when you're on your third team in two years, the shine tends to wear off just a little. Most assumed he was simply a throw-in as part of the Marcus Morris trade, it seems Van Gundy believed he had a bona fide prospect on his hands.\nBullock has turned heads throughout preseason , doing exactly the things Van Gundy preaches for his players â€“ playing hard-nosed defense all the time, shooting the lights out from the perimeter and always being a willing passer.\nIn Detroit's 114-91 win over the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, Bullock was 7 of 8 from the field, 3 of 4 from the three-point line and had four assists.\nOnce thought to be on the roster bubble, Bullock seems to have secured his spot, perhaps at the expense of Martin, who has seen little action in the preseason.\nIf Johnson becomes the primary small forward off the bench, the 6-foot-9 Morris is likely to slide to the power forward spot. However, if Morris becomes the team's backup power forward that leaves little playing time for Anthony Tolliver.\nBullock, meanwhile, could see some time at small forward as well as minutes at shooting guard, where his defense will be in high demand. That means, however, that Meeks could see a reduced role going forward. Last off-season, Detroit shocked many NBA observers by inking Meeks to a three-year, $19 million deal. Just more than a year later, Meeks is going to have to fight in a crowded backcourt for both minutes and shots.\nThen again, having more quality players than minutes available is the kind of problem only good teams tend to have, and it's the kind of problem the Pistons fans have been craving for the past six years.", "external_links": ["http://www.detroitbadboys.com/", "https://twitter.com/sean_corp"], "published": "2015-10-16T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:24:01.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
