We were focused on Ohio State. … You really can't focus on that. It really doesn't matter.” Maryland coach Randy Edsall abruptly exits postgame news conference \nCoach Randy Edsall talks with the media after Maryland's loss to Ohio State. \nCoach Randy Edsall talks with the media after Maryland's loss to Ohio State. See more videos \nThat refrain echoed among Hills, defensive tackle Quinton Jefferson and middle linebacker Jermaine Carter Jr. Edsall declined to explain how he addressed his team regarding reports he would be fired —“Those things are really private, OK? Between me and my team, OK?”— and the players said they simply focused on the game plan and preparing for Ohio State. \nInto the third quarter, Maryland appeared to be on the brink of a monumental upset and Edsall's first victory over a ranked opponent in 12 tries with the Terps. After taking a 7-0 lead on a 52-yard touchdown pass from Hills to wide receiver D.J. Moore, the Buckeyes scored 21 straight points on rushing touchdowns from quarterback J.T. Barrett and running back Ezekiel Elliott, and a pass from quarterback Cardale Jones to quarterback-turned-wide receiver Braxton Miller. \nBut the Terps, who seemed unable to answer similar situations in their previous three losses against Bowling Green, West Virginia and Michigan, landed a few counterpunches of their own. Buckeyes kicker Jack Willoughby missed a 44-yard field goal that would've put his team up 24-7 near halftime. Two plays later, Hills bolted 75 yards through the Ohio State secondary to set up a 3-yard rushing score that cut the deficit to 21-14. \nOn the opening drive of the second half, Maryland strung together a nine-play, 69-yard possession capped by a 4-yard touchdown run up the middle by Hills to tie the game at 21. \n“Guys just saw a great opportunity, and they wanted to take advantage of it,” said Hills, who completed 10 of 27 passes for 133 yards, a touchdown, two interceptions and four sacks. “You don't get a bigger stage than this.” \nOhio State's offensive weapons overwhelmed the Maryland defense down the stretch. Jones finished 21 of 28 passing for 291 yards and two touchdowns, while Elliott rushed for 106 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries. Barrett, who served primarily as Ohio State's quarterback in the red zone, scored three times. Four Buckeyes wide receivers had at least four catches. \nAnd with 28 second-half points, Ohio State left no doubt about the result. The only question left was a simple one with a complicated ending that could play out in the coming days. \n“Do you feel like you know who your coach is going to be the next time you play?” Jefferson was asked. \n“I'm not really worried about that,” Jefferson said. “I'm just here to play defense, so whoever's the coach, I'm going to play my hardest for them. That doesn't affect me. I'm not really worried about that right now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:29:10.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
