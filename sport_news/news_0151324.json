But he isn't worried. \n\"You can't be. When you start playing mind games with yourself, that's when you're not at your best on the ice,\" Schlemko told NJ Advance Media. \"You have to just kind of block out that part of it mentally and do your job.\" \nCoach John Hynes suggested the lack of playing time hasn't hurt the 28-year-old defenseman. \n\"Not much. We've liked him when we thought he played well in Philly and we've like him for a couple practices prior to that,\" Hynes explained. \"So fortunately for him and us, he has some experience. \n\"He's been in meetings. He seems like he understands what we want to do that way. Similar to a guy like Patrik Elias, who's got some experience. A lot of times those guys can pick things up in meetings and video without sometimes having to run through them so much. So as of now, it looks like he's in a pretty good spot.\" \nRELATED: What did Lou Lamoriello say about his last years with Devils? \nKennedy may be in a stickier situation. A training camp tryout, Kennedy played three preseason games (no goals, two assists) before having to deal with personal matters that have kept him away from the team. \n\"We're still waiting for him. He has a personal thing going on with his family. We don't have a definitive answer yet,\" Hynes said. \"It's a completely personal thing. We're trying to deal with him in the most humanistic way to make sure things are good there before we get into either contracts or what the hockey situation is.\"We had the final two games. We think he's had a good camp, but it's one of those situations where you can't move forward either way because you're not sure where either party stands yet.\" \nThe Devils have to make four more roster cuts. Putting Elias (right knee) in IR will make three moves necessary. \nSchlemko admits he hasn't accomplished what he'd like to have done in camp. \n\"Well, no. I had two practices and just the one game so far,\" he said. \"I felt I got progressively better over the game, but I want to improve again tonight. I would've liked to skate all camp, especially coming in as a new guy, but you play with the hand you're dealt and do the best you can.\" \nHis chances at staying on the NHL roster? \n\"I'm not sure. That's not up to me to figure out,\" Schlemko said. \"That's up to the coaches and management. I just have to go out there and go hard.\" \nDefenseman Marc-Andre Gragnani (hip flexor) skated this morning. \n\"He should be ready to roll early next week,\" Hynes said. \nDevils' roster: \nGoaltenders (2): Keith Kinkaid, Cory Schneider. Defensemen (9): Eric Gelinas, Marc-Andre Gragnani, Andy Greene, Seth Helgeson, Adam Larsson, Jon Merrill, John Moore, David Schlemko, Damon Severson. Forwards (16): Reid Boucher, Mike Cammalleri, Patrik Elias, Stephen Gionta, Adam Henrique, Jacob Josefson, Sergey Kalinin, Tyler Kennedy, Stefan Matteau, Kyle Palmieri, Tuomo Ruutu, Lee Stempniak, Jiri Tlusty, Jordin Tootoo, Pavel Zacha, Travis Zajac. \nRich Chere may be reached at rchere@njadvancemedia.com .
