BolinArkansas News Bureau • ebolin@arkansasnews.com \nFAYETTEVILLE — It’s been almost 10 years since Arkansas beat Alabama. That’s part of the reason the ideas around the University of Arkansas campus are so grand. \nOverwhelming joy and a sense of legitimacy would be injected into nearly the entire state if Arkansas pulled unlikely and beat Alabama. Social media, awash with opinions as varied as the Razorbacks’ results over the last six seasons, would galvanize. To beat Alabama is to slay the giant, it’s thought. \nWhether those ideas are too big or overstated is up to the individual. One thing is certain, though, an Arkansas win over the Crimson Tide today would put the team back on-track toward a bowl. \nIt’s just a matter of overcoming that losing streak. \n“Players are here for a maximum of four or five years, so they haven’t been around for all of them (the eight straight losses),” Arkansas coach Bret Bielema said. “You try to focus on the now. As a program we’ve had to break a lot of those streaks unfortunately, but hopefully we are going to start building some of those on our own.” \nThat consecutive-loss stretch was nearly overcome last year. Arkansas, at the time, had no business holding a top-five Alabama team to 14 points. A fumble on the goal and a missed field goal were haunting as the Razorbacks lost, 14-13, at Donald W. Reynolds Stadium. \nThe last time Arkansas was at Bryant-Denny Stadium it was a bit more lopsided. Alabama won, 52-0. Pundits and Las Vegas think the expected outcome will be somewhere in between that 52 and the 1. The Crimson Tide are favored by a 16 to 17 points, depending on the book. \nThe rosters stack favorably, though, for the Razorbacks. Consider Arkansas returns a good chunk of its team from last year’s bunch that lost to Alabama by one and Alabama lost its best offensive player and there is reason to believe Arkansas could break the streak. Figure, too, where Alabama excels is where Arkansas excels – stopping the run. \nReverse it, though, and Arkansas doesn’t have any edges when they go to offense. Arkansas is the top third-down offense in the SEC, but Alabama is the top third-down defense. Alabama has the second best rushing defense and fourth best passing defense. \nUltimately, it could mean another low-scoring game. \n“Alabama is Alabama,” Allen said. “It doesn’t matter who comes and goes. They’re going to be very disciplined on defense. They’re not going to make a lot of violations or mistakes on ‘D.’” \nArkansas running back Alex Collins, who has run for 150 yards or more in three straight games, will be pivotal. If he is having success running, then Allen will see a more stacked box and throw the ball to wide Drew Morgan, who, himself, has two straight 100-yard receiving games. \nBut offense is a chicken-and-egg situation. Does success in the ground game open the passing game or does passing game success open the rushing attack? If there is anyone on the Arkansas team who can figure it out, it’s offensive coordinator Dan Enos. At least, Enos was tongue-in-cheek about that earlier in the week. He was a quarterback at Michigan State, as a player, when Alabama coach Nick Saban was the Spartans defensive coordinator. \n“I haven’t talked to him, I think, since the last time he yelled at me at practice as a scout-team player,” Enos said. \nStill, Enos’ offense has the potential to provide problems. After a mediocre first couple games, the balance has returned to the Arkansas system in the last three. The difference between yards passing and yards rushing hasn’t been greater than 100 in each those games. And it’s that sort of spread Bielema has preached since the spring. \nIt isn’t Alabama spread, though. Before the season began Bielema spoke with fans and donors at the Springdale Convention Center. His comments about Auburn - “I hate Auburn” - drew the most notice at the time. Moments before that, seconds even, he made the statement of what he expects for Arkansas football. He invoked the Crimson Tide. It was the same statement he made upon being hired. \n“I came here to beat Alabama,” he said in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:13:46.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
