UMass senior Tajae Sharpe needs 190 receiving yards to pass Adrian Zullo (2,892 from 1998-2002) and become the program’s career leader. Sharpe also needs two receiving touchdowns to tie career leader Chip Mitchell (1986-89) with 14. Sharpe’s 39-game streak with at least one catch is the third-longest active streak behind Arizona State’s D.J. Foster (45), and Toledo’s Alonzo Russell (42).\n2. Get a stopwatch! Eight of the Minutemen’s 12 touchdown drives in 2015 required two minutes or less. The 66.7-percent rate ties UMass with Baylor at No. 2 nationally, behind only Troy.\n3. Did someone say offense? UMass is averaging 445 total yards, though that pales in comparison to the Falcons, who are averaging a whopping 580.6 yards per game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:17:47.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
