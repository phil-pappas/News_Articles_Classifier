Another week, it's an angry driver shoving a racing rival. This week, it's burnouts. There's always some drama in NASCAR, particularly at Chase time.\nKevin Harvick's celebratory smokescreen burnout after he dominated at Dover International Speedway last Sunday has aroused suspicions that he purposely made contact with the interior wall and blew out his tires to make the postrace job of NASCAR inspectors more difficult.\nPredictably, Harvick's reaction to such criticism was \"Who, me?\"\nDuring a media session Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C., previewing the first race in the Chase Contenders Round on Saturday night, Chaser Denny Hamlin said: \"You don't want to discredit anyone's win, because what (Harvick) did was really, really impressive. But all the other competitors, whoever doesn't win each week, wants to make sure they're on a level playing field with whoever did win. I would like to see some way of ensuring our cars stay intact for (NASCAR tech inspection).\"\nMore coverage WATCH: Latest sports videos BUY: Philly sports gear DISCUSS: Join our sports forums Another Chaser, Brad Keselowski, said it's common for drivers to damage their cars.\n\"I've definitely blown tires out,\" the 2012 champion said. \"I think every driver has done things to do some kind of damage to their car.\"\nHarvick, acting as innocent as a child on Christmas Eve, said he didn't remember hitting the wall at the Delaware racetrack.\nEver since NASCAR's first race, deception has been part of the game. NASCAR passes a rule and immediately crew chiefs gleefully plot ways around it to make their cars go faster.\nFrom the Dover press box in Turn 1, I couldn't tell whether Harvick's car banged the wall. It looked like a typical rubber-screechin' burnout to me.\nChasers too cautious? The Chase format undoubtedly has created interest in the Sprint Cup Series' season homestretch. Just check Dale Earnhardt Jr. passing Jamie McMurray on the last restart at Dover for third place. Even though McMurray finished fourth, he was eliminated from the Contenders Round. Earnhardt and McMurray were tied for the final transfer spot, but Earnhardt advanced because his third-place finish was the highest by either in the Challenger Round.\nWhat the Chase also has done, however, is produce cautious racing by several Chasers. Drivers who realize they cannot win just stay in position, knowing they'll advance in the Chase.\nOnly three drivers led at some point at Dover. Harvick seized the lead and controlled the race because he had to win to advance. Kyle Busch also was in a precarious position before Dover, so he also surged to the front. Matt Kenseth, the only other race leader at Dover, started on the pole as the points leader after qualifying was rained out. Kenseth knew he was locked into the Contenders Round, so after he lost the lead to Harvick, he was content to race along behind the leader. He finished seventh.\nJeff Gordon didn't give his fans much to get excited about in his final race at Dover. Realizing his Chevrolet wasn't capable over overtaking Harvick's Chevy, Gordon stayed around the top 10 because he knew he would move on to the Contenders Round.\nDover in the dark? NASCAR flirted with a shortened event at Dover because the race didn't start until 2:50 p.m. Starting times for Chase races are determined by NBC Sports. Since Sunday afternoon races compete with popular NFL games, the later race starts are aimed at giving racing fans the opportunity to watch some NFL action before racing begins.\nHad there been a long delay in the race at Dover, which has no lights, darkness could've led to the AAA 375 instead of 400. The race ended about 6:10 p.m.\nI thought I'd find fans upset by the later starting time, who would end up getting home later in the day. Instead, fans I spoke with were fine with it.\n\"I'd like to see it earlier, but I'm OK with it,\" said Chris Rafferty, who drove to Delaware's capital city from Rhode Island with Tracy Wright on Saturday. They attended the previous week's race at New Hampshire: These are real fans! Wisely, they weren't motoring home Sunday night.\nSuzanne Shaw, a Jeff Gordon fan from Bear, Del., attended Dover races with her father.\n\"I remember when the races here were 500 miles; that was a long day,\" she said. \"I don't mind (later starts). It gives us more time to walk around.\"\nThere's also more time for souvenir and concession sales.\nThis week's race Bank of America 500\nCharlotte Motor Speedway, Concord, N.C.\nWhen: Saturday, 7 p.m.\nTV/Radio: NBC10/WNPV (1440-AM)\nCourse: 1.5-mile oval\nDistance: 334 laps/500 miles\nForecast: showers likely, mid-60s\nLast year’s winner: Kevin Harvick\nLast year’s pole: Harvick, 197.621 mph\nTrack qualifying record: Kurt Busch, 198.771 mph (October 2014)\nTrack facts: For the next three-race Contenders Round events, Chasers must win to automatically advance, as they did in the opening Challengers Round.
