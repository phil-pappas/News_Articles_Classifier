He shouldn't have to go through all of it over and over again.\"\nThe athlete, whose lower legs were amputated when he was a baby, was freed in line with South African sentencing guidelines that say non-dangerous prisoners should spend only one-sixth of a custodial sentence behind bars.\nAPPEAL LOOMS\nProsecutors argue that the verdict should be one of murder because Pistorius must have known that the person behind the door could be killed. Their appeal is due to be heard on Nov. 3.\nThe state will argue that the trial judge misinterpreted parts of the law. A murder conviction would result in a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.\nA panel of five judges will hear the appeal, which Pistorius is not obliged to attend. They could either reject the prosecution's appeal, order a retrial or convict Pistorius of murder themselves, legal experts say.\nParole conditions already announced include that Pistorius, a gun enthusiast, must undergo psychotherapy and is not allowed to possess a firearm.\nSouth Africa has one of the world's highest rates of violent crime.\nSteenkamp's family have said they are unhappy with Pistorius's sentence and questioned the verdict in public in August.\nTania Koen, a lawyer for the Steenkamp family which has opposed early parole, told state broadcaster SABC last week: \"Nothing is changed in their lives. Reeva is not coming back.\"\nLouise Ferreira, a feminist activist and writer, was critical of how short a time he had spent behind bars in view of the gravity of the crime.\n\"He might not have been found guilty of murder, but it was yet another instance of a South African woman killed by an intimate partner, and I don't believe the time he spent in prison reflects the severity either of his crime or the epidemic of violence against women,\" she said.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:16:42.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
