As National Teen Driving Safety Week is October 18-24, it’s the perfect time for teens and their parents to discuss the dangers new drivers face so they can make safe and responsible decisions.\nYoung drivers between 15 and 19 years old were involved in nearly 15% (128,349) of all traffic crashes from 2012-2014. Of those crashes, a teen driver was at-fault 73% of the time. These crashes resulted in 282 fatalities and 41,311 injuries.\nWhile the causes of those crashes may vary, speed-related factors contributed to 59% of crashes caused by teens. Another 20% of crashes were caused by failure to yield, running a red light or running a stop sign.\n“Teen drivers need to realize that poor decisions while driving now can stay with them for the rest of their lives,” said Lieutenant Jerrod A. Savidge Bowling Green Post Commander. “That is why responsibility, awareness and safety are so important for our youngest drivers.”\nWhile education and awareness are extremely important, the Patrol also wants to change driver behavior through traffic enforcement.\nTeen drivers are encouraged to plan ahead when traveling to eliminate rushing to their destination. They are also reminded that safety belts save lives and they should encourage everyone in their vehicle to buckle up, every time.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/driverdriving.jpg", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*264/driverdriving.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:20:35.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
