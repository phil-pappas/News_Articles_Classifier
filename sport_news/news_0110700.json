Moore Jr. on her July 31 guilty plea to stealing $232,000 from the court as part of a scheme in which the government said she stole more than $750,000 over a three-year period.\nWithers’ filing was an attempt to convince Moore to sentence her below the 41-51 month guideline range he said is recommended in the probation office’ pre-sentencing report.\nAccording to Withers, Birge started work in the court when she was 19 and after a leave with her first child, returned in 1982 and remained there until December.\nIn addition to “a cascade of family responsibilities overwhelmed Kim as well,” Birge suffered from “a constellation of health problems that extended back for decades,” Withers said. After a series of surgeries, she “suffered real and significant pain.\n“Ultimately, Kim became addicted to the prescription opiods she was taking for pain management,” Withers said. “Kim became seriously addicted to video game gambling in convenience stores both near her work and home.\n“When Kim was unable to continue to fund her gambling with her funds, she started embezzling monies form Probate Court. Unfortunately, for gambling addicts, there is no bottom, until the money runs dry,” Withers said, adding that it led to Birge’s abuse of her position of trust with the court .\n“Kim found herself unable to stop her conduct.”\nWithers included a number of letters of support from lawyers and others, adding that “She fears that her criminal conduct will define her legacy” of more than 30 years “of being a stalwart in the courthouse.”\n“A lengthy term of incarceration will truly serve no useful purpose and will deprive the community, as well as her family, of someone who can still become, again, a noble force for good,” Withers said. We respectfully request that this court ‘impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, when sentencing Mrs. Birge.”\nIn her guilty plea, Birge told Moore she had abused her position with the court and accepted full responsibility for her actions.\n“I opened and closed certificates of deposit belonging to other people for my own benefit. I take full and complete responsibility for my actions, and I humbly ask for forgiveness from anyone I have hurt.\nBirge, standing with Withers, told Moore that “I want this court to know that no one knew anything about my shortcomings and indiscretions. ... I have let my family and my friends down. This is not something that I take lightly.”\nThe government charged Birge used the U.S. mail and private commercial carriers as part of the scheme, using money from court accounts for her own benefit.\nUnder the terms of her negotiated plea with the government, Birge pleaded guilty to count three of a five-count indictment, charging her with mail fraud and federal program fraud in the scheme the government said lasted between January 2011 and November 2011.\nThe count to which she pleaded charged that between Sept. 21, 2011, and Oct. 18, 2011, a check for $232,000 payable to the Chatham County Probate Court was among the checks she used for her own use.\nThe government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts, but probation officers can consider the entire indictment in arriving at advisory sentencing guidelines for Moore’s consideration.\nU.S. Secret Service Agent Grant Rothschild testified that the Probate Court had accounts in South State Bank (formerly The Savannah Bank) and First Chatham Bank and that $750,000 was withdrawn from the accounts by checks made out to cash and used for Birge’s benefit.\nThe indictment charges that Birge stole “United States currency totaling approximately $767,219.”\nWhen asked by Moore whether any audits of court accounts were done, Rothschild said an audit had been conducted several years earlier then one by the government and a second by an outside firm authorized by Chatham County after the discovery of problems in the court’s accounts.\nBirge was named May 18 in a five-count indictment that included four counts of mail fraud by using the mail to defraud Chatham County out of more than $700,000 between January 2011 and November 2014 and then using the cash for her own benefit.\nA fifth count charged federal program fraud. It alleged she stole about $767,218 between Jan. 1, 2014, and Dec. 31, 2014, from Chatham County, money that involved a federal grant.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Scarlett Nokes said the plea agreement included the government’s recommending sentencing at the lower end of the sentencing guidelines, but with no sentence being promised by the government.\nShe also said the agreement did not limit any restitution ordered as part of the sentence is not limited to the sum pleaded to, but may include the full amount alleged in the indictment.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14438498_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14438498_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:14:04.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
