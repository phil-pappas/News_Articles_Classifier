Some patrons hunched over barbecue sandwiches and silently tended to the task at hand. On the few unoccupied tables rested signs that said \"Reserved.\"\n\"We've been getting calls for reservations since last week,\" said Greg Heidel, manager at Sheffield's. \"We don't even take reservations.\"\nAnd yet, a Cubs playoff run calls for some exceptions. Simply put, it's been an extraordinary season for many Wrigleyville restaurants and bars, rising on the tide of the team's success and pushing past sales numbers of previous years. The Cubs have built it, the people have come, and those people have spent lots of money on food and drink.\nThe overall economic impact to the city of the Cubs' postseason run is basically nil, according to an academic study. But as the playoffs come home to the North Side for the first time since 2008, Cubs and Cardinals fans will descend on local restaurants like they haven't in years. And, with a cautious eye toward the possible need for heightened security, restaurateurs are welcoming them with arms flung open.\n\"It's been an exceptional season for the business,\" said Heidel, who wore a bandanna tied around his forehead as he hustled behind the bar before last week's wild-card game.\nIt's the best Cubs season, business-wise, in Heidel's eight years at Sheffield's, he said, though the recent Blackhawks championship seasons still set the bar. Compared with last season, Heidel said sales are up at least 20 percent, with the largest increase coming in July and August, typically a time by which the Cubs have usually fallen from contention.\nHeidel said there have been discussions about limiting the menu and ramping up security in preparation for the playoff crowds.\n\"In the past, the joke was always the Cubs are out of it by the All-Star break,\" Heidel said. \"Now it's starting to take on the Blackhawks phenomenon, where people are showing up in large numbers just to watch the game on TV.\"\nOn the morning after the Cubs victory in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Nick Lindmark's voice was still thick with sleep. He closed Dimo's Pizza on Clark Street, where he's assistant manager, and didn't leave work until about 4 a.m.\nDimo's is a late-night, by-the-slice option for Wrigleyville carousers, offering specialty items like pizza topped with macaroni and cheese, along with more traditional options. After Cubs ace Jake Arrieta finished his complete game and police shut down streets around Wrigley Field, Lindmark saw some \"rowdy\" patrons but nothing too out of hand.\n\"In Wrigleyville, you never know what you're going to get,\" Lindmark said.\nDimo's is a BYOB establishment. Lindmark said they've considered the need for more security for the playoffs, like another employee or two in the lobby \"surveying the scene,\" and possibly cutting off alcohol brought in at a certain point.\nBut the Cubs' winning ways have mostly meant more money. Dimo's operates an \"open-book finance\" system that allows all employees to see the daily sales forecast and results as a form of motivation, he said. Those goals have steadily risen as the season's progressed and the store's been busting its own sales records.\nIn April, Dimo's might have set the sales goal at about $2,000 on a weeknight, Lindmark said. By the end of the regular season, they were surpassing forecasts of $3,200 on a weekday.\n\"It's really affected us in a positive way,\" Lindmark said. \"The only negative I can even think of is a rowdy customer or two, but I would never wish it wasn't like it was.\"\nSales have been up at least 30 percent at Wrigleyville Dogs on Clark Street, said Tom Sdralis, who runs the business with his brother, Bob. Since the Cubs have been winning, he said, more corporate types are coming out to the games — and they're spending dough.\n\"The last couple years have been so stressful,\" Sdralis said. \"You're working harder to make less. And this year, you don't have to do anything and you're making money. … Everybody's happy.\"\nMia Francesca, one of the few non-sports bars on Clark Street near Wrigley, was only about half full before last week's playoff game. The Italian restaurant's ambience offers white tablecloths and candlelight; there are no TVs.\nBut when the Cubs are actually in town, Mia Francesca fills up quickly, particularly before night games, said general manager Dave Tobey. That's particularly true when the Cardinals are in town.\nGiven how good this team and this season has been, Tobey said, the future looks bright.\n\"Their stars are so young, it's going to be nice for the entire neighborhood for the next few years,\" Tobey said. \"Everyone's happy for the Cubs, even the Cardinals fans working here.\"\ngtrotter@tribpub.com\nTwitter @GregTrotterTrib\n Chicago Cubs Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5618314c/turbine/ct-cubs-wrigleyville-restaurants-1012-biz-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:18:47.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
