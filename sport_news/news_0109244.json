Dickey will pitch in the American League Division Series in Texas isn't lost on him.\nDickey 's career began with the Rangers, and now the 40-year-old veteran will make his first postseason appearance against the team that drafted him.\n\"It's special for sure,\" Dickey said. \"That seems like such a cliche word, but it's funny how it's come full circle for me personally, having learned the knuckleball here in 2005, and now potentially with a chance to take the series back to Toronto with a Game 4 start. It's poetic is what it is for me. It's a neat narrative.\"\nDickey, a 13-year major-leaguer, has pitched for some good teams, but this is the first time he is in the playoffs.\nHe is cherishing every moment of it, too, and he also feels good about how he is pitching. Over the past month, he owns a 2.84 ERA in five starts.\n\"My body's held up very well,\" he said Sunday before the Blue Jays stayed alive with a 5-1 win over the Rangers in Game 3. \"We're at Game 165 now. A lot of bodies in there are saying, 'Wait a second. We're not used to playing right now.' But I feel really good, which is good because (Monday), you know, I'm going to need to lean on everything I've got.\"\n  American League Game Summary - Toronto at Boston Toronto Blue Jays place Dickey on bereavement list Blue Jays-Nationals postponed due to rain MLB Game Summary - Toronto at Washington", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:12:41.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
