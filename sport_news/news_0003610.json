The 37-year-old Younis clobbered Moeen Ali for six over mid-wicket early in the evening session to surpass the 8,832-run marker set by Javed Miandad, the man considered Pakistan's greatest ever batsman. The few Pakistan fans in a sparse crowd in the United Arab Emirates broke the subdued atmosphere to cheer their man, while the Pakistan dressing room gave him a standing ovation for the feat achieved in his 102nd match — 22 fewer than Miandad, who played the last of his 124 Test matches in December 1993. Younis was eventually out for 38, caught by England skipper Alastair Cook off the bowling of Stuart Broad, with Asad Shafiq (11 not out) and Malik (124 not out) unbeaten at the close. If it was not for Younis, it would have been Malik's day. Returning to the side after a five-year absence, Malik hit his third Test century overall and his first since 2009. It was a steady knock but one which contained one large moment of fortune: Broad overstepping in the first over after lunch rendered the edge to Joe Root in the gully irrelevant. It was one of three gifts afforded to Pakistan during a day when England threatened to shoot themselves in the foot after being asked to bowl in hot conditions and on a track which offered little assistance to bowlers. In the penultimate over of the day, Shafiq edged James Anderson to Ian Bell at second slip. It was the simplest of chances but Bell dropped it. It wasn't his only offence of the day. Mohammad Hafeez breezed to 98 with some smart stroke-play, particularly against England's debutant spinner Adil Rashid, before succumbing leg before to Ben Stokes' last ball before tea. However, the Pakistani opener should have been out for seven when Bell dropped him off the bowling of Anderson — who had already bizarrely dismissed Shan Masood for two with a bouncer which hit his helmet and deflected onto the stumps. Brief scores: Pakistan: 286 for 4 (Shoaib 124*, Hafeez 98) vs England. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:10:40.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
