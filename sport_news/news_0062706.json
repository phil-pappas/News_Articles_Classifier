Aguayo, a first-team All-America honoree in 2014, had knocked in a pair of 60-yard boots during pregame warmups Saturday.\nIf he nailed this final kick, he’d keep Florida State unbeaten. If he missed, the Seminoles would head to overtime.\nBut Aguayo didn’t plan for Option No. 3: the intersection of his kick with the giant hand of Georgia Tech defensive lineman Patrick Gamble . The 6'5\" junior leaped in the air and swatted Aguayo’s potential game-winner, allowing Yellow Jackets defensive back Lance Austin to scoop it up and streak 78 yards for the game-winning score. “It all happened so fast,” Aguayo said. The play sealed Georgia Tech’s epic 22–16 upset of No. 9 Florida State, the second absurdly wonderful, last-minute finish in college football in as many weeks.\nCollege Football Video Watch: Georgia Tech upsets Florida State on blocked field goal return by SI Wire", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ZacEllis"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:14:47.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
