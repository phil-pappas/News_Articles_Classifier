Boxing fans love punchers and these two hit very hard. \n“We knew this could happen, but they are the best of friends and I’m confident they will be again after the fight. \n“They are both of the opinion that, if they are going to lose, they would rather it would be to someone from the club. In my opinion, the winner could go on to be the national champion. \n“They’ve not even been kept away from each other, they were in the ring shadow boxing together the other night. Some people don’t understand - it’s just a sport.” Double delight - Anthony Woolery's two victories saw him crowned West Midlands heavyweight champion. \nHeavyweights Antony Woolery, Solomon Dacres and Louis Brown complete the Black Country contingent still involved, as area titlists waiting for the first national round. \nWoolery, from Richie Carter’s Golden Gloves in Wolverhampton, won twice in three days to take the 91kg Class A West Midlands crown. \nFirst he defeated big Russian Aleksandr Kravcuk, from Wellington Boxing Academy in Shropshire, unanimously on points in a box-off to make the area decider. \nThat put him up against Wolverhampton’s Michael Fietko, who beat him on his own club show earlier this year. \nA determined Woolery dropped him with a right uppercut in the first round, with an under-fire Fietko lucky to see the end of the session. \nThat gave the Black Country-based Pole time to regroup and take the fight back to Woolery, as the two went into the trenches toe-to-toe. \nThe knockdown made the difference as Woolery’s hand was raised unanimously at the final bell, with the judges favouring his aggression over Fietko’s spirited fightback. \nSuper heavyweight Dacres, from Warley, scored unanimous victories two weekends in succession to land 91kg plus honours. \nFirst he downed Walsall Wood’s Daniel Pullinger, before working well again off the jab to send Tamworth’s Rafal Zmarzly the same way. \nMerridale’s Brown didn’t come across an opponent at 91kg in Class B (11 to 20 contests) and progresses without boxing through a bye. \nThe opening bout in Bedworth on Sunday, at 56kg in Class A, saw Brooklands’ Jason Hodgkiss unanimously eliminated by Said Saidi, from D & A in Birmingham. \nHodgkiss, coach and fighter for former pro Darren McDermott’s home gym in Dudley, lost the first round but looked to have won the third, after a close second. \nWaqar Hussain, from Lions in Dudley, went out on a split decision at 60kg to Tyrrell Cummings, from Bell Green in Coventry. \nWolverhampton's Clayton Bricknell didn't make the weight for his 64kg area final, coming down from 69kg. The title instead went to Romain Ncube, from Second City. \nMerridale’s Jugraj Bahia and Rugeley Police’s Alex Makin were two of six entered at 69kg. Bahia lost on a split to Hall Green’s Connor Fanning, Makin unanimously to Aston’s Carl Waldron. \nMerridale’s Jonty Carnegie got to within a fight of the 81kg area final, before bowing out to Orme’s James Cunningham unanimously. \nBeaten finalist Cunningham had conquered Warley’s David Pettifer unanimously in his first fight, with Carnegie recording the same result over Droitwich’s Jonathan Childs. \nIn Class B, Great Wyrley’s Mitchell Roberts was stopped in the second round by Worcester City’s Ameen Khan at 60kg. \nWyrley’s Jamie-Lee Mansell was also knocked out at 69kg by Kaisee Benjamin, from Eastside in Birmingham, who faced Lions’ Gary Tomlinson in the final.
