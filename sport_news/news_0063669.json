The gaffer loves him. He wants to give him that time to build the team around him. \n\"Jack is a good lad and now he is getting into that stage where he has gone beyond potential and is an important cog in the wheel at Villa. That is a different stage of his career now - it becomes expectancy and is a different way of dealing with it. \n\"When you step into that world of Premier League football the expectancy levels are massive and someone with the ability levels of Jack, the expectancy levels go up so you need to have the mentality to cope. \n\"He is going to be a massive player for Villa over the future. It is important that the club build the team around him. I think they have the perfect gaffer for him.\" \nVilla are without a league win since the opening day and have picked up just one point from their last 24 ahead of Saturday's visit of Swansea. \nThey lost 2-0 at Chelsea on Saturday but Cole backed Sherwood to keep them in the top flight. \nHe said: \"The manager has a lot of qualities he brings to the table and he is also getting better everyday. He is learning the trade himself. But he is definitely good enough to keep Villa up and I can see the players getting better and the manager getting better.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:14:20.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
