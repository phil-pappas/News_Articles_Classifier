He said a male suspect is in custody, but didn't say whether the person has been charged.\nArmstrong said the investigation is ongoing and that \"details are sketchy.\"\nIn August, Memphis police officer Sean Bolton was fatally shot in the line of duty.\nPolice have charged 29-year-old Tremaine Wilbourn, who was on probation for an armed bank robbery, with first-degree murder in Bolton's death.\nBolton was white, and Wilbourn is black.\nIn past shootings, Armstrong has addressed the media outside the Regional Medical Center.\n\"I didn't think that we'd be here again so soon,\" Armstrong told reporters on Sunday.", "external_links": ["http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2015/08/memphis_officer_killed_ex-con.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:32:58.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
