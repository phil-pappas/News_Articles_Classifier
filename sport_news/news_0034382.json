State and school officials decided the flooding and the ongoing recovery effort in South Carolina made moving the game the best option. SEC officials, along with both schools and television networks, are still deciding on a kickoff time. \n“In the spirit of supporting our South Carolina community that is so supportive of Gamecock Nation, we have decided to move the game to Baton Rouge,” said USC President Harris Pastides in a press release. “The stress on law enforcement and first responders is too great.
