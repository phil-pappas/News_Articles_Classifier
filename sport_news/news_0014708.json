Getty \nAndy Murray has sealed a place in the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters after an impressive victory over Tomas Berdych. The world number two was made to come from behind in his third-round victory over John Isner on Wednesday (14 October), but made quick work of 2010 Wimbledon finalist Berdych, who took only four games off the Scot in a 6-1 6-3 defeat. \nMurray set up a semi-final clash with Novak Djokovic, whom he beat for the ninth time in his career at the Montreal Masters in August. The Briton sealed the first set in just 38 minutes after breaking Berdych in the third game, going on to win the next nine in a row and race into a 3-0 lead in the second, seeing out the remainder of the contest in comfortable fashion. \nDjokovic meanwhile sealed his place in the final four with a hard-fought victory over Australian Bernard Tomic. The world number one clinched a thrilling tie-breaker to win the first set before comfortably taking the second for a 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 win. \nRafael Nadal meanwhile thrashed Stanislas Wawrinka to set up a showdown with Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the other semi-final.
