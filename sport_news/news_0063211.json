He’s now become a major underdog.\nIt won’t be easy, but the Red Sox would like to trade Craig to a team that might be able to give him a chance at a 25-man roster spot next season. For the second straight year, the Sox have no clear role for the former MVP candidate who mysteriously lost his swing between the 2013 and 2014 seasons.\nBecause he’s owed $9 million in 2016 and $11 million in 2017, the Sox would probably have to swallow most of the contract to find another team willing to give Craig a try.\nTrading Craig would be the “ideal scenario,” president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said on Tuesday. “But I also think it's a situation where, for example, last year the club asked waivers on him to take him off the roster and he cleared. So it's difficult to be in a position, when a guy clears, you can see it's not an easy situation to make happen. But if he's not playing with the big league club, I hope something opens up for him.”\nCraig hasn’t played regularly in the big leagues in more than a year.\nThe 31-year-old is now coming off back-to-back invisible seasons in which he’s barely seen a major league field. Since being traded with Joe Kelly from the St. Louis Cardinals to the Red Sox for John Lackey last July 31, Craig has appeared in just 55 big league games.\nThe Sox tried him in a part-time role earlier this year, but that didn’t work. He was hitting .135 in early May when they had to pass him through waivers to send him to Triple-A Pawtucket. But Craig couldn't catch fire in the minors, either. He hit .274 with four home runs in almost 400 plate appearances.\nThe mystery of Craig’s sudden demise might be enough to lure another team into giving him a chance. Just two years ago he was one of the best run producers in the game, hitting .315 with an .830 OPS with the Cardinals.\nHe might not be agile, but he can play first base and the corner outfield spots adequately enough.\nMaybe he needs a change of scenery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:07:08.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
