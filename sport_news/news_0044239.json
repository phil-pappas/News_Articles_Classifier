Even when I made eight world records, there was the assumption that it’s not due to my ability,” Coe added.\n sports International Association of Athletics Federations Sebastian Coe Also Read SAI athlete's suicide: Parents demand CBI probe FIFA World Cup 2014: Brazil president defends World Cup preparations Abhinav Bindra to coach young shooters My records not meant to be broken, declares Usain Bolt", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/06COE_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/06COE_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151006/sports-other-sports/article/faster-drug-test-soon-says-sebastian-coe", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T14:47:30.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
