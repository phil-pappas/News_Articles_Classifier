Here a four others who changed codes with spectacular results.\nPT1M27S 620 349 As soon as dual-sport athletes are discussed, you know Anthony Mundine will soon be popping his head up to stake his claim.\nAnd with the success and overwhelming popularity of Jarryd Hayne, 'Choc' finally stepped up to answer a question that, in fairness, not many people were asking.\n\"No one's achieved or done half of the stuff I've done,\" Mundine said on in interview with The Locker Room, posted to Facebook. \"If you do your research, you'll see that. I will never get the credit. I'm the best athlete ever produced to come out of this country, ever.\"\nI've done more than Hayne: Anthony Mundine had plenty to say about the 49ers recruit. Photo: Getty Images\nAdvertisement \"What Jarryd Hayne has done is magnificent, but I've done so much more in so much of a harder sport\" Anthony Mundine puts forward a convincing argument as to why he is Australia's greatest ever athlete.\nPosted by The Locker Room on Monday, September 28, 2015\nMundine, the former St George Illawarra rugby league player turned professional boxer, has often claimed he is the best code-swticher in Australian history. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph in April, before the 'Hayne Plane' took off, he said that no other dual-sportsmen could rival his success.\n\"There's no man that has done what I've done and crossed over sports like I have,\" he said. \"I was one of finest players in rugby league. I left in my prime at 24 and switched to boxing. We're talking about the hardest gladiatorial sport on the planet. There's the science and artistry. It's not easy man.\"\nBut with the rise of Hayne, Mundine's place atop his self-anointed throne is now in serious jeopardy.\nBut don't expect him to agree with that summation.\n\"All the hype that Jarryd - I'm not a hater - I'm a positive dude and send positive vibes and Jarryd Hayne, what he's doing is magnificent. But I've done so much more in so much of a harder sport. To switch from a team to an individual sport as boxing. And he's going from a team to team. He's doing well, but it's gonna be hard.\"\n.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Thelockerroomnetwork/videos/620404251432771/", "https://www.facebook.com/Thelockerroomnetwork"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:06:32.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
