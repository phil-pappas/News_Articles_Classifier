No batting practice is allowed within two hours of an NCS playoff game. Soft toss and the use of whiffle balls is allowed. \nJerome Wiggins, representing the Alameda County Board of Education, voted for the motion at the meeting at Mira Vista Golf & Country Club in El Cerrito. \n\"I just think we should eliminate the batting thing completely,\" Wiggins said. \"It puts the schools that have to travel at a disadvantage.\" \nBut Tri-County Athletic League co-comissioner Bill Jones voted against the motion. \n\"Our AD's basically felt there were ways to get around the rule and it was unenforceable. They were happy with the way the rule stands now,\" he said. \nIn another proposal, Fort Bragg High Assistant Principal Bruce Triplett brought up a proposal of increasing the enrollment number for NCS Division 4 football schools so that two teams could be dropped down to Division 5 and balance the divisions. The motion was not approved. \nApostles Lutheran of San Jose was also denied membership in the NCS by a 29-22 vote after discussion about its proximity to similar-sized NCS schools. Advertisement JAYHAWKS are ROCKIN': Not only is Head-Royce girls volleyball undefeated through 19 matches, it has only dropped two sets all season. Both of those came at the Albany Cougar Classic against defending North Coast Section champions, Monte Vista of Division 1 and Marin Academy of Division 4. Both were in the first set before the Jayhawks took two straight to win. Downing such difficult opponents is reflective of Head-Royce's plan this season in upping its number of quality opponents. \n\"We definitely tried to ramp it up,\" Head-Royce athletic director Brendan Blakeley said of the Jayhawks' schedule. \"We're looking at trying to face better competition to prepare for the playoffs.\" \nIn last year's NCS Division 5 postseason, Head-Royce suffered a five-game loss to University -- which it hosts Thursday. But the rematch might not be as competitive, Jayhawks coach Tate Whithall said, because Head-Royce lost only one player to graduation while University lost four. A tougher opponent, he said, may be St. Joseph Notre Dame on Oct. 28. \nLeading the charge for the Jayhawks is senior Natasha Skov, whom Whithall called \"by far and away our best offensive player.\" Skov recently committed to play at Princeton and senior Emma Scanlon is set to play at Portland University. Also integral are twins Alison and Jessica Almgren-Bell. New CIF sport: Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill Wednesday to make competitive cheer a California Interscholastic Federation sport beginning in the 2017-18 school year.
