They also kept the Devils winless at 0-3-1 under new coach John Hynes. \nDeBoer, who was fired by the Devils last season, is now 4-0 with San Jose. \nPatrick Marleau scored for the Sharks in the opening minute and the goal stood until Adam Henrique tied the game on a power play with 3:38 to play in regulation. \nHenrique scored for New Jersey on its first shootout attempt but Jacob Josefson was stopped on the second and Mike Cammalleri missed the net on the third. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:10:40.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
