By Joseph Myers   \nWhen Joe Papp gained exposure to soccer as a 5-year-old Bucks County-based youth, he found every aspect of the beautiful game a struggle and deemed his play “terrible.” Persisting in his passion to be a productive participant, the resident of the 300 block of Jackson Street also realized how overcoming the sport’s inherent difficulties could serve as a metaphor for combatting far more agonizing ills and encourages others to boot their burdens through the Philadelphia Sports Network and its relationship with Street Soccer Philadelphia. \n“As we mature, one hope is that people will grow more self-sufficient,” the 29-year-old opined. “However, that can be very difficult if you’ve had a hard hand dealt to you, so pushes in the right direction can be that motivator that changes your life.” \nThrough Street Soccer Philadelphia, the Whitman inhabitant unites with peers to grace homeless men and women with compassion and appreciation for their beloved pastime. They base their principal teachings on components of the game, with Papp noting that the individuals’ involvement completes a treasured triumvirate of moving from despondency to resiliency. \n“If you need help, it’s one thing to realize that, and it’s another to make a request for assistance,” Papp said. “However, you have to use the resources, and following through with them then becomes your objective.” \nHe and the other do-gooders assist a predominantly male population, with the charges looking to gain enhanced self-esteem and employment. The former falls to Papp to inspire, and he uses the notion that an individual’s growth nourishes a team’s evolution as his chief stance. He likens their realizations to that of students who make breakthroughs to their teachers’ delight, an apt comparison considering that Saturday marked his one-year wedding anniversary to Dana Rose Smith-Papp, an English and language arts instructor at St. Anthony of Padua Regional Catholic School, 913 Pierce St., and the 2014 South Philly Review Readers’ Choice selection as top elementary school teacher. \n“There are so many life lessons and life skills that people can pick up from playing a sport,” Papp said. “I think someone might even be more willing to make those links if he or she has had some trying experiences. I know that when I work with the men and women, I see possibility at every turn. In the grand scheme, it’s easy to act for your own benefit, but when you give, you get, and I’m going to spread that message for as long as I’m on this earth.” \n\nBorn in Langhorne, Papp had opportunities to explore baseball and football, but soccer resonated the most, despite what he considered an initially lackluster attempt to grasp its grace. \n“I just didn’t really take to what else was out there,” he said of gravitating toward the endurance-testing endeavor. “I’m not saying that I was even a good player, far from it, but it’s something that I wanted to stick with because it was fun no matter what level of success I achieved.” \nAs he matured, Papp, who majored in marketing at Temple University, became more of a polished athlete and grew in his knowledge of the game, eventually finding himself best suited to serve as a defender. Interactions with accomplished figures inspires even more curiosity and bred his affiliation with the Philadelphia Sports Network. \n“You go to so many clubs and organizations and find so many people who are obsessed with how they perform,” Papp said of the competitive yet confounding culture advanced by many registrants. “With the Philadelphia Sports Network, you could become involved in so many sports, meet people and feel absolutely no pressure to be good.” \nHe commenced his connection in 2008 and has held the title of soccer commissioner for three years. The network uses numerous South Philly locations for its leagues, including the Marian Anderson Recreation Center, 740 S. 17th St., the lone local spot where one can catch Papp in action. \n“We’re usually quite active because soccer can be so exhilarating if you’re curious about the workings of the action and having a good time with great people,” the gregarious gentleman said of a lesson obtained from his labors, which include overseeing five seasons with seven-week leagues. “I’m still learning, too, so that makes me happy. I find it great to encourage and be encouraged, and soccer is a great outlet for fulfilling both of those.” \nThank to his engrossed approach toward the sport, employment as a service delivery manager for the East Norriton-headquartered HighPoint Solutions and domestic bliss with his bride, Papp counts himself as a fortunate fellow and acknowledges that many of his most prized realizations have come through belief in his abilities and receptivity to the generosity of others, the exact boons that he wishes to offer his Street Soccer Philadelphia roster members in earnest. \n“I love playing this game,” he said of his thrice-a-week obsession. “I’ve always loved this city, too, so with all that’s going on in my life right now, I never lose sight of how blessed I am. I’ll be the first one to tell you to be persistent. You’ll see results.” SPR", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:29:17.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
