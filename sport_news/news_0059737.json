According to Jason La Canfora of CBS , Taylor has an MCL sprain and could miss \"multiple weeks.\"\nThe Bills are now preparing EJ Manuel to start in Taylor's place when the Cincinnati Bengals visit Ralph Wilson Stadium in Week 6. They also signed Josh Johnson to provide the team with a veteran backup to Manuel rather than call up practice squad quarterback Dustin Vaughan.\nTaylor's injury came when Titans linebacker Zach Brown horse-collar tackled him at the end of a third-and-23 run . Taylor managed to finish the game, but he was in obvious pain.\n\"He came in the huddle and told us, 'Now, I need great protection, I can't move that much,'\" Bills running back Boobie Dixon said after the game. \"Just that from your quarterback, that makes you go through the roof. Big shout out to 5.\"\nAsked Monday about Taylor's physical condition, Bills coach Rex Ryan said his quarterback was banged up during the game.\n\"It's always a concern, there's no question,\" Ryan said. \"I can tell you this: He is beat up right now. He's sore. You ought to see him. He is sore. We knew he would be. Guys, he hasn't been 100 percent all season. He's had an ankle even through training camp. We really haven't seen the 100 percent Tyrod Taylor. Of course, you're always concerned when your quarterback takes off with it.\"\nThe Bills will now turn to Manuel after trading primary backup Matt Cassel after the second week of the season. Manuel may have to hold down the fort for more than one week, too.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JasonLaCanfora/status/653997536882073600"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:30:55.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
