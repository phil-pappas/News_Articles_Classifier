Marie Evening News - Sault Ste. Marie, MI By ROBROOS Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 12:31 PM By ROBROOS Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 12:31 PM SAULTSTE. MARIE— A close race for the Cappo Cup is underway. Lake Superior State erupted with a four-goal flurry in the second period and went on to blank Northern Michigan 4-0 at Taffy Abel Arena Saturday night. The teams split a home-and-home weekend series which was designated as non-conference. NMU beat the Lakers 6-3 Friday night in Marquette. Laker freshman goaltender Nick Kossoff made 19 saves for the shutout in his collegiate debut. Kossoff got to lead the Laker post-game celebration of ringing the Hoholik-Husband Victory Bell. “They gave me the hard hat and cape and I got to lead the boys out there and give it the first ring,”Kossoff said. “It was nice to get that first win. “Everybody was ready to go tonight, and we played our game and didn’t let the foot off the gas,” Kossoff said. CJHayes, Kyle Chatham, Owen Headrick and Josh Nenadal scored goals for the Lakers, who improved to 1-3. Gage Torrel dished out three assists. After a scoreless first period. the Lakers struck in the second period. Hayes cashed in on an odd man rush at 8:30 of the period. The Lakers took control and scored three more times in a six-minute window to open up a 4-0 lead. “The script was well written for us tonight, to come out and play with energy and have success in front of our home crowd,” Laker coach Damon Whitten said. “We appreciate the fan support and were happy we could get a win.” It was the first career goals for freshmen Hayes and Headrick, while freshman Nenadal scored goals in both Friday and Saturday’s game. “In some ways, the game was not a ton different than Friday night,”Whitten said. “Friday, all their shots seemed to go in. Tonight, pucks went in for us. “On the scoresheet, our young guys really showed up and did a good job,” Whitten said. “But we also had good contributions from the seniors. The seniors have done a good job of keeping things together through a difficult start.” Atte Tolvanen made 23 saves for the Wildcats (1-1-2), who suffered their first loss. Sault native Denver Pierce made his collegiate debut for NMU. Lake Superior State visits Michigan State this upcoming Thursday and Friday. The Lakers will be back at home for the annual Pink in the Rink weekend on Oct. 30-31 as they face Alabama Huntsville in their first WCHA weekend series of the season. By ROBROOS Sault Ste.
