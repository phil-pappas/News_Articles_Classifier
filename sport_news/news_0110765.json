Three Lenawee County high school football teams learned their playoff opponents Sunday night during the MHSAA Selection Show on Fox Sports Detroit. Clinton, Morenci and Lenawee Christian will compete in their respective state tournaments. Clinton will travel to face Monroe St. Mary Catholic Central in Division 6. Meanwhile, Morenci will host Lenawee Christian in a Division 8 matchup. Here is a look at each local playoff team. CLINTON:The Redskins got a tough draw to say the least. Clinton went 9-0 and figured on having at least one home game in the playoffs, but was placed in a district with defending Division 6 state champion Monroe St. Mary Catholic Central (8-1), Madison Heights Madison (8-1) and Warren Michigan Collegiate (5-4). In its district, the Redskins were only good for a third seed and must play at Monroe’s Navarre Field in the first round. It’s a half-baseball field and half-football field. SMCC eliminated Clinton from the playoffs in 2000, 2007 and in last year’s district final. “We have an outstanding opponent in facing the defending state champion,” Clinton coach Scott McNitt said. “It’s unfortunate that we couldn’t secure a home game after finishing the regular season 9-0. We will prepare like any other week and be ready to go Friday night.” Meanwhile, Manchester, a team the Redskins beat to start the season, was given a No. 1 seed in a separate district. Clinton has been 9-0 in the regular season four straight years. Two years ago, it advanced to the state championship game, losing to Ithaca at Ford Field. Returning All-Stater Mathew Sexton, who played in that game, led the Redskins with 1,561 rushing yards this season. First-year starting quarterback Kaden Kelly has completed only 30 passes, but they’ve gone for more than 500 yards and his completion percentage is 75 percent. MORENCI: It was no surprise that Morenci (7-2) and Lenawee Christian (8-1) would be facing off in the first round. Bulldog coach Mike McDowell and LCS coach Bill Wilharms had already talked Sunday afternoon and exchanged game film, so both teams could get started on the scouting process. “We figured that would be it,” McDowell said. “We’re excited. Our kids are fired up and ready to get after it on Friday.” Morenci enters the playoffs for a third straight year and will host multiple games should it keep winning. They are the No. 1 seed in the district that also includes Tri-County Conference foes Summerfield and Whiteford. Morenci and LCS played a home-and-home series a couple of years ago with the Bulldogs winning both games. “Both were good, close games,” McDowell said. “That was totally different teams and players, but we know they’ve had a good year, and we know they have some good players. The good thing about playing at home is you can maintain your regular routine. That’s what we’ll do.” Page 2 of 2 - LENAWEE CHRISTIAN: For the third time in its brief program history, the Lenawee Christian football team will play in the postseason. The Cougars will face a familiar foe in Morenci on Friday. Morenci defeated LCS in 2012 and 2013. The Cougars had their best regular season in school history, finishing 8-1. Coach Bill Wilharms said his team had a strong desire to get back to the playoffs after falling short last year. “It means a lot to this group of seniors, especially, because it was one of their two big goals,” Wilharms said. “They felt like they had unfinished business to take care of after losing in the first round a couple years ago. This group is looking to have their own legacy, because the team in 2013 was so special. They’ve already accomplished so much, winning eight games.” Wilharms believes it will be a hard-fought battle against the Bulldogs, and he knows them well from his coaching days in the Tri-County Conference. “I have a lot of respect for (Morenci coach Mike) McDowell and the whole Morenci program,” Wilharms said. “Their coaching staff does a great job at getting them ready. The kids know each other, and we know (Morenci) will come ready to hit. We are looking forward to the challenge.” By Daily Telegram staff The Daily Telegram - Adrian, MI By Daily Telegram staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:31:28.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
