Myles Willis came into the game with 18 carries for 122 yards, but amassed 88 yards on 15 carries. \nTHE UGLY: The Clemson offense has shown flashes of being great, but the turnovers will be a problem in a close game. Deshaun Watson threw two interceptions and could have been picked off a couple of more times, as the Tigers lost the turnover battle 2-0. This is the second straight week Clemson has been on the losing end of the turnover margin – minus-four in against Georgia Tech and Boston College. The turnovers led to 10 Boston College points. \nSOUND SMART WITH YOUR FRIENDS: Jordan Leggett Jordan Leggett #16 6-5, 252Navarre, FL View Full Profile has caught a touchdown pass in each of Clemson’s last four games. The only other such streak was in 1983 by K.D. Dunn. \nWHAT’S NEXT: Clemson travels to Miami for what we think will be a primetime matchup with the Hurricanes at Sun Life Stadium. \nBoston College travels to Louisville, as the Eagles are looking for their first ACC win.
