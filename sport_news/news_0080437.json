Peterson was questionable entering the game after reportedly swallowing chewing tobacco juice during a bumpy flight to Detroit. \nMinnesota rookie wide receiver Stefon Diggs caught six passes for 108 yards and a touchdown. The Vikings defense clamped down after allowing two first-quarter touchdowns and sacked Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford seven times. \nStafford finished with 256 passing yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Calvin Johnson caught five passes for 86 yards and a touchdown. The Lions (1-6), who entered the game with the league's worst rushing attack, gained just 77 yards on 17 carries. Rookie Ameer Abdullah led the Lions with 43 yards on eight carries. \nDiggs' diving 36-yard catch early in the third quarter put Minnesota on top, 22-17. Diggs beat the coverage of cornerback Rashean Mathis with a double move. That drive was extended by a defensive holding call against the Lions. \nWalsh's 35-yard field goal midway through the quarter and his 22-yarder during the opening minute of the fourth made it 28-17. \nDetroit (1-6) reached the Minnesota 1-yard line in the late going but wound up turning the ball over on downs. The Vikings took a safety with 59 seconds remaining during a punt formation after failing to pick up a first down. \nThe Lions scored on their first two possessions and led 17-15 at halftime. \nJohnson scored on a 1-yard pass to complete Detroit's first possession, which included a 36-yard Johnson reception. Tight end Eric Ebron's 7-yard reception later in the quarter made it 14-3. Ebron caught five passes for a team-high 89 yards. \nTight end Kyle Rudolph scored on a 1-yard pass from Bridgewater for Minnesota's only touchdown in the half. Walsh made three field goals, including two from more than 50 yards, but also missed an extra-point attempt. \nNOTES: TE Brandon Pettigrew (knee), CB Josh Wilson (concussion) and LB DeAndre Levy (hip) were among the inactives for Detroit. DT Sharrif Floyd (knee) and DE Justin Trattou (foot) missed the game for Minnesota. ... Minnesota's defense hadn't allowed a first-quarter touchdown prior to Detroit's opening drive. ... The Vikings now leads the all-time series, 71-36-2. ... The Vikings play another division rival, the Bears, in Chicago on Sunday while the Lions head to London to face the Kansas City Chiefs. ... Vikings RB Adrian Peterson's 75-yard run in the third quarter was the fifth time he's had a rush for that many yards. Three of those runs have come against the Lions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:56:47.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
