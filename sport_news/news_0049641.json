NHHS VB outlasts Lyndon on senior night By Stephen Coleman stephen@emporia.com   \nTuesday didn’t present the start the Northern Heights volleyball team sought to its senior night, but things still ended appropriately as NHHS claimed a 2-1 victory over Lyndon to cap a two-match sweep. \n“It’s awesome that we can come out and get a win on our senior night,” said Natalie Leffler, one of six Wildcats playing their final home match. \nIt was Leffler who answered the call late, as head coach Stephanie Dall was looking for someone to emerge and help take charge. \n“(Leffler) has a knack for finding the lines,” Dall said. “Most of the time she does a pretty good job of finding holes in general. \n“I’m proud of all those girls. They pulled it out.” \nIt was the Wildcats’ second match with Lyndon that brought some drama, as the Tigers watched Northern Heights win their first battle 25-19, 25-20. \nIn the second match of the dual, it started in a very different direction. \nLyndon started off with an 8-2 lead, but wasn’t able to keep its advantage intact. A late Wildcats run brought the game into a tie before the Tigers scored the final two in a 27-25 Lyndon victory. \n“We had to get more energy and momentum in that second match,” Leffler said. “Whenever we got a good pass or a solid block or a great hit we got more energy, we kept feeding off of that.” \nNorthern Heights built off a pair of strong runs to run away with a 25-15 victory in the second set, forcing a third set that again would hold plenty of drama. \nAfter Lyndon surged ahead to a 10-4 lead, the Wildcats began to slowly chip away at their deficit, but not before Dall used a timeout to gather her team’s attention. \n“I told them they needed to play volleyball,” she said. “Those first eight points didn’t look like volleyball to me. We were all over the place. I watched all of them look up at that scoreboard... I don’t care what the score says, you’ve got to fight for the ball at hand. That’s the only one that matters.” \nNHHS rallied to knot the game up at 12 before a 6-0 run put them in the driver’s seat. Lyndon battled back to within two at 20-18, but Heights finished on a 5-0 run to close up the set and the match. \nLeffler had several kills down the stretch, including two of the final points. \nFor Dall, the comeback gave more than a glimpse of what she hopes could turn into a good postseason run. \n“It’s reinforcing to my hopes of getting to state this year,” she said. “Last year we had a really good chance at going to state and we just fell shy playing against Olpe. This year again we’ve got a pretty good chance of doing something at that sub-state, I’m just hoping they can pull it through like they did tonight.” \nThe Wildcats are now 10-10 on the year and will play at Council Grove on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:30:08.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
