(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) \nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Jason Spezza is on an offensive roll. \nSpezza scored a momentum-shifting goal in the third period and had an assist as the Dallas Stars beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 5-3 on Thursday night. \n“Jason is pretty hot right now,” said Dallas goalie Kari Lehtonen, who made 30 saves. \nDallas also got goals from Tyler Seguin, Jamie Benn, Cody Eakin and Jason Demers. \nSteven Stamkos had two goals and an assist for the Lightning. \nVladislav Namestnikov (7:06) and Stamkos (8:44) scored 1:38 apart in the third to get the Lightning within 4-3. \nSpezza, coming off a three-goal game in Tuesday’s 4-2 win over Edmonton, responded and gave Dallas a 5-3 lead at 10:29. \n“It’s been a good week for me,” Spezza said. “I’m just trying to keep it going.” \nDallas coach Lindy Ruff expected the defending Eastern Conference champion Lightning to make a third-period push. \n“They’re a good team,” Ruff said. “They forced us into a couple turnovers and took advantage. But, we answered right away.” \nSpezza has 21 goals and 52 points in 39 games against Tampa Bay. \nDemers put Dallas up 4-1 with 1:48 to go in the second during a 5-minute power play. \nThe man advantage came about after Tampa Bay’s Nikita Nesterov was given a 5-minute penalty and game misconduct at 15:56 for hitting Curtis McKenzie from behind. \nMcKenzie needed assistance from the ice and appeared to be unable to put weight on his leg as he headed toward the locker room from the bench. The Stars said McKenzie had a game-ending lower body injury and was taken to an area hospital. \nEarlier in the second, Tampa Bay defenseman Victor Hedman was shaken up and went to the locker room after getting checked into the boards by Benn. \nLightning coach Jon Cooper had no update on Hedman’s status, but said the defenseman did go through concussion protocols. \n“We’re concerned for his well-being,” Lightning center Brian Boyle said. “We want him to be OK and be well.” \nEakin made it 3-1 skating alone down the slot and taking a backhand pass from Mattias Janmark at 9:34 of the second. \nJanmark is the first Dallas Stars rookie to have at least one point in each of his first four NHL games. \nBenn was left alone near the post and scored a power-play goal off a nice pass from Spezza to put Dallas ahead 2-1 with 5:46 left in the first. \nTampa Bay has allowed seven power-play goals in five games this season. \nThe Stars tied it at 1 at 8:58 on Seguin’s goal. \nStamkos opened the scoring 2:24 into the game. He has seven goals in eight games against Dallas. \nTampa Bay’s Ben Bishop allowed five goals on 22 shots. \nNOTES: Tampa Bay is 4-12-3 at home against Dallas, their worst home record against any opponent. … Lightning C Alex Killorn was a late scratch due to an upper body injury. … McKenzie was recalled from Dallas of the AHL on Wednesday after RW Patrick Eaves went on injured reserve Wednesday with a lower body injury. … Tampa Bay C Cedric Paquette (foot) played for the first time this season. … Stars RW Valeri Nichushkin was scratched for the second consecutive game.
