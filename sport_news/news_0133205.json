In the Annika event -- named after former Arizona golfer Annika Sorenstam -- Stoll started with a 1-over 73 that included an eagle on the par-5 14th, then shot a second-round 72 that included a 33 on the back nine.\nStoll then moved 13 spots up the leaderboard in the final round with a five-birdie, two-bogey 69, closing the tournament with a birdie on the 18th hole. She was one of six golfers in the 60-player field to break 70 in the final round.\n\"Gigi had an amazing first tournament,\" coach Laura Ianello told Arizona's sports information staff. \"She was very happy with her results. Her putting was spectacular.\"\nStoll and the Wildcats resume their fall schedule at the two-day Windy City Collegiate that starts Tuesday in Evanston, Illinois.\n-- Mike Tokito\nmtokito@oregonian.com\n503-294-7604; @mtokito", "external_links": ["http://rankings.golfweek.com/rankings/default.asp?T=wt", "https://twitter.com/mtokito"], "published": "2015-09-30T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:25:51.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
