Curtis Granderson drove in five runs with two doubles off the wall, Travis d'Arnaud and Yoenis Cespedes homered, and New York's dangerous bats busted loose for a 13-7 victory Monday night that gave the Mets a 2-1 advantage in the best-of-five NL playoff. Before a bloodthirsty crowd of 44,276 in the first postseason game at Citi Field, the Mets broke their postseason scoring record as public enemy No. 1 Chase Utley watched from the Los Angeles' bench. The Mets quickly erased an early three-run deficit and made a winner of a mediocre Matt Harvey in his playoff debut. \"The greatest retaliation is winning,\" Mets outfielder Michael Cuddyer said. Back in the postseason for the first time in nine years, the Mets can reach the NL Championship Series with another win at home Tuesday night behind rookie pitcher Steven Matz. Utley is the subject of scorn in New York after his late takeout slide Saturday night broke the right leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada at Dodger Stadium. Amid much speculation the Mets would seek revenge, manager Terry Collins said before the game Harvey was told not to. \"I think the boos at the introductions were kind of a big statement leading into the game,\" Harvey said. \"For us it was stay focused, go out and let our play do all the talking and, you know, all that stuff will be resolved later.\" Collins said both teams met with commissioner Rob Manfred before the game and he instructed them to play \"correctly.\" Umpires did not issue any warnings prior to the first pitch. \"I thought our guys responded very, very well,\" Collins said. In the end, Utley never got in the game and the Mets saved all their hard hits for when they were at the plate. Harvey labored through five innings in his first outing since missing a mandatory postseason workout and apologizing after he arrived. \"He worked harder tonight to give us five quality innings than I have seen him work at any time,\" Collins said. Los Angeles lefty Brett Anderson, who went back and forth with Mets fans on Twitter over Utley's suspension Sunday night, took the loss. He was tagged for six runs and seven hits in three ineffective innings. Granderson's five RBI matched a Mets' postseason record last accomplished by Carlos Delgado in Game 4 of the 2006 NLCS at St. Louis, when New York established its previous postseason high of 12 runs. Adrian Gonzalez and Howie Kendrick homered late for the Dodgers, who peppered Harvey with four consecutive singles in the second inning to build a 3-0 lead with the aid of Granderson's throwing error from right field. Notes - Matz is a hometown favorite after growing up on Long Island about 50 miles from Citi Field. He went 4-0 with a 2.27 ERA in six major league starts this season but hasn't pitched since Sept. 24 because of a balky back. To sharpen up, he threw approximately 90 pitches during a simulated game Thursday in Florida and worked off the main mound at Citi Field on Sunday. \"Really trying to take the emotions out of it,\" he said Monday. \"I have a job to do.\" By The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:34:30.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
