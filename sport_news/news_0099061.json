I put on a suit, a long mink coat. I put on some bling, too — a Piaget watch, a bold lock chain, a jammin’ set of earrings. All that jewelry, plus my mink coat, I must have been wearing about a quarter-million dollars, but those were heady times, man,” it says in the book, according to Deadspin . “This was how we rolled, me and my boys, and when you come from nothing like I did, step into all this money like I did, you’re bound to strut a little bit. I was over the top, I’ll admit. Way, way over the top. I get that. I’m sorry. Frankly, I’m a little embarrassed about all that now, but this was the mentality, and I only mention it here because it became a part of the story.”\nThis version of events is from Chapter 9, titled “Atlanta,” of the 250-page book, written with co-author/ghostwriter Daniel Paisner. Despite his finery, Lewis — now an analyst for ESPN — claims he was protecting a scantily-clad woman from aggressive advances.\n“Then, just as I was about to set down myself this one dude from the group ran toward me. He was all worked up, agitated. He turned to his friends and said, “Man, f–k Ray Lewis! Kill that n—-r, dawg!”\nIt took me back, hearing this kind of ugly talk — from a black dude, no less. But I could see him and his gangbangers starting to circle, so I said, ‘Hey, look man. Ain’t nobody doing all this right now. Let’s just move on.’ Right then, I took this as my signal to get everybody out of there, and all hell broke loose from that moment.\nLewis sits with his attorney waiting for his arraignment in March 2000 in Atlanta. Photo: AP “Remember, I was dressed out, had my jewelry on, my fine mink coat. I wasn’t about to start mixing it up looking like that. That’s a general rule of thumb when you’re doing the town and looking good. The nicer you’re dressed, the less inclined you are to fight — that is, if you’re even inclined in that way to begin with. Anyway, we’d all been down this way before, knew enough to know it was just a bunch of noise, just a bunch of nonsense, so the thing to do to diffuse all that noise and nonsense was to show each other what you had. It was like a standoff-type situation, and there really wasn’t any more to it than that. Only thing flying around was words, but at the same time there was trouble in the air. You could kind of feel it.”\nThe trouble ended up with shots being fired, a bullet striking the tire of Lewis’ limousine. Still, at that point, Lewis – who went on to become a 13-time Pro Bowler and two-time Super Bowl champion — writes he and his friends were trying to avoid trouble.\n“There I was, all dressed out in my mink coat, my fine suit. Dude dresses like that, he’s not looking for a fight. How I was dressed, it made no sense with what went down, those shots being fired, all of that,” goes another passage, detailed by TMZ . “Forget what kind of statement my clothes might have made. Forget that I might have been a little loud, over the top. Point is, when you’re dressed like that, you’re off to the sidelines, and here were these gangbangers stepping out to us from the shadows, looking to make trouble — but it was trouble we drove right past.”\nLewis’ clothes from that night, in particular the white suit he was wearing, always were central to the murder investigation. A witness for the prosecution testified she saw another passenger in the limo put a hotel laundry bag in a dumpster. The prosecution alleged Lewis’ bloodied white suit was in that bag, but it was never found.\nLewis reportedly insists in the book he had no clue anybody had been stabbed in the fight until he got home, turned on the TV and saw police were searching for his limo. He settled with the victims’ families in civil court, but he’s adamant the settlement isn’t an admission of guilt, just an expression of charity.\n“I gave because I had it to give,” the book says, via TMZ. “I knew that money would never bring back what the families wanted most. But they asked for it, so I gave.”\n  baltimore ravens ,  murders ,  ray lewis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:01:08.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
