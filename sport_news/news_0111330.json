But New York's success on third downs has catapulted it to a 17-16 lead over the Patriots, thanks to a nine-yard swing pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Chris Ivory for the touchdown. The Jets went 3-for-3 on third down on the drive, converting on third-and-seven, third-and-five and another third-and-seven. New York is 8-for-12 on the day on third down, keying its long, time-consuming scoring drives. Patriots settle for another field goal After another Stephen Gostkowski field goal, the Patriots hold a 16-10 lead midway through the third quarter at Gillette Stadium. On the opening drive of the second half, New England drove 65 yards to a first-and-goal at the New York 6-yard-line. But Tom Brady was long on a fade route to Rob Gronkowski on first down, threw it out of the back of the end zone on second down and saw Julian Edelman drop a touchdown on third down. Edelman had beaten Darrelle Revis on the crossing route, only to juggle the ball at the goal line. New England has at least a handful of drops on the day, most of them by Brandon LaFell. Not surprisingly, LaFell hasn't seen action in the second half yet. Gostkowski kicks Patriots to lead The Patriots have a 13-10 lead over the Jets, thanks to Stephen Gostkowski. Tom Brady hit Rob Gronkowski for a 26-yard gain on third down to keep the drive alive. The play put the offense at the Jets' 29-yard line. A holding penalty by Cam Fleming pushed them back and they were never able to recover. They came close after a 19-yard reception from Brandon LaFell, but Brady got sacked by Calvin Pace on third-and-1. Gostkowski hit a 46-yard field goal with two minutes remaining in the first half. Tom Brady and the Patriots even the score at 10-10 Things haven’t been easy for the offense so far, but the Patriots have tied the game up, 10-10, in the second quarter. The Patriots started their fourth offensive possession with solid field position, at the 47-yard line, thanks to a poor punt. Brandon LaFell opened the drive with a drop – although the pass was thrown slightly behind him. The Patriots were able to get it together, picking up two first downs thanks to Danny Amendola. The receiver caught an eight-yard pass on third-and-7, ducking underneath Marcus Gilchrist to pick up the first-down yardage. On the very next play Amendola hauled in a Brady pass for 23 yards, holding on to the ball despite a hard hit from Gilchrist. Brady showed off his legs with an 11-yard run to set up a first-and-goal from the 2. Things didn’t get any easier close to the goal line. The Patriots ended up going for it on fourth-and-goal from the 1. Brady leaped over the pile and past the goal line to tie the game, 10-10, with 6:24 left in the first half. Page 2 of 2 - Jets take 10-3 over Patriots The Patriots defense is going to have to do better than this. The Jets opened up the second quarter with another long drive and this time capped it off with a touchdown to take a 10-3 lead. Missed sacks by the Patriots turned into long gains on this drive. Fitzpatrick ran for 11 yards after evading defenders and two plays later hit Tommy Bohanon for 23 when Akiem Hicks couldn’t wrap him up. The defense also struggled on third down. On the first third-down on this drive, the quarterback hit Eric Decker for a 17-yard gain. On the next third down, Fitzpatrick hit Jeremy Kerley for 12 to set up a first-and-10 from the 11. The next third down came on the 2-yard line for the Jets. Chris Ivory picked up the first to set up a first-and-goal from the 1. A false start knocked them back, but it didn’t matter. On the next play, Kerley beat Justin Coleman for a five-yard touchdown at 12:33. Patriots-Jets tied 3-3 in the first quarter The Jets were expected to test the Patriots secondary Sunday. On the second drive of the game, they did just that and now we’re tied, 3-3. The Jets got two big catches from Eric Decker to keep the drive going. Twice on third-and-10, the wideout caught a pass on Malcolm Butler for a first down. The first play went for 24 yards and put the Jets over midfield at the 40-yard line. Decker then caught an 11 yard pass on third down. Ryan Fitzpatrick also hit Brandon Marshall for a 13-yard gain on Logan Ryan. After a hands-to-the-face penalty against Justin Coleman, the Jets had a first-and-goal from the 4-yard line. The Patriots got two pass deflections in the end zone, one by Coleman and a great one by Patrick Chung, who knocked the ball out of Jeff Cumberland’s hands. The Jets settled for a 20-yard field goal from Nick Folk with 7:32 left in the first quarter. Patriots take early 3-0 lead over Jets Well, that was fast. The Patriots took an early 3-0 lead over the New York Jets, thanks to their defense. The Jets took the field first, but two plays in the defense forced their first turnover. At 14:17, Chandler Jones strip-sacked Ryan Fitzpatrick and Dont’a Hightower recovered the fumble to give the Pats the ball at the 19-yard line. Tom Brady & Co. didn’t do much with the field position. After hitting Rob Gronkowski for a 5-yard gain, Brady got sacked by Muhammed Wilkerson and Stephen Gostkowski ended up hitting a 38-yard field goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:36:47.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
