His white No. 33 jersey was covered in dirt and grass stains. His shoulder pads were splattered with green from the Argonaut jerseys. His young face looked tired as he wiped off 48 minutes worth of dirt and sweat from his forehead. Ulvavedet had been through perhaps the most physically demanding game of the season and every hit he took showed in each step. Yet, for the first time all year, he walked off an opponent's field a winner. “We've told them that we are going to have to do something that has never been done before and it started tonight,” said first-year head coach Sean Leveroos, who captured his first road victory of his Summerville coaching career. “We had to go on the road and get a road victory to get to our ultimate goal of making the playoffs.” It appeared as if the Bears road woes would continue early in the game. Before the Summerville offense could take the field, the scoreboard read 7-0 in favor of Argonaut. To begin the second quarter, Summerville had good field position to begin its second drive of the night. With the ball on the Argonaut 30, Ulvevadet took an inside handoff from his fullback position and ran right up the gut. He broke two tackles and the only thing standing in front of him and the end zone was the Argonaut free safety. Ulvevadet, who is a one trick pony when it comes to open field running, did the thing he does best — run over the defender. He dropped his right shoulder and exploded through the would be tackler on his way to a 30-yard score. Jake Noonan added the extra point and the Bears tied the game at 7 with 9:30 remaining in the first half. “It's a good feeling to run someone over,” Ulvevadet said, who finished the night with a team-high 54 rushing yards. “When you get one-on-one with someone, you have to beat them to get the touchdown and that's what I did. And I owed it to the linemen to get that score.” The Ulvevadet score not only energized the Summerville faithful, who made the 1.5-hour drive from Tuolumne, but it also lit a fire in the Bears defense. The Summerville defense had a bend-but-don't-break mentality. Argonaut runs a spread offense, which typically is used for passing, but attempted only one pass in the first half. Argonaut was able to move the chains, but with 3:08 remaining in the first half, the Bears held Argonaut on fourth down with the ball deep in Summerville territory. Senior quarterback and defensive back Travis Rodgers marched the Bears down the field to the Argonaut 8 with 27 seconds remaining in the half. Rodgers took the snap and dropped back into the pocket. His first read was covered, and he looked toward Eli McLaurin in the back of the end zone. Rodgers threw a rocket that McLaurin and Argonaut cornerback Jared Coppock caught at the same time. The two landed in the end zone and the ball popped out. The Summerville sideline was screaming touchdown. The Argonaut sideline was screaming interception or incomplete pass. The referees were unsure what to call. The zebras huddled in the back of the end zone, and following a lengthy discussion, the head official put both hands in the air and signaled touchdown. At halftime the referees were asked about the play, and the response was when there is a simultaneous reception, it always goes to the offense. Much like tie goes to the runner in baseball. “It looked like we had knocked the ball out before there was total possession, but the ref told me that if they both catch it and the feet are down, anything after that is done,” said Argonaut head coach Gary Landergen. “So, that is what we have to live by. I wanted it to be an incomplete pass, but that is the call and you have to live with that on Friday night's.” McLaurin finished the night with six receptions for 66 yards. The Bears have not had too many lucky bounces the past few weeks, so they were happy this one went in their favor and took the 14-7 lead into halftime. The second half was all about defense and gutsy calls. Twice, the Bears looked at a fourth-and-1 with the ball in their own territory, and they went for it each time. With each first down, the Summerville fans stood up and in unison yelled, “FIRST DOWN BEARS!” Though he was unable to get into the end zone, sophomore call up Luke Fulkerson in his varsity debut rushed for 50 yards and hauled in 32 through the air. “There were a lot of nerves in the beginning of the game, but after a few hits I was into it and felt good out there,” Fulkerson said. And Ulvevadet liked having someone to block for again from his fullback position. “I love being able to make a block and letting other people get the yards,” Ulvevadet said. “People might not know about the lead blocker, but they know about the guy running. That's all I care about. I just care about getting my teammates yards.” The final fourth down came with 1:38 left in the game. Rodgers kept the ball on a quarterback sneak, and iced the game for Summerville. “FIRST DOWN BEARS,” the Summerville fans shouted. With the win, Summerville (4-4, 2-2 MLL) still has its playoff dreams alive. However, they will need to beat Calaveras next week at home. And with their bye week, the Calaveras players and coaches were in attendance Friday night, watching their next opponents first-hand. “I think they saw a team that they are going to hit as hard as they can and try to stop,” Ulvevadet said.
