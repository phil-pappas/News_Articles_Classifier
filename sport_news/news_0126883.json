Former professional wrestling star Jimmy “Superfly” Snuka will be heading to trial in the death of his mistress more than three decades ago.\nDefense attorneys agreed Wednesday to bypass a preliminary hearing in Lehigh County in exchange for grand jury transcripts and other evidence in the 1983 death of 23-year-old Nancy Argentino of New York.\nSeventy-two-year-old Snuka of Waterford Township, New Jersey, is charged with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. He will remain free pending trial in lieu of 10 percent of $100,000 bail .\nArgentino was pronounced dead in May 1983 after authorities were called to a Whitehall Township hotel room she was sharing with Snuka.\nDefense attorney Robert Kirwan II on Wednesday called her death “simply an unfortunate accident … not murder.”\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
