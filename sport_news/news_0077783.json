Notably, TMC tallied an impressive .415 attack percentage. \nOn Friday, TMC bested the Menlo Oaks in three sets (25-19, 25-20, 25-20). \nBritney Jones led TMC by posting eight kills and 12 digs, while Maryah Richberg, Emily Curtin and Koch each tallied six kills. Bekendam had a fantastic showing by chipping in 21 assists. \nFinally on Saturday, TMC improved its 2015 record to 16-8 overall and 7-3 in GSAC play after beating William Jessup in three sets (25-16, 25-19, 25-15). \nAubrey Pybrun had a phenomenal day. The junior outside hitter finished the match with a staggering .611 attack percentage after claiming 11 kills. Jones also performed well in the outing by tallying eight kills and seven digs. Bekendam continued her stellar senior season by posting an evening-high 36 digs. \nNow, the Mustangs are preparing for a pair of home matches against San Diego Christian and Arizona Christian. TMC will take on SDCC on Friday at 7 p.m. and Arizona Christian at 4 p.m. on Saturday. \nWomen’s Soccer \nTwo days after falling to Menlo in a close 1-0 decision, The Master’s College women’s soccer team got back to its winning ways by beating William Jessup 1-0 in overtime. \nAfter eight minutes of overtime, TMC’s Taylor Rowden broke a 0-0 tie by scoring an unassisted goal, lifting the NAIA 21st-ranked Mustangs past the William Jessup Warriors. \nThe win, TMC’s first road victory of the season, improved the Mustangs’ 2015 campaign to 7-7-1 overall and 4-3 in GSAC play. \nRowden finished the match with two shots and one shot on goal, while Kelsey Kukaua and Kinley Kane both posted two shots. Defensively, Mustang goalkeeper Yazmin Osorio earned her third win of the season after putting in 52 minutes of work. \nNow, with only two regular-season home matches left, the Mustangs will prepare for a busy week, taking on San Diego Christian College and Biola University at Reese Field. TMC will face SDCC at 3 p.m. on Wednesday and then play No. 11 Biola on Saturday at 11 a.m. \nMen’s Soccer \nLast Wednesday, The Master’s College men’s soccer team battled to a 1-1 double-overtime tie against the Menlo Oaks in Atherton. \nTwo days later, goals from three different players and another brilliant Casey Phillips’ performance in goal led to a 3-0 blanking of William Jessup. \nAvoiding overtime for the first time in four starts, the 17th-ranked Mustangs improved to 10-3-2 overall and 4-2-1 in the GSAC where they took a firm hold on third place with 13 points, two behind second-place Vanguard and three ahead of Westmont and San Diego Christian. \nThe victory also marked the 18th time in Jim Rickard’s 25 years as head coach that his teams have won at least 10 games. \nTMC’s Ryan Dolan used his head to put the Mustangs out in front to stay. Known more for his defense, the Dolan turned offensive, taking a Zach Klindworth corner kick and scoring his first career goal to give the Mustangs a 1-0 lead. \nIn the waning seconds of the first half, Benjamin Tembo found Austin Rochow in the box and the senior one-timed it between the pipes with 33 seconds left in the half to double the Mustang advantage. It was Rochow’s third goal of the season. \nWith just over five minutes gone in the second stanza, Humphrey Mahowa took a pass in the box from Klindworth and deposited the ball into the left-side netting for a 3-0 lead. \nThat was Mahowa’s GSAC-leading 11th goal of the season and Klindworth’s sixth of the season, which tied him with teammate Christopher Logan for the team lead. \nMustang Goalkeeper Casey Phillips had an impressive outing by notching seven saves. \nNow, the Mustangs will welcome San Diego Christian to Reese Field for another crucial match on Wednesday. Gametime is set for 1 p.m. \nFor more information on The Master’s College Athletic Department, visit www.masters.edu/athletics, or follow the Mustangs on Facebook at facebook.com/TMCAthletics and Twitter and Instagram at @TMCAthletics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:20:21.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
