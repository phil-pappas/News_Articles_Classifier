If you become successful you cannot carry on like this. \n\"I haven't seen (Rafa) Nadal or (Novak) Djokovic or the great golfers like Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan and Arnold Palmer acting like that. \n\"If you want to act that way, fine, but remember you've got respect for your country and your sport that you have to protect. \n\"I'd like to sit down with them, athlete to athlete and talk about the responsibilities they do carry. They have to make some changes and some sacrifices.\" \nLocal pundits have been quick to compare the bad boy duo of Australian tennis with the country's top golfers in Jason Day and Adam Scott. \nBoth Day and Scott have each won major tournaments and claimed the top ranking of their sport without a whiff of controversy. \nTwo-time major champion Norman said Australian golf was in good hands, describing Day and Scott as \"great, elite, iconic players\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:54:46.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
