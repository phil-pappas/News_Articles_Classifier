Barons' head coach Tim Thomas says, \"He's definitely an impact player. He's a guy that you got to get the ball in your hands at all times. It makes sense, why not? He's a playmaker.\" \"Our offense is very balanced,\" says Johnson. \"You get the ball a couple times a game, so you have to make the best our of what you get. I look at it like, 'If this is the only time I might get it, I'm going to do the one thing I want to do, which is score.'\" The scoring isn't limited to offense, as Johnson has also found the endzone on defense and special teams. Johnson says, \"I returned one the first game, and they haven't really been kicking to be since. On defense I try to find ways to make plays, and maybe get in the endzone.\" The senior's ability to keep a play alive puts pressure on the opposition, as well as his teammates. Senior WR/DB Jemeil King says, \"It's a little tiring blocking for him, because you don't know where he's going to go, but it's always fun to see what he's going to do next.\" Malik Johnson has been terrorizing opponents on the gridiron, but football is not his primary athletic focus. Johnson is also the point guard for the Barons' basketball team, and recently gave a verbal commitment to play for Division I Canisius College in Upstate New York. \"If I wanted to play football, I think I could be real good at it, but basketball is my sport,\" says Johnson. The point guard skills translate well to the football field. \"He's a playmaker,\" says King. \"It's hard to catch up with him because of his speed. Once he gets by you, he's pretty much off to the races.\" Johnson adds, \"In basketball, we play at a real, uptempo speed. We do a lot of trapping, and rotating, so when I play linebacker or safety, it's like the same thing as basketball.\" Malik Johnson scored a game-high 19 points in the Barons' victory in the VISAA state championship game last season.
