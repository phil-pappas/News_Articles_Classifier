Proceeds will benefit inner-city kids in his hometown of Oakland. Football star and Oakland, California, native Marshawn \"Beast Mode\" Lynch has lent his name to a new coffee creation at Starbucks. The Seahawks running back sampled several flavor profiles before deciding on his signature offering, a double mocha Frappuccino with mint, cream and protein powder, topped with whipped cream, \"purple berry drizzle\" and matcha green tea powder, according to the coffee chain. Lynch sports a Golden State Warriors cap in the photos accompanying a Starbucks news release announcing the Beast Mode Frappuccino. The Warriors are based in Oakland. Proceeds from the blended coffee drink will benefit Oakland inner-city youth via Lynch's Fam 1st Family Foundation , with a donation of up to $100,000. \"Beast Mode\" hits Starbucks shops in Oakland and Washington state on Oct. 22 and will be available throughout the football season.
