The Hokies fell at home in Cassell Coliseum 1-3 to the Yellow Jackets Sunday evening.   12:15 pm Virginia Tech volleyball sweeps Clemson, but loses to Georgia Tech Josh Wilets, volleyball beat reporter   1 comment \nFriday night, Oct. 16, the Hokies defeated the Clemson Tigers 3-0 (25-19, 25-19, 25-17). This sweep was the sixth sweep of the season for Virginia Tech. \nWins of this caliber have been important for the Hokies, who use them to gain momentum going forward. \n“It’s important for us to gain confidence and work on things,” junior outside hitter Lindsey Owens said. \nEarly on in the first set, the Hokies were playing sloppy volleyball, going down 5-9 early. After a timeout, Tech refocused and bounced back with a 5-0 scoring run, giving them a 10-9 lead. \n“We need to come out with a sense of urgency from the first point, that we have something to prove,” Virginia Tech head volleyball coach Chris Riley said. \nLate in the set with the Hokies leading 19-17, a kill by Owens hit Clemson middle-blocker Sofia Hruby in the head. Hruby exited the set and did not return for the rest of the match. \nThe injury proved to be a big blow for the Tigers, who gave up a 10-2 run near the end of the set. Despite a slow start and owning just a 0.115 attack percentage, the Hokies took the first set by a score of 25-19. \nClemson made seven attack errors and recorded only seven kills in the set. The seven attack errors, however, were fewer than those committed by Virginia Tech, which had nine. The difference was that Clemson only tallied seven kills, compared to the 15 kills that Tech recorded. \nKeelie Arneson recorded 12 digs in the set for the Tigers. For the Hokies, Owens tallied six kills, and Rhegan Mitchell recorded nine assists and eight digs. \nThe second set started out much like the first with Tech trailing 6-2 and calling a timeout to regroup. \nA 4-0 Tech run knotted the set at 9-9. Later in the set, Tech went on a 6-0 run to take an 18-15 lead. The Hokies won the second set 25-19, just like the first, and took a 2-0 lead in the match. \nClemson committed 10 errors and recorded only eight kills in the second set, leading to a -0.054 attack percentage. Mitchell added nine more assists and two more digs for Virginia Tech. \nThe third set featured a downright beat-down by Virginia Tech. Fueled by a 7-2 run in the middle of the set, the Hokies were able to finish off the Tigers 25-17, winning the match 3-0. \nMitchell added 14 more assists and five more digs, finishing with 32 assists and 15 digs and recording a double-double. \n“I think she’s doing an amazing job,” Owens said about Mitchell’s dominance. “I can’t praise her enough for how well she’s been doing.” \nKennedy Bryan finished with 10 kills and seven digs, Kenedy McGrath chipped in with 15 digs of her own and Owens tallied three more kills, finishing with an attack percentage of 0.355. \nWith the win, the Hokies improved to 13-6, 4-3 in the ACC, and the loss dropped Clemson to 5-14, 0-7 in the ACC. \n“It was important for us because it’s a team that is below us and we have to make sure that we win those matches,” Riley said. \nThe Hokies continued their ACC play against Georgia Tech on Sunday afternoon except with different results this time, losing 1-3 (22-25, 25-23, 18-25, 20-25). \nIn the first set, the Yellow Jackets took an early 9-5 lead, but Tech was resilient and clawed back to tie the score at 12-12. Scoring went back and forth until Georgia Tech went on a 4-1 run to win the set by the score of 25-22. \nGeorgia Tech setter Rebecca Martin racked up 12 assists in the first set. The Yellow Jackets also totaled 15 kills and 16 digs. \nMitchell tallied 11 assists while Owens added six kills, making no attack errors. Owens held a 0.750 attack percentage in the first set. \nAttack errors were the Hokies’ nemesis in the set. Eight errors on the attacking side made it hard to overcome any rally that the Yellow Jackets started. \n“We had too many unforced errors, their block was pretty good and it was tough to score on them,” Riley said. “We sprayed balls out of bounds, and it gave them point runs they weren’t earning.” \nThe Hokies took a 23-22 lead late in the second set, thanks to an emphatic kill by junior Katie Krueger. After the Yellow Jackets tied it at 23, Bryan put the Hokies ahead with a kill and Owens added a kill to seal the set for the Hokies. \nFor Georgia Tech, Martin added 10 more assists, and Teegan Van Gunst contributed with five kills. The Hokies were propelled by Bryan, who added four kills and three digs in the second set. \nTech improved in the attacking department, making 13 kills and committing only five attack errors. \nThe third and fourth sets started just as the second set ended, with back-and-forth scoring. However, in both of those sets, Georgia Tech was able to sustain some long, critical runs, leading them to victory. \nTwo Yellow Jackets finished with double digits in kills with Van Gunst being one of those players. Van Gunst racked up 23 kills and 14 digs, giving her a double-double. \n“She’s good, she’s crafty, she’s got all the shots. We needed to do a better job of recognizing where she was,” Riley said. \nFor Tech, freshman blocker Jaila Tolbert tallied a career-high 10 kills in the match, and Mitchell added 41 assists. \nThe Hokies will hit the road for two more ACC matches this coming weekend, facing Wake Forest on Friday and Duke on Sunday. After this weekend, a main point of emphasis for the Hokies will be limiting unforced errors. \n“We can’t give teams points. They’ve got to earn 20 points a set in order to beat us,” Riley said. “If we do that, we’re tough to beat, but if we give everybody 10-12 points per set, anybody could beat us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:55:43.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
