No matter who we are playing against, an Asian side or not, he has really bowled well and taken wickets at the right time and just created a lot of pressure. \n\"Obviously he is a big impact player and we are really confident about him coming back into the side.\" \nThe Pakistan captain is confident too that conditions will be to Yasir's liking. \n\"I think it is a typical Dubai pitch, and should suit us,\" he said. \n\"This venue is better suited for spinners (than Abu Dhabi) and result-oriented. \n\"The team which plays spin well and have better spinners have a good chance.\" \nPakistan got in a tangle against England's spinners in the second innings of the first Test, and were in danger of losing when bad light ended the match. \nMisbah said: \"We should not repeat the mistakes we committed in the first game. \n\"We have to respect their bowlers, (after the way) Adil (Rashid) and Moeen (Ali) bowled on the last day. \n\"We have to be very cautious and play better. \n\"We have posted good totals and saved the matches on the last day many times. \n\"It was just one odd day, and I think we have to forget it but ... be really professional in the next game.\" \nHe knows already, one match in, that England are set to put up more of a fight than they did on their only previous campaign here - when they lost 3-0 under Andrew Strauss in early 2012. \nMisbah added: \"This is very important Test for us. \n\"We have to improve our performance. \n\"They are a professional team and are very determined. \n\"They have learned from their mistakes in the past and are a totally different team ... so we have to lift our performance if we want to win.\" \nPakistan will again be without key batsman Azhar Ali. He missed the first Test with an infected foot and will not be available for the second, having returned home following the death of his mother-in-law.
