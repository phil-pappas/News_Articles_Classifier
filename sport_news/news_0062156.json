(Carson-Newman)-- Over the last few years the game between Carson-Newman (5-2, 3-2 South Atlantic Conference) and Newberry (3-4, 1-3 SAC) has been a slugfest where the outcome was never in doubt. The complete opposite was true in Saturday's game between the two teams. \nThe Eagles got big defensive plays when they needed them which included two blocked field goal attempts as they prevailed over the Wolves 27-20, reversing the trend in the recent series where the average margin of victory had been just under 21 points. \nThe two teams put up impressive offensive numbers as the Eagles out-gained the Wolves 478-460. De'Andre Thomas (Milledgeville, Ga.) was a monster for the Eagles as he threw for 189 yards on 8-of-18 passing and ran 15 times for 165 yards for his eighth career 100-yard rushing performance. But the scoring punch came from Damian Baker (Columbus, Miss.) who scored four times for the Eagles. \nNewberry quarterback Raleigh Yeldell (Edgefield, S.C.) was 26-of-39 for 262 yards to lead the Wolves' attack. Romelo Doctor (Summerville, S.C.) toted the ball 24 times for 108 yards and a touchdown and Yeldell had two rushing touchdowns on 11 carries. \nSha'heem Stupart (Taylors, S.C.) was once again the anchor of the Eagles' defense as he had 11 tackles. Justin Long (Kingsport, Tenn.) recorded two block field goals for Carson-Newman. Arnez Gray (Greenwood, S.C.) led Newberry with 10 tackles as did Jalen Hunter (Seneca, S.C.). \nC-N head coach Ken Sparks, who saw his team score the 14,000th point of his career during the win over the Wolves, said his squad showed resiliency all day long. \n\"The will of our kids and the fact they had some 'want-to' carried us,\" Sparks said. \"I think we did a great job of rallying when sometimes we made some mistakes. We would come up with a big play. We are growing up some because this was a good football team we played today.\" \nThe Eagles were on the board in no time to start the game, taking only 74 seconds to score. Thomas uncorked a 49-yard bomb to Grant Janeway (Johnson City, Tenn.) to move the ball to the Newberry three yard line and Baker scored the first of his four touchdowns on the next play. Carson Wise's (Blacksburg, Va.) point after made it 7-0. \nCarson-Newman scored again on the next to last play of the third quarter. Baker had a 20-yard scamper to set the Eagles up in good field position at the Newberry six. Two plays later, Baker found pay dirt again. Wise's kick this time was blocked by Brice Green (Irmo, S.C.) but the Eagles still led 13-0. \nThe next C-N scoring play was set up when Thomas found TraShaun Ward (Miami, Fla.) for 73 yards to the Wolves' seven yard line. Baker had score number three with a one yard plunge to make it 20-0 as the Eagles were rolling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:55:01.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
