Some have even gone in and out of Major League Baseball, including Jeff Francis, Team Canada's starting pitcher, who is currently signed to a Minor League contract with Toronto. \nCBC Sports reached out to members of Canada's Pan Am baseball rosters to hear their reactions to the Blue Jays first playoffs run in 20 years. \nAutumn Mills, Team Canada pitcher and outfielder: \n\"Baseball and the Jays are two of the most valued things in my life,\" said Mills, who was born into a season ticket-holding family and watches 162 games a year. \nMills thinks her reaction was less surprised than others seemed to be. \n\"Once we picked up [shortstop Troy Tulowitzki,] I knew things were on the up and up,\" said Mills. \"The talent on the team is second to none but I think what really does it for them this year is the comradery. Having played at an elite level I know how beneficial that can be so it wasn't surprising to me that they've made it this far.\" \nAshley Stephenson, Team Canada third baseman: \n\"I've been a Jays fan for as long as I can remember! I grew up watching [Roberto] Alomar, [John] Olerud, [Kelly] Gruber and tried to be just like them! \n\"I remember going to a World Series game where [Pat] Borders hit a home run just over the left field fence and my favourite player, Gruber, dove into home plate and skinned his chin ... It was the most memorable game I have ever watched. \n\"I love how the entire country is rallying behind the Jays. It's great for the Jays but it's also great for baseball in Canada.\" \nKate Psota, Team Canada pitcher: \"I was very young for the 92' and 93' seasons but I do remember a bit of the hype around their very successful years back then. The quality of the ball all through August and September was incredible and whether they won or lost I found myself invested in the games. \n\"You can count on me wearing my Jays hat to work on game days.\" \nAmanda Asay, Team Canada pitcher/first baseman: \n\"When they clinched a playoff spot my main reaction was excitement mixed with a little bit of relief,\" said Asay. \n\"It has been so long since the Jays last playoff run the excitement has really spread through the whole country. I live out in Vancouver and can't go a day without seeing someone in fan gear or hear someone talking about these Jays.\" @YahooCanadaNews on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook You Might Like »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:24:09.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
