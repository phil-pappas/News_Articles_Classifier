Earlier this year the company had announced a similar partnership with the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA),\" a media release from KSCA said on Saturday (October 17).

Thomson is arguably the fastest bowler to have played international cricket. With an unusual slinging action, and an aggressive approach, he was a fearsome sight to batsmen in the 70s and early 80s. \nOn this occasion, Vighnesh Shahane, CEO of IDBI Federal Life Insurance said, \"As an organisation we use sports as a platform to inspire positive actions. After the successful launch of MCA - IDBI Federal Life Insurance Bowling Foundation, this association with KSCA is truly exciting for us.\" \n\"It is a wonderful moment for us at KSCA to be inking this deal with IDBI-Federal Life Insurance bowling foundation with Jeff Thomson. With our constant endeavour to provide better training, we have many youngsters in various age groups who are being nurtured. To be groomed by one of famed fast bowlers from yesteryears will be a dream come true for many youngsters\", said Brijesh Patel , secretary of KSCA. \n\"We believe this will be a long-term relationship in which youngsters from the State will benefit and become better bowlers for the state and country\", he added. \nWhile thanking IDBI Federal Life Insurance, Dr. Makarand Waingankar, Director, Cricket Operations, Excellence in Cricket (EIC), said, \"IDBI Federal's keenness to establish the bowling foundation and KSCA's extensive support will truly help EIC develop the bowling stars of tomorrow. This will be a great contribution to domestic as well as international cricket. \n\"This foundation will not only help KSCA spot the talent but will also facilitate its training under top coaches in the country. With Jeff Thomson's association, the KSCA - IDBI Federal Life Insurance Bowling Foundation will truly become a springboard for future success for these bowlers.\" \nIDBI Federal Life Insurance has also announced the launch of the â€˜IDBI Federal Life Insurance Frank Tyson Memorial Scholarship'. This scholarship will be awarded to 2 performing bowlers per year in the age group of 17 to 19 years. \nOneIndia News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:27:12.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
