I felt very honored to be part of that. It's never goodbye. It's see you later.\"\nChris Tillman (11-11) gave up two runs and seven hits over 5 1-3 innings to level his lifetime record against New York at 6-6.\nThe victory completed a three-game sweep for the Orioles against a team headed to the playoffs. Despite the loss, the Yankees will host Houston on Tuesday in the AL wild-card game because the Astros missed a chance to play at home by losing to Arizona on Sunday.\nBaltimore went 10-9 against New York this year. After going 13-6 last year, the Orioles have won successive season series against the Yankees for the first time since 1981-82.\nBaltimore finished 81-81 after winning the AL East last year with a 96-66 record. Although they missed the playoffs, the Orioles were in contention for a wild-card berth until the final week and closed with a five-game winning streak to avoid what would have been their first losing season since 2011.\n\"This time of year you reach for small victories,\" Showalter said. \"They didn't give in. I know there were a lot of teams counting on us to play the way we played. For that, I'm really proud.\"\nOrioles third baseman Manny Machado failed to homer in a fifth consecutive game but completed the season as the only player in the majors to participate in all 162 games.\nBaltimore went up 2-0 in the first inning when pending free agent Matt Wieters hit a two-run, two-out single.\nIt was an emotional game for Wieters, too.\n\"Every offseason, for the most part, if you're not a free agent, you think you'll be back,\" Wieters said. \"But this is the first offseason where it could be anyone. I loved every second I've spent here and I loved everybody in this clubhouse, and I loved all the fans. If it ends today, it was a great time.\"\nTRAINER'S ROOM\nOrioles: CF Adam Jones (back) and 2B Jonathan Schoop (hand) watched from the dugout, although manager Buck Showalter said, \"Both are capable of doing something for us today.\"\nON DECK\nYankees: New York will send right-hander Masahiro Tanaka (12-7, 3.51 ERA) to the mound on Tuesday.\nOrioles: Baltimore heads into an important offseason uncertain if this was the final game as Orioles for pending free agents Wieters, Davis, Darren O'Day and Wei-Yin Chen.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
