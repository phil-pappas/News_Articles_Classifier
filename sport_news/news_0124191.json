The three-year soccer player did so with her brother, Nick, who had kicked for three years for the Indians before graduating this past spring. “Her brother was a man of very few words so it was kind of an awkward talk at first,” Grove said with a smile. Grove said if she wanted to, why not? Veillette came out for spring football and “was great,” according to Grove, hitting 9 of her 10 attempts on a daily basis and also did well in the spring game. Grove liked what he saw, but, cognizant of the fact that she was a three-year soccer player, he recommended she talk with April Parady before making the commitment. “She told me she met with (Parady) and she understood, that Montville (girls soccer) had a young team and wished her well if she wanted to go do it,” Grove said. On Thursday night, Veillette was a perfect 4-for-4 on extra points against East Lyme. She became the first female player, according to Grove, to score a point for the Indians football program, is the first female kicker on the team and is now a member of a short list of female players for Montville. “Nerves definitely kick in when the boys are all hyping me up. If I miss, I let them down and I don’t want to do that,” Veillette said. Veillette had two previous attempts prior to the East Lyme game, but her extra point attempt versus Stonington was blocked and a snap was mishandled against Plainfield. Veillette said her brother’s graduation sparked her interest to get involved. “If he was leaving, I felt like I needed to come and take his position and keep up the Veillette tradition,” she said. Grove said he and his coaching staff give Veillette the same type of grief that the male athletes get and, sometimes, a bit more since everyone is watching when she goes on to the field. “At first it’s an adjustment,” Grove admitted to having a female player on the team. “We have a profanity rule at practices and games, but I have had to modify it to include no suggestive talk. But they have really embraced her as one of the team.” It was a good thing that she did come out for football as the Indians truly didn’t have a kicker. Cody Calash and a few other guys had the potential to kick for Montville. Page 2 of 4 - “It didn’t look pretty. It was the toe style, just get it in there. She came out and, you can see, she can get it done,” Grove said. Disconcerting discourse Windham coach Brian Crudden was not happy on Friday night. His team had just defeated Plainfield, but their discipline on the field left something to be desired. Late in the first half, the Whippets were hit with two unsportsmanlike penalties in a row and had a personal foul at the beginning of the third quarter. It’s not the first time that Windham’s mouths have got them into trouble this season. “No doubt about it,” Crudden said when asked if he was concerned about the lack of discipline on the team. “They don’t seem to get it and it’s getting old. Just shut your mouth and play. That bothers me. Unsportsmanlike penalties, back-to-back, just be quiet and play football.” Crudden said he and his staff don’t coach the players to talk “junk.” “But they do, sometimes. I think they see it too much on TV. It’s tough to overcome, but I’m going to keep working on it,” Crudden said. Windham senior Seiji Arzuaga agreed. “We just have to stop talking and let our play do the talking,” Arzuaga said. Road tested As the only Eastern Connecticut Conference football team without lights at its home field, Bacon Academy plays many fewer night games than the rest of their conference foes. After opening the season with three Saturday afternoon home games, the Bobcats played their first evening game at Stonington on Friday, an 18-6 victory in the rain and wind. Bacon quarterback Sean Kelly was more worried about the unfavorable conditions than when and where the game was played. “No, I don’t think (playing on the road) really had an effect. I think it was mainly the weather because it was cold as hell out here, it was freezing and the wind was crazy, it was taking the ball everywhere but a lot of receivers made some nice plays and (the win) felt great,” Kelly said. Bacon coach Erik Larka was more concerned with getting his players focused on the upcoming game after the Bobcats picked up a couple of big wins. “This week the kids seemed a little bit flat in practice and I think coming off two huge wins (over New London and Ledyard) they were just emotionally drained this week,” Larka said. Page 3 of 4 - Larka knew that with the conditions playing into the Bears’ running attack and Stonington desperate for a win, the Bobcats could not take the game lightly. “I think playing Stonington, and we stressed this is a proud program, they’re traditionally a seven-eight win program, they’re going to come to kick our butt if we don’t bring it,” Larka said. “And our kids learned quick, and luckily the defense kept us in it long enough for the offense to score a couple points to pull it out.” Looking for tempo NFA entered play Friday with five players already getting at least one carry in its first two games, not including quarterback Jawaun Johnson. In Friday’s win over Griswold, the Wildcats added a sixth. Senior Peyton Whittaker became the latest player to join NFA’s backfield. While he carried just six time for 27 yards, Whittaker, a starting linebacker, gained yardage on every play and looked comfortable finding holes rather than filling them. “Jawaun has helped me out a lot,” Whittaker said. “It’s a pretty complex offense, tough to learn in a week.” NFA coach Jemal Davis said it’s simply a matter of creating depth. “He’s played that position for us in years past,” Davis said. “We just wanted more options. (Deondre) Baker and R.J. (Darby) have been doing a nice job but neither one has the experience Peyton does.” It’s a way to give the NFA offense as many options as possible. Davis has said this offense reminds him of the Wildcats’ 2012 team, one that advanced to a state title game for just the second time in school history (The Wildcats made it a third last season). With Johnson at quarterback, Griffen Gooden at receiver and Keenan Jackson at tight end, the other three skill spots are interchangeable, with Baker, Darby, De’Jean General, Marquis Ward and now Whittaker, sometimes lining up in the backfield or split wide. “If we need to get the tempo going, we have someone with some experience to maybe take some pressure off of Jawaun,” Davis said. Passing flair It’s a strategy that a few teams might try to employ. The Montville Indians basically forced East Lyme to the air, attempting to put the pressure on sophomore quarterback Dylan Hatajik. Vikings coach Rudy Bagos had hoped to open up his offensive attack early in the season, but Hatajik struggled in the preseason. Page 4 of 4 - “That’s when I brought it back down and tried to get a more run-controlled offense,” Bagos said. But the Indians shut that down on Thursday night, limiting the Vikings to just 59 yards rushing. That meant for the Vikings to succeed, Hatajik had to. “He stepped up. I thought he played terrific,” Bagos said. Hatajik finished with 9 completions in 23 attempts for 86 yards and also added the bulk of the rushing yards, 36, for the Vikings. He also got the closest to the end zone, getting bumped out on the 1-yard line by Tyler Price on a bootleg in the closing minute. The Vikings failed to punch it in. “You almost forget, at times, that he’s a sophomore,” Bagos said. “We’re going in there with limited plays and I think other teams know what is going on, but he’s still completing passes. He’s going to be good. He’s going to be a special player. At some point, we will get this going, right the ship and get it back to where we should be.” Silver linings playbook Stonington finds itself in an unfamiliar position with an 0-4 record to start the season, its worst opening mark since an 0-5 start in 2006. Despite the winless mark, Stonington coach A.J. Massengale believes the Bears are heading in the right direction. “There are a lot of kids on a lot of teams that don’t get better when they’re losing games and we have good kids that work hard and they get better,” Massengale said. “I think they understand that you have two options: you either get better or you get worse, and they choose to get better. And it's not about moral victories or anything like that.” Massengale knew that his team would need its best effort to beat Bacon Academy, but turnovers and missed opportunities on short fields left the Bears still seeking their first victory of 2015. “Bacon has a fantastic football team and our kids came out and played incredibly hard, as they have in every single game,” Massengale said. “Their execution is getting better but every week we have things like the turnovers, things like that. We just have to work harder on those things and we’ll keep working at it to improve it.” — Marc Allard, Owen Poole and Jason Levy contributed to this report.
