So does Percy Harvin. Terrance Williams may be lucky just to catch another pass as long as Brandon Weeden is under center.\nOn the other hand, Travis Benjamin and Kendall Wright may stick around awhile.\nBy the third week of the regular season, you begin to see who's for real and who's fool's gold, so it's imperative for fantasy football owners to choose carefully from the waiver wire. It might seem obvious to say, but the right decisions can set up the rest of the season.\nThat sentiment especially stands for fantasy managers dealing with players who, through injuries or ineffectiveness, haven't lived up to their draft position.\nThe following players can help plug holes in your lineup.\n1. Rishard Matthews, WR, Dolphins\nThe man literally has fought to become Miami's leading receiver. Matthews' offseason of frustration came to a head when he got into a scrap with cornerback Jamar Taylor during training camp.\nAt perhaps his worst moment, Matthews packed up his locker the same night the Dolphins drafted DeVante Parker, according to the Palm Beach Post, and demanded the Dolphins trade or release him. Bad blood with the team had been brewing for a long time.\nIn December, coaches deactivated him for the last two games after a shouting match during a meeting. In March, the team traded with New Orleans for Kenny Stills. Matthews was now looking up at Parker, Stills, Jarvis Landry and Greg Jennings from the bottom of the pecking order. He skipped the team's offseason program. He wanted out.\nThe Dolphins didn't give in and it seems like Matthews has had something to prove ever since. He beat out on Stills in camp, though Stills remains ahead of Matthews on the depth chart of the team's official website as of Monday (the Dolphins might want to look into that), and he immediately rose in the ranks among a deep receiving corps.\nMatthews had four catches for 34 yards and a touchdown in Week 1. His targets have gone up two straight weeks since then. He had 115 yards in Week 2 and 113 yards and two scores on Sunday. He leads the Dolphins with 262 yards and three touchdown catches. The Dolphins have five offensive touchdowns -- total.\nIf there are concerns with Matthews, it's that Ryan Tanniehill hasn't looked to him very much in the red zone (though the Dolphins haven't been there often enough to deduce a trend), and he doesn't have much of a track record. In 2013, his best statistical season, he had 41 receptions for 448 yards and two touchdowns. But there's no denying that through three weeks he has been the team's best option to put points on the board.\n2. Tyrod Taylor, QB, Bills\nMost season-long leagues have 10 or 12 teams, and many of them carry two quarterbacks on their roster. So it mystifies me that Taylor is owned in only about 28 percent of NFL leagues and about 44 percent of leagues run by ESPN. There aren't 20-24 better quarterbacks than Taylor right now, especially given the three big names (Tony Romo, Ben Roethlisberger, Drew Brees) that have gone down with injuries. He has a quarterback rating of 116.1 through three games.\nSkeptics might believe the mobile Taylor is simply padding his stats by running the ball. Based on his rushing and passing attempts, he has run 18 percent of the time. Aaron Rodgers has run it 15 percent of his total attempts. In any event, it doesn't matter as long as Taylor's production remains consistent. Six of Taylor's remaining opponents rank in the top 15 of fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks, and four are in the top 10.\n3. Antonio Andrews, RB, Titans\nLet's be frank here. Andrews isn't regarded as a talented diamond in the rough, and the Titans may not be destined to have a respectable running game this season. But Andrews just has to be better than Bishop Sankey to have fantasy value, which doesn't look to be a tall order.\nIn his first action of the season, Andrews carried 12 times for 49 yards and a touchdowns, a 4.1 yards per carry average compared to Sankey's 4.3). Andrews is a more compact, physical runner. He also had a 13-yard touchdown called back on penalty.\nBut Andrews amounts to a desperation pick. It's speculative to think that Andrews will get the bulk of the workload, even in the red zone. David Cobb, perhaps the most talented back on the roster, is designated to return from his injury midseason.\nBut if Andrews does provide the Titans a boost on the ground, it could pay off for his fantasy owners, at least in the short term. The team ranks third (tied with Green Bay) in red zone scoring attempts per game (4.3), according to teamrankings.com.\n4. Marvin Jones, WR, Bengals\nJones is owned in 1.1 percent of nfl.com leagues: How can this be? He has scored more 28 fantasy points this season, which isn't a big number, but it's more production than we've seen so far from Calvin Johnson, T.Y. Hilton and Sammy Watkins. Jones had a big year in 2013 (10 touchdowns) but missed last season with foot and ankle injuries.\n5. Lance Dunbar, RB, Cowboys\nWhat did we learn from the Cowboys-Falcons game? The field shrinks when Weeden is at the helm. That's bad news if you have Terrance Williams, but good news if you have or can pick up Dunbar, a safe check-down option for Weeden. Dunbar had career highs of 10 catches and 100 receiving yards Sunday and makes a great PPR flex option.\n6. Thomas Rawls, RB, Seahawks\nNorthern Illinois fans probably remember when the former Central Michigan back ran over the Huskies for 270 yards last October. On Sunday, the undrafted rookie backup ran for 104 yards, making him the first 100-yard rusher against the Bears this season. He's a worth a flier on the chance Marshawn Lynch's hamstring and calf issues continue to nag him.\n7. Charles Clay, TE, Bills\nHe has scored two weeks in a row and he looks like he's building a connection with Taylor. Clay looked like a breakout candidate with the Dolphins last season but didn't fully live up to expectations. Perhaps the change in scenery and a more dynamic quarterback will boost his stats.\n8. Leonard Hankerson, WR, Falcons\nHe's the team's second leading receiver with 138 yards -- a distant second to Julio Jones (440), but still second -- and he's the only other Falcon besides Jones to catch a touchdown pass. Roddy White has only four catches on nine targets, and he hasn't even seen a pass from Matt Ryan in the last two games. It doesn't hurt that Hankerson's familiar with offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan from their Redskins days.\n9. Michael Vick, QB, Steelers\nVick was a late summer addition to the Steelers, so he hasn't spent a lot of time in their system. The playbook likely will be simplified for Vick with the objective of making him a game manager and cutting down on his penchant for turning the ball over, which he almost did twice in relief of Roethlisberger on Sunday.\nVick ranks right around Matthew Stafford and Ryan Tannehill in all-time touchdown-to-interception ratio, according to footballdb.com. In other words, not great. Still, Vick is surrounded by playmakers such as Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell who can turn short passes into big plays. Just don't expect anything close to Big Ben's numbers.\n10. Seth Roberts, WR, Raiders\nLook who found the end zone in two straight weeks. Roberts may be a fluke or he may be a role player in an emerging offense. There's really not enough to go on right now. The Bears defense may not provide much of a gauge either, but at least they make Roberts worth a one-week flier.\nBONUS:\nCaleb Sturgis, K, Eagles\nCody Parkey kicked last week with a torn goin muscles, which, besides showing he has amazing pain tolerance, means he's on injured reserve. It gives Sturgis a second chance after being released by the Dolphins this summer. Eagles kickers usually get plenty of opportunities to put up numbers.\nplthompson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ _phil_thompson\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Roddy White Pittsburgh Steelers Dallas Cowboys Marshawn Lynch Matthew Stafford Matt Ryan", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://twitter.com/_phil_thompson", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560be358/turbine/ct-week-4-fantasy-football-waiver-wire-rankings-20150929"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:05:06.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
