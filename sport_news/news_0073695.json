The busiest location is the start/finish area, which is in the heart of downtown at Southwest Fourth Avenue and Taylor Street.\nDue to the length of the course and the number of participants, which should top 10,000 in the full and half marathons, traffic issues will be felt around the city as the runners make their way from downtown through west Portland, across the Willamette River on the St. John's Bridge, then return along the east side with a river crossing on the Broadway Bridge.\nStuart Tomlinson of The Oregonian/OregonLive.com summarized the bridge disruptions with this post published Wednesday: Sunday's Portland Marathon means delays, lane closures on downtown bridges , freeway ramps.\nRecommended bridges to cross the Willamette River on Sunday are Fremont, Hawthorne, Ross Island, Marquam and Steel bridges. TriMet posts its service changes for the marathon on its website.\nTraffic conditions should return to near normal about 3 p.m., an hour and a half after the last finishers are directed off the roadways onto sidewalks to make their way to the finish line.\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": ["http://news.trimet.org/2014/10/portland-marathon-to-impact-trimet-service-sunday-2/"], "published": "2015-10-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:13:32.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
