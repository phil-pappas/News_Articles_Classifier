'His jab was magnificent.' \nThe 33 year-old's record has now stretched to 34 fights without defeat, including 21 stoppages in a row. To put that into context, his knock-out percentage is now better than Mike Tyson's following the same amount of bouts. \nHis Canadian opponent certainly had his moments – a flurry of activity late in the fifth had Golovkin on his toes – yet , in truth, the result was never doubt and when referee Steve Willis finally stepped in with one minute 28 seconds left in the eighth, Lemieux's corner could have no arguments. \nUltimately, the stats told a story of pure and utter dominance from the best, and most exciting, pound-for-pound talent on the planet. He connected with 280 out of 549 punches thrown compared to Lemieux's total of hitting with just 89 of 335. \nGolovokin averaged 21 jabs a round – a rate Lemieux, let alone anyone else, was able to cope with. (Compubox stats revealed that was, incredibly, four times the middleweight average.) \nWhat happens next will prove equally as fascinating and undoubtedly more dramatic. \nThe next so called superfight this side of the Atlantic will see Miguel Cotto and Canelo Alverez meet in November with the newly unified middleweight champion of the world surely awaiting the winner. Irishman Andy Lee, the WBO title holder, could be another interesting option. \nThat, however, is for then.On this evidence, no-one would relish entering the ring with Triple G. \n'I am so proud to have unified the belts on what was a huge night for me, ' said Golovkin. \n'That was my goal. What happens next, will happen. I am making a new story for myself. Myself and David had a different style but I was ready for anything. I have respect for Cotto and Canelo. We will see.' \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
