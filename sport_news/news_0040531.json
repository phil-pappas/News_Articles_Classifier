The Longhorns were able to hang on after going up 14-0 early, on a 24-yard shovel pass from Jerrod Heard to Marcus Johnson followed by a Kirk Johnson special teams fumble recovery that led to a short field and a 2-yard rushing touchdown by Tyrone Swoopes. \nTexas put two rushers over 100 yards in the win. Heard ran for 115 yards on 21 carries while freshman D’Onta Foreman carried it nine times for 117 yards, including an 81-yard fourth-quarter run that set up Swoopes’ 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end and converted defensive lineman Caleb Bluiett that put Texas ahead 24-10. \nFreshman linebacker and Mesquite Poteet product Malik Jefferson recorded two sacks in the upset win that seemed so improbable after the Longhorns’ 50-7 loss last week at TCU. \nPlayers of the game: Foreman was the stronger of Texas’ two running backs all afternoon, as he has been for most of the season. Though he did not reach the end zone, his 81-yard run early in the fourth was the longest by a Longhorn in the 110 meetings between Texas and OU. Tyrone Swoopes was used in a power goalline package and was responsible for two of Texas’ scores. \nRecords: Oklahoma 4-1, 1-1 Big 12; Texas 2-4, 1-2 Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:34:56.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
