How about “Checkermate?” \nCedar Rapids Prairie’s boys dominated Thursday’s Class 4A state-qualifying cross country meet at Seminole Valley Park. Tysen VanDraska, Cam Steffens and Jake Moore ran 1-2-3, and the other two scorers finished in the top 10 as the Hawks blew the doors off the competition. \nThe Hawks were state champions in 2013, runners-up in 2014 and appear to be in position to challenge for the crown again. \n“It’s going to take a great day for us to win it,” VanDraska said. “But at the end of the day, I think we’re going to be proud of what we did.” \nThe Hawks literally ran away from the field, scoring 22 points. Dubuque Hempstead (69) and Iowa City West (74) gained the other two state slots. \nPrairie’s foursome of VanDraska, Steffens, Moore and Chris Oehlert ran to the front of the pack in their familiar white and orange checker-board singlets. A fan viewed them through binoculars behind the lead cart and yelled, to whoever was listening, “Here come the checkers!” \nHere they came, and there they went. VanDraska finished in 15:39, Steffens in 15:52, Moore in 15:57. Oehlert was sixth, Colton Lagrange 10th. \n“I guess I was in charge of keeping the pace,” VanDraska said. “Coach (Bill Schwarz) told us to go out together, then see what we had at the end.” \nThe state meet is Oct. 31 at Kennedy Park, Fort Dodge. The top three teams and top 15 individuals from each site Thursday advanced. \nMuscatine edged Iowa City West, 49-55, for the girls’ title. Dubuque Hempstead (92) earned the third spot. \nFreshman Reagan Gorman of Cedar Rapids Washington took individual honors among the girls, pulling away from the pack in the second mile and crossing the finish line in 18:58. Hannah Fusselman of Cedar Rapids Kennedy was second in 19:03. \n“I wanted to maintain a good pace,” Gorman said. “I wanted to keep going fast, so I took the lead. I was comfortable, so if anybody caught me, I was going to be able to run with them.” \nGorman was generously measured at 5-foot-2 for her physical —“I’m a little skeptical about that,” she said — and 90 pounds. But she is making a big impact in her rookie season. \n“My first year, I’d like to finish in the top 10,” she said. \nBailey Nock and Tia Saunders ran 3-4 for West. Cedar Rapids Jefferson’s Meredith Koenigsfeld and Sarah Hanna were sixth and ninth. \nWest’s Patrick Karanja and Kolby Greiner were fourth and seventh in the boys’ race. Samuel Eck of Washington was eighth. \nCLASS 4A STATE-QUALIFYING CROSS COUNTRY MEET \nAt Seminole Valley Park \nGirls Results \nTeams (top 3 qualify for state) — 1. Muscatine 49, 2.
