Lord Rama fought a war with Ravana to have Sita released from captivity. He defeated Ravana and killed him.\nThis episode is celebrated as Dussehra in many parts of India, with effigies of Ravana and his brothers Kumbhkaran and Meghnath being burnt.\nBaijnath, located at 4,311 feet, is a small town located amid the scenic Dhauladhar mountain range of the Himalayas. The temple is believed to have seen uninterrupted worship since its construction in 1204 A.D.\nThe shrine is a beautiful example of the early medieval north Indian temple architecture known as Nagara style of architecture. It's a protected monument maintained by the Archeological Survey of India. â€”IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:19:18.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
