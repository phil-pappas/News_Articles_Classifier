Gatti then berated and shoved a UConn dining hall manager. Finally, Gatti was taken down by another staff member and arrested by police.\nThe student’s two-and-a-half minute video begins by apologizing to that employee who he accosted.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below “He was just doing his job. He gave me so many chances to walk away, and I didn’t listen to him,” Gatti says in the apology video. “No one deserves to be treated that way – ever. At the time I was, to say the least, very intoxicated.”\n[ Warning: Mild language ]\nGatti said he watched the video and felt “ashamed” of himself.\n“I was just watching it thinking, ‘Oh my God, what the hell is wrong with me?’” he said. “This was seriously a wake-up call.”\nHe also directs an apology to his friends, family, and the UConn student body for making them all look bad. Finally, Gatti had one piece of advice before signing off.\n“To all those who want to send donations of mac and cheese to me, please just send it to your local food pantry,” he says.\nGallery: The best hangover brunches around Boston.\nPrevious -- of -- Next Canary Square: A great drink list and a brunch menu that changes with the seasons are but two of the things that make this JP spot great—but when you’re hungover, get the brunch fries.
