We know the energy is going to be great either in LA or New York, and obviously in Chicago.\"\nIf it's Los Angeles, Arrieta will be returning to the scene of his Aug. 30 no-hitter. If it's New York, the Cubs will go in with a chance to avenge the saddest chapter in team history, the 1969 collapse at the hands of the Mets.\nBut it probably doesn't matter much which team they play at this point. The Cubs are the hottest team in baseball, and some experts now consider them the favorites to win the World Series.\nGoing by records, playing the Mets theoretically would be an easier road to the World Series. The Cubs went 7-0 against them this season — including a four-game sweep at Wrigley in mid-May — their first season series sweep of the Mets in Cubs history.\nBut the last time the teams met was June 30-July 2 at Citi Field in New York, when Cubs pitchers allowed only one run in the three-game sweep, leaving the Mets with a 40-40 record.\nThat was before the Mets acquired outfielder Yoenis Cespedes from the Tigers and went on a second-half tear to win the NL East easily, finishing 89-73.\nThe Cubs went 3-4 against the Dodgers in 2015, going 2-1 at Wrigley and 1-3 on the road. But they hit only .217 with a .284 on-base percentage off Dodgers pitching, with 70 strikeouts in those seven games. Clayton Kershaw struck out 14 Cubs on Aug. 28 in Los Angeles, allowing one run on three hits over eight innings.\nAs for October history, the Cubs never have played the Mets in the postseason, and the Dodgers swept them in their last postseason appearance in 2008.\nThat memorable NLDS ended in Dodger Stadium with a Cubs player flooding the dugout after hitting the pipes with a bat.\nBoth the Dodgers and Mets have quality starting pitching, with the Dodgers' one-two punch of Kershaw and Zack Greinke considered the best in the game. Greinke figures to be Arrieta's closest rival in the Cy Young Award voting, which could go either way.\nGreinke is pitching Thursday night against the Mets' Jacob deGrom, while Kershaw won Game 4 on Tuesday in Citi Field, saving the Dodgers' season.\nIf they stick to their playoff rotations for Saturday, the Mets likely would go with Noah Syndergaard while the Dodgers would start Brett Anderson. Jon Lester, who was 1-0 with a 2.08 ERA against the Mets this season, likely will get the nod from the Cubs. He was 0-2 with an 8.10 ERA in two starts against the Dodgers.\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets Los Angeles Dodgers Jake Arrieta Clayton Kershaw", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561f1c9a/turbine/ct-cubs-dodgers-or-met-spt-1015-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:53:00.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
