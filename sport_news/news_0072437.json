If Sean Payton’s squad hopes to resurrect its season, it begins tonight in Primetime against the Dallas Cowboys. With Carolina and Atlanta both winning Sunday to each remain undefeated at 4-0, the Saints can ill afford to fall four games back. Here are some keys to victory: 1. Drew Brees is back, offense needs to get healthy Last week, Brees missed his first game due to injury since joining the Saints in 2006. Apparently one was enough for his shoulder to get healthy, but was a few days of practice enough for the Saints offense to do the same? In Brees’ two starts this season – losses to Arizona and Tampa Bay – the Saints offense struggled mightily, scoring just 19 point in each contest. If New Orleans has any chance of pulling out a victory tonight, it’ll need to kick the offense into high gear. The receivers have to do a much better job getting open and the offensive line has to keep Brees from running for his life and off his back. He can’t afford to get smacked around. Furthermore, the Saints ground game needs to finally get going. As a team, they’re averaging just 3.2 yards per carry, with Mark Ingram leading the way with 39 carries for 127 yards and two touchdowns. Tonight will be the first game the Saints “Big Three” of Ingram, Khiry Robinson and C. J. Spiller are all 100 percent healthy. Payton says Spiller will have an increased workload tonight, which could be a huge bonus. Here’s a bonus: Brees needs just two touchdown passes for 400 in his career and nine completions for 5,000. That would rank him fifth and third, respectively, in NFL history. 2. Defense is finally healthy It’s official the Jairus Byrd is back! The safety who missed all of training camp and didn’t reappear until last week will finally suit up. Also back for the first time this season: linebacker Dannell Ellerbe, and cornerback and New Orleanian Keenan Lewis. The Saints now have depth at cornerback, so it will be interesting to see how that unit shifts with now that it’s at full strength. All three players will probably be somewhat limited in their first game back, but their mere presence alone should give the team a huge boost. 3. Explosive plays: produce them while preventing them The Saints are the worst in the NFL when it comes to explosive plays (runs of 10 yards or longer, or passes of 25 yards or longer). The offense didn’t produce a single explosive play against Carolina last week, and has just seven all season (4 runs against Tampa Bay, 3 passes against Arizona), while allowing 21 on defense. The Saints will not only have to be more explosive on the offensive end, but they’ll also have to stop Dallas. If New Orleans can keep a positive explosive play differential, they’ll greatly increase their chances of picking up that first win.
