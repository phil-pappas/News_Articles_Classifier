I love driving this car and I love where we are at the moment.\" \nWith four races to go, Hamilton leads Vettel by 66 points and Rosberg by 73. \nHamilton expressed sympathy for Rosberg, saying he had also been hindered by a problem with the rear of the car. \"We are struggling\" with reliability, Hamilton said. \"Nico's been incredibly unfortunate to suffer the worst.\" \nFor the second year running, Hamilton received his winner's trophy from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who also greeted the top three drivers ahead of the podium ceremony. \nVettel was forced into a prolonged battle with his Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen early on, eventually passing the Finn in a tight move up the inside. \n\"I think we both enjoyed it. Obviously, I came out in front, so I enjoyed it a little bit more than him,\" Vettel said. \"He was giving me just enough room to survive, so it was a good battle.\" \nRaikkonen's collision with Bottas elevated Perez to third. Raikkonen crossed the line in fifth with heavy damage but was then given a 30-second penalty that dropped him to eighth. \nThat gave Mercedes an unassailable 172-point lead over Ferrari in the constructors' championship. \nBottas and Raikkonen both passed Perez for third and fourth place respectively, before Raikkonen attempted a poorly-judged move on the inside to take third from Bottas, spinning the Williams driver into the wall. \nPerez's third place was the best finish this year for Force India. \n\"I'm going through a great moment in my career,\" Perez said. \"I was confident going into the race (but) obviously not expecting a podium at all.\" \nFelipe Massa was fourth for Williams, with Russian driver Daniil Kvyat elevated to fifth by Raikkonen's penalty in a pleasing result for the home crowd. Felipe Nasr of Sauber and Pastor Maldonado of Lotus were six and seventh, ahead of the demoted Raikkonen. \nThe two McLarens of Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso rounded out the top 10 in what is only the second time this season that the troubled team has had both drivers finish in the points. \nFollowing his retirement on lap 7, Rosberg said his throttle pedal had stuck on, leaving him worried about his safety. \n\"I couldn't come off throttle any more, so I was doing all the corners with throttle on,\" he said. \"I was trying to take my leg off the pedal but then my knee would come up and I couldn't steer any more.\" \nHowever, Rosberg refused to abandon his dwindling title hopes. \n\"You just have to be realistic now. (The gap to Hamilton) is a lot of points. It doesn't change my approach, still pushing to the maximum and committed. Going for it mentally,\" he said. \nHamilton has 302 points, Vettel is second with 236 and Rosberg has 229. No other driver is in contention. With a maximum of 100 points still available, Hamilton could retain the title at the next race in the United States on Oct. 25. \nVettel was surprised by an intruder on the track in Singapore last month and had another close encounter in Sochi, speeding past as a Russian marshal gathered debris from the track. \nTwo major accidents brought out the safety car in the early stages. \nThe fight for the lead on the first lap between Hamilton and Rosberg was almost immediately curtailed by a first-lap incident when Nico Hulkenberg's Force India span, collecting the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson. Both were left stranded, bringing out the safety car. \nOn lap 12, Romain Grosjean lost control of his Lotus and hurtled into the barriers at high speed, wrecking the car. Despite the violence of the impact, Grosjean was uninjured. \nToro Rosso's Carlos Sainz Jr., who was only cleared to race by doctors on Sunday morning following a heavy crash in practice, started last. The Spaniard stormed through the field into the top 10, but his race ended late on when his brakes overheated. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
