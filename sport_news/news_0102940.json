Hougland finished first but was disqualified. (Photo: Joanna McCoy/Special to the Register) \nZach Hougland's decision to help a fallen runner cost him a cross country state qualifying meet title. \nIt also demonstrated a lesson in sportsmanship and sacrifice. \nThe Davis County of Bloomfield senior finished first in Thursday's meet at Columbus Junction, but was later disqualified when he aided an opponent who collapsed near the finish line -- an interference that violated state rules. \nHougland, who was ranked seventh among the state's Class 2A runners, crossed the finish line first, apparently winning his first district championship and earning his fourth trip to the state meet, which will be held Oct. 31 in Fort Dodge. \nHe turned to look back at the course and saw Mediapolis senior Garret Hinson struggling in distress. Hinson was about 150 meters short of the finish line. \n\"Is anyone going to help him?\" Hougland shouted. \nHinson, whose legs and back were giving out, dropped to his knees and was crawling on all fours toward the finish. \nTaking the initiative, Hougland ran to Hinson's side. He helped Hinson to his feet and guided him for a few steps before the Mediapolis runner reached the end of the race. \n\"I just couldn't stand seeing that,\" Hougland said. \nBoth runners were disqualified. Hinson, a senior, was ranked No. 21 in Class 2A. \n\"It was kind of all a blur,\" Hinson said. \"I was moving in slow motion. Someone said, 'disqualified.' \" \nFortunately for him, Hougland, who was praised for his sportsmanship by fans and runners, will still be able to run at the state meet. He will be eligible to compete for a state title, too. Davis County's boys' team took third and qualified for state despite losing its top athlete in Thursday's meet. \nHinson, a senior, had been trying to earn a spot in the state meet, too. He pushed himself to near the front -- the top 15 place winners qualify for state as well as the top three teams -- but saw about 30 runners pass him as he collapsed. \nHe said he felt Hougland's arms guide him upright. The action violated state rules regarding physical assistance of one runner by another. \n\"If it weren't for this, I would have ended up crawling (to the finish line) or falling multiple times,\" Hinson said. \"He was sportsmanlike and very selfless. Almost courageous.\" \nThe help was ruled interference by a runner. The disqualification was made by meet officials. An investigation by the Iowa High School Athletic Association upheld the ruling, according to Association assistant director Jared Chizek. \n\"When he provided assistance to the young man from Mediapolis, he interfered with another runner,\" Chizek said. \"Unfortunately, this is against the rules.\" \nDisqualifications due to one runner helping another have occurred in Minnesota, Kansas and North Dakota meets in recent years, Chizek said. \nChizek said he received 15 to 20 comments from people complaining about the decision. Social media buzzed complimented Hougland's behavior. \nHougland said he figured he had a \"20 to 25 percent chance\" of being disqualified due to his action. He believed that because he didn't help Hinson across the finish line, he may have been permitted to stay in the top spot. \nHe grew concerned when, after the meet, he learned the coaches were holding a meeting. \nDavis County of Bloomfield qualified for the state cross country meet despite losing its top runner to a disqualification. (Photo: Josh Husted/Special to the Register) \n\"Oh great, here it is,\" Hougland said he thought, before walking away from his teammates so they wouldn't see him get emotional. \nHinson and his family visited Hougland after the race. Hinson offered an apology. Hougland said he would want someone to do the same act for him. \n\"We kind of hugged it out,\" Hinson said. \nLater, on the team bus, Davis County coach Josh Husted asked Hougland if he would do the same thing over again if he knew the consequences. \n\"Absolutely,\" the runner replied. \nHinson, who said he was greatly upset by Hougland's disqualification, was elated when he found out Davis County will run at state. \nThe Mediapolis girls qualified for the state meet, and Hinson said he'll be in Fort Dodge to support that team, as well as rooting for Hougland. \n\"I definitely have the intentions of cheering him on, the entire race,\" Hinson said. 213 CONNECT 16 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1S0ZU52 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:31:05.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
