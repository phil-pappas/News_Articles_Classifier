There’s everything to play for.”\nThe meeting between the Canadian rivals was the most tense of the encounters on this side of North America on a night where eight of 10 eastern MLS teams played concurrent matches.\nColumbus Crew beat D.C. United 5-0 and will join New York Red Bulls on a bye into the conference semi. Fourth-place United will host the fifth-place New England Revolution, who defeated New York City FC 3-1, in the league’s other midweek knockout game.\nThe stakes were high for the Reds going into the final 90 minutes of the season.\nA win or tie would secure Toronto a coveted home playoff match and even a potential bye; a win for Montreal could mean a third-place finish and starting off the post-season at Stade Saputo.\nThe concern for Toronto, though, centred around the unknown.\nIt was the first match where the Reds faced Drogba, the Impact’s star summer signing . And Toronto did so without regular centre-back Damien Perquis, out with a hamstring injury.\nThroughout the week Reds coach Greg Vanney counselled his side to limit service to the striker; the visitors managed to do just that in the first half.\nBenoit Cheyrou controlled Toronto’s play from the centre of the pitch and captain Michael Bradley put in a dogged defensive shift to support his backline.\nThe Reds’ hard work was rewarded minutes before halftime when Sebastian Giovinco floated a ball from the left side toward Altidore’s head. The American striker made no mistake, knocking it past Impact goalkeeper Evan Bush.\nThe blue, black and white supporters went into the half like their No. 1 striker: quieted. But Drogba didn’t stay that way.\nMontreal returned to the pitch with a vengeance; Toronto did not.\n“We fell asleep for about 15 minutes in the beginning of the second half and it cost us big-time,” midfielder Jonathan Osorio said.\nThe Ivory Coast native tapped a shot past both Kantari and goalkeeper Chris Konopka in the 54th minute.\nOne minute later, Drogba did it again. A similar movement with a similar tap-in and the Impact was suddenly back in front, both on the scoreboard and in the standings.\nIt was a devastating collapse for Toronto, and the first time the team has lost this season after scoring first.\n“We’ve got to learn from it,” Osorio said. “We slowed the game down a little bit at that point. People have to calm their nerves a bit. I think we got a little bit nervous and a little bit rattled.”\nA shot off the crossbar by Bradley reinvigorated his side for the final 20 minutes, to no avail. But the story between these two sides isn’t finished yet.\n“At this point, it does us no good to worry about anything that’s gone on up until now because we all know how the playoffs in this league work,” Bradley said. “A new season starts right now. It’s about recovering and making sure that mentally and physically we’re at 100 per cent come Thursday.”\nToronto and the Impact will meet again in Montreal Thursday at 7 p.m.\nMore on thestar.com\nToronto FC’s Giovinco wins MLS’s Golden Boot award\nMiami Dolphins' offence decimates hapless Houston Texans", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://www.mlssoccer.com/standings"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:05:22.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
