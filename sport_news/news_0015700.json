Mark Wogenrich Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Five things we learned from Penn State's 38-10 loss at Ohio State. \nPenn State thought its 38-10 loss to Ohio State was closer than the score indicated. Perhaps, especially considering the Lions had a shot at a 10-0 lead early. \nWhat else did we learn from the game? Here's a look. \n1. Saquon Barkley is the offense. \nPenn State rushed for 195 yards against the Buckeyes: Barkley, the freshman from Whitehall, had 194 of them. That didn't include a 44-yard touchdown run that was called back because of offensive line holding. \nLineman Andrew Nelson described Barkley best. \n\"He’s a make-it-right guy,\" the tackle said. \"You may not get everything blocked exactly correctly, but he can make you right and make people miss. Definitely an explosive player.\" \n2. But what else is the offense? \nAside from Barkley and two individual-effort plays from receivers Chris Godwin and DaeSean Hamilton, the Lions managed little against Ohio State. \nGodwin is Penn State's sole threat in one-on-one coverage, which he proved on a juggling catch that he extended to 56 yards with a second-effort run. Penn State's lone touchdown was all Hamilton. \n\"We can build off the fact that we're starting to build an identity in the run game,\" Nelson said. \nSee No. 1 for that identity. \n3. Penn State can't contain J.T. Barrett. \nThis became evident last year, when the quarterback ran for two touchdowns in overtime and threw one in regulation.

Barrett ran for two touchdowns against Penn State. (Jamie Sabau / Getty Images) \nHe added four more Saturday (two rushing, two throwing) and changed the way Penn State played defense. \nEven Penn State coach James Franklin wondered why Ohio State stuck with Cardale Jones early. \n\"I thought we were playing pretty good when they had the traditional dropback quarterback,\" Franklin said. \"... Now Barrett comes in. ... The combination of [Ezekiel Elliott], the quarterback and Braxton Miller, those guys just played at a different speed. That definitely factored in, no doubt about it.\" \n4. Franklin's tired of his punting. \nThe coach brought this up himself, calling it a two-year trial. Punters Chris Gulla (who returned from injury) and Daniel Pasquariello averaged 35.9 yards per attempt, put one punt inside the 20-yard line (to Ohio State's four) and did not help Penn State flip field position. \nPenn State's 2016 recruiting class includes a scholarship punter: Blake Gillikin of Georgia. Until he arrives, Franklin might get creative. \n\"If we need to have open tryouts, we’re going to have to find a way to solve that problem,\" the coach said said. \n5. Franklin will 'play to win' \nHackenberg clearly was hurting in the second half, when he attempted four passes and was sacked three times.

(Jamie Sabau / Getty Images) \nYet he remained in the game down 28 points, as did Barkley and Akeel Lynch, who also returned from an injury this week. \nBoth running backs took big hits in the fourth quarter, which certainly could have happened earlier in the game. With 4 minutes left, though, maybe it's time to lessen their risk. \n\"We're going to play, no different than [Ohio State],\" Franklin said. \"Late in they game, they had [defensive end Joey] Bosa and their starting defense in there. We're still playing football to win.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:20:23.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
