It's a really different challenge and we have to test ourselves in a new environment. \n\"We haven't come into the league to try and target different fixtures. We're targeting every single weekend and everybody picked has to be capable of going right away.\" \nSale were thumped 41-3 by Saracens last weekend and head coach Steve Diamond is hoping for a backlash against Worcester. \n\"Last Saturday's result was a huge wake-up call and the lads have been working hard on the training ground to make sure we are ready for Worcester,\" Diamond said. \nIn Friday's second fixture, Jamie George-led Saracens travel to Gloucester with Owen Farrell named at inside centre.
