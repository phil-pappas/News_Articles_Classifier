The damage inludes a tear to the posterior cruciate ligament. \n\"Nick has A PCL tear along with 2 other ligaments,\" she wrote. \"It's not nearly as bad as it could've been. They'll wait for swelling to go down to decide when to have surgery.\" \nChubb was injured on his first carry of the game and had to be helped off the field. Bulldogs coach Mark Richt was initially optimistic that surgery might not be needed, but the subsequent exam dashed those hopes. \nChubb had rushed for at least 100 yards in 13 straight games. He entered Saturday's loss ranked third nationally with 801 yards on 91 carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:14:44.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
