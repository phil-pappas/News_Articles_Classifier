The OSU defense responded by forcing its third consecutive three-and-out, giving the offense a third shot to propel the Beavers to their first Pac-12 victory.\nAgain, OSU could not push the ball into the end zone. And again, OSU fell short in conference play, this time in a 17-13 down-to-the-wire contest Saturday night at Reser Stadium against an opponent that had not recorded a league victory in its previous 14 tries.\nInstead, it's now the Beavers sitting as the last winless team in Pac-12 play (0-4) and at 2-5 overall. OSU has also lost 16 of its last 18 conference games.\n\"You have to score,\" Andersen said. \"You have absolutely no chance in a great league (if you don't). The Pac-12 has proven itself very cleanly to be a league where you've got to be prepared to score points, and we are struggling mightily to score points ...\n\"We were in a position to win the game many times, and we didn't get it done.\"\nColorado (4-4, 1-3 Pac-12) squashed OSU's final chance when Chidobe Awuzie intercepted Nick Mitchell on fourth down at the Buffaloes' 38-yard line with 24 seconds left. But that takeaway followed an OSU three-and-out, which followed a 9-play drive that stalled when a deep fourth-down pass from Mitchell intended for Jordan Villamin sailed incomplete with less than five minutes to play.\n\"We had some great opportunities to execute there late in the game to get us the 'W,'\" Mitchell said. \"It comes down to me and my play. I gotta be better in those types of situations, make the throws that need to be made for us to win the game.\"\n Oregon State football: Gary Andersen after Beavers' 17-13 loss to Colorado Oregon State head coach Gary Andersen discusses the Beavers' fourth straight loss, the quarterback situation and the play of running back Ryan Nall.\nMitchell playing in crunch time was part of a tweaked offensive game plan for the Beavers. He and regular starter Seth Collins rotated throughout much of the game, even lining up on the field at the same time during a wild first possession where Collins took a handoff, Mitchell caught a Collins pass and Ryan Nall plowed the ball over the goal line for the Beavers' only touchdown of the night.\nAndersen said the two-quarterback system will remain in place for the immediate future, giving the Beavers an athletic option who can make plays out of the pocket in Collins (who rushed for 50 yards and went 4-of-7 passing for 77 yards) and a more accurate traditional passer in Mitchell (who went 9-of-24 for 122 yards, zero touchdowns and zero interceptions).\n\"The bottom line is our best opportunity to do some things on offense is to have both of those quarterbacks play,\" Andersen said. \" ... We'll consistently roll those kids through the game and get them in a position to help the offense move forward.\"\nAndersen again pointed to \"missed layups\" as a primary reason the Beavers wound up on the losing end. The coach particularly harped on key dropped passes by the wide receivers, which Andersen believed prevented Mitchell from having a \"pretty special night.\"\nYet even though the defense put together its best performance during Pac-12 play — holding the Buffaloes to 328 yards, forcing six punts and helping keep the score deadlocked at 10 entering the final period — that unit also fell victim to a crucial botched opportunity.\nOn the first play of the fourth quarter, an off-target pass under pressure by Colorado's Sefo Liufau bounced right off the hands of linebacker Jonathan Willis in Buffaloes territory. Colorado quickly regrouped and finished off an 85-yard go-ahead drive, with a Liufau 4-yard touchdown run giving the Buffaloes a 17-10 lead with less than 13 minutes remaining.\nThat possession turned out to be the game-winner for the Buffaloes. Though OSU immediately answered with a 9-play, 60-yard drive that ended with a Garrett Owens 34-yard field goal, the Beavers would not score again.\nComing from behind to win in the fourth quarter and closing out games are often characteristics of veteran teams. OSU, of course, certainly isn't that in Year 1 of Andersen's tenure. The fact that the Beavers' two offensive postgame media representatives were Mitchell, who made his collegiate debut Saturday night, and Nall, who saw his first significant action, provided the latest example.\nBut Andersen's silver lining following the game was he likes where this \"youth movement\" is going. And perhaps the biggest poster child was Nall, who constantly bounced off and bulldozed through tacklers while picking up a career-high 122 yards.\n\"Quite frankly, the young bucks are gonna keep on rolling, so the old guys better make sure they stay on the ship,\" Andersen said. \"Because it's gonna be a fun ship down the road. It's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\"Right now, it's not. It's tough. It is what it is. But we'll remember these days and we'll look back one day with a big smile on our face when we're winning games and taking care of business and say, 'Remember when?' ...\n\"We won't get demoralized. We'll keep on swinging. This young crew? They'll swing away.\"\nThe Beavers are going to need to \"swing away\" as they prepare to enter the toughest three-game stretch of the season, traveling to No. 3 Utah next week before hosting UCLA and then heading back to the road to take on No. 20 California.\nBut OSU's best chance on paper to secure a Pac-12 victory passed by on Saturday night because it could not capitalize down the stretch.\n\"You let one slip away like that,\" linebacker Caleb Saulo said, \"it's probably gonna make you stay awake overnight.\"\n-- Gina Mizell | @ginamizell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ginamizell"], "published": "2015-10-25T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:08:35.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
