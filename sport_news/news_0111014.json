But that’s been a secondary topic around here this week, coming in well behind the hype generated by the return of Darrelle Revis to New England. Revis and the Patriots spent one mutually beneficial season together, in 2014. The four-time, first-team All-Pro cornerback revived a career that had been marked by injury and ineffectiveness over the previous two years, in the process earning his first and the Patriots’ fourth Super Bowl championship. “Really good player, very smart, instinctive,” coach Bill Belichick said. “When you don’t coach a guy, you don’t just have that day-to-day relationship with him. You just see him the times you compete against him. “He was a pleasure to coach and really has a great understanding, instinctiveness to the game, studies his opponents well, always well-prepared, very professional. Obviously, he’s a great player.” Greatness comes at a price, and it was one the Patriots weren’t willing to meet. They declined to pick up a $20-million option on Revis, which had been universally expected since the day he signed. “The number was too high,” Revis said Wednesday from New York. Hours after becoming a free agent, Revis rejoined the Jets, the organization that gave up three draft picks to move up 11 spots and select him 14th overall in 2007. The price was steep: five years and $70 million with $39 million guaranteed. Tom Brady stressed he didn’t have any input into Revis’ departure, but made clear he wouldn’t have minded if the cover corner had extended his stay here. “They never really consult me on anything like that,” Brady said. “I obviously love keeping great players. That helps our team win, and unfortunately people have to move on at times and it didn’t work out. But he’s had an unbelievable career. Like I said, he’s supremely talented, one of the best corners to ever play the game. “Now we’ve got to go against him, so we’ve got to try to figure out ways to get our guys open. And hopefully we can go out there and compete hard and make some plays when we need to.” The 5-foot-11, 189-pound Revis has been making plays at a spectacular rate for the Jets, who are 4-1 and have already matched their win total from last season. He’s tied for fourth in the NFL in interceptions and tied for first in fumble recoveries with three of each. Revis has been reunited with cornerback Antonio Cromartie, who also rejoined the Jets in the offseason, to upgrade a defense that ranks first in the league in both fewest points (15.0) and fewest yards (269.2) allowed per game. The Jets are second against both the pass and the run. “I still think we’ve got a ways to go, but we’re getting better,” first-year coach Todd Bowles said. “They’re starting to learn each other and what each other can do. So, from that standpoint I think we’re getting better. “Revis and Cromartie, they’ve been around the league for a while and they play well together. They understand what it takes out there. They’re just professionals that do their job and I can really respect that about them and they fit in well.” Revis’ stay in New England was short, but his former teammates believe they reaped long-term benefits from observing the way he prepared (hard) and played (harder). That was for defense and offense alike. “Film study. Going out there, not panicking and having confidence,” said second-year pro Malcolm Butler, who replaced Revis as the Patriots’ No. 1 cornerback. “I mean, Reev made me a better player,” said receiver Julian Edelman, who figures to find himself in need of a way off Revis Island on Sunday. “He’s an elite corner. I’d say he’s one of the best in the league. Going against him definitely made me a better receiver last year. It was good to have him.” The Patriots, to a player, have spoken highly of Revis this week. However, it’s doubtful the Fickle Foxborough Faithful will be as supportive Sunday despite the integral role Revis played in delivering a Lombardi Trophy. As was the case with the Patriots failing to pick up his option, Revis won’t be surprised if he’s shouted down. “I don’t think I’ll be welcomed back with open arms, I’ll tell you that,” he said. “Their fans … they love the Patriots. I’m not in that colored jersey, so we’ll see how it goes.” First place in the division is on the line, but that story is secondary in many ways as Revis returns and the Border War resumes Sunday.
