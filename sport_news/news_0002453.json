Senior middle Olivia Magill, a key part of Hawaii’s 11-match winning streak, was named the conference’s Defensive Player of the Week after being in on 19 total blocks in the Friday’s sweep of CSUN and the five-set thriller over Long Beach State on Sunday. Magill tied her career-high with 11 total blocks against the 49ers, including a career-high three solo, moving her up to No. 5 among the national block leaders at 1.63 bps.\nWith 32 blocks in the two previous matches, the Rainbow Wahine remained No. 1 in blocking nationally at 3.40 bps. Hawaii also remained at No. 8 in the AVCA Coaches Top 25 with Ohio State (16-2) leapfrogging the Wahine, going from ninth to seventh helped by its victory over defending national champion Penn State (15-2).\nUSC (18-0) and Texas (15-1) stayed at 1-2. The Women of Troy had 63 first-place votes and the Longhorns the remaining vote.\nAs for the computer-generated RPII, Hawaii moved up eight places to 28th. USC stayed at No. 1 while UCLA (13-3), the only team to beat the Wahine this season, was at No. 6 in the RPI and No. 12 in the poll.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:34:34.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
