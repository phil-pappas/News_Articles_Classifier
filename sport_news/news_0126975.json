The offense picked up eight yards on first down when Seth Collins quickly fired to Victor Bolden , who scampered down the right sideline.\nTwo plays later on third-and-2, Washington State's three-man defensive line made a pre-snap shift. The quick movement drew left tackle Sean Harlow into a false start. Harlow, the hulking 6-foot-4, 300-pound junior, slapped his helmet with both hands in frustration as soon as the whistle blew.\n\"They moved just like our defense did,\" offensive coordinator Dave Baldwin said. \"And our defense does it to us all the time (in practice).\"\nIt was another example of execution in practice not translating to game day. The penalty turned a third-and-2 into a third-and-7. When Collins could not reach Bolden on the ensuing pass attempt, Oregon State was forced into another three-and-out – one of 23 on the season .\nThe miscue was by no means a turning point in a game that already felt like it had gotten away from the Beavers. But it was one of three false start penalties Saturday, administrative miscues that they avoided in Arizona when also using a silent count.\nInstead of building a drive, narrowing the deficit and keeping the defense off the field, the ball went back in the hands of red-hot Cougars quarterback Luke Falk and he promptly threw his fifth touchdown of the afternoon six plays later.\n\"We've got to play more disciplined,\" offensive line coach T.J. Woods said. \"I think the physicality, the effort, all of those things have been continually progressing. We've been doing a good job in that setting, but we can't shoot ourselves in the foot.\"\nSo far this year the Beavers have improved on their atrocious penalty total from 2014, when they were the sixth-most penalized team in the country. Their total penalty yardage has decreased from 79.8 yards per game to 62.3 yards per game.\nBut in Oregon State's most recent throttling at the hands of Washington State, poorly timed errors emerged.\nAnother false start came in the third quarter after the defense prevented a Washington State score for the first time. Oregon State marched down the field and reached Cougars territory for the third time, leading to a fourth-and-5 attempt from the 25-yard line.\nBut once again the defense shifted before the snap. This time it was left guard Drew Clarkson who moved and drew a false start flag. Collins gained only seven on his fourth-and-10 scramble and the Beavers turned the ball over on downs.\n\"We start to move the ball last week and we hurt ourselves with penalties,\" Baldwin said. \"It's a lack of concentration and we've got to work on it.\"\nThe administrative errors were not restricted to the offense.\nAn offside penalty on Lavonte Barnett turned Washington State's third and 15 attempt to a third-and-10 in the first quarter. The Cougars easily converted and went on to score a touchdown on their third consecutive drive to take a 21-3 lead.\nHolding penalties could prove just as damaging, such as when right guard Fred Lauina was flagged for a grabbing a defender's facemask during Oregon State's first extensive drive of the game. The Beavers mustered four first downs before the penalty put them at first-and-24 from the 39. If Garrett Owens had not connected on a career-long 50-yard field goal, the drive would have come up empty.\nBut these penalties did not rile up the coaching staff like the ones that occurred before the ball even reached the quarterback's hands.\n\"The administrative penalties are things that you can control as an offensive lineman,\" Woods said. \"Holds, those type of things, sometimes those are effort penalties. ... I'm not saying that those are okay either but those happen in the game of football. What can't happen are the administrative penalties.\"\n-- Danny Moran\ndmoran@oregonian.com\n@DannyJMoran", "external_links": ["http://www.osubeavers.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30800&SPID=127145&SPSID=750123&DB_OEM_ID=30800", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208954060&DB_OEM_ID=30800", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=750127&SPID=127145&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=30800&ATCLID=209824934&Q_SEASON=2015", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=750127&SPID=127145&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=30800&ATCLID=209804010&Q_SEASON=2015", "https://twitter.com/DannyJMoran", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=210056690&DB_OEM_ID=30800", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=750127&SPID=127145&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=30800&ATCLID=209820626&Q_SEASON=2015", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208690161&DB_OEM_ID=30800", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=207912662&DB_OEM_ID=30800", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209602556&DB_OEM_ID=30800", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208694960&DB_OEM_ID=30800", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208953660&DB_OEM_ID=30800"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:15:44.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
