Hertig out-kicked three OE varsity runners in the final 50 meters to add three decisive points to the Hawks’ team score.

The FSHS juniors went out at the same pace with OE senior Kayla Davis for the first mile and a half, but Venters pulled away after that. \n“My race plan has been the same since the third meet, just hanging with the front pack until about the halfway point and then pushing it,” Venters said. “Then just what Heff says, ‘Push it with your heart.’ Just run with your heart at that point.” \nAlthough Venters pulled away from Davis and Cordes in the middle stage of the race, Cordes said that being able to stay in the front three helped her feel strong throughout. \n“It was like a slower start, which was nice,” Cordes said, “and then I had more energy toward the end.” \nAfter the Hawks fell just short of beating the Firebirds in the girls race, OE’s boys squad showed its depth to the take the team title over FSHS. \nOlathe East senior Nick Skinner set the pace from wire to wire on his way to a winning time of 15:57.07. Free State senior Ethan Donley was the runner-up with a personal-record time of 16:05.49 and credited Skinner for bringing the best out of him. \n“He’s been running pretty fast this year, so I wanted to kind of stay with him and see what that would take me to,” Donley said. “I figured it would take me to a fast time, so it was great.” \nOE’s Ben Kahnk and Free State senior Tanner Hockenbury followed Donley in third and fourth, respectively, but the Hawks sealed their win by packing four runners within 18 seconds of each other from fifth through eighth place. \nFree State sophomores Avant Edwards and Jared Hicks were not far behind that Hawks pack at 17:02.85 and 17:18.64, respectively, which was an encouraging sign to Hockenbury. \n“It’s good for them. I think they need the competition, and it only shows them what’s out there,” Hockenbury, who clocked in at 16:33.83, said. “You can be a stud younger runner for your age, but then you get into high school, and you realize what competition there really is.” \nThe Firebirds will see the Hawks and a much deeper field Saturday for the Sunflower League meet at Rim Rock Farm. \nBaker men third \nPrior to the Firebirds running in the high school division of the Haskell Invite, several area collegiate runners from Kansas University (unattached), Baker and HINU ran in the men’s and women’s races. \nKU mid-distance runner Whitney Adams placed fourth in the women’s 5K with a time of 19:04.26. Fellow Jayhawk mid-distance specialist Anthonio Humphrey Jr. took 14th in the men’s 8K. KU did not have a team score in either race since all of its runners were competing unattached. \nThe Baker men placed third out of 10 teams, with sophomore Joe Linder leading the way with an 8,000-meter time of 27:19.80. Freshman Jenna Black clocked in with a 5,000-meter time of 20:45.08 to help Baker’s women’s squad take eighth out of the 12-team field. \nHaskell fielded three runners apiece in the men’s and women’s races. Cherica Eckiwaudah placed 69th in the women’s race with a time of 22:58.17. Derrick Sleeper paced the HINU men with a time of 31:54.20, good for 74th place. \nHaskell Invite \nSaturday at Haskell Indian Nations University \nHigh School Girls Varsity/JV team scores – Free State varsity 29, Olathe East varsity 32, Olathe East JV 92, Free State JV 105, Manhattan varsity 123, Manhattan JV 178. \nFree State results – 1.
