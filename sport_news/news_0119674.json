Babcock will not likely have centre Tyler Bozak or defenceman Jake Gardiner in the lineup, he’s leaning towards rookie centre Byron Froese in his first NHL game and has Jonathan Bernier starting, the more inconsistent of his two goalies. \nOn the plus side, the Leafs came as close to winning as any of the seven teams the Habs have mowed down so far, a 3-1 opening night, empty net goal loss. And the Habs are playing in Buffalo on Friday. \n“We’re excited that they play tonight and we get to watch them,” said Babcock, whose Leafs have lost both ends of back to backs against rested teams as part of their record of 1-3-2. “ We look forward to the opportunity.” \nThe Canadiens are threatening the league record the Leafs share for 10 straight wins to start the season. \n“They’re real fortunate in that they got off to a good start, their goalie (Carey Price) is playing well, they’ve had no injuries and played the same lineup every night,” Babcock said. “They’ve kind of hit their rhythm early so it’s going to be a good test for us. \n“It’s always fun going to Montreal, I love going to the city myself, it’s spectacular, so are their fans, their uniforms. They care about hockey there, no different than in Toronto.” \nBabcock should turn in his medical degree after a daily prognosis that Bozak’s lower-body injury was improving. By Friday, a week after Bozak was injured in the Leafs’ lone win at Columbus, there was still no sign of him on the ice. Gardiner, a late scratch Wednesday against the Sabres has already been ruled out. \nEnter Froese, a former Chicago Blackhawk fourth rounder from 2011, who bounced around the ECHL and AHL until striking it rich with the Marlies. Including his three goals in four games this season on the farm, the Winkler, Man. native has 49 points in 55 Marlie games. \n“I didn’t know who he was at camp, but he got better and grew on me every day,” said Babcock. “We’re looking to be more competitive in the centre hole. I don’t know (if he plays), but that’s the beauty of having another day to think about it.” \nOn Thursday, the Leafs sent Frankie Corrado to the Marlies. \n“I’ve been working hard throughout the whole process, waiting for my chance,” said Froese, who would likely play between P.A. Parenteau and Michael Grabner. \nHe put down his success in the AHL to “just getting to the net, a lot greasy goals that weren’t pretty. But also working hard in the defensive zone and making sure pucks get out.” \nThe choice of Bernier to start ahead of James Reimer (1-0-1) is not too surprising, given Babcock’s anxiousness to get his highest paid goalie some confidence. To have him sit and stew through a game in his hometown would not be condusive to that plan and Bernier did play well in a 2-1 shootout loss in Buffalo. Babcock knows all about Price, the Canadian Olympic team goalie. The only puck the Leafs put past him on Oct. 7 was off James van Riemsdyk’s skate. \nSaturday’s game will also be Parenteau’s first in Montreal since coming here as a UFA. \n“I’m really fired up,” said Parenteau, who has a goal and assist in six games. “I’m still fighting for some ice time, but that will come if I do little things right. \n“It was awesome to play at home, even if it was just for a year. It was tough with injuries, but amazing to put that jersey on in my home (province).” \nHe didn’t have much to add about solving Price than the rest of the league hasn’t tried. \n“As a team, we have to make life harder on him. It’s an old cliche, but I think it’s do-able. We get in front of him, we get in his crease, we can make things happen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:39:26.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
