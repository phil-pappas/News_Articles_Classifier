But right now, we need all the games we can get and the more we get that don’t count, the better it is for the coaches.” \nThat last comment drew laughs, because the Wolves, littered with high draft picks, along with a bunch of veteran teachers, are stuck in the ultra-competitive Western Conference, which means it should be a while before the team regularly wins even 40% of its contests. Raptors lose a close game to the Timberwolves in Ottawa. #RTZ Final Box: http://t.co/VslqAVNUIy pic.twitter.com/7Z6gNdXkqL — Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) October 15, 2015 \nCasey sees the value in the exhibition slog as well, but also says it has its challenges because there is a need to balance rest to make sure star players make it through the grind of the regular season and the playoffs beyond that, with the reality that fans pay hard-earned money to attend games, expecting to see those standouts on the court. \n“As a coach, you do need that time together, whether it’s four games, five games, six games,” Casey said. \n“It does get taxing (though), because you do feel an obligation to the fans, they do want to see the guys play together. You do feel that obligation that they bought tickets so they deserve to see guys play,” he said. \nThe Raptors play seven exhibition games this fall, down from as many as eight in previous years. \nThe team has gone 3-2 so far, with more telling contests on deck against East favourite Cleveland (Sunday at the ACC) and playoff nemesis Washington (next Friday night at the Bell Centre in Montreal) looming. \nCasey sat DeMar DeRozan earlier this week and Kyle Lowry and Luis Scola on Wednesday night in Ottawa, though he worked both hard at shootaround, which he said was better than giving them the entire day off. \nSCOLA SURPRISED \nScola has been around the NBA for years now and is the team’s elder statesman (he is nearly six years older than fellow veterans Lowry and DeMarre Carroll), so one would expect that he already would know quite a bit about his new teammates, but it is different when you see players up close every day. \nYou get a better sense of their talents, what makes them solid players when you practice with and against them regularly instead of seeing them a few times a season. \nScola played with Lowry in Houston, but says he is better now, compared to back then. \n“Obviously Kyle takes it to another level from when he was playing with me,” Scola said recently, before adding that DeRozan has shown him the most. \n“DeRozan is obviously an all-star type of player and I have a chance to see with him and I have a chance to see why now a little bit more in detail because I’m practising with him every day,” Scola said. \n“He’s got a really big feeling for how to get to the free-throw line and, in today’s NBA, that’s crucial. It’s very hard to be effective if you don’t get to the free-throw line. He does that very well. He does that in games, he does that in practice, against all kinds of defenders and it’s going to take him far.” \nWhile DeRozan has struggled with his shot early on (just 10-for-35 from the field, including 3-for-14 over his previous two games), he has made 20 trips to the line (five per game) so far and sunk 18 of them. \nDeRozan finished fifth in the NBA in attempts per game (7.2) last season. \nHUSTLING \nCarroll might be the next Raptor due for a rest, having played in all five games so far. \nHe was quiet against Minnesota in Ottawa, but his approach to the game has been infectious. \nMost memorably, Carroll jumped over nearly two rows of seats a few games ago in an effort to track down a loose ball. \n“I loved it,” Casey said. \n“He sets the tone, the way we play. His defensive aggressiveness is contagious. I see the other guys emulating him as far as their moves. Cracking down, initiating contact, all that stuff. I see them emulating him.” \nAROUND THE RIM \nJames Johnson has had to play different positions, including centre, in order for Casey to get a look at everyone on the roster. Does the versatile big man mind? Apparently not. Asked his thoughts on playing centre, Johnson joked, “my name is Paul and I can do it all,” cracking up the room. Casey praised Johnson after the second Wolves game for his ability to get to the rim on offence, but said Johnson and the rest of the Raptors need to get better defensively ... Casey on Bruno Caboclo now, compared to the raw, clueless rookie of a year ago: “He’s playing right now like he belongs, which is huge for him.” Sponsored Links Is the NBA pre-season too long?
