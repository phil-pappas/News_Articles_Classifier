Hingle-USA TODAY Sports) \nBATON ROUGE — LSU’s next great tailback is already here. \nDerrius Guice, who out-gained starting tailback Leonard Fournette in LSU’s win over South Carolina Saturday, was named the Southeastern Conference’s freshman of the week on Monday after gaining 161 yards on 16 carries for 10.1 yards a carry with a touchdown. It was the most yards by a true freshman in the SEC since LSU’s Justin Vincent gained 201 yards in a victory over Georgia in the SEC Championship Game. Fournette finished with 158 yards on 20 carries and an 87-yard touchdown. \n“He just don’t want to be tackled,” LSU middle linebacker Kendell Beckwith said of Guice, a 2015 signee out of Catholic High in Baton Rouge. “He keeps running. Even when you think you got him, you really got to wrap him up and make sure he’s on the ground. You think he’ll be falling, but he’ll still be up and still be just running.” \nBeckwith said Guice and Fournette are the two running backs he has found hardest to tackle in his career. \n“Leonard, that’s like me getting the ball and running fast,” said Beckwith, who is 6-foot-2 and 252 pounds to Fournette’s 6-1 and 230. “But he’s way faster than me. He’s so big.” \nIn addition to Guice, LSU junior center Ethan Pocic was named the SEC offensive lineman of the week as the Tigers gained 624 total yards, including 396 on the ground, against the Gamecocks. Pocic received a 95 percent grade and led LSU with 17 knock-down blocks while not allowing a sack. \nLSU has won seven of the SEC weekly honors in five weeks. Fournette has won the offensive player of the week three times. Pocic has won the lineman of the week twice. Right tackle Vadal Alexander won the lineman of the week in addition to Guice’s award. \nINJURY REPORT: LSU starting fullback John David Moore of Ruston is questionable for Saturday’s game between No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0 SEC) and No. 8 Florida (6-0, 4-0 SEC) with a thigh injury suffered in the South Carolina win. \n“I don’t know about J.D.,” Miles said. “We’ll know later in the week.” \nTrue freshman Bry’Kiethon Mouton of Acadiana High in Lafayette is expected to replace Moore in the starting lineup if Moore cannot play, and true freshman David Ducre may also play. \n“I think Mouton, with a real quality week of preparation, will do great,” Miles said. \nStarting tight end Dillon Gordon (Achilles) and starting free safety Jalen Mills (ankle) are practicing but are also questionable for the game, Miles said. \nTOP LINEBACKER COMMITS: Michael Divinity, the No. 11 outside linebacker in the nation according to Rivals.com and the No. 6 overall prospect in Louisiana, committed to LSU late Sunday night. Divinity (6-2, 213) is from John Ehret High in the New Orleans area and fills a need for the Tigers, who are thin at linebacker. \nDivinity will visit LSU this weekend for the Florida game. He previously visited Florida State, Oregon and Texas A&M last month. \nLSU-WESTERN KENTUCKY TV: The Tigers’ home game against Western Kentucky on Saturday, October 24 will kick off at 6 p.m. on ESPNU, the SEC announced Monday. \nLSU and Florida kick off at 6 p.m. Saturday on ESPN.
