Puskar / AP) Mark Wogenrich Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Penn State running back Saquon Barkley out for game against Indiana \nSTATE COLLEGE â€” Penn State running back Saquon Barkley will miss his second consecutive game because of an injury. \nThe freshman from Whitehall High is in street clothes for Penn State's homecoming game against Indiana. Barkley, the team's leading rusher, has not played since sustaining an ankle injury in the first half against San Diego State two weeks ago. \nOn his radio show Thursday, Penn State coach James Franklin said that Barkley had practiced all week but was not \"100 percent.\" The coach noted his concern about playing Barkley at less than full strength. \n\"If we don't play him this week, he's got a chance to be 100 percent next week [against Ohio State],\" Franklin said. \nIn other injury news, fellow running back Akeel Lynch is out as well. Right tackle Andrew Nelson returned after missing the past two games. Linebacker Brandon Bell and safety Marcus Allen, who have missed time because of injuries, also are in the starting lineup. \nCenter Wendy Laurent will replace Angelo Mangiro, who was injured last week against Army West Point. In addition, punter Chris Gulla is out after injuring himself making a tackle against Army. Daniel Pasquariello will punt. \nFor Indiana, quarterback Nate Sudfeld and running back Jordan Howard are in uniform and expected to play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:03:35.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
