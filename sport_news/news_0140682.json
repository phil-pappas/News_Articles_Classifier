Your counsel is advising you to not talk about this situation but you’re running that mouth all over the place about Magee stepping up and telling the truth, aka Bullying. chad October 23, 2015 at 4:10 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI hope the grammar police are on full alert that week CoolFrood October 23, 2015 at 4:12 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI am surprised UofL is allowing media access to its athletes at this time. I expect at least one eye-raising quote to accidentally result from these kids being interviewed by experience media professionals.

An attorney for UL/Pitino has told him not to talk so as not to incriminate himself. Barstool@Thoroughbred October 23, 2015 at 4:18 pm | Permalink | Reply \nMaybe he won’t be the coach next week? Bobbum man October 23, 2015 at 4:35 pm | Permalink | Reply \nYeah Definitely a coward move. Sure don’t want to make the likes of roy williams and none im any worse. The ACC is a mess right now, just need to wait for the hammer to drop on UNC and UL, UNC tbey will delay delay delay but it’s inevitable they’ll get something, it’s too massive of an issue L1CWHORE October 23, 2015 at 4:35 pm | Permalink | Reply \nTo Fake Lou’s point, those Louisville prostitutes can’t spell very well. \nThoroughbred or THOROBRED?

J-Dub421 October 23, 2015 at 4:52 pm | Permalink \nYeah, and how many times has Pitino said a player was suspended indefinitely, then played that player pretty much immediately?

I grew up in that area of Louisville and since it’s just down the road from Churchill I always thought that was where the jockeys ate dinner. \n3) I’m tired of this story…but it just won’t die. vince October 23, 2015 at 5:22 pm | Permalink | Reply \nGreat photoshop October 23, 2015 at 5:31 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI really want to know what Facebook Siva Sr. has to say about this. Tommycatsfan October 23, 2015 at 6:07 pm | Permalink | Reply \nLet me get this right. Pitino, who hasn’t shut up about this in his never ending attempt to dump this on someone other than himself, can’t go to ACC media day because he isn’t allowed to talk about subject he hasn’t stopped taking about? It would be cowardly and upsetting to fans for this tool to resign from his $50,000,000.00 gig and allow UL to move away from the embarrassment that is Pitino, but it’s cool to send three kids to media day to try to clean up his mess? Sounds about right. Only thing more incredible than this circus, which I love, laugh about and hope never ends, is UL fanbase tolerance of this! They really are DuhVille. P1cWhore!
