Despite the reversal, the Wildcats won the game 48-26. Tracy Barbutes / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. When the Thorsted Field gates opened at 4:30 p.m. Friday afternoon, the fans started rolling in. Fifteen minutes later, half the bleachers were full. By the time the junior varsity game started, they were packed. When Sonora and Summerville took the field for the main event, it was standing room only. And the two Tuolumne County teams put on an offensive show for the sold out crowd. The scoring went back and forth until finally Sonora pulled away in the second half to beat Summerville 48-26. “It was exciting. It was nice and noisy, I wouldn’t want anything less. It was awesome,” said Sonora fullback/defensive lineman Nate Gookin who provided many of the Wildcats’ offensive fireworks. “Everybody came out, there was a lot of emotion, it was a good battle.” Sonora took a 27-14 lead into halftime but Summerville responded by putting their quarterback deep to return kicks. “I haven’t returned a kick so far this year and when they put me back there I got the jitters just as I did at the beginning of the game,” said Travis Rodgers. “And as soon as I turned the corner and saw my blockers, I knew I had a chance and just tried to make a play.” Rodgers turned the corner dodged several Sonora tackle attempts and scampered 88 yards for a touchdown to put the Bears in striking distance at 27-20. “It’s a one score game right there,” said Bears head coach Sean Leveroos. “We returned the second half kickoff and kids feed off of execution. Energy goes up, they executed the kickoff and energy went high.” “I think that gave them life,” said Wildcat head coach Bryan Craig. “We had talked about getting a three and out and go down and score. But no, we give up a kickoff. And like we’ve done before, we like to make it interesting. But we were able to shut this one down a little sooner.” The Wildcats answered with their first drive, an 11-play, 86-yard march that was capped by Gookin dodging and weaving his way into the endzone for a 34-yard touchdown. But the Bears would cut into the Wildcat lead again. Rodgers lofted a pass down the right sideline and receiver Eli McLaurin laid out and was almost perpendicular to the ground as he made the catch for a 20-yard score. “Eli made some nice catches tonight,” Leveroos said. With it just a one-score game again, 34-26, the Wildcats answered, again. Sonora quarterback Sammy Page ripped off a long run and Gookin finished the drive with his third touchdown of the game, a 9-yard burst to give the Wildcats breathing room 41-26. Gookin was tough for the Bears to stop all game. The junior racked up 167 yards rushing on just 12 carries. “Open alley he’s getting it. He’s gonna make people miss,” Page said. “He’s a great running back. He’s a good guy with a lot of talent. He’s good to have on our side.” The Wildcats ran for a season high 454 yards. “Our guys up front worked a lot better than they have been,” Craig said. “They worked hard and that was an emphasis this week. I talked to them about let’s bring our game up a little bit and when we look at film I think we’ll see we brought it up. And Nate hit the right holes and ran outstanding tonight.” Sonora closed the scoring in spectacular style. Wyatt Faughnan took a pitch from Page and sprinted 94 yards down the sideline with 4 minutes left in the game. The Bears gathered in the far end zone for several minutes after the game and were visibly upset after breaking the huddle. “I didn’t grow up here, so it’s a rivalry to me but it’s not as close to me as it is with some of these other guys,” said Rodgers. “And honestly it wasn’t as emotional of a game we should have made it. I know I haven’t grown up with these boys but that’s the vibe I got. I made a lot of mental mistakes and some of the team. I don’t think we showed who we are tonight. I think we’re gonna come back and play harder next week.” Sonora (6-1 and 3-0 in the Mother Lode League) won its sixth straight game while the Bears (3-4, 1-2 MLL) suffered the fourth loss in the last five. The Sonoa-Summerville series is not a rivalry yet. “I heard it best from another coach, it’s not a rivalry until you beat them,” Leveroos said. The Wildcats have won all 13 meetings between the two teams dating back to 1964. “It’s a friendly rivalry with our staff and their staff,” Craig said. “We had a couple of laughs after the game when we talked and all these fans, I wish we could get more in here because I know there was more that wanted to be here. I loved it in here.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:04:01.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
