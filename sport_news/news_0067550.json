Photo: Getty Images\nThe 49ers fall to a one win, three loss record and some of their veterans, including wide-receivers Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith, were furious and showed frustration on the sideline after Kaepernick's poor throws.\nAdvertisement 49ers coach Jim Tomsula said the team was not fractured and backed Kaepernick as his quarterback.\n\"No, it's not fractured,\" Tomsula told reporters at a heated post-game press conference.\n\"I think there's a bit of frustration.\"\nFormer NRL star Hayne has had his share of highlights as a punt returner since joining the 49ers, but he was involved in one of the team's many lowlights when he fumbled a punt against the Packers.\nUnlike his fumble four weeks ago in the opening game of the season against the Minnesota Vikings, Hayne was not solely to blame.\nIn the second quarter Packers punter Tim Masthay booted a short punt to the left side of the field, Hayne raced from the 25 yard line to around the 40 yard line to catch it.\nIn a crowd of opponents and teammates, he signalled late for a fair catch.\nHis teammates should have backed off, but they didn't see him waving his hands.\nAs Hayne went to catch the ball teammate LJ McCray crashed back into the Australian, the live ball hit the ground and rolled toward the 49ers' end zone.\nIt was then a race between the 49ers and Packers special teams units, with 49er Dontae Johnson launching himself on the ball and diffusing play.\nHayne's statistics reflected the 49ers' forgettable day, with three punt returns averaging just four yards.\nAfter last week's 37-yard punt return it seemed the Packers were wary of Hayne, with Masthay aiming for the sidelines so the former Parramatta Eel would have less room to move.\nRodgers continued his MVP-like year, completing 22 of 32 passes for 224 yards and one touchdown.\nKaepernick completed 13 of 25 passes for 160 yards, one interception and was sacked six times.\n\"I won't even go into that conversation,\" Tomsula, when asked if Kaepernick would be replaced, said.\"It's not even on my mind.\"\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:49:42.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
