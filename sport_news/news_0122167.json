McKibben says Exxon Mobile organized and funded a campaign of disinformation and doubt: \"(I)t seems crucial simply to say, for the record, the truth: This company had the singular capacity to change the course of world history for the better and instead it changed that course for the infinitely worse. In its greed Exxon helped — more than any other institution — to kill our planet.\" On the same day, I read a newly released report stating that climate changes could well be quite abrupt and intense. Would not simple justice demand at the very least the public shaming and outing of every executive and scientist directly involved in this crime? As the world gathers in Paris for the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, it would seem most appropriate.\nJere Grimm\nNorthwest Portland", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/14/exxons-climate-lie-change-global-warming"], "published": "2015-10-23T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:21:49.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
