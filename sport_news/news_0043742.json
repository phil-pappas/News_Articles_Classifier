On Sunday, Rapoport reported Fells was placed in the intensive care unit Friday but then \"moved to a private room to have a nurse focus solely on his care.\" He added:\nFells has had five surgeries, according to a person with knowledge of his condition. More are coming, as doctors try to stave off further infection. As of Saturday night, they were fighting to save his foot, which is at risk given the nature of the infection. ...\nThe situation arose, the source said, when Fells suffered a toe injury, then an ankle injury. To treat it, Fells was given a cortisone shot. After a week of ankle and foot pain, Fells' wife took him to the emergency room on Oct. 2 with a 104-degree temperature. There, they found his ankle was infected with MRSA, a dangerous staph infection that is resistant to many antibiotics.\nWith doctors hoping to avoid amputating his foot, the more urgent fear is that the MRSA has gotten into the bone and that it could travel into his blood. That could have the gravest of consequences.\nKimberly Jones of NFL.com noted recent MRIs have been \"clean.\"\nCoughlin Comments on Fells' Recovery Monday, Oct. 12 Following the Giants' win in Week 5 against the San Francisco 49ers, Giants head coach Tom Coughlin announced at his press conference, \"Fells is making progress for the third day in a row. Two to three nights in a row of good sleep. We dedicated the game to Daniel Fells. On Skype in our team meeting today, we showed him the game ball.\"\nCoughlin originally expected Fells to be released from the hospital by Oct. 8, according to Raanan .\nFells Placed on Injured Reserve Wednesday, Oct. 7 The Giants announced they placed Fells on season-ending injured reserve and signed wide receiver Myles White from their practice squad.\nFells, 32, had six receptions for 60 yards this season.
