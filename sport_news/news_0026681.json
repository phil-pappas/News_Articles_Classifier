Dawkins passed away on Aug. 27 at the age of 58 of an apparent heart attack, and Malone died on Sept. 13 at the age of 60, and the cause of his death was listed as hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease. \n\"You look around and se what’s happening to athletes that’s 50-plus and really you would think they have access to doctors and all the best health care, but they don’t take advantage,’’ Cuban said before Friday’s Mavs-Atlanta hawks game. \"Like all of us, sometimes we just procrastinate until it’s too late. \n\"And so I want to at least get the ball rolling with some Mavs ex-players and check them and see what we find and see what we learn, and then we can discuss expanding the program from there.’’ \nClick here for the full story from the Star-Telegram .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:31:11.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
