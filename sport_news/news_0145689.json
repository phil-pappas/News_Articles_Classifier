Who knows what might materialise? \n\"We have got two very difficult games coming up. We are playing the world champions, players who are playing Champions League football on a regular basis, players who have won a World Cup, players who have got the experience of going away from home and dealing with any given situation, and they are improving. \n\"And we are playing Poland, who are very, very strong. We are playing Poland away from home, two difficult games. \n\"Does that mean that we just give up? Absolutely not. We are going to go and show a bit of fighting spirit and a bit of ability and a bit of self-belief - which is very, very important - a bit of self-belief to know that when you have the ball, as we will have the ball at certain stages, that we try to manoeuvre it because we will get a chance to play. \n\"The Germans are very, very good, but does that mean it's impossible? Absolutely not. We have a challenge on our hands and we have the desire to deal with that challenge.\" \nIreland will be without first-choice full-back Seamus Coleman because of a hamstring injury and suspended midfield duo Glenn Whelan and James McClean for a fixture which could bring back bad memories for some members of the squad. \nIn October 2012, the Germans trounced the Republic 6-1 in a World Cup qualifier in Dublin to push then manager Giovanni Trapattoni to the brink, although he ultimately survived a major crisis which nevertheless sowed the seeds of his departure. \nHowever, skipper Robbie Keane insists a black night for Irish football will not be on his mind this time around. \nKeane said: \"No, certainly not. We have got a different management staff, we have had new players come in. I'm certainly not one of those players who looks back. \n\"We have a squad of players here now that is quite capable of getting something against the Germans. They are still a fantastic team, but they certainly have a few flaws in the team. \n\"It's going to be a difficult game, but the players are certainly not thinking about what happened against Germany the last time, there's no question about that. \n\"We are fully-focussed on Thursday's game and nothing else.\" \nIt has been an eventful few days for 35-year-old Keane, who became a father for the second time on Monday evening and then dashed across the Atlantic to meet up with his international team-mates. \nAssistant manager Roy Keane appeared nonplussed when asked about the LA Galaxy frontman's availability as a result, suggesting to much hilarity that it would not be a problem as long as he was not breastfeeding. \nThe younger man's response was equally irreverent. \nIreland's record goalscorer said: \"He's used to it because he's got bigger t**s than me\", before adding: \"\"I'll be ready to go. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:55:29.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
