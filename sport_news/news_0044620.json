It would have been great for me personally to work under Sir Alex,\" the Welshman says.\nMoyes was sacked after less than a full season at Old Trafford, but Ferguson insists the club did not make a mistake by hiring him.\n\"We did the best under the circumstances we were in,\" Ferguson says, adding that it was nonsense to suggest that Moyes' appointment was his decision alone.\n\"When I announced my retirement, do you honestly believe that one man could decide the future of Manchester United?\" Ferguson said.\n\"That's absolute nonsense. There was a good process... Jose (Mourinho) was going back to Chelsea, Carlo Ancelotti was going to Real Madrid, Jurgen Klopp had signed a contract with (Borussia) Dortmund, Louis van Gaal was staying with Holland for the World Cup.\n\"The other thing was I took Pep Guardiola for dinner in New York in September and I had no idea I was ever going to retire and I said to him give me a call and tell me what you're going to do. No answer.\n\"I don't think we made a mistake at all... We picked the right man. Unfortunately it didn't work for David.\"\nMourinho says in the film that Ferguson knew he was going back to Chelsea.\n\"I wanted to come to Chelsea and we didn't bring that to the table because we were so open and he knows so much about myself,\" Mourinho said.\n\"He knew that for almost a season I want to leave Real Madrid and I want to come to Chelsea.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T12:07:56.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
