Navy's longtime defensive coordinator is on sabbatical this season while trying to recuperate from major neck surgery. \nThe 62-year-old college football coaching lifer said earlier this week doctors did not recommend another surgery. \n\"I'm still in recovery mode. Fortunately, my doctor has identified the problem and now we can attack it,\" Green said. \"I'm resting and doing all the right things recommended by the medical people.\" Read the story \nIn April, Green underwent double fusion surgery to repair ruptured disks in his neck. He spent three months recuperating and tried to resume coaching duties when training camp began in early August, but the daily grind that included spending two hours on the practice field was too much. \nAbout a week and a half into preseason, it was obvious to the other assistants that Green was in debilitating pain. On Aug. 13, head coach Ken Niumatalolo ordered Green to step away from on-field coaching duties in order to focus on his health. Dale Pehrson was named interim defensive coordinator and Green took on a consultant's role. The home of the Bills is a closely guarded secret (Tim Prudente) \nIn hindsight, Green admits the move was for the best as he was experiencing severe numbness on the right side. \"I had no feeling in my arm or hand. It was kind of scary and the pain was unbearable,\" he said. \nMultiple tests showed the fused disks had not completely healed and were also putting pressure on disks located below. Green is still experiencing some pain, but doctors are hoping to improve the situation by administering regular steroid injections. \n\"I'm not in as much pain as I had been; so I think things are headed in the right direction,\" said Green, who is slated to begin physical therapy next week. \"Hopefully, these injections will get the inflammation under control.\" \nGreen said he has been overwhelmed by the amount of support he's received since it was announced he would take a sabbatical. He's been inundated with cards, letters, phone calls and texts â€“ some from friends in the coaching business, but the large majority from Navy fans he doesn't know. \n\"It's been absolutely incredible to have so many people wishing me well and saying that they're praying for me and pulling for me,\" Green said. \"I've gotten cards from folks that say they were Class of '58 or Class of '72. I'm very, very appreciative of all the kind words and thoughts and cannot thank everyone enough. It really has kept my spirits up.\" \nAlso uplifting for Green was the recent birth of a grandchild. Todd and Lauren Green welcomed their first child three weeks ago, a boy named Thaddeus. Todd Green is now the video coordinator for Clemson football after serving in a similar capacity at Navy for six years. Because Navy had a bye week, Buddy and Sharon Green traveled to South Carolina to see their third grandchild. \nGreen's primary responsibility is to evaluate film of upcoming opponents and prepare scouting reports for the coaching staff. \n\"Coach Green is always around. It seems like he never leaves the office,\" Niumatalolo said. \"He's doing film breakdowns and giving reports to myself and Coach Pehrson and Coach (Ivin) Jasper. He's just a football junkie.\" \nPehrson, who has worked side-by-side with Green since 2002, said the two have regular discussions about game plans and personnel. \n\"I talk to Buddy every single day. He's supposed to be resting, but that's a hard thing for Buddy to do,\" Pehrson said with a chuckle. \"Buddy watches tape just like he always has and gives us write-ups. It's been helpful.\" \nGreen insists he's not working too hard and said staying involved has been uplifting. He praised the performance of Pehrson, whose unit ranks 30th nationally in scoring defense (20.2 points per game) and 41st in total defense (358.2 yards). \n\"Dale is doing a great job, as I knew he would. We're playing really well on defense this season,\" Green said. \nNiumatalolo declined to speculate on when Green might be able to resume coaching. \"He's still trying to get healthy. We'll worry about that later,\" he said. \nPehrson was asked if it would be difficult to relinquish defensive coordinator duties after capably handling the role \n\"I don't think so. Friendship comes before coaching. Whatever happens, happens,\" he said. \"We're all just trying to win games. It's more about the kids than my reputation. I'm fine with whatever way it goes.\" \nTULANE QB CLEARED: Tulane starting quarterback Tanner Lee passed the concussion protocol on Wednesday and was cleared by team doctors to play on Saturday in Annapolis. \nCoach Curtis Johnson is hopeful the return of Lee, who sat out last weekend's loss to Houston, will boost an offense that has totaled just 34 points in the team's four losses. \n\"Tanner looked good today,\" Johnson said. \"The offense never looks good (without Lee in practice), but when he's in there, it looks good no matter what. All of a sudden you see a throw where he hits a guy in a tight spot, and it gives everyone confidence.\" \nTULANE @ NAVY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:05:12.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
