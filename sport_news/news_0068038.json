The Gators exacted revenge Saturday night at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. \nThe No. 3 Rebels lost, 38-10, to the No. 25 Gators in front of 90,585 fans, ending their chances of a perfect season and jeopardizing their hopes of qualifying for the College Football Playoff. \n“They beat us in about every facet of the game that you can imagine,” Rebels head coach Hugh Freeze said. “We didn’t play with the intensity that you have to in this environment early on to be able to compete. We didn’t take care of the football. \n“I think it was a solid game plan, but we certainly didn’t execute it, which means we didn’t do a good enough job preparing our kids to play in this kind of environment.” \nGators quarterback Will Grier — who reportedly, along with several of his teammates, had been battling the flu this week — completed 24 of 29 passes for 271 yards and four touchdowns. He’s the first Gator to throw for four touchdowns in a half since Chris Leak on Sept. 24, 2005. \n“He was really moving in the pocket, giving himself time,” Rebels safety Mike Hilton said. “His receivers were making plays when the ball was in the air and creating separation from us DBs. They really had a chance to make plays and go up and attack the football.” \nThe Rebels (4-1, 2-1 SEC) can blame their loss on a poor first half. They trailed, 25-0, going into halftime, though they entered allowing just 19.2 points per game, No. 34 nationally. \nQuarterback Chad Kelly was one of the few bright spots for the Rebels. He completed 26 of 40 passes for 259 yards and had one touchdown against one interception. He also rushed 15 times for 40 yards but was sacked four times. \nThe Gators (5-0, 3-0 SEC) opened the scoring with a 36-yard touchdown pass from Grier to wide receiver Demarcus Robinson less than 6 minutes into the game. It was the first opening-quarter touchdown the Rebels have allowed this season. \nThe Rebels’ defense soon added a second to that mark. \nFollowing a fumble by Rebels running back Jaylen Walton, Grier completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jake McGee with 6:48 remaining in the first quarter. The score gave the Gators, who missed their extra point attempt, a 13-0 lead going into the second quarter. \nThe Rebels entered the game outscoring opponents 65-3 in the first quarter, the lone points a field goal Sept. 26 by Vanderbilt. They haven’t been held scoreless in the first quarter or trailed entering the second quarter over their first four games this season. \nThe Gators added two receiving touchdowns in the second quarter, but their 2-point conversion attempts failed both times, giving them their 25-0 lead at halftime. \nRebels kicker Gary Wunderlich had an opportunity to give the Rebels their first points in the second quarter but missed a 29-yard field goal wide right. It was his second miss in eight attempts this season, the first one that hadn’t been blocked. \nWunderlich gave the Rebels their first points on a 22-yard field goal with 5:25 remaining in the third quarter, trimming the deficit to 25-3. The score capped a 19-play, 70-yard drive that started when the Rebels received the ball exiting halftime. \nThey faced a first-and-goal from Florida’s 1-yard line but couldn’t score following rush attempts by Walton (no gain) and two from Jordan Wilkins (losses of 2 yards apiece). The stalled drive continued their goal-line trouble from their game against Vanderbilt. \n“I’ve coached long enough to know you have nights like this,” Freeze said. “It’s not fun. But you’ve got to take the criticism that comes with it and get your team better. We’re still right in the thick of the West race, and we’re going to go play and get better.” \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com. Follow @DanielPaulling on Twitter.
