The real measure of a team, a coach, a player, doesn't come when things are going well in sports. Almost nobody goes undefeated. Success is more fleeting than it looks.\nIt's why coaches and players in sports always talk about how their teams respond to adversity, when the going really gets tough. In the NFL especially, the difference between a playoff team and a losing team is often the ability to snap a losing streak before it becomes a long one.\nIt's why the Giants can't let their debacle in Philadelphia turn into a month-long spiral. Unfortunately for them, months-long spirals have become too common, and they've proven to be miserable at responding to adversity in their recent past.\nFor proof, all they have to do is look one year in their rearview mirror, to see how a loss in Philly when they were sitting at 3-2 in mid-October became a landslide that didn't stop until it was December and their season was over at 3-9.\n\"That was last year,\" Tom Coughlin said defiantly. \"This is a new year. What am I worried about? I'm worried about getting our team ready for the Dallas Cowboys. Forget about last year. Last year was last year.\"\nUnfortunately for them, last year was also the year before, and really part of a decade-long trend that shouldn't happen to Hall of Fame caliber coaches and truly elite quarterbacks. Eli Manning has endured three six-game or longer losing streaks in his career - more than contemporaries like Philip Rivers (one) and Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger (none).\nIn fact, Manning has a paltry 37-36 record in games after losses (Coughlin, counting a few games without Manning back in 2004, is 39-38). That means 36 times in his 12-year career a loss either turned into or extended a losing streak. Eighteen times he's had losing streaks of at least two games. Six times the streak has hit four games or more.\nAnd that's not common among quarterbacks he believes are on his level. His brother, Peyton, has had just two losing streaks of four or more games in his career and none since 2001. Brady's only four-game losing streak came in 2002. And neither of them have lost even two in a row since 2012. Drew Brees has had only two streaks of four or more since a miserable 2003 season in San Diego. Rivers and Roethlisberger each had only two losing streaks that ever hit four.\nThose are Manning's contemporaries when he says he's \"elite\". Maybe they all played on better teams, or maybe they just made their teams better. Either way, the best quarterbacks need to find a way to act like an ace pitcher in baseball, to stop streaks before they get out of hand. And that goes for coaches, too. Coughlin should have been good enough to find a way to squeak out just one lousy win in this parity-driven league during both of the painful losing streaks that destroyed the last two years.\nDespite his inability to do that, Coughlin got a stay of execution from his bosses after last season. Manning just got a four-year, $84 million contract extension, too.\nIt is absolutely not too much of a burden to put on either of them to ask that this time they stop the bleeding that started in Philly before this season is lost, too.\nCoughlin, when asked about preventing another disaster, said \"All you can do is go right back to it.\" He even said that \"We really have been a group that, as a team, when adversity has struck, we've battled our way through it.\" And that would be true, if he had only added \"this year\" and \"so far\".\nThis team could have folded at 0-2, with a ton of key players standing on their sidelines. Instead, they battled all the way back to first place in the NFC East with three straight wins. Of course, last year's team battled back from an 0-2 start, too, to win three straight games to get back in contention.\nThen adversity struck again, and suddenly their battle was lost.\n\"The games where things don't go our way, we've got to handle them better,\" Coughlin said. \"You've got handle those situations better.\"\nAnd it has to start now, this Sunday against a Dallas Cowboys team still missing it's quarterback (Tony Romo) and best receiver (Dez Bryant). A Giants team with Coughlin at the helm and Manning at quarterback has no excuse not to beat then, even without Cruz and Jason Pierre-Paul the other players on their long list of injured bodies.\nThey need to show some toughness in the face of adversity, something they really haven't shown much of the last two-plus seasons.\n\"(A losing streak) is the last thing on our mind,\" Manning said. \"We're not thinking about that. We've lost games this season. We've bounced back. So we've just got to bounce back.\"\nYes they do. And it's the responsibility of Coughlin and Manning to make sure they do, to find a way to shut the streak down, no matter how dire the circumstances.\nWhat happens next is going to show what type of coach and player they really are.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:10:07.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
