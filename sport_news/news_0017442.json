He wound up playing only 13 snaps. \nThere are six players listed as probable for Sunday's game, and all six were full participants on Friday (injury listed in parentheses): starting cornerback Adam Jones (groin); wide receiver Brandon Tate (illness); wide receiver Marvin Jones (foot); cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick (hip); offensive tackle Andre Smith (elbow) and guard Kevin Zeitler (elbow). \nCheck back for the Bills official injury report when it becomes available. \nPhoto: Tony Tribble for Local.12 \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
