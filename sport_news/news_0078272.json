Sue Aquilina (Courtesy Photo) \n\"It's a very important win because I don't remember the last time we were able to beat Northwestern,\" Aquilina said. \"This is like an icon in girls soccer. Anyone that competes strongly against Northwestern, any coach is going to be proud of that. So I'm very proud of the girls today.\" \nFor Notre Dame goalkeeper M'Kenna Murphy and the other 10 seniors on the team, the victory over the Tigers was a special one. \n\"Since I've been here, we've never beat Northwestern,\" Murphy said. \"So this is very big for our seniors.\" \nShe made eight saves, including a few leaping ones, to make sure Notre Dame would finally get the win over the perennial power. \n\"We all came in very pumped, very hyped, knowing that we had to play our best in this game and we all left it all out there. And that is why as a team, we got this win,\" Murphy said. \n\"I expected a very difficult game. I think we all did, which is why we all worked very hard in practice and it showed out here today,\" Murphy added. \"We all worked well together and we all played our very best. We deserved this win.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:38:05.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
