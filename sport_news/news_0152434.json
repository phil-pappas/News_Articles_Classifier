I'm sure that had something to do with it. Things like that can contribute to that but I'm never going to tell anybody I am tired,\" he said. \"That's my job to be out here as long as I'm supposed to be out here.\n\"Two days from now I will be over this outing and over this month and looking for a fresh start next year. Take what you can from the season what you learned from each game, each outing. I'm always going to have confidence in myself.\"\nSolarte homered to right off Jungmann in the third, his 14th. Cory Spangenberg was aboard on a leadoff walk.\n\"I don't think he finished the way he wanted to,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. \"But the season as a whole, it was a great first year in the big leagues and something we can build on for sure. I don't think he pitched particularly well in September. He lost the strike zone and didn't get easy outs. Those early count outs that help him.\"\nIan Kennedy struck out 11 in what was likely his final start with San Diego.\nThe Padres underachieved this year, extending their postseason drought to nine seasons despite a roster overhaul that included adding stars such as Matt Kemp, Justin Upton, Wil Myers, Derek Norris and James Shields. San Diego will finish with a losing record for the fifth straight season.\nKennedy (9-15) is eligible to become a free agent. He was stellar, allowing only one run and five hits in six innings, with no walks. His only mistake was allowing a leadoff homer in the sixth to pinch-hitter Shane Peterson.\nCraig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 39th save.\nMyers left the game with a sore left wrist. Before the game, the Padres said Upton has a strained neck. Although Upton hasn't been ruled out for the season's final series at the Los Angeles Dodgers, there's no reason for him to play. Kemp won't play again due to a strained right middle finger. He was hurt Tuesday night.\nSpangenberg hit an RBI single in the fourth.\nMilwaukee's Michael Reed was thrown out by rookie right fielder Travis Jankowski trying to score from second on Hernan Perez's single to end the third.\nUP NEXT\nBrewers: RHP Ariel Pena (2-0, 3.91 ERA) is scheduled to start the opener of the final home series against the Chicago Cubs, who counter with RHP Jake Arrieta (21-6, 1.82).\nPadres: Casey Kelly (0-1, 9.00) is scheduled to make his second start of the season when San Diego opens its final three-game series against NL West champion Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium on Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:59:10.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
