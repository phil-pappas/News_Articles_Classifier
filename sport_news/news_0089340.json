(AFP) \nIndia will be battling for survival in the fourth one-day international against South Africa in Chennai in a must-win game on Thursday. Having conceded the Twenty20 series 2-0, Dhoni's India are trailing 2-1 in the five-match series. The MA Chidambaram Stadium pitch in Chepauk is expected to produce another run-feast but in all three previous matches the team chasing has choked. South Africa won a high-scoring thriller in Kanpur by five runs despite a brilliant 150 by Rohit Sharma. India inspired by Dhoni's blistering knock of 92 not out defended a small total of 247-9 for a series-levelling 22-run win at Indore. Proteas coasted to an 18-run win choking Dhoni and Kohli in the middle overs to restrict India to 252-6 after making 270-7 riding on Quinton de Kock's 103 and Morne Morkel four-wicket haul. The last time the iconic Chepauk hosted an ODI was way back in 2012 - a day match between India and Pakistan. Going into the Chennai fixture, India are grappling with a bit of negativity surrounding Amit Mishra's alleged assault on a female friend in Bangalore and Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar's return home due to security fears. Both teams have been rejigging their batting order with Kohli returning to his favourite No.3 slot at the expense of Rahane while Miller opened the batting for Proteas pushing down Amla. South Africa will miss in-form allrounder JP Duminy with Dean Elgar replacing him. The visitors are also sweating over the fitness of Morne Morkel - who put in a match-winning performances in the third ODI in Rajkot with figures of 4-39.\"I'm not confident I'll be ready for the next game. It's just a matter now of the next 24 hours,\" Morkel had said after the victory in the third ODI.
