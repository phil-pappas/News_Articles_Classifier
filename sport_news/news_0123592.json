He had another spot-on day, completing 17 of 24 for 321 yards with the long touchdown pass to Brandon Tate during a scramble. \nIt was another rough day all around for Kansas City (1-3). Alex Smith was sacked five times, the Chiefs settled for Cairo Santos' club-record seven field goals, and the defense couldn't keep up with another one of the NFL's top passers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:25:53.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
