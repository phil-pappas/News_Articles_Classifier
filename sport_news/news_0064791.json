Here are the top five:\n1. Snoop Dogg congratulates Dominique Hatfield\nProduct of south central. C house vet. üëäüèæüèà.

Michigan and Utah love each other\nThe Utes ‚Äô victory over the Michigan Wolverines in the Sept. 3 season opener didn‚Äôt seem like a huge deal at the time. Since then, however, Jim Harbaugh and company have been on a tear, winning five straight games. In that span, they‚Äôve only given up 14 points, and have shut out their last three opponents.\nAll of this means that the two teams ought to be rooting for one another. The better Michigan does, the stronger Utah‚Äôs win over it will look, while the better the Utes do, the Wolverines‚Äô loss to them won‚Äôt look as bad.\nThe two teams‚Äô newfound hopes for the other were displayed so tenderly on Twitter after Saturday‚Äôs Utah game:\nThe Bromance continues after #CALvsUTAH : pic.twitter.com/5dN8nNHsTZ\n‚Äî RedditCFB (@RedditCFB) October 11, 2015\n3. ‚ÄúHi, Jared. My name is Jared‚Äù goes viral\nMost watching the game would have seen Utes linebacker Jared Norris‚Äô emphatic stop of Goff when the Golden Bears' signal caller tried to run for a first down in the third quarter. Video of the play wound up going viral on social media:\nJared sit down what are you even thinking RT @linkcalhoun : @edsbs w . https://t.co/81Dv5KQdKM\n‚Äî JOEY FRESHWATER (@edsbs) October 11, 2015\nThis is never not funny. https://t.co/IINXJPtoxF\n‚Äî Brittany G (@Fibby1123) October 11, 2015\n4. Interception reaction\nAgain, if you were watching, it was hard to miss the fact that Goff and Utah quarterback Travis Wilson combined to throw seven interceptions, including four in the second quarter alone.\nAs you might expect, there were some pretty great reactions on Twitter. A sampling:\nA wicked game of hot potato has broken out in Salt Lake City.\n‚Äî Ashley Adamson (@AdamsonAshley) October 11, 2015\nNo one wants the ball in Cal-Utah.\n‚Äî Ted Miller (@TedMillerRK) October 11, 2015 This game brought to you by @Arbys .

Utah Jazz rookie Tibor Pleiss attends first football game\nPhotos surfaced on Twitter throughout the game showing that many Utah Jazz players were in attendance on Saturday night. One of them was rookie center Tibor Pleiss of Germany, who tweeted that it was his first time ever at an ‚ÄúAmerican football‚Äù game.\nAmazing experience !!
