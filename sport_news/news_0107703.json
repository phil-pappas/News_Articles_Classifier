(AP) - U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves, who serves in the federal court system's Southern District of Mississippi will take part next week in a forum in Oxford on the topic of race and moral leadership.\nThe University of Mississippi says in a news release that Eric Weber, an associate professor of public policy, asked Reeves to speak to a class. But Weber then decided to create a discussion forum for a larger campus audience.\nWeber decided to ask Reeves to speak after the judge presided over a high-profile trial in a racially motivated murder case in Jackson in 2011.\nThe forum is set for 4 p.m. Tuesday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
