Â» Nevada defensive end Ian Seau and kicker Brent Zuzo have been named the Mountain West defensive and special teams players of the week after the Wolf Pack came from behind to beat Hawaii 30-20. Seau sacked the quarterback four times, forced one fumble and recovered another as Nevada held the Warriors to just 34 yards rushing. The senior from Oceanside, California who is the nephew of the late NFL star Junior Seau became only the ninth player in league history to record four sacks in a game.\nZuzo made all three of his field goal attempts from 40, 29 and 30 yards. The junior from Canton, Michigan also recovered his own onside kick late in the second half as Nevada evened its record at 2-2 in the Mountain West, 4-4 overall.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:45:40.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
