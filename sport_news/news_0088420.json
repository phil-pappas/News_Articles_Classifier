Valencia's 2-run HR lifts Athletics over Mariners 4-2 1 / 6 Back to Gallery SEATTLE (AP) â€” Danny Valencia hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning, lifting the Oakland Athletics over the Seattle Mariners 4-2 Friday night. Josh Reddick opened the eighth with a single off reliever Danny Farquhar (1-8). Valencia, who had three hits, followed with his career-high 17th homer deep into the left-center field bleachers. Aaron Brooks (3-4), who gave up two runs and six hits over seven innings, earned the victory. Sean Doolittle finished for his fifth save in six opportunities. Hisashi Iwakuma pitched seven innings for the Mariners in a no-decision. He allowed one earned run and nine hits, striking out eight and walking none. Iwakuma, who ended the season at 9-5, is the fifth pitcher since 1961 to open his career with at least a .625 winning percentage in each of his first four seasons. He joins Dwight Gooden (1984-91), Roy Oswalt (2001-08), Tim Hudson (1999-04) and Teddy Higuera (1985-88). Brad Miller had three hits for the Mariners, including his 11th home run, a solo shot in the fifth. Robinson Cano , who said before the game that he would have sports hernia surgery later this month, singled in the Seattle fifth to extend his hitting streak to a season-high 14 games. He is hitting .357 during the streak. TRAINER'S ROOM A's: Oakland put 23 players on the disabled list this season, up from 18 last year.
