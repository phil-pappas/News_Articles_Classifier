The Serb improving to 26-and-oh in the Chinese capital, after beating the host country's Zhang Ze to make it to the Quarter-Finals. Novak Djokovic of Serbia celebrates his victory over Zhang Ze of China during the men's singles second round match at the China Open tennis tournament in Beijing, China, Oct. 8, 2015. Djokovic was qualified for the next round after beating Zhang 2-0. (Xinhua/Xing Guangli) \nDjokovic would start out strong, and takes the opening set 6-2. \nDjokovic keeps Zhang off-balance in the second, first the heavy forehand -- then the exquisite drop shot that the Chinese cannot get to. \nZhang would make the World Number One work in the fifth game of the frame, as the Chinese gets the overhead. \nThe result is never in doubt and Djokovic converts with a backhand volley. He advances to the Last Eight in 55 minutes, after a 6-2, 6-1 triumph. \nSo here is a look at the men's quarter-finals. Rafa Nadal just beat Jack Sock in three sets to advance. The Fognini-Cuevas and Ferrer-Lu matches are on court. With Djokovic and Isner headlining the evening sked. (SWIPE) \nSerbian into Quarter-Finals after 7-5, 4-6, 6-2 win \nAna Ivanovic facing Svetlana Kuznetsova, and pick things up in the seventh game of the first set, with Ivanovic at the top of your screen and down a break. The two wage in a pretty good baseline rally. Kuznetsova tries to change the pace, but the Serb is too quick, and retrieves that before smashing home a winner. \nThat seems to spur the former World Number One, who would win five of the next six games, and then takes the frame, getting a little lucky on set point, as a net cord throws her opponent's rhythm off. \nThe Russian would grab the second set to force a decider, but in the final frame, it would be all Ivanovic, and the heavy forehand winner gives her the match, as she advances to the quarter-finals. \nAs for the last eight on the women's side. Timea Bacsinszky edges Sara Errani in three sets to move on. Former champ Agnieszka Radwanska is currently playing Angelique Kerber, while Ana Ivanovic is up against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, and the evening match has Garbine Muguruza versus Bethanie Mattek-Sands.
