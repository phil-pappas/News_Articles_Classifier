Najera will make his FOX Sports Southwest debut on Wednesday, Oct. 28 at 8:30 p.m. CT prior to the Mavericks' season opener in Phoenix against the Suns. FOX Sports Southwest is scheduled to show 81 Mavericks regular-season games in 2015-16.\n\"We're excited to have Eduardo Najera on our team,\" Anastassiou said. \"He brings a wealth of experience as both a player and a coach and he's one of the all-time fan favorites. His insight will tremendously enhance our Mavericks coverage.\"\nA native of Meoqui, Chihuahua, Mexico, Najera became the first Mexican-born player to be drafted in NBA history and only the second Mexican-born NBA player when he was selected by Houston in the second round in 2000.\nThe 12-year NBA veteran spent the first four seasons of his playing career with the Mavericks from 2000-2004 and returned to the Mavericks in 2010 before finishing his career with Charlotte.\nNajera enjoyed a successful collegiate career at Oklahoma. He helped lead the Sooners to four consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1997-2000 and finished in the school's all-time top ten in nine statistical categories before joining the Mavericks.\nUpon his retirement as a player, Najera was named head coach of the Mavericks' NBA-D League affiliate Texas Legends in 2012, becoming the first Mexican-born head coach under the NBA umbrella. Prior to joining FOX Sports Southwest, Najera served as a scout with the Mavericks.\n\"I'm looking forward to my new role,\" Najera said. \"As a coach I had a great opportunity to see the game differently. Now I have a new opportunity as a television analyst and I'll continue doing the same thing. I'm going to call it the way I see it and hopefully the fans enjoy it and the Mavericks have a great season.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:02:36.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
