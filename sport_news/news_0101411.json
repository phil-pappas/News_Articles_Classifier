Bath, seeded No. 5 in the Section V, Class B1 quarterfinal, scored once with the wind at its back to tie the game 1-1 before halftime – then netted the game-winner with the wind in its face. “We could have folded – but the team responded,” Bath head coach Matt Hill said. “I was very pleased with the way we played. We were on the road, in bad weather, on strange turf – it was a good win.” The Mustangs, the tournament’s No. 4 team, opened the scoring in the game’s 36th minute when Scott Fingar got loose and made the Rams pay. “He dribbled the ball about 30 yards and then put one in the corner,” Hill said. Bath (11-4-2) had an answer right before halftime, though. Roughly 30 seconds before the intermission, Bath’s Casey Hyer connected on a corner kick that connected with Josh Carpenter’s head that connected with the back of the net. “We were very happy to be tied going into the half,” Hill said. “Going into the half down a goal isn’t a good thing – especially when we had the wind at our back in the first half.” With the wind in their faces, the Rams came out of the break strong and fast. Carpenter hit Camden Robbins with a cross that allowed Robbins to net the eventual game-winning goal just five minutes into the second period. Bath made it hold up to advance. Goalie Steven Binkowski recorded two saves in the win. Next up for Bath will be top-seeded Livonia. The game will be played Wednesday at a time and place to be determined. Boys Soccer Section IV, Class C quarterfinal No. 1 Notre Dame 8, No. 8 Spencer-Van Etten 0 SOUTHPORT | The Crusaders cruised to an 8-0 shutout victory in their sectional opener on Saturday. Nick Steed, Rocco Coulibaly and Mike Woglom each scored two times for Notre Dame – which upped its season record to 16-0. Notre Dame needed less than a minute to get on the scoreboard when Alec Cutler tallied a goal in just 40 seconds. “Sometimes scoring early hurts your rhythm,” Notre Dame head coach Brian Adams said. “We followed that up with a 20-minute spell of not playing well.” When the spell was broken – it didn’t take Notre Dame long to find its rhythm. Steed, Ryan Lanning, Coulibaly and Woglom all scored before halftime to give the Crusaders a 5-0 advantage at the break. Steed, Coulibaly and Woglom added second-half tallies, as well. Page 2 of 2 - In goal, Will Brennan needed just one save for the shutout as Notre Dame out-shot S-VE 21-1 on the day. Next up for Notre Dame will be a home match against Trumansburg on Wednesday at a time to be determined.
