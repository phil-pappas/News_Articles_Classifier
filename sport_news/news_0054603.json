(Photo: Ezra Shaw, Getty Images) \nCONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Allen Park â€” Lions coach Jim Caldwell said Friday that right guard Larry Warford is \"on the mend,\" and after missing practice Thursday, Warford rejoined the team on Friday.\nWarford, the Lions' top offensive lineman in 2013 and 2014, missed Week 1 and Week 4 due to a lingering high ankle sprain, and even though he returned to practice Friday, his status for Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals (4:05 p.m., FOX) is officially questionable, the same as it was last week when he didn't play.\n\"We just kind of lean on the doctors' recommendations, and we have him sort of following their direction,\" Caldwell said Warford's practice schedule. \"And he's been a little bit in and out. Some days he's been working, some days he hasn't been able to, but I think he's on the mend right now.\"\nStrong safety James Ihedigbo (quad) is also questionable Sunday after being limited all three days this week. If he can't play, Isa Abdul-Quddus would likely replace him.\nTight end Brandon Pettigrew (hamstring) will likely make his return Sunday after missing the last three games. He's listed as probable and should play a significant role with Eric Ebron (knee) out.\nLike Warford, linebacker Travis Lewis (ankle) made his return to practice Friday, and despite missing practice Wednesday and Thursday, he's probable to play. In the first half of Week 4, Lewis had four tackles, two for loss and a sack playing on the strong side.\nDefensive tackle Haloti Ngata (calf), running back Joique Bell (ankle) and Ebron missed every practice this week, and all three players are already ruled out. Ebron, though, was running behind the end zone of the team's indoor facility during the inside practice, which is a good sign that he's recovering.\nWith Ngata out and Tyrunn Walker (broken leg) on injured reserve, Caraun Reid and rookie Gabe Wright will likely start at defensive tackle Sunday.\nThe Lions also added cornerback Darius Slay (quad) to the injury report as he was limited Friday, but he's probable for the game.\nLinebacker DeAndre Levy (hip), defensive end Ezekiel Ansah (shoulder), punter Sam Martin (left knee), cornerback Rashean Mathis (calf), wide receiver Lance Moore (ankle) and offensive tackle Corey Robinson (ankle) are also probable.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:18:17.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
