I traveled for a year and had an idea for a coffee shop. Lately, I've been thinking I would like to make that happen.\"\nWith a college degree in finance and a job with a financial advisory group in Portland, 24-year-old Matt Brueggen said he too is interested in getting a start in the industry, though \"probably behind the scenes.\"\nSiblings Matt and Bethany Brueggen attended Coffee Fest 2015 in Portland hoping to get some pointers on the challenges of opening a specialty coffee shop. George Rede/Staff For first-time attendees like the Brueggens, there might not have been a better place for the two to hang out and learn more. Coffee Fest has grown steadily from its Seattle roots in 1992 to multiple trade shows each year in the United States, bringing together everyone from baristas and cafe owners to coffee brokers and suppliers.\nThe Portland event was the last of three regional gatherings in 2015 and the 75 th trade show overall. Since Coffee Fest began, organizers say, more than 300,000 coffee and tea professionals have attended. About 3,500 people registered for this weekend's show, a 14 percent bump from a year ago.\nMore than 240 exhibitors displayed their wares in a giant exhibit hall, touting the latest in equipment, supplies, snacks and marketing materials. A $40 weekend pass came with the opportunity to attend free classes, but attendees also could pay more for workshops â€“ all of the educational programming aimed at helping people start or improve their businesses.\nTop Finishers In Latte Art Competition Steven Lim, of Charlotte, N.C. won first place while Portlander Bethany Hargrove came in second in the Coffee Fest Latte Art World Championship Open competition at the Oregon Convention Center on Oct. 25, 2015 in Portland.\nThere was a fun element, as well, with on-site competitions for best coffeehouse, best espresso and best latte art. Bethany Hargrove, a 23-year-old Portland barista, earned a $1,000 prize in the latte art championship, finishing second among 64 competitors from as far away as China, Japan and Thailand.\nDuring the final rounds, Meredith Tribble of Powell, Wyoming, joined about 100 attendees on the periphery of the latte art contest, enjoying a homecoming of sorts.\nTribble, 27, left Wyoming after high school to attend George Fox University in Newberg. She graduated in business, worked for a coffee shop for a time, then moved back home to open her coffeehouse, dubbed Uncommon Grounds.\nNow in her fifth year, she employs six people at her business about an hour east of Yellowstone National Park and regularly attends Coffee Fest to learn about industry trends and just to recharge.\n\"There are not a lot of coffee shops in Wyoming that are invested in their coffee,\" Tribble said. \"It's so exciting to be here because people are so passionate. I love it.\"\nTribble brought two employees with her to compete in the six-team best coffeehouse competition, but also attended several classes with a focus on branding.\n\"A lot of them are basically life lessons and who you are as a business,\" said Tribble, whose wavy red hair, denim jeans and cowboy boots stood out in a sea of young dudes in beards, sweatshirts and backward baseball caps. \"It reminds me why I'm in business and what I stand for.\"\nMeredith Tribble's business degree from George Fox University proved useful when she returned home to Wyoming and opened her own coffee shop. George Rede/Staff On her left wrist she used a pen to ink a lesson she'd picked up from a workshop leader: \"Customer service is bringing the good out of others.\"\nInside the exhibit hall, Wesley Farnell of Calgary, Alberta, chatted with fellow Canadians who stopped by his booth to pore over an assortment of high-end ceramic cups, saucers and dishes and a stainless steel hand grinder suitable for travelers who want to pack and grind their own beans.\nFarnell started his product distribution company, Eight Ounce Coffee Supply , three years ago. With contacts made at three previous Coffee Fest events, he said he has quickly expanded his sales to 30 countries, with 1,200 customers in Canada and several hundred more in the U.S.\n\"Portland definitely has a deep coffee culture,\" Farnell said. \"People are very engaged when it comes to specialty coffee. It's refreshing to come to a show and engage with people rather than people (at other shows) who are coming up to get free (stuff).\"\nA few aisles away, Peggy Thompson-Hudon marveled at the growth of the specialty coffee industry and her own company, Hood River Coffee Roasters , since starting the business with her husband 25 years ago.\nThe couple began roasting small batches in their own home and mostly serviced local businesses. Today their company has customers up and down the West Coast and buys beans from brokers who provide single-origin coffees from 14 countries.\n\"Every time I come to the show, I get new accounts,\" Thompson-Hudon said with a smile. \"We have about 130 customers and sell about 4,000 pounds a month.\"\n-- George Rede\ngrede@oregonian.com\n503-294-4004\n@georgerede", "external_links": ["http://hoodrivercoffeeroasters.com/", "https://www.coffeefest.com/", "https://www.eightouncecoffee.ca/", "http://www.caffeinecrawl.com/portland.html", "https://twitter.com/@georgerede"], "published": "2015-10-26T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:43:36.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
