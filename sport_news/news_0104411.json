Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll works the sideline in the... One day after the Seahawks' latest fourth-quarter collapse came news that some people connected to the University of Southern California football program may be looking to court Seattle head coach Pete Carroll for their head coaching vacancy.\nAccording to Dan Patrick, the former \"SportsCenter\" anchor and current host of NBC's \"Football Night in America,\" two sources \"behind the scenes\" at USC have Carroll on their short list of potential replacements for Steve Sarkisian, who was fired by athletic director Pat Haden after he reportedly showed up intoxicated for the Trojans' practice Oct. 11.\nCarroll, of course, coached at USC from 2000 to 2009, racking up an 83-18 record with seven conference titles (one of which was forfeited  due to NCAA sanctions) and national championships in 2003 and 2004.\nAccording to Patrick, some boosters want to bring Carroll back to Los Angeles, and there's a feeling that there might be interest on Carroll's end as well.\n\"Pete Carroll is on that short list right now,\" Patrick said on his nationally syndicated radio show Monday morning. \"Not that Pete would leave Seattle. The alumni are all-in on trying to get Pete back.\n\"The people who help make decisions there, they think Pete Carroll is in play,\" he continued. \"What I was told, and this is before the loss (on Sunday): If it goes south in Seattle, they think that there's a chance that Pete would listen to go back to USC.\"\nPatrick's report brings to mind a similar report by Fox Sports' Bruce Feldman , who wrote a week ago that even though Carroll left with the specter of NCAA sanctions looming over the Trojans program, there are many at USC who don't hold Carroll responsible and would welcome his return.\n\"Yes, he led the program when it got in trouble with the NCAA, but many Trojans don't blame him for the sanctions,\" Feldman wrote. \"They saw it as an NCAA witch hunt.\"\nPatrick also named Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh and Texas A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin as names on USC's wish list.\nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Seahawks news .
