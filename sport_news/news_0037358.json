That's our identity. We're going to find ways the best we can to put our guys in the best possible position to succeed, and with that comes a variety of formations.\"\nIt's a pro style for coaching staffs to adjust week-to-week, and that's the impact of having an offensive staff who all have coached in the NFL as recently as two years ago.\nFisch said it's simply what these coaches are used to so. They worked in five different places last season — four on NFL teams — and brought their ideas together.\n\"These guys just know how to win,\" tight end Jake Butt said. \"They've won just about everywhere they've been. Offensively we've got a run-game coordinator, a pass-game coordinator and coach (Jim) Harbaugh who oversees it all. That's just such an advantage for us. Whatever we need to do on first down, second down, third down, we've got guys that are specializing in those areas. They've game-planned against NFL teams, so NFL teams are going to be really good at disguising what they're doing. When you go through something as hard as that, it probably makes it a little easier to communicate to us what we need to get done.\"\nThe only issue is the large playbook thrown at the offensive players.\n\"That makes it great,\" Fisch said. \"It challenges your guys to go home at night and make sure football's always on their mind. It gives the quarterback instant credibility when they go in the huddle and spit out a nice long one. ... On the same token, football never leaves their mind when they feel like they've never arrived. That's something important that our guys need to understand. It just can't be a 20-hour week with us. When they get home, they've got to look at it and they've got to prepare.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nU-M's Jim Harbaugh's the alpha dog, ESPN analyst says\n■ Third-down D: Michigan leads the nation in third-down defense, allowing only 18.8% of conversions. It's one of the defense's biggest pressure points, maybe only behind turnovers.\n\"Third down is a huge deal for us, it impacts so many parts of the game,\" defensive line coach Greg Mattison said. \"When they're not on the field, they have a hard time trying to score. More than that, it all goes back to effort. We talk about effort all the time. When you're three-and-out, you've got to a lot more time to be on the sideline and make the adjustments that you have to not make a mistake or to correct something. The biggest thing is you can play with more effort, you're not drained. You're able to get your three, make corrections and get back out there and say let's go as hard as we can. So, third downs are huge for us. (Defensive coordinator) D.J. (Durkin's) done a great job giving us a great game plan to be able to do third downs and be successful on third downs.\"\nThe Spartans rank eighth nationally and first in the Big Ten converting 50% of their third-down opportunities.\n\"Michigan State's been pretty good on third down,\" Mattison said. \"That's going to be a big key for us.\"\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
