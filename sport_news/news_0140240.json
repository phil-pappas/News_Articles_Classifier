Amelia Westley has dominated every competition winning them all. \nNew to diving this year, Ben Ferree and Nathan Fitzpatrick have also finished in the top three at every meet. The boys have learned their nine dives in seven short weeks of practice, something that is hard to do. \nThe eighth-grade team of Zoe Hester, Monica Luttrell (who attends Lyons Middle School but swims for Estes), Steele Wolf, John Ferree and Nathan Richardson have had a good season with many wins and top finishes. As leaders of the team they've set a great example of how to compete well against the odds. \nThe swimmers are looking to finishing well in their conference championship swim meet which will take place this Saturday, Oct. 3 at the Mountain View Aquatic Center in Loveland.
