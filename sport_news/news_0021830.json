However, Morris senior Nick McPherson shot 5-over-par 77 to tie for second behind the 75 of medalist Casey Domke of Marian Catholic and qualify for this weekend’s state meet. \n“I’ve played in a lot of wind, and you just have to trust it,” said McPherson, who will make his second straight trip to state. “I shot what I thought I would on the front [40] and turned it around on the back [37] and fought my way through.” \nMorris’ other counting scores were Jake Hulbert 86, Jared Lines 87 and Jack Galloway 88. \n“For our team to get out, we needed four really good scores,” McPherson said. “It wasn’t what we wanted it to be.” \n“We have four solid players, but it takes everyone to shoot their best and you don’t always get that,” Morris coach Matt Lafond said. \nClass 3A Alton Sectional: Minooka finished fourth with an 18-hole score of 331, 13 strokes away from state qualification.
