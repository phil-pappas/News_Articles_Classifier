If you look at his CV it's like a CV of five or six managers put together,\" Bilic said. \n\"To coach five or six national teams in six or seven different countries - he's a big name, a big manager. \n\"He has been in many situations in life and he knows how to act in this situation. \n\"I have known Sunderland's situation in the last few years but I didn't go that deep into it - they are a big club but every year they are struggling. \n\"And you can't blame just the managers. Maybe once - but three, four, five - it's definitely not the reason. \n\"I don't know what the reason is but it's definitely not the manager's fault.\" \nWest Ham are looking for their fourth consecutive away victory in the league after already beating Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City on the road this season. \nThe Hammers surprised all three with incisive counter-attacking football but Bilic is expecting a different challenge against the struggling Black Cats. \n\"The situation is created by the media that they need the win, it's not like if they don't win they are down,\" Bilic said. \n\"Sometimes when you're under that kind of pressure it gives you something extra to make you better than you normally are. \n\"If you're under pressure and you have a good start you become something you are not and the other way round. \n\"I don't expect them to be a stable team. They will either be great, or stiff.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:36:32.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
