It is an disposed testimonial to the late artist who has inspired millions across the globe.\nGoogle sketched out a black and white doodle, which doodle displays the caricature-doodler’s art studio that has his work desk on the left and a number of canvases on the right. In the center, Laxman can be seen sitting on a chair, sketching out “The Common Man” on a canvas; with him standing behind it, holding a newspaper.The Google logo can be seen in the background, spreading across the doodle.\nClicking on the doodle takes you to the search page where numerous sites are listed with information related to R.K. Laxman and his compositions.\nBorn on October 24, 1921, the “Pied Piper of Delhi” died on January 26, 2015, due to multi-organ failure and is now survived by his wife Kamala Laxman, son Srinivas, his daughter-in-law and his grand-daughter Mahalaxmi Laxman.\nLaxman, whose art work also includes sketches from the TV show Malgudi Days, written by his brother RK Narayan, started off with his career as a cartoonist by doing part-time jobs for local newspapers and magazines. Later, he joined The Times of India and began his daily comic strip “You Said it.”\n(With ANI inputs)\n 24, 2015 8:56 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:01:25.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
