Here are Mandel's rankings after Week 7 (Also: Feldman's Top 10 ): \nThere were no real upsets among the primary contenders, just some wild endings and statement performances. Here's where my Top 10 stands at the midpoint of the season. \n1. Utah (6-0). The Utes on Saturday beat their fifth opponent that currently holds a winning record. Once again, they did it with defense, holding Arizona State to just 257 yards and 3.7 yards per play in a 34-18 win. \n2. LSU (6-0). My biggest holdup about LSU was its passing game, but QB Brandon Harris was superb in Saturday night's 35-28 win over undefeated Florida, going 13-of-19 for 202 yards, two touchdowns and no picks. \n3. Baylor (6-0). I'm finally bumping the Bears above TCU because it's becoming clear they're a better defensive team than the Frogs. That, and they just tied an FBS record with their fifth straight 60-plus point outing. \n4. Clemson (7-0). The Tigers put up 34 points and 532 yards on a Boston College defense that came in allowing an average 7.2 points and 140.3 yards per game. Credit to QB Deshaun Watson , who tossed for 420 yards. \n5. Ohio State (7-0). It took seven games to finally feel comfortable with the Buckeyes ' offense, which found its groove against a tough Penn State defense thanks in large part to J.T. Barrett taking the reins at quarterback. \n6. TCU (7-0). Playing its third road game in four weeks, TCU allowed 21 first-quarter points to Iowa State before pitching a shutout the rest of the way. QB Trevone Boykin was superb yet again, racking up 510 total yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:27:09.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
