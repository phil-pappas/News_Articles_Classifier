The game is being played at presstime. (Bob Dungo Jr.)\nGame time is at 4 p.m.\nBut going up against the Bulldogs, UST coach Bong de la Cruz hopes his squad will execute a new tack, which is to start strong and not fall behind early, as was the case in some of their past games where they had to produce strong finishing kicks to beat their rivals.\nThe latest example was against the La Salle Green Archers last Sunday where they had to storm back from an 11-point deficit before winning, 81-79.\n“Sana next game hindi na kami come-from-behind. Kung lalamang kami sana diretso na,” said De la Cruz, who definitely has vengeance in mind against the Bulldogs.\nOne guy still hurting from that loss is UST center Karim Abdul, who was outplayed by his foreign counterpart Alfred Aroga in the fourth period.\nAroga capped off his dominance of Abdul when he knocked down a fade away jumper in the dying seconds that allowed NU to steal the victory.\n“That shot hurt me so much. I’m gonna make sure he doesn’t do that again. I’m gonna correct my mistakes and I’m gonna get myself ready this week,” Abdul said.\nMeanwhile, Ateneo is favored to beat lowly Adamson in the 2 p.m. opener and tighten its grip on the top four.\nA victory will put the Blue Eagles in a tie for third with the Green Archers.\nIn beach volleyball, defending women’s champion UST dealt favored Ateneo a second straight loss as Cherry Rondina and Rica Rivera turned back Alyssa Valdez and Bea Tan, 21-18, 21-18, yesterday at the Sands SM By The Bay.\nReigning MVP Rondina and Rivera were impressive with their well-placed shots and defense to help the Tigresses book their third straight win.\nThe setback put a dent to the title bid of the Lady Eagles, who opened the tournament with four consecutive wins, of advancing to the Final Four.\nAteneo dropped to 4-2 in a tie with UST and La Salle, a 26-24, 21-13 winner over NU, from third to fifth spots.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:46:10.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
