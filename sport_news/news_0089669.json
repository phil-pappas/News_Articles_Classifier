A poor mop-up of untaxed income mocks a government supposedly committed to unearth black money. It is less than the figure of Rs 6,500 crore Modi had mentioned in his Independence Day address and Finance Minister Jaitley is hard put to explain it away. There are several reasons for the government’s black money window attracting a small amount from tax evaders — only 638 declarations were made which yielded Rs 3,770 crore. One is those with ill-gotten wealth were not sure if the government would treat their disclosures as confidential. The fear of harassment at the hands of tax officials persisted. There was no guarantee that there would be no follow-up tax disputes and the names of those making declarations would not become public. Besides, a hefty tax of 60 per cent was levied on disclosed income. Why would people part with such large amounts when there are easier ways to turn black money into white or bring it home if stashed abroad? While hunting tax defaulters safely ensconced in tax havens abroad may not be easy, the government is not doing what is easier for it to do. Black money is sent abroad through ‘hawala’ and brought back, especially into stock markets through the non-transparent participatory notes, popularly known as “P-notes”. Every Finance minister knows this, yet each prefers to let the sleeping dogs lie. That is not all. Finance Ministry bureaucrats are very much familiar with the existence of black money; they also know the economics of tax avoidance. Though it is mandatory to make payments for real estate transactions by cheque, violations are common and there is no fear of the law. Stock markets and realty are two sectors which attract black money in a big way. Every income tax inspector knows the political leadership lacks the will and he/she too joins the charade. The meagre Rs 3,770 crore figure points to the government's lack of credibility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:28:35.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
