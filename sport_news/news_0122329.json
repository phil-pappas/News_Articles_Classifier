Winners of over 50 games in each of their last two seasons, Rip City now surrounds Damian Lillard not with LaMarcus Aldridge, Wesley Matthews, Nic Batum and Robin Lopez, but Ed Davis, Noah Vonleh, Mason Plumlee and Gerald Henderson.

Los Angeles Lakers\nRecord: 21-61\nDon't tell the Mamba, but this looks like, for what would be a third straight season, a team with no chance of competing in a loaded Western Conference. Bryant is 37 and has suffered so many setbacks and maladies in past years that he's a shell of the superstar he once was. Sharing the court with the aging former MVP are talented, but unproven young players in D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson.

Denver Nuggets\nRecord: 30-52\nThere's not much room for optimism in the Mile High City — at least, not this season.

Brooklyn Nets\nRecord: 38-44\nCenter Brook Lopez is still one of the most offensively gifted centers in the league, if he can stay on the floor. But beyond that? Thaddeus Young is a nice piece, but he's no star. Jarret Jack has been thrust into a starting roll with Deron Williams gone, and Andrea Bargnani is expected to provide valuable minutes off the bench.

New York Knicks\nRecord: 17-65\nIt's sad that the Mecca of Basketball should feature two of the league's worst teams, but that looks to be the case once again. The Knicks signed Robin Lopez and Aaron Afflalo to join 'Melo in the starting lineup, but coach Derek Fisher hasn't been able to make the Triangle take hold in the Big Apple, and it's unclear if Anthony will return to his pre-injury offensive magnificence.\nPhoto: Elsa / Getty Images 25.

Minnesota Timberwolves\nRecord: 16-66\nTimberwolves fans shouldn't fret, because their team has one of the brightest futures among NBA teams. Rookie of the Year Andrew Wiggins will be joined by No. 1 pick Karl-Anthony Towns, forming, with Ricky Rubio, what could be the most tantalizing young talent base in all basketball. This season will be another struggle, but really, this year is all about growth, not the standings.\n24. Minnesota Timberwolves\nRecord: 16-66\nTimberwolves fans shouldn't... Image 8 of 31 23.

The Pacers are attempting a more small-ball oriented approach this season with their two bigs gone, but George, coming off that gruesome injury suffered in a Team USA game, isn't thrilled .

In lieu of Jordan, the Mavs will start ZaZa Pachulia at center, while Wesley Matthews and Deron Williams combine to form a brand new backcourt. Matthews is coming off a torn ACL, but if he can regain his pre-injury form, his signing could be a steal. Still, in the West, Dallas will find it hard to slither into the No. 8 seed.\nPhoto: Don Emmert / Getty Images 18. Dallas Mavericks\nRecord: 50-32\nDuped by DeAndre Jordan, the... Image 14 of 31 17. Detroit Pistons\nRecord: 32-50\nWith both Josh Smith and Greg Monroe gone, Detroit's paint is now the sole property of Andre Drummond.

Utah Jazz\nRecord: 38-44\nThe resurgence of Utah coincided with the departure of Enes Kanter and the fast rise of the Stifle Tower, Rudy Gobert. The loss of Dante Exum stings, but Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors continue honing new facets of their game every offseason, and if Alec Burcks can just be competent , the Jazz can return to the playoffs for the first time since 2012.\n16.

He's what makes this team go; the pistons, the fuel, the flow, everything. Wall and Bradley Beal form a deadly tandem, and Marcin Gortat and Nene look like they belong in a biker gang. Paul Pierce switched coasts, but Otto Porter, still just 22, is as gifted as any young small forward, it's just a matter of putting it together.\nPhoto: Kathy Willens /Associated Press 15.

Boston Celtics\nRecord: 40-42\nTheir best player is 5-foot-9 and comes off the bench, but Isaiah Thomas works like a fuse which ignites that offense anytime he enters the game. Marcus Smart and Avery Bradley are two of the best backcourt defenders in the league, and David Lee, Kelly Olynyk, Amir Johnson and Jared Sullinger form a strong frontcourt rotation. There's no superstar here, but Brad Stevens is skilled when it comes to molding lesser pieces into a greater whole.\nPhoto: Winslow Townson, AP Photo 14.

He was probably Atlanta's best player for most of the playoffs, but is he enough to push Toronto into the title conversation?

As the No. 6 seed, the Bucks pushed Chicago to a Game 6 in the first round of the playoffs. Greg Monroe is in. Jabari Parker is back. The Greek Freak keeps getting, well, freakier (in a good way). The bench is deep and, while they still can't shoot, their overall length should make it difficult for the opposition to score much at will.\nPhoto: Dave Tulis, AP 12.

And already, the new coach is dealing with some of Thib's old woes in the form of another Derrick Rose injury . Rose should be back for the regular-season opener, but much of what this team can accomplish will rely, not on Rose, but Jimmy Butler.

Was Hassan Whiteside an ephemeral flash of basketball brilliance, or something more? Will Chris Bosh return fully healthy? Can Dwayne Wade stay healthy? How will the Goran Dragic-Wade-Luol Deng-Bosh-Whiteside lineup coexist? With Erik Spoelstra at the helm, it's possible, but chances are this team won't become an immediate sensation.

Atlanta Hawks\nRecord: 60-22\nDeMarre Carroll, such a key factor in the Hawk's shocking success, is North of the border, but Atlanta did well to replace him with Tiago Splitter and Tim Hardaway Jr. Hardaway is no Carroll, but he's young, and should benefit from the tutelage of coach Mike Budenholzer.

New Orleans Pelicans\nRecord: 45-37\nIt's easy to forget, because the Pellies were swept, how much of a force Anthony Davis was against the Warriors in his first playoff series. At just 22 years old, the \"Brow\" may already be the best basketball player in the world, and he's yet to reach his pinnacle. LeBron may still claim status as King, but there's a worthy heir with a massive shadow looming in the wings.\nPhoto: Dan McCarney 8.

Remember, they pushed the Warriors harder than any team.\n7. Memphis Grizzlies\nRecord: 55-27\nMarc Gasol nixed the extravagant... Image 25 of 31 6. Houston Rockets\nRecord: 56-26\nPeople love to hate the Rockets, but they won't care, as long as they keep tallying wins. If Ty Lawson can get his head right, he could form, with James Harden, a backcourt to match, or at least battle, the one in Oakland. Dwight Howard, despite his putrid free throw shooting, still controls games with his defensive brilliance, and Donatas Motiejunas has the makings of an excellent complementary piece, if only he can stay healthy.\nPhoto: Scott Halleran /Getty Images 6.
