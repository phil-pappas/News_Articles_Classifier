Hello, ASFN family! I have a real treat for you. I'm taking my 3 year old son to his first Cards game on Sunday! We need somewhere to hang out and pregame! If you like beer, want to meet K9 at his most paternal, and usually end up with an extra couple hot dogs before kickoff, please PM me and let me know where we can find you! Location: Gilbert, Arizona Posts: 5,593 We're bringing the 2 year old and the 6 week old, but we usually arrive right at kickoff. My kiddo's toddler DVOA is totally better than yours! I hope everyone buys you a beer and pours it on you.... Then buys you two more to apologize. Enjoy the game! My 7 year old daughter keeps asking me when we're gonna go there but I think I'm gonna wait (we've been to Suns, Coyotes, Diamondbacks, and she cant stand still for long let alone not whine/complain about how long it takes) Location: Albq Posts: 6,102 Andy440 invites everyone to his tailgate. If you remember the Aussies or the Brazilian axe murderer, both were welcome there. 4 of us from Albuquerque are invading Sunday. His location is in the very corner of the great lawn right by the number 1 entrance. 100' from the stage. WR Frank Sanders shows up a lot too. We're bringing extra brats and brewskis. plenty safe for kids....no wild drunks.... just the occasional axe murderer. Quote: Originally Posted by kerouac9 Hello, ASFN family!
