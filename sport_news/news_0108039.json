(AP) — A Nashville judge has postponed the trial of two former Vanderbilt football players who were convicted of rape but ordered to be retried. \nFormer players Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey had been scheduled to be retried Nov. 30. A Nashville judge granted a request Monday for the delay over objections from prosecutors, who said the victim had already been through one trial and had set time aside in November for the retrial. \nCriminal Court Judge Monte Watkins agreed that new lawyers hired by Vandenburg needed more time to prepare. \nA jury convicted both players in January of raping an unconscious female student in a dorm room at the Nashville school. The verdicts were thrown out after it was revealed that a juror failed to disclose that he had been a victim of statuary rape.
