Matthews had a team-leading 15 tackles for a defense that forced two turnovers.\n\"We've been battle tested,\" Matthews said. \"We pretty well passed the test today. We didn't have anything special. All we had to do was to run to the ball.\"\nMatthews was told before the game he would be the key for the Rams defense. His main assignment, especially early, was to shadow Air Force quarterback Karson Roberts.\n\"I think I did my job for the most part pretty good,\" Matthews said. \"Wherever the quarterback went, I went. I was the director of the defense for the most part.\"\nRoberts led the Falcons in rushing with 79 yards, but he managed only an average of 3.3 yards on 24 carries.\nRoberts had no rebuttal of Matthews' assessment of his play.\n\"He (Matthews) was filling the holes pretty fast and running the alleys pretty well,\" Roberts said of Matthews. \"They had a lot of flow back and forth and that made it hard for us. They outplayed us today.\"\nAlthough they are an annual opponent, Matthews noted that the Falcons confused the Rams at times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:24:28.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
