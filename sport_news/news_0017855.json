Umpires ruled it a legal play Saturday night. \nTorre says after a thorough review from all angles, he concluded Utley's slide merited a penalty. \nThere was no immediate word on whether Utley would appeal, which could keep him eligible to play Games 3 and 4 this week in New York. The best-of-five NL Division Series is tied at one apiece.
