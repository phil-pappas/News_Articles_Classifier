(Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNA) \nWILMINGTON When a pregame thunderstorm drenched Baynard Stadium and delayed the kickoff for 24 minutes, Middletown and Salesianum knew the ball would be wet and slippery. \nThe Cavaliers fumbled it. The Sals held on to it. And that made all the difference. \nKyle Cathers and Marek Easton each recovered two fumbles, and Colby Reeder rushed 30 times for 181 yards and a touchdown as No. 3 Salesianum sloshed to a 20-6 victory over No. 2 Middletown on Friday night. \nThe Sals (4-1) didn’t do anything spectacular on the attack. But since its three scoring drives only covered a combined 58 yards following Cavaliers turnovers, Salesianum didn’t really need a big offensive game. \n“I was very happy with our kids. We forced a lot of turnovers,” Sallies coach Bill DiNardo said. “We were very opportunistic. \n“I thought our defense played great. Our offense, we did what we had to do.” \nMiddletown fumbled on its second play from scrimmage, and Cathers pounced on it at the Cavaliers 31. The Sals took eight plays to punch it in, with Garrett Cannon crossing the line on a 2-yard keeper to make it 7-0 with 4:25 left in the opening quarter. \nSallies’ next big play was an interception, as a Middletown pass deflected off a receiver and into the hands of Evan Mullin at the Cavaliers 8. The senior linebacker returned it to the 2, and Reeder took a toss to the left to score on the next play. The PAT was blocked, leaving the Sals with a 13-0 lead with 10:19 to go in the second quarter. \nMiddletown’s next drive was stopped when Easton jumped on a loose ball at the Cavaliers 36. After a Sallies punt, Vincent DelPercio flipped a screen pass to Kedrick Whitehead that appeared to go for a 68-yard Middletown TD. But the Cavaliers were whistled for an illegal man downfield. \nSalesianum moved into position to score again, but the Cavaliers picked off a pass at their own 5 with 19 seconds left in the half. \nSalesianum quarterback Garrett Cannon looks for a receiver in the second quarter of the Sals' 20-6 win at Baynard Stadium Friday.

Whitehead took a simple handoff up the middle on the Cavaliers’ first play and went 74 yards untouched. The PAT was blocked, but Middletown pulled within 13-6. \n“The one play that they scored big on, I was kind of disappointed,” DiNardo said. “But that’s football, and they’re a talented team. That’s a lesson for us, you can’t let down on any play.” \nThe charged-up Cavaliers forced a punt, but fumbled on their next play. Easton was in the right place at the right time, and the senior lineman recovered it at the Middletown 25. Griffin Salvo took a reverse all the way on the next play, and just like that the Sals’ lead was up to 20-6. \nMiddletown (3-2) didn’t give up, as DelPercio consistently completed short passes to move the ball down the field. But the Cavaliers fumbled again on first-and-10 from the Sallies 20, and Cathers fell on it to extinguish another drive with 7:52 to play. \nThe Cavaliers forced a punt, and moved inside the 10 on three DelPercio completions. But the Sals’ defense came up big again, as linebacker Will Stradley broke through to stop Whitehead for a 1-yard loss on fourth-and-1 at the 3 with 3:12 remaining. \nDelPercio completed 15 of 25 passes for 117 yards. But outside of Whitehead’s one big run, Middletown’s other 23 carries went for minus-2 yards. \nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com .
