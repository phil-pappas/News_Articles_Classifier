It was roughly three years ago on a crisp fall morning as she manned a deer blind deep in the heart of her 8,000 acre deer lease situated along the Neches River bottom. Gehrmann, now 26, recalled the deer as a handsome buck with a near perfect crown adorned with tall, impressive tines. “He was probably 4 1/2-years old with eight, maybe 10 points,” said Gehrmann, a Nacogdoches native who works as a registered nurse at a Bryan hospital. “He was a great buck - so symmetrical and perfect.” Interestingly, Gehrmann elected not to shoot the buck. In fact, she never even clicked her Winchester .270 off safety. That’s because she could tell by evaluating the deer that he was just beginning to come into his prime and had the makings of becoming something extremely special. “Our golden standard for taking trophy bucks on our lease is 5 1/2 years old or older,” Gehrmann said. “The reason we do that is it gives them opportunity to mature and reach their full potential. Once they reach 5 1/2 they are mature and post-mature after that. If it sounds like Gehrmann knows a thing or two about deer hunting and judging deer on the hoof, that’s because she does. She has been hunting alongside her dad, Bill, since she was 10 and has taken nearly a half dozen bucks that she considers to be trophies. She set the club record in 2013 with an outstanding 16 pointer that grossed 178 Boone and Crockett inches. Amazingly, she crushed that record on Oct. 9. Just in case you’re wondering, the club where Gehrmann hunts is under a Level 3 managed lands deer program approved by the state. The program allows the club and other Level 3 properties around Texas to open their rifle season in coincidence with the statewide Archery Only season, which got underway Oct. 3 this year. The MLD permits allow well managed clubs the opportunity enjoy more flexible seasons and increased harvest opportunities in order to help keep their deer herds in check. Another built-in advantage of the early season is it allows rifle hunters to get in the woods and tend to business before the meat of the rut gets underway, which often causes territorial bucks to scatter like quail in search of does or wreck their antlers in sparring matches with other bucks that challenge their dominance. To hear Gehrmann tell it, the remarkable buck she shot earlier this month was particularly bad about scrapping with other bucks. It was a personality trait that earned him the nickname “Patròn” (it means “Boss” in Spanish) many moons ago. “I’ve seen him busted up several times over the years, and it usually happened by the end of October or by early November,” Gehrmann said. Gehrmann and some of the guides at the lease collected numerous trail camera pictures of Patròn over the summer and it was plain to see his kingsize crown had stacked on more mass and tine length than the year before. Based on expert evaluations that had the buck coming in at about 7 1/2 years of age, she made the decision to take the the deer this season if the chance presented itself. “I’d waited a long time for this -- he was fully mature now,” she said. “My brother (Will) and a few other members had the option to take him if they got the chance, but everyone knew I had dibs on that buck.” Gehrmann said the buck had been visiting several of her stand sites leading up to the season, but there was one spot in particular that grabbed her attention on that fateful Friday morning. The two man box blind is situated at the south end of a large food plot with a corn feeder nearby. It was the perfect set-up for the light northernly breeze that was in the forecast. “One thing I always worry about with my deer hunting is the wind,” she said. “I had seen him a lot at this stand over the years, but I had been holding off on hunting it this season because I didn’t want to risk hunting it with the wrong wind.” Gehrmann said she and her father slipped into the box blind at about 6:15 a.m. and waited patiently for the first hint of daylight. The hunt got interesting about 35 minutes later when she caught some movement about 150 yards in the distance at the edge of the food plot. “I grabbed my binoculars and I knew immediately it was him. There was no mistaking that deer,” Gehrman said. Gehrmann said her father the checked the buck over before she attempted to take the shot, just to make sure he hadn’t broken any tines. When something weird happened. “I could tell something was bothering him - he was acting kind of skittish,” she said. “Then, all of the sudden he spooked and took off into the brush. I thought he was gone.” About five minutes later the culprit showed up. The hunter said she had been watching the doe for two minutes when the Patròn reappeared and moved within about 100 yards before freezing in his tracks. Realizing the buck might bolt any second, Gehrmann took a deep breath and touched the trigger. She said the deer briefly buckled down in front and took off into the dense brush. Within seconds, text messages from some of the lease guides began rolling in to confirm what she already knew. “The guys who heard the shot said it sounded like the bullet had hit a brick wall,” she said. Gehrmann said she and her dad waited about 15 minutes before they got down to look for any promising signs. The lady hunter found the buck in short order, just inside the wood line. “It was such an awesome experience,” she said. “My dad and I have always hunted together and I’m blessed to be able to spend that time with him. While Gehrmann’s outstanding 12 pointer has yet to be officially scored, the Texas Big Game Awards website lists it at 205 6/8 as a non-typical. Gehrmann says that is a gross “rough” score and plans to have the rack officially scored soon. Either way, it is sure to rank as one of the top bucks taken in eastern Texas this season and one of the best ever from Anderson County.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:04:05.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
