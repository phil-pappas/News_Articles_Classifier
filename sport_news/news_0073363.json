Afternoon temperatures reached the 60s in the east, 70s in the central South Dakota and even middle 80s were found in the west! \nMostly clear to clear skies can be expected tonight with lows in the 40s to near 50 degrees. Winds calm down to the 5 to 10 mph range. \nMonday will have a few clouds drift over KELOLAND ahead of the next rain system, but mostly sunny skies are likely. Afternoon highs will once again be above average, reaching the 70s. \nThis coming week has a chance for rain. An area of upper level low pressure could get cut off from the jet stream and get stuck over the desert southwest. If that happens, the Midwest will see a few rounds of light rain with the heavier rain event at the end of the week when the upper level low gets pulled back into the jet stream. Otherwise, partly sunny skies between the rains with highs mostly in the 60s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:05:59.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
