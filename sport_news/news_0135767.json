(Katherine Dunn, Glenn Graham) \nThe Clippers reached the state Class 2A semifinals in 2013 and aim to rebound from a 6-4 finish last fall that kept them out of the playoffs. \n\"Our experience has a whole lot to do with it,\" Mitchell said of this year's success. \"We're not as talented as we have been in the past, but this team has experience and they know what they're doing. They've been through it so many times and they really understand the system.\" \nPatterson's biggest win came two weeks ago, 16-14, at Dunbar, a state Class 2A finalist last season. The Mustangs opened their season with a 12-10 win over South Hagerstown which looked more impressive two weeks later when the Rebels edged then-No. 5 South Carroll, 21-20. \nBoth teams have solid quarterbacks with versatile offenses but the key to victory for both may lie in the defensive line. \nThe Mustangs' line is built on defensive ends Ali and Dejuan Dallas and tackles Myles and Kevin Johnson . Ali has 19 sacks this season, including five in last week's 51-6 win over Northwestern. With those quick linemen and the linebackers, Mervo has done a good job stopping the run, Nixon said. \nThe Clippers have a solid running game and they can also air it out. Pugh, who Nixon said is the best quarterback in the city league, has passed for 259 yards and four touchdowns and run for 100 yards. Wright has run 47 times for 359 yards and six touchdowns and caught five passes for 72 yards and two touchdowns. \nPatterson's defense uses a three-man front — Latimer, Jackson and Edwards — aiming to prevent the long ball, something Mitchell said will be key against the Mustangs. Pugh, who doubles as a linebacker, and Wright, a defensive back, can also wreak havoc on that side of the ball, combining for 25 tackles, three forced fumbles, two interceptions and a sack. \nMervo's veteran quarterback Nicholson has thrown for 655 yards and 12 touchdowns while Ben has caught 17 passes for 312 yards and three touchdowns. \nThe Mustangs' defense has allowed just 30 points and the Clippers have given up 38. \n\"I think it's going to be almost like a boxing fight, 12 rounds and whoever's the last team standing is going to be the winner,\" Nixon said. \"I think it's going to be a low-scoring, very physical game. You just can't blink. You can't hesitate. You can't stop battling until the end. And of course the turnovers and the mistakes — whoever makes the fewest, that's the team that's going to come out on top.\" \nOTHER GAMES TO WATCH \nNo. 9 John Carroll at Boys' Latin, Friday, 3:45 p.m. \nNo. 15 Arundel at No. 10 Broadneck, Friday, 6:30 p.m. \nNo. 7 Archbishop Spalding at Calvert Hall, Friday, 7 p.m. \nGlenelg at Reservoir, Friday, 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:53:45.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
