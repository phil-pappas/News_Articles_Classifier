The Aggies' offense scored 35 points off eight Bronco turnovers for a 52-26 win in Maverik Stadium Friday night. \nWhile the defense performance stands out above the rest, the Aggies executed in all three phases Friday night to get possibly the biggest win in program history. Offense: A- \nMaybe I'm being a bit harsh on an Aggie offense that dropped 52 points on a very tough Boise State team. Despite the glorious win, there was definite room for improvement for the offense. A lot of penalties and bad first-down plays got the Aggies behind the chains. \nThat said, the Aggies did score 35 points off the eight turnovers that were gifted to them. The Utah State offense was perfect on the red zone again this week, not having to settle for a field goal once. They did have a turnover on downs in the red zone at the end of the game, but it didn't really count. The Aggies also rushed for 177 yards, which is well above the Broncos' average per game of 60. Three of the four Aggies rushers in the game averaged 3.5 yards a carry or higher. Defense: A++ \nThe Aggies' defense forced eight turnovers. Seven of those came in the first half as the Aggie defense set the tone of the game early and often. It held Boise State to -26 yards of offense in the first quarter, which really allowed the Aggies to jump in front early and not look back. \nEven in the second half when the game was out of reach, the Aggie defense held strong and started the second half forcing its eighth and final turnover. The pressure the front seven were able to put on Boise State quarterback Brett Rypien left him rattled early and often. The Aggie defense ended the night with four sacks and five quarterback hurries. Rypien finished the night with just a 50 percent completion percentage, 299 yards, three interceptions. The biggest, a 90-yard interception return by Marwin Evans, gave Utah State a five-touchdown lead heading into the half. Special teams: A- \nOne complaint about last week in Fresno was the missed extra points by Brock Warren. Warren got the jitters out this week and went seven for seven on extra points. Jake Thompson added a key 51-yard field goal midway through the first that helped the Aggies keep the momentum. Thompson also allowed only one kickoff return, which was stopped for just 16 yards. \nDalton Baker was able to put two of his seven punts inside the 20-yard line. His average of 40.3 was not great but was good enough to allow the defense room to make plays. The only negative play for special teams was allowing a 38-yard punt return by Shane Williams-Rhode in the first quarter that led directly to a Bronco field goal. \nOverall, it was an incredible performance in all three phases of the game to beat the 20th-ranked team in the nation. The Mountain Division-leading Aggies now turn their attention to West Division leader San Diego State. \nParker Robertson is a graduate of Utah State University, a freelance contributor and an avid fan of sports.
