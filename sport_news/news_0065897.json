The Titans advanced to the College World Series last year built on a staff ERA of 2.89, which was the worse during his three-year tenure. \nDietrich built his career on the west coast. Prior to Cal State Fullerton, he worked as the pitching coach for UC Irvine. He coached the Anteaters for five seasons. Prior to his stint in Irvine, Dietrich was the recruiting coordinator for UC Los Angeles, a Division II school. He also coached in the junior college ranks at Los Angeles City College. \nHis only experience outside of the west coast came in 2004 and 2005 with the Hyannis Mets in the Cape Cod League. \nDietrich would replace Thompson, who had been with MSU coach John Cohen since 2009. \nContact Michael Bonner at mbonner@jackson.gannett.com.
