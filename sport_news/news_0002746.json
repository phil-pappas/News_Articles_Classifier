A Long Island woman’s not-so-bright idea to get help with her stolen handbag was a real bomb with cops.\nLisa Ruberto’s day trip to Manhattan ended with her pocketbook still missing — and her arrest for calling in a phony bomb threat, police said Friday.\n“She made a poor judgment, a very poor judgment,” said her mother, Caroline Ruberto.\nThe incident happened Oct. 10, when Ruberto was hitting the town with a pal. They were in the lobby of the swanky Gansevoort Hotel in the Meatpacking District when somebody made off with Ruberto’s purse, which was stuffed with $2000 for some car repairs.\nDario Cantatore/Getty Images The Long Island woman and a friend were in the Gansevoort Hotel in the Meatpacking District when somebody apparently made off with Ruberto’s purse.\n“She was just absolutely beside herself,” her mom said.\nPolice said that Ruberto called 911 twice within a matter of minutes — but instead of saying her purse had been stolen, she initially said she was involved in some sort of family dispute.\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID OR IOS\nShe then called back to say she thought a bomb might explode in the hotel, cops said.\nFacebook Ruberto (r.) decided to get help by calling 911 and reporting a bomb, police allege.\nA patrol car arrived first. Ruberto identified herself, said her bag had been taken, then quickly admitted she had made the two bogus calls “because she figured police would get there quicker if they thought there was a bomb there,”one source said.\nAt that point, Bomb Squad and Emergency Service cops that had been sent to the hotel were called off.\nPolice then took her stolen bag report.\nShe told police she put down her $130 Free People bag — though she couldn’t remember where she put it — and left it unattended, then realized it was gone.\nInside the bag were her credit cards, driver’s license and about $2,200 cash for the car repairs.\nRuberto was then arrested for reckless endangerment and issued a desk appearance ticket. She is due back in court next month.\nShe declined comment when reached Friday at the Southampton clothing she works at.\nHer mom said her daughter’s “a good girl.”\n“She works three jobs,” she said.\nFacebook Lisa Ruberto is seen in Facebook photos.
