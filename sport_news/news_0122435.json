A determination on whether or not he will go on IR has not been made. â€” Detroit Lions (@Lions) October 14, 2015 \nLevy missed the first four games of the season with a hip injury, but started in Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals. \nHe aggravated the injury before halftime and did not return for the rest of the game. \nDuring his press conference on Monday, Caldwell said Levy would consult with team doctors, who would make the final determination about what he should do. Earlier in the season, medical personnel did not think surgery was needed. \nThis offseason, the linebacker signed a four-year, $33 million contract extension. \nLast season, Levy had his best year with 151 tackles, 15 tackles for loss and 2 1/2 sacks. He also had an interception and a safety.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:04:42.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
