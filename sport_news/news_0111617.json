He’s a great athlete. He’s playing well. So I know what I have to do.” \nSlovak Martin Klizan beat local favourite Zhang Ze 7-6(8), 6-2 and now runs into top seed Novak Djokovic, who is gunning for his ninth title of the year. \nCroatia’s Ivo Karlovic, who prevailed 6-4, 7-6(6) over Frenchman Jeremy Chardy, also faces a formidable second-round opponent in 2009 runner-up Rafa Nadal, who lost to Djokovic in the China Open final on Sunday. \nAmerican John Isner burnished his big-serving reputation with 20 aces in a 6-1, 6-2 romp against Adrian Mannarino, while Roberto Bautista Agut also had it easy against fellow Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, whom he beat 6-2, 6-3. \nAmerican Steve Johnson cut short Italian Andreas Seppi’s campaign with a 4-6, 6-1, 7-6(2) win. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:29:31.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
