I would step back, listen to them and could only wish that I was that young again,” Custer said. “All of them had a willingness to learn and have really done well in their personal and professional lives.” \nCuster had a 33-year career with the former Isaly’s Dairy and at age 50, had what he felt was a better opportunity when he left for the Mill Creek Dairy. \nAround the same time, he brought to Morris Sports many innovative ideas, but none as important as treating customers with the respect that they deserved. \nEd Reese, owner of Briarfield Health Care and EDM Management, worked with Custer from 1972-77. \nThe former Mahoning County commissioner, who organized the event, called Custer a one-of-a-kind boss. \n“I started out stringing tennis racquets, moved to the floor in sales and then became Lefty Rowan’s assistant in making deliveries. We had everything from swim suits to scuba diving equipment and uniforms to outfit teams in any sport,” Reese said. “Clarence was way ahead of his time. I learned to deal with people by watching him and his excellent demeanor when working with the public.” \nReese’s brother, Ralph, currently an administrator with Altercare of Louisville, worked at the store throughout his high school years and helped move the business into its Market Street location. \n“All of us were taught an unbelievable work ethic by Clarence and Paul we continue to use that knowledge today,” Ralph Reese said. “They also understood that Friday night was game night and they wanted us to enjoy our scholastic years, so they didn’t schedule us to work those days.” \nPaul Hershey, Parks’ son-in-law, worked with the store when he came out of the U.S. Navy and while attending YSU. \n“It didn’t seem like work because Clarence made it so much fun. We interacted with everyone and waited on what seemed like the, ‘Who’s Who’ of Mahoning Valley sports,” Hershey said. \nRon Wharmby, current owner of Wharmby Sports in Liberty, worked with Custer from 1970-76, crediting both Custer and Morris with learning the business. \n“We learned to multi-task and did everything that was asked of us. Everyone just appreciated how they were treated by ownership and management,” Wharmby said. \nOther former workers attending included Joyce Markovitch (daughter of Ben Scharsu, owner of the former Youngstown Sporting Goods on Champion Street in Youngstown), local attorney Kevin Murphy, manager of their Liberty Plaza location, and Rick Nelson, owner of Floors ‘R Us who made the trek from Long Beach, Miss.
