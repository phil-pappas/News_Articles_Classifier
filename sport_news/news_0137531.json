Collins’ Mets will try to do in 2015 what Leyland’s Tigers couldn’t in 2006 and 2012: Follow up an LCS sweep with a World Series victory. With Game 1 Tuesday in Kansas City or Toronto, the Mets will have been off for five days.\nIn ’06, Detroit swept past Oakland in the American League finals to reach its first Fall Classic since 1984. There, after six days of rest, the Tigers fell to the Cardinals in five games.\nIn ’12, the Tigers swept over the Yankees in the ALCS — remembered in these parts as the series in which Derek Jeter broke his left ankle, or when Alex Rodriguez hit on a woman in the stands during a game — and then got swept by the Giants, after five days off.\nThose speak to a greater trend: According to the Elias Sports Bureau, of the previous seven teams that swept a best-of-seven LCS (a format that began in 1985), only one, the 1995 Braves, went onto win the World Series. In addition to the 2012 Tigers, two more of those clubs — Sandy Alderson’s 1990 A’s and the 2007 Rockies — got swept in the World Series.\n“We waited around, and we never wanted to use that as an excuse. We never would,” Leyland said. “I think that would disrespectful to the Cardinals and San Francisco. I do think you can get in a little lull. You’re thinking about what you’ve accomplished.”\nThere’s another part of the equation: The 2006 Cardinals and 2012 Giants both needed seven games to dispose of their NLCS foes.\n“I do think it gives you that edge,” Leyland said. “You’re actually playing, and you’re having to win those games. It does maintain that edge that you get.”\nThe Blue Jays and Royals will play ALCS Game 6 on Friday night in Kansas City, and if Toronto wins, the clubs will play Game 7 on Saturday night.\nLeyland’s Tigers worked diligently to combat the loss of their edge. In the cold Michigan weather, they spent a day in 2006 working out at Ford Field, the domed home of the NFL’s Lions, focusing on fundamentals. That Fall Classic became known as the one in which a Tigers pitcher committed a throwing error in all five games.\nIn 2012, the Tigers flew up their Instructional League club from Florida to compete in scrimmages against their big-leaguers. That didn’t help, either.\n“If you don’t see competitive live competition for a while, it can be difficult,” Leyland said.\nIf Jacob deGrom starts Game 1 for the Mets, he would do so on six days’ rest. Yet Noah Syndergaard, Matt Harvey and Steven Matz all would pitch with a minimum of nine days off. MLB.com reported Thursday that in the wild-card era (since 1995), pitchers starting on nine-plus days of rest in the World Series have put up a 14-23 record with a 4.36 ERA.\nEven perfection has its price. We’ll see if the Mets can solve this finals dilemma to attain their final goal.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under jim leyland ,  new york mets ,  world series", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:00:20.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
