He had 10 catches for 148 yards in a win over the Jaguars on Sunday to become the first player in NFL history with nine or more catches and 145 or more yards receiving in three straight games.\nIt was Hopkins’ fourth straight 100-yard receiving game to tie Johnson for the longest such streak in team history. Hopkins’ 2,738 yards receiving are second in franchise history in a player’s first three seasons behind Johnson’s 2,806 yards and he has 10 games remaining.\nIf Hopkins continues at his current pace he would finish the season with 1,936 yards receiving, which would surpass the franchise mark of 1,598 yards Johnson had in 2012.\nHopkins’ 726 yards receiving through six games are the second-most in the NFL since 1960 behind the 785 yards Wes Welker piled up in 2011. Third on that list is Hall of Famer Michael Irvin , who had 712 in 1993.\nHopkins, who was selected as the AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Wednesday, isn’t too keen on talking about his individual accomplishments with the team off to a tough start.\n“Our record is 2-4, so there’s nothing really to be too amazed about,” he said when asked about his performance.\nBut the 27th overall pick in the 2013 draft is certainly OK with others raving about his work.\n“Why not? I guess I’m doing historical stuff right now,” he said. “I guess you guys should be amazed.”\nAlong with leading the league in yards receiving he’s also near the top in several other statistical categories. His 52 receptions rank second, his five touchdowns receptions are tied for second, his 42 first downs are the most in the league and his 15 receptions on third down lead all players.\nMore Information Texans (2-4)\nat Dolphins (2-3)\nKickoff: Noon today, Sun Life Stadium, Miami\nTV/Radio: CBS, DirecTV (Ch. 710), KZDC-AM 1250 & FM 94.5\nLine: Dolphins by 4½, O/U 44½\nSeries: Texans lead 7-0.\nLast meeting: Texans won 30-10 on Sept. 9, 2012.\nHis success, according to players and coaches alike, is a product of his hard work and dedication.\n“He’s got a great work ethic, and there’s really no substitute for that, and I think that has a lot to do with where he is right now,” coach Bill O’Brien said.\nHopkins is only 6-feet-1, but his hands measure 10 inches from thumb to pinkie. His extra-large mitts allow him to make catches many receivers simply wouldn’t be able to snag.\nHe had two catches Sunday against Jacksonville using just one hand. The first came when he reached out with his left hand and grabbed a back-shoulder pass for 16 yards.\nThe second one that had everyone buzzing came when he trapped the ball with one hand against the side of his helmet for a 29-yard gain in the fourth quarter.\n“We were sitting in there watching it the other day reviewing it,” Hoyer said. “And Arian (Foster) just starts clapping and he’s like, ‘You’re going to pretend like that wasn’t just like the most amazing catch you’ve seen?’ I mean it really is when you think about it.”\nOffensive coordinator George Godsey was asked if they plan to keep throwing Hopkins’ way that much.\n“We’ll see how the defense defends him each week,” Godsey said.", "external_links": ["https://myaccount.expressnews.com/dssSubscribe.aspx?pid=495&z=00000", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/50/8845882/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/50/8845883/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/50/8845884/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/50/8845883/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/50/8845885/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/50/8845884/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/50/8845882/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/50/8845885/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:18:11.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
