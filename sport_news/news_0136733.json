He's very tenacious and he's got a lot of quality about him. \n'We see him on the edge of his own box making great blocks.' \nIan Wright in his analysis of Andre Ayew picked a list of attributes for the Ghana international that sets him apart from other strikers. \nThe former Arsenal player said:'I thought he was a forward but he's far more than that.' He chases back He wins his team free kicks with clever play He makes dangerous runs into the box He has great technical ability and passes with both feet He plays exquisite through balls to Bafetimbi Gomis He's struck up a great relationship with Gomis He creates time and space for the players around him He's got a rocket shot His headed goal was 'fantastic' because it was so powerful \nAlan Shearer also added:'We often hear about foreign players needing time to adapt to the Premier League. \n'Not this guy, he's into it straight away and he looks like he's enjoying his football.'
