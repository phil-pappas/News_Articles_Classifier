With three goals and one assist against the Palisade Bulldogs, Horning now has 17 goals on the year and is closing in on the Western Slope League leading goal scorer award. In the 7-0 win over the Bulldogs, Wednesday, at Stubler Memorial Field, the Demons honored seven seniors — Ryan Nott, Juan Martinez, Daniel Casillas, Mason Yellico, Will Osier, Camilo Landa and Horning — in their final home regular season appearance for the Demons. Every senior played in the blowout win, with Martinez netting two goals, Osier coming up with two assists, Casillas and Yellico adding one assist each, Nott recording three saves to preserve the shutout and Landa playing terrific defense in front of Nott. But it was Horning and Martinez who stole the show for the Demons, namely Martinez who came a long way this year. In his final regular season home game, Martinez netted two big goals late for the Demons to cap off the win. “Juan was big for us tonight,” Demons head coach Wayne Smith said. “He has been a great player for us all year, and I’m just so proud of him. It was so nice to see him have a big night on senior night.” Miguel “Papas” Peralta started off the scoring for the Demons with a goal in the 10th minute of the first half off of an assist from Horning. Horning then followed up with a goal of his own in the 21st minute off of a feed from Casillas to make it 2-0 Demons. Alex Trejo added a goal of his own in the first half for Glenwood Springs with an unassisted goal in the 34th minute to put the Demons up 3-0 with more than an entire half to go. From there, Horning added two goals (38th and 40th minutes) before Martinez netted his two goals to close it out. “It was a great night overall,” Smith said. “We started off well and really got after them offensively in the first half. Our possession was really great tonight and allowed us to control the tempo.” With the win, the Demons move to 8-5 (5-4) on the year. They will travel to Battle Mountain, Saturday, and Summit Oct. 20 to close out the regular season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:35:46.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
