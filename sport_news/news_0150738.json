The plated dinner and dressy affair will be held at the Multi-Purpose, Academics and Athletics Center (MAAC) at Monmouth University, which is a partner in the event.\n“We are thrilled to put on this one-of-a kind banquet in New Jersey for student athletes,” said Hollis R. Towns, the Press’ executive editor and VP of News. “We are planning to honor more than 700 student athletes in what we are hoping will be an annual event.”\nFans and family members will have the opportunity to purchase tickets for the red carpet event, while students who are named to our seasonal All-Shore first or second teams will be our invited guests. Additionally, our weekly high school football Players of the Week will receive an invitation. Sponsorships will be offered to local businesses to purchase tables for the invited athletes along with other ways to support the event.\nTowns said the Press wants the community to support this event in every way possible.\n“With Eli as our keynote speaker, and other high-caliber guests being lined up, this will be a first-class event,” Towns said. “Think of the ESPYs or the Oscars, and you’d be close to the caliber of event we will be putting on. This will be something special!”\nMore details will be posted as they are finalized, including how to sponsor a table and support the event.\nIn addition to showcasing local talent, The Press will announce our Players of the Year at the program and several fun awards. We’ll soon launch a contest allowing readers to vote on the best cheerleading squad, best marching band, best mascot and biggest fan, among others. Winners will be announced at the banquet.\nIt’s all about being a part of the fabric of the community.\n“Our commitment to covering local news and supporting the local community has never been greater,” Towns said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:06:13.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
