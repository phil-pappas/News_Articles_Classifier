This time what I had, with my not having the control of my nerves or my emotion, is like coming back from an injury, too,\" he told reporters.\n\"It's not a physical injury, but it's a mental injury. And this for me is another challenge.\"\nDespite the lopsided scoreline in Sunday's final against the world number one, seventh-ranked Nadal enjoyed a positive tournament in Beijing as he reached his first hardcourt title match all year.\nAnd the 29-year-old maintained he was heading in the right direction to return to the sort of level which has brought him 14 Grand Slam titles.\n\"I am working hard. I've never had such a long period of time without playing at the level that I wanted,\" Nadal said.\n\"I lost the matches that I should win, close matches, third-set matches. None of these important matches, I won none of those ones. So sometimes it's like a restart,\" he added.\n\"I believe that I am much better. I don't know what the results are going to be till the end of the season. But I really believe if I continue with the same quality of practices, the same health of my body, I really hope and I believe that I can start the next year with (more) energy and I believe another level.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:10:53.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
