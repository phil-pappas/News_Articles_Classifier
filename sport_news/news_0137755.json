We lacked precision on our counter attacks.\"\nBenitez, who brought on fit-again attacking midfielder Gareth Bale in place of playmaker Isco with around half an hour to go, said he had taken Benzema off because he wanted fresh legs on the wing.\n\"With Bale's speed we could play between the lines and with Cristiano (Ronaldo) up front we still had an attacking threat,\" he said. \"We brought balance to the team and maintained our scoring ability.\"\nThe draw meant Real missed a chance to go top and they are second on 15 points after seven games, level with champions Barcelona and Celta Vigo and two points ahead of fifth-placed Atletico.\nVillarreal are the surprise leaders on 16 points despite a 1-0 reverse at Levante on Sunday.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:25:51.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
