(Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times) 0 of 0 Servais was introduced as the Mariners’ new manager at a press conference on Monday morning. He becomes another in a growing list of former big-league catchers who have gone on to become Major League Baseball managers. By Stefanie Loh Seattle Times staff reporter \nHe’s big on youth and collaboration, has hopped on the movement to harness advanced statistics in baseball scouting, and is eager to bring about a culture revolution within the Seattle Mariners organization. \nIt’s no wonder that new Mariners manager Scott Servais gets along with his new boss, general manger Jerry Dipoto, whom he’s known since their playing days with the Colorado Rockies in 2000. \nServais was introduced as the Mariners’ new manager at a press conference on Monday morning. \nServais comes to Seattle from Los Angeles, where he spent the last four seasons as the Angels’ assistant general manager of scouting and player development. He becomes another in a growing list of former big-league catchers who have gone on to become Major League Baseball managers. Related Stories They say names can never hurt you, but the Chicago Cubs might disagree \nThis will be Servais’ first stint as a major league manager, but Dipoto said he was not deterred by Servais’ lack of managerial experience, citing the fact that about one-third of the current managers in the big leagues got their jobs with no prior managerial experience. \nAlso, Servais has a broad base of experience. Since his 1988 pro debut in the Houston Astros’ minor league system, Servais has held a variety of positions in baseball. Before his most recent position with the Angels, he’s been a roving catching instructor, a pro scout, and the Texas Rangers’ senior director of player development. \nAll of which, Dipoto said, position him as the ideal candidate for the Mariners’ job. \n“I would actually refute the idea that he hasn’t been a manager at any level,” Dipoto said. “He’s been a manager at every level. Being a manager is about leading people. It’s about creating a collective consciousness in a group, and connecting with those individuals and managing them day-to-day. He has managed people, he has managed players, he has managed situations.” \nIn his opening remarks, Servais thanked the Mariners and his family and everyone who helped him along the way. \n“This opportunity means the world here. I grew up in a town of 500 people. Coming from a small town in western Wisconsin, my parents instilled a blue collar work ethic in me that really drove me to reach my goals,” Servais said. “Not many gave me a shot to play in the big leagues, let along manage in the big leagues. This is a dream come true, and I’ve certainly taken a different path to get here today. \n“I really believe we’ll bring playoff baseball back to the Northwest.” \nServais stressed the need to develop and connect with players. He prides himself on the latter, and said his ability to communicate well with players comes in large part from having played pro ball as a catcher for 15 seasons and knowing what it’s like to be in his players’ shoes – from the baseball strategy and the emotional and mental standpoints. \n“There’s a reason catchers end up in the dugout. Mike Matheny, Brad Ausmus, Mike Scioscia — there’s a long list of catchers in the dugout,” Servais said. “You’re used to dealing with both sides of the ball, with the psyche pitchers have at times. But (you’re) also adapted at understanding the offensive game. Being able to talk to all different players comes from that. \n“There’s a certain thing when you’re talking to a player from a player-to-player level. (It’s) much different than when you’re talking to a player from a farm director, assistant GM level. But the key is to get players to trust you, and it takes time to build trust. And it’ll take time here, too.” \nStill, Servais said he’s confident that he can help build a new culture within his first year. \n“Culture starts from the top, but it grows from the bottom. Everybody that has a Mariners uniform, or that works in this building, is part of establishing the culture. How you come to work every day. If you’re an usher or a ticket taker, if you’re an administrative person upstairs, everybody has to feel like they’re connected and their part of it,” Servais said. \nFrom that standpoint, Servais’ philosophy dovetails nicely with that of Dipoto, who has also stressed building an atmosphere of collaboration. \nAnd it’s not just talk, either. In 2008, when Servais was the senior director of player development with the Texas Rangers’ organization in 2008, he noticed that Nelson Cruz (now a Mariners outfielder, but then part of the Rangers’ Triple-A farm team) was having trouble with his swing. \nSo Servais approached Jon Daniels, then the Rangers’ farm system director, and asked if he could try something different with Cruz. \nDaniels agreed, and Servais “got very involved,” he said. “I asked Nelly if he’d be open to trying some things, and he was. It wasn’t just ‘stand this way,’ it was some other swing-path issues that he needed to address.” \nCruz bought in and worked judiciously with Servais to improve his swing. He made it back to the big leagues. Then, on the night the Rangers won Game 5 of the divisional series at Tampa, Servais was standing in the back of the club house watching the team celebrate when he was engulfed in a Nelson Cruz big bear hug. \n“Thanks,” Cruz told him. “I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you.” \nThat gesture meant the world to Servais. \n“That’s why we connect with players,” Servais said. “That’s why, as a minor league coach, a scout a farm director, that’s why we do the job.” \nThe new Mariners manager also said he wants to visit with the Seahawks to “see how they do some things.” \n“I’m willing to try things,” Servais said. “I’m not about ‘I’ve-got-all-the-answers.’ They’re out there. You’ve just got to keep looking for them.” Stefanie Loh : sloh@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @StefanieLoh .
