The players -- two from Braden River and five from North Port -- are suspended for at least four weeks and will face additional school-based disciplinary measures including community service. \nBoth the Manatee and Sarasota school districts reviewed reports of the incident. A joint report and disciplinary actions will be forwarded to the Florida High School Athletic Association. \n“The confrontation that took place following the game last Friday is unacceptable based on the standards both counties have set for our student athletes,” said Manatee Supervisor of Athletics Jason Montgomery and Sarasota Supervisor of Athletics Bethany D. King. “In addition to disciplinary measures involving our student athletes, this incident has caused both counties to take a close look at how we handle game procedures both home and away to make sure this kind of incident does not occur again.” Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1RwFrov TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:49:50.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
