Then, with less than six minutes to play in the third quarter, transformers blew behind each goalpost, causing utter darkness at Borden Stadium.\nThe Bulldogs, ranked sixth in the Asbury Park Press Top 10, were leading 28-0 when the game was suspended. In the immediate aftermath, no decision was made as to whether or not the game would be picked up at a later date. If the game does not continue, it is still an official result.\nRumson was dominant on the ground, led by 124 yards and two touchdown runs from sophomore running back Matt Vecchiarelli .\nJunior quarterback Mike O’Connor added 67 yards and a touchdown run as the Bulldogs totaled 221 rushing yards through two-and-a-half quarters.", "external_links": ["http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3531258/mike-oconnor", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3887429/matt-vecchiarelli"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:09:22.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
