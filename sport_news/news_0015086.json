On our side, I was able to solidify our ratio a little bit more.”\nMessam, 30, burst onto the CFL scene in ’11 with the Edmonton Eskimos, running for 1,057 yards and six touchdowns.\nBut the 6-foot-3, 245-pounder with the punishing running style then bounced from the Esks to the Alouettes to the Riders over the next two seasons, failing to match his breakout campaign.\nThis season, however, Messam has enjoyed a career resurgence, rumbling for 826 rushing yards — second in the CFL — and adding a career-high 47 receptions.\n“We’re receiving a player that is a very good football player, so I’m excited about that,” Hufnagel said. “Jerome is very excited about relocating to Calgary, and we’ll see what the future holds.\n“Jerome is a free agent after this season, so I realize that, but I’ll have a great opportunity to evaluate things over the course of this season and get a good read on things for off-season planning.”\nMessam, a Toronto native, was at the Blue Jays American League Division Series win over the Texas Rangers at Rogers Centre when the deal went down, taking the time to post a picture to Instagram with the caption, ‘Just gonna enjoy the game and deal with life when it’s over.”\nCornish ran for 72 yards on 12 carries in the 15-11 loss to the Edmonton Eskimos over the weekend, taking a big hit from linebacker Dexter McCoil near the sideline in the second half.\nWhile Cornish popped right back up and looked no worse for wear at the time, he felt that the hit was of the helmet-to-helmet variety when he met with the media.\nHufnagel wasn’t ready to link the McCoil hit to Cornish’s neck problem.\n“I’m not quite sure what hit caused it,” Hufnagel said. “He got hit a few times during the game.”\nSince returning from a broken thumb that caused him to miss six games, Cornish has run for 297 yards on 54 carries for an average of 5.5 yards per carry.\nWith Cornish and Messam now in the fold — along with Canadian tailback Matt Walter, who has struggled to make it onto the active roster in recent weeks — Hufnagel feels the backfield is set no matter the circumstances.\n“There’s no question they’re both very, very good football players, and the more good football players you have on your football team, it’s a good situation,” Hufnagel added. “I don’t see any downside.”\nJON CORNISH\nYear Carries Yards Avg.
