Montgomery, who then shot himself.\nThe Griffins’ daughter was 12 years old at the time of the shooting. Friends of hers planted the tree in the Longmont neighborhood of Prospect, where the family lived.\nProspect developer Kiki Wallace says a nearby bench clearly marks the tree as a memorial.\nLongmont police Cmdr. Jeff Satur said neither the city of Longmont nor the property owners claim responsibility for the felled tree.\n___\nInformation from: Daily Camera, http://www.dailycamera.com/", "external_links": ["http://www.dailycamera.com/", "http://bit.ly/1jtJ8jB)"], "published": "2015-10-17T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:24:45.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
