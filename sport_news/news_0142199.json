Clay said. “This is our big game. I was joking with our guys and telling them ESPN Gameday is going to be there.” \nTonight’s game is a show- down between two of the three remaining unbeaten teams in 1-AAA, with Trinity also looking to stay perfect in a trip to Holy Spirit in Atlanta. \nRegardless of the outcomes of the two games, that list is guaranteed to drop by at least one tonight, where the loser between Heritage and Logan- ville no longer holds its destiny in its own hands. \nThe good news for the Hawks is an up-and-down season has finally leveled off somewhat. Following three consecutive non-region losses, Heritage has outscored its first two region opponents by a combined score of 114-21. \n“We are starting to get things rolling, we are getting everybody back,” Clay said. “We have had a couple of games where everything is clicking.” \nHeritage, however, doesn’t expect to put up 50-plus points on a third consecutive region opponent. Loganville’s defense had allowed just 14 in its five games, capped off by region victories over Holy Spirit (34-0) and Dominion Christian (42-6) the past two weeks. \nThe Lions have also averaged 41.2 points on offense this season. \nThis is the only the second meeting between the two teams, with the Hawks winning 54-27 last year. \nLike the Hawks, the Lions had plenty of experience returning heading into the 2015 season. \nSenior quarterback Donovan Taitt has yet to throw an interception through five games, going 47 of 70 passing for 658 yards and 10 touchdowns. Five receivers — four of which are also seniors — have at least five receptions this year. \nBoth lineups tonight will showcase talented ends. Loganville senior Mike Meme leads the Lions offense with 12 receptions for 164 yards to go with three touchdowns. The 6-0, 180-pound defensive end also has posted six sacks. \nFor Heritage, senior Cole Jones leads the Hawks with 15 receptions for 282 yards and two touchdowns. Last week, the 6-3, 190-pound three- sport standout also returned an interception from midfield for a score while also leading Heritage’s defense with 27 tackles. \nAlong with Meme, Loganville expects to challenge the Hawks’ veteran secondary with seniors Collin Hall (9 rec., 113 yds), Cole Cook (9 rec., 168 yds) and Gaines Roberts (7 rec., 106 yds). \nIf that wasn’t enough for Heritage defenders to keep an eye on, the Lions’ offense also boasts talented two-way starter John Heart. Loganville is averaging over 250 yards rushing per game. \nThe 5-10, 180-pound senior running back has yet to be held under 100-yards rushing in a single game, enter- ing tonight with 766 yards and 11 touchdowns. He had a season-high 243-yard effort with three touchdowns in the region opener against Holy Spirit. \nHeart is also a top defensive back with eight tackles, a caused fumble and two fumble recoveries. Taitt also plays in the secondary and leads Loganville with two of its five interceptions so far this year. Junior linebacker Matt Hardeman leads Loganville with 24 tackles. A front line of Meme and fellow seniors Caleb Burgess and Drake Cunningham have combined for 13 sacks through five games.
