The onus there is not so much on Greinke as it is on the Dodgers’ offense. Thirty of Greinke’s 32 starts during the regular season were quality and he completed six innings in all 32. Despite that and his 1.66 ERA on the season, L.A. managed to lose eight games Greinke started due to poor run support. They haven’t lost a Greinke start in which they have scored four or more runs all season and haven’t lost one in which they have scored three or more runs since the second day of the regular season.\nMLB Mets’ deGrom outduels Kershaw in Game 1 to leave Dodgers in tough spot by Ben Reiter", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/cliffcorcoran"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:37:25.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
