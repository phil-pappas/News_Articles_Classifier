Boston Swaisgood connected with Tyler Grine for a 27-yard touchdown. Clay then threw an interception on the first play of the ensuing possession. On Ross’ first play Swaisgood and Grine hooked up again as Grine made a terrific run after the catch for a 65-yard touchdown. \nROSS HIGHLIGHTS \nA Jarren Hampton interception midway through the second quarter set up Ross’ first touchdown. On fourth-and-6 from the Clay 35-yard line, Swaisgood eluded pressure and extended the play long enough for Uriah Haun to slip coverage. Swaisgood found Haun over the middle who scampered the rest of the way, aided by a nice block by Dayvon Atkins, for the touchdown. Clay trimmed the Little Giants’ lead to 21-14 midway through the fourth quarter, but Haun put the game away with a 22-yard touchdown run with 3:16 to go.
