Van Persie joined the Turkish club from Manchester United in the summer, but has starred in just six of his 12 appearances for the club thus far in the 2015-16 season. The 32-year-old remains integral to the Dutch squad, and Blind said that he is keen to see the forward become a regular part of the club’s starting XI. “For van Persie and for us this is not the most ideal situation . You want your players to play,” Blind was quoted as saying by goal.com on Monday. “On Thursday he played an entire game against Celtic, but it’s not a good situation when one of your main players is not in the starting line-up weekly,” he said. Blind, who succeeded Guus Hiddink at the helm in July, has endured a tough time as Netherlands boss with the nation on the brink of missing out on Euro 2016 after taking just 10 points from their eight qualifiers in Group A.
