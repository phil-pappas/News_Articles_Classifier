Minnesota had a season-high seven sacks, which also was a season worst for Detroit. \nVikings rookie Stefon Diggs had six receptions for 108 yards, including a go-ahead, 36-yard score on which he leaped from just inside the 5 and landed in the end zone in the third quarter. \nPeterson had a season-long 75-yard run on the Vikings’ next drive, but they stalled and settled for one of Blair Walsh’s five field goals. \nThe Lions had a chance to make the final minutes potentially dramatic, but they turned the ball over on downs at the Vikings 1. \nMinnesota had punter Jeff Locke run out of the end zone on the ensuing possession, taking a safety to stay two scores ahead with a 28-19 lead with 59 seconds left. \nDetroit drove to the Vikings 36 on its final drive before turning the ball over on downs again, and getting booed by the sparse crowd that was still in Ford Field. \nMinnesota had not won a division road game since winning in Detroit on Sept. 30, 2012. \nBridgewater had his best passer rating of the season in last month’s 26-16 win against the Lions, and nearly matched it in the rematch. \nBridgewater was 25 of 35 and finished 2 yards short of setting a career high for yards passing. The first of his two TD passes was a 1-yard toss to Kyle Rudolph that got Minnesota within five late in the second quarter. Blair’s 51-yard field goal ended the first half and cut Detroit’s lead to 17-15. \nPeterson, who had a season-high 135 yards in his last game against Detroit, was shut down for much of the day, but he helped the Vikings to 140 yards on the ground, compared to 77 for the Lions. \nStafford, meanwhile, didn’t have much time to set up in the pocket after a strong start. \nHe capped the opening 75-yard drive with a 1-yard TD pass to Calvin Johnson. He connected with Eric Ebron on a 7-yard scoring pass to end an 80-yard drive on his next possession. \nThe rest of the game, he was getting sacked, hit and hurried. Stafford finished 18 of 26 for 256 yards with the two TDs. © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:37:45.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
