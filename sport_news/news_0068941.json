Posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 11:08 pm Bears pull away from Arabians 42-21 By Rick Teverbaugh | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 16, 2015 by Rick Teverbaugh \nPENDLETON â€” It was all going so well early in the second quarter. \nPendleton Heights was in position to go ahead of visiting Shelbyville, but a couple of key plays changed the momentum of the contest and helped the Golden Bears to a 42-21 win Friday night. \nThe Arabians marched from their own 45 to the visitors' 5 yard line and had first down there. But the next two plays lost two yards. On third down PH quarterback Jarrod Hubble launched a pass into the corner of the end zone under heavy rush but no receivers were in the general vicinity. \nThe officials called Hubble for intentional grounding. The penalty and the loss of down pushed kicker Thomas Quiroga just out of comfortable field goal range and his attempt was wide left from 33 yards out. \n\"I got on the kids at halftime,\" said PH coach John Broughton. \"We've got the ball first-and-goal in the first half with the score tied 7-7, we've got to get the ball in the end zone. We didn't block hard enough. We ended up trying a 30-yard field goal at the end of that fiasco.\" \nThe Golden Bears took over on their own 20 and on the second play De'Shaun French broke through a hole in the right side and stepped down the sidelines for a 79-yard TD run and a 14-7 lead. \nPendleton drove the ball back down against once-beaten Shelbyville and got as far as the 23 of the Bears but ran out of time. Quiroga's 40-yard attempt was short as time expired in the first half. \nThings got a bit more desperate early in the second half. \nShelbyville's Sam Lewis took a short kickoff from PH to open the half and rambled nearly 60 yards and the Golden Bears set up shot at the PH 16. On the very next play, John Lux, the Shelbyville quarterback, tucked the ball in and cut around left end for a TD run. \n\"We talked at halftime about kicking off and holding them to get good field position, but that all went out the window,\" said Broughton. \nThat made the score 20-7 just 21 seconds after halftime. After a blocked punt by the visitors' Jarrett Mohr set up their next drive, Lux hit Justin Sueko on a 30-yard pass for a 28-7 lead just four minutes into the half. \nThe Arabians battled back and closed out the third quarter with a touchdown pass from Hubble to Garett Byars covering 8 yards to make the score 28-14. \nBut the PH defense could not often stop the Bears' offense in the second half. Stopping French was a load for the Arabians to defend. He rushed for 183 yards in just 15 carries. \nPendleton's other scores came on a 14-yard pass from Hubble to Ben Avey and on a 36-yard run by Logan Drye. Chase Cochran rushed 24 times for 80 yards. \nHubble completed 13 of 19 passes for 215 yards. Jordan Kirkpatrick caught four passes for 51 yards. \"When we have to throw the ball that many times we're not going to win every often,\" said Broughton. \"We're just not that consistent sometimes.\" \nThe Arabians go on the road next Friday to open sectional play at Connersville.
