Filed:   10:48   10:48 UK \nAston Villa manager Tim Sherwood has backed the club to get through their current poor run of form, despite reports suggesting that he may only have two games to save his job. \nVilla's recent record of just one point from seven league games has left the club four points adrift from safety and Sherwood facing questions regarding his future in the West Midlands. \nHowever, ahead of their fixture with Chelsea on Saturday afternoon, Sherwood has insisted that both himself and the club will benefit from their troubled spell. \nThe 46-year-old told reporters: \"Once I get through this period everyone will benefit. Aston Villa will and Tim Sherwood will. I'm a football manager and am responsible for results. That's what I'm paid for. I'll stand up to this. \n\"I take a lot of heart from managers who have been through difficult periods. This is my first tough period in management. We'll soldier on and get through it. I have 100% belief that we'll stay in the Premier League.\" \nSherwood has won 10 of his 26 games in charge of Villa since being appointed in February.
