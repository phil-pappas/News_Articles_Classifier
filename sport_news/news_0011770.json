Their great young team enters the National League Championship Series, and now, our Cubs fan brothers and sisters are on a thrilling adventure.\nSome sports commentators tell Cubs Nation to put away all their old painful history and curses, and live for the moment. But that ignores human nature. And other busybodies, with the parched souls of bureaucrats, are coming up with rules about how Cubs fans should behave in the days ahead, as if fan behavior can ever alter a game.\nCome on.\nI see Cubs fans as brave souls, like astonished space travelers landing on some strange other world, exactly as depicted on the covers of old pulp sci-fi magazines.\nThey take tiny steps at first, wide-eyed and amazed, stepping off onto that unknown planet, and you can't help feel for the brave creatures.\nIt just so happens I found the cover of Other Worlds Science Stories, the May 1950 edition, featuring a story called \"Dear Devil,\" which I will never read.\nBut it's the pulpy illustration of \"Dear Devil\" that gets me.\nIs the Year of the Goat also the year of the Cubs? Tony Briscoe For curse-fearing Cubs fans, not all associations with goats are bad.\nNo history lesson is needed to know that a goat has been pegged as the downfall of the team since 1945 when Billy Goat Tavern owner Billy Sianis cursed the team after he and his pet goat were booted from a World Series game against...\nFor curse-fearing Cubs fans, not all associations with goats are bad.\nNo history lesson is needed to know that a goat has been pegged as the downfall of the team since 1945 when Billy Goat Tavern owner Billy Sianis cursed the team after he and his pet goat were booted from a World Series game against...\n(Tony Briscoe) It shows a leathery alien with Cubbie-blue skin, and horns and big, green bug eyes, tenderly holding a sleeping human child who may or may not be a Cubs fan, but probably was a Cubs fan in another universe.\nAnd that's just how I feel, my Cubs fans friends: Like your special protective and nurturing alien friend with the bug eyes and horns, gently wishing you good fortune and easy dreams on this wonderful journey of yours through the NLCS.\n\"What an amazing adventure!!\" said Laura Lyman Starr on Facebook. \"What dreams are made of!\"\nExactly Laura, but some Cubs fans are understandably nervous. And though they have a great young team that will only improve, a few are skittish, like some horses.\nSo friends, how can we non-Cubsians help?\nHow should those of us who are not Cubs fans approach you people? We won't put blankets over your heads and pet you and give you carrots, but should we use a soothing voice?\nOr perhaps offer Reese's Pieces, like the little boy Elliott in \"E.T.\" in the hopes of making a strange new friend?\nCubs' young players smash expectations Patrick M. O&apos;Connell To see Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler up close as they amble into the media interview room underneath the Wrigley Field grandstand, instead of squinting from the bleachers or from home on television, it's clear: These guys are kids.\nMuscular, tall, athletic home-run-crushing kids....\nTo see Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler up close as they amble into the media interview room underneath the Wrigley Field grandstand, instead of squinting from the bleachers or from home on television, it's clear: These guys are kids.\nMuscular, tall, athletic home-run-crushing kids....\n(Patrick M. O&apos;Connell) Or should we just shut up and say nothing and not even acknowledge the great Cubs games to come?\n\"I think if you just can it, that would be good, that's a good idea for Sox fans: Just can it,\" said my friend and Cubs fan Jaimie Zeman, the kindly heating and air conditioning guy who was fixing our hot water heater at home a few feet from me as I was writing this.\n\"Just stay here in your basement it until it's over,\" Zeman told me, and since I need hot water, I didn't argue. \"That's probably the best thing. And maybe can it too.\"\nThe trouble is that non-Cubs fans like me can't sit in our basements for days. If we do, we'll start drinking and become unruly.\nSo how do we greet Cubs fans?\n\"With piping hot bowls of goat soup and goat brat sanguiches,\" said Peter Bella, cynical ex-cop and marvelous cook. \"Being obsequious and servile is a plus. Let the goat in.\"\nGood idea about the soup and sanguiches, but obsequious and servile will not work. In their agitated state, Cubs fans might take offense.\n\"Step one,\" wrote Sean P. Dawson. \"Have Sox fans keep their sarcasm to themselves.\"\nThat's what I'm saying, too, Sean. There's no room for it when people's nerves are persnickety on the eve of a big series.\n\"Just stay away and go be with the other SUX (sic) FANS at McNally's Bar,\" said Cubs fan Tim Kovacik referencing the famed South Side tavern that serves you up free beer if a Cubs opponent hits a home run.\n\"Don't remind of us Bartman, the Goat or Steve Garvey and we will be good,\" said Cubs fan Trey Hancock.\nI didn't mention anything, you did.\n\"Join us in celebrating the beauty of this year and that a ChiTown team is moving on,\" said Tony Lazzari. \"Or if you are a true ChiSox fan, go back to your corner, mumble into your flat beer with a mouth full of sausage and keep reminding everyone who will listen \"But we won it all in 95.\"\nThat was 2005. And since, the Sox have had difficulties while the Cubs now play baseball the way it's supposed to be played.\nClearly, I needed to know more about Cubs fans types, so my colleague \"Old School,\" a Cubs fan, broke the fans down into groups so I might study them.\nThe South Side Cubs fan . \"Myself included,\" said Old School. \"We're often treated with suspicion or scorn.\"\nThe Laissez Faire Cubs Fans . These, Old School says, treat Wrigley Field like a beach, wearing flip flops to the ballpark.\nAnd Fair-weather Cubs Fans , and Rowdy Cubs fans , \"Who will throw hands if drunk enough (spoiler alert: they are),\" said Old School.\nAnd don't forget Lifelong Cubs Fans who live and die with the team.\nAmazingly, the same types of fans exist on the South Side. Can it be that we're all human? Or we're all aliens?\n\"Take it easy!\" said Janis Trinchere. \"Can't we all just get along?\"\nExactly, Janis.\nPlay ball.\njskass@tribpub.com\nTwitter @John_Kass\n Chicago Cubs Chicago White Sox National League Championship Series Commentary Opinion Steve Garvey", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56201429/turbine/ct-cubs-youth-attitude-met-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56203de6/turbine/ct-cubs-year-of-the-goat-met-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56206d22/turbine/ct-cubs-alien-world-kass-met-1016-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:31:37.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
