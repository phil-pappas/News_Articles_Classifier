The Bears put their passive past to rest in a 3-0 Big Sky Conference victory over North Dakota at Bank of Colorado Arena in front of 1,236 fans. UNC evened its BSC record a 4-4 and improved to 8-13 overall. UND is 4-4, 16-9. “I thought it was a good match for us. I thought we put together a complete match without lapses, which we haven’t done yet this conference season,” UNC coach Lyndsey Oates said in a news release. “Unlike other matches we took a step forward not getting passive, when our opponent did and stayed aggressive throughout the match.” UNC out-hit (.327-.146), out-dug (52-36) and out-blocked (7-3) UND in the match, and never trailed in the first two sets. The Bears had two players finish with double digit kills — Kendra Cunningham (17) and Alex Kloehn (11) — to go along with four players who hit above .300, led by Cunningham at .500. “They have good middles who are big and strong blockers so on the pin it is easier to tool, and Ashley (Guthrie) did a great job of pushing me out and see the block develop,” Cunningham said about the team’s offensive output. Oates also was pleased with her team’s ability to attack UND’s strength. “North Dakota has two very good middles, but we didn’t try to go away from them,” Oates said. “With Kendra scoring so well tonight we just kept feeding her and she was making some very good decisions hitting high and staying aggressive. I thought she scored well because our middles in Alex (Kloehn) and Emily (O’Neil) were scoring, making us more balanced.” UNC’s offense centered around junior setter Ashley Guthrie, who had 47 assists, five digs, three blocks and an ace serve. “I think we had a really good game plan coming into tonight,” Guthrie said. “I was able to see their middle blockers well at times, but when Kendra is hitting the way she was tonight it opens it up for everyone else. Alex and Emily had great games as well.” The Bears also received solid performances from O’Neil (7 kills, 3 blocks) and freshman Kortney Lockey (5 kills). “Kortney continues to really develop for us,” Oates said. “She had a great game against Sac State and continued that development tonight. She didn’t have as many attempts tonight, but still played really well and continues to show improvement in every match.” The Bears will now go on the road for matches this week at Southern Utah and Northern Arizona. “Today was a big step for us on moving forward as a team,” Oates said. “We took a step backwards on Thursday, but took a step forward today. We have to now take a mentality of ‘so what’. Southern Utah isn’t going to care that we just swept North Dakota and we need to continue to work on getting one percent better each and every day.” UND 16 16 19 UNC 25 25 25 UND — Kills: Chelsea Moser 9, Faith Dooley 9, Kristen Giesbrecht 5, Julia Spacek 4.
