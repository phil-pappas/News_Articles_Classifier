It's virtually impossible, history has told us, but not 100 percent thanks to a group of famously self-dubbed Idiots. \nAnd there are some similarities here, if you want to grasp at straws, Cubs fans. \nAs everyone reading this likely already knows, the only team to come back from a 3-0 postseason deficit to win a series was the 2004 Boston Red Sox, and they were down in the bottom of the ninth of Game 4 against the Yankees. \nWhat are the similarities? Well, the Red Sox were supposedly cursed (no, there aren't curses and believing as such is pretty simple-minded) by the sale of Babe Ruth. Their top front-office executive was general manager Theo Epstein. \nThe Cubs are supposedly cursed by a goat (even though that didn't happen until 1945, when the Cubs hadn't won the World Series since 1908) and are led by club president Theo Epstein. \nMuch like those '04 Red Sox, the Cubs were a wild-card team with a lot of regular-season wins. The Red Sox just had fewer than their division-rival Yankees, much like the 97-win Cubs had fewer than their top rival Cardinals (and Pirates, of course). Both lineups were packed with power, too, though the Cubs' is younger. \nAnd I would submit, that much like those 2004 Red Sox, these Cubs have the type of mindset needed to overcome such long odds. They have such confidence in themselves and have managed to stay loose throughout, no matter how much adversity they face. The Red Sox had the \"idiots\" thing while the Cubs have on several occasions said they have enough young players that they are just dumb enough to think they can keep winning. \nThe odds say they are pretty dumb to believe they can rip off four straight right now, especially with how well the Mets are playing and with the stellar starting pitching they are running out there. \nYes, they are still dumb enough to believe it can happen, too. \n\"It's gonna happen twice,\" catcher Miguel Montero said when a reporter mentioned that it had happened once before. \n\"We're not in a good spot, obviously, we all know that,\" Montero said. \"We just gotta come back tomorrow and grind it out. We can't sit back and feel sorry for ourselves.\" \n\"We've done it all year and we gotta do it again.\" \nThat was the message the Cubs kept sending in the locker room after the game. A locker room that -- though far from jovial, obviously -- didn't seem defeated or ready to embrace any doom-and-gloom scenario. \n\"It is a daunting task, but we've bounced back from losses and put together long winning streaks before,\" Game 3 starter Kyle Hendricks said. \n\"This team's done some special things this season, so we don't count ourselves out by any means,\" Kyle Schwarber said. \n\"We've lost three games in a row before and come back to start winning streaks. Hopefully we do it again,\" Montero noted. \nIn fact, this is an interesting tidbit: The Cubs had lost five straight in late June before going into New York and sweeping the Mets. Not quite as interesting since it wasn't the Mets, but the Cubs lost three straight in mid-August only to turn around and rip off six straight wins. They lost three straight in mid-September and followed with five straight wins (against the Pirates and Cardinals, mind you). They lost three straight in late September and followed with eight straight wins to close the regular season and the wild-card victory. \nSo, yes, the Cubs have turned things around after three straight losses several times this season. They haven't had to do it with zero margin for error in the postseason, of course, and that's a whole different ballgame. \nA ballgame that hitting instructor Manny Ramirez has played before and won with those 2004 Red Sox. \n\"I hope so!\" Montero exclaimed when asked if the Cubs should draw on Manny Being Manny's wisdom from the experience. \nWouldn't it be fitting, though? The Cubs were expected to be a fringe contender in the mid-80s in wins. They started four rookies for a large part of the last two months. They only had two reliable starting pitchers in the final two months. They had a motley-crew bullpen of castoffs . \nAdd all that up and the Cubs still won 97 games, beat the 98-win Pirates in the NL wild-card game and the 100-win Cardinals 3-1 in the NLDS. \nThis shouldn't all add up like that, just as it shouldn't add up to a comeback in the NLCS. So maybe it does. Baseball is unpredictable, after all. \n\"Baseball is a crazy game,\" Schwarber said. \"We're gonna keep battling to the end. It's happened before, so we're really looking forward to getting back out to the ballpark tomorrow.\" \nIf they are dumb enough to believe it and talented enough to get it done, how crazy would it be that it was Epstein's Red Sox and Epstein's Cubs to pull it off? \nI would say \"stranger things have happened,\" but I don't think that's true. It would be the strangest of the strange. \nJustin Grimm and the Cubs are on the verge of elimination.
