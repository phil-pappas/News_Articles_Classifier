Both teams rank in the top 7 in the league in average yards per game. But that does not tell the whole story about the starts these two teams have had. The Falcons are one of the surprises of the season, starting 5-0, thanks in part to running back Devonta Freeman. The Miami Central and Florida State grad ranks second in the NFL with 405 rushing yards, and first with 8 rushing touchdowns. Matt Ryan is third in the NFL in passing yards, behind only Philip Rivers and Andy Dalton, thanks in large part to one of the most dangerous receivers in the league, Julio Jones.The Saints are in an entirely different boat - 1-4 to start the year, including a home loss to Tampa. New Orleans has been solid offensively even with a banged up Drew Brees, but defensively they rank dead last in yards allowed. The Saints chances of winning the NFC South might be over all ready. But they certainly will be entirely kaput if they lose Thursday night. It also might be another sign that Sean Payton will be available to the highest bidder at the end of the season.
