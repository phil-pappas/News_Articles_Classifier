Gordon Hayward injury \nJazz star swingman Gordon Hayward was held out of Friday's open practice with a lower back contusion — the result of the flagrant foul by C.J. McCollum during Monday's preseason game. \nThat was a little bit of a surprise because Hayward has practiced over the last week since the injury. But Utah Jazz head coach Quin Snyder explained that Hayward was trying to tough it out, but he clearly wasn't moving at his usual level of practice intensity. \n\"He's fine, but he is sore,\" Snyder said. \"When we start the season, I want the team to be not just healthy, but good legs and fresh. I don't think we're that right now.\" \nDerrick Favors didn't play during large stretches of the Jazz's scrimmage Friday for the same reason. The Jazz felt it best to save his body the beating. \nThe Jazz won't practice Saturday. They'll rest up for Sunday's preseason game in Portland. I wouldn't be surprised if a number of guys sit out. Some practice takeaways \nThe Jazz really did practice Friday night, almost a culmination of the second training camp the team has underwent this week. It was a cool opportunity for the approximately 2,100 in attendance to see what the Jazz really do during practice. That includes media members, who are limited to seeing just the final 15 minutes of every NBA practice. \nHere were some of my takeaways from the action: \nThe Jazz ran through a lot of 5-on-0, learning plays and new options within those plays. As Snyder pointed out, if the team makes mistakes during 5-on-0 in execution, it can't be a good sign when the team plays with a defense trying to stop them. They used an interesting keepaway-type drill with three players in a triangle and two players trying to steal the ball. That's one that I've seen a lot in my soccer experience, but it's useful for basketball players too, so they are able to anticipate on defense and make quick passes on offense. During water breaks, half of the team gets water, while the other half shoots competitively. Then, they reverse groups, just so there's no down time for during the mandated time allowed. Also interesting, Jazz strength and conditioning coach Isaiah Wright was measuring each player's water intake during the drill. That's an impressive level of detail. The Jazz had a lot of problems in late shot clock situations last year. Instead of just yelling a \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1\" countdown as in season past, the Jazz will yell \"Ice\" with seven seconds remaining on the shot clock. That should give them enough time to set one final pick and roll up and hopefully get a better shot. We'll be watching. Snyder talked about how he wants his team to defend while in imbalanced fastbreak situations — by fouling. He wants his team to foul up top before the offense gets into a shooting area. That will give time for the rest of the team to come back to the ball on the inbounds pass. This, by the way, is exceptionally boring, and I wish the NBA would prohibit intentional fouls in order to prevent these fastbreaks from being so easily foiled. According to Snyder, the Jazz will have about 50-100 plays in the playbook, \"at least,\" over the course of a season. He wouldn't say how many they've implemented so far, other to say that it wasn't that many. Snyder's impressions on Friday's practice: \"I thought we played pretty good offense. The ball was really moving, and we've spent some time working on some of those things, just timing and being connected and running plays, and playing out of our offense.\" 0 Pending", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:05:57.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
