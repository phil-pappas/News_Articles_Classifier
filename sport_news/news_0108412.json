Armstrong initially made a \"joint decision\" with his girlfriend to have her lie to police about the accident by saying she was behind the wheel instead of him. Oscar Pistorius has been released from prison into house arrest \nThe government tried to ask him about this during Armstrong's pretrial deposition testimony last month, but his attorney objected and wouldn't let him answer. So now the government wants a judge to order it. \n\"The events surrounding Armstrong's decision to suborn false statements to the Aspen Police undermine his claim that his propensity for deception was limited in time to the period before his doping was exposed,\" the government said in court documents filed Monday. \nThe request is part of the government's $100 million civil fraud lawsuit against Armstrong on behalf of the U.S. Postal Service, which paid more than $30 million to sponsor Armstrong's cycling team from 1998-2004. The government argues Armstrong violated his team's sponsorship contract by doping and then concealed those violations for years in order to avoid paying the money back. Under the False Claims Act, damages could be tripled to nearly $100 million. \n\"His credibility is a central issue,\" the government stated in court documents Monday. \nThe case has been mired in disputes about pretrial evidence and recently included a second day of deposition testimony from Armstrong in San Francisco. A transcribed portion of that testimony was revealed in court documents Monday. Lindsey Vonn heading to Austria but hasn't decided on season opener \nIn the deposition on Sept. 24, government attorney David Finkelstein asked him what changed from the days when he'd say or do anything without regard for the consequences. Armstrong replied that we \"all crossed that line\" when it came to doping in cycling and lying about it. \n\"I was, unfortunately, asked that question much more than anybody else, so, therefore, I lied about it a lot more than anybody else,\" Armstrong testified, according to the transcript. \"I felt an obligation to protect the team and my foundation and the sport of cycling and my family, etc., etc ., etc. \n\"But … to take those steps and actions even farther, to -- you know , to criticize people, to call people liars, to attack people, quote, unquote , was - - was totally dishonorable. And - - and I think, as I told you guys in Denver , I - - I have done everything I can do to make it right with those people, and that means traveling the world and sitting with them and meeting with them and apologizing to them.\" \n\"Has everyone forgiven you?\" Finkelstein asked. \n\"I'm not batting a thousand there, but it doesn't mean I haven't tried,\" Armstrong replied. \nFinkelstein also asked Armstrong, 44, if he thinks he owes an apology to former teammate Frankie Andreu. \n“Well, I have apologized to Frankie,” Armstrong replied. “Frankie was the first person that I apologized to. But what I said on Twitter was true. We know that to be true. I didn't - - I didn't - - at this point in time, there's no more lies here. That what I said on there, if I -- if I said that Frankie doped for the majority of his career, that -- that is absolutely the truth.” \nAndreu disputed this Monday to USA TODAY Sports, saying he raced for a long time \"completely clean.\" In 2006, he admitted to a limited amount of doping but says Armstrong now is trying to smear him \"because of everything that has happened.\" Ten years ago, Andreu and his wife Betsy testified in a different case that they overheard Armstrong admit to doping in 1996. But Armstrong denied doping for years and attacked those who questioned him, including the Andreus. \nArmstrong finally admitted to doping in a televised interview with Oprah Winfrey in January 2013. He has been stripped of all seven of his titles in the Tour de France and since has reached undisclosed settlements to end at least three other fraud lawsuits against him that sought the return of millions. \nAfter his confession, Armstrong told a newspaper reporter in 2013 that he believed that some of the lawsuits filed against him “have merit.” \nThe government asked him about this comment during his recent deposition, wanting to find out which ones he believed had merit. But Armstrong’s attorney, Sharif Jacob, wouldn’t permit him to answer, saying it was confidential under attorney-client privilege. \nOn Monday, the government also asked the judge to order Armstrong to answer these questions, too. \n“Even if some part of Armstrong’s understanding of this statement was formed based on communications with his attorneys, he waived any claim of privilege when he revealed the substance of those communications to the news media,” the government argued Monday. \nArmstrong’s attorneys say the government’s case against him is without merit because the Postal Service was not damaged by his doping and instead profited from the positive publicity it received then from Armstrong’s success. \nFollow sports reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer .
