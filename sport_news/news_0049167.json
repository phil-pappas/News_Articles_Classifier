It’s just another game to us. They are kind of treating it like their Super Bowl. But we are approaching it just like we approach every game.’’\nIndeed, many around the NFL would be eager to stamp the Bengals as Super Bowl contenders if they can beat the Seahawks and improve to 5-0 for the third time in franchise history.\nThe 2-2 Seahawks, though, also have some proving to do.\nFirst will be showing if they can win a game on the road without running back Marshawn Lynch.\nThe 29-year-old will miss his second consecutive game because of a hamstring injury, again throwing the tailback duties onto Thomas Rawls and Fred Jackson. That’s assuming Jackson is able to play with a high-ankle sprain suffered Monday.\nThough shaky pass protection and their six sacks allowed got much of the attention after the 13-10 victory over Detroit, the Seahawks were held to a season low in rushing yards (110) and rushing yards per attempt (3.5) in the game.\nHaving another week to prepare for the possibility of a game without Lynch might compel the Seahawks to lean a bit more on their passing attack, especially going against a Bengals defense that has allowed 279 passing yards per game, sixth-most in the NFL.\nHigh on the to-do list Sunday, though, might be proving that the Seattle defense again is the best in the NFL.\nThe Seahawks allowed the fewest points in the NFL the past three seasons and again have played to that level the past two games following the return of strong safety Kam Chancellor from his holdout. After allowing 61 points in the first two games of the season the Seahawks have allowed just 10 the past two — seven coming on a fumble return.\nChicago and Detroit, Seattle’s past two opponents, had 18 punts, a fumble and a field goal in 20 possessions.\nDefensive coordinator Kris Richard said the improvement was more than just having Chancellor back but added, “There’s no doubt about it. Everybody’s willing to admit, we all know the type of player that he is, the presence and impact that he has for our football team. It’s outstanding.”\nThe combined 1-7 record of the Bears and Lions also has to be considered.\nThere will be no asterisk this week, as the Bengals come in averaging 422 yards per game, second in the NFL, and 294 passing, which ranks fourth. The Bengals have had particular success throwing down field, averaging an NFL-high 10.2 yards per attempt — the Chargers are next at 9.0.\nSeahawks coaches and players, though, noted that their defense is designed to take away big plays — since Chancellor has returned the Seahawks are allowing just 4.8 yards per pass compared with 7.25 for the season.\n“What they do best is what we emphasize,’’ Richard said. “It’s staying on top and eliminating explosive plays, and they’re the most explosive offense in the NFL right now, so it will certainly be a great challenge.”\nSeahawks players specifically mentioned the success Cincinnati has had with seam routes — essentially, the mid-range routes run between linebackers and safeties.\nChancellor, for instance, took the blame for what turned out to be Detroit’s longest completion on a seam route on the final drive Monday, a 26-yarder that set the stage for his hit and forced fumble a few plays later of Calvin Johnson that decided the outcome of the game.\n“They just try to find that hole in the defense, and (quarterback Andy Dalton) does a good job of recognizing where the holes are,’’ Wagner said. “But we have a very athletic defense, so if we just do our job I don’t expect them to do the same things that they have been doing to other teams.’’\nBob Condotta: 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com .
