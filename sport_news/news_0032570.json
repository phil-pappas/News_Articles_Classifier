The win for Magda was 11 seconds off the school record, set by Adrian Ross. \nSophomore Cole Clever also had a good day, finishing fifth overall with a time of 16:05.40 – good enough to tie former Sherman and Shawnee State All-American Galen Dills on Unioto’s all-time sophomore list. \nAlso scoring for the Shermans was freshman Aaron Laplante (13th, 16:41.90), freshman Tucker Markko (14th, 16:44.40) and freshman Jaden Watkins (23rd, 16:56.70), rounding out the top five. \nThose performances gave Unioto the win as a team as well, with 56 total points and an average finish time of 16:24.68 – setting a new school record, edging the 2010 team who were regional champs. \nSeven other area teams were also in the event: Waverly, Zane Trace, Westfall, Chillicothe, Huntington, Adena and Paint Valley. \nWaverly finished in sixth place with 206 points with Hunter Hoover as its top individual finisher. He was eighth with a time of 16:32.70. The next closest Tiger to Hoover was Brenden Reed, in 30th, with a mark of 17:15.0. \nZane Trace finished in seventh place with 227 points. The Pioneers’ best individual finish came from sophomore Andrew Graves, who came in 16th with a time of 16:48.60. \nAfter Zane Trace was Westfall (9th, 250 points), Chillicothe (13th, 336 points), Huntington (14th, 351 points), Paint Valley (21st, 554 points) and Adena (23rd, 695 points). \nAs good as the Shermans boys were, the girls were even better. Unioto’s top five individual finishers all crossed the finish line as a part of the top 25. \nPer usual, junior Haley Wright led the way with a first place finish. However, this one was different than the others she’s turned in this year. \nWright shattered the school record, held by Kinkela Harkins, by 40 seconds with a time of 18:11.10 — 20 seconds faster than her closest competitor. Her closest competitor happened to be her own teammate in sophomore Alex Evans, who took second with a mark of 18:31.30. \nElena Knipp followed those two with an eight place individual finish at 19:07.50 and was proceeded by freshman Tessa Sylvester, in ninth, at 19:10.60. Rounding out the Tanks’ top five was freshman Abbey Mohan in 23rd with a finish time of 20:19.60, a personal record. \nTo further explain the dominance Unioto put forth Saturday; Amber Butler began the day at second all-time in school history. When the day ended, she was sixth. \nThe Shermans’ mark of 41 points also gave them the team win and kept their unbeaten streak alive in Division II this season. \nZane Trace’s girls also had a good day on the course, coming in third as a team with 154 points. \nScoring for the Pioneers were junior Ivy Beam (17th, 19:55.40), senior Alison Chinn (22nd, 20:16.80), junior McKenzie Ray (35th, 20:58.70), sophomore Hailey Puckett (38th, 21:04.10) and sophomore Taylor Fletchner (61st, 21:58.10). \nWaverly’s Jamie Welch (10th, 19:13.30) powered the Tigers to a fourth place team finish with 169 points. \nAlso in the area was Westfall (5th, 201 points), Chillicothe (14th, 327 points), Adena (18th, 395 points), Huntington (19th, 464 points) and Paint Valley (20th, 546 points). \ndwebb@chillicothegazette.com 11 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1RArC8v TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:26:58.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
