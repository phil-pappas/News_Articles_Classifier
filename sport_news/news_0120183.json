He played just 71 of a possible 164 games the past two seasons with the Knicks.\nHe made it through his summer stint with the Italian National Team, as well as the first week of training camp, without incident before the tight hamstring.\n“I want to play every practice and in every game. I just have to be cautious until I can get back 100 percent,” he said.\nNets coach Lionel Hollins has said he wants to see the pairing of Bargnani and Brook Lopez, and has praised Bargnani, the 2006 No. 1 overall pick, for his ability to score and space the floor offensively.\nBargnani wasn’t the only Net to do more Monday, as the team’s long injury list finally began to trim down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:32:42.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
