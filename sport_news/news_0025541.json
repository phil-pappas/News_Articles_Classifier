Cincinnati last played a game in the mountain time zone against another team from the Beehive State, beating Utah State 35-19 in the 1997 Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho. \nBut don't think Bearcats coach Tommy Tuberville isn't familiar with BYU (4-2) and its history-ridden offense. \n\"I've been very familiar with this offense they run at BYU, since I coached against LaVell Edwards at the University of Miami,\" said Tuberville, who was a defensive assistant with the then-No. 1 Hurricanes during BYU's 28-21 upset in 1990. \"They were on the cutting edge of Pro Style passing. There is not a lot of difference in the offense they run today as to what LaVell Edwards did years ago. \n\"It's a tribute to him and the coaches who followed him; they've just kept that engine going.\" \nBYU is also getting used to the Bearcats' conference, the newly formed American Athletic Conference. The three-year-old league was a byproduct of the old Big East's dissolution in 2013, but Tuberville said the conference has been getting better. \nThe Cougars know the strength of the conference as well, having almost lost to East Carolina last Saturday before Algie Brown's touchdown run in the final minute gave them a 45-38 Homecoming win. BYU is 21-5 all-time against current members of the AAC, with a 7-1 mark against Tulsa at the top of the list of schools primarily from the old Conference USA. \n\"I think the commitment is really strong,\" Tuberville said. \"The conference has made a huge commitment to play other teams in other leagues, the so-called Power 5 teams. I don't Cincinnati quarterback Gunner Kiel (11) throws a pass as Alabama A&M \nOn offense, Cincinnati could bring back Notre Dame transfer Gunner Kiel, the former starter who is recovering from a neck injury and was cleared to play Sunday. Or the Bearcats could lean on Hayden Moore, who made his first career start in Cincy's 34-23 upset of Miami and completed 22 of 33 passes for 279 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. \nMoore is completing 59.6 percent of his passes for 1,061 yards, seven touchdowns and five interceptions as a redshirt freshman. \nBoth quarterbacks will practice this week, and Tuberville said the starter likely will be a game time decision. \nBYU is more concerned with the Bearcats' defense, including a secondary that receivers coach Guy Holliday called \"extremely athletic.\" \n\"They're a good team,\" BYU quarterback Tanner Mangum said of Cincinnati. \"They're athletic, fast and they move well on both sides of the ball. That's going to push us to match their speed and their physicality.\" \nIf the Cougars get into a shootout, as they did against the Pirates, Mangum is confident his offense can keep pace. \n\"Whatever it takes to win,\" said Mangum, who returned from a hamstring injury to lead the Cougars' late rally and has been limited in practice this week. \"That's what we want to do as an offense: every time we go out on the field, we want to score. \n\"As an offense, we don't worry about what it's going to take. We just expect to score every time we go out ont he field, and we are developing that mindset and that attitude.\" \nAfter struggling to finish drives early in the season, BYU put together several long TD drives last week. The Cougars scored touchdowns on six of their seven scoring drives against the Pirates, compared to just three of six touchdowns a week previous against UConn. \n\"I feel like we're doing better,\" Mangum said of the offense. \"There's a lot of room to improve, things we can work on. But I feel like we are taking steps in the right direction.\" \nAnother win over an AAC opponent would be the next step in the \"right direction\" on Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:40:20.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
