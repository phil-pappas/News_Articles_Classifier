THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Lee Jin-man Canadian sprinter Andre De Grasse forgoing endorsement dollars to return to USC \nTORONTO -- Canadian sprint phenom Andre de Grasse is turning pro. \nA source says the 20-year-old from Markham, Ont., will remain in school at the University of Southern California, but will forgo his senior NCAA season of eligibility. \nDe Grasse is coming off a spectacular season that saw him win gold in both the 100 and 200 metres at the NCAA championships and the Pan American Games in Toronto. He tied for bronze behind Jamaican superstar Usain Bolt and American Justin Gatlin at the world track and field championships in August. \nDe Grasse was offered a seven-figure shoe deal after his NCAA performances but the sprinter announced shortly after his world bronze that he would complete his senior season with the USC Trojans. \nHe is currently in final negotiations with a shoe company, according to the source. \nDe Grasse became just the third Canadian to break the 10-second barrier in the 100 metres behind Donovan Bailey and Bruny Surin. (Ben Johnson ran sub-10 as well but the convicted doper's times were erased from the record books). \nDe Grasse also broke the Canadian record in the 200 metres. \nThe news comes a few days after Trayvon Bromell, the American who tied De Grasse for world bronze in Beijing, announced he was going pro. Bromell, who's also 20, decided to forgo his last two seasons of eligibility to sign with Bolt's agent Ricky Simms. He also signed an endorsement deal with New Balance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:21:15.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
