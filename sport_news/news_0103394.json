Plenty of space lies next to the final ball, just waiting for the next addition. \nIt’s been 11 seasons since Bellevue won its NOL-leading 23rd championship, but the Redmen have a chance to put an end to that Friday night. Bellevue (6-2 overall, 4-0 NOL) hosts Shelby (5-3, 4-1) at 7 p.m. Friday with a chance to clinch at least a share of the league title. \n“Our class has been pretty successful through every level, but this is something we really had in the back of our mind for all those years,” Bellevue senior two-way lineman Jared Hoy said. “It’s been so long, we’re really hungry for it and we want to be that team that gets it done and brings it back home to Bellevue.” \nNot only can Bellevue claim an NOL championship Friday, the Redmen also are battling for a playoff berth. The Redmen are No. 10 in Division IV, Region 12, but winning their final two games likely puts them in the postseason. \nBut the notion of mentioning either the prospect of a championship or the necessity of winning to make the playoffs is out of the question for coach Ed Nasonti. \nFor Nasonti, who got the 200th victory of his 25-year coaching career last week against Willard, the impetus of every day is simply to focus on that day, not on what happens if the Redmen win or lose. \n“I don’t live in circumstance,” Nasonti said. “I live in my vision and the process, that’s where I live. Media guys, it’s ‘You got a big game this week’ and ‘Big game next week.’ \n“Our focus is on the process. Winning is just a byproduct of the process that you go through.” \nThat process has been paying off for the Redmen of late. Since Week 4, Bellevue is 5-0, averaging 43.6 points per game while allowing an average of just seven points against, including a pair of shutouts. \n“I think we’re playing well, and I think we’re practicing well, too,” junior quarterback Alec Foos said. “That’s something I’ve noticed over the past couple weeks. Our practices are really picking up the speed. ... We’re really starting to click at the right time.” \nShelby comes into Bellevue coming off a 46-13 win over Ontario and, playing its final league game, a Whippet win Friday will get the team at least a share of the NOL league title. Sandusky and Bellevue would have to win their Week 10 games to share the crown with Shelby. \nShelby is led by its quarterback Brennan Armstrong, who leads the NOL in passing with for 1,230 yards and 13 touchdowns and has completed 69 of 140 passes. He has also 796 yards and 15 touchdowns rushing. \nFoos (1,254 yards rushing, 17 touchdowns) and Armstrong are Nos. 1 and 2 in the NOL in rushing and scoring. \n“He’s a really good athlete and he has a real nice arm,” Nasonti said of Armstrong. “They don’t do a lot of things offensively, but they run them well. They have the opportunity to run or pass it, and he’s good on his feet and he gets rid of it quick.” If you go \nWhat: Shelby (5-3 overall, 4-1 Northern Ohio League) at Bellevue (6-2, 4-0); w inner wins at least a share of the NOL championship. \nWhen: 7 p.m. Friday \nWhere: Bellevue High School \nFYI: Follow along with the game by following Rich McGowan on Twitter @RMcGowan1 or by going to www.thenews-messenger.com/SPORTS.
