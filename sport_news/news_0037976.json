He’s accused of following the men, pulling up to their car and opening fire.\n Hernandez’s lawyers say insufficient evidence was presented to the grand jury to establish probable cause.\nThe defense also will argue that evidence seized from the SUV Hernandez was in should be tossed out because police obtained a search warrant relying on statements made by a man who failed a lie-detector test.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:02:40.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
