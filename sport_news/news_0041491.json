I think even in some of his comments this week, he’s spoken to wanting to run the ball more, so I think we’re going to get a good dose of it.” Rutgers BOG athletics committee discussed \nFlood referred to Coleman’s performance — the best individual rushing effort ever during a Rutgers on-campus home game — as “the proverbial red gumball.” In other words, the much-desired but hard-to-get prize. \nColeman was a 2015 NFL Draft third-round pick of the Atlanta Falcons, who are coached by Flood’s longtime friend Dan Quinn. \n“He certainly got a good recommendation from me, I would tell you that,” Flood said. “He’s a special player and a tough guy to defend, but they’ve got good players there now even though they’re a little banged-up at that position.” \nIndiana halfback Jordan Howard leads the Big Ten with 141.8 rushing yards per game and is second to Ohio State’s Ezekiel Elliott with 709 total rushing yards. The UAB transfer missed last week’s game with an ankle injury and is questionable against Rutgers. \nThe idea that Rutgers survived Coleman’s barrage with a 45-23 win led one defensive player to respectfully refer to it as a “quiet 300 yards” in the postgame locker room. A year later, however, defensive end Djwany Mera said the number still resonates loudly with him. Eric LeGrand, 5 years after injury, only takes no from Secret Service \n“It definitely touches your heart a little bit,” Mera said, “so we are going to have to figure out some way to stop it this weekend.” \nRutgers ranks No. 6 in the Big Ten in rushing defense (118.8 yards per game), but Penn State gashed the defense for 330 rushing yards, with two 100-yard backs. \n“Indiana executes well,” defensive tackle Julian Pinnix-Odrick said. “Running backs don’t run for that kind of yardage by themselves. They have a lot of guys back, and they are very efficient. \n“It was too many yards last year, and we are going to try to hold them under that this year by being very detailed with what we do best.” \nDefensive coordinator Joe Rossi appeared to be more aggressive in his play-calling last week in a 31-24 loss to No. 4 Michigan State. Who are the 5 best players Rutgers still must face? \n“We had an emphasis on physicality in practice,” Pinnix-Odrick said. “We don’t play in baby league. Every week is going to be a battle.” \nPinnix-Odrick has replaced out-for-the-season Darius Hamilton as a starter but isn’t the only defensive lineman taking on an expanded role. \nNose tackle Kevin Wilkins has seen increased reps, and true freshman Jon Batkey is playing on third downs. \n“We’re having the opportunity to play more guys,” Flood said. “Overall, as you go through the year, you’re going to need that. And if they do have to take on a bigger role — somebody gets dinged up — they’ll be more prepared to do it. \n“It’s good to see that depth being developed. I’ve always said we’d love to play eight defensive linemen in the game, and I think we’re getting pretty close to doing that.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 3 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LwlZar TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:25:03.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
