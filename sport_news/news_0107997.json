The Kansas City Royals take an early 2-0 lead in the top of the 1st over the Toronto Blue Jays.\nThe Blue Jays challenged a tag play call on the field was upheld. With Kendrys Morales batting, Lorenzo Cain scored.\nMike Moustakas was out on a sacrifice fly to center field and Eric Hosmer scored. Royals up 4-0 in 1st.\nIn the 2nd inning, Alex Rios hit a solo home run on a fly ball to center field and the Royals increased their lead 5-0. When Alcides Escobar was at bat, he got hit by a pitch.\nPrevious Story: \nIt's 59 degrees Fahrenheit and cloudy in Toronto but the roof is closed again. It was closed Monday night for Game 3 of the ALCS, too, even though it was 57 degrees at first pitch â€” that's 12 degrees warmer than it was for Game 2 at Citi Field in New York for the Mets-Cubs NLCS game on Sunday.\n\"I was in New York on Saturday night and 12 degrees was not enough,\" Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday.\nMajor League baseball determines if the roof will be open or closed for postseason games, and Manfred was at Rogers Centre for Game 4. He said it was raining earlier on his way to the ballpark.\n\"Why would you take a chance with a game this important. Now, whether it actually rains enough to interfere with play who knows but, again, when you have a roof why would you take a chance with it,\" he said. \"My general thinking on things like this is things like this is that the individual clubs locally know best what should happen in their stadium.\"\nThe Blue Jays were 38-14 with it open and 11-14 closed, and 4-0 with a combination of the two.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
