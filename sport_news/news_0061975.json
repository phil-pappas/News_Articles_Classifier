Exhausted by the publicity, the couple told no one about their photographic assignment. Lindbergh taught his new bride, Anne, to pilot the plane while he took the photographs.\nBeginning in 2006, Heisey – the official pilot for the Navajo Nation – began shooting his own aerial views of the same rugged terrain, commissioned by the Tucson, Ariz. -based Archaeology Southwest.\n“He’s very smart and thoughtful and he has an artistic eye,” curator Maxine McBrinn said. “He knows what he’s photographing and he knows how to get it.”\nDuring 2007, 2008 and 2015, Heisey flew at alarmingly low altitudes and slow speeds, leaning out the door of his light plane and holding his camera with both hands. He rephotographed many of the area’s most significant archaeological sites captured by the Lindberghs.\n“He scanned the original images at the Palace of the Governors” and kept photocopies, McBrinn said. “His personal plane speed was as slow as 30 mph. He’s shooting digitally and he’s got his computer there to compare and see how it works.”\nStanding rock as photographed by Charles and Anne Lindbergh in 1929.

Heisey’s images correspond to the Lindberghs’ perspective, time of year and time of day.\nThe exhibition gathers seven images of Chaco Canyon, seven of Canyon de Chelly and three from the northern Rio Grande.\nChaco Canyon’s Pueblo Bonito emerges as a D-shaped pueblo scattered with circular kivas. The pueblo contains more than 300 ground-floor rooms. Threatening Rock, a slab of stone detached from the canyon wall, was largely intact in the Lindberghs’ photo. Ancient puebloans had tried to stabilize it by propping it with pine poles and bolstering it with a wide-stone terrace beneath. The solution lasted nearly 1,000 years.\nBy the time of Heisey’s image, the slab has collapsed and crumbled to the ground in 35,000 tons of rock. The monolith fell in 1941, McBrinn said. The abundance of vegetation offers another dramatic difference in the contemporary photo. Farmers and ranchers were still using the site for livestock grazing in 1929. The later photo also reveals extensive excavation, with grids of exposed houses and kivas.\nAfter more than a century of research, archaeologists still debate whether the Chaco system was religious, economic or political in nature.\nAlso at Chaco, Chetro Ketl was in the early stages of excavation by archeologist Edgar Lee Hewitt when the Lindberghs came by.\n“You can see a couple of his trucks and a couple of people,” McBrinn said.\nStanding Rock with Navajo fields in Canyon del Muerto in Canyon de Chelly, as photographed by Adriel Heisey in an attempt to re-create a photo made by Charles and Anne Lindbergh. (Courtesy of The Museum of New Mexico)\nThe site features two great kivas and at least 10 smaller kivas. It originally contained at least 600 rooms.\nHeisey’s version reveals the exposure of additional stabilized rooms and kivas and that fewer rooms have been excavated than at Pueblo Bonito. A more recent park service road and walking trails bisect the area. Ancient Chaco roads above lead to the site.\nThe Jackson Staircase, hacked from the stone, snakes from the mesa top to the ruin to allow visitors to move between Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Alto. The addition was named for William Henry Jackson, famous for his early photographs of the West.\nLocated in Canyon del Muerto, Canyon de Chelly’s Standing Rock cradles an archaeological site dating between 1100 and 1300 A.D. The Lindbergh frame reveals a circular arrangement of plants in a Navajo field to the rock’s left, suggesting it was an orchard.\nThe contemporary scene is similar except that the stream has changed course and plants sprout from the field in a more linear layout. The field has shrunk since 1929, thanks to a slump of debris from the canyon wall to the left.\nFor Lindbergh, it all started after a goodwill flight to Mexico City, where he met Anne Morrow, the U.S. ambassador’s daughter. While flying over the Yucatán region of southern Mexico in late 1928, he spotted a cluster of stone ruins.\nIntrigued, he visited the Smithsonian Institution to learn more. The museum directed him to the Carnegie Institution. After learning that aerial photography could help with archaeological studies, he offered his services.\n“You can see things from an aerial perspective that you could never see on the ground,” McBrinn said.\nThough visitors often see New Mexico as a place of timeless antiquity, reality hijacks this notion.\nThe now-and-then photographs of Heisey and Lindbergh allow viewers to discover the scale shifting time, nature and humanity have wrought across more than 80 years.\n“We improve, stabilize or neglect our surroundings,” McBrinn writes in the accompanying catalog. “We are the agents of change.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life06_jd_18oct_4lindbergh-400x300.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life06_jd_18oct_2lindbergh-640x482.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life06_jd_18oct_3lindbergh-400x266.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:40:56.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
