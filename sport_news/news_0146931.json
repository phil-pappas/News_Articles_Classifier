San Jacinto Ave.; and at the San Jacinto Library, 500 Idyllwild Drive\nWhen: Monday, Oct. 12, through Thursday, Nov. 19\nSan Jacinto is hoping residents step forward to help figure out how to best protect the city.\nThe City Council voted Tuesday night, Oct. 6, to create a Public Safety Committee of five citizens, who will join the ad hoc committee of councilmen Mark Bartel and Andrew Kotyuk in investigating options for police services.\nSan Jacinto contracts with Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, but is pondering joining 11 other cities in forming a new regional police department, or bringing back the San Jacinto Police Department, which was disbanded in 2004.\nRegistered voters living in the city may apply to serve on the committee. Applications will be available starting Monday, Oct. 12, and will be accepted until Nov. 19. They will be screened by council members Crystal Ruiz and Alonso Ledezma, who will bring recommendations to the full council.\nRuiz, the mayor, implored residents to apply.\n“Be part of the solution,” she urged those in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting, while Kotyuk said such important decisions can’t be made by the council alone.\n“This is a big decision for the city of San Jacinto,” he said.\nCouncil members were quick to point out that looking at options has nothing to do with the performance of the Sheriff’s Department, praising the service the city receives. But with more than half of the city’s general fund spent on law enforcement – and the contract expected to continue getting more expensive – the city is trying to find the best way to spend what few dollars it has.\nThe city is paying $8.5 million to the Sheriff’s Department this year, as part of a $10 million law enforcement budget, and is facing a $700,000 increase in the contract cos for the next fiscal year. That’s from a total general fund of $18 million.\n“The problem is not with the Sheriff’s Department,” Ruiz said. “The problem is the amount of money that’s increasing, increasing, increasing.”\nSan Jacinto and the 11 other cities that contract with the Sheriff’s Department are seeking bids from firms that would study the feasibility of creating a joint powers authority for police services.\n“It’s not a reflection on the Sheriff’s Department; we have to do our due diligence and see what’s out there,” Bartel said.\nA city police department would cost $11.1 million to restart and an anticipated $9 million per year to operate, City Manager Tim Hults wrote in a report.\n“It’s really important that we find solutions.” Ruiz said. “This council has been about solving problems of the past.”\nShe said no option is off the table, but there is one goal in mind.\n“We’re not going to do anything that’s not going to help the city,” she said.\nFormer council candidate and frequent critic Jim Pangrazzi called the process “ridiculous.”\n“You spend money on something you can’t accomplish because you ain’t got the money to accomplish it,” he said.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9086 or cshultz@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvvg01-b88530908z.120151007153151000gv9cevk2.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://www.ci.san-jacinto.ca.us/", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvvg01-b88530908z.120151007153151000gv9cevk2.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:35:59.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
