Opportunities to make the trip are scare, with flights coming and going only twice a week.\nIn recent seasons, few college football teams have poured more resources and time into making the trek to the remote island than Oregon State and Washington State . That persistence has paid off and those two Pac-12 programs, which matchup in Pullman on Saturday at 1 p.m. They have dominated the recent recruiting results in the place \"60 Minutes\" referred to as \"Football Island\" in a 2010 piece .\nIn 2011, neither team had an American Samoa native on its respective roster. Washington State has seven this year, closely followed by four at Oregon State. Those numbers are the highest on any FBS team.\nFor each program, coaches believe that the considerable sleep-deprived days filled with time zone changes are worth the extra effort.\n\"I don't mind when it gives a chance for another kid,\" Washington State assistant head coach Joe Salave'a said. \"If you get a couple of those kids on your team, I bet my bottom dollar that a lot of those kids will do better than many five-star kids.\"\n***\nThe 2015 season is the first in Corvallis for Chad Kauha'aha'a .\nOregon State's defensive line coach previously held the same position at Wisconsin and followed Gary Andersen during the head coach's exodus from Madison last December.\nAlong with an extensive résumé as a Division I coach, Kauha'aha'a brought a wealth of experience recruiting American Samoa. He estimated he had been targeting players from the area for 8-10 years and when he left Wisconsin, he convinced defensive line commit Elu Aydon to join him and Andersen at Oregon State.\nOregon State defensive line coach Chad Kauha'aha'a travels to American Samoa multiple times per year for recruiting. He said academic support is often more important to recruits than wins and losses. Randy L. Rasmussen/Staff Aydon's move to the Beavers extended a pipeline that the previous coaching staff under Mike Riley started building over three years ago. The staff had success once it targeted the area, bringing in Noke Tago, Rommel Mageo and Fred Lauina in a two-year period.\nLike Salave'a, Kauha'aha'a will put up with the lengthy commute. Since he first made his trip to the island, he said the coaching and versatility of the players has dramatically improved. Now top targets more frequently display skillsets for positions beyond linemen, a traditional position strength from the territory that is slightly larger than Washington, D.C.\nWhen Washington State upset Oregon in double overtime last Saturday, junior safety Shalom Luani – an American Samoa native – made the game-sealing interception.\nOne area in which the island lags behind is quality game tape.\n\"Sometimes it just follows the ball and you don't get to see the whole play,\" Kauha'aha'a said. \"People are cheering and the camera's bouncing around. You still deal with that problem.\"\nSpotty film makes it all the more essential to make the journey that costs up to $2,000 and tallies more than 5,000 miles.\nThose trips have also gone a long way to building essential bonds in the area, according to Suaese \"Pooch\" Taase, the head coach at Fagaitua High School in American Samoa.\n\"It's their dedication,\" Taase said when asked about each program's recruiting success. \"They come in the spring. After the spring they follow up.\n\"They're pretty consistent.\"\nSalave'a is in his fourth year at Washington State as a member of Mike Leach's staff. He was once in a position not dissimilar to the players he now recruits. Salave'a is an American Samoa native who attended high school in the United States, became an all-Pac-10 offensive lineman at Arizona and went on to a lengthy NFL career.\nHis lifetime background with the area is a distinct recruiting advantage, according to Kauha'aha'a.\n\"We don't have that inside family tie,\" Kauha'aha'a said. \"So us non-natives to American Samoa better spend extra time there to make sure we build those relationships with the parents and coaches.\n\"And you can't come in late on the guys there, especially if you're recruiting against another team.\"\nJoe Salave'a (95), an American Samoa native who had a lengthy NFL career, has helped bring in seven other natives of the territory to Washington State. Danny Moran | The Oregonian/OregonLive A trip in the spring is a given for both coaches. If he is in serious pursuit of a recruit, Kauha'aha'a will have likely already made a pair of visits by January. That was the commitment he made this past winter while tracking Aydon and Logan Tago, the island's high school player of the year who now plays at Washington State.\nThere are times when Salave'a will commit a full week to American Samoa. He will leave Monday and catch the next flight back to the U.S. on Friday. That means he does not return to Pullman until Sunday.\nEven for the native with a strong, established connection to the area, the extra time abroad is worth it if it means getting an advantage over other Pac-12 competitors.\n\"It's a matter of trying to have a true connection down there,\" Salave'a said.\nTo this point, dealing with the travel grind has made an impact.\nHawaii is physically closer to American Samoa than any other Division I program. It has traditionally stacked its roster with players from the island. But even the Rainbow Warriors do not currently have as many American Samoa natives on their roster as either Oregon State or Washington State.\n***\nNoke Tago had three television stations growing up in his village in Pago Pago and barely watched any college football before reaching Corvallis in 2012.\n\"I didn't even care about how the teams were playing (while being recruited),\" Tago said. \"I didn't even care about how the players and the coaches were doing. I just wanted to do my part and then get out of there.\"\nThis was a similar experience to starting guard Fred Lauina , who joined the team one year after Tago. The two-star recruit from Nu'uuli was familiar with the nation's top teams, like Alabama, but his knowledge base did not extend to Oregon State until the school seriously pushed for his services.\n\"I had no idea (about Oregon State),\" Lauina said. \"I just picked whatever school wanted me the most.\"\n\"I hate to say it,\" Noke Tago (91) said, \"but we suck academic-wise.\" Tago said Oregon State's academic was the biggest reason he picked the school. Randy L. Rasmussen/Staff According to statistics from the American Samoa Department of Commerce , 57 percent of people 18 and over living on the island are in poverty. Families with children under 18 years old are affected in even greater numbers, with 62.2 percent below the poverty line.\nEven as more players continue to reach the United States to play football, these factors can make cable television a luxury. It also affects on-field equipment. High school teams often must solicit private donations for uniforms and helmets. On some rosters, teammates must share helmets.\nWhile these challenges can be commonplace on American Samoa, an even bigger challenge when it comes to reaching college is academics.\nSamoan is the native language on the island, which Tago and Lauina said put them at a disadvantage when entering a four-year university.\nThat is why Kauha'aha'a and Salave'a each said that a frequent indicator of recruiting success comes down to laying out a plan for academic support.\nKauha'aha'a likes to have a player's relative come on their recruiting visit whenever possible in order to highlight their academic plan. There are not specific steps in place for American Samoa natives but an Oregon State academic counselor wrote in an email that players from the country are encouraged to join the university's BEST Summer Bridge Program , an immersion program for incoming student athletes.\n\"(Academic eligibility) can be a challenge,\" Kauha'aha'a said. \"It's up to us to evaluate the kid academically and see if he can survive in school. I know he's a good player but will he survive academically? Is he worth the risk? A majority of these kids are worth the risk.\"\nWashington State safety Shalom Luani (18) made an interception on the final play of the Cougars' double-overtime win at Oregon last Saturday. Young Kwak/AP Salave'a agreed that the academic path mattered more than wins and losses.\n\"You cannot just go down there and stretch the truth about your school,\" Salave'a said. \"The learning and the rigor and the challenges are even more with those kids.\n\"It's not an easy transition.\"\n***\nWhen the Cougars upset Oregon in double overtime last week, Tago texted a congratulatory message to Washington State defensive lineman Robert Barber.\nTago and Barber were friends back in Pago Pago and even though they chose schools on opposite ends of a recruiting battle, they remain connected while thousands of miles from home.\nLauina said he knows four of the seven American Samoans on the Washington State roster. He played with Destiny Vaeao and Frankie Luvu and against Barber and Daniel Ekuale.\nThe group stays close-knit, sharing a cultural experience with which few can empathize. On Saturday, Lauina stressed that sentiment will not extend on the field until after the final whistle.\n\"This is about pride and honor,\" he said.\n-- Danny Moran\ndmoran@oregonian.com\n@DannyJMoran", "external_links": ["http://oregonstate.edu/studentathlete/best", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208954060", "http://www.spc.int/prism/americansamoa/index.php", "https://twitter.com/DannyJMoran", "http://www.osubeavers.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPID=127145", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209804010", "http://www.spc.int/prism/americansamoa/index.php/social/poverty/family-poverty-status", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=207912443", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-samoa-football-island-17-09-2010/", "http://www.osubeavers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209820758", "http://www.wsucougars.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPID=126813", "http://www.wsucougars.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=207918075"], "published": "2015-10-17T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:34:19.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
