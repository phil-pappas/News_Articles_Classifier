With kickoff at around 8:05 p.m., it was the hometown Zebras talented running back duo that would put on their own display of nature’s fury as Maurice Ffrench provided the lightning and Samad Davila the thunder. \nIn a flash, the Pittsburgh-bound Ffrench, would break open a closely fought first half with a 65-yard electrifying punt return for a touchdown as well as a 62-yard back-breaking jet sweep down the Zebra sideline that would put New Brunswick up 20-6 at the 1:02 mark just before halftime. \nLost in all the shock and awe of Ffrench’s first half offensive prowess, was his equally dominant performance as a defender covering the league’s leading receiver Quassim Glover in tight bump and run coverage all over the field. It was New Brunswick’s brilliant game plan to pressure Woodbridge’s own dynamic duo of QB Tracy Fudge and Glover that would prove to be the difference maker in this battle for White Division supremacy and post-season positioning. Ffrench helps turn the tide for New Brunswick football \nDefensive stalwarts German Pimental and Mohammed Bangura harassed and pressured Fudge the entire night while not allowing him to sit back and feel comfortable in the pocket. \nUncharacteristically the league’s top-rated passer missed a few wide-open Barrons and threw 2 interceptions to New Brunswick’s Kadas Reams who played an equally important role in clamping down on Glover in the second half. \nNew Brunswick would get the second half kickoff having deferred the choice at the coin toss to start the game. Ffrench would get the kickoff inside the 10-yard line and return it to the Zebra \n36-yard line as collective sigh of relief could be heard by the raucous visiting Barron student section. The Zebras would march to the Woodbridge 21-yard line with the thought of spreading out the carries between Ffrench , Davila and occasionally QB Jeffery-Seawright. The Barron’s defense would stiffen as they stopped the Zebras on consecutive third and fourth down rushes. \nDown by two scores, Woodbridge realized that the Zebras strong running game might limit their number of touches in the second half. After a Lanier jet sweep for little or no gain, Fudge would roll to his right looking to throw a corner route to Glover near the Barron sideline. New Brunswick’s unsung hero CB Kadas Reams would undercut the route securing his second interception of the game. \nNew Brunswick would squander great field position at midfield as the Barrons were not about to let the game get out of hand as they stuffed consecutive runs and forced Jeffery-Seawright to intentionally throw away the ball while under pressure from the Woodbridge defense. \nWoodbridge would start at their own 39-yard line with Fudge rolling left looking to throw an out route to Glover in front of the Zebra bench. Enter Reams who batted the ball away in tough press coverage much to the dismay of the Barron faithful. On second down Fudge would sprint right looking to avoid the Zebra pressure and launch another deep ball to the closely covered outstretched arms of Glover which fell incomplete. Facing third and 10 Woodbridge would get a pass interference call setting them up in Zebra territory at the 46-yard line. \nWoodbridge would mix a jet sweep for no gain and then be sacked for an 8-yard loss by the rangy Pimental, New Brunswick’s talented left defensive end. The Barrons would benefit from another New Brunswick penalty along the Woodbridge sideline as Fudge scrambled on third and long taking a hit out of bounds. An inside run would move the ball to the Zebra 29-yard line. On the very next play Fudge would throw a perfect fade pass to the leaping Glover for a 29-yard touchdown which was followed by a successful 2-point conversion inside run. Woodbridge would close the gap to 20-14 with 2:46 remaining in the third quarter. \nNew Brunswick would be forced to start on the their own 20-yard line as Barron PK Harry Rutkowski would drill the ensuing kickoff over Ffrench’s head and into the end zone. Enter the thunder, as FB Samad Davila would rumble 23 yards on an inside run giving the Zebras a first down and their 43-yard line. After a rare 5-yard loss by Ffrench on a jet sweep to the right, New Brunswick would run Ffrench in motion again to the right this time curling up to the inside while isolating him one one with a linebacker. Ffrench caught the pass turning inside and then spinning back outside and down the Zebra sideline for a scintillating 53-yard catch and run to the Woodbridge 9-yard line. Hurt on the play was WR/LB Kyshaun Jackson that lay motionless on the field as EMS personnel transported him off the field after a 15-minute delay. Jackson gestured to the cheering crowd a thumbs up as was wheeled past the Memorial Stadium stands. \nOn first and goal Davila looked to score on a left inside run but was ruled down on the half yard line. A Jeffery-Seawright QB sneak for a touchdown and a failed two-point conversion attempt put the Zebras on top 26-14 with 11 seconds remaining in the third quarter. \nIf Woodbridge was to get back in the game, they would have to go back to the no-huddle offense they so adeptly ran on their first offensive series staking them to their only lead of 6-0 early in the first quarter. After an incomplete pass on a well-defended play by Ffrench on Barron WR James Modica, Fudge looked to complete a first down quick out to Lanier who was in motion running to the flat and down the Zebra sideline. A holding penalty would set Woodbridge back thus thwarting the drive and forcing the Barrons to punt the ball back to New Brunswick. \nLooking to milk the clock, New Brunswick would put the game in Davila’s hands as he powered his way down the field on 4 of the 5 rushing plays that put the ball on the Barron 9 –yard line. It was Davila’s 49-yard burst on the same exact play that set up his own 9-yard left inside TD run putting the Zebras up by 18 points at 32-14 with little left in the third quarter. \nWoodbridge would only get two more opportunities to rally for a miraculous comeback scoring on a Fudge to Lanier 12-yard TD reception with 1:47 to go in the game. The failed two-point conversion and subsequent onsides kick attempt recovered by New Brunswick’s Pimental, left the Barrons on the short-end of a 32-20 Zebras victory that left them as one of two unbeaten teams in the GMC.
