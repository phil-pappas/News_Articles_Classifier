WAYNE – Despite getting a complete makeover this season, the Wayne Hills girls tennis team positioned itself to win an unprecedented 13th straight Passaic County tournament crown on Thursday.\nPatriots senior Katarina Kolarski hit the nail on the head, saying, \"Don’t write off Wayne Hills.\"\n\"We’re all really positive and focused,\" Kolarski said. \"I think we can do it.\"\nOn Thursday, Wayne Hills finished the semifinals with a 14-13 lead over West Milford, which won a regular-season match between the teams last month. More importantly, the Patriots sent four entries into today’s finals to their rivals’ three.\n\"Everyone is so dedicated this season,\" Wayne Hills junior Jess Goldman said. \"We’re encouraging each other to try our hardest so we can win it again.\"\nWayne Hills came up with two critical, semifinal victories at the end of the day as the second-doubles pair of Hima Tallam and Divya Yagamurthy topped West Milford’s Emily Fulton and Tatiana Nicheporuck in the only head-to-head meeting between the two teams.\nAfter that match ended, Wayne Hills’ Maddy Flynn wrapped up the proceedings with a riveting victory over Hawthorne’s Rachel Zuckerberg. Flynn gave her team its one-point lead by winning 3-6, 7-6(2) and 6-4.\nLeading Wayne Hills’ revamped lineup was Goldman, who won last year’s county first-doubles crown and then rocketed up to being the top overall seed in this tourney.\n\"At the beginning of the season I was like, ‘Oh my God! We lost all three of last year’s singles players,’ \" Goldman said. \"That’s when it hit me.\n\"Now being the top seed at first singles, it’s almost surreal. That was always my goal, though. That and making it to the finals.\"\nGoldberg made it by topping Hawthorne’s Erika LaMonaca in the semis, 6-1 and 6-0.\nIn second singles, Kolarski had a relatively easy time as she knocked off Lakeland’s China Chung in the semis, 6-1 and 6-3.\nWhile Wayne Hills ended Day One with the lead, West Milford was still in the hunt. Senior Tess Korinko said winning counties is all her team has been talking about for days.\n\"We know what kind of potential we have,\" Korinko said. \"If we follow through with that, we know how good it’ll feel in the end.\"\nKorinko felt great after reaching the first-singles final with a two-set victory over Wayne Valley’s Abby Schwartz. Korinko’s classmate, Theresa Fernbacher, needed three sets to oust Eastern Christian’s Rachel Schultz in the second singles semis.\n\"I knew my team was counting on me so there was a lot of pressure,\" Fernbacher said. \"But you’re on the court to play tennis so you have to block out everything else. I came up with a boost of energy in the third set and that was the key.\"\nIn their first-singles match, Korinko and Wayne Valley’s Abby Schwartz expended all sorts of energy in their first game as they went to deuce six times. Korinko finally won it and poured it on from there, winning a 6-2, 6-0 decision.\n\"It’s hard to come back when you lose a game like that,\" Korinko said. \"Winning that one was a big boost for my confidence.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:34.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
