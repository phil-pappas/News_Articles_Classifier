The four-time All-Star defenseman got to see his name on the Cup for the first time, pick up his 355-diamond set, white-gold championship ring and take part in the Blackhawks' opening-night banner-raising ceremony at United Center. \nWednesday night will be another big night for Timonen, who will be honored before the Flyers -Blackhawks' 8 p.m. game at Wells Fargo Center. \n\"I'll be emotional probably,\" he said. \"Wednesday is going to be another thing I'm going to really enjoy. I'm really honored to be there. I get to bring my parents to the game, so I'm looking forward to it.\" \nPhiladelphia feels like home for Timonen, a native of Finland who still lives in South Jersey with his family and may never leave. He didn't even spend half of his NHL career with the Flyers, but his seven seasons with them are more meaningful than his first eight with Nashville and his short but sweet time playing in a reduced role for Chicago. \nALSO: Hextall on Timonen winning Cup: \"They should make a movie\" \nAsked if a conference call last weekend if he considers himself a Flyer, Timonen said, \"Yes I do. Obviously I was in Nashville for eight years and I was the captain there. My kids were born in Nashville. So those memories are really nice. \n\"Here in Philly, I think my role was so good and playing for the Flyers in front of these fans, it was something I'll remember for the rest of my life. We like the area here. We like to live here, and that's why we're back here. My kids like it here and they like the school. I think the Flyers are my No. 1 team.\" \nTimonen was touched last season with all the love that he received from Flyers fans while he was recovering from career-threatening blood clots, then again after his Feb. 27 trade to Chicago. Yes, he was very aware a lot of Flyers fans wanted him to end his career as a Stanley Cup champion even though he was a Blackhawk. \n\"There were some tough times during the last year, and to be able to hear people are behind you and they wish you to win, it was really cool and made me proud,\" Timonen said. \"It was a tough time being away from the family for four months and to not to be in the role you wanted to be in the team, and everything was kind of new to me. But when I heard people were cheering for me and were behind me, it made me happy.\" \nDown the road, Timonen figures to be honored again at Wells Fargo Center, as he's a lock someday to have his No. 44 go into the rafters as a Flyers Hall of Famer. \nThere's a lot of great names up there, great players,\" Timonen said. \"If that's the case one of these days, I would be really honored.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:29:13.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
