It was the kind of result club president Brendan Shanahan wanted to see in the opener from his management’s suite on Friday, offence, puck possession, good special teams and recovery from miscues related to team defence.\n“For sure, we’re a young team and a lot of people will be watching us,” said winger Zach Hyman, who picked up his first pro point. “We’re a young group and we just kept coming. It was a good first win for the coach and all the new guys.”\nKeefe, with his old Soo junior boss Kyle Dubas looking on, too, kept tabs on first rounders William Nylander and Freddy Gauthier, 23-year-old NCAA grad Hyman, new captain Andrew Campbell and demoted Leaf Richard Panik.\n“I’m getting a feel for all the guys on the bench,” said Keefe. “Who is going to be called upon to do this or that, who will play better with whom and on special teams. That will come for me as I get comfortable with the names.\n“But we also wanted to put these guys in tough spots against the other team’s best players to see how they could handle it.\n“I thought there were good chunks of the game for us. We hit four posts within a few minutes (out-shooting Winnipeg’s farm team 33-24 overall). We made some adjustments to hold onto the puck more in the second period and get them tired. We had some breakdowns and turnovers that opened the door for them to come back, but it’s Game One, we’ll get that sorted out.”\nEleven different Marlies had a point, with Josh Leivo, Sam Carrick and Panik all getting two. Still to be heard from is Pittsburgh’s former first rounder forward Kasperi Kapanen, out with an illness on Friday and replaced by former KHLer Nikita Soshnikov.\nStill smarting from being dumped on NHL waivers earlier in the week, Panik had little time to mope when Keefe gave him prime power play assignments when not on regular shifts with Hyman and Byron Froese.\n“For the first game, we did great things and we got some points,” Panik said.\nUltimately, he wants back on the Leafs, where he scored 11 goals last year.\n“I have to just play hard every game. It sounds like a cliche, but it’s the right thing to do to earn a spot there.”\nThat said, he was on a stacked Norfolk team a few years ago under the Tampa Bay Lightning banner, which beat the Marlies in the Calder Cup.\n“I’m here to help,” he added. “I was on a great team that won the Calder, it was an amazing year for me. I think this team has a lot of talent if it plays the right way.”\nKeefe had a no-brainer linking Nylander and the electric Connor Brown from last year. They hooked up with Panik for Nylander’s game opening power-play goal. Pugnacious Rich Clune was their regular winger, a strong forechecker who could supply the young duo lots of pucks this season. Keefe saw them play together during a Leafs exhibitiion game and thought they’d do well here.\nGauthier was between Matt Frattin and Soshnikov, while Leivo excelled alongside Brendan Leipsic and Carrick.\nThe hardest bodycheck of the night was delivered - cleanly - by defenceman Viktor Loov, who received a costly two-game suspension for a dangerous hit in last May’s playoffs. Antoine Bibeau, heartbroken last year when given that Game 5 assignment in Grand Rapids that ended the Marlies’ season, stopped a Joel Armia breakaway to get his feet wet.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nAHL\nMarlies beat Moose in AHL season opener\nBy Lance Hornby , Toronto Sun First posted: Friday, October 09, 2015 11:24 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 09, 2015 11:26 PM EDT\nIf the pain for the Maple Leafs will be at the Air Canada Centre this year, the gain should be down the road at the Ricoh Coliuseum.\nOn the same night the parent club fell to 0-2 in NHL play, the Marlies farm team debuted under new coach Sheldon Keefe with a 5-3 win over the Manitoba Moose.
