(AP) Kentucky senior nose guard Melvin Lewis is out for the remainder of the regular season with a broken leg sustained in Thursday's loss to Auburn. \nCoach Mark Stoops said Monday the senior will have surgery Tuesday for a fractured fibula. The coach says recovery normally takes six weeks and that he hoped Lewis could heal in time to play in a bowl game if the Wildcats (4-2, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) qualify for postseason. \nStoops says, \"We need to try to win a few more games down the stretch here and give him an opportunity to try to come back and play one last time.\" \nLewis had 20 tackles and a sack while starting four of six games. Sophomore Matt Elam will replace him in Saturday night's game at Mississippi State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:31:53.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
