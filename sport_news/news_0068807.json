View More... \nBelfast — Belfast Area High School's Kylie Nelson seemingly always has had a nose for the cage and knack for scoring goals — as well as setting them. \nNelson, a stalwart on the school's field hockey team, set two personal goals early in her high school tenure: To break the school's record for goals in a season and goals for a career. \nAs it turned out, the team's 12-0 win over host Lincoln Academy of Newcastle on Monday, Sept. 28 was an important day for the forward — as she broke both records in the same game. \nNelson, also one of the state's top track pole vaulters, was tied with 2014 BAHS graduate Madison Cummings with 49 career goals heading into the team's game against the Eagles. \nBy game's end, Nelson had shattered the record as she found the back of the cage five times. \nAfter scoring one goal each in recent wins over Leavitt of Turner and Lawrence of Fairfield, Nelson has 56 career goals — and 26 goals on the season, both school records. \nCummings had set the single-season scoring bar at 20 goals during her senior year with the Lions. \nMore impressively, Nelson has accomplished all this as a junior — and shows no signs of slowing down. \nNelson has scored five goals in one game twice this season (against Lincoln Academy and Marancook of Readfield), has seven multi-goal games and has scored at least one goal in all but one of the team's regular-season contests. \n“It's really exciting for me because I knew in the beginning of the season I wanted to break the record, but everyone kind of doubted me and said, 'No you aren't going to do it,' ” Nelson said. “I set a goal for myself, which was to score 27 goals in the season, knowing that might push me to break the record.” \nBelfast has two more games in the regular season and the Lions could qualify to participate in the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference Class B championship game prior to the start of the Class B North playoffs, which could be anywhere from one to four games (including the states). \nNelson was a freshman when Cummings was a senior and the duo worked closely together in that year, which Nelson credited for her growth on the field. \n“I was the only freshman that made varsity and I was very scared,” said Nelson. “I was shy, I didn't talk and I always felt like whenever we lost a game or something bad happened everyone thought 'She's only a freshman she shouldn't be on this team.' But Maddy was always pushing me to do better and I definitely looked up to her.” \n“Kylie is a great player and I am very proud to have someone with her dedication, commitment and love for the game break my records,” said Cummings, now a sophomore field hockey player for the University of Maine in Orono. “She is very hardworking and I could see that when she came in freshman year, so I took her under my wing and would work on certain skills and just kept making sure that she kept her head strong and focused. I am very proud of her and I hope she sets the bar high for the next player that strives to beat her record.” \nNelson said she often plays a “high forward” and is fed the ball by teammates on breakaways. She said teammate Kelsey Mehuren “puts me in these situations [to score] a lot.” \n“When she gets the ball she usually looks to throw an aerial to me or something,” said Nelson. \nNelson, who uses her tremendous quickness and stickwork to beat many defenders and, ultimately, goalies, already has drawn attention at the next level as colleges have begun to scout her, such as Providence College in Rhode Island. \nNelson said she is happy to put the records behind her and begin to focus on the team's Class B North playoff push.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:34:22.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
