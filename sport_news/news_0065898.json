Katina’s wearing a Louisville sweatshirt. She was part of the recruiting team, after all. The only way this picture could be any better is if Rod-Ni had written “L-Mo” in the caption instead.

If it was a booster, a mere slap on the wrist. If internal, (aka “Coach Mike”), BOOM goes the dynamite. leon singleton October 23, 2015 at 11:43 am | Permalink | Reply \nCome to Louisvill as a boy and leave as a man.

Jackie Childs October 23, 2015 at 11:58 am | Permalink | Reply \nThe stories keep swirling around but one angle no one has seemed to pursue is the benefit to UL and Pitino angle. People trying to shift all blame to McGee are calling him a rogue employee and equating his misdeeds to an employee that steals from the cash register. The problem with that analogy is that McGee helped UL recruit the best era in UL basketball in 30 years and got them multiple final fours and an NCAA title. Rick Pitino, U of L, Jurich, fans, Yum! Center, Bud Light etc etc – everyone benefited from UL’s surprise success once some of these recruits, alleged to have had sex with these girls, started playing for Rick. Rick just wants to know why it happened but are we to believe he never asked himself why are my recruits all of the sudden good enough to make my teams consistently be in the top 10 ??? WOW!!!

But her interview only helped uofl. Her story keeps changing. Scott Cox just came out and said McGee wasn’t even in town on the day she claims he told her Rick Knew. She said he told her in a hallway. Plus, she said Harell nailed her daughter on a recruiting visit. That was 2012. Yet, she claims her daughters didn’t get involved until 2013. I bet the uofl lawyers hope she does a couple more interviews. Wish she would stop while she is behind. The old lady said she has relations with Williams. He left in 09 and she said it didn’t start until 2010. Go Ahead October 23, 2015 at 12:47 pm | Permalink \nSure, you hate da tards. Doesn’t matter how many interviews she does. The program is going down in a heap, regardless.
