The Crimson Streaks will also be facing off against one of their own. \nGrant Barbour, a 2007 SJCC graduate who played quarterback for the Crimson Streaks as a junior and senior, now serves as a first-year defensive coordinator for Edgerton. Barbour and the Bulldogs (1-3 overall) visit SJCC (0-5) on Saturday for a 7 p.m. kickoff. \nIt will be the first time Barbour plays a game at Don Paul Stadium as the visitor. \n“It’ll be a little different for me being on the other sideline,” Barbour said. “I’ve never seen the view of a game on the field on that sideline so it’ll be different for me.” \nSince graduating SJCC, Barbour played three years of baseball at Defiance College also coached freshman football at Rossford in 2013 for former SJCC head coach Todd Drusback. He is in his second year as health and physical education teacher at Edgerton. He coached junior high football last year before taking over as varsity defensive coordinator this season. \nReturning to Fremont to face his alma mater makes Saturday night’s game a little different than most. \n“It’ll be fun, definitely, to go back there and coach against my old high school,” Barbour said. “I have to treat it like any other game but it won’t be just another game, it’s a little special. You want to win the game but it’s also hard coaching against your old high school.” \nBarbour holds the SJCC record for passing yards in a game, 452 vs. Carey in 2006. He is the only quarterback to have thrown for more than 400 yards in a single game, and he did so twice in his senior year. His 2,198 yards as a senior rank second all-time and third in single-season completions (140) and career touchdown passes (22). \nSaturday night, Barbour, whose parents, Rick and Kathy Barbour, still live in Fremont, expects a large group of family and friends to attend the game, even if they don’t all cheer for his Bulldogs. \n“My entire family went to St. Joe,” Barbour said. “…I know my dad did say, erven though I’m coaching Edgerton, he’s probably going to sit on the St. Joe sideline because it’s a better view from the higher stands, he did tell me that.” \nPutting on his defensive coordinator hat, Barbour said the Crimson Streaks will require his defense to play disciplined and not allow themselves to get so pulled into stopping the run that they forget about SJCC’s ability to throw. \n“We know we need to stop the run game but we’re also aware in certain situations we have to be ready for the pass,” he said. “They’re not a one-dimensional team. We know they rely on the run but we have to be prepared to stop both.” IF YOU GO Who: Edgerton (1-3 overall) at St. Joseph Central Catholic (0-5) \nWhat: SJCC faces former quarterback and 2007 graduate Grant Barbour, now the Edgerton defensive coordinator. \nWhere: Don Paul Stadium", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:04:08.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
