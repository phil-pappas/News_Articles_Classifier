He's now recovering in Los Angeles at an undisclosed location. His current condition was not clear.Eisenloffel said in an affidavit that eyewitnesses claim Odom was \"ingesting an unknown substance in the form of an unidentified pill, which he obtained from his pocket\" and that he \"possibly ingested cocaine\" after prostitutes \"heard him snorting.\"A 911 caller from the ranch claimed to police that Odom had been using cocaine and sexual enhancement drugs in the days leading up to his being found unconscious.Police also cited Odom's \"prior history of illicit narcotics use\" and that Odom's personal assistant indicated he \"has actually witnessed Mr. Odom under the influence of narcotics.\"Eisenloffel reiterated that when Odom was found, he had \"a white substance coming from his mouth as well as bleeding from his nose,\" which, from his training and experience, he recognized as evidence of an overdose.The two-time NBA Champion was first brought to a hospital in Las Vegas where he was in a coma for three days. Last Friday, he regained consciousness and opened his eyes. He was moved to an undisclosed location in Los Angeles earlier this week.His family released a statement on Tuesday, calling his progress nothing short of \"miraculous,\" adding he had even taken a \"few steps.\"\"We couldn't be more overjoyed! We realize Lamar's continued improvement will not be easy, however his unrelenting strength and faith in God will pull him through,\" the rep for the Odom family told ABC News. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
