That’s shortsighted.\" \nRELATED : PIAA Board of Directors vote in favor of expansion for football and more \nThe class expansion will be implemented for the 2016-17 season. \n\"I think it was inevitable,\" Easton football coach Steve Shiffert said shortly after the decision. \"The powers that be wanted Pennsylvania to be on par with other states with our number of high schools. It's going to give a lot more kids opportunities to play in state playoffs.\" \nOne of the arguments against the expansion was fear of watering down championships, but Hartman doesn’t believe that will be an issue for the people it affects the most. \n“The team who wins a AA championship isn’t upset they won because they didn’t win AAA,” Hartman said. “It’s a championship. They’re excited about it. There’s more opportunities for kids to play in meaningful championship games. \n“Kids don’t say it’s bad. Maybe people in the stands think it’s watering things down, but it tends to be an adult argument, not a kid argument. \n“I just don’t see how it can’t be good for schools in District 11. There are tons of benefits, really.” \nSports that combine team and individual tournaments, such as wrestling, swimming, golf, track and cross country, were not included in Wednesday’s vote. Bigger challenges exist in determining how that would play out, Hartman said, if the sports’ steering committees were even interested in doing so. \nThe wrestling steering committee was not interested in going to three classes, Hartman said. \nWhat lies ahead now is a sorting-out process, with the next step being to collect enrollment numbers for schools to see where they line up in the new system. Schools will then have until Dec. 15 to decide if they want to move up in class size. \nIf the vote for non-football sports had been pushed back, schools wouldn’t have had the opportunity to upgrade classes because the Board of Directors doesn’t meet until after the Dec. 15 deadline, Hartman said. \nBy Dec. 17, districts will get a breakdown of where their schools classify in each sport. Drafts of brackets will come out in January and districts will go from there figuring out how it affects their playoff structure. \nFor now, though, there is some closure to a move that has been a long time coming. \n“It’s probably a big day in Pennsylvania sports,” Hartman said. “Being a part of the change is neat to be a part of but it’s not without a lot of thought.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:11:22.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
