The second ended on a blocked 39-yard field goal attempt. The third drive ended on a missed 32-yard field goal try. \n\"We knew we had to come out hard. We [the defense] wanted to put the team on our back and make plays,\" Williams said. \"We want to get back to winning, so this game was big.\" \nOn the very next drive after Williams' pick-6, the Chargers' Yusef Hollingsworth intercepted a deep pass at his own 10-yard line. Hollingsworth also recorded a sack on the following series - setting the stage for a half in which the Chargers defense allowed just two first downs. \nTimber Creek tacked on an insurance touchdown with 6:54 left in the game - a 15-yard pass from Devin Leary to Noah Ellison - marking one of the game's few offensive highlights. \nKingsway 0 0 0 0 - 0 \nTimber Creek 0 0 7 7 - 14 \nTC: Tyreek Williams 36 interception return (Tyler Coluccio kick) \nTC: Noah Ellison 15 pass from Devin Leary (Coluccio kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:07:03.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
