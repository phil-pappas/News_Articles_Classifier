He played through the injury in Week 3, but coach Pete Carroll said an MRI following that game revealed damage in Lynch’s hamstring.\nIn Lynch’s absence, rookie running back Thomas Rawls rushed for 217 yards on 40 carries, scoring one touchdown. Rawls’s performance left Carroll hoping to be able to continue using him in games after Lynch’s return.\n“Normally, Marshawn comes in and out pretty regularly, so we’ll just pump [Rawls] in there and see how many carries that amounts to,” Carroll said. “Usually it’s about eight or 10 carries on a regular game. We’ll see how that goes. …\n“We’re going to feel real comfortable about him in the two spot, coming in off the bench. There’s no reason for him not to play, he’s done a great job for us, and I would say he’s probably exceeded our expectations at this point.”\nThe Seahawks (2–3) host the Panthers (4–0) on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET.\n- Erin Flynn\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/", "http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/03/seattle-seahawks-marshawyn-lynch-pete-carroll-hamstring-injury-damage", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/seahawks-marshawn-lynch-expected-to-return-sunday-vs-panthers/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:47:53.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
