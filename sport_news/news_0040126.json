He missed his first four field goals to start the season, then made five straight, but missed two in a row Saturday before making a 35-yarder. Alabama coach Nick Saban addresses media after Saturday night's 27-14 win over Arkansas. Duane Rankin/Montgomery Advertiser \nAlabama is good enough to stay in College Football Playoff contention. Its defensive front seven is stern, and the secondary seems to be improving each week. Plus running back Derrick Henry is always a threat for the big play, but he can also wear defenses down. \nHowever, they have holes in its offensive line, kicking game is suspect and Coker could have that bad game against a great team, and the Tide find itself on the losing end of a nail-biter. Scoring just three points in a half won't cut in future games. \n\"We've got to learn to be more consistent,\" Saban said after Saturday's game. \"When we're focused, when we prepare well and we're focused, we seem to play really well.\" \nSaban said the Tide have many more \"challenges\" ahead. The next one is on the horizon. \nThe Crimson Tide travel to College Station next week facing unbeaten Texas A&M, which is on a bye. The No. 9 Aggies (5-0, 2-0) don't play on offense. They mean business and can put up huge numbers. \nAlabama barely survived the last time they played in Kyle Field. The Aggies don't have Johnny Manziel, but the offense is just as explosive and the defense is much improved. \nSo Saban could lose some years on his life as he admitted to doing so in 2013 and this time, leave College Station with a loss that will discontinue the Tide's title hopes. \nEvery team has weaknesses, but their strengths are so strong, you don't notice the flaws or care about them because they aren't alarming enough to cost you the game. Alabama's defense is the team's super strength that can flat out make your life miserable on offense. \nJust ask Alex Collins. \nHe came into the game the nation's eighth leading rusher, going for 150-plus yards in his last three games. How many did he manage Saturday? \nTwenty-six. \n\"We probably have the best front seven in the nation,\" Alabama junior safety Eddie Jackson said. \nThe Tide's secondary seems to be finding its comfort zone, particularly Jackson. The former cornerback has two interceptions in his last two games. He gives the secondary another guy with a corner mentality. \nAs good as its defense is, Alabama has been inconsistent offensively. You want to point all fingers at Coker as he threw two interceptions and made some more ill-advised throws Saturday night. \nHell, even Coker is pointing the finger at himself. \n\"I just got to do a better job of getting the ball out quick and making sure I do my job because in that first half, most of it was really on me,\" said Coker, who finished 24 of 33 for 262 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. \"I just got to pick it up.\" \nHowever, he's changed in this sense. Coker no longer gives off bad body language as he did earlier this season. He now will fight back, compete and hang in there when things going south. \nIt is then he'll scramble for a first down. \n\"The resiliency that he shows out there,\" Tide center Ryan Kelly said. \"He's always trying to get the first down or as many yards as he can. It's probably every game he's been able to do something with his feet so I guess he's turning into a dual-threat quarterback. \n\"Who knows, but he's a great team player, and we love him for it.\" \nIt is then when he'll hang in that pocket even after his offensive line has let him down and deliver a perfect bomb to Ridley for a 81-yard touchdown that gave the Tide a 17-7 lead late in the third quarter. \nRidley finished with nine catches for 140 yards to post his second straight 100-yard, one touchdown game. At 20 years old, he's not your normal freshman, but Ridley is a star. \nStill, the only thing is what will happen when the Tide defense gives up points as it likely will next week? Can Coker avoid those mistakes to keep his defense from facing a short field all day? That is the question he will one day have to answer and that may come as early as next week. \nThen there's Griffith. This guy is as up and down as Six Flags over any state the amusement park is located. Alabama's offense better find consistency and its defense better stay consistent because if it comes down to Griffith to win a game, the odds say he'll push the ball wide right, left or fall short. \nAlabama has one of nation's top teams, but it has a small margin for error, too. That will cost the Crimson Tide if their weaknesses don't become less glaring. \nDuane Rankin , Advertiser columnist, can be followed on Twitter @DuaneRankin or reached at dmrankin@ gannett.com.
