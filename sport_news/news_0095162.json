But in the good years and the bad, through thick and thin, the bullpen was always the biggest source of trouble.\nConsider this: According to research conducted by FanGraphs, the Tigers have had the worst bullpen in the majors since 2003. They rank 28th in walk rate (3.9 per nine innings), 29th in ERA (4.23) and dead last in strikeout rate (7.1 per nine innings), most of which occurred on Dombrowski’s watch.\nAnd so, as the Red Sox president of baseball operations braces for his first offseason with his new team, rearming the bullpen will pose every bit as big a challenge as higher-profile items on his to-do list, namely acquiring a proven No. 1 starter and figuring out what to do with position-less slugger Hanley Ramirez.\n“You’re always learning, you’re always evaluating,” Dombrowski said yesterday when asked if years of trial and error have given him a better understanding of what it takes to build a good bullpen. “I don’t know that I would get into specific lessons learned, but I think you’re really talking about depth at times. The problem is, sometimes you have to make determinations about cost factors and where you spend your dollars. If you spend your dollars in other places, sometimes it’s not available to spend (in the bullpen).”\nWith the Tigers, Dombrowski was rarely shy about spending big money on free agent relievers. In 2006, he signed 38-year-old closer Todd Jones to a two-year, $11 million contract. Four years later, he forked over $14 million for two seasons of Jose Valverde. In 2011, it was Joaquin Benoit, a set-up man who got a three-year, $16.5 million deal and ended up closing games in 2013. And two years ago, Dombrowski signed 39-year-old six-time All-Star Joe Nathan to a two-year, $20 million deal.\nJones and Valverde had their moments, though both managed to raise the heart rate of then-Tigers manager Jim Leyland. Benoit was mostly effective, at least until he gave up David Ortiz’ legendary grand slam in Game 2 of the 2013 AL Championship Series. Nathan has been an unmitigated train wreck. He notched a 4.81 ERA and blew seven saves last year, then missed almost all of this season with a torn ligament in his right elbow.\nPart of the problem for Dombrowski has been the maddening inconsistency that is typical for most relief pitchers. This year’s best relievers are often next year’s busts, and it’s the executive who can best predict the ups and downs that winds up with the best bullpen.\n“I think you have to be aware of the volatility and what do you think causes the volatility, and each and every situation probably is somewhat different,” Dombrowski said. “I think you need to do your homework however you can to find out as much information as you possibly can. I think everybody has certain factors that you’d look and analyze those factors, and hopefully the decisions you make turn out to be right rather than wrong.”\nThe Sox have an incumbent closer, but Koji Uehara will turn 41 in April and is coming off a fractured right wrist that sidelined him since early August. Set-up man Junichi Tazawa was shut down last month, clearly fatigued after making more than 200 appearances over the past three seasons.\nFor the past month, the Sox have saved the highest-leverage situations for young relievers, including lefty Robbie Ross Jr., Noe Ramirez and Heath Hembree, in the hopes of making evaluations. But regardless of their performances, Dombrowski will need to make additions from outside the organization.\nOne area in which the Red Sox are especially deficient: Hard-throwers. There aren’t any high-90s radar-gun readings in the bunch, no one resembling the Yankees’ Dellin Betances or the Royals’ Kelvin Herrera.\n“Power (arms) used to be 95. Now, when you see power, you’re seeing guys that are throwing 97, 98, 99,” Dombrowski said. “And then there’s the ability to use a secondary pitch or so. You come out of New York and see the power that, let’s say (Andrew) Miller has, or that Betances has, but they also have a secondary pitch that’s good. I think all people would love to have power, but there’s also more elements than just throwing hard.”\nThe Red Sox need to find as many pitchers with as many of those elements as possible.\nGiven his track record, consider it perhaps Dombrowski’s greatest challenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:40:14.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
