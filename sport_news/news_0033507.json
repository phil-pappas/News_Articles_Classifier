But any idea of a fight back by the Cameroonians was quelled in the 65th minute when Bortey curled in a neat cross from the edge of the box from a free kick straight into the net after Adjah Tetteh had been brought down for the fourth goal. \nHearts brought on Emmanuel Osei Kuffour for Francis Bossman in the 72nd minute and the effect was \nimmediate when Tagoe found himself unmarked in the Batie goal area to tap in a corner kick expertly taken by Amankwah Mireku. \nTagoe gave way for Ablade Morgan in the 77th minute, and the substitute also came very close in the 78th and 81st minutes but for some daring saves by the Batie goalkeeper to end the exciting game 5-1 in favour of Hearts. \nHearts Oak progressed in the Confederations Cup and eventually won the maiden edition by beating their bitterest rivals Asante Kotoko on a penalty shootout. \nLine Up.
