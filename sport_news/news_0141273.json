The national spotlight will be on No. 7 and unbeaten Michigan State and No. 14 Michigan, which has shut out its last three opponents, as ESPN's GameDay selection, not to mention the Big Ten East Division implications involved.\nThe Wolverines steered clear of saying anything controversial about the Spartans during the weekly news conference on Monday, mirroring head coach Jim Harbaugh, who consistently rules out making comparisons to previous teams or looking back at the past.\nStill, for the players from the state, winning this game is a top priority.\nDETROIT NEWS\nJabrill Peppers: Sky's the limit for Michigan defense\n\"I think you always remember it, it would be lying to say you don't remember it because you read it and everything like that,\" Morgan, a fifth-year senior from Holland, Mich., said, referring to the physical nature with which MSU has played Michigan the last several years. \"Do we thrive on it? No. We know what kind of program they have, we know they're a good football team that deserves respect, but we're excited.\n\"It's a big game. There's no question it's a rivalry. Taking it personally? Yeah, I'm a kid from the state of Michigan. I know what this game is, I know how important it is, and it's definitely something that's personal.\"\nHarbaugh praised Michigan State but said there's no way to make bigger a game that has always been meaningful for Michigan and Michigan State. He has maintained each and every week that the team has focused on the next game and nothing beyond.\n\"We've been going about our business at Schembechler Halll,\" Harbaugh said. \"I'm sure that there will be a lot of attempts made to make it ... but it's already big. The game is big enough. Fair, healthy, honest competition with a heck of a good opponent. That's enough.\"\nWhen asked what the rivalry means, Harbaugh described as a \"trophy game,\" adding the goal is always to win the most awards, and a trophy is, of course, an award.\nHarbaugh has made movie references each of the last four weeks, and Monday was no different. He drew upon the \"Lion King\" when responding to a question about the physical nature with which Michigan State has controlled the series under coach Mark Dantonio.\n\"Think about the Lion King,\" Harbaugh said. \"Simba gets hit over the head and tells him, 'Yeah, the past can hurt. You can either run from it or embrace it and learn from it,' I think is exactly what he said. So, those seem like very wise words.\"\nLater, Harbaugh, while declining to really answer a question about when he played in the rivalry while at Michigan, asked to clarify who actually made that comment in the movie to Simba.\n\"Who said that? Rafiki? Rafiki?,\" Harbaugh said, his smile broadening. \"Wise words.\"\nStribling available\nHarbaugh said cornerback Channing Stribling, who did not play last Saturday against Northwestern, will be available for the MSU game. His injury was not disclosed.\n\"He was very, very close this past weekend,\" Harbaugh said. \"He could have played, but I thought it was more prudent to not play him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:49:28.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
