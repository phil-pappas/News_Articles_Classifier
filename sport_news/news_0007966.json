It will close for about a week later this month for the remodel. \nNew executive chef Josh Spisak is continuing Lacey's vision of more seafood and other experimental dishes, said Chris's mother Lisa Lacey. \n\"Chris wouldn't have wanted us to just walk away,\" she said. \nLacey died unexpectedly in his sleep in July 2014, and an exact cause of death was never determined. \nThe restaurant also is getting an interior makeover, with brighter colors to replace the traditional steakhouse look of dark woods. \nWant to try something new?
