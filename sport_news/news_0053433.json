Television replays showed he clearly used his hand to score. \nGermany international Zieler, battling to keep his spot in the national team amid growing competition, then came to the rescue on half a dozen occasions to deny Cologne an equaliser. \nHe left his best saves for last, twice denying Anthony Modeste in the final minutes when he first palmed the Frenchman's header over the bar and then stopped a low drive with the last kick of the game. \nHanover, who had lost five of their opening seven matches with coach Michael Frontzeck under mounting pressure, moved out of the bottom spots with their first away win of the campaign and into 14th on eight points. \nVfB Stuttgart climbed out of last place with a 1-0 victory over promoted Ingolstadt but were left with 10 men when Geoffrey Serey Die was sent off late in the game. Stuttgart's second win of the season moved them into 15th, a point behind Hanover. \nBayern Munich remained seven points clear at the top after their 1-0 victory at Werder Bremen on Saturday to set a Bundesliga record for the best start with their ninth consecutive victory. \nBorussia Dortmund scored their first win in four matches when they beat Mainz 05 2-0 on Friday to stay in second place on 20 points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:46:55.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
