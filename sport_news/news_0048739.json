Hale excelling along Cardinals' defensive front 1 / 6 Back to Gallery \nDuring Lamar football's first scrimmage of the 2015 season, Larance Hale became best friends with the sideline trash can. \nHale puked for minutes on end, depositing the morning's meal while the rest of the Cardinals continued to scrimmage. \n\"I can honestly say that's just me,\" Hale said. \"Sometimes I just go too hard and my insides can't take it. I feel like I'm lazy sometimes so I just try to push myself to that point of no return.\" \nHale's puking tendency has proven grossly invaluable for Lamar this season. \nHale, a junior defensive lineman, leads the Cardinals in tackles for loss (six) despite starting only two of four games in his first season since transferring from Southern Arkansas University . \nHale has been deemed the 'loose screw' of the defensive line by senior linebacker Ronnie Jones . \n\"We joke about being a loose screw and that's what I am,\" Hale said. \"You've got those players that are quiet and mild-mannered, then you've got those players who are loose screws out the joint and that's what I am. Coach says we need guys like that and I'm the loose screw for the defensive line.\" \nBeing a loose screw on the Lamar defense entails three duties --- rile up the Cardinal defense through verbal communication, rile up opposing offenses with trash talk and give it your all on every play despite exhaustion. \nHale has performed those duties with ease, which has earned the notice of defensive line coach Carey Bailey . \n\"(Larance) is definitely an extrovert,\" Bailey said. \"He's like nobody else I know. He's just Larance. That's the best way I can describe him. As for the puking, that's just his thing.\" \nBailey is impressed with Hale's on-field abilities, too. \n\"(Larance) is athletic and has a different kind of skill set,\" Bailey said. \"He has great feet and really can get off blocks. He's definitely a piece we've been glad to have.\" \nCardinals coach Ray Woodard made Hale a captain for the Southeastern Louisiana game, which Woodard said was a long time coming. \n\"(Larance) was the best scout team guy in the conference last year,\" Woodard said. \"He's really come on and helped us. He's a heck of a player but his best play is still ahead of him.\" \nFor now, Hale is trying to stomach the success he and Lamar have had this season. \n\"It's fun because that intensity and throwing your body around is what it's all about,\" Hale said. \"Sometimes you mess up but that's just part of being a loose screw. We're going to talk a little smack and get into some scuffles but that's just what a loose screw does. I love it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:55:07.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
