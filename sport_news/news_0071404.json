These challenges in the Colonial Athletic Association must be met head-on. “You can’t shy away from it, because it’s an opportunity,” Jackson said. “We’re not oblivious to how good they are. We know they’re good. But why not us? Why can’t we beat the ranked teams you’re going to play in this league week in and week out? There’s no need to shy away from it.” The Phoenix meets Richmond today in a road game that marks Elon’s second of three straight matchups against conference opponents who reside among the Top 20 in the Football Championship Subdivision. Once nationally ranked for 33 consecutive weeks from October 2007 to September 2010, Elon since has fallen flat in assignments with ranked FCS teams, losing 22 of its last 24 such games. Elon will enter Robins Stadium, Richmond’s on-campus stadium that the Phoenix helped christen five years ago, having lost 13 games in a row against ranked opponents. That registers as a displeasing trend, obviously, and especially because defeating Top-25 teams is a requirement for finding success in the deep and balanced CAA, which Elon joined last year. “To me, it doesn’t get better,” Elon coach Rich Skrosky said. “That’s why you come here. You want to play the type of schedule we’re going to play. “You’ve got to take it as an opportunity to do something special, and Richmond presents that. But we can’t just say that. We’ve got to play an A-game to be able to have a chance to win.” The preparation for Richmond started on a promising note this week. Skrosky said given the energy and tempo at work, Tuesday might have produced Elon’s best practice of the regular season. Elon’s typically reliable defense is coming off an out-of-character performance after being hit with a five-touchdown blitz of 34 points — linebacker Corey Mitchell blocked an extra-point kick following the third score — during the first 25½ minutes last week at New Hampshire. It took New Hampshire only four plays to score on Elon. By midway through the first quarter, the Phoenix trailed 14-0 and the deficit grew to 20-0 before the second quarter arrived. “I think we’ve just got to go back to the basics, go back to the things we know how to do well,” Jackson said. “Early on when things got out of hand (against New Hampshire), I think we kind of panicked a little bit.” Page 2 of 2 - What Richmond’s offense delivered last week in a 48-17 rout of Maine isn’t encouraging. The Spiders needed just five plays and less than two minutes to bolt to a 14-0 lead on Kyle Lauletta’s touchdown passes of 27 yards and 75 yards to Reggie Diggs and Brian Brown, respectively, a pair of standout receivers. Lauletta, a sophomore, went on to throw for career highs of 311 yards and four scores as Richmond put up at least 42 points for the second week in a row. While Jackson said the Spiders have “obviously the best offensive line we’re going to play all year,” Skrosky furthered the notion by saying Richmond appears to be the most explosive offense Elon has encountered this season. “They have great diversity in their skill,” Skrosky said. “They’re very multiple in personnel groupings. They’re very balanced. They’re committed to running the ball and play action. I like what they do on offense. “We’ve got our hands full. They’re hitting on all cylinders. (Last week) was by far their most complete game in every phase of the game.” Elon (2-3, 1-1) at No. 16 Richmond (3-1, 1-0) Kickoff: 3:30 p.m. today Radio: WSML-FM 104.5, WSML-AM 1200 Where: Robins Stadium (capacity 8,700), Richmond, Va.
