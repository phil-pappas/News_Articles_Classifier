PV’s biggest challenge will be taking the teeth out of North Jersey’s most productive offense. The Indians, whose nine-game winning streak is the best current run in North Jersey, beat the NV/Old Tappan twice last season. The pick: Pascack Valley \nNo. 4 Don Bosco (3-2) at No. 4 Passaic Tech (5-0), 7 \nStory line: The unbeaten Bulldogs have allowed just 17 points in five games, but their defense will face its most daunting assignment of the season against a program that has outscored Passaic Tech, 215-22, in four meetings since 2009. Don Bosco will try to bounce back from its stunning, 19-16 home loss to Paramus Catholic on the final play a week ago. That loss broke a three-game winning streak. \nThe pick: Don Bosco \nNo. 13 Indian Hills (4-1) at No. 6 Ramapo (5-1), 6 \nStory line: Can Indian Hills, one of the best stories of the season, bounce back after last week’s loss to NV/Old Tappan? Ramapo, led by Lehigh-bound senior QB Keith Woetzel, is playing as well as any team in North Jersey right now. A win will go a long way toward earning the Green Raiders a North 1, Group 3 home playoff game. The pick: Ramapo \nNo. 16 Paramus (3-2) at No. 10 Ridgewood (4-1), 7 \nStory line: This could be the defining moment in the Spartans’ race for a North 1, Group 3 playoff spot. They did not play last week and have a tough Wayne Hills team on deck, so they need to score an upset on the road against a team that has won four straight since an opening day loss. The pick: Paramus \nNo. 14 Waldwick/Midland Park (4-1) at Garfield (4-1), 7 \nStory line: A share, at least, of first place in the NJIC Colonial Division is at stake with both teams tied with Rutherford at 3-0. Garfield has something to prove after last week’s stunning loss to Lyndhurst. There also is pressure on the Warriors, who had to work quite hard to beat Lodi last week. \nThe pick: Waldwick/Midland Park \nCresskill (3-2) at No. 18 Park Ridge (5-0), 7 \nStory line: The Owls continue their push for an NJIC Meadowlands Division title against a Cresskill team that has two losses by a combined seven points. This is a big game for the Cougars because they sit in ninth place in a very competitive North 1, Group 1 playoff race. The Owls haven’t beaten Cresskill since the 2008 season opener. The pick: Cresskill \nNo. 5 DePaul (1-4) at Poly Prep, N.Y. (4-1), 7 \nStory line: DePaul has lost four straight since its season-opening shutout of Pope John, including back-to-back defeats to Canisius Prep (N.Y.) and Bergen Catholic by a combined five points. The Spartans would qualify for the Non-Public Group 3 playoffs if the season ended today, yet have to win this difficult game in Brooklyn to begin reestablishing some confidence before road games against Elder (Ohio) and Paramus Catholic. \nThe pick: DePaul \nKennedy (2-4) at Clifton (2-1-1), 7 \nStory line: Kennedy snapped a four-game losing streak by beating Passaic, 40-6, a week ago and moved back into contention for a North 1, Group 5 playoff berth. The Knights need to win on the road tonight, though, to strengthen their chances of securing one of eight berths in their section. Clifton, which hasn’t reached the playoffs since 2008, also must win this Big North non-division game to keep pace in the North 1, Group 5 power-point standings. \nThe pick: Clifton \nSATURDAY \nHasbrouck Heights (4-1) at No. 6 St. Mary (5-0), 1 \nStory line: The Gaels, led by senior RB Derius Stone, have scored at least 22 points in every game. That makes a huge challenge for a Heights defense that has been one of the best in North Jersey while posting three shutouts and allowing 4.6 points per game. \nThe pick: St. Mary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:32:45.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
