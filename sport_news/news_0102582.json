Westbrook and co-driver Michael Valiante lead the Prototype standings by six points over defending champions Christian Fittipaldi and Joao Barbosa. \n\"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't nice to get a pole, but with a 10-hour race it's not as important,\" said Westbrook, who also will be joined by Mike Rockenfeller in the No. 90 entry. \"There was a lot of moisture out there. Everyone was getting faster each lap so it was very important to keep going right until the end.\" \nFittipaldi will start from the outside front row in the No. 5 Mustang Sampling Corvette DP. IndyCar veteran Sebastian Bourdais will join Fittipaldi and Barbosa. \nJoey Hand was third in Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates' No. 01 Ford EcoBoost/Riley that he will share with Scott Pruett and IndyCar champion Scott Dixon. \nTom Kimber-Smith earned his first pole of the season in the Prototype Challenge class, running 1:32.378 (98.985 mph) in the No. 52 Cuttwood/Spyder ORECA FLM09 he will drive along with Mike Guasch and Andrew Palmer. \nEarl Bamber qualified on the pole in GTLM class, but will start at the back following a chassis change. Cameron Lawrence earned the top spot in the GTD class. \nChristina Nielsen, a point ahead in the GTD standings, will start eighth in her attempt to become the first female champion ever in national American sports car racing. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:30:17.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
