Three teams comprising six EPF inspectors raided the premises and took records in their custody. They also sought additional records from the factory owners within three days. These teams were led by Assistant Commissioner (EPF) Jai Shankar Prasad and the units raided were Jai Mata Plywood, Ambica Traders and KTM Plywood in and around Baghpur village on the Hoshiarpur-Dasuya road. It was found that many of the workers, who were seen working there, were not mentioned in records submitted to the organisation and there were huge evasions of EPF payments. Prasad told The Tribune that all the three units had been evading payments for long. “To Evade the EPF payments, they have mentioned only 25 to 30 workers in their records submitted to EPF but it was found that each of them was having more than 100 workers in the units. The number of workers at KTM was found to be more than 200 against the reported 25,” said Prasad. He said it would take time to determine the exact amount of evasions but primary investigation of records and the physical checks in the factories revealed that there were evasions of huge amounts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:23:01.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
