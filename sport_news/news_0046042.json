Trump on the presidential campaign trail as a way to lead cheers for the United States national team.\nContinue reading the main story (2/2) Well, now watch this Trump pump up video for the #USMNT ! Get ready. #USAvMEX kicks tomorrow on @FS1 ! https://t.co/1mfnfZiqTo\n— FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) Oct. 9, 2015 The video was promoted as a response to an earlier TV Azteca ad that used Trump’s words as a way to promote Mexico in the game. But Fox’s choice of Trump to promote the United States team seemed, at best, questionable. He has built his campaign for president around anti-immigration positions, especially those from Mexico, and has described Mexicans who have entered the United States illegally as rapists and criminals.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Javier Hernández Brims With Confidence as Mexico Prepares to Face U.S. OCT. 8, 2015 In Case Against Soccer Officials, U.S. Paints FIFA as the Victim OCT. 9, 2015 Sports of The Times: With or Without Its Captain, FIFA Seems to Be Capsizing OCT. 8, 2015 Sepp Blatter and Other Top Officials Are Suspended, Deepening FIFA’s Turmoil OCT. 8, 2015 The FIFA Scandal: Questions and Answers OCT. 8, 2015 In the video, interspersed with clips of the United States and Mexican teams in action, Trump is seen saying, “Our country has tremendous people, tremendous potential,” “these are the best and the finest,” and “bigger, better and stronger, and we will make American great again.” He is also Quote: d saying, “I love the Mexican people,” and “they have amazing spirit.”\nFox’s use of Trump to promote the match prompted a quick and mostly negative response on Twitter, with people objecting not only to Trump but to the politicizing of the match. The current United States team includes several Mexican-American players, and immigrants have played a role in its success throughout its history.\nThe main American fan group, the American Outlaws, tweeted a one-word response to the video almost immediately: No . But others soon piled on.\nContinue reading the main story I don't think Fox understands the demographics of the American soccer-watching public.\n— Travis Waldron (@Travis_Waldron) Oct. 9, 2015 Continue reading the main story Besides highly doubting he really supports the NTs, he has spouted gross racist invective against Mexicans.

We’ve come too far to stoop to this.\n— herculez gomez (@herculezg) Oct. 9, 2015 A Fox spokesman was not immediately available for comment.\nThe United States will face Mexico on Saturday night at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. The match is a one-game playoff to select the country that will represent Concacaf, the regional confederation that includes North and Central American and the Caribbean, in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia. That tournament is considered an important dress rehearsal for the 2018 World Cup.\nLoading... Go to Home Page »\nSite Index The New York Times News World U.S. Politics N.Y.
