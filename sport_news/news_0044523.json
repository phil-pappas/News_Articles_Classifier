(AP) - Republican White House hopefuls Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Carly Fiorina are appearing at a New Hampshire forum on limiting the powers of the federal government.\nThe American Principles Project is hosting the forum Saturday in Hooksett. Conservative advocacy group Cornerstone Action is co-hosting the event. Speakers at the event, including the presidential candidates, will discuss ways for voters to fight back against the federal government. Topics up for discussion include the Common Core education standards, U.S. monetary policy and New Hampshire politics.\nNeither Cruz, a Texas senator, nor Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, have spent much time campaigning in New Hampshire as they seek the GOP nomination. Fiorina, a former business executive, continues to visit frequently and roll out endorsements here.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
