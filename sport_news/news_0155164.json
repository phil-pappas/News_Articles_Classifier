Hextall has depth on his side and would like to get some salary cap relief and clear up a spot before opening night rosters are due Tuesday evening. \nSo far there haven’t been any bites. \nHextall would rather not lose another player to waivers as he did Thursday when the Minnesota Wild picked up Chris Porter. He’d prefer to make a trade. \n“Probably, but that’s not something that you can make happen,” the general manager said. “Part of the good problem we have is we have depth. It’s a tough decision here. You expose certain guys to waivers, do they get claimed? Do you send a young guy down just because you don’t have a spot? It’s a tough one. We’ll sift through everything and come up with a decision.” \nTechnically Hextall’s roster stands at 26 — 15 forwards, eight defensemen and three goalies — but forward Colin McDonald cleared waivers, so he can be sent to the minors easily and same for goalie Jason LaBarbera, who has been around in case Michal Neuvirth needs a day off to rest his “lower-body injury.” \nHe has a tough decision to make on the last one, the one that would get the roster down to 23, the maximum limit, by Tuesday. It appears as though center Scott Laughton is someone the Flyers want to keep around and that he’ll play every day rather than sit as an extra forward. \n“Scotty has done everything that we have asked of him, coming to camp in really good shape, play well, play hard, play your game,” Hextall said. “He’s done a good job. He’s done what we expected him to do.” \nThe irony is that sending Laughton, who is not subject to waivers, to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms may be the best move in terms of asset management. Loaning the 21-year-old 2012 first-round pick to the Phantoms would also mean keeping eight defensemen on the roster, which is certainly not ideal. \n“If there’s eight guys and you’re the eighth guy, you’re still not playing, right? You’re hanging around with the NHL guys but you’re still not playing,” said Brandon Manning, one of the eight who all have one-way contracts. \nHextall would prefer to have seven defensemen on the roster anyway. Not counting LaBarbera, McDonald or Laughton, the Flyers have roughly $583,000 in salary cap space, barely enough for one call-up. \nThe plan is for the final decision to come Saturday, after the preseason finale Friday night in Newark. But if there are still no trading partners, Hextall will have to send someone else to the waiver wire. \nHe’s still holding out hope it doesn’t come to that, but if it does he has the depth to withstand potentially losing another player for nothing in return. \n“(Depth) is a good thing and you’re gonna need it at some point,” Hextall said, “so at this point I have a couple ideas on what we’re going to do, but we’ll see what happens (Friday) and go from there. It’s not an easy decision whichever way we go. The people that are possible to go down, those guys have pushed us. That’s gonna be a tough decision but we’ve got a couple ideas. We’ll see what happens (Friday) night.” Raffl improving, Couturier hopes to play \nMichael Raffl and Sean Couturier, both dealing with “upper-body injuries” were the only two players on the ice Thursday, as a scheduled practice was cancelled. \nCouturier said he plans to take part in Friday’s morning skate and hopes to play in the preseason finale against the New Jersey Devils while Raffl is already deemed out, but feels like he’s getting better. \n“I had a 40-minute bag skate and I feel pretty good,” Raffl said, “so I’m good to go, yeah.” \nBoth should be available next Thursday when the Flyers open the regular season in Tampa. Loose pucks \nThe guest for Tuesday’s episode of the Loose Pucks podcast will be Lightning beat reporter Joe Smith of the Tampa Bay Times. … Wednesday night the Lehigh Valley Phantoms lost their first preseason game to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins 4-3. Their next game will be in Allentown, Pa. Saturday against the Hartford Wolf Pack. \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com . 2 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1KPDL76 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:37:43.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
