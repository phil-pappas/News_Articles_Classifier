The Canadians’ evening worsened as captain Tyler Ardron had to go off with a knee injury. \nThe French did not have to wait long to add to their tally. Hooker Guilhem Guirado bundled over with Michalak adding the extras for 17-0. \nThe Canadians struck back almost immediately. French debutant Remy Grosso was beaten in the air and the ball was eventually worked brilliantly out to the other wing where DTH van der Merwe used his speed to outpace the defence and touch down. \nThe Canadians got their second when hooker Aaron Carpenter planted the ball on the line to make it 17-12. \nThe French pulled themselves together and responded with a try two minutes from the break, the ball worked by Bernard Le Roux to lock Pascal Pape for prop Rabah Slimani to finish it off. \nThey grabbed their bonus point fourth try when Pape squeezed the ball through a mass of bodies and Michalak converted for 34-18 with 13 minutes remaining. \nThe Canadians tired and saw replacement Nanyak Dala Bieng sin-binned as the game entered the final 10 minutes. \nThe one man advantage worked for Grosso who went in at the far left hand corner to mark his debut with a try.
