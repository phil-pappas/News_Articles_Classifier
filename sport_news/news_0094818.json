I don’t think we’re giving it away. You’re just going to see how this process actually works.” \nWWE opened a $2.5 million, 26,000-square foot facility in 2013 in Orlando, Florida, and made Full Sail University the home of a revamped version of the “NXT” series on the WWE Network. NXT has served as WWE’s minor leagues and showcases both up-and-comers such as Tyler Breeze, Finn Balor and Bayley with independent wrestling stalwarts like Samoa Joe. \nBreeze - a pretty boy with a selfie gimmick - will be one of the featured talents on “Breaking Ground.” \n“It’s not about NXT,” Dunn said. “It’s about making it to the WWE.” \nWWE’s latest show offers a backstage pass in how wrestlers hone their craft in the ring and how top executives like Triple H and NXT trainers evaluate talent as they try to restock the main roster. \n“I think new is always interesting on any level, especially when you have new stars on any TV show,” Dunn said. \nThe WWE Network boasts 1.2 million subscribers at $9.99 a month as of July 30. The network airs 12 pay-per-view events and “Breaking Ground” will make a sneak peek on Sunday night following the “Hell in the Cell” telecast. \nWWE’s flagship “Raw” show has relied on aging stalwarts like Cena, Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker to sell Sunday’s show and veterans “Stone Cold” Steve Austin and Ric Flair were rolled out for Monday’s show. \nWWE wants to hook viewers on the next generation of stars who may reach WrestleMania. Unlike WWE’s reality show “Tough Enough,” the NXT stars aren’t competing for a contract, just a spot on the main roster. \nDunn said “Tough Enough’s” return was uncertain. \n3 Ball Entertainment will co-produce the original series. Shatner has had a long affiliation with WWE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:35:03.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
