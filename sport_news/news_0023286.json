The Norsemen spoiled PCM’s Senior Night, rallying from an 0-2 deficit to win in five sets. By Troy Hyde Newton Daily News \nMONROE — Things went pretty well for Prairie City-Monroe’s volleyball team during the first two sets of a Heart of Iowa Conference match with Roland-Story on Thursday night. \nUnfortunately, it takes three set wins to claim a victory and the Norse got things together quick enough to rally for the 22-25, 21-25, 25-16, 25-13, 15-7 victory. \nRoland-Story spoiled the Mustangs’ Senior Night. \nPCM recognized its eight seniors before the match, and that may have helped the Mustangs get off to a fast start. \nUnfortunately, Roland-Story grabbed a little momentum in the third set and never looked back. \n“They got a little bit frustrated with themselves when Roland-Story came out hard in the third set,” PCM coach Krystal Ehn said. \n“They have to learn to fight through that. The other teams will come us hard when they are down 0-2. We have to learn to come back even harder.” \nThe Mustangs (8-23) could have pulled into a tie with the Norse (15-13) in the HOIC standings. Instead, Roland-Story improves to 4-4 in league play, while PCM drops to 2-6. \nPCM took the first two sets after pulling away late both times. \nThe Mustangs had to rally from an early deficit in the opener. They trailed 8-3 and didn’t take control until back-to-back kills by Ashley Van Gorp and Kaylee Townsend made it 14-12. Townsend and Van Gorp each collected another kill a few points later to keep the advantage at two, \nThe Norse regained the lead for a moment, but PCM broke away from a 20-all tie to claim a 24-20 lead and won by three. \nThe second set started about the same as the opener did. Neither team had much of an advantage until the Mustangs claimed six straight points to go up 17-13. That run included a Townsend ace, a Mackenzie Messick kill and a Messick block. \nThe lead grew to as much as six before an ace by Kayla Jennings finished things off. \n“They wanted it bad,” Ehn said. “It was Senior Night and they wanted to come out and do our thing and show everyone how good we are and they just came out on fire. They didn’t match their fire.” \nUnfortunately, the momentum of two straight wins wasn’t enough for the home team. There were 10 ties in the third set before Roland-Story rolled off four straight points to gain an advantage and the Norse cruised from there. \nRoland-Story jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the fourth set and the momentum stuck the rest of the way. Townsend had a kill and a block to get the Mustangs within 14-11, but the visitors scored seven straight to push the lead to nine and eventually won by 12. \nAnother slow start in the final set doomed PCM. Roland-Story once again led 3-0 and then went up 7-1. Senior Karina VanDyke had consecutive kills during a 4-0 PCM run that got its deficit to 7-5, but the Norse recovered to score the set’s final five points for the win. \n“They still don’t completely believe that they can do it,” Ehn said. “That’s been the biggest hurdle for our team this season. They don’t believe in themselves. They just have to know that they can do this. They can’t move past their mistakes.” \nThe eight seniors honored and recognized before the match included Van Gorp, VanDyke, Kendal Earley, Payton Pool, Whitnee Gallaher, Brianna Killins, Abagail VanHaaften and Jami Smith. \n“It’s a good group of girls. I am going to miss them,” Ehn said. “They are all hard workers. They were very open and respectful of a new coach. You never know what will happen with seniors when you come in as a new coach, but I couldn’t have asked for a better group of seniors in my first year.” \nThe Mustangs finish the regular season at 9 a.m. Saturday in the Fairfield Tournament. They begin Class 3A postseason play at 7 p.m. on Sept. 26 at HOIC rival Saydel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:26:33.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
