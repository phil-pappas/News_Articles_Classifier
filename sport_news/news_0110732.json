(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) prev next comments Tweet SINGAPORE â€” Garbine Muguruza won her first match at the WTA Finals, and Angelique Kerber won her second.\nMuguruza, the second-seeded Spaniard who was making her debut at the season-ending tournament, beat Lucie Safarova 6-3, 7-6 (4) Monday. Kerber, seeded sixth, defeated Petra Kvitova 6-2, 7-6 (3).\nThe 22-year-old Muguruza is the first Spaniard to play in the WTA Finals since Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in 2001.\n\"To go here, and play and win for the first time, it's great,\" Muguruza said. \"So I feel now more calm, more in the tournament.\"\nMuguruza reached her first Grand Slam final this year at Wimbledon, losing to Serena Williams in straight sets. She was the first Spanish woman to reach a Grand Slam final since Conchita Martinez lost the French Open final in 2000, and the first to do so at Wimbledon since Sanchez-Vicario in 1995 and 1996.\nKerber is playing at the WTA Finals for the third time, and her victory over the fourth-seeded Kvitova was her seventh match at the tournament. She has never advanced from the round-robin stage of the competition.\n\"I'm here to go out and play every single match I can play and give my best,\" Kerber said. \"I'm starting good right now, but I still have some matches to go.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Garbine+Muguruza%2C+Angelique+Kerber+win+at+WTA+Finals", "http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url="], "published": "2015-10-26T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:24:33.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
