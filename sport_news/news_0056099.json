(WVEC) -- Two Old Dominion University students were hurt in a shooting that took place at an off-campus party early Sunday morning. It was the second shooting that injured ODU students during homecoming weekend. \nNorfolk police said the shooting Sunday happened just after 1:00 a.m. in the 1200 block of West 40th Street. \nWhen officers got there they found two men who had non-life threatening gunshot wounds. Medics took the 19-year-old and 22-year-old ODU students to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. \nWitnesses told police there was a fight involving several people at a party, and that at some point during the argument a man began shooting. \nODU sent an alert to the campus community around 4:20 a.m. It described the man as \"a black male with shoulder length dreadlocks, 18-25 years of age, 5'-10\" to 6'-1\" wearing a red or red and black hooded sweat shirt.\" \nThe alert also said he ran west on 40th Street after the shooting. \n\"One of my friends came out to help his brother,\" said Juan Arango, who lives in the house where the party took place. \"That's when the shots got fired, and then they took off running down 40th, and then the next thing I know we have two friends that got shot. My first friend -- when he got shot -- he went down immediately, and he was in pain. He said his leg was burning. My other friend who got shot, he didn't know he got shot until I told him. I was like, 'Dude, you're bleeding. You need to sit down,'\" Arango told 13News Now. \nThe shooting was the second to take place near campus this weekend and to involve Old Dominion students. \nAround 11:45 p.m. Friday, three people were shot outside another party which took place in a home near 37th Street and Killam Avenue. \nA 19-year-old student and a 20-year-old student were hurt. Police expected both women to recover. The third person who was hit was 26-year-old Keith Lendore of Hampton who was not an ODU student. Lendore died on the scene. Man killed, two female students wounded in shooting near ODU \nOfficers said that both the Norfolk and ODU Police Departments increased patrols in and around the campus over the weekend. \nA Norfolk patrol officer said, \"We want students to enjoy their homecoming weekend without fear of being hurt. If anyone sees something that does not feel right, trust that instinct, leave the area, and give police a call right away.\" \nUniversity spokeswoman Giovanna Genard provided this statement Sunday: \nThe Old Dominion Police Department (ODUPD) doubled patrol staffing in anticipation of large crowds, on- and off-campus, during the evening and early morning hours of Homecoming weekend. \nODUPD will continue patrolling these areas proactively in support of the off-campus community and the Norfolk Police Department, whose agency has primary or full police jurisdiction of Norfolk neighborhoods surrounding campus. \nThe proactive safety enhancements and educational programs ODUPD implemented recently have resulted in a drop in crime incidents on campus, falling below the national average for large universities. But crime in Norfolk continues to be a challenge. We are committed to supporting Norfolk Police's efforts in surrounding neighborhoods and encourage the community to report any suspicious activity to police. The safety of our students is a top priority, and by working together, we can help prevent further violence. \nPolice said the two shootings don't appear to be related. \nIn each case, there was a large number of people present, and detectives stressed they need people to provide them with information so they can catch the people responsible for the shootings. \nAnyone with information is encourage to contact the Norfolk Crime Line through any of several methods: \nCALL: 1-888-LOCK-U-UP (1-888-562-5887) TEXT: Text \"NORFOLK\" and your tip information to 274637 (CRIMES) WEB: Submit a web-tip at: www.norfolkcrimeline.com 1 CONNECT TWEET    //on.wvec.com/1LEEGss TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:51:00.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
