On a backyard rink next to the red barn of DePiero's Farm in Montvale, a young Kyle Palmieri practiced and prepared for his future career. \n\"His rink was right behind my bedroom,\" said Elaine DePiero, Kyle's grandmother and owner of the North Jersey farm. \"We could hear him shooting the puck. His mom would say, 'Not after 11, Grandma's sleeping.' \n\"He'd be out there every night that he could all through the winter.\" \nThose nights gave way to college hockey, a spot on the junior national team and becoming a first-round NHL draft pick, with a career that produced 43 goals and 46 assists in 198 games over five seasons with the Anaheim Ducks. A trade in June brought the right wing back home to New Jersey to play for the Devils. \nIt's not his first time in a Devils uniform. Growing up, he actually played in the NJ Devils youth program. \nOne day earlier this month, Kyle could be found amid the pumpkins and hay bales of his grandparents' farm with various relatives saying hello in passing or teasing him during a photo shoot. The new Devil has \"a ton of cousins,\" and \"if you were looking for one of them, this would be the place,\" he said. \nFor Kyle, growing up with grandparents who owned and operated a 28-acre farm was \"awesome.\" \n\"It gave us the space and freedom to do whatever we wanted,\" said the 24-year-old, who now lives in Hoboken. \"I was lucky enough for my dad to build me my rink on it.\" \nKyle's dad, Bruce Palmieri, put up the rink for nearly two decades — with siblings and friends continuing to use it for years after Kyle left. Last year was the first time the family didn't have it since that inaugural year. The idea for the rink came after the family visited a friend when Kyle was 5 or 6 years old. \n\"We were visiting and his son, who was two years older than Kyle, was out on this tiny rink playing with his buddies,\" Bruce said. \"And, of course, Kyle got brutalized, because he was two years younger. He came off that ice, after getting knocked [down] 20 times, and said, 'Dad I want to play hockey.' \n\"I wasn't a hockey guy, so we kind of learned together,\" Bruce said. \nSkating in family's blood \nBruce Palmieri might not have been a hockey guy, but his mother-in-law already knew the game. Coming from a skating family — her father still hit the ice at 84 — she would go to the River Vale Ice Arena as a young child and watch the New Jersey Skeeters, a semi-pro team that played in the Eastern Hockey League from 1939 to 1942. \n\"After their games, we used to skate on the rink,\" said DePiero, who has skated with Kyle on the family rink \"once in a while.\" \n\"At Christmas or something, when he was home,\" she said. \nArguably his biggest fan, DePiero says she has never missed a televised game he played in. That wasn't easy the last few seasons, as he played his home games in the Pacific time zone. Earlier games are one of the many reasons she is happy to have him home. \n\"I don't have to stay up until 2 a.m.,\" she said. \"My husband falls asleep sometimes watching, but not me.\" \nDePiero would text Kyle before every game to wish him luck. It's a relationship that has always had to overcome a little distance, even when Kyle was living home. Every free moment he had since he was very young was spent on the ice somewhere, his grandmother said. While he has great memories of life on the farm, Kyle admits, \"I might be the only person from our family who's never exactly clocked an hour here,\" he said. \nNow, the nearly century-old farm and store is going through the process of closing in November — having been bought for redevelopment into The Shoppes at DePiero's strip mall. \n\"It's tough,\" Kyle said of the end of the family farm. \"This was like a second home to me when I was young. I had friends that all had summer jobs here. It was a place that hired pretty much all local kids and supported our community like that. I know people from around the state that knew of DePiero's. It's something that everyone kind of remembers from their childhood, whether the pumpkin patch, haunted house or hayrides. … It was a special place, and obviously it'll be pretty sad to see it close its doors for good.\" \nAs his family goes through this huge transition, he is handling one of his own. The trade from the Ducks to the Devils brings Kyle home, but also takes him from a Stanley Cup contender to a team that's rebuilding, and the weather of Southern California for North Jersey winters. While his dad didn't exactly celebrate the deal, worrying instead how Kyle might react to feeling no longer wanted by the organization that made him a first-round draft pick in 2009, DePiero can't contain her smile when asked about New Jersey once again being home base for her grandson.
