Photo by Peter McIntosh. Swimming has been a big part of Daphne Loader's life, and now the mother of double Olympic gold medallist Danyon Loader has been recognised for her service to the sport. \nThe 68-year-old was one of two to receive an honours award for outstanding service to swimming, an award that requires at least 22 years of service, at Swimming New Zealand's annual meeting this week. \nLoader easily qualifies for the award. She got into swimming in 1985, when Danyon started swimming for Dunedin club Zenith. \nShe has held every position at the club, was Swim Otago's president in the 1990s and is a life member of Swim Otago and Zenith. \nLoader attended national meets as either a team manager or time-keeper, and was most recently on the blazer committee, which decided who won awards. \nHer involvement with the sport all but ended last year, but she is helping organise Zenith's 50th jubilee, which will be held next September. \nLoader did not know she had been awarded the service honour when the Otago Daily Times contacted her yesterday, and was ''stunned'' by the latest accolade. \n''Swimming took me to a lot of places,'' she said. \n''It's been a good life. An interesting life with a lot of travel. I was at the 1994 Victoria Commonwealth Games, the 1996 Olympics, the 1990 Commonwealth Games, when [Danyon] started.'' \nDanyon only ever swam for Zenith, and when he retired in 2000, the double Olympic and Commonwealth Games gold medallist finished with 58 national swimming records. \nHe was twice named New Zealand sportsman of the year (1992 and 1997), and in 2000 was named New Zealand sportsperson of the decade for the 1990s. \nHe was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2003, and the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame the following year. \nLoader and her husband Peter still live in South Dunedin, but do not hear from Danyon much. \nHe has just arrived back in Auckland after a six-month holiday in Scotland. \n''He was coaching in Auckland before he went to Scotland. It will take him a while to get adjusted and send me an email to tell me what he is doing,'' she said. \n''What exactly his latest job is, I actually don't have a clue. I hear from him, like most boys, not very often.'' \nCanterbury administrator and official Lesley Huckins was named Swimming New Zealand's new president at the meeting. \nShe takes over from John Mace, who has completed his maximum three years in the role.
