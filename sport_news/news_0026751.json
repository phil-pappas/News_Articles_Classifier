Kent-Meridian is up next in an SPSL 4A South league game, which means no messing around. Kickoff is Friday at French Field at 7 p.m. \n“K-M is always one of the toughest games we have every year,” said linebacker Joshua Tingstad. “They have a lot of really good athletes over there.” \nMost Read Stories Seattle Seahawks release WR B.J.

Receiver Emmanuel Daigbe and running back Malik Woolery are two the Conquerors will have to contain. Each average about 100 yards per game. \n“(Emmanuel) can scale up and get the ball wherever he is, so it’s going to be a challenge for us,” said Tingstad. \nThe Royals (3-3, 2-1) have losses to Battle Ground and Beamer, and last week dropped a close game to Tahoma. Kentwood smashed Tahoma, 55-30, two weeks ago. But the Conquerors say they’re expecting a tough, physical game against K-M because that’s the way it is every year. \n“It’s nothing we haven’t seen before, because Tahoma and Federal Way were pretty physical,” said defensive lineman Paul Finau, “but we have to do a better job of containing the outside and finishing plays if we want to win.” \nOn offense, Kentwood has been on a roll behind quarterback Ben Woods and running backs Williams and Chavez Kalua-Fuiamaono. And the Conquerors have kept defenses on their toes with a lot of movement before plays. \n“It took a little bit to get used to under (new coach) Michael Bush, but it’s paying off,” said Woods. “The defense has to make a lot more calls and you can see how confusing it is for them to not be able to pick up on what we’re doing. \n“We don’t really have many tendencies.” \nSolange Reyner: 206-464-2176 or sreyner@seattletimes.com .
