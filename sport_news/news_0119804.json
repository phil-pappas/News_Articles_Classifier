Bob Anderson came from far behind to edge Hohn for the season championship. Todd Hohn, who flies about 150,000 miles globally each year for business, traveled 26 hours — including layovers — from India to wrap up his racing season at the track. His plane touched down in Chicago just a few hours before the first round of competition Saturday. “With all of the travel I do for work and being out of the country, the stars have aligned for me to make all the point races at Byron this season,” said the 47-year-old Woodstock racer. Hohn was first in the Super Pro no-box standings with a nine-point lead over Anderson entering the weekend. Anderson, 51, of Freeport overcame the deficit by finishing second in the no-box race Saturday and reaching the third round Sunday. He also was the overall Super Pro champ (94 points), topping box winner Ryan McCann of Madison, Wisconsin (91). Hohn (89) was second in no-box and third overall. It was Anderson's sixth Super Pro crown at Byron. He has eight track championship in his career that began in 1988. \"I feel really fortunate to get this one,\" he said. \"After I won in 2010, I thought that would be the last one because the competition is getting tougher and tougher and I'm getting older. So this is probably my most special season.\" What made it even more special was Anderson also won Byron's Pro division crown this year, capturing the title by a single point with a victory in the season's final race Sunday. It was the first time he competed for points in both divisions in the same year. Hohn has earned two season championships in his 32-year racing career — Pro class at Byron and Super Pro at Cordova Dragway Park. He also finished second in the no-box class at the 2009 IHRA Summit Super Series Nationals in Rockingham, North Carolina. Hohn is the global director of Workplace Health and Safety for Underwriters Laboratories, based in Northbrook. His work takes him to Asia, Europe and South Africa, where he promotes safe living and working environments. For three seasons while living in Nashville, Tennessee, Hohn would fly into Chicago on race weekends and drive up Byron. He would leave his 1968 Pontiac Firebird race car with his father, Terry, who lives in Rock Falls. “I’ve been fortunate that my father and I have done this for 32 years. And my success is due to my family — my dad, my mom (Marilyn), my girlfriend (Monique), and two daughters (Taylor and Sydney) and rest of my extended family.” In other action Sunday at Byron, the Rev. Randy Heinzeroth of Roscoe won the Street season champ, while Chris Folk of Poplar Grove took the Sportsman crown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:17:50.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
