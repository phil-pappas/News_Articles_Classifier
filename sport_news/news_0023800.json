It was the opener at Iowa.\n\"The Spartans won by the way, 21-7,\" Blaha said recently at a fund-raiser in Brighton for the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, a group that raises money for multiple charities.\n\"I wasn't happy about it that day,\" Blaha said. \"It was a colossal coaching matchup between Biggie Munn and Forest Evashevski (a Detroit native). The Spartans went on to win the Rose Bowl (28-20 over UCLA), and Iowa went on to finish in the top 10. It was a heck of a game.\"\nDue to the nostalgia of his childhood upbringing, Blaha said his favorite Big Ten road game is when MSU travels to Iowa and Kinnick Stadium.\nBlaha is a Notre Dame graduate who also earned an MBA from Michigan. In 2002, he was named an honorary alumnus of MSU.\n\"I've been doing the games so long I feel like I am (an MSU grad),\" he said.\n\"I feel I became a Spartan when the coaches became my friends, which wasn't too long after I started broadcasting the games. It started with George Perles, and every coach has been very accepting. And the assistant coaches there have been spectacular. And you're never going to cheer against your friends, that's the bottom line.\"\nWhen it comes to other favorites, Blaha said it was easy to pick his favorite MSU play of all time â€” so far, anyway.\n\"There are a lot of great plays that are tied for second,\" Blaha said. \"When you win a Rose Bowl and you come roaring back to beat Baylor in the Cotton Bowl, when you beat Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game, those things are so significant. And so many Coach Perles wins and Coach (Nick) Saban wins, but this is a Bobby Williams win.\n\"In the last second against the University of Michigan (in 2001), when you beat your biggest rival with a touchdown with 1 second to go, it doesn't get any better than that. It was T.J. Duckett, and I'm up in the booth thinking to myself, 'Oh, my God, he's wide open.' How would you like to be the guy who's wide open and here comes the ball? You catch it, you've made history. If you don't catch it, you've made history. T.J. to his credit, got it done.\"\nBlaha, 70, may or may not have the final say of when he will retire, but he's not planning it anytime soon.\n\"As long as I am still able to do what I do, I would hate to kick back and not enjoy the moment of being involved in the game,\" said Blaha, longtime voice of the Pistons. \"And there's no better way to be involved in the game than to broadcast it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:21:22.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
