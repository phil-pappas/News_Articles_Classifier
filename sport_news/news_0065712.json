Both were injured against Texas A&M on Oct. 3. \n\"They're close,\" MSU coach Dan Mullen said. \"We'll find out. They'll be judgment calls this week depending on how they progress.\" \nFred Ross returned to his record-setting pace against Louisiana Tech. He caught three of Dak Prescott's first four passes after only two receptions last week. He then went to the locker room midway through the first quarter with an undisclosed injury. \nHe returned to the field in the second quarter, but didn't play in the second half. \n\"Fred Ross, they cleared him to go back into the game (Saturday),\" Mullen said. \"I'm hoping that means he'd ready to play this week.\" \nPrescott lost Gus Walley, his third-leading receiver, early in the second. The tight end returned to action this week after missing the last two games with a wrist injury. \nWalley left the game twice against Louisiana Tech. He needed assistance off the field after Xavier Woods collided into the tight end's chest. He returned later in the drive but suffered another vicious collision in the end zone. The training staff took him immediately to the locker room when Walley got to his feet. \nMullen didn't have an update on Walley's status. \nRunning back Ashton Shumpert and defensive back Jamal Peters didn't play at all Saturday. A back injury held Shumpert out of the game, but Mullen said he expected to play against Kentucky. \nPeters missed the game with a concussion, sources told The Clarion-Ledger \n\"Jamal Peters, we hope to have him back next week,\" Mullen said. \"We thought he'd be able to play today. They didn't make the call. Especially as a freshman, not practicing all week, we held him out.\" \nMalik Dear also missed some time during the game, but returned and made six catches for 70 yards. Offensive tackle Rufus Warren played after missing last week's game with an ankle injury that he suffered at Texas A&M. The Bulldogs were without Kendrick Market for the second straight week. The senior safety had surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament last week. \n\"That's one of the reasons I love to rotate guys,\" Mullen said. \"I love to rotate players so that guys are ready for those situations when their numbers are called.\" \nHaughton reunion \nAmidst the postgame handshaking and celebrating, three football players and a man wearing a gray T-shirt that read \"Haughton Football\" met at midfield. \nMississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott embraced Louisiana Tech running back Marlon Seets. The duo formed the backfield at Haughton High six years ago. Rodney Guin, their former Haughton coach, joined the trio with a handshake and a hug. \n\"That was fun,\" Prescott said. \"I was excited.\" Competitors on the field. Best friends off it.

Craft graduated from Haughton as well. His older brother, Jordan, is one of Prescott's best friends. \nThe former Haughton standouts combined for 488 yards and four touchdowns in the game on Saturday. Prescott accounted for 381 yards and all four scores. \n\"I told them, they thought they had it for a second,\" Prescott said. \"They just laughed. They didn't have much to say after that.\" A Haughton High School reunion at midfield. pic.twitter.com/ag5h31CeBA — Michael Bonner (@MikeBBonner) October 17, 2015 \nContact Michael Bonner at mbonner@jackson.gannett.com.
