And super-congratulations if you don’t know what I’m talking about. \nYou are one of the few remaining earthlings who hasn’t been swept up in the fantasy tidal wave. \nMillions are playing. Billions have gotten sick of the commercials. Sports leagues and media conglomerates are jumping into bed with daily fantasy sites. \nUnless you have Colin Kaepernick as your quarterback, everybody is having a grand old time. \nNobody wants to talk about the looming downside. \n“There’s always a cost,” Kevin Whyte said. “But right now there’s an absence of recognizing there are any problems.” \nWhyte is executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling. Wait, did somebody say g-g-gambling? \nNot the NFL or NBA or Major League Baseball. And certainly not the fantasy industry. \nAll claim that picking a virtual team and wagering money on its performance is different than picking a real team and wagering money on its performance. \nThe first is legal because it’s based on skill. The second isn’t because it’s based on chance. \nFeel free to laugh at the distinction. \nOf course fantasy sports is gambling. And you know what? That’s all right. \nI’m not pro-gambling, but pragmatism says banning it would go about as well as Prohibition. Humans have vices, and if adults want to risk their paychecks on whether the Bucs will lose by fewer than 9.5 points, have at it. \nMost can gamble, get their kicks and walk away. The problem is about 5 percent of gamblers are prone to addiction and the financial and emotional ruin that it brings. \nCongress outlawed online gambling in 2006. Fantasy sports were exempted, largely because they were seen as season-long hobbies based on camaraderie as much as cash. \nTechnology quickly evolved, and now anyone with a smart phone can pick a team in hopes of a huge daily payoff. \nAnd this isn’t greyhound racing or Texas Hold’em. It’s the NFL, America’s pastime. \nTake that lure, throw in unprecedented access, and daily fantasy is arguably the biggest gateway drug to gambling addiction in history. \nCongress wants to review the 2006 law and potentially include fantasy sports. We need to at least tap the brakes and try to envision where the runaway freight train might be leading. \nThere aren’t any comprehensive studies on its effect, but 56 million people will play this year. \nThat’s a lot of potential fantasy crack addicts, and the biggest pushers are supposedly responsible companies like the Disney, the NBA, Fox, MLB, Comcast and Yahoo! \nAll have invested in daily fantasy sites. The NFL hasn’t as a league, but 28 teams have deals with DraftKings or FanDuel. \nThey justify it by promoting the fiction that it’s not about winning money. It’s about a bunch of pals having a big time pretending to general managers. \nThey’ve somehow missed the 2.3 billion DraftKings and FanDuel commercials aired in the past month, all of which touted how much money you could win playing against thousands of online strangers. \n“It’s all about the win,” Whyte said. \nCompanies also justify it by thinking how much money they’ll make if fantasy sports continues to explode. If that leads to a quantum leap in addiction, maybe the NFL will provide free Uber rides to the nearest Gamblers Anonymous meeting. \nBy the way, that group is expected to soon adopt a new warning in its literature: If you want to recover from a gambling addiction, stay away from fantasy sports. \nWebsites, the leagues and ESPN should at least slap on a Surgeon General’s-type warning telling players of fantasy’s addictive dangers. Of course, that would admit there are dangers, and they can’t have that. \nIt’s easier to pretend it’s nothing but good cheap fun and nobody gets harmed. \nIf you believe that, I have a 49ers quarterback I’d like to trade you.
