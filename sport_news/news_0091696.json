Also, jugging takes up a lot of space and can be difficult to do by one person. \"In order to make such fishing easier and more effective, I designed an alternative,\" said an inventor from Statesville, N.C. He then created a prototype of his idea.\nThe CATCH A LOT facilitates the \"jugging\" method of fishing, which allows for more successful catches. It doesnâ€™t take up a lot of boat space, and it enables a user to perform the task without assistance. Compact and easy to use, it's safe for the environment and can be used in all kinds of waters.\nThe original design was submitted to the Fort Mill office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
