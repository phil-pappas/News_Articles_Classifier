Here is his account:\nNUEVO VALLARTA, Mexico - Our first inkling that something was up was Thursday afternoon on our way to the beach and we saw the staff filling sandbags. We got settled under a tiki hut and soon our waiter, Pedro, came over for our cerveza order. We asked what's up with the sandbags, and he replied: \"A hurricane is coming!\"\nWhat a way to end a vacation!\nAfter we were kicked off the beach at 3 p.m., we went back to our room at the Grand Mayan Resort in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, and turned on CNN. Not only was Hurricane Patricia bearing down on the west coast of Mexico but it quickly turned into a category 5. Oh boy!\nWe read as much as we could on the Internet and learned that landfall wouldn't be until four hours after our plane was scheduled to take off the next day. Great. We might have a chance of heading home before all hell breaks loose.\nSleeping Thursday night was pointless, a combination of the rich dinner we ate in Puerto Vallarta and nervousness over the approaching storm. We got out of bed at 6 a.m. and checked our email. Sure enough, our flight back to Philadelphia was canceled. A quick conference about our next plan ensued.\nRenting a car and trying to outrun the historic storm didn't seem like a good idea since my Spanish is of the basic high school variety. Besides we don't know the area at all, nor the conditions of the roads - we didn't travel on any interstate highways during our week stay. And all the locals would be trying to evacuate as well.\nNo, we decided to stay put at the resort. We're on the sixth floor, but facing the ocean. Not good but at least we'll be above the storm surge. We decided to make a quick trip to the little food market on the premises, and unlike going to Wawa before a snowstorm, there was actually lots of food and water on the shelves!\nMidmorning we were alerted that the Grand Mayan building was going to be evacuated at 2 p.m. so start packing your bags - and put them in the bathtub for safekeeping. Just bring valuables with us.\nLooking out the window of our room at 1:30 p.m. the waters of Banderis Bay in front of our resort are the calmest it's been all week. The proverbial \"calm before the storm.\" My companion, Sue Sampson, and I went out so I could take photos around the complex and found three people from Delaware County walking the beach. Small world. The hotel lobby was getting full when we returned. People didn't seem too anxious. Everyone was wondering how safe the building we were being evacuated to could be since it was only 100 meters inland from the resort. Someone said it was a four-story, concrete parking garage and the guests will be on the third and fourth floors. Now that sounds like fun!\nLast-minute emails and phone calls to family before we shut down. Likely won't have electricity for several days. Hoping we can find out when the airport reopens somehow.\nHasta luego, mis amigos!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:12:28.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
