(AP) - Republican lawmakers are proposing to spend $2.5 million in state money to create more drug courts as New Hampshire battles an ongoing opioid abuse crisis.\nState Sens. Jeb Bradley of Wolfeboro and David Boutin of Hooksett will announce the plan Tuesday in front of City Hall in Manchester, alongside Mayor Ted Gatsas and other public officials.\nFive of the state's 10 counties currently have drug courts. Under the legislation, the state would provide 50 percent of the money to open drug courts, with counties kicking in the rest. The bill would also establish an office focused on drug courts within the state's judicial branch.\nTo receive the grant, counties would need to have an organized arrangement with a treatment center to ensure the courts have somewhere to send people.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
