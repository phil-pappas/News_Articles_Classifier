Let us ask the animal kingdom. (Published Friday, Oct. 9, 2015) We love animals and sports here at NBC 7 SportsWrap so we decided to steal an idea that is in no way new, but always fun and combine the two. I put the two tortoises I’m watching to work and Derek Togerson put his cat and dog on the case and had them predict who was going to win, the Chargers or the Steelers Monday night? If you want to get your pets involved it doesn’t take a fancy camera; I used my iPhone to film the tortoises. Just tape your pets predicting next Sunday’s game between the Chargers and the Green Bay Packers. Keep it short so you can send it without a problem and we can feature as many videos as possible. Email them to me at Becki.Schildhouse@nbcuni.com by the Friday before the game. Include your name, pets name and where you’re from. *NBC 7 will not use any videos where the animals appear to be forced to do something they don’t want to do.
