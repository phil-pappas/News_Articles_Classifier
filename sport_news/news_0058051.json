He notably had contentious encounters with Kobe Bryant, Serge Ibaka, Kevin Love, Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver and James Harden's mother in NBA arenas. He also did plenty to disturb the Grizzlies during playoff battles while playing for the Los Angeles Clippers.\nBarnes is the guy you hate if he's on the other team and love when he's on your side. He's a relentless, physical defensive player who also acts as the team's enforcer because Barnes can be counted on to insert himself in the middle of a conflict involving a teammate.\nBarnes is a bad dude on the court, and proud of the perception although he often receives technical fouls and quick ejections from referees.\n\"I'm the NBA bad guy and it's gotten me this far so I have to continue to be that person on the court,\" Barnes said. \"But off the court, it's not who I am. It's probably the furthest thing from what I am.\"\nNews last week that Barnes had a physical altercation with former teammate and New York Knicks coach Derek Fisher at the Los Angeles-area home of his estranged wife, Gloria Govan, chipped away at his off-court persona.\nThe Grizzlies, however, are hardly uneasy about Barnes living in the Grindhouse. He's a welcome addition who is widely getting the benefit of the doubt.\n\"I like his swag. I don't get into that other stuff. I just know he wants to win,\" Griz swingman Tony Allen said. \"When I'm around Matt, I have my own perception of him and that's what I live with. He's cool to me. I know what comes with that. He's a tough guy.\"\nThe Griz acquired Barnes from the Charlotte Hornets for Luke Ridnour in late June. The Clippers had traded Barnes, with Spencer Hawes, to the Hornets for Lance Stephenson earlier in June.\nGriz brass decided to double down on grit-and-grind by pairing Barnes with Allen, the franchise's dean of defense. The already edgy Griz got edgier by design because Barnes and Allen are almost twins.\nBoth players are no-nonsense and rugged on the court. They are often gentle and generous yet misunderstood outside the bright lights. FedExForum is not only a place where perceived misfits have gelled, it's a station where second chances are granted and often taken advantage of.\nZach Randolph knows the feeling.\nHe was vilified by a segment of local media and fans, who automatically expected Randolph to be a troublemaker in the locker room and someone whose actions off the court would depress the community.\nAffectionately known as Z-Bo, the veteran 6-9 forward spent the past several years showing his wares as a strong father, performing as the greatest Grizzly on the floor and easily the most philanthropic off it.\n\"It's just about people getting to know you,\" Randolph said. \"In this league, people believe what they read, but they really don't know you. We're under a microscope, but how much do you really know the person? Matt's a good dude. He's loyal and he works hard.\"\nTo know Barnes is to realize his humility. He uses Twitter regularly to promote fatherhood and authenticity in every aspect of his life. Barnes' twin sons visited him at Griz training camp on the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara before the Fisher incident.\nGovan doesn't publicly speak ill of Barnes. Even after Barnes stirred celebrity gossip with his claims of dating pop singer Rihanna in July, Govan told TMZ that she and Barnes always discuss introducing new relationships to their children.\n\"I always tell Matt that if you're ready for someone to meet our kids, then I want to meet them, I want to talk to them,\" Govan said. \"I want to feel them out so I know who is around our kids.\"\nAs it turns out, Barnes drove his children from Santa Barbara to their Los Angeles home once training camp concluded because the Griz had the next day off.\n\"My kids are the most important people in the world to me,\" Barnes said. \"Any time we get a chance to hang out, wrestle, play basketball, play video games or whatever, that's what I live for. I love being a father.\"\nBarnes' sense of family and protectiveness came from his parents and growing as the child of an interracial marriage.\nBarnes' father, Henry, is black. His mother, Ann, is white and died of cancer in 2007. Barnes runs a charitable foundation, Athletes vs. Cancer, that he founded in memory of his mother. The tattoo across his abdomen is of his mother — with angel wings.\nAthletes vs. Cancer provides financial assistance to families with the costs of medical bills, treatments and medication.\n\"With UCLA, we're now providing scholarships for kids who beat cancer and want to go to college,\" Barnes said. \"I think I'm judged a lot of times by my tattoos and my physical play on the court. But off the court I am chill and down to earth.\"\nOn the court, the Griz are hoping Barnes can at least come close to producing like he did last season in a Clippers uniform. He averaged 10.1 points on 44-percent shooting, four rebounds and 1.5 assists. Barnes also shot 36 percent from beyond the 3-point arc.\nAll-Star point guard Chris Paul said the Clippers will undoubtedly feel Barnes' absence.\n\"There's no question we're going to miss Matt,\" Paul told the Los Angeles Times. \"Matt brought a lot to our team — leadership, toughness. Matt was just one of a kind.\"\nDespite Barnes missing all of his eight 3-point shots during the preseason, Griz coach Dave Joerger lauds what Barnes brings beyond numbers.\n\"We're still getting to know each other, but I really like him,\" Joerger said. \"He's a stand-up guy. He says what's on his mind. He's upfront. You can't do that if you don't bring it to work every day. And he has brought it every day. I look at the last two (preseason) games and he hasn't made a shot. Yet I love everything he's done. His teammates love playing with him.\"\nJoerger embraces Barnes just as Clippers coach Doc Rivers once did.\n\"I think half of that is earned, and half of it is misunderstood,\" Rivers told the L.A. Times about Barnes' reputation. \"You know, I don't think you are given a reputation — I think you earn one, for the most part. I like what Matt brings and I like his reputation. He's on the edge, and that's good.\"\nThe acceptance of a supporting role is what has made Barnes' career. Now, Barnes is in another place where he's accepted and supported.\n\"This is going to be a place where he can find a home,\" Joerger said. \"We love having him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:27:36.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
