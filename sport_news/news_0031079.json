Hannah Gaylord, 20:11 Related Media DELTA — This is why Battle Mountain cross-country runs in all those Front Range meets. After the Liberty Bell and others with tough courses and stiff competition, the Huskies showed up at the Western Slope meet in Delta and dominated on Friday. The ladies put their varsity seven into the top 10. The gents’ scorers went 1-2-5-6-7. (No Durango at this meet, but that’s still quite the show.) And, yes, Battle Mountain swept to victory on Friday. ‘HARD WORK PAYS OFF’ And, just as a reminder, this is the regional course in two weeks. “Both teams have embraced the Front Range, competing against the best in the state,” Huskies coach Rob Parish said. “It’s also fun to race against Western Slope schools. After racing tough courses, it’s also fun to run a fast course and see how the hard work pays off.” This wasn’t a pure speed race because Parish had his runners pack-run for the first 2 miles before putting on the jets. Nonetheless, the stats bear out the speed. Alexis Aguirre nipped Ethan Pence for the individual win. Alex Raichart brought home the gold for the ladies. Next up is Rifle on Thursday for the Huskies.
