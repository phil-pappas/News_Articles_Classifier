County were aggrieved as there appeared to be a foul by Joel Grant in the build-up, but referee Graham Salisbury waved play on.That allowed Grant to run forward and feed Tom Nichols, who cut onto his right foot and curled a delightful shot into the bottom corner from 20 yards.Both teams were playing some excellent football, but after Izale McLeod had nodded against a post, County deservedly equalised on 31 minutes when a long ball forward was nodded down by Jon Stead and Liam Noble was able to knock the ball past Exeter goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik.The second half was far more attritional with very few chances for either side. Exeter's Jordan Tillson almost put through his own goal, while Arron Davies screwed Exeter's best chance wide as neither team were able to find a winning goal.
