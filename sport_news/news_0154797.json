Jupiter drops to 0-5 on the season.\nPalm Beach Gardens pounded Jupiter's defense for 210 yards rushing. Senior Donnell Perry was the workhorse in the backfield for the Gators, tallying 110 yards on 23 carries. His 4-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter accounted for the final score.\nSenior quarterback Hunter Aranda notched Gardens' other two touchdowns, both on 1-yard sneaks.\n\"It probably wasn't pretty. We decided we were going to run the ball from the get-go,\" Gardens coach Rob Freeman said.\nPalm Beach Gardens marched 94 yards on its second possession and grabbed a 7-0 lead with Aranda's first sneak. The quarterback also scored on a short sneak early in the third quarter after Gardens blocked a Jupiter punt that gave the Gators possession at the Warriors' 14.\nComplete coverage package: Palm Beach high school football, week 6 Read more stories Jupiter's only score came on a 24-yard field goal by Edwin Noyes midway through the second quarter.\nPalm Beach Gardens had a chance to extend its lead just before halftime but the drive stalled at the 6 when time expired, and the Gators went to the locker room clinging to a 7-3 lead.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f37e7/turbine/sfl-complete-coverage-package-palm-beach-high-school-football-week-6-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f4d2e/turbine/fl-pbgardens-jupiter-recap-1003-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-03T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:42:04.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
