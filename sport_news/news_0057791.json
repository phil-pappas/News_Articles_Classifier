Team coach Maxwell Konadu and his team are expected to leave Obuasi for Accra this coming weekend for their trip to Abidjan. \nJoel Fameyeh who is the only lower division player in Maxwell Konadu’s team says everything is going well as they prepare for the return leg. \n“It wasn’t all easy but we have been training for six weeks now. So we are getting to know each other a little bit. Playing with them is gradually becoming a training session, we are not getting scared.” \n“Our coaches also have been giving us tactics to play, everyone has a role to play on the team.” \n“We have much experienced players in the team, we are young and new so the experienced ones are really helping us.” \nFameyeh scored both goals for Ghana in the first leg victory over the Ivorians. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
