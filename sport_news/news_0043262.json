(Photo: Al Goldis, For the Lansing State Journal) Buy Photo \nEAST LANSING - Jasmine Hines has grown accustomed to having to go through every single rep in practice. \nThat wasn't the case Wednesday as the Michigan State women's basketball team opened practice at Breslin Center. \nThe Spartans have depth and health as they begin their quest to bounce back from a 2014-15 season plagued by injuries. \n\"We have a deeper group, a healthy group so that's a positive thing,\" said MSU coach Suzy Merchant, who is in her ninth season leading the Spartans. \"I'm really excited about (getting started). We've got some athletes and it's all about putting them together. It's fun to start practice and start the journey.\" \nThe Spartans, who finished 16-15 last season, have a number of new faces for Merchant to work with that includes freshmen Kalabrya Gondrezick, Octavia Barnes, Nathy Dambo, Hana Vesela and Jenna Allen and sophomore transfer Morgan Green. There's also the return of Akyah Taylor to the program after she spent two years at the University of St. Francis in Fort Wayne, Ind. Taylor ready to finish what she started at MSU \n\"I think it's exciting,\" Merchant said. \"It's nice to see some of those kids that could have helped us so much (last year) obviously on the court with particularly Branndais (Agee) and Jasmine Hines. Those are all-conference players basically and to have them out there really makes a difference. What a crazy deal a year makes.\" \nA year ago injuries to Agee (ACL), Hines (concussion) and others left the Spartans with a limited number of options throughout Big Ten play. MSU played with just seven healthy bodies and had to add volleyball player Kelsey Kuipers to the roster for help. \nThe Spartans hope to avoid those problems this season and get back toward the top of the Big Ten standings. \n\"It's definitely different having a lot of bodies,\" Hines said. \"We've always caught the injury bug every year so fingers crossed we don't catch that again. \n\"We're all very excited to get back on the court because last year obviously we started off really good and then we kind of fought the injury bug. We know we have a lot of potential, a lot of athletes and we're just kind of looking forward to building off that.\" \nContact Brian Calloway at bcalloway@lsj.com.
