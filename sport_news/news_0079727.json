(AP) â€” Christian McCaffrey caught a touchdown pass, ran for another score and gained 300 all-purpose yards in another sterling all-around performance to lead No. 10 Stanford to its sixth straight victory, 31-14 over Washington on Saturday night.\nKevin Hogan threw for 290 yards and two scores for the Cardinal (6-1, 5-0 Pac-12). They have topped 30 points in each game since a season-opening loss to Northwestern thanks to their efficient quarterback and all-purpose star.\nMcCaffrey, who entered the game with an FBS-best 253 all-purpose yards per game, had a 50-yard touchdown catch and 7-yard scoring run in the third quarter. In all, he ran 23 times for 109 yards, caught five passes for a career-high 112 yards and added 79 yards on kick returns in his third 300-yard all-purpose game of the season.\nThe Huskies (3-4, 1-3) were no match for the Cardinal, especially with starting quarterback Jake Browning watching with an injury. Backup K.J. Carta-Samuels completed just 9 of 21 passes for 118 yards as Washington didn't even cross midfield until the third quarter.\nThe one bright spot for the Huskies was freshman running back Myles Gaskin, who ran for 108 yards and a score for his third straight 100-yard game. Gaskin ran five times for 57 yards on the opening drive of the third quarter to cut Stanford's lead to 17-7.\nMcCaffrey took over from there. He sneaked out of the backfield on the next drive and hauled in a deep pass from Hogan before outrunning the defense for the touchdown. He then iced the game with his TD run to cap the next drive, making it 31-7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:34:57.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
