He often strolls home after matches and even wrote a thesis 'Walking - Inventory and evaluation of a sport for all' while obtaining a diploma in sports science \n:: His methods are both innovative and unorthodox - for last year's Champions League tie against Arsenal he held Dortmund's final training session in Regent's Park. \n:: Klopp is a committed Christian and often discusses his faith in public. \n:: He is such a popular figure in Germany he is credited with turning around the fortunes of car manufacturer Opel after becoming an ambassador for the firm, after which sales of its Insignia model were boosted by 35 per cent in 2014. \n:: Klopp's popularity has also spread to the world of music, where eccentric media personality Matze Knop has released two songs in tribute to the coach called 'I Wanna Be Like Jurgen Klopp' and 'Kloppo You Rockstar'. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
