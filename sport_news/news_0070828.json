Pointer: With the weather turning crisp, Wellesley's 'D' should thrive This is a special time of the year for old Pointer indeed. It’s the epitome of football weather at the heart of the gridiron season. Comment By T.D. Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By T.D. Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 9:00 PM By T.D. Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 9:00 PM It’s now time for T.D. Pointer to welcome everyone to the midway. This is a special time of the year for old Pointer indeed. It’s the epitome of football weather at the heart of the gridiron season. Please, Mother Nature, no more Indian Summer. There’s nothing like the crisp, cold weather we’re getting into to get jacked and pumped about schoolboy football. Oh, how sweet it is to hear the pads smack together when the temps drop into the 40s and 30s. Pointer’s bones get rattled just hearing the thuds from the stands. Those vicarious stings turn T.D. into the King of Pain. The trees are ablaze with leaves soon to fall and join the ones already covering the ground. Aren’t those piles of leaves a pure joy to dive into? In Back to the Future moments, T.D. can once again pretend he’s Sam Bam leaping over the Bear’s Bama defense. With October winding down and the annual diversionary trips to the Big E and King Richard’s Faire history, T.D.’s focus shifts to all things football. But Pointer has to admit the jousting tournament at King Richard’s reminds T.D. of old-school tackling drills. Lances shattering on shields with armored knights charging on horses. It could just as easily be the clash of Riddells between fullbacks and linebackers. Oh, how Pointer misses MNF’s Jacked Up! halftime highlights hits and longs for those un-PC days. That’s how much football dominates this prognosticating wizard’s psyche. Even the upcoming festive holidays have gridiron themes for Pointer. Halloween? Oh, Pointer could dress up as a Gridiron Super Hero like Butkus, Hog Hannah, Ronnie Lott, or Rodney Harrison. But no, Pointer wants to honor the coaching geniuses. How about going as half Tuna and half His Hoodieness. Keep it simple. That means baggy shorts, a hooded sweatshirt and a headset. If I can do good impressions of those two personalities, I’ll be scarier than Darth Vader and Michael Myers. “Do your job. OK, fellas?” Thanksgiving? It’s schoolboy football from morning to night, beginning with the mother and senior sons pregame ceremonies to Mike Lynch’s non-stop highlights of the traditional rivalries. What a feast. But that’s getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s get down to the task at hand with the season heading down the stretch, the state playoffs a week away and nothing but bone-rattling chilly game days ahead. Let’s start with the clash of unbeatens Saturday with the Bay State Conference Herget title on the line when Wellesley hosts Milton at Hunnewell Field. Milton is the higher-rated team in most polls. The Wildcats are high-octane on offense and averaging nearly 30 a game. And the Raiders do struggle to score. Page 2 of 2 - But the point differential is about even. And gotta love that Raider D with sturdy players like Chase Connelly and Toby dePeyster up front, hard-hitters like Will Cramer and Sam McGee backing them up, and the ubiquitous Griffin Morgan leading the secondary. They’re allowing just 6 a game. Defense wins championships. Wellesley wins. T.D. guarantees it. In another BSC Herget game Saturday, Natick knocks down Norwood. In an evenly matched Hockomock Davenport matchup, Milford falls just short against Stoughton . In yet another even matchup, this one in the Mayflower Large, Tri-County can’t take down Southeastern . Moving to the CMass slate on Saturday, Burncoat beats Blackstone-Millville, Nipmuc gets by Sutton in a DVC game, and perennial power St. John’s overpowers Marlborough. In a pair of CAL games, league-leading Valley Tech stays on top by romping past rival Bay Path, and Assabet keeps ahead of Worcester Tech. Going back to Friday night, Framingham is no match for Newton North in BSC Carey action. In the Catholic Central Small, Pointer has to take Cathedral over Marian. In a DCL Large matchup of perennially strong programs that are now struggling, Lincoln-Sudbury falls short at Acton-Boxboro . In a battle for second in the DCL Small, Wayland falls short at Bedford . In the Hockomock’s Kelley-Rex, Franklin can’t overtake Attleboro . In the CMass games under the Friday night lights, Mid-Wach B’s Algonquin beats Mid-Wach A’s Wachusett while MWA’s Shepherd Hill routs MWB’s Westborough. North Middlesex is too strong for Hudson in this MWB exclusive. And in the SWCL B, league-leading Uxbridge crushes lowly Millbury. Finally, Pointer looks at five Tri-Valley League games. Mighty Holliston stays unbeaten by thrashing Norton. In the TVL Large, Hopkinton topples Medfield while Westwood overwhelms Medway. In the TVL Small, Ashland uses undefeated homecooking to beat Bellingham. And last, but far from least, is the battle at the top of the Small. Dover-Sherborn has EMass Div. 5’s top TD passer in Eric Levine, but Millis-Hopedale has running back extraordinaire Josh Pierre-Charles. Like the Almighty Tuna once said and Pointer believes is true, “Power wins football games.” Go with Millis-Hopedale . Last week's record: 18-4 T.D. Pointer is a Daily News correspondent . By T.D.
