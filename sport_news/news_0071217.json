It was the last day of the 8th Asian Age Group Championships on Sunday and two Gujarat swimmers—Neil Contractor and Anshul Kothari—did the nation proud by being part of the Indian men's 4x200 freestyle relay team which managed to win a bronze medal.\nJoining Virdhawal Khade and Sajan Prakash in the team, the boys clocked 7:50:74 to take the third position to finish behind podium toppers Thailand and second-placed China.\nWith this, Gujarat swimmers ended with two gold medals (Maana Patel in 50m backstroke and Neil and Anshul in 4x100 freestyle relay earlier) and one bronze in 4x200 freestyle relay on Sunday.\nKamlesh Nanavati, secretary of Swimming Federation of India and coach of Gujarat team, said that he is very happy with the show his wards have put up in Bangkok. \"Maana has given India best time in 50m backstroke. Even in the 100m backstroke event today, she was leading up till 75m mark but unfortunately came fourth. I am also pleased with Neil's show in 100m freestyle event,\" Nanavati said.
