Thailand top the Group F table on seven points after three matches, two ahead of 2007 Asian champions Iraq, who missed a chance to overtake the Thais after they needed a last-gasp penalty to salvage a point in Thursday's 1-1 draw with Vietnam in Hanoi. Having watched Vietnam play group favourites Iraq, the 41-year-old Kiatisak acknowledged his charges would be in for a tough ride at My Dinh Stadium in the Vietnamese capital. \"The Vietnam players are really good and they have improved significantly since losing to us 1-0 in May. With them playing at home this time, it's even more intimidating for us. Their strength lies in defence, while their attack is dangerous, particularly their captain and striker Le Cong Vinh, who was outstanding [against Iraq]. With only the top team automatically through to the final qualifying round, and the best four second-placed sides completing the last-12 lineup, former national striker Kiatisak wants two wins and a draw from the remaining games. \"As for our last three games, in Vietnam on October 13, at home to Taiwan on November 12 and away to Iraq on March 24, we need to claim at least seven points. If we achieve that, we reach the last-12 round. \"The most important thing for us is to stay focused for every second. We can't afford to be complacent. The immediate target is to beat Vietnam, which will be difficult but not impossible. \"We are at least as good, if not better [than Vietnam]. We've had a good preparation and many of our players are in good form, especially 'Mui' Teerasil Dangda, the Muangthong United striker who has sharpened our attack.\" The Thai side leave for Hanoi tomorrow. 95 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:11:23.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
