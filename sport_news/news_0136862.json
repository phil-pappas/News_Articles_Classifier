The defense played very well, we were running the ball. I was very happy with the way that they played today.' \nPequannock head coach \nEd Kopp \nNEWTON â€“ Pequannock head coach Ed Kopp knows that there is no such thing as a perfect high school football game. \nSure every coach dreams of the day that his players do everything correct and things go exactly as planned, but every coach also knows that the perfect game is unrealistic. \n\"You are dealing with 16 and 17-year old kids and their emotions,\" said Kopp on Friday night after the Panthers improved to 6-1 with a 28-7 win over Newton. \"There is always things that you strive for. You always want that perfect game that never happens.\" \nIn the first 24 minutes the Panthers played a nearly flawless first half as they jumped out to a 21-0 lead. \n\"After a long bus ride we were not sure what was going to happen but I was really happy with the way the kids responded. The defense played very well, we were running the ball,\" said Kopp. \"I was very happy with the way that they played today.\" \nLed by senior quarterback Tom Crooks the Pequannock offense was hitting on all cylinders in the first half as they scored on three of their four first half drives. \n\"Our o-line was getting their blocks and opening big holes, everything was just going our way [in the first half],\" said Crooks who rushed for all three touchdowns. \"When I see green in front of me it is great and when I can score there is nothing better then that.\" \nThe second half was a different story for the Panthers as Pequannock struggled to put together a solid drive as they were doomed by penalties and a Newton defensive front that seemed determined to slow the Pequannock attack. \n\"Newton did something's on defense and we did not do something's as well as we did in the first half,\" said Kopp. \"It is hard to get yourself up for the second half when you are up 21-0.\" \nAfter a scoreless third quarter Newton got on the board early in the fourth quarter and then forced the Panthers into a three-and-out and at that point it seemed as if the home team was gaining confidence and stealing the games momentum. \nThe Pequannock defense then stole back the momentum as they stopped the Newton attack on a fourth and 11 attempt from the Braves 23 yard line. \nOn the Panthers first play from scrimmage after the ball was turned over on downs sophomore Sean Klimek went 27-yards for a touchdown that seemed to squelch the Braves come from behind attempt. \n\"I think we just got a little overconfident and we did not play them as tough as we did in the first half and they took advantage of it,\" said Crooks who is happy with where the Panthers are through seven games. \"We are almost guaranteed a playoff spot and things are going good.\" \nThe Panthers can now turn their attention to Mountain Lakes who was 4-2 heading into yesterday's game at Wallkill Valley. \n\"This is a big game and it is for the division we have to practice hard. It is the biggest week of our season,\" said Crooks. \nKopp added, \"you know that Mountain Lakes will always give their best.\" \nEmail: costelloj@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:45:21.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
