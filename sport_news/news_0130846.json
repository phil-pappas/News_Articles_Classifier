Most Spurs fans have staked their tents firmly in the \"championship or bust\" camp, and it appears Vegas has joined.\nAt 4/1, the Spurs have the second-best odds to win the NBA championship, trailing only LeBron's Cavaliers (2/1), who mocked the the luxury tax threshold this summer by spending hundreds of millions to keep the King in a position to compete for a crown.\nPhoto: AFP/Getty Images Bet: 2015-2016 NBA Champion Odds: 4/1 Source: Las Vegas Superbook at... Image 3 of 11 Bet: Western Conference Champion Odds: Spurs 2/1 Source: Bovada\nA team generally expected to, at the least, make it to the NBA Finals, should also be the prohibitive favorite to capture the Western Conference title. The Warriors (3/1) won't sink so easily, though. The young team by the Bay is looking to establish a dynasty of its own, and they'll likely have to go through San Antonio to do so.\nPhoto: Nathaniel S.

Image 5 of 11 Bet: Rookie of the Year Odds: Nikola Milutinov +20500 Source: 5Dimes\nThere's a reason why Nikola Milutinov is the darkest of horses in the Rookie of the Year race: the 20-year-old Serbian isn't even on the Spurs' roster. San Antonio's 2015 first-round pick is stashed overseas, playing for European power Olympiacos.\nThese odds will eventually be updated, and though Brobdingnagian Croatian rookie Boban Marjanovic could sneak his way onto the bottom rungs of the list, you'd be better off spending your money on almost anything else.\nPhoto: Chris Covatta, Chris Eudaily Using Getty Images Bet: Rookie of the Year Odds: Nikola Milutinov +20500 Source:. .. Image 6 of 11 Bet : Regular Season MVP Odds : Kawhi Leonard +3300, LaMarcus Aldridge +3300, Tim Duncan +15000, Tony Parker +15000 Source : Ladbrokes\nLeonard is 24, but his list of accomplishments already reads like that of a hoops legend: NBA Champion, NBA Finals MVP, Defensive Player of the Year. There are just two items missing from his enviable collection of accolades and awards: All-Star selection and regular-season MVP.\nIf the Spurs approach the 70-win threshold and Leonard can sniff 20 points per game, he'll garner recognition, though splitting votes with the more offensively-minded Aldridge could diminish his chances.\nBet : Regular Season MVP Odds : Kawhi Leonard +3300, LaMarcus Aldridge... Image 7 of 11 Bet : Scoring champion Odds : LaMarcus Aldridge +3300 Source : 888sport\nSince the 1999-2000 season, the lowest points per game average to capture a scoring title was 27.71 by Kevin Durant. No Spur has averaged more than 22 a game over the past decade.\nAldridge has seen his scoring average jump from 21.1 to 23.4 over the past three seasons, but that increase hasn't been enough to crack even the top-five.\nThe \"Spurs Way\" isn't built on the back of prolific bucket-getters, rather, it's built on decisive ball movement and singular imagination. The men above Aldridge, including Kevin Durant at +250, all play in systems more tailored to individual offensive greatness.\nPhoto: Jerry Lara /San Bet : Scoring champion Odds : LaMarcus Aldridge +3300 Source :... Image 8 of 11 Bet : Blocks leader Odds : Tim Duncan +3300 Source : 888sports\nThe gray may be sneaking into the hair sprouting from his temples and chin, but the defensive stylings of Tim Duncan have yet to fade.\nLast year, at age 38, Duncan averaged 2.0 blocks, the highest mark for a player in their age-38 season. Duncan doesn't have the mobility or agility of his youth, but his dexterity and instinct remain two of the sharpest tools in the game.\nBet : Blocks leader Odds : Tim Duncan +3300 Source : 888sports\nThe gray... Image 9 of 11 Bet : Rebounding Champion Odds : LaMarcus Aldridge +3300 Source : 888sports\nBetween Aldridge, Duncan and Leonard, it doesn't feel like there will be enough rebounds going around to catapult any Spur into the NBA's rebounding hierarchy.\nAldridge averaged 11.1 and 10.2 rebounds over the past two seasons, respectively, but last year's leader, DeAndre Jordan, snagged an absurd 14.95 per game.\nPhoto: Jerry Lara /San Bet : Rebounding Champion Odds : LaMarcus Aldridge +3300 Source :... Image 10 of 11 Bet : Winning state Odds : Texas +350 Source : Ladbrokes\nLadbrokes lists just five options for this particular prop bet: California +300, Texas +350, Florida +2500, New York +12500 and Field -150.\nTexas stocks the bettor with the Spurs, Rockets and Mavericks, while California represents the defending-champion Warriors, the lowly kings, the fallen Lakers and the Chris Paul-led Clippers.\nThe Mavericks, Lakers and Kings are essentially inconsequential throw-ins that just so happen to reside in a state with true contenders. The money here is on the Spurs-Rockets and Warriors-Clippers to emerge.\nPhoto: San Bet : Winning state Odds : Texas +350 Source : Ladbrokes\nLadbrokes lists... Image 11 of 11 Spurs bets for 2015-2016 NBA season 1 / 11 Back to Gallery The Spurs had an offseason the likes of which the organization has never seen before â€” Vegas took notice.\nThe Las Vegas Superbook at the Westgate released its NBA over/unders on victory totals for the 2015-2016 NBA season on Wednesday and the Spurs, justifiably, find themselves near the top of the mountain.\nThe Spurs 58.5 over/under line ranks second only to the defending champion Golden State Warriors, who come in at 60.5 after winning 67 a year ago.\nAs the season draws near, more obscure bets will emerge, but several sites already have odds up on a number of awards and titles. Here's a look at nine more Spurs-related bets you can place prior to the season.\nScroll through the slideshow to see what kind of odds the Spurs are saddled with to win everything from the Larry O'Brien trophy to Rookie of the Year.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter : @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/27/15/8221550/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/60/8707093/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/54/04/7782661/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/42/8325286/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/42/8325278/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/61/8678507/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/30/26/7439789/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/55/8575862/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/27/15/8221550/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/55/55/8575862/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/54/04/7782661/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/42/8325278/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/74/8707844/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/74/8707844/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/60/42/8325286/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/74/8707843/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/06/61/8678507/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/30/26/7439789/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/60/8707093/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/74/8707843/11/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:32:05.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
