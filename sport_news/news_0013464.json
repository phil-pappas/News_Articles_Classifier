In the country, 63 places have such a high flagpole and now Kullu will be one of them. This was stated by Deputy Commissioner Rakesh Kanwar today. He said it would be the first such flag in the state. “The monument will be dedicated to the courage and valour of Indian soldiers,” he said. The Tricolour would be hoisted near Dev Sadan in front of Rath Ground and the area would be developed as a multi-purpose cultural complex in the future, the DC said. “The site of the flag will become a popular destination and make every Indian feel proud,” he said. The 20 X30 National Flag will fly high on the flagpole. It weighs 9 kg and is made of knitted polyester fabric called ‘Deneir Polyester’ manufactured in Mumbai. The Chakra has been printed by using specialised printing process. The National Flag of the dimension of 20 feet X 30 feet is known as ‘Monumental Flag’, which is not lowered at the sunset as it is properly illuminated at night. The Ministry of Home Affairs had taken a policy decision on December 23, 2009, which allowed the National Flag to fly day and night on a flagpole having a height of 100 feet and above with illumination. The DC said the cost of the flag was estimated to be Rs 14 lakh, out of which the NHPC Stage-II had contributed Rs 6 lakh and the remaining amount had been contributed by the District Cultural Council, Kullu. He thanked AK Singh, GM, NHPC Stage-II, for extending help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:04:11.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
