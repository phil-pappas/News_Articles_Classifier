The only thing missing was Bush, whose absence since being diagnosed with ovarian cancer last week has been felt beyond the volleyball community. \nPhoto gallery: St. Johns CD at Bolles \nBolles’ 3-0 win (25-15, 25-20, 25-22) over St. Johns Country Day marked the third with longtime assistant Allison Denmark filling in for Bush since her diagnosis. While October highlights breast cancer, Bolles’ players and a good portion of the crowd wore all blue to promote awareness for ovarian cancer and the battle that Bush, in her 30th year with a 668-281 record, is fighting. \n“My sister rang the bell last year [to signal the end of her chemotherapy] on cancer,” Denmark said. “We see her ringing the bell, too. I went through that with my sister and now my good friend. Elise has a diagnosis. She’s going to fight and going to battle it. It does not have her.” \nThe Bulldogs (20-3)haven’t needed any extra motivation. They’ve been one of the area’s most dominant and consistent teams all season and continued that against St. Johns, which entered on a 12-game winning streak. \nThey cooled off the red-hot Spartans (19-4) behind a pair of big hitters in Brittney Rayfield and Riley Coonan and a stiff defense. \nRayfield put down a kill for Bolles’ first point of the game, then ripped the final one, a shot into the Spartans’ back row, to end it. Rayfield had 19 kills and Coonan 12 for the Bulldogs. \nIn between, it was plenty of Coonan off of one side and then Rayfield off of the other. When it wasn’t Coonan or Rayfield, it was Julian Glassman and Anastasia Scott on defense. They helped keep St. Johns middle and University of Miami-bound Madison Dill in check to the tune of just nine kills. \n“It’s been difficult for me; she’s been like my second mom,” Rayfield said of Bush. “She means a lot to the whole team. We’re playing for her.” \nBolles will continue to play for Bush, although they will shift the attention to breast cancer on Thursday when it visits area No. 1 Bishop Kenny in the annual Pink Out match. \n“She’s been a mentor to me and an icon in the volleyball world in Jacksonville,” St. Johns coach Traci Livingston said of Bush. “She’s a great person. The community is behind her. Anything to help, prayers or whatever, we’ll do. This is awareness for our girls, for others. We can use this and learn.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:09:01.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
