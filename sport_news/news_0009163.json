Add those factors to the emotions sure to feature on Friday night in Tiger and you have the makings of something special indeed. \n( NOTE: For a look at all of the contests set for Week 8, simply click here .) \n“We really haven’t talked to (our players) about what this game’s about, but they know. Kids are smart, and they know what this is about,” Panthers coach Brian Allison said. “They didn’t need me talking about it or the coaches talking about it.” \n“Saying ‘Union County,’ that says it all to Rabun County people, so (our fans) will be out in full force,” said Wildcats coach Lee Shaw, whose team owns a 34-16 lead in the series, including a three-game win streak. “It will be a playoff atmosphere, which our guys are used to, and they’re excited about having a big game at our house.” \nCertainly both squads feature postseason-caliber talent, including Union County and Richmond University-bound quarterback Joseph Mancuso and Rabun County and University of Georgia-bound safety/receiver Charlie Woerner -- though the two standouts are far from alone, as evidenced by both teams’ play this season. \nSixth-ranked Union County (7-0, 3-0 Region 8-AA) has overwhelmed foes with its spread attack this season, averaging 41 points per game thanks in large part to Mancuso targeting teammates Sam Gilbert (31 receptions, 729 yards, 7 TDs), Cole Wright (20 receptions, 221 yards, 3 TDs), Knox Kiernan (16 receptions, 235 yards, 4 TDs) and Josh Daniel (12 receptions, 235 yards, 1 TD). But the senior – who has passed for 1,598 yards (228.3 per game, 57 percent completion rate) and 17 TDs against just 3 interceptions – has also developed into a consistent running threat in the Panthers’ spread attack, rushing for 825 yards and 11 scores. Bo Lynch has also shared the ground game burden, rushing for 417 yards and 5 TDs. \n“I think we knew last year that Joseph could run the football, but we had Chase (Barnett), and we put our running game on Chase’s shoulders and let him take control of it,” Allison said. “And this year we’ve done it with Joe, who’s done a great job running the football week-in, week-out. Then last week Bo Lynch stepped in there and had a great game rushing the football with 190 yards. And we’re able to spread it out a little bit, and when we’re able to run it opens that passing game up a little bit more. I think we’re a little bit different on offense this year as well because of that.” \nThe seventh-ranked Wildcats (6-1, 3-0) have also evolved in their own spread attack. And while Woerner is still an integral piece, leading the team in receptions (23 receptions, 335 yards, 5 TDs) despite sitting out last week’s game with an injury (he will play this week), Rabun features many more weapons than even last year’s Region 8-AA champion that reached the second round of the state playoffs. \n“It’s as balanced as it’s been since I’ve been up here. It kind of reminds me of the days when I was at Flowery Branch when we were balanced,” Shaw said. “But that’s directly in effect with the fact our offensive line has gotten better. Now it’s kind of coming to a head. Up front’s doing really well. We’re throwing to seven-eight-nine different receivers every ball game. We’re rolling some running backs in there. It’s not a one-man show. We’ve got a lot of cogs to this that are in synch right now.” \nAt the center of an offensive machine scoring 35.8 points per game is sophomore quarterback Bailey Fisher. A dual threat in his own right (1,418 yards passing, 15 TDs, 3 interceptions; 437 yards rushing, 4 TDs), the underclassmen is taking ownership of Shaw’s offense and has drawn high praise from his coach – who has even likened facets of his play to former stars Jaybo and Connor Shaw, who starred as signal callers in the same system at Flowery Branch. \n“I’m really comfortable with it right now thanks to coach J (Jaybo Shaw) just helping me learn the offense and then going to all those 7-on-7s over the summer, so I’m really comfortable with it,” said Fisher, who is looking forward to matching skills with Mancuso. “It’s definitely fun competing against him. He’s accomplished a lot of stuff over there at Union the past three years. I feel like this can get my name out there, competing against him.” \nFisher is surrounded by a stellar supporting cast as well, including receivers Dillyn Nichols (22 receptions, 330 yards, 3 TDs), Jack Johnson (15 receptions, 308 yards, 3 TDs), Alden Wright (9 receptions, 144 yards, 4 TDs) and Tristan Huggins (9 receptions, 204 yards, 1 TD), as well as running backs Eli Gipson (454 yards rushing, 5 TDs) and Cal Drummond (339 yards rushing, 7 TDs). \nIn other words, both defenses will have their hands full – though each is looking forward to the challenge. \n“I don’t think you stop Union County. Hopefully we can figure out a way to slow them down,” said Shaw, who’s defense has shut down several foes this season, allowing just 7.8 points per game, which includes three shutouts. \nMiddle linebacker Rhodes Jones paces the Wildcats with 10.3 tackles per game, while Woerner averages 7.2 stops per game. \nUnion County, meanwhile, enters the contest yielding 18.1 points per game, with outside linebacker Luke Winkler (15.5 tackles per game) and middle linebacker Christopher Thompson (13.8 tackles per game) proving extremely active. \n“Defensively, they’re running a 3-4 scheme that’s very well-coached, and they fly around to the ball,” Shaw said. “They’re a very good football team. We’ve got our hands full.” \nThe Panthers hope to show just that, as their seniors look to avoid going winless against the Wildcats. \n“I think we’re going to have a big turnaround, and it’s going to mean a lot to us when we’re out on the field Friday night,” said Union County senior lineman Chris Drost. \nAnd while the winner will not clinch a region crown – Washington-Wilkes is still undefeated in 8-AA play as well – it will most certainly gain the inside track to the title. \n“We’ve got a lot of football left to play after this game,” Allison said. “This game means a lot, but we can’t put all of our eggs in this one basket.\" \nThere’s no doubt this game carries plenty of weight – and, this time, it could mean a lot to the rest of Class AA as well. \n“Both teams are undefeated in region play, natural old mountain rivals, top 10 teams, which is great for both our mountain communities. It’s just a big game all in itself, and we’re not going to try and hide from that fact,” Shaw said. “It is the next game on the schedule, but it is a big game for us. We know it has region implications for a championship -- of course we have Washington-Wilkes and Greene County still (to play) for us, but this Union County game is huge for us.” \n“It’s a big game; the whole community’s excited about this game,” Mancuso added. “A lot of people are going to be coming, so we’re looking forward to it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:16:38.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
