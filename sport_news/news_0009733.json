The blood starts churning at the start of the season, when you see the action of the Premier League on the telly. You see the conflicts and difficulties some managers have had - some good, some bad, some unexpected. \n\"The lure of the manager's job is the responsibility, the challenge. It's the experience gained going in amongst players and saying 'I want to make you better lads, and want you to enjoy working together'. I don't consider it to be work. \n\"We've got to go out and entertain the people who pay to watch and that should be a pleasure. Millions of people play football as a pastime at the end of a hard week, and pay subs to do it, and we're going out, doing what we love doing and being paid for it.\" \nAllardyce was asked whether he feared he'd have ended up being forgotten, having been out of work since leaving the Hammers in May. He replied: \"I think another opportunity would have come along, but you don't have too long before you get forgotten.\" \nMagee reminded Dudley-born Allardyce how Harry Redknapp - another former Hammers manager - had once said he was \"too rough and too northern for West Ham\". \n\"Harry Redknapp got as much stick at West Ham as I did,\" said Allardyce. \"I think that's why he said what he did, because that's what West Ham fans thought of me. I don't think that was the case. \n\"Since I left there I've bumped into lots of West Ham fans and had lots of messages from supporters who did appreciate me and the achievements of the team. I had a great time there and my four years were not a failure by any stretch. I had a great time.\" \nAllardyce explained the circumstances under which he left West Ham, saying: \"Small pockets of people were being disruptive - particularly on social media - and that's life these days. \n\"A small number of people can create a lot of problems if they're constant and persistent and unfortunately, in the end, people tend to listen to it and believe it. \n\"The two Davids [Gold and Sullivan] and Karren [Brady] had for some reason made their mind up about my future and in all honesty, so had I. They just hadn't told me and I hadn't told them - that's the bottom line. We then went our separate ways. The time was right and off I went.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:41:25.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
