(John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nAfter recently watching video of last season’s Week 3 game at Philadelphia , Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins said he was encouraged by the progress he has made in the year since. Cousins completed 30 of 48 throws for 427 yards in the 37-34 defeat , including three touchdowns and one fourth-quarter interception. \nWhat struck him, as he reviewed video as part of his preparations for Sunday’s game against the Eagles at FedEx Field, was his unpolished footwork and the number of plays he didn’t make. \n“It was a productive game offensively,” Cousins recalled Wednesday, “but boy, we left a lot of plays out there.” \nThe Redskins bolted to a 17-7 lead in that early season-contest and outgained the Eagles 511 to 379 yards. An 81-yard catch and run to wide receiver DeSean Jackson knotted the score at 27 each in the third quarter. \nBut the Eagles surged ahead in the fourth quarter, while Cousins, making his first start in relief of the injured Robert Griffin III, was intercepted by safety Malcolm Jenkins on a deep throw intended for tight end Niles Paul. \nJenkins is part of an improved Eagles defense that this season is tied for third in the NFL in total takeaways (eight), including five interceptions in three games. The Redskins defense has yet to get an interception. \n[ Redskins haven’t fixed their turnover issues, but Eagles seem to have ] Kirk Cousins scrembles against the Rams. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nAsked Wednesday in what way he felt he had grown in the 12 months since facing the Eagles last September, Cousins said: “I thought my footwork was pretty inconsistent (in 2014). I thought some of my decision-making or just my overall procedure of playing the quarterback position was inconsistent at times. I came away from watching that film feeling it’s encouraging to see how far I’ve improved.” \nThe Redskins and Eagles are each 1-2 heading into Sunday’s game at FedEx Field. \nIn his three starts this season, Cousins has completed 69.2 percent of his throws, taken just four sacks and moved the offense well. But he has thrown three touchdown passes to four interceptions — two of those coming in last Thursday’s 32-21 loss to the New York Giants. \nCoach Jay Gruden on Wednesday reiterated his confidence in Cousins, saying the goal was “gradual improvement.” \nNoting that the Redskins were one game out of first place in an unsettled NFC East, Gruden said of Cousins: “He has done some good things. I don’t know if we’re expecting him to be 25 for 30 and 420 yards and five touchdowns every week. We’re hoping for gradual improvement. I think he has shown enough in the first three games so far that he is improving.” \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:12:56.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
