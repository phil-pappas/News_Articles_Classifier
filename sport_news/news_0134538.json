Shipley, 31, got pretty good deals on pretrial release in separate federal criminal cases. And both managed to screw up rather quickly.\nBoucher was arrested late last year on charges of mail theft, bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.\nBoucher was released pending trial to the custody of La Posada Halfway House in Albuquerque on Dec. 4, 2014. A week later, the federal probation office asked for an arrest warrant because Boucher’s urine sample tested positive for opiates. He was arrested shortly after the warrant was issued.\nBOUCHER: Two chances at pretrial release\nSHIPLEY: Posted $1,000 cash before trial\nBoucher was given a second chance at pretrial release. He was placed into the third-party custody of his mother so he could go to a 28-day drug rehabilitation program in Roswell.\nHe eventually entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to 39 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Boucher was also ordered to pay restitution to the victims of his crimes.\nShipley was arrested in the spring of 2014 in Otero County on trafficking in methamphetamine and possession of firearms during a drug trafficking crime after his associates got stopped at a Border Patrol checkpoint.\nShipley was released to the custody of a relative in Arizona under conditions that he follow all the rules set out by the probation office.\nIn addition, he posted $1,000 cash – deposited with the court as 10 percent of a $10,000 bond. Such deposits are uncommon in federal court.\nShipley was released in May 2014. In June, probation officers checked with his third-party custodian, who said he had taken Shipley to meet with his attorney in Portales and hadn’t seen Shipley since.\nHe was rearrested.\nUnlike Boucher, Shipley didn’t get a second chance. He was locked up pending resolution of his case.\nShipley was sentenced in federal court in Las Cruces to eight years in prison for his methamphetamine trafficking and firearms convictions and will be on supervised release for three years after completing his prison sentence.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_11oct_shipley-131x175.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_11oct_boucher-158x175.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:25:34.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
