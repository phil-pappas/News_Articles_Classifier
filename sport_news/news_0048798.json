Chase drivers took nine of the top 10 spots on the speed chart in the final practice for the second race in NASCAR’s playoffs. \nKahne topped the morning practice at 160.506 as both sessions where shortened by rain. Rain wiped out practice and qualifying on Friday. \nThe field was set on points and Matt Kenseth will start first Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:16:31.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
