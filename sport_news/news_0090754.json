Overall, we're older now. Coach Wood has talked about maturity. We know a lot more football (this year) and coaches can be more detail-oriented.\" \nWith much expected from Hale this season, the pressure will be high. But that seems unlikely to affect Hale, given his competitive fire. He want to win so badly -- at everything -- that his friends won't even play video games with him anymore. \nHis distaste for losing complements his physical gifts and cerebral approach. \n\"I'm good in coverage,\" Hale said. \"A lot of people don't regard safeties as cover guys, but it's what I do well. I'm a student of the game. I know the game. I'm tough, physical, fearless. I like to go out there, have fun and be fearless.\" \nNot surprisingly, Hale wants to be remembered for his toughness, a quality that always leaves an impression on coaches. While his impact at Salisbury may be minimized by his short tenure there, it appears that he has already begun leaving his mark. \n\"I am extremely pleased to have Mike as a member of our team,\" Wood said. \"He is a winner and true competitor. He has instilled leadership and serves as a mentor for our program.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:39:15.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
