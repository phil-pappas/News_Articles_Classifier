The region was hit by torrential downpours of rain 48 hours prior to the meeting. \nConditions were far from ideal as track staff repeatedly sent out machinery to try amd make the conditions better for the two teams. \nSpills and falls played their part in a number of heat outcomes and both sets of riders deserve plenty of credit for just attempting to race initially. \nIn a meeting that constantly swung from one way to the other, it looked as though the Heathens were going to get off to the best possible start. \nSkipper Max Clegg and guest Danny Ayres sat on a 5-1 maximum for the first two laps of the opening race. \nHowever, Clegg struggled to find a racing line that suited him and was eventually passed by both Eastbourne riders for a share of the spoils. \nTyler Govier and guest reserve Jack Smith missed the gate on a night where making a good start was imperative and found themselves on the receiving end of a 5-1 to give the visitors an early lead. \nHeat three saw the hosts bounce back instantly with a 5-1 of their own. IS THIS THE END OF THE ROAD? Fans at Cradley Heathens last home meeting of the season. Picture by Jonathan Hipkiss. \nCradley Heathens 30: Danny Ayres 9, Arron Mogridge 8+3, Max Clegg 6, Matt Williamson 4, Jack Smith 2+1, Tyler Govier 1. \nEastbourne 30: Richard Andrews 7+2, Marc Owen 7+1, Bradley Wilson-Dean 5, Kelsey Dugard 4+1, Martin Knuckey 4, Ben Hopwood 3. \nIn-form Arron Mogridge held off the Eastbourne duo to collect a paid win while Ayres made it two out of two at the front. \nMatt Williamson looked comfortable in the lead in heat four, but a spill on bend four gifted the Eagles their second maximum heat advantage of the night. \nAn exclusion for Ayres after falling in the fifth saw Eastbourne pull six points clear on the night. \nMogridge combined for his second 5-1 of the meeting for Cradley, this time with a fired up and much more determined Clegg. \nHowever, Eastbourne would extend their lead further going into the interval with two more heat advantages. \nWilliamson missed the gate, but gave it his all to work his way into second. But a mistake coming out of bend four saw him re-passed by Marc Owen as Eastbourne secured their third 5-1. \nHeat eight was awarded as a 4-2 to the Eagles after Tyler Govier came to grief while in third place.
