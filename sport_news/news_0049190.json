(Matt Smith | For lehighvalleylive.com) By Brad Wilson | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 09, 2015 2:43 PM \nPalisades at Wilson , Saturday, 1:30 p.m. \nAttitude and energy. Wilson may be 1-4, but the Warriors have been in most of their games and finally broke through with a dramatic 21-20 win at Catasauqua Friday night. Palisades (2-3), physical and powerful, offers a more stringent test than Catty did. But Wilson sophomore quarterback Cameron Clark said the Warriors have the key to victory in their hands. “We have to bring the energy we had at Catasauqua back, but even more so than last week,” he said. “We had a lot of energy and played well as a team. We have to stay focused and play as a team to get the job done.” \nOffensive lune has to be Warriors. Wilson coach Matt Senneca said his o-line “won the game for us” last week and it will be even more critical against a Pirate defense that, according to Seneca, “flies around and always has multiple guys around the ball, and their physicality is a big challenge for us.” But Wilson’s offensive line of tight ends Brian Huber and Terrance Mainor (the Warriors used two-TE sets often), tackles Logan Grube and Jarim Kozemchak, guards Koti Figueroa and Trevor Loebsack , and center Zach Febbo answered Senneca’s challenge last week as the team ran for over 300 yards. If they can do the same this week, Wilson will be in good shape. With running back Job Goodman (452 yards, 4 TDs) and Clark (231 yards, 2 TDs) both averaging over 5 yards a carry, big blocks could mean big plays as well. \nTwo-half football. Wilson has had a habit this season of playing just one half of good football. It’s hard to win that way, but Friday finally saw a full game from the Warriors. “I knew they had it in them, but I hadn’t seen it for all 48 minutes,” Senneca said, “They proved to me they can do that Friday.” Another such effort will be required Saturday. \nPalisades offensive consistency. The Pirates have scored just one touchdown in regulation over their last two games against Palmerton and Northern Lehigh. Palisades has had trouble scoring points – they managed just a safety against Salisbury – although they did drop 48 on Catasauqua. One touchdown will not get it done against Wilson; 48 points probably will. The likelihood is somewhere in between; it says here that 28 points will be enough to win. \nHome cooking. Wilson has one of the better fan bases in the Colonial League, and Warrior fans tend to come out in respectable numbers even when the team isn’t undefeated and atop the league. The team would like to give the home fans a win as they shoot for a successful October and November and they love the support they get. “It really helps when we have all the people cheering all the big plays we make,” Clark said. The more fans in the stands Saturday, the better chance the Warriors win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:18:19.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
