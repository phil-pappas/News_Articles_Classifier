Lee and Riverheads helped themselves quite a bit this week in the VHSL’s weekly football ratings. \nThe Cougars remain at No. 2 in 2A East after their 47-0 win over Stonewall Jackson, while the Leemen moved up from 12th to ninth, thanks to their win over 3A school Broadway. The Bison, last week’s No. 1, fell to fifth in the region. \nThe Gladiators, who rallied to beat previously unbeaten Gap last Thursday, moved up to No. 1 in Group 1A East ahead of Essex, which fell to No. 2. \nIn 3A West, Waynesboro fell two spots to No. 13 after its loss to Harrisonburg last week. \nThe ratings, which determine the teams in each region that will advanced to postseason play, are an average of points from a formula that includes opponents’ classification, in-district or out-of-district status, and wins and losses by teams already beaten or defeated. \nThe top 16 teams in 2A East and 3A West qualify for the postseason. The top 12 teams in 1A East make the playoffs, with the top four seeds receiving first-round byes. \nStuarts Draft (4-1) has a 19.80 rating, placing it behind new No. 1 Goochland (20.25), which was seventh last week before hammering Randolph-Henry last week 49-28. Clark County (19.60) is third, with the Bison and Amelia County tied for fourth with 19.40. \nStuarts Draft visits Buffalo Gap on Friday in a game that is sure to shake up next week’s ratings. \nLee improved its rating from 14.20 to 16.50 to make its move into the top 10. The Leemen are .30 points behind Strasburg, which fell to No. 8 after being tied for third with Clarke County last week, and could make another jump in the ratings with a Homecoming win Friday over 3A Waynesboro. \nIt was a tough week for Wilson Memorial, which dropped from a tie for 17th last week to No. 21 with an average of 12.00. The Green Hornets are 1.88 points behind No. 16 Madison County. \nRiverheads’ win over the Bison, combined with Essex’s 35-6 loss on the road at Monroe in Fredericksburg, put the Gladiators in the top spot with a 24.00 rating. The Trojans’ average fell to 22.40 to put them in the No. 2 spot, with Franklin (20.50), Luray (19.00) and Lancaster (18.80) rounding out the top five. Stonewall Jackson held on to the No. 16 spot in the region. \nThe Little Giants’ rating in 3A West dipped from 18.00 last week to 16.67 this week. Brookville, Magna Vista, Western Albemarle, Staunton River and Abingdon make up the top five in the region. \nWeekly Rankings as of Oct. 7 \nGroup 2A East \n1. Goochland 20.25, 2.
