(AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton is running into Democratic voters who have questions about her character and her commitment to the liberal values they hold dear.\nIt's happening at ice cream shops and book stores, and summer fairs and fall festivals.\nDemocrats want to keep the White House in the party's hands. But there's ambivalence about the former secretary of state and New York senator who's the front-runner for the nomination.\nVoters interviewed by The Associated Press in New Hampshire and Iowa had lots of concerns.\nSome are skeptical of Clinton's positions on income inequality and Wall Street regulation. Others question her honesty and how she handles controversy.\nMany say they feel there's a lack of a connection with Clinton, often for reasons they cannot seem to explain.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
