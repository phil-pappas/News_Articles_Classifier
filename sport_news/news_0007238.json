As his teammates ended the session with shooting and conditioning work, the guard walked along the sideline with a wrap on his knee, moving well enough to celebrate an exciting finish to the drill. \nStevens said he expects Rozier to miss three to five days, which could put his status in jeopardy for at least one preseason game this week. The Celtics play Wednesday at Brooklyn and Friday at New York. \nStevens did not explain what caused the swelling, but knee tendinitis has bothered Rozier periodically since his time at Louisville. Over the offseason, he said the issue popped up again after he competed for the Celtics in two summer leagues. He took two weeks of rest before returning to the court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:18:37.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
