Their training times have been moved so they are not on the ice with the national team. \nThe division is a blow to a sports organization that has produced more Olympic medals for Canada — 35 — than any other sport. \nSpeed Skating Canada defends the restructuring, saying change was needed after the team’s disappointing performance in Sochi. Canada won just two medals — both by Denny Morrison — down from five at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver and eight at the 2006 Olympics in Turin. \nLong gone are the days of Cindy Klassen, Jeremy Wotherspoon, Clara Hughes, Kristina Groves and Christine Nesbitt gobbling up medals for Canada on the international circuit. \nIn hopes of turning the tide, Speed Skating Canada launched a four-month review before undergoing a structural overhaul earlier this year to create a new athlete development plan. The changes left some skaters without a dedicated coach; others were asked to change coaches. Not everyone liked the decisions. Among those who chose to leave and form their own team were Olympians Kali Christ, Kaylin Irvine, Anastasia Buscis and Shannon Rempel. \n“It’s a little bit uncomfortable in some cases, because people who in the past used to talk to each other and look each other in the eyes, are not,” says Brian Rahill, the high performance director for Speed Skating Canada. “It’s unfortunate they’ve decided to behave that way, but no one is holding any type of grudge. We’re just disappointed this is the course the individuals have decided to go.” \nTeam Crossover is coached by Brock Miron, who worked until this year as a talent identification and development coach for Speed Skating Canada. \nChrist, a 23-year-old old who finished fifth in the 1,500-metre race at the 2013 world single distance championships, said the move gives her the best chance of success. \n“I decided I needed to do something,” she says. “For me, it was a hard choice.” \nChrist had worked for many years under coach Todd McClements, but was moved to another group under the new structure. \n“I was given a coach by SSC, but for me, personally, it just wasn’t working out. There wasn’t a super-strong connection.” \nIrvine, 25, used to work with Xiuli Wang before she was ordered to switch. \nBuscis, a two-time Olympian, took last year off to study communications at McGill University. She returned to discover “stage four” athletes — those ranked just outside the world’s top 10 — were left without a dedicated sprint coach. Rempel, a silver medallist at the 2006 Turin Games in team pursuit who is also attempting a comeback after taking a few years off, also found herself without a coach. \nRahill says he offered a compromise where Wang would still have considerable input into Irvine’s training and McClements would help with Christ’s program. \n“They decided, no, that wasn’t acceptable to them,” Rahill says. “That’s why they decided to go to Brock Miron and Team Crossover.” \nAs for the Rempel and Buscis? “We’re not going to give you grandfather status after four years out of the sport or a year out of the sport,” Rahill says. “We’re not going to grandfather you back into the system unless you prove you deserve it. They’re welcome back into the family if that’s the performance they demonstrate, but I can’t give this to you freely, because we’re moving to a performance-focused program rather than an entitlement program.” \nAs carded athletes, Christ and Irvine will continue to receive funding from Sport Canada but, due to the split, they are no longer eligible for support services like physiotherapy, massage therapy or sports psychology. The team is on the hunt for corporate sponsorship to help fund their quest for medals outside of the auspices of Speed Skating Canada. \nGiven the lack of support services, and changes in ice time, Miron says his athletes will be competing this weekend at a distinct disadvantage. \n“But we believe in what we’re doing,” he says. “We believe the team is the right training environment.” \nMiron says the team concept is popular in the Netherlands, which won 23 speed skating medals in Sochi. \n“Over in Holland, that is the way the system is run,” he says. “The Dutch national federation, their only goal is to work with their junior programs and make sure the development of the younger athletes happen. Once they get to 17 or 18 or 20, then the pro teams snap them up. In my opinion, that’s why the Dutch are so absolutely dominant, because they run this professional team system.” \nRahill also preaches team, he just believes in the one governed by Speed Skating Canada. \n“Obviously, we would like to see them come back to the program,” he says. “The door is always open.” \nCHRIST'S CROSSOVER CHANGES \nKali Christ is trying to find creative ways to make up for the support services lost by joining Team Crossover. \nThe 23-year-old switched this summer to the new professional team to work with coach Brock Miron, which leaves her without physiotherapy, sports psychology, massage therapy and other services normally provided for athletes by Speed Skating Canada. \n“My mom is actually a massage therapist,” says Christ, whose family lives an eight-hour drive away in Regina. “She’s been coming up to Calgary every few weeks and making sure I’m worked on and as many of my team members are also worked on. “ \nWhile tensions are evident between Speed Skating Canada officials and Team Crossover members, Christ says the reaction from the majority of her former teammates is generally one of understanding and acceptance. \n“Most of the athletes have been fine and supportive,” she said. “That’s all I care about and need.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:51:37.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
