While prudent folk shake their heads at what they consider the sheer idiocy of putting your life on the line for a short-lived thrill, adrenaline junkies continue to chase that elusive rush over high water, to great heights, over sheer rock faces, and to the darkest of forests. All for that transients into moments in which they feel truly and completely alive. Maybe it has got to do with confronting and surmounting fears. Or maybe it is just a dopamine addiction. People travel from one corner of the world to another in order to feel that adventure of being at the edge of life and death. One such location that is famous for all such activities is Africa, a dream destination of adventure seekers. Africa is a continent that is synonymous with wilderness, vast spaces, glorious sunsets, shimmering heat, an extensive variety of wildlife, an amazing diversity of cultures and almost inexplicable natural beauty. The hunting safari in South Africa makes this continent a rising star in the field of tourism. Whether you are looking for a classic safari, a private off-the-beaten-path journey, or a personal exploration of Africa's tribal cultures and rituals, there is simply no experience as captivating as visiting Africa. Africa's natural history alone would make a dozen visits worthwhile. Where else on Earth can you fall asleep with the sounds of lion roaring, or watch a million flamingos take off from the waters? Parts of South Africa boast scenery so spectacular they will blow your mind, but the essence of this incredible continent isn't in any desert, mountain or lake. The thrilling experience of hunting for lion, buffalo, white rhino, or elephant can only be witnessed in the jungles of South Africa. A safari, meaning a \"long journey\", especially in Africa, is defined as an overland journey. The South African hunting safaris was popularized by the US author Ernest Hemingway and President Theodore Roosevelt. A safari may consist of several days or even weeks-long journey, with camping in the bush or jungle, while pursuing big game. Nowadays, it is often used to describe tours through African national parks to watch or hunt wildlife. Hunters are basically tourists, accompanied by licensed and highly trained professional hunters, local guides, and porters in dangerous terrains. Over the years, South Africa has become a prime destination for hunters from all over the world looking to test their skills on African game. About the Author Author is an enthusiastic blogger.
