The four-time defending CSL champs had a two point edge over SIPG in the standings with three games to go -- so a win on the road over Tianjian Teda would go a long way in helping Ricardo Goulart and company to retaining their championship.Beautiful clear day in Tianjin for a soccer match -- Evergrande's Liu Jian's effort from outside the area is punched away by Yang Qipeng in the 37th minute as the game remains scoreless.Tianjin's Romanian striker Crisian Tanase tries to take advantage of Zeng Cheng's poor clearance but can't find the target.Elkeson would try and make a move down the left flank and earns his team a vital penalty just on the hour mark. He is brought down by Teda's Brazilian defender Lucas Fonseca.Recardo Goulart, also from Brazil, sends Yang Qipeng the wrong way giving Guangzhou a 1-nil lead.And the goal scorer would help increase the lead ten minutes from time, as he catches up to a through ball, and then chips the keeper to find the net and put his team in front 2-nil clever piece of skill from the Brazilian as he spots the goalie off his line and has the wits to place it over him. Goulart's 15th league goal of the season is second most in the league. Evergrande grab a 2-nil win. Draw dents Portsman's hopes of catching leaders Evergrande In other action SIPG was battling Shijiazhuang Everbright, and in the 5th minute Wu Lei is able to give his Shanghain club a lead as he beats the keeper.That lead is short lived as Jacob Mulenga's header helps Shijiazhuang draw level at 1-1.Right before the break, SIPG retake the lead -- as Wu Lei steers this square ball into the bak of the net. 2-1 game.SIPG need to win to try and close the gap on Evergrande, but some shoddy defending leads to Mulenga easily scoring his second goal. 2-2 is how it ends -- and now the Portsman are 4-points behind the leaders with two games to go -- all but blowing their chances of a title. \"Our defending in the last moments was a little loose, while the strategy of our opponents was to defend and counterattack, so we need to work out our problems,\" said Lu Wenjun, SIPG forward.Saturday's other matches featured Shanghai Shenhua thrashing Changchun Yatai 3-0, Beijing Guoan defeating Guangzhou R&F 2-0, Shandong Luneng beating Guizhou Renhe 5-2, and Jiangsu Sainty drawing 1-1 with Henan Jianye.In the standings, Guangzhou Evergrande extended their lead over second-place SIPG to four points, with two more CSL matches remaining for both teams, while Beijing Guoan remain in the third spot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:37:48.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
