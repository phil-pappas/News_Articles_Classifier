It came in the opening race of the second round of the Chase and earned him the automatic berth into the next round.

The series races next week at Kansas and then four drivers will be eliminated Oct. 25 at Talladega. \n\"It helps us sleep here the next couple of weeks,\" the Team Penske driver said. \"This helps us recharge our batteries and get ready for the next round.\" \nKevin Harvick, who routed the field last week at Dover to keep his title defense intact, finished second for the 11th time this season. He has been second to Logano three times, but considered it almost a victory because he felt the reigning Sprint Cup champions had struggled most of the weekend.

Jeff Gordon, making the final start of his career at Charlotte, struggled for the first half of the race but salvaged an eighth-place finish. \nLogano teammate Brad Keselowski staved off a loose wheel over the closing laps as Chase drivers took eight of the top nine spots.

From there, racing in traffic, he had contact with Ryan Newman that sent him into the wall. It was the first of many brushes with the wall for Kenseth, who also had to serve a penalty for too many crewmen working on his car during one of his stops for repairs. \nHe was finally put out of his misery when a broken part sent him into the wall — again — and to the garage. He finished 42nd and dropped to last in the Chase field.

One thing led to another and then another.\" \nThings weren't much better for teammate Busch, who started second and was one of the strongest cars for most of the race. \nBut running third when a caution forced teams to choose a pit strategy, he headed to pit road, then changed his mind at the very last second. Only problem? Kyle Larson, running second, decided at that moment he wanted to duck onto pit road.

He tried to continue on with damage to his Chevrolet, but a tire problem sent him into the wall again and to pit road for repairs on Lap 85. He was one lap down when his car was repaired and wound up 28th. \nHe's now in the bottom four in the standings. \nJimmie Johnson, who was eliminated from the Chase last week, was the best of the Hendrick group but suffered an engine issue late in the race and finished 39th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:24:49.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
