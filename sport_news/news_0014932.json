The 37 pages of records were released after an open records request from Press-Gazette Media. \nTwo men with Baudry also were arrested following a struggle with multiple officers who were trying to quell a disturbance near the end of the Green Bay Packers game. \"We were outnumbered by many drunks that were closing in on us,\" officer David Van Erem wrote. \nUltimately, four Green Bay officers and an off-duty Wauwatosa officer subdued the three men. \nBaudry \"was immediately telling me that I need to (expletive) come to him and that he was not going to come to us,\" Van Erem wrote. \"I told Baudry that he had been kicked out three times by the staff and he was screaming at me that he was not and he was getting very animated and ... raising his arms into a boxer's stance. \n\"Baudry was highly intoxicated and not making any sense with his comments.\" \nOfficers administered a breath test that showed Baudry had a blood-alcohol level of \"about 0.29,\" Van Erem wrote. \nThat's more than three times the level at which a person is legally intoxicated. He was charged with unlawful conduct at a public event and resisting an officer. \nPhone message left on Baudry's office and cellular numbers Wednesday were not immediately returned. \nBaudry's two companions refused the test. \nBoth also were charged with unlawful conduct, and with resisting. \nPolice said James M. Taraboi, 28, \"was fighting with officers\" during the incident. Officer Thomas Denney used a Taser to subdue him. Taraboi had puncture wounds from the Taser probes, but police said he declined medical attention. \nJoseph Taraboi, James' 32-year-old brother, tried to interfere with the arrest and repeatedly swore at officers, police said. \n\"Joseph came towards us again and told me again '(expletive) you,'\" Detective Mike Francois wrote. \"I then advised him he was under arrest. I then grabbed his right arm and he resisted me ... I then tried to get him to the ground as this other male, James, stepped in again and tried to pull him away from me.\" \nBaudry was booked at the Brown County Jail and released on $1,760 bond. Police said the brothers also were taken to jail, though there is no record on the jail's website of them being booked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:13:14.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
