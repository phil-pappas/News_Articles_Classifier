This is going to sit with us all forever - players, coaches, management. I don't think I'll ever come to terms with it personally because it was such a big thing. \n\"I've had some great moments coaching England and I've had some disappointing ones, but this pales everything else into insignificance because of what the tournament means to everyone. \n\"We lost two games, but they were crucial games and ultimately that let us down. It came down to the decision-making towards the end of the Wales game and some accuracy and execution at the end of the Australia game. That's what we'll be judged on and I understand that. \n\"I need some time, obviously and the RFU does as well. I think we'll make the right decision at the right time.\" \nLancaster has denied any division in the camp over the decision to fast-track league convert Sam Burgess into the international set-up, and he is confident of the players' backing once a post-tournament inquest begins in earnest. \n\"I would hope the players would be supportive in the review,\" he said. \n\"Clearly, I have invested a lot of time in one-to-one relationships with the players and I'd like to think I've got an open door where people can come in and tell me any problems and issues that arise.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:43:08.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
