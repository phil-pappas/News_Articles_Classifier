The hottest golfer in the world was convinced he had just lost the Presidents Cup for the United States. \n\nAfter leading his singles match against Marc Leishman from the outset, Spieth stumbled on the back nine, handing victory to the Australian. \n\nIt could not have come at a worse time with the Presidents Cup still in the balance but, like everything that has happened to Spieth this year, it all worked out in the end and he finished a winner. \n\nThe U.S. eventually won by a solitary point. And despite losing his singles match, Spieth was one of his team's star performers, earning three points. \n\n\"I really enjoy the team part of this. That's my favourite part about these matches,\" the 22-year-old Texan said. \n\n\"We play individual matches all the time. We play individual events all the time. But the team part of this was fantastic this week...I loved it.\" \n\nSpieth made his Presidents Cup debut in Ohio two years ago, selected as a captain's pick. The rookie picked up two points but lost his singles match to Canada's Graham DeLaet. \n\nHe also lost his Ryder Cup singles match to Graeme McDowell last year but was philosophical about losing another. \n\n\"I should have won. I should have won this for this team. I thought on 15 that I may lose us the Presidents Cup with a couple of shots that I hit,\" he said. \n\n\"Marc played great golf. 15, I handed it to him, but the other holes that were won were won because one of us won the hole. \n\n\"And Marc Leishman will win a major championship in my mind. I lost to a really good champion and a solid player.\" \n\nSpieth has been winning tournaments in pressure situations all year, including the Masters and the U.S. Open, where he beat Dustin Johnson. \n\nStill learning his way, the world number one teamed up with Johnson for three matches at the Presidents Cup, winning two, which proved critical in the final outcome. \n\n\"The biggest highlight of my week was yesterday, was our comeback with DJ when we were 3-down at the turn and 2-down with -- really 1-down with a couple to go,\" he said. \n\n\"That was a huge match, I think obviously for the team, because they were supposed to win that match. We instead, won that match, not only we tied, we won, but that flipped two points and ended up being a point difference.\" \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:39:00.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
