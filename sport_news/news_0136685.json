The Mustangs put together a solid effort in all phases of the game, made key plays and the result was a 23-12 victory over visiting Southern Boone. “I’m just ecstatic,” Eldon coach Shannon Jolley said. “Our kids played excellent and that is the best we have played all year for four quarters. I could not be more proud of those kids. They played together as a unit in all three phases of the game and I think they were truly one team tonight.” Eldon opened up the scoring early in the first quarter with a 1-yard touchdown from junior running back Trenton Kidwell. A botched Southern Boone punt put the Mustangs in good field position once again and Eldon added to their lead with senior Levi Shinn’s 25-yard field goal to go up 10-0 at the beginning of the second quarter. Southern Boone finally broke through on a 55-yard screen pass with 6:33 remaining in the half to make it 10-6. The Eagles were driving once more on their next possession before Eldon senior linebacker Chris Lemen recovered a fumble at the Eldon 41-yard line to end the drive and give the Mustang defense their second turnover on the night after senior defensive back Owen Tamm’s first quarter interception. Eldon picked up right where they left off after halftime and scored on their first two possessions. The Mustangs drove from their own 41-yard line and finished with a 24-yard field goal from Shinn. Southern Boone would fumble again in Eldon territory at the 45-yard line and Kidwell was the recipient this time around. The junior added his second touchdown on a 2-yard run and the Mustangs held a comfortable 20-6 advantage late in the third quarter. Kidwell said it felt good to contribute, but it was his teammates that made it possible. “I have the best guards ever and Shinn put us down there so I just finished it,” Kidwell said. “The offensive line communicates very well on what they are doing so we have a better understanding of what is going on and it helps us help them.” Southern Boone did not go quietly into the night. The Eagles put together a 97-yard drive and answered on a 3-yard touchdown pass with 5:15 remaining in the contest to cut the Eldon lead to 20-12. Southern Boone then stopped the Mustangs on a 4th-and-2 at the Eagle 48-yard line to get the ball back with 2:48 left to go and an opportunity to tie the game, but Lemen would answer the call once more for his team. Lemen was in the right place at the right time and picked off a pass on Southern Boone’s first play to give Eldon the ball back at the Eagle 31-yard line. Moments later, Shinn sealed the game with his third field goal on the night from 32 yards out and the Eldon defense ended the night by keeping the Eagles out of the end zone on the last play of the game. Page 2 of 2 - For Lemen, it was a nice way to finish one of his final games as a Mustang on senior night after having shoulder surgery and twisting his ankle earlier this year. “I was like, ‘I have to catch this,’” Lemen said as he saw the ball sail towards him. “It feels awesome just to help out my team and be there for these guys. I was happy for my team because it was senior night and this is probably the last time I’ll be on this field so it felt pretty awesome to seal the deal and have a good memory of this place.” Eldon picked up their fifth straight win when the final whistle blew and Jolley likes what he is seeing from his team at this point in the season. “I thought every one of our kids on the field contributed in their own way,” the coach noted. “When there were mistakes made I saw players in maroon and gold picking up their teammates. It was just a three-headed monster this Friday that worked really well for us and I could not be more proud. This is the most fun I have had all season.” Jolley also took some time to credit the coaching staff as well. “We have guys grinding on our coaching staff,” he stated. “Each of one of our coaches had a significant part in this football game in their own individual way and that was key. That was as exciting to me too for our coaching staff to see their work come to fruition.” It is not clear who Eldon (6-3) will be facing when district play begins next week, but Jolley was quick to point out that everyone has a clean slate and it is a brand new season. “The momentum has been huge for us to continue to get better,” Jolley said. “I’m proud of the way our kids rebounded, but everyone is 0-0 and we just want to be in the tournament.” By MICHAEL LOSCH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:49:24.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
