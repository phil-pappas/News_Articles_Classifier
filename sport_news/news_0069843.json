By Jane Fishman Ten to one, no candidate for office is knocking on Malcolm Chaplin’s door trying to court his vote. No one is flapping his or her jaw or running on at the mouth about crime, about jobs, about education.\nMalcolm’s just an ordinary guy. He takes the bus to work. Sometimes he walks; it clears his mind. He’s trying to save up for his upcoming wedding. He wants to do right for his future wife. He makes $10 an hour as a cook and is happy to have worked his way up to that point. He has insurance. When he goes to the dentist he likes paying $100 instead of $2,000.\nBut he’s got some views.\nFrom his modest porch at Kayton Homes, he can see the big red brick building on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, that once carried so much promise, that was going to bring a grocery store to a part of town some people call the food desert. Food Lion lasted less than a year. Closed its doors when the profit line wasn’t reached. Shut it down.\n“In my opinion, Food Lion didn’t have what the people in this neighborhood needed. No Pampers. No deli. Meat was too high.”\nNo one asked his opinion about that. Or about other things.\n“In my opinion government housing should only be a stepping stone,” he said. “You know, if you have children or you’re struggling.”\nMalcolm, who is 34, says his high school, Sol C. Johnson, did him right. He has no complaints. After graduating he got a CNA from Savannah Tech. But the work wasn’t for him. His heart wasn’t in it. Then he got a culinary certificate from Savannah Tech. That he liked. You know you did a good job when people clean their plate and they smile, he said. He worked for Vic’s on the River for a while but got laid off when business slowed down.\nThat’s the time he headed for the library at the West Broad YMCA. That’s when he saw a flyer for the Chatham Apprentice Program, an offshoot of Step Up Savannah. Something told him to apply. It changed his life, he said. He learned how to prepare a resume. He learned about going to a supervisor to resolve a conflict with a fellow employee instead of quitting. The program led him through several mock interviews.\n“That’s when I learned maybe I should have more eye contact,” he said.\nHis instructor, Isaac Felton, seemed to care about the students.\n“He’s my friend,” Malcolm said. “He went as far as he could for me.”\nMalcolm knows something about living in a part of town that doesn’t see many politicians.\n“I believe if you’re standing at the bus stop and someone robbed a liquor store and three or four police officers appear in a circle around you,\nlike they did me, more than once, like I was going to run, that’s not right,” he said. “I try to look at both views. If I’m a cop, I want to make it home to my family. But like I said to the officer, ‘Not to be disrespectful, but if I robbed a store I wouldn’t be standing at a bus stop.’”\nHe knows something about loan sharks.\n“I did that once to buy some furniture. I borrowed $100 but ended up paying $30 a month for six months. That doesn’t help your credit score. Since then I have learned from a credit counselor to pay my bills.”\nHe knows something about “ladies, weed and drinking” (which he’s replaced with “God, work and home”) and he knows folks who have prison records (he doesn’t). He understands gangs. They have problems at home, he said. The gang is like a family to them.\n“They go to prison for 10 years and get out and don’t have a family. They can’t get a job. If you’ve done your time you should be given a chance. But once you get out you have no support. Who you going to put down as references, your correction officer? Georgia Corrections? Guys go to prison for holding over an ounce. That should be a citation. But there ain’t no love in prison.\n“It’s like they don’t have them to progress. If you get the door closed behind you no matter how hard you jiggle the doorknob it won’t turn if it’s locked.”\nMalcolm — “the first on my daddy’s side to graduate high school and get a college certificate” — likes his neighborhood. It’s a safe neighborhood. You can make conversation with people. He’s familiar with his neighbors. There’s a childcare program. He lives with his mother who is diabetic so it’s hard for her to work. But when he gets married he and his bride plan to move to a two-bedroom apartment in Garden City where the rent will be $450. They’re hoping to honeymoon somewhere in the country.\n“But I know we have to be wise with our money. You eat fish and grits, not steak and potatoes. If all you can afford is a Pinto you don’t go and get a Buick.”\nI know a few politicians who could use that advice.\nJane Fishman’s columns appear weekly in Accent.
