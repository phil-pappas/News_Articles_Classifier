(Brad Horrigan) Glastonbury boys soccer puts it together in 2-0 win against Farmington \nGLASTONBURY – At Tuesday's Glastonbury boys soccer practice, coach Mark Landers saw something click with his players. \nAfter losing two of their last five games, the Tomahawks were approaching the practice with a sense of urgency and focus Landers hadn't seen this season. \n\"Once we started going back to the basics and fundamentals you could kind of see us starting to click,\" Landers said. \"Three quarters [of practice Tuesday] wasn't good, but something kicked in the last quarter of practice and I saw a change in our intensity and enthusiasm.\" \nThe Tomahawks kept clicking Thursday. \nIn a rematch of the 2014 Class LL championship, Glastonbury scored two second half goals in the final 17 minutes to beat Farmington 2-0 at Glastonbury High School in a CCC Central game. \n\"[Thursday], we brought out our defensive lunch pails with us and we did a fairly good job pressing and winning the ball back and that's what we wanted to do,\" Landers said. \nNick Kapelewski scored with 16:02 left off a free kick from Brian Carvalho to make it 1-0 and Freddy Clark gave the Tomahawks (12-2) a 2-0 lead with 8:30 left on a shot to the top corner. \n\"We were trying to see where we were at this season and we can use this [result] as a point of where we should be,\" Clark said. \"I think we got our confidence back.\" \nGlastonbury won the Class LL championship 2-1 in overtime and tied Farmington 1-1 in the regular season, but Thursday marked the first time either team has shut out the other since 2010. \nBoth defenses entered the game ready. And it showed. In the first half as neither team generated much offense as few passes got through the box and only a few shots landed on frame. \n\"We went back to the basics [Tuesday] and how to play good sound defense – one vs. one defense and how to communicate and make sure we're marked up,\" Landers said. \"I don't think that's something we've done the last two or three weeks. And we definitely got better at that [Thursday].\" \nAfter a scoreless opening 23 minutes in the second, Glastonbury got a free kick from about 23 yards out and Brian Carvalho was able to find Nick Kapelewski inside the box. Kapelewski got his right thigh on the cross and saw the ball bounce past goalie Jordan Sicklick for a 1-0 lead. \nAbout eight minutes later, Clark beat the Farmington defense and put the ball into the top corner to make it 2-0. \nFaced with a 2-0 deficit in the final eight minutes, Farmington was forced to play more direct and find Hughes on several deep passes. But it didn't work. Led by Griffin Scaglia, Alex Tow and John Kapelewski, the Glastonbury defense continued to have success limiting any quality chances from Farmington (10-2-2). \n\"The last 20 minutes we just stopped thinking individually and as a group,\" Farmington coach Steve Waters said. \"We didn't defend as a group, we didn't move the ball as a group and we got tired. They're a lot bigger, faster and deeper than we are so we have to play smarter and we certainly didn't play smarter in the last 20 minutes.\" \nWindham Tech 5, Parish Hill 0: Mario Rangel scored four goals and coach Charles Rayner got his 300 t h win as Windham Tech (10-3) beat Parish Hill in Chaplin. \nRayner is 300-249-53 in 39 seasons coaching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:13:11.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
