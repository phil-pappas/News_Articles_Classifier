(Photo: Bob Goshert / for The Star) \nBy the end of next year, NASCAR will have said goodbye to arguably two of its three biggest stars in a span of two seasons. \nThis generation's star power drain has begun. It started with Jeff Gordon , who is wrapping up his final season . Now, with Tony Stewart expected to announce his retirement from stock car racing Wednesday — effective after 2016 — it's realistic to think more will follow him out the door. \nNo one can race forever, but many fans hoped Mark Martin 's example — racing and being competitive until his early 50s — would be the model their favorite drivers followed for years to come. \nAs it turns out, Martin was probably the exception. Gordon is out at 44 years old, and Stewart will be 45 when he retires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:07:26.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
