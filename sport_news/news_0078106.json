They don’t deserve to be on the Tybee Council.”\n“You think your neighbor’s barking dogs are bad? My neighbor put a rooster right under my bedroom window, as far from his window as possible. And he got mad when we complained, saying he couldn’t hear it!”\n“To protect our city, forget the local police. They have failed. It is time to call up the Army Rangers and military snipers to protect our city. After 9/11, military police patrolled on Hunter and Stewart. I didn’t fear for my life while walking there. I felt safe!”\n“Whatever happened to the Guardian Angels that patrolled the downtown streets?”\n“Excellent article about hiring new police and patrolling high-crime areas. But aren’t the rest of us worthy of increased police presence?”\n“Thank you to whoever picked up the litter on Ferguson Avenue. It’s never looked so clean!”\n“The mowing on I-16 coming into Savannah looks very nice. Thank you!”\nContribute to Vox Populi by calling 912-525-0VOX (0869) or emailing us at vox@savannahnow.com .
