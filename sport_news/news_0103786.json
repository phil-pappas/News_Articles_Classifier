Back | Next MIKE GUNNOE/SPECIAL TO THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL Kansas forward Cheick Diallo shares a laugh during an interview at the Kansas men's basketball media day Thursday at Allen Fieldhouse. Diallo said he worked on his shooting during the summer. \nLAWRENCE — Though Cheick Diallo can speak four languages, he’s been most concerned with English lately. \nEspecially when it comes to people talking about his basketball skill set. \n“A lot of people say, ‘Cheick cannot shoot. Blah, blah, blah,’ ” the Kansas forward said with a smile during Thursday’s KU basketball media day. “So I’ve got to prove to people that I can shoot.” \nThe 6-foot-9 freshman went to work on that this summer. \nFor most days — including every day in July — Diallo went to KU’s practice gym to fire up 700 15-foot jumpshots. Most days he’d make between 75 and 80 percent of his attempts, taking a photo of the final tally before sending it to coach Bill Self. \n“He said that’s good. That’s progress,” Diallo said. “That’s what he told me every time. Keep working.” \nDiallo claims he'll continue to do that as he waits on the NCAA to rule on his eligibility for this season. \nSelf said Thursday that Diallo was allowed to practice with the team and take part in next week’s Late Night in the Phog. Still, Diallo’s playing status remains in limbo as the NCAA investigates the coursework Diallo took at Our Savior New American in Centereach, N.Y. \nSelf said KU was still in the process of gathering and sending documents to the NCAA Eligibility Center on Diallo’s behalf. \n“Can't really give a decision if you don't have the information in front of you,” Self said. “We hope (a decision) is sooner rather than later. I've said that all along. But I don't know that there's any indication that there will be an exact timeline other than the fact I'm sure it will be done before the season starts.” \nDiallo was asked if the uncertainty heading into the season was frustrating. \n“Of course, yeah, but I cannot do anything about it. I’ve just got to let it go,” Diallo said. “I’m going to just keep doing what I’m supposed to do.” \nIf Diallo is cleared, Self is expecting an immediate impact player. \nThe coach has been most impressed by the freshman’s athleticism, saying he is a quick-twitch player with infectious energy. Self also said Diallo’s 7-foot-5 wingspan should serve him well when it comes to blocks and rebounding. \nBasketball wasn’t originally Diallo’s first choice. In 2010, the forward switched to basketball after his father, Mamadou, told him he was getting too tall to play soccer. He nearly quit the sport two weeks in because he felt like he wasn’t getting better. \n“I just talked to myself,” Diallo said. “One day, I was like, ‘I need to do it. I need to play basketball. Just take it serious with my dad.’ ” \nIt all led to Diallo eventually earning Rivals’ No. 5 ranking in the 2015 class before he committed to KU in April. \nThe freshman wasn’t afraid to show his personality in his first meeting with reporters Monday. He spoke a few words in his native language when asked to do so, talked about how he likes to dunk on people and didn’t back down when asked if he believed he was the top player in the 2015 class. \n“I feel like if people are asking me … yes, I am,” Diallo said. “I like to compare. I like to say that I am the best.” \nHe also likes to read what’s written about him while working to prove his jumper might be better than people think. \n“If (a defender) doesn’t come to me, a second or so, I’m going to shoot in your face so easy,” Diallo said with a laugh. “That’s so simple. That’s why I was like, ‘I’ve got to keep shooting.’ ” \nHIGH PRAISE — Self gushed about freshman forward Carlton Bragg, who was a McDonald’s All-American last year along with Diallo. \n“Carlton is one of the most talented big guys we've had since I've been here,” Self said. “Offensively, obviously, a Marcus Morris-type guy. He's one of those guys that has that type of skill, and it's going to take time, but certainly I think he has a chance to be a special guy.” \nTALENTED TEAM — Self believed this year’s roster was deeper than most, saying he had “12 pretty good guys, and 12 is not going to play.” \nTypically, Self whittles his rotation down to eight or nine by the conference season. \n“It's going to be hard this year,” Self said, “figuring out who to play.” \nMOVIN’ IN — Self reported that KU’s players were scheduled to move into newly constructed McCarthy Hall sometime next week. \nKU started work on the apartments in September of last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:42:54.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
