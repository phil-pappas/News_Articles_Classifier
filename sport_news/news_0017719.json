A win could quiet those running with the narrative that third-year coach Bret Bielema hasn't backed up his bluster at Arkansas.\nFor No. 14 Texas A&M, a victory could add heft to its undefeated start, which began with a victory over then-ranked Arizona State on Sept. 5.\nThe Aggies will also be using last season's meeting at JerryWorld for context. They escaped with a 35-28 overtime victory, A&M's third win in a row over Arkansas and also a turning point.\nIt \"took a lot out of our football team,\" A&M coach Kevin Sumlin said this week. He's said that getting beat up by the Hogs contributing to a three-game losing streak that followed after the Aggies left Arlington 5-0.\nLest one forget: 48-31 at Mississippi State, 35-20 to Ole Miss, 59-0 at Alabama.\n\"We were 5-0 and we fell off really bad,\" A&M center Mike Matthews said. \"We're not going to let that happen this year.\"\nSaturday's meeting will be an early way to gauge if the steps the Aggies have taken to be more physical, add depth and take better care of their bodies is paying off.\n\"We've changed some things,\" Sumlin said. \"Right or wrong, what you have to do is look at where you are and be honest. ...We have to help and give our guys a chance. I think we've gone and done that. We'll see how the results go.\"\nSumlin says it over and over: The SEC is a line-of-scrimmage and depth league.\nA&M brought in run game coordinator/offensive line coach Dave Christensen in the offseason to help schematically up front. The results are still out, but the Aggies have backed up their talk of running the ball through three games, with 134 carries to 100 passing attempts.\nOn the defensive line, the improved depth has been notable.\n\"We could play 10, 12 guys out there,\" said senior tackle Julien Obioha, who made a tackle for no gain on Arkansas running back Alex Collins on fourth-and-1 in overtime last season. \"It produces competition, which brings the best out of you. That's why the defensive line has been producing so much.\"\nA&M leads the Football Bowl Subdivision in sacks and tackles for loss, and it will get its biggest challenge yet Saturday. Arkansas' 1,600-pound line has yet to give up a sack.\nThe Hogs' big bodies last season left Obioha aching.\n\"The next morning, I woke up feeling like I was hit by a truck,\" Obioha said.\nHe wasn't the only one. A&M has researched how best to get its players through a physically grinding season. One answer: yoga.\n\"At first it was a little awkward,\" said receiver Jeremy Tabuyo, \"a little funny, football players doing yoga. But people got used to it. It calms you down and relaxes your body.\"\nA&M players gather in groups of 15 or 20 in the weight room and are led by a yoga instructor on Sundays, Tabuyo said, which A&M calls recovery day and also includes massages.\n\"There are a lot of hard poses,\" Tabuyo said of yoga. \"I'm not going to lie.\"\nThe Aggies have also switched how they practice. They used to taper, Matthews said, starting off the week with tough practices that lessened as the week went on.\nNow they'll hold a \"No Sweat\" light practice on Thursday and a \"Full Speed\" practice on Friday that leads into game day.\n\"I specifically feel the results,\" Matthews said. \"I'm really glad we made the changes.\"\nAs for Arkansas, it will try to inspire its own change in its season's trajectory. The Razorbacks, who entered the season ranked amid buzz they could be dark horses in the SEC West, haven't scored a touchdown in the second half the last two weeks.\n\"I think just a break here or there,\" Bielema said. \"We're trying to get a ball to bounce a right way, a call that will go our way. ... Take every game for what it is. The good news is none of these games carry into SEC play now.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:59:31.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
