Utley was on the bench and didn't play in the Dodgers' 13-7 loss Monday night.\nUtley will be eligible to play for the rest of the best-of-five NL Division Series against the Mets, who led 2-1 going into Game 4 Tuesday night.\nLos Angeles Dodgers' Chase Utley throws the ball during batting practice before Game 3 of baseball?s National League Division Series against the New York Mets, Monday, Oct. 12, 2015, at CitiField in New York.
