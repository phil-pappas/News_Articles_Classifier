The Wildcats carved up the Beavers, putting together long scoring drives combined with lightning-quick strikes with big plays. The result was 644 total yards, 368 coming on the ground, and a 44-7 thrashing. The big problem was players getting caught out of position. Not acceptable, as far as Andersen and Sitake were concerned. \"I don't know what else could be more of a teaching moment than seeing what we've done in the games that we've lost, how poorly we played technique-wise and even fundamentals,\" Sitake, OSU's defensive coordinator, said. \"More than anything, guys not being in the right spots and we've got to fix that.\" Said Andersen: \"I think they're playing with effort, but they don't as a whole group completely understand the responsibility factor of playing big-time college football on the defensive side of the ball.\" Andersen was particularly disappointed with the play of the linebackers. He said defensive end Jaswha James played at a championship level at Arizona, but was often put in tough situations because of mistakes by his teammates. \"I was extremely disappointed in the play of the linebackers and it's nothing they haven't been told and that we understand,\" Andersen said. \"It's hard to swallow sometimes when the kid that played at a championship level gets double teamed off the line of scrimmage on the big run when we're backed up because we don't line up in the right spots as linebackers.\" Sitake already has tried to make the scheme a bit easier for the players by going with a simpler approach than what he might use with a more experienced team. He found that most of the problems stem from players not being prepared and failing to execute in games. \"Scheme-wise we can't go any simpler than what we're doing as a defense, otherwise we're sacrificing a lot of what we can do to help us be successful as a team,\" Sitake said. \"We can't dummy it down any more, we can't get any more simple.\" The answer, according to both coaches, could come down to adjusting their decisions on who does or doesn't get on the field. \"We have the ability to put 70 kids on an airplane (and) we put 67 on an airplane. So if next week we have 70, we'll put 70. If we have 65 that I believe and trust and can compete and play at a high level, then we'll put them on that airplane,\" Andersen said. \"We won't compromise in what we do, what we believe and what we feel. We'll put the best kids out there and let them fight and battle for the spots. That's where we are on defense.\" The coaching staff has put part of the responsibility of helping the younger players to raise their game on the shoulders of the seniors. That means players such as cornerback Larry Scott, defensive end Jaswha James and defensive linemen Kyle Peko need to step up as leaders as well as stay strong on the field. Peko said the seniors have taken up the challenge. \"I think a lot of the older guys are now pressing the point to everybody and trying to take leadership and ownership for this team and getting everybody going the right way,\" Peko said. The Beavers (2-3, 0-2) will get another big test this weekend at Washington State. The Cougars (3-2, 1-1) are coming off an upset win at Oregon, average 478.4 yards a game and lead the Pac-12 in passing yards per game with 396.4. Quarterback Luke Falk leads the conference in passing with 392.8 yards a game with 15 touchdowns and two interceptions. \"The guy's pretty confident in his O-line,\" Peko said. \"He stays in the pocket, he doesn't like scrambling. So hopefully that's a positive for us and we're able to get after it. The O-line, after watching film, is good. Wide splits, though. So I think that will help us get into the backfield.\" The Beavers have struggled to get to the quarterback this season. They have six sacks with four players with one each. \"It's a little tougher to get a pass rush with a three-man front,\" Peko said. \"But I think that this week the scheme's a little different, running the four-man front a little bit more and helping us be able to get back there, so we'll see how it goes.\" By Kevin Hampton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:18:46.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
