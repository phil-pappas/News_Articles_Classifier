Flu season carries an actual price tag for the nation but the impact on your bottom line can be curbed with some simple steps.\nIn addition to the sneezing, the coughing, the aches and the misery, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the flu carries an economic toll for the nation every year.\nThat includes $10.4 billion in direct medical expenses, and $16.3 billion in lost earnings for sick employees.\nThe flu can be particularly costly for households with young children, who are most likely to become infected with the flu virus, the CDC says.\nThey found that caregivers of children sick with the flu took on medical expenses between $300 and $4,000, depending upon the severity of the illness.\nFor kids and adults, fighting fall and winter colds and flu can be made easier by putting certain items in the grocery cart.\nYogurt's live cultures can help prevent colds.\nMushrooms show promise in boosting immunity.\nWater and other fluids can help clean a cold out of your system.\nHot peppers and spices can help clear sinuses and honey can soothe an irritated throat.\nFlu season typically peaks between January and March, but the CDC warns the flu is unpredictable, and timing varies every year. That's why they recommend getting a vaccine now, in the fall.\nCopyright 2015 CNN.
