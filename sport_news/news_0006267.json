Staff photo by Katherine Frye slideshow With region cross country meets on tap for this week, this is usually when the season either starts or ends for teams.The Marietta boys are still looking to defend their Class state championship, but first, they have business to take care of business in the Region 4 meet Wednesday at Allatoona Creek Park.The top four teams in each region will qualify for the Nov. 6 state meet in Carrollton, as will the top runner on a team that does not advance, as long as he or she finishes in the top six.Marietta, led by the core of Carlos Torres, Hayden Tullos, David Savic and KhayVonn Benson, has experience and is the clear favorite to win Wednesday. At the county meet on the same course earlier this month, the Blue Devils beat the next-best team by 42 points. Marietta’s success will be dependent on how well it starts out of the gate. The Blue Devils got away with starting too fast at the county meet. Since then, the runners worked on improving their starts, and it showed when they won the Coach Wood Invitational in Gainesville a week ago. “We raced Coach Wood and were patient out of the gate, and we looked really good coming in,” Marietta coach Jack Coleman said. “Everybody is healthy and right where we want to be this time of year.”Harrison has the same agenda for the girls meet. Kira Stanley, Kayli Moody and Bailey Peak continue to lead the Lady Hoyas, and last year’s top runner, Mattie Rountree, is healthy following a bout with pneumonia, Harrison co-coach Kent Simmons said. “We’re favored, but we also know that North Paulding and Marietta will be coming after us pretty hard,” Simmons said. “We’re hoping to do well and get our kids qualified for state.”The Allatoona girls will attempt to defend their Region 5 title Thursday at Clinton Farms in Villa Rica, but the Lady Buccaneers may have a tough time after graduating six runners, including the top four finishers. The boys will have a shot at besting their runner-up showing of last year behind top runner Colton Page, who will be shooting for his second straight individual title.The Walton boys have enough top-tier talent to have a strong showing in the Region 5 meet Saturday at Boling Park in Canton. Andrew Singh and Ben Dahlgren are expected to run after they finished in the top 10 last year, but the Raiders may have a difficult time beating Milton after finishing second to the Eagles last season.“Hopefully, we’ll have our best group running on Saturday,” Walton coach Travis Gower said. “Milton is definitely a favorite. I don’t think anyone in the region has beaten them this year. It should be interesting to see which teams make it and which teams are done (Saturday).”The Walton girls, who were third in the region last season, are a younger team without Avery Bussjager, who’s since moved on to Kentucky, but the Lady Raiders in contention for the top four. Milton is also the defending champion of the girls meet. Both Whitefield Academy teams will attempt to defend their titles in the Area 4A meet. Although the boys team graduated current Virginia runner Robby Keough, it returned most of its unit, led by seniors Kerry Martin and Kalen Tavassoli. The girls also lost a couple of key runners, but it did return Kate Taylor. The Region 7 meet, with Kell and Sprayberry, will be Wednesday at Boling Park, while South Cobb, Pebblebrook and Campbell will head to Newnan on Saturday for the Region 3 meet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:05:42.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
