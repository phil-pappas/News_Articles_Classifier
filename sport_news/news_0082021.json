The “Late Show” host – who graduated from Northwestern and performed at Second City – went off on billy goats Thursday while celebrating the Cubs’ wild-card game victory.\n“So many things I’ve been wanting to say about your kind for years, but I’ve been too scared of because of the curse,” Colbert said. “Not anymore. First off, your cheese sucks, OK? You can get the same flavor by leaving a brick of Philadelphia Cream Cheese to dry out.\n\"Secondly, nice beard. Soul patches went out in the '70s. What are you going to do about it, goats? Curse the Cubs again? I dare you. The Cubs are unstoppable.”\nNoticing that the real life goat in the crowd wasn’t cheering with the rest of the audience, Colbert had it kicked out in a nod to the infamous “Curse of the Billy Goat.” (According to legend, Billy Goat Tavern owner Billy Sianis “cursed” the team after he and his pet goat were kicked out of a Cubs-Detroit Tigers World Series game at Wrigley Field in 1945.)\nColbert dared the Curse Gods even further by guaranteeing the Cubs would win the World Series and showing off the Cubs World Series Champions T-shirt he had made.\nThe South Carolina-raised Colbert referred to the Cubs as “my Cubs” during the rant and explained that his excitement for the team was a result of his Chicago-area ties.\n“I love New York, but I lived in Chicago for 11 years and the Windy City will always be a part of me,” Colbert said.” Specially my lower intestine that is still packed with a fair amount of sausage.”\nlgomez@tribpub.com\nTwitter @TribLuis\nFacebook @TribLuis\nInstagram @TribLuis\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617b044/turbine/ct-stephen-colbert-cubs-billy-goat-curse-20151009", "https://twitter.com/tribluis", "https://instagram.com/tribluis/", "https://www.facebook.com/TribLuis/"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:02:58.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
