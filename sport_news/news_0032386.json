They post win totals in the 30s and fade away come April, neither terribly relevant to the playoff proceedings nor the lottery draw. This is the NBA’s middle class, and at this stage in the preseason, it appears to have grown so full it may burst.\nThe reconstructive cycles of teams around the league seem to have synced. Philadelphia aside, most every NBA franchise has designs on being competitive. Some arrived at that conclusion organically through patient rebuilds that have paid off. Other teams will fight due largely to a lack of alternatives; draft pick debts—some accrued from deals made nearly a half-decade ago—have removed the incentive to play things slow. Three teams finished the 2014–15 season with fewer than 20 wins. It’s possible that none will do so this season, broadening the ranks of the competent.\nRaising the floor, however, also changes the parameters of what could be considered tanking. The Sixers are a world apart in the brazenness and resolve of their current plan. Yet the fact that even an unabashed tank mission like theirs can be expected to return 20 wins or more brings so many other teams within range of prime draft position. We saw last season that pursuit of a playoff spot or a top-10 pick were not mutually exclusive for Eastern Conference teams. Miami finished one game behind eighth-seeded Boston and still able to land Justise Winslow with the No. 10 pick .\n• MORE NBA: 14 NBA players in contract years looking to cash in\nThe West isn’t quite so accommodating, but even the worst teams in the conference lack the disaster potential of a traditional skunk. Portland is set for a hard fall after rebooting its roster but looks athletic and feisty enough to win its share. Denver and Sacramento won around 30 games last season while in complete disorder and have aimed to address those problems since. The Lakers will bear little resemblance to the team that won 21 games last season, even if they’re by no means comparable to a playoff squad, either. Even Minnesota—winners of just 16 games last year—has much rosier prospects after returning key players from injury and adding to its trove of young talent.\nNBA Roundtable: Who will be the NBA's flop team this season? by SI Staff", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/RobMahoney"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:07:37.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
