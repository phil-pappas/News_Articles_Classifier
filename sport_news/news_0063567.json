The school chose Wildcats instead. \nIn 2008, I submitted the name Fighting Catfish when Arkansas State, my alma mater, decided to drop Indians as its mascot. The school decided on Red Wolves instead and in the process completely ignored the fact catfish outnumber red wolves about 1 million to none in the delta region of east Arkansas. \nI whiffed again about the same time period when I suggested the mascot for the Northwest Arkansas Naturals baseball team be called Satch, for Sasquatch, or Nat, for Naturals. Instead, they chose Strike, which is a lame name for a hairy creature who stands 6-foot-9. \nGoing 0 for 3 in the Name Game won't stop me. I've got one more plate appearance and I'm using it today to help select the new mascot at Fort Smith Southside, where the Rebels nickname is being dropped. \nA mascot selection committee, consisting of 29 people, met in Fort Smith last week to whittle a large list of suggestions down to five. First, be aware of some names that, thankfully, didn't make the cut: Bandits, Blazers, Border Devils, Crushers, Guardians, Jedi Knights, Rockets, Shockers, and Thunder. \nWhen asked to pick a top five, committee members selected Mavericks as the front-runner with 29 votes, followed by Patriots, 26 votes, Spartans, 17 votes, and Mustangs and Marshals with 11 votes apiece. \nI could accept Mavericks or Mavs, but only if Dallas Mavericks basketball star Dirk Nowitzki were available in the off-season to play tight end and first base for Southside. Mustangs is OK, but Patriots and Spartans are unacceptable. \nIf I had a vote, which I don't, Marshals would be the easy choice to replace Rebels as the Southside mascot. Fort Smith has a rich western history of lawmen and outlaws and the nickname ties in perfectly with the U.S. Marshals Museum that will be built along the banks of the Arkansas River, not far from the badlands of Oklahoma. \nSouthside could keep its red, white, and blue colors and a five-pointed star, like the design for the planned museum, would replace Rebs on the team's helmet. A Southside student could lead the cheering section dressed as Bass Reeves, a former slave, who served with distinction for 32 years as a deputy U.S. Marshal under Isaac C. Parker, the famous \"hanging judge.\" \nNot convinced? Then how about an endorsement from someone who truly knows history, Jim Dunn, who is the president and CEO of the U.S. Marshals Museum in Fort Smith? \n\"We like the idea,\" said Dunn, when asked about Marshals as the replacement mascot for Southside. \"The name is part of Fort Smith's heritage. The Marshals spread the law to the west and displayed unbelievable courage and overcame great odds in bringing bad men in to face justice.\" \nCourage. Integrity. Service. What high school sports team wouldn't want to be associated with such admirable traits? \nDunn did emphasize the final decision on the mascot should be made by the school board and students at Southside. Fair enough. \nAdmittedly, my success rate in picking mascots and nicknames for sports team in Arkansas is not good. But I am confident that when all the names are scrutinized, Marshals will emerge as the new mascot at Southside High School. \nI am absolutely sure of it. Just like I was sure the Razorbacks would win nine games in football this season. \nSports on 10/11/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:00:44.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
