Tom Brady, as always, was the offensive operator, but the 28-year-old receiver surfaced in clutch moments to move the chains.\nOn a 3rd-and-7 in the second quarter, Amendola got eight yards, and the Patriots charged forward for their first touchdown of the game. On a 3rd-and-6 in the fourth quarter, the veteran wideout nabbed an eight-yard reception for a go-ahead touchdown. Later in the fourth quarter, Amendola had an 11-yard catch on a 3rd-and-10, and Rob Gronkowski scored a touchdown on the next play.\n If Brady was going to will the Patriots to victory, he needed players to stop dropping catches (the Patriots had 11 drops on the day). Amendola and Gronk’s sure-handed performances made the difference for the Pats.\n1. Tom Brady — Brady had a rough first half, missing receivers, and struggling with accuracy. On his two fourth-quarter touchdown drives, however, he was on-point. He finished 34 of 54 with 355 yards and two touchdowns, on a day where he was also the leading rusher with 15 yards.\n2. Danny Amendola — He carried a group of drop-prone receivers with eight catches for 86 yards and a touchdown. Plus, he was like a gymnast out there .\n3. Dont’a Hightower — Hightower finished the game with 10 tackles, eight pressures, two quarterback hits, and six hurries. He was instrumental in holding Chris Ivory to 41 yards on 17 attempts.\n4. Rob Gronkowski — Gronk powered his way through the Jets defense with 11 receptions for 108 yards and touchdown. He got it done when he was wide open , but more importantly, with players dangling from his legs.\nGronk run. Gronk catch. Gronk take Jets defender for a ride. #NYJvsNE https://t.co/nh4fSqudtI\n— NFL (@NFL) October 25, 2015 5. Logan Ryan — With help from safety Devin McCourty, the third-year cornerback spent the day covering Brandon Marshall, and left the Jets’ wide receiver frustrated.\nMy A** should be walking back to New York. How you bounce back after moments like this produce CHAMPIONS or CHUMPS.. . #jets\n— Machine Marshall (@BMarshall) October 25, 2015 6. Josh McDaniels — With the injuries to key players like Dion Lewis and Marcus Cannon, the Patriots were installing plays three hours before kickoff, Brady told reporters Sunday . Credit McDaniels, in part, for the Patriots’ 30 points against an outstanding Jets defense.\n7. David Andrews — On an offensive line riddled with injuries and inconsistency, the rookie undrafted center has played every snap this season, allowing one sack, three QB hits, and two hurries.\nPlaying all 67 offensive snaps, rookie center David Andrews continued his streak as only Patriots player to play every snap this season.\n— Mike Reiss (@MikeReiss) October 26, 2015 8. Jamie Collins — The linebacker finished with 12 tackles, a pass deflection, and a drive-ending sack. He didn’t defy gravity , but he continued to show why he’s one of the most complete triple-threat linebackers in the league in run defense, coverage, and as a pass-rusher.\n9. Julian Edelman — He may have dropped a wide-open touchdown (while Darrelle Revis was in coverage), but he had an important third-and-17 catch, which led to the Amendola touchdown. Plus, he got up after this hit.\n10. Brandon LaFell’s hands — It’s funny now, right ?\nFantastic images from Jets vs. Patriots\nPrevious -- of -- Next The Patriots take on the Jets, in photos.
