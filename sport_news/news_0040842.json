Besides, permission is also required from a veterinary doctor,\" Association's President Daljit Singh said.\n\"The whole process takes about two months...which is sheer harassment,\" he said adding \"due to such conditions, our cow breeding business which is worth Rs 2,500 crore has been adversely hit.\"\n\"Against the potential of sending 800 cows daily from Punjab to other states, we are given permission for about 20 cows per month,\" he said.\nA cross-bred cow fetches Rs 1.25 to Rs 1.50 lakh.\n\"Because of delay in permission, buyers from other states are not ready to come here. Where will these three lakh cows go?\" he asked.\nSingh also claimed that some self-styled cow protection groups operating in the state also harass and even attack trucks carrying cows.\nMeanwhile, Punjab Gau Sewa Commission Chairman Keemti Bhagat said, \"We don't object to transportation of milking cows. But we will never allow cows to be sent out for slaughter under the garb of trade.\"\nBhagat said that in last two years, 430 FIRs have been registered in the state in connection with incidents of cow slaughter or smuggling of bovines.
