He walked one and struck out eight, the only run he allowed was another solo home run to Daniel Murphy.\nHe threw hard, crisp and mostly excellent location. He looked like one very determined pitcher. The Mets never seemed to have a chance.\nEven when the seventh inning -- where he’d melted down in his last three postseason starts -- started ominously with a swinging-bunt single by Yoenis Cespedes that slipped under Kershaw's glove, he simply bore down and retired the next three Mets.\nAll without incident or fresh nightmare.\nManager Don Mattingly elected to remove Kershaw after the seventh, setting himself up for second-guessers since Kershaw had thrown only 93 pitches.\nAnd things got real interesting in the eighth. Chris Hatcher took over and got the first two Mets, but then walked Curtis Granderson. Mattingly immediately called on closer Kenley Jansen to face David Wright.\nJansen, who'd thrown once in the last 10 days, walked Wright -- after a disputed check swing that would have been strike three -- and everyone at Citi Field was on their feet as Murphy came to the plate. Jansen's fastball hit 97 mph, his highest all season.\nMurphy worked the count full before flying out to center, but the inning cost Jansen 14 pitches. In the ninth, however, he retired the Mets in order. It was only his second four-out save of the year.\nThe Dodgers scored all three of their runs against rookie left-hander Steven Matz in the third inning. Kershaw actually collected the game’s first hit, but was erased at second on an Enrique Hernandez groundout.\nBut then game three consecutive hits. Howie Kendrick singled and Adrian Gonzalez followed with an RBI basehit. Justin Turner, the ex-Met who’s been on fire the entire series, doubled into the left-field corner to score two.\nInning by inning: Dodgers beat Mets, 3-1, to force Game 5 of NLDS Steve Dilbeck Final: Dodgers 3, Mets 1\nThe series is headed to Los Angeles for a decisive Game 5.
