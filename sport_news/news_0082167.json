ReverendBlue October 19, 2015 at 11:47 am | Permalink | Reply \nYes, I also noticed that his “technique” was mostly to stand straight up and catch the offensive lineman. As a 1 technique, he could be so valuable to us if he would fire out of his stance and use his size to blow the center back a yard or two and disrupt the pulling offensive linemen and back angles. I think he could do it if he puts his mind to it. KT October 19, 2015 at 11:49 am | Permalink \n^^this. BenHur October 19, 2015 at 12:01 pm | Permalink \nHis four point stance is really just fingers touching the ground and all the weight in his heels. I don’t know football as well as players or coaches, but it seems to me you can’t possibly explode out of that position. Takes him 2 seconds after the snap to get weight going forward.

Rectumuz prime October 19, 2015 at 12:02 pm | Permalink | Reply \nHow bout we use Conrad some more in the passing game, ya know since he catches it? no? alright. go cats BenHur October 19, 2015 at 12:11 pm | Permalink \nMr. Rectum, I agree, Conrad deserves 4-5 targets a game. J-Dub421 October 19, 2015 at 12:29 pm | Permalink \nConrad will be able to get more targets as a passer when Boom learns to block better in the backfield. Until then Conrad is needed as a blocker. inside info2 October 19, 2015 at 1:41 pm | Permalink \nWhat J-Dub said. Conrad is more important to us as a blocker than as a receiver right now. It sucks for him, but I hope he understands why he isn’t targeted as much as he should be. BenHur October 19, 2015 at 2:00 pm | Permalink \nBeing needed for blocking doesn’t mean he has to block every single down. BAdams October 19, 2015 at 12:16 pm | Permalink | Reply \nIf Matt hasnt gotten it by now, I wonder if he ever will. Not since Faulkner have I seen a top rated recruit be so non-existant, and a lot of that is thanks to Joker (talking about Faulkner). If he cant get his weight moving forward and play with some effort, he just needs to sit on the bench. I hope he turns it around though. As for the Foster…am I crazy or was he better last year? I dont get what is up with our special teams (I know MacGinnis has been injured) but special teams was usually a strong point for us, even under Joker. And as much as I hate to see Melvin Lewis get hurt like that, and I’m sure I will catch hell for saying this, but that looked like some nasty instant karma. He gets a personal foul call (from the replay I couldnt see what the offensive lineman did but all I saw was Melvin pushing him to the ground) then the next play he is injured. I feel bad for the guy though, it looked and sounded pretty painful. Hopefully he recovers soon. jcatron October 19, 2015 at 1:19 pm | Permalink \nBring back backwards hat guy! kyle heavy October 19, 2015 at 1:08 pm | Permalink | Reply \nIs it me or did Cody Quinn get abused against Auburn? Fred Tiller hasn’t played all year but his equally terrible running mate from last year is still starting. jcatron October 19, 2015 at 1:18 pm | Permalink \nI agree with Quinn but I think JD big play Harmon needs in there more instead of Tiller. kyle heavy October 19, 2015 at 1:25 pm | Permalink \nOh I agree with starting Harmon. I’m not advocating for Tiller to play more. I’m advocating for Quinn to join him on the bench. fatbrat October 19, 2015 at 5:34 pm | Permalink \nAre you serious Cody Quinn is still starting? #5 was killing him before he got his eye poked. I believe he was the cover guy on the blown coverage in the end zone. On the first play of the second half he got ‘Rudied’…. like Rudy got in practice, just got blown up. I think he sat most of the 2nd half. Football 101? October 19, 2015 at 1:26 pm | Permalink | Reply \nFor those that want the aggressive d-linemen to distrupt the LOS, remember what the 3-4/hybrid defense is supposed to be. Gap responsibilities by the D-line w/ the LBs free to make the play. Generally, the responsibility of the nose guard (Elam/Lewis) is to clog up as much of the middle of the offensive line as possible to allow the other defensive players to make plays, hence the pillow fighting we see at times. However, I think, while that is the purpose, they should still initiate an aggressive point of attack while holding the gap, unlike what we have seen with Elam who lets the contact come to him and can often get moved out of gap responsibility due to poor technique and height. Need to be more physical. inside info2 October 19, 2015 at 1:44 pm | Permalink \nFrom what people around the program are saying, it’s Elam’s attitude that is holding him back more than anything. That needs to get straightened out first.
