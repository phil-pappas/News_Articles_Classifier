This was Deepika's fourth World Cup Final silver after being runner-up at Istanbul 2011, Tokyo 2012 and Paris 2013, an unparalleled achievement in consistency on the circuit.\n\"My arrows went up. I tried to fix my sight but nothing worked,\" explained Deepika. Making a comeback after one-year, sixth seeded Deepika defeated Korean third seed Kawanaka Kaori 6-4 in the quarters to open her campaign in the showpiece event.\nIn the semis, she won by an identical margin against Le Chien-Ying who settled for a bronze after beating Mackenzie Brown in the third place playoff.\nEarlier Saturday, Verma had bagged India a first ever 'Archery World Cup Final' medal in the compound section after being pipped by Turkey's Demir Elmaagcli.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:52:15.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
