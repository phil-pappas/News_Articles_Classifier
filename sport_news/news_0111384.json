But it was certainly the most impactful. \n[ Best and worst from moments from the Redskins’ comeback win ] \nIn a game strewn with highlights and lowlights, Breeland streaked across the field to prevent a touchdown that would have turned Tampa Bay’s three-point lead into a 10-point lead with four minutes remaining. \nTaking a perfect angle and closing fast, Breeland pushed Doug Martin out of bounds at Washington’s 5-yard line after the 224-pound running back had blown past a line of defenders late in the game.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press) \nBreeland injured a hamstring on the play and was unable to continue, relegated to the sideline to watch as the Redskins defense held firm on the goal-line stand, allowing Tampa Bay only a field goal and giving the offense a chance to win the game on a two-minute drive, trailing by six. \nIn the locker room after the Redskins pulled off the biggest comeback in team history, overcoming a 24-point deficit to defeat Tampa Bay, 31-30, Breeland spoke about the play and the injury that resulted. \n[ Jay Gruden: ‘The players were up to the challenge’ ] \n“We were in a blitz and I had the receiver, so I had to come over to the other side,” Breeland said. “I just saw [Martin] cut back on the back side, and he just took off. I was just wanting to get him down.” \nBreeland said he didn’t feel the damage to his hamstring until after the play. \n“I don’t know whether I pulled it during the run or making the tackle,” said Breeland, explaining that he wasn’t sure of the severity of the injury because he hadn’t seen a doctor. “My focus was just make the tackle.” \nRedskins Coach Jay Gruden called it the play of the day. \n“They score there, the game’s over,” Gruden said. “That shows what kind of guy he is. I talk about Breeland being an ultimate competitor. If he takes that one play off, or one instance and they go up by 10, the game’s over most likely. And he hustled, got them down at the five. We got a big stop, held a field goal, we go down and score.” Liz Clarke currently covers the Washington Redskins for The Washington Post.
