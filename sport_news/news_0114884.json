Barrett at QB, and he'll be the starter over Cardale Jones on Saturday at Rutgers. (Getty Images) \nCardale Jones has never lost a game as the starting quarterback at Ohio State, but Urban Meyer announced on Tuesday that he was making the switch to J.T. Barrett. And it's the right move. \nThe Buckeyes are still ranked No. 1 with a 7-0 record, but it's clear that the offense has operated with better efficiency when Barrett is under center. Barrett, who Ohio State began to use as a red-zone quarterback over the last few weeks, ended up playing much of last Saturday night's game against Penn State. His running ability helped lead the Buckeyes to a 38-10 win after a slow start with Jones behind center. \n\"J.T has earned the right to start Saturday at Rutgers,\" Meyer told reporters on Tuesday . \nBarrett, a sophomore, started 12 games last year after Braxton Miller re-injured his shoulder. He proceeded to finish second nationally in passer rating and fifth in the Heisman Trophy vote, and he would have rushed for over 1,000 yards had he not broken his leg against Michigan. Jones replaced him for the Big Ten title game and the College Football Playoff, dazzling with his strong arm and powerful running as he helped lead the Buckeyes to the national title. \nJones was the starting quarterback through the spring with Barrett and Miller still recovering from injuries, and as Miller shifted to receiver, Jones kept the job into the season. As Meyer repeatedly said, Barrett had to beat Jones out, and he didn't quite do it up until now. \nThe departure of top deep threat Devin Smith has hurt Jones, and Ohio State has struggled to find an identity on offense after losing coordinator Tom Herman. Meyer's offenses have typically leaned heavily on the read-option, but Meyer shifted his philosophy around Jones, whose deep passing can open up space for tailback Ezekiel Elliott and the Buckeyes' other talented athletes. Jones ranks 48 th nationally in passer rating, completing 62.4 percent for 1,242 yards (8.3 per attempt) with seven touchdowns and five interceptions, and he has rushed 50 times for 130 yards and a touchdown. Ohio State averaged 10.2 yards per play in the opening win at Virginia Tech, but the offense has been inconsistent since then. \nWith Jones' raw talent and the talent around him, the offense has worked just fine at times, but only when Barrett is in the game do all the parts seem to fit together. Barrett is the beset point guard for this offense, which is why Ohio State started to turn to him in the red zone, where Jones' downfield passing is a nonfactor. Jones can run, but Barrett is more explosive and a better decision-maker in both the option and passing games. \nOver the last two weeks against Maryland, Ohio State has scored touchdowns on 11 of 12 trips to the red zone with one field goal. Barrett has thrown only six passes in those two games, completing all six, as he has been counted on more in the running game. The combination of Barrett, Elliott and Miller, plus an increased tempo, helped lead the Buckeyes to 315 rushing yards against a talented Penn State defensive front. Barrett ran 11 times for 102 yards and two touchdowns, and he also threw a pair of TDs. J.T. Barrett was outstanding tonight! Need proof? Check out this incredible TD run.

Hopefully we'll keep him very much involved. It was a difficult decision, but the red-zone production and third-down production were the two areas that made the difference. [Barrett] earned that with the way he played Saturday.\" \nBarrett has completed just 27 of 44 passes for 249 yards with four touchdowns and two picks this year, but he hasn't gotten a chance to be the full-time quarterback. We saw what he is capable of doing last season as a passer, and there's little reason to think that he won't hit his stride again -- even if he still might be looking over his shoulder at Jones, who's not exactly getting benched for good. Last season, Barrett completed 64.6 percent for 2,834 yards with 34 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, while running 171 times for 938 yards and 11 touchdowns. \nStarting Barrett won't solve every problem the Buckeyes have immediately, especially if there's still a short leash and roles are uncertain. But based on the way he's played recently, Barrett appears prepared to take the job and run with it. Ohio State will be heavily favored the next three games against Rutgers, Minnesota and Illinois, before a tough finish against Michigan State and Michigan. In other words, there's still some time to put the puzzle together before the season is on the line. \nBut even though Jones has done a lot of good for this offense, making the decision to go with Barrett now puts Ohio State on the right track to maximizing its potential. \n* * * Contact Matt at matt.brown5082@gmail.com and follow him on Twitter @MattBrownCFB and Facebook .
