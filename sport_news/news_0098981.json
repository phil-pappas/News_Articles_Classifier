Ameer Abdullah was benched for ball-security issues last week. Joique Bell has looked old in the rare instances he has been on the field. And Theo Riddick, the Lions’ most effective 2-minute option, is questionable today because of a groin injury. \nAbdullah, who leads the Lions with 131 yards on 40 carries, should be front and center in the backfield today. The Lions don’t plan to restrict his playing time after he fumbled twice (and lost one) last week. Bell should be back after missing two games with an Achilles injury, but Zach Zenner should be Abdullah’s backup. \nThe Bears rank 24th in the league in rushing defense at 118.8 yards per game, and that number would be worse if two of the best running backs they’ve faced — Marshawn Lynch and Jamaal Charles — hadn’t left their games with injuries. Chicago does have good run defenders in its front seven in Pernell McPhee and Jeremiah Ratliff. \nEdge: Bears \nLions’ pass offense vs. Bears’ pass defense \nAll eyes will be on Matthew Stafford after he was benched in the third quarter of last week’s loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Stafford threw three interceptions and has an NFL-worst eight overall. \nStafford hasn’t had a great season, but he’s not getting much help. The Lions have a myriad of issues on their offensive line, though Larry Warford could return in an undetermined role today. Eric Ebron is out with a knee injury. And top receivers Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate have been void of the big play. \nChicago’s secondary is suspect, though rookie Adrian Amos has played well at safety. Up front, McPhee has had success rushing the passer, but the Bears have only nine sacks as a team and rank 28th in the league in opponent passer rating (105.8). \nEdge: Bears \nBears’ run offense vs. Lions’ run \ndefense \nMatt Forte is a couple of months shy of his 30th birthday, an age when running-back production tends to fall off a cliff, but he’s still one of the most productive all-around players in the NFL. \nForte led all running backs in yards entering this week (Atlanta’s Devonta Freeman passed him Thursday) and is a focal point of everything the Bears do on offense. He’s not much of a game-breaker these days, but he still catches the ball well and picks up tough yards between the tackles. \nThe Lions don’t have many playmakers left in their front seven with Haloti Ngata out with a calf injury and DeAndre Levy likely done for the season because of hip surgery. Stopping Forte will be the focus today, especially if Alshon Jeffery doesn’t play. But a year after they led the NFL in rush defense, the Lions rank 27th at more than 126 yards per game. \nEdge: Bears \nBears’ pass offense vs. Lions’ pass defense \nJeffery is questionable today because of a hamstring injury that has kept him out the past four games, No. 2 receiver Eddie Royal is questionable because of an ankle sprain, and tight end Martellus Bennett is questionable because of a quad injury he suffered in practice this past week. \nJay Cutler, right, has played well since missing a game with a hamstring injury, but he’s still the same mistake-prone quarterback the Bears were trying to replace in the spring. And if Jeffery, Royal and Bennett don’t play, he’ll be left with Forte and little else by his side. \nThe Lions need to pressure Cutler today and force turnovers to give their struggling offense more possessions. Ziggy Ansah is tied for the NFL lead with five sacks and Josh Bynes has played well at linebacker, but cornerback Darius Slay has gotten beat deep too many times. \nEdge: Lions \nSpecial teams \nThe Lions have come close to breaking several big returns, and they should have opportunities today against a team that has given up two kick-return touchdowns and a 64-yard punt return. It remains to be seen if the Lions will use Abdullah on kickoffs, but TJ Jones is more than capable of handling the job. \nBoth teams have solid kickers — Robbie Gould has made all 11 of his attempts, including three of 50 yards or more — but the Lions have the edge in punting, where Sam Martin has a rocket for a leg and has dropped nearly half of his 26 punts inside the 20-yard line. \nEdge: Lions \nOverall \nThe Lions played their worst overall game of the Jim Caldwell era last week, when they no-showed against the Arizona Cardinals in a six-turnover day. Players insist the locker room is strong and practices are crisp, but there’s still reason to doubt the resiliency of this team. \nFor that reason, the Lions need to have a good start today and avoid the self-inflicted mistakes that have doomed their season. The Bears have won two straight, but they’re not a good team, and they’re beaten up on offense. \nIf the Lions don’t win today, there’s not much hope for them this year. \nPick: Lions 23, Bears 20 \nLast meeting \nDec. 21, 2014 \nLions 20, Bears 14: The defense held Chicago to 64 rushing yards in the Lions’ last victory — they’re 0-7 since. \nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.
