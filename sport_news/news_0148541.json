The San Francisco 49ers then released him. The Raiders signed him five weeks later.\nIn a separate incident, Smith was arrested April 13, 2014, at Los Angeles International Airport. Police said Smith was randomly selected for a secondary screening and became uncooperative with the process, telling a TSA agent that he had a bomb. No charges were filed.\nDuring the 2014 season, he received a nine-game suspension for what the league called violations of its policies on substance abuse and personal conduct.\n__\nThis story has been corrected that Smith now plays for the Oakland Raiders.\nMore News From Our News Partners Deadly Not what you think: Teacher strips in class to teach her students a lesson SUV hangs from power line, pole after bad crash in uptown Double amputee plays football for Okla. high school ", "external_links": ["http://www.wsoctv.com/news/news/national/car-hanging-power-pole-after-bad-crash-uptown/nnxxk/", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/news/national/west-florida-school-district-settles-student-hypno/nnxtf/", "http://www.wftv.com/news/news/national/missing-king-cobra-captured/nnxr7/", "http://www.fox23.com/news/news/national/double-amputee-takes-varsity-play/nnxx2/", "http://www.news965.com/news/news/education/not-what-you-think-teacher-strips-class-teach-her-/nnxwW/", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:16:11.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
