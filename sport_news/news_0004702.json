The Blue Devils (1-4 MCC, 2-5 overall) have lost three straight games and four of their last five, while the Falcons (2-3, 4-3) will limp into Borleske Stadium after absoring defeat in their last two times out. Though emotions may have been running a little higher this week with Senior Night approaching, Wa-Hi coach Eric Hisaw said game-type preparation has stayed the same as past weeks. “It’s been a workman-like attitude (this week),” Hisaw said. “We’ve had good practices. We’re focused on Hanford, but we want to send (the seniors) out the right way. It’s about them and winning the ballgame.” Wa-Hi is coming off a 36-13 loss to Chiawana. The Blue Devils trailed 27-0 at halftime and allowed 20 points in the second quarter. “We didn’t respond to the challenge very well,” Hisaw said. “The second quarter was not very good football by us and very good football by them. We were much better and more physical in the second half. “Hopefully we learned some things and take them into Friday.” Despite a sub-100-yard passing performance a week ago, Wa-Hi’s Mitch Lesmeister still ranks as one of the league’s top quarterbacks. He has completed 88-of-159 pass for 961 yards and 12 touchdowns. Twenty-five of Lesmeister’s passes have gone to wide receiver J.C. Wicklund, who has netted 281 yards on those tosses and scored four TDs. He ranks third among MCC pass catchers. Hanford comes into Friday’s contest with a league-best 1,791 yards passing. Its quarterbacks — Josh Fonner and Desmond Samples — have combined for 125 completions. The Falcons have five receivers that have caught at least 15 passes led by 23 receptions of Elwood Davis (193 yards gained and one TD). Those 23 grabs are good for fourth best in the league. Tayvonne Miller (18-163-1) and Kedrick Skinner (17-357-3) rank eighth and ninth, respectively, in catches. Gavin Slack (15-323-4) and Kevon Skinner (15-261-3) represent two more capable targets in the Falcons’ passing game. “They are dangerous at the skill positions,” Hisaw said. “They are really athletic on the outside. They are not huge up front, but they are good on offense. They scare you.” While Hanford has prospered offensively, its defense has struggled to the tune of 375 yards allowed per game. “There are things we can do,” Hisaw said. “We need to be aggressive on offense, stay balanced, and be good up front and move the line of scrimmage. If we have to pass the ball 45 times or run it 45 times, we’ll need to ride the hot hand and do what it takes to win the ball game. “We’re looking for that winning taste in our mouth and that euphoric feeling in the locker room (after the game),” Hisaw said. “We need to get that back.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:36:47.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
