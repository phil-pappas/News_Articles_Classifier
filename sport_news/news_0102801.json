Franklin (2-6, 1-2) had won three of the previous four meetings between the two schools, but was outmanned against the visiting Rams (6-2, 2-1) this time around. Striking for two touchdowns in the first six minutes, Bastrop got all it would need early. Franklin Parish won the toss, deferred and tried an onside kick on the opening kickoff. Taking over at their own 42 after the kickoff caromed out of bounds in front of the Patriots' bench, the Rams needed just seven plays to activate the scoreboard. Bastrop's first three plays resulted in first downs as Desi Holmes carried for 11 yards and Jerry Powell kept for 17 and 20 yards, bringing up first-and-goal at the 10. An ineligible receiver penalty backed the Rams up to the 15. Al “Fig” Dowles then picked up 13 yards, Powell was stopped by Ricky Shaw for a loss of one, and Holmes barreled straight ahead for the touchdown from three yards out. John Tappin III and Travez Moore's third down sack disrupted the Patriots' first series, forcing FPHS to punt from its own end zone. Catching the punt on the run at the 38, Hill shot up the middle for the touchdown. Ja'Cari Jones ran the 2-point conversion, increasing the Rams' lead to 14-0 at 6:34 until halftime. Following a second straight empty possession by the Patriots, the Rams set up a their own 7. Powell completed passes to Alontae Alford for 28 yards, Josh Doaty for 19 and Isaiah Graham for 16 as the Rams advanced to the 30. However, the drive soon came to a halt as Charsdarion Hennix recovered a fumble in the backfield at the Franklin 46. Powell's 52-yard touchdown pass to Zach Madison on the Rams' next possession was negated by a penalty before Antonious Robinson's 37-yard punt pinned the Patriots inside the 10. An illegal substitution penalty and a double facemask call pushed the Patriots further back to the 2. FPHS was able to advance to the 12 before John Robinson shut down a third-and-six running play for a loss of four. Moore tipped the subsequent punt, giving the Rams a short field at the 28. Two plays later, Powell hit Dowles across the middle for a 22-yard TD strike, bringing the score to 20-0 with 3:57 remaining in the half. Bastrop finished the Patriots off with two quick scores before the break. Setting up at its own 46 following a Franklin punt, the Rams covered 54 yards on Dowles' 14-yard run, Powell's 17-yard gain and Powell's 23-yard TD toss to Alontae Alford with 1:20 on the clock. Franklin Parish set up at its own 27 after the kickoff. On second-and-eight, Bastrop defensive tackle William Lewis converted a fumble in the backfield into a 22-yard scoop and score just 20 seconds before halftime, stretching the difference to 34-0.

Putting an exclamation point on the victory, Hill cut to his left and returned the ensuing punt 52 yards to paydirt to wrap up the scoring. Franklin threatened on its next series, advancing all the way to the Bastrop 3 with the aid of a pair of personal foul flags against the Rams. Anferne Robinson and Kenton Davis combined to stop a second down running play for no gain before Lamontreya Higgins carried for two yards to bring up fourth-and-inches from the 3. A mishandled snap out of the shotgun enabled the Rams to take over on downs.
