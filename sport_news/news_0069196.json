The Spackenkill High School girls soccer team is living proof. \nSince the preseason, the Spartans have been readying themselves for the grind the end of the season offers — and it’s paid off. \nThe Spartans captured their second Mid-Hudson Athletic League championship in as many years with a 1-0 win over Wallkill Monday at Franklin D. Roosevelt in Hyde Park. \n“We’ve been waiting,” said Spackenkill coach Mike Corbett, whose Spartans improved to a spotless 16-0 overall. “We’ve been pretty competitive in MHALs the last five years. We knew this team was going to give us a really good game. Wallkill is a good team, this is a big confidence boost for us.” \nSpackenkill earned the number one seed in Section 9 Class B and will host either ninth-seeded Ellenville or eighth-seeded Highland at 2 p.m. Tuesday in the quarterfinals. \nTo ensure the MHAL title, Gabby Prichard scored 19:02 into the second half off a corner kick from Morgan Dominick. Corbett praised the play in the midfield of Dominick, Maria Barefoot and Katie Lillis. Completing the team effort, the coach credited Jessica Caunedo, Julia Riehl and Brooke Scianna on defense. \n“They were phenomenal,” Corbett said. “They were tenacious on the ball. The offense played well, but the defense is what allowed us to win.” \nSavannah Barefoot was part of that defense in goal, making four saves. \n“She hasn’t been tested a lot,” Corbett said of his keeper. “Tonight (Thursday) was a good test for her.” \nA.J.
