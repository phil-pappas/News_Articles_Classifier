The Narendra Modi government is preparing to host the country largest multi-country diplomatic engagement and the October 26-29 event is an exercise bringing together representatives from all the 54 countries of Africa. Keen to showcase the largest gathering of dignitaries, including some 40 heads of state/government, India decided to do things differently from the previous two summits — 2008 (New Delhi) and 2011 (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) — and work toward specific outcomes that promote trade and investment, blue economy and climate change besides capacity building, cooperation in science and technology, agriculture, counter terrorism and maritime security. New Delhi is also keen to move away from any perception that the effort is to catch up with China in the scramble for resources a developing economy needs. Ahead of the summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi answering a question on this from the members of media from Africa emphasised India-Africa relations was beyond strategic consideration. He underscored it is based on a strong emotional link with centuries old ties of commerce, culture and common struggle against colonialism. The summit meeting on October 29 is expected to come up with a declaration reflecting the approach with outcomes aligned with Africa vision document, Agenda 2063, which stresses sustainable development, inclusive growth and plans to play a greater role on the global stage. In the process, New Delhi plans to convey that its focus is not on the vast natural resources of Africa, unlike Beijing, and the effort is to align India’s priorities with that of the continent. On the eve of the summit, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj inaugurated a day-long India-Africa Editors’ Forum reminding the gathering that this year was historic for pushing forward the South-South cooperation, celebration of 60th anniversary of the Asian-Africa Conference, 10th anniversary of New Asian-African Strategic Partnership at Bandung where both sides worked for the post-2105 Development Agenda. India for UNSC reforms It is inconceivable that the UN Security Council today does not have any permanent representation from Africa which is the largest continent (in terms of number of countries). It is also incomprehensible that India, which represents almost one-sixth of world’s population and has all credentials to be a permanent member, is still out of it. We all need to work together to remove this anomaly and media has an important role in this - Sushma Swaraj, External Affairs Minister", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:03:30.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
